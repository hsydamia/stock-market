According to CIMB Investment Bank Bhd, 7-Eleven\u2019s slower store expansion was on the back of its current emphasis on improving existing stores, in which it had managed to refurbish 99 stores in 1H18.\u00a0 \u201c7-Eleven also shared that it will now focus on refurbishing its stores for a more refreshed store front outlook and is on track to meet its goal of 150 refurbished stores a year,\u201d CIMB analyst Kristine Wong and Walter Aw said in a note to clients today. At the same time, both Maybank and CIMB expressed their concern on 7-Eleven\u2019s earnings in FY19, which will see the bottomline by between 8.5% to 9.5% over the next two financial years. \u201cMinimum wage will raise overheads, while the decision to maintain prices post sales tax implementation may dampen margins,\u201d Maybank added. Currently, Maybank said between 80% to 90% of 7-Eleven\u2019s employees, which is equivalent to a staff force of between 13,000 and 14,000, are on the minimum wage scheme. Meanwhile, CIMB said the government\u2019s plan to roll-out a new minimum wage scheme of RM1,050 per month starting from Jan 1, 2019, could potentially increase 7-Eleven\u2019s staff cost by between RM600,000 per month to RM700,000 per month, equivalent to an annual personnel cost of between RM7.2 million and RM8.4 million. \u201cAssuming an average RM50 per month increase in minimum wage, personnel expenses could rise by about RM7 million per annum,\u201d Maybank added, noting this is equivalent to 5% of 7-Eleven\u2019s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in FY18. On Wednesday (Sept 5), the Prime Minister\u2019s Office announced that the government had decided to raise the national monthly minimum wage rate to RM1,050 beginning next year, which is a RM50 more from the current RM1,000 in Peninsular Malaysia; and RM920 in Sabah, Sarawak and Labuan. Despite the government rolling-out the Sales and Services Tax (SST) early this month, Maybank said 7-Eleven will leverage on its buyer power and intends to maintain prices at its convenience stores in the near term.\u00a0 \u201cWith the implementation of the SST from Sept 1, 2019, we understand that some suppliers have proposed to increase prices by an average of 5% to 6%,\u201d Maybank said. However, 7-Eleven has made an exception to the price of the cigarettes, which currently contributes 36% of sales in 1H18, Maybank said, adding any \u201ccost increase will be passed on to consumers.\u201d Going forward, CIMB said 7-Eleven will focus on increasing its product offerings, particularly in the ready-to-eat segment, which generates around 10% of its total annual revenue. \u201cMoving forward, it intends to introduce RTE [ready-to-eat] products in limited stores (5-10 outlets) by end-2018, to gauge consumer response,\u201d CIMB added. Given its large network of stores across the country, CIMB said 7-Eleven did not discount the possibility of setting up its own centralised kitchen, or working with a partner having \u00a0existing facilities. As for the stock recommendation, Maybank is retaining its \u201cSell\u201d call, while CIMB is keeping to its \u201cReduce\u201d call on cautious earnings outlook. Citing headwinds ahead, Maybank said it has lowered 7-Eleven\u2019s fair value, with the 12-month target price reduced by 12 sen to RM1.12, from a previous forecast of RM1.24. At current price tag that is \u201ccosting an arm and a leg\u201d, CIMB said it is keeping 7-Eleven\u2019s fair value at RM1.05, a 25.2% downside to yesterday\u2019s closing price of RM1.40. \u201cWe advise investors to stay away from the stock, pending effective execution of its long-term cost-saving initiatives,\u201d CIMB added. At noon-break, 7-Eleven shares paused at RM1.29, valuing the convenience store at a market capitalisation of RM1.59 billion."}, "1": {"date_posted": "5September2018", "title": "Aabar\u2019s RHB poser ", "article": " AABAR Investments PJS\u2019 move to place out 120.3 million of its shares in RHB Bank Bhd two weeks ago \u2014 the equivalent of about a 3% stake \u2014 was likely to test the market\u2019s appetite for potentially more paring down of its holding in the future, according to sources. \u201cThey have been looking to divest their entire [17.7%] stake, but there were no takers for such a big block, so they have to break it up. The 3% [stake sale] was likely meant to test the market\u2019s appetite for the shares,\u201d a source tells The Edge. However, the fact that the block trade was done at RM5.07 a share, the lowest end of its proposed range of RM5.07 to RM5.18, indicates weaker-than-expected demand from institutional investors. This may have the Middle Eastern investor, RHB\u2019s second largest shareholder, thinking twice about letting go of more of its remaining 14.75% stake in the same way. In any case, Aabar, an indirect subsidiary of Abu Dhabi sovereign fund Mubadala Investment Co PJSC, cannot sell more shares until a 60-day lock-up period, post-placement, is over, as per the terms of the recent exercise. According to the source, about a year ago, Aabar informed RHB of its intention to appoint an adviser to look at divestment options for its substantial stake in the bank. This was after RHB and AMMB Holdings Bhd ended discussions for a merger in August last year. Mubadala had wanted to sell non-core assets and its holding in RHB, via Aabar, was considered non-core. \u201cNo single buyer seems to have emerged for the stake, so the recent private placement exercise was not really a big surprise,\u201d the source adds. Still, it remains to be seen if Mubadala is still on the hunt for buyers. It could not immediately be reached for comment, while RHB declined to comment. Given that Aabar\u2019s stake is substantial, any single acquirer of its holding in RHB could trigger merger manoeuvres. RHB \u2014 a mid-sized lender like AMMB \u2014 is often viewed as a potential merger candidate because of its size and certain shareholders that could exit if they get a good return. The fourth largest of eight banking groups in the country by assets, RHB is 40.67%-owned by the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), while tycoon Tan Sri Ong Leong Huat of OSK Group owns 10.13%. It is understood that RHB is not currently looking at merger options. In an interview with The Edge in March, group managing director Datuk Khairussaleh Ramli insisted that, barring unexpected moves by its key shareholders, mergers and acquisitions was not part of the bank\u2019s game plan for the next five years. Banking analysts The Edge spoke to say they were not surprised that Aabar\u2019s RHB shares were sold at the lowest end of the proposed range. At RM5.07 apiece, it was a 5.4% discount to RHB\u2019s closing price of RM5.36 a day before the Aug 14 book-building exercise. \u201cIt prices in the illiquid nature of the stock, from a trading perspective. With EPF holding quite a large chunk already, and then combining that with Aabar\u2019s and OSK\u2019s stakes, liquidity is quite low,\u201d remarks a banking analyst. RHB\u2019s free float is about 20%, according to Bloomberg data. RHB\u2019s dividend yield is also not as high as some of the other banks out there, he adds. \u201cAt the time of the trade, RHB\u2019s dividend yield was about 3.4% compared with AMMB\u2019s 4.3% and CIMB Group\u2019s 4.5%.\u201d An investment banker points out that this was the first block trade done \u2014 via an accelerated book-build \u2014 since the May 9 change of government. RHB\u2019s shares fell in the days after the exercise,\u00a0 closing at RM5.07 on Aug 16 and 20 before moving up again, to RM5.25 last Friday. What was surprising to some industry observers, however, was that Aabar was willing to sell the RHB shares at below its perceived cost of entry. Recall that Aabar paid RM10.80 per share when it acquired a 24.9% stake in RHB \u2014 then known as RHB Capital Bhd \u2014 from its sister company Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) back in June 2011. The deal, at the time largely seen as a left-hand-to-right-hand transfer, valued RHB at 2.25 times book. Since then, however, the group has undergone an internal restructuring, which involved the banking unit taking over the holding company\u2019s (RHB Capital) listing status. Effectively,\u00a0 each RHB Capital share was converted into 1.3 RHB shares in June 2016. Later, Aabar did not participate in a rights issue that accompanied the internal restructuring. Hence, Aabar\u2019s effective cost of RHB shares would have come down from RM10.80, albeit, according to several analysts, not likely to the extent that Aabar made a profit from its recent sale of RHB shares. Maybank Investment Bank Research says, at RM5.07 each, the shares were \u201cdecently priced\u201d from a valuations perspective. It translated into a forward FY2019 price-earnings ratio of 8.5 times against its historical forward mean of 10.3 times, and a 14% discount to the research house\u2019s target price of RM5.90 for RHB. It maintained a \u201chold\u201d call on the bank. \u201cThere is, in our view, the risk of a share overhang on the stock given that it is not clear what Mubadala plans to do with the remaining stake it has in the banking group. Mubadala has largely been a passive investor in RHB and further disposals cannot be ruled out,\u201d it says in an Aug 15 report. ADCB had bought RHB Capital shares from the EPF in June 2008 at RM7.20 apiece then. At the time, it was well known that Low Taek Jho, the now controversial tycoon linked to 1Malaysia Development Bhd, brokered the deal. Mubadala began formal operations on May 1 last year, following the merger of two of Abu Dhabi\u2019s top investment institutions, namely International Petroleum Investment Co (IPIC) and Mubadala Development Co. Aabar is a subsidiary of IPIC. Mubadala had an asset base of AED470 billion and portfolio companies in more than 30 countries, according to its 2017 annual report. \u00a0"}, "2": {"date_posted": "4September2018", "title": "All eyes on Sapura Energy\u2019s next step post-rights issue", "article": " SAPURA Energy Bhd lost RM1.08 billion in market capitalisation in the afternoon session last Friday when its share price plunged to a record low after the group announced plans to raise up to RM4 billion via a deeply discounted rights issue to pare its debt and strengthen its core position for future growth. While investors are well aware that its balance sheet needs rejuvenating, the heavy sell-down may have been partly due to expectations that the fundraising will be done via the listing of its exploration and production (E&P) business rather than the announced cash call. The stock price plunged as much as 37.8% to 37 sen intraday last Friday before closing at 41.5 sen \u2014 still 30.25% below the previous day\u2019s close of 59.5 sen and 41.6% lower year to date. The RM3.98 billion (net proceeds of RM3.96 billion) Sapura Energy seeks to raise from investors was 1.6 times its market capitalisation of RM2.49 billion as at last Friday. The exercise entails raising up to RM3 billion from a five-for-three renounceable rights issue of ordinary shares at 30 sen apiece, which comes with free warrants on a 1-for-10 basis. As much as RM1 billion will come from a proposed two-for-five renounceable rights issue of new Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares at 41 sen each. Its largest shareholder, Sapura Technology Sdn Bhd \u2014 which is controlled by president and group CEO Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin and has a 16% stake in the company \u2014 will support the exercise with at least RM300 million. Permodalan Nasional Bhd too has indicated its support. It plans to take up its full entitlement as well as apply for excess rights renounced by other shareholders \u2014 subject to a limit to be determined later by PNB. The company, together with the unit trust funds under its management, owns about 12% of Sapura Energy. Sapura Energy\u2019s gearing should fall to 0.94 times post-exercise from 1.74 times as at Jan 31,\u00a0 with some RM190 million in interest savings per annum, assuming a 4.8% financing cost. \u201cSapura Energy is in a strong growth phase today and we are determined to capitalise on the emerging opportunities. The rights issue will enable us to strengthen our balance sheet and continue with our growth momentum, which includes bidding for and executing higher value projects globally,\u201d Shahril says in a statement. Sapura Energy, which has an order book of RM16.7 billion, says it is venturing into a larger addressable market in key regions such as the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, Australia and Asean as well as Mediterranean regions. Shahril knows the market expects at least one of its units to go for listing and lets on this much: \u201cOur businesses have grown to such a scale that it is now an opportune time for Sapura Energy to execute our strategic plan that will allow each of the businesses to have access to capital markets to pursue their growth aspirations and ride the growth wave. \u201cWe aim to further unlock the value of our businesses for our shareholders through a concerted effort to deleverage the group, enhance our equity base and ensure our businesses are well capitalised as they chart their own growth path.\u201d For FY2018 ended Jan 31, the engineering and construction division contributed 67% to the group\u2019s total revenue; the drilling division, 19%; and the E&P division, 14%. There are those who doubt if expectations of a potential listing would provide enough support for the stock price. An investment bank-backed analyst who attended the group\u2019s briefing last Friday likens Sapura Energy\u2019s cash call to Velesto Energy Bhd\u2019s (formerly UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd) RM1.8 billion rights issue last year, of which RM1.5 billion was meant for the repayment of bank borrowings. \u201cUntil today, Velesto is still trading around its rights issue price of 30 sen. Perhaps Sapura Energy has a stronger case, like it is going to list its E&P business, but provided that is really going to happen,\u201d he says. Recalling, perhaps, the Employees Provident Fund\u2019s publicly voiced dissatisfaction over executive remuneration at Sapura Energy\u2019s annual general meeting in July, another analyst who also attended the group\u2019s briefing notes that PNB is the \u201conly institutional investor committed so far\u201d. \u201cWhat about the others? It gives the impression that management may be facing challenges to convince other institutional investors,\u201d he says. Still, it is worth noting that prior to the rights announcement, 15 of 19 analysts tracked by Bloomberg had a \u201cbuy\u201d call on Sapura Energy while the remaining four had a \u201chold\u201d. Their target prices ranged from 61 sen to as high as RM1.30. \u201cThe overall tender market in the oil and gas sector is picking up. Basically, there will be more jobs plus [Sapura Energy] is going into new markets. They plan to pare their debt and have a stronger balance sheet so that they are in better shape for stronger [project] wins in the following year,\u201d Hong Leong Investment Bank research analyst Sean Lim tells The Edge. Maybank Investment Bank Bhd is the principal adviser for the corporate exercises. In a July 2 note, Maybank IB Research analyst Liaw Thong Jung says a fundraising exercise to degear the group\u2019s balance sheet is a key re-rating catalyst. \u201cSapura Energy\u2019s priority for FY2019 is to degear via fundraising exercises and listing of its E&P business. We are positive on this as a stronger balance sheet will remove a significant constraint to growth, thus a key re-rating catalyst,\u201d says Liaw, who has a RM1.20 target price and a \u201cbuy\u201d call on the counter, which closed at 62 sen on July 2. The rights issue price of 30 sen is at a 26.8% discount to the theoretical ex-rights price (TERP) of 41 sen, which was based on the five-day volume weighted average market price of the stock of 59 sen. The 49 sen exercise price of the warrants represents a premium of 19.5% to the TERP. \u00a0 \u00a0"}, "3": {"date_posted": "3September2018", "title": "Maybank earnings within analysts\u2019 expectation", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Sept 3): Malayan Banking Bhd\u2019s (Maybank) second quarter financial results were within analysts\u2019 expectations, despite lower allowances for loan impairment losses. On Thursday (Aug 30), Maybank said net profit increased 18% to RM1.96 billion in the second quarter ended June 30, 2018 (2QFY18), from RM1.66 billion a year ago, while revenue grew 5.4% to RM11.51 billion, against RM10.92 billion in 2QFY17. The group's allowances for impairment losses on loans, advances, financing and other debts decreased by RM248.1 million to RM582.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, compared with the previous corresponding quarter ended June 30, 2017, according to Maybank's filing with Bursa Malaysia. In separate research notes, CIMB Research and Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) wrote that Maybank\u2019s 1HFY18 net profit and interim dividend per share (DPS) of 25 sen were in line with their expectation. \u201cWe retain our FY18-20 forecast earnings per share and dividend discount model-based target price of RM10.00,\u201d said CIMB analyst Winson Ng. During the conference call, Ng said Maybank unveiled that its exposure to Hyflux stands at S$658.6 million, equivalent to RM1.95 billion as at end-June 2018, which is classified as impaired. \u201cWith this, it booked a loan loss provisioning of S$106.3 million (RM315.1 million) in 1QFY18 for this impaired loan. Despite this chunky provisioning, the bank is confident that it can still achieve its targeted credit charge-off rate of 40bp-45bp,\u201d Ng said. Despite the provisioning for Hyflux exposures, Maybank\u2019s 2QFY18 loan loss provisioning (LLP) declined by 29.9% year-on-year (y-o-y), partly due to the higher base a year ago. The LLP was also brought down by RM146.9 million write-back in the stage 1 loan, which we think was due to over-provisioning previously. The lower LLP in 2QFY18 helped the bank to record a strong net profit growth of 18.1% y-o-y in 2QFY18,\u201d he added. Ng has downgraded his \u201cAdd\u201d call to \u201cHold\u201d on Maybank shares, due to its unattractive valuation, as its FY19 P/E of 12.9 times is more than 1 standard deviation above its 5-year average of 11.3 times. \u201cWe had previously upgraded the stock to \u201cAdd\u201d on June 27, when it was trading at RM8.68. We prefer RHB Bank Bhd for exposure to Malaysian banks,\u201d he said. For 1HFY18, Maybank reported an increase in net profit at RM3.83 billion, from RM3.36 billion a year earlier. Revenue grew to RM23.02 billion, from RM22.2 billion a year ago, according to the group. Meanwhile, HLIB analyst Khairul Azizi Kairudin maintained HLIB\u2019s \u201cHold\u201d rating on Maybank\u2019s shares, with an unchanged target price of RM10. \u201cDespite 1HFY18 credit charge posted in line with management guidance, we believe that credit cost in the 2HFY18 will accelerate on the high side of management guidance, as we believe Maybank likely is to book lower recoveries amid weakness in ex-Malaysia asset quality,\u201d he said. Although the impairment on Hyflux account (amounted to S$602.4 million) has resulted in gross impaired loans (GIL) in Singapore operations increasing to 3.6% (from 2.3% in 1HFY17), group GIL ratio declined to 2.53% (from 2.64% in 1HFY17), with net credit cost declining to 44bps (versus 57bps in 1HFY17), mainly on the back of higher recoveries, Khairul said. \u201cWe leave our forecasts unchanged,\u201d he added. At 11am, Maybank rose 6 sen to RM10.02, with 2.16 million shares done.\u00a0"}, "4": {"date_posted": "29August2018", "title": "Asian currencies fall as dollar recovers, China trade issues back in focus", "article": " BENGALURU (Aug 29): Asian currencies weakened on Wednesday as investors booked profits on gains made earlier this week, but investors remain cautious as the Sino-US trade dispute looks set to dominate headlines in the week ahead.

Hence, it did not come as a surprise when it was reported a few weeks ago that Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Azmin Ali said the government had decided to present a white paper on FELDA at the next parliament session \u201cto expose the true situation of FELDA and [draw up] strategic rehabilitation plans.\u201d \u201cThe immediate focus of the new FELDA board and management is to rehabilitate FELDA\u2019s cash flow through discussions with its creditors to restructure loans amounting to RM8.02 billion,\u201d Azmin was quoted as saying in the local press. Most agree the agency should not have much of an issue in restructuring its debt. To recap, the agency\u2019s listing about five years ago of its unit FGV Holdings Bhd, in which it holds a 33.67% stake, was expected to bring it big gains. FGV\u2019s stock was floated at end-June 2012 and by the following week, on July 4, it hit a peak of RM4.66, giving it a market capitalisation of more than RM17 billion. Felda\u2019s stake was then worth RM5.72 billion. Today, FGV\u2019s market capitalisation is RM5.95 billion, down almost RM11 billion from its peak, which means FELDA\u2019s block of shares is now worth just slightly above RM2 billion \u2014 a decline of about 65%. FGV is required to pay RM250 million annually to its parent FELDA for 20 years as part of a land lease agreement. This is on top of a payment of 15% of operating profit from the sale of fresh fruit bunches from the land leased from FELDA. To date, FGV has paid as much as RM1.5 billion to its parent since its flotation in 2012, and has not missed any payment. However, with FGV facing problems such as low efficiency, mature plantations and issues with foreign workers, it has not been able to pay dividends lately. For FY2012, FGV paid a dividend at 14 sen, followed by 16 sen in 2013, 10 sen in FY2014 and four sen in FY2015, but could only manage one sen in FY2016. For FY2017, an interim dividend of five sen was paid but no final dividend was recommended. FELDA\u2019s 33.67% stake, or 1.23 billion shares, in FGV means that in FY2017 (stet) it received RM61.5 million in dividends, compared with RM196.8 million in FY2013. And this year also did not start off well for FGV. For its first three months of FY2018 ended March, it registered a net profit of RM1.33 million from RM3.6 billion in revenue. So, dividend payments for the current year are uncertain. The ties between FGV and FELDA run deep. FGV\u2019s annual report states there is a loan due to a significant shareholder, which is FELDA, amounting to RM1.39 billion as at end-December 2017. However, FGV also has RM222.66 million due from FELDA, according to its annual report. It is understood that although the RM1.39 billion debt is not yet due, FGV may settle a portion of it soon. While FELDA\u2019s shareholding in FGV may be its biggest shareholding, it holds various stakes in other companies as well. \u00a0 Small stakes in various companies FELDA\u2019s shareholding in several publicly traded companies is worth billions in total.A random check shows it has investments worth about RM3.28 billion in various companies listed on Bursa Malaysia. However, the shares are largely pledged. Among others, the agency has a 4.23% stake, or 45 million shares, in Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KLK), which on Aug 15\u2019s close of RM24.80, is worth RM1.12 billion. These shares are pledged with Maybank Nominees (Tempatan) Sdn Bhd and ABB Nominee (Tempatan) Sdn Bhd, a unit of Affin Bank Bhd. FELDA also has 17 million shares, or 4.23%, in Batu Kawan Bhd \u2014 the parent company of KLK. The shareholding is worth RM295.12 million, based on the counter\u2019s close last on Aug 15 of RM17.36. These shares are also pledged with Maybank Nominees and ABB Nominee. The agency has a 0.69% stake, or 47 million shares in Sime Darby Bhd worth RM121.73 million. These shares are pledged with Maybank. Following a demerger exercise, former plantation giant Sime Darby now houses the heavy equipment, motor and other businesses, while Sime Darby Plantations Bhd and Sime Darby Properties Bhd control the plantations and property development businesses respectively. Checks on Bloomberg reveal that FELDA has no equity in these two units. FELDA also has a 0.55% stake, or 8.82 million shares, in Boustead Plantations Bhd worth RM11.2 million, based on the counter\u2019s close of RM1.27 on Aug 15. In TH Plantations Bhd, FELDA has 700,000 shares or a 0.08% stake, in TH Plantations Bhd, valued at RM507,500. Apart from these plantation companies, the agency has a 1.09% stake, or 117.81 million shares in Malayan Banking Bhd, worth about RM1.15 billion, based on its close of RM9.79 on Aug 15. These shares are pledged with CIMB Group Nominees (Tempatan) Sdn Bhd. In shipping giant MISC Bhd, FELDA has a 2.07% stake, or 92.61 million shares, valued at RM562.14 million based on MISC\u2019s close of RM6.07 on Aug 15. The shares are pledged to Maybank and ABB. Apart from that, the agency has 10.3% or 44.42 million shares in Nextgreen Global Bhd (formerly BHS Global Bhd), valued at RM17.43 million. The counter closed at 37 sen on Aug 15. Via wholly owned Felda Investment Corp Sdn Bhd (FIC), FELDA holds 14.60% or 360.81 million shares in Iris (worth RM55.92 million based on its closing price of 15.5 sen on Aug 15), and 67.13% or 197.07 million shares in Encorp (worth RM98.53 million at on Aug 15 close of 50 sen). While the actual size of FELDA asset base is unclear, there could be some hidden gems. In February last year, former FELDA chairman Tan Sri Shahrir Abdul Samad clarified that contrary to speculation, the agency did not lose RM4.3 billion from the RM6 billion raised from FGV\u2019s flotation. According to him, RM1.44 billion was invested in property \u2014 RM304 million in Bukit Katil, Melaka; RM86 million Grand Borneo Hotel in Sabah; RM500 million on Grand Plaza Serviced Apartments in Bayswater, London; RM225 million on the Institut Penilaian Negara (Inspen) building; and RM110 million on Iris Corp. Some of these assets, in particular the Grand Plaza Serviced Apartments, could be worth significant sums now. \u201cFELDA has pockets of land all over the place, so there should be no problem restructuring RM8 billion of debt,\u201d a person familiar with the agency says. \u201cThe agency was established to eradicate poverty, and to a certain extent it has been successful, but FELDA settlers these days are not like before. They seem to have special rights, and are even averse to carrying out replanting themselves. This is because they are seen as a vote bank and accorded special privileges. Things have to change,\u201d he sums up. \u00a0"}, "6": {"date_posted": "27August2018", "title": "Axiata downgraded to hold at Maybank", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 27): Maybank Kim Eng analyst Tan Chi Wei downgraded the recommendation on Axiata Group Bhd to hold from buy. * Price target (PT) lowered to RM4.60 from RM4.80, implies 2.5% decrease from last close.

According to analysts, improved consumer sentiment is believed to be behind the steady rally. The Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) soared to a 21-year high of 132.9 points during the second quarter of this year, according to the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research (MIER). \u201cConsumer sentiment in the country has been weak since late 2013. With the recent improvement in the CSI, hopefully Astro can see an improvement to its subscriber base and average revenue per user (ARPU), and we can then see a gradual pickup in the company\u2019s share price,\u201d a bank-backed analyst told The Edge Financial Daily. UOB KayHian, in a note last Wednesday, attributed the appreciation in Astro\u2019s share price to not only improving consumer sentiment, but an undemanding valuation and attractive dividend yield, which were previously overshadowed by cautious investment sentiment and concerns over its earnings prospects. At the current share price of RM1.82, Astro\u2019s dividend yield works out to 6.87%, more than double the prevailing fixed deposit rates in the country. In a July 3 note on the media sector, TA Securities wrote that Astro\u2019s dividend paying ability would remain supported by its pay-TV subscription\u2019s stable cash flows. \u201cHowever, management had recently stated its intentions to maintain its reduced quarterly dividend of 2.5 sen per share versus three sen per share a year ago for the rest of the financial year and accordingly assess the payout of a final dividend,\u201d the firm noted. Meanwhile, regulatory concerns over Astro\u2019s monopoly status are overblown given that its exclusive direct-to-home (DTH) licence had already expired in early 2017, according to AllianceDBS Research in an Aug 1 note. \u201cDespite being a dominant player in the pay-TV market, we do not think that Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) harbours any views that Astro is anti-competitive or has abused its dominant position. \u201cIn fact, based on our conversation with MCMC, the regulator understands the changes in consumers\u2019 TV viewing habit and is of the view that Astro faces competition from other platforms such as online streaming services (both legal and illegal),\u201d the firm said. According to Astro\u2019s prospectus, its wholly-owned unit, Measat Broadcast Network Systems Sdn Bhd, was granted a renewable 25-year broadcasting licence for the provision of broadcasting services in Malaysia, with exclusivity on DTH satellite TV services until 2017 and non-exclusivity until 2022. AllianceDBS also noted that unlike the case of Telekom Malaysia Bhd in the fixed broadband market, Astro\u2019s pricing and content offering are actually quite in line with regional peers, after accounting for foreign exchange differences of about US$24 (RM98.53) to US$25, based on an ARPU of RM99. On another note, Maybank IB Research noted that it is too early to tell if Astro\u2019s commercial broadcasting in Ultra High Definition (UHD) will be a game changer like the High Definition (HD) that it launched in 2009. \u201cWe understand that the ARPU for pay-TV subscribers who take-up HD content is more than RM100 while the ARPU for pay-TV subscribers who do not is approximately RM75. \u201cAstro plans to offer UHD content to SuperPack subscribers who yield ARPUs of more than RM140 at no extra cost to them to retain and attract new SuperPack subscribers. With intense competition from Android TV boxes, it remains to be seen how well UHD content will be taken up. \u00a0Nine out of 20 analysts polled on Bloomberg have a \u201cbuy\u201d call on the stock, while the rest put it on \u201chold\u201d.

In 1QFY19, Astro\u2019s net profit declined 10.8% to RM174.73 million from RM195.82 million a year ago due to higher net finance costs, while revenue slipped 1.1% to RM1.31 billion from RM1.33 billion."}, "11": {"date_posted": "17August2018", "title": "Economists turn bearish, slash forecasts ahead of 2Q GDP release", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: Just days ahead of Bank Negara Malaysia\u2019s release of the second quarter of 2018\u2019s (2Q18) gross domestic product (GDP) growth figure today, economists have cut their forecasts amid weak economic data from June. Indices for industrial production and services were weaker than expected while disappointing crude palm oil (CPO) production data also dampened sentiment, amid a slowdown in private investment, economists told The Edge Financial Daily. According to 21 economists tracked by Bloomberg, the average estimate for 2Q18 GDP growth is 5.21% year-on-year (y-o-y). However, a number of local research houses recently cut their forecasts to below 5%, including Maybank Investment Bank (IB) Research, CIMB Research, MIDF Research and Hong Leong Investment Bank Research. \u201cThe main reason for our downgrade was the slowdown in the services index, which was led by a sharp slowdown in financial services, and the disappointing [results of] the Industrial Production Index (IPI), which saw a sharp contraction in natural gas output,\u201d CIMB economist Michelle Chia said. Speaking to the daily, she noted that volatility in global financial markets and lower liquidity ahead of the 14th general election (GE14) had resulted in the lower demand for financial services. On top of that, weaker agricultural data had led to the lowering of CIMB\u2019s forecast GDP growth for the quarter to 4.9% from 5.2% previously. Lee Heng Guie, executive director of the Socio-Economic Research Centre (SERC), also cited agricultural data in the form of lower CPO and poor IPI data, as reasons to lower his 2Q18 GDP forecast to 4.9%. \u201cThe underlying growth momentum will moderate further in the second half of 2018 due to the US-China trade war, negative sentiment over emerging market currencies due to the pressure on the lira and volatility in the stock market,\u201d he told The Edge Financial Daily. In early July, SERC had revised downward its 2Q18 GDP growth projection to 5.4% from an initial 5.7%, citing external headwinds such as an escalating US-China trade war and domestic developments. Meanwhile, Maybank IB Research economist Suhaimi Illias posed a slightly more pessimistic outlook of 4.8% GDP growth for the previous quarter, mainly on the back of slower growth in the Manufacturing Production Index, on top of the abovementioned factors. In a report on Tuesday, he pinpointed slower growth in export-oriented industries as well as domestic-oriented industries, noting that the unexpected holidays following the GE14 in May and Hari Raya Aidilfitri holidays in June had also affected output growth. While growing trade tensions between the US and China are viewed as significant downside risks, there has not been any direct evidence of negative impacts on Malaysian exports so far, CIMB\u2019s Chia said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to gauge exactly which sectors will be affected, but the tariffs (of US$34 billion [139.4 billion] each from both sides) that were effective July will definitely affect some sectors,\u201d Chia said. She added that the additional tariffs to be implemented in August, which will affect a total of US$32 billion worth of US and Chinese goods, will provide a further downward kick to Malaysia\u2019s economy. Meanwhile, strong consumer sentiment from the zero-rating of the goods and services tax is not expected to significantly lift Malaysia\u2019s full-year GDP, as Chia believes consumers are simply bringing forward year-end spending. Meanwhile, SERC\u2019s Lee voiced concern over the rapidly deteriorating growth in private investment, noting that investors are still waiting for clues from the new government to its policies, which will likely be made clear following Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad\u2019s trip to China beginning today and the federal budget to be announced in November. \u201cI think we would have to prepare for very subdued private investments in the third and fourth quarters,\u201d he said.

Those with a relatively bigger dependency on investment banking income and with greater exposure to large corporates may be the most affected. They would include CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) and RHB Bank Bhd, analysts say. \u201cTheir non-interest income (NOII) would have slowed down significantly because it has been quiet on the equity and debt capital markets, and in terms of trading activity. And, corporate lending has been slow,\u201d points out a banking analyst from a local brokerage. However, banks with a stronger focus on the consumer or retail banking operations, such as Public Bank Bhd, are expected to hold up well. Several bankers The Edge spoke to have the same sentiment \u2014 that it has been tough to grow revenue in the quarter amid increased uncertainty and challenges, both at home and abroad. \u201cAll the banks\u2019 revenues should be affected, for sure. Revenue lines \u2026 we\u2019re seeing them coming from the SME (small and medium enterprise) and retail space, but it\u2019s been tough in the corporate and investment banking space. Bond-issuance jobs we were expecting to get are now not coming through after certain infrastructure projects were either cut or shelved [by the new government or companies themselves],\u201d a senior bank executive tells The Edge. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough market. We\u2019re pushing like crazy to get deposits, CASA (current account, savings account), assuming that loan growth would compensate for it ... but people are just cautious about spending, overall. And, without much clarity on the [upcoming] Sales and Services Tax, people are just adopting a wait-and-see attitude about spending.\u201d According to an official from another bank, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, \u201cthings have improved now, but there was a point [during the second quarter] that we were struggling to meet our monthly loan targets\u201d. Still, analysts expect domestic loan growth in 2Q to be decent and possibly higher than that in 1Q. Most are not changing their full-year loan growth forecasts. It should also be noted that several banks that had undergone cost-cutting/transformation programmes, such as AMMB Holdings Bhd and Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd, could see their earnings hold up as cost-savings filter through. \u201cWhile banks\u2019 NOII would be affected, I would say loan growth [in 2Q] will still be okay. Except for the large corporates, which are more affected by the uncertainty around policy and regulations, loans in the consumer and mid-sized segments are doing better. So, while we expect bank earnings to be softer quarter on quarter due to the weaker market conditions, they\u2019re not going to be devastatingly bad,\u201d remarks another banking analyst. Early last month, he cut his full-year earnings growth forecast for banks to 7.6% from over 9% to adjust for the expected lower NOII. Last year, earnings of banks under his coverage grew 10.6%. However, he expects this year\u2019s loan growth to be higher at 5%, compared with 4.1% last year. Bank Negara Malaysia\u2019s latest statistics show that loans in the banking system as at June grew 5.2% on an annualised basis.\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s more critical than loan growth is whether the banks\u2019 margins will hold up. While the latest Bank Negara statistics seem to show that margins are indeed holding up, I don\u2019t know whether it applies to the individual banks,\u201d points out another analyst. The average lending rate in the banking system rose to 5.05% as at end-June from 4.61% in end-December. Analysts say this could be due to improvements in banks\u2019 portfolio mix and loans being repriced following the overnight policy rate hike last January. As a result, interest spreads have been widening \u2014 the current spread of 1.86% is the highest banks have seen since January 2012. Domestic-centric banks could see \u201cstable to slightly better\u201d margins in 2Q, but those with regional exposure, such as CIMB Group and Maybank, may see margins compress, the earlier analyst says. \u201cThe increase in capital market volatility, coupled with the challenging net interest margin (NIM) environment in Indonesia, could weigh on CIMB Group\u2019s NOII and NIM outlook in 2Q and this year. However, its management indicated that a pick-up in consumer loan growth in Malaysia (mainly mortgages), lower-than-expected net credit costs across its key markets and solid operating cost discipline could partially offset the weakness,\u201d says UOB Kay Hian Research in a July 26 report on the group. NOII accounted for just under 30% of CIMB Group\u2019s and Maybank\u2019s total income in FY2017. Analysts will also be watching out for provision risk from Maybank due to its exposure to financially distressed Hyflux Ltd, a Singaporean water treatment company. \u201cIt remains a concern and we hope to get some clarity from Maybank soon,\u201d says one of them. Analysts note that the three-month zero-GST period that began in June, which boosted car sales, will only have an impact in the third quarter. \u201cThe tax-free period hasn\u2019t filtered through yet. June didn\u2019t see a pick-up in automotive lending, for instance, but loan applications and approvals were up, which means it will only filter through in July and August,\u201d remarks one. Public-listed banks will have to announce their April-to-June financial results by the end of this month, with Public Bank usually the first to kick off. Bank valuations are compellingly low amid an overall weaker stock market and analysts are advising investors to buy selectively. UOB Kay Hian, in a report on the banking sector on Aug 1, notes that the post-election macro policy uncertainty could have a dampening effect on the sector\u2019s growth and result in downside risk to earnings. \u201cGiven this scenario, we advocate a two-pronged strategy to navigate the potentially near-term sector outlook with a focus on banking stocks with defensive earnings qualities and those that have been excessively sold down due to sentiment rather than material changes in fundamentals,\u201d it says. In that respect, it likes Public Bank and CIMB Group.\u00a0\n\u00a0"}, "16": {"date_posted": "14August2018", "title": "Ann Joo\u2019s FY18 profit seen better on stable sales, higher margins", "article": " Ann Joo Resources Bhd\n(Aug 13, RM2.08)\nMaintain buy with a target price (TP) of RM2.60: Ann Joo Resources Bhd\u2019s share price has fallen 46% year to date due to the implementation of the US steel import tariff, the review of local megaprojects and the electricity tariff hike. We lower our financial year ending Dec 31, 2018 estimated (FY18E) to FY20E earnings per share (EPS) by 3% to 13% on our expectations of weaker local demand in the second half of 2018 (2H18) and higher electricity cost from 2H18. Consequently, our TP is lowered to RM2.60 (-15%), based on an unchanged eight times FY18 price-earnings ratio (PER) (-0.5 standard deviation to the mean). We think the stock is oversold with its 12-month rolling forward PER at six times (mean: 10 times). Ann Joo\u2019s second quarter of FY18 (2QFY18) earnings could be weaker quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) (1QFY18: RM61 million net profit) as sales volume was affected by slower construction work during the Ramadan/Hari Raya period and uncertainties post-14th general election. Additionally, margins could also be weaker q-o-q due to the mismatch between raw material costs and average selling prices. However, on a year-on-year basis, earnings could be better on our expectation of a stable sales volume and higher margins. Among the megaprojects that are being reviewed or cancelled, only the East Coast Rail Link has contributed to domestic steel demand but the contribution is limited to less than 1% of industry demand. However, we expect overall domestic demand to be softer in 2H18 as contractors and distributors have turned more cautious about buying given the uncertainties. As such, we think Ann Joo may offload its production in the export market, which is of lower margins. As for the recently implemented US import tariff on steel products, we think dumping into Southeast Asia could be limited as countries exporting steel near this region have minimal exports of long steel to the US. Our FY18E to FY20E EPS are cut by 13%/3%/4% respectively as we update Ann Joo\u2019s latest share base (+3%) and assumed for: i) a higher export sales volume in FY18 (30% of the total sales volume, from 20%) given our expectations of softer domestic demand; and ii) a higher electricity tariff (+8% from 2H18), which works out to be higher cost of about RM6 million per annum (or 3% of net profit). Meanwhile, the impact of a higher gas tariff (from July 2018) is muted as the tariff was raised by a mere 0.5% and Ann Joo consumes very little gas. \u2014 Maybank IB Research, Aug 13"}, "17": {"date_posted": "12August2018", "title": "Cover Story: Is bigger better?", "article": " There is a common perception among retail investors that the larger asset management companies tend to outperform their smaller counterparts in the market.

The top three performing funds in the past three years were Hong Leong Dividend, Libra DividendExtra Fund and Affin Hwang Select Dividend, which generated cumulative returns of 44.72%, 39.36% and 32.41% respectively. They were followed by Eastspring Investments Equity Income (31.36%) and AMB Dividend Trust (23.44%). The outperformers in the income category for the past five years were Eastspring Investments Equity Income, which saw a cumulative return of 62.33%, Libra DividendExtra Fund (61.22%), Hong Leong Dividend (57.79%), Affin Hwang Select Dividend (57.24%) and AMB Dividend Trust (46.87%). It is essential to note that this analysis is on the top three unit trusts of most fund houses in the Malaysian equity universe. Fund houses that did not perform well in this universe may have performed better in other asset classes or regions. The six largest fund houses by assets under management (AUM) as at end-2017 were Public Mutual Bhd (RM81.44 billion), CIMB-Principal Asset Management Bhd (RM74 billion), Affin Hwang Asset Management Bhd (RM55.1 billion), RHB Asset Management Bhd (RM47.37 billion), Eastspring Investments Bhd (RM39.8 billion) and AmInvest (RM36.1 billion), the asset management arm of AmBank Group. \u00a0 Fund size matters There are several reasons big fund houses tend to perform better in the large-cap category while smaller fund houses do well in the mid-to-small-cap space, says Areca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong. For one, big fund houses tend to manage large funds. And the larger the fund, the more it would benefit from a large-cap stock rally. (According to Wong, large funds have about RM1 billion under management while small funds manage RM300 million or less.) These rallies occur when market sentiment turns defensive and investors start pouring money into large-cap stocks, which have stronger fundamentals, more visible earnings and stable dividend payouts. The manager of a big fund would have sufficient capital to deploy into the market to snap up large-cap stocks, which tend to be more expensive than other types of stocks. On the other hand, smaller funds are better positioned to ride the mid-to-small-cap stock rally, says Wong. These funds also provide their managers more flexibility to move in and out of the market faster, which means selling or buying shares quickly at the desired price when market sentiment changes. For instance, say the manager of a RM1 billion fund spots an opportunity to buy into a small-cap company and wants to allocate 5% of his portfolio to the stock, he would find it extremely challenging to do so, says Wong. \u201cThe fund manager cannot do that. How can he buy 50 million shares on the open market without pushing the share price up? Or sell without pushing it down? The share price would move against him.\u201d By comparison, the manager of a RM300 million fund could easily buy 15 million shares of the small-cap company and allocate 5% of his portfolio to the stock. He could also trade the stock without moving the share price against him. \u201cIndustry players say smaller funds are more nimble,\u201d notes Wong. Richard Cheong, vice-president of investment at Phillip Mutual Bhd and fund manager of the Phillip Master Equity Growth Fund, shares this view. \u201cSome companies were too small for the big funds to buy into. But we invested in them and grew together with them over the years,\u201d he says. As at April 23, the top five holdings of Areca Equity Trust were Supermax Corp Bhd, Pentamaster Corp Bhd, RHB Bank Bhd, Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd and MI Equipment Holdings Bhd. The top five holdings of the Phillip Master Equity Growth Fund as at June 30 were Samchem Holdings Bhd, Perak Transit Bhd, Nova Wellness Group Bhd, JF Technology Bhd and Denko Industrial Corp Bhd. \u00a0 Stock selection remains key The Morningstar data show that fund size is not the only thing that determines the performance of a unit trust fund. For example, in the Malaysian equity large-cap category, one of the top-performing funds was Affin Hwang Select Opportunity. It was one of the largest funds in this space, with RM994 million under management. But another outperformer in this category \u2014 InterPac Dynamic Equity \u2014 only had a fund size of RM8.41 million. While it is true that most top-performing funds in the mid-to-small-cap space have RM500 million or less under management, the top-performing Kenanga Growth Fund had AUM of RM1.4 billion while the second-best performer \u2014 Eastspring Investment Small-cap \u2014 had RM679 million under management as at May 29, according to its fund fact sheet. Ismitz Matthew De Alwis, CEO of Kenanga Investors Bhd, says investment strategy and stock selection based on solid research by fund managers and their research teams are more important than fund size. \u201cFund performance is more driven by the investment strategy rather than the size of the firm [and fund]. Different investment strategies outperform in different market cycles. Our team is extremely focused on conducting research and investing in undervalued stocks,\u201d he adds. The top five holdings of the Kenanga Growth Fund as at June 30 were Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd, Dialog Group Bhd, Yinson Holdings Bhd and Petronas Chemicals Groups Bhd. Gan Eng Peng, director of equity strategies and advisory at Affin Hwang Asset Management, says the team behind Affin Hwang Select Opportunity has been striving hard to identify new investment strategies and bottom-up stock ideas as the fund size has grown. He elaborates on how the fund managed to outperform its peers last year. Gan was an early buyer of large-cap banking stocks as he thought the counters were oversold and undervalued on the back of an improving local and global economic backdrop. He also invested in the real estate investment trust sector, with a view that the abundance of liquidity in the local market would drive prices higher. There was also a restructuring play, where the fund invested in listed companies that had Permodalan Nasional Bhd as one of their major shareholders. That was because a new management group, which included Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar, had joined PNB. The market believed a restructuring would happen under his watch. \u201cOther big bottom-up ideas included investing in an aluminium smelter company, a politically connected construction company and a regional food and beverage and tank farm operator,\u201d says Gan. Nevertheless, it is getting more challenging for him and his team to maintain the fund\u2019s performance as it has continued to grow over the years. They have to work harder to identify more investment ideas and opportunities with the growing amount of investor money. \u201cThe strong performance of the fund and active promotion by various distribution channels resulted in the doubling of the fund size last year. This was challenging as positions needed to be constantly rebalanced ... and there was a constant search for new ideas throughout the year,\u201d says Gan. The top five holdings of the fund as at May 31 were CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd, Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd and Petronas Dagangan Bhd. \u00a0 Take note of volatility \u00a0 When studying the performance of a unit trust fund, investors should do more than just look at the returns generated. They should also look at the volatility level of the fund as the last thing they want is to react emotionally to market swings and sell their holdings when prices are low. Volatility is expressed by the standard deviation assigned to the funds. Simply put, the term reflects how far the returns of each fund could deviate from its average return over the years. The higher the standard deviation, the more volatile the fund performance, and vice versa. According to the Morningstar data, the standard deviation of Malaysian large-cap equity funds from 2015 to 2017 ranged from 1.94 to 3.23 while the average and median standard deviation were 2.53 and 2.45 respectively. By comparison, the standard deviation of local mid-to-small-cap equity funds ranged from 1.86 to 5.01 while the average and median standard deviation were 3.22 and 3.65 respectively. From 2013 to 2017, the standard deviation of large-cap funds ranged from 1.94 to 3.1 while the average and median standard deviation were 2.51 and 2.55 respectively. The standard deviation of mid-to-small-cap funds ranged from 2.17 to 4.88 while the average and median standard deviation were 3.39 and 3.28 respectively. It is not surprising that small-cap companies are often associated with volatile share price movements and that their stocks usually make up a higher percentage of mid-to-small-cap funds\u2019 portfolios. This translates into higher standard deviations of these funds. From 2015 to 2017, the standard deviation of Malaysian equity income funds ranged from 1.71 to 4.31 while the average and median standard deviation were 2.43 and 2.2 respectively. From 2013 to 2017, the standard deviation ranged from 1.66 to 4.31 while the average and median standard deviation were 2.36 and 2.27 respectively. \u00a0 How should investors pick their funds? Financial planners say retail investors should do more due diligence before buying into unit trusts, and not buy into funds just because they are associated with a famous brand name and have more market exposure. \u201cFund performance has little correlation with brand name and market exposure. The key is the fund manager, investment team and processes. Some smaller fund houses may have these capabilities, but do not have the budget to conduct branding and marketing activities,\u201d says Yap Ming Hui, founder and managing director of Whitman Independent Advisors Sdn Bhd. Bryan Zeng, general manager of FA Advisory Sdn Bhd, says passively buying into funds based on their brand name is not the right move. Investors should compare and assess funds from various perspectives before making a decision. The risk-adjusted returns, represented by the Sharpe ratio, is an important metric that Zeng uses. The higher the ratio, the better the risk-adjusted returns. This ratio is also favoured by Kevin Neoh, a licensed financial planner at VKA Wealth Planners Sdn Bhd. \u201cI recommend that investors check out this ratio of the funds from the same category. It tells us how many units of risk the fund manager has to undertake to generate one unit of return. Generally, an equity fund with a Sharpe ratio of 0.5 is considered reasonably acceptable,\u201d he says. It is essential that investors look at the fees that are imposed on them, such as the sales charge, says Zeng. \u201cInvestors need to understand that any fees charged by the fund house are a drag on the returns they receive from the funds. This factor must be taken into account before buying into a fund.\u201d He debunks the belief that better-performing funds impose a higher sales charge on investors. \u201cThe sales charge should be determined by the services provided to the investors. It should not be purely based on past performance because past performance does not guarantee future performance,\u201d he says. Those who invest in equity funds via unit trust agents are typically charged a 5% to 6.5% sales fee. However, those who can make their own investment decisions could buy into funds with a sales charge of 2% or lower via online portals such as fundsupermart.com. Fund size and fund managers are the two things investors should be aware of, says Zeng. He adds that an equity fund size of less than RM10 million is too small and \u201cmay not be adequately diversified\u201d. It is also likely to entail a higher management expense ratio (MER), which will be a drag on the fund\u2019s performance. The MER is the cost of managing and operating a fund. The expenses are generally fixed costs such as management, legal and auditor fees. Funds with higher returns and lower MERs are preferable. The fund manager is crucial to the success of the fund. \u201cKnowing the fund manager is similar to knowing the management of listed companies. Investors should get a chance to know the fund manager\u2019s investment philosophy, risk management framework and thought process,\u201d says Zeng. Neoh says the portfolio turnover rate (PTR) is another factor that investors can look at. The rate tells them how frequent a fund buys or sells its holdings over a 12-month period. A higher PTR indicates that the fund is trading more actively. It is worth noting that the trading and brokerage fees used to measure a fund\u2019s PTR are not included in the MER. Investors would need to make the effort to obtain such information. For instance, the fund size is readily available on the fund\u2019s fact sheet. As for the fund\u2019s Sharpe ratio, investors can log on to Morningstar\u2019s website. The Lipper Leaders website allows the public to screen funds, enabling them to gauge the funds\u2019 volatility level via its \u201cPreservation\u201d score of one to five \u2014 the lower the rating, the higher the volatility. The MER and PTR are available in the fund\u2019s annual report. Yap says investors should attend events organised by fund houses to listen to their fund manager\u2019s views or to ask them questions. Alternatively, investors can rely on the historical returns and ratings of investment research firms, such as Morningstar and Thomson Reuters Lipper, to have a sense of how each fund has been performing. Yap suggests that investors look at these metrics from a three-year perspective. That is because one year is too short to make a sound assessment while five years is too long. \u201cThat is because the fund manager may have left and the investing mandate could change after five years, say, from investing only in Malaysian equities to investing in Asian equities. We would reassess the fund in this case as it would no longer fall under the Malaysian equity category,\u201d he says. Financial planners say the most important thing investors should know is their investment objectives, time frame, risk appetite and preferred asset allocation. After all, they should bear in mind that the ultimate goal of investing is to achieve their short and long-term financial goals."}, "18": {"date_posted": "10August2018", "title": "Star Media's board sees new director, another director resigns", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 10): Former Tradewinds Plantation Bhd chief executive officer (CEO) Chan Seng Fatt will join the board of directors of Star Media Group Bhd effective tomorrow (Aug 11).

Group revenues fell 0.5% to S$3.84 billion during the quarter, with cargo and passenger revenues rising but not by enough to cover the lack of one-off items from the prior year. Singapore Airlines said passenger traffic was expected to grow in the coming months, but costs remained under pressure, especially from higher fuel prices. Fuel costs rose by S$154 million from a year earlier. The company has hedged 46.3% of its fuel for the remaining nine months of the financial year. In the first quarter yields at the parent brand fell by 1%, although it filled a higher percentage of seats to boost overall revenue. Low-cost subsidiary Scoot and SilkAir posted a combined S$1 million in operating profits, down from S$11 million the prior year. Scoot's yields fell by 1.8%. Singapore Airlines had topped market expectations in May by reporting a 148% rise in full-year net profit to the highest level since 2011, as passenger and cargo revenue rose and it benefited from a transformation programme designed to help cut costs and boost revenue.

The group of companies affected included the Renong/UEM conglomerate, the MAS/TRI/Celcom group and the trio of MRCB/TV3/NSTP. All were controlled by individual businessmen. After their debts were restructured new capital was injected. The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) ended up in control of MRCB, TV 3 and NSTP. The other assets, however, ended up with Khazanah Nasional Bhd, the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. Khazanah was started in 1993 under the Minister of Finance Inc (MoF Inc) to play a \u201c catalytic role in driving various strategic and national initiatives\u201d. Its involvement in the economy and corporate sector was transformed in a major way when it was tasked to take over those assets whose ownership had to be shifted to the government after the AFC. The term government-linked companies (GLCs) came into being in Malaysia after that. GLCs refer to privately incorporated companies (listed and unlisted) that are owned or controlled by the government. Khazanah itself is deemed a government-linked investment company (GLIC), as are Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB), the EPF, Kumpulan Wang Amanah Pencen (KWAP), Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera (LTAT) and Lembaga Tabung Haji (LUTH). Collectively these GLICs control a large component of companies listed on Bursa Malaysia. PNB, EPF and Khazanah are the biggest GLICs. The takeover of these companies and assets were not without issues and both Tan Sri Halim Saad (Renong/UEM) and Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli (MAS/TRI/Celcom) subsequently filed various lawsuits against the government and Khazanah, but lost. With important assets under it, Khazanah modelled itself after Singapore\u2019s Temasek Holdings and over the past 12 years, grew its portfolio of both listed and unlisted assets and equities. Its realisable asset value as of Dec 31, 2017, was RM157.2 billion ringgit. After deducting debts and other liabilities, Khazanah\u2019s net worth would be around RM116 billion. The value of its stakes in various listed companies on Bursa Malaysia as at July 10 was RM84 billion (see Table 1). \u00a0These included controlling stakes in some of the country\u2019s biggest companies like Axiata Group Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd. Given that the stock market has taken a pounding in the last two months, the value of these holdings could be worth much more. Khazanah also fully owns unlisted UEM Group Bhd and Malaysia Airlines Bhd (MAS). It has a 51% stake in PLUS Malaysia Bhd, with the EPF owning the remaining 49%. In 2017, Khazanah received RM2.367 billion in dividends from its core listed holdings, up from RM1.757 billion in 2016 (see Table 2). Since 2004, Khazanah has made accumulated profit before tax of RM28 billion and paid RM10.11 billion in dividends to MoF Inc (see Table 3). Another jewel is Khaznah\u2019s 60% interest in the M+S joint venture with Singapore\u2019s Temasek Holdings. The JV developed two projects \u2014 Marina One in Marina Bay and Duo in Bugis \u2014 that were the result of a 2010 land swap deal between the two governments. According to an M+S statement in January, the two projects had a gross development value of S$11 billion or RM33 billion. The land cost and shareholders injection was around S$4.0 billion and after deducting development costs, it is estimated that the profit could be as much as S$3.0 billion It is understood that M+S could generate around RM12 billion cash, including a profit of RM5.4 billion, for Khazanah if it sells the 60% stake. Will Khazanah assets be sold to raise cash for the government? In 2001, Khazanah was the vehicle used by the government to rehabilitate strategic assets back to good financial health. Given that Khazanah is today sitting on assets easily worth more than RM120 billion, will the government again turn to its sovereign wealth fund for help? The difference now is that this means Khazanah selling its assets to raise cash for the government. On paper, a sale of all Khazanah assets can raise over RM120 billion cash or around 12% of the governments RM1.0 trillion debt and contingent liabilities. This will certainly help shore up the government\u2019s balance sheet.\n\u00a0 Who will have the means to take over the Khazanah assets? If the government does an open tender, there will be no shortage of tycoons who will be interested and who will say they can raise the money by gearing themselves up. After all, some of these companies are profit-making machines so banks will be prepared to provide loans. But for individuals to borrow billions, the question of systemic risk to the banking system will arise. Do we want a repeat of what happened in 1997/98? The better solution, however, is to turn to other GLICs like the EPF and PNB. They have the money and they are in fact also shareholders in some of the Khazanah companies (see Tables 4 and 5). As at Dec 29, 2017, PNB had investments totalling RM198.9 billion on Bursa, including controlling interests in giants like Malayan Banking Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd and S P Setia Bhd. PNB also has shares in Khazanah-controlled GLCs like Axiata, Telekom and CIMB. The EPF is probably the ideal GLICs to buy Khazanah\u2019s assets, if it is the intention of the government for Khazanah to divest. The EPF had RM302 billion invested in quoted equities as at Dec 31, 2017, of which RM158 billion was in domestic equities. It has controlling interests in RHB Bank Bhd, Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd and Malaysia Building Society Bhd (MBSB) with a total value of almost RM14.0 billion (see Table 5). EPF\u2019s total investment assets is almost RM800 billion (see Table 6), making it the largest pool of investment money in the country, and each month, it receives an estimated RM2.0 billion in contributions. That is a whopping RM24 billion a year and EPF needs to continuously look for assets that can generate enough profits for it to pay its contributors dividends of at least 2.0 percentage points above inflation. If indeed the government feels it has no choice but to pare down its debts by selling assets held by Khazanah, the best way to do it would be to sell them tothe \u00a0EPF, which has the money and has been a good money manager. As the EPF is also a big holder of government debt, Malaysian Government Securities or MGS (see Table 6), the sale of, say RM120 billion worth of Khazanah assets can help retire an equivalent amount of MGS. It should be noted, however, that should Khazanah sell its assets, it means that the government will no longer receive the sort of dividends it had been getting and will not benefit from any future increase in value of the GLCs that it sells."}, "29": {"date_posted": "26July2018", "title": "CapitaMalls Malaysia Trust cut to sell at Maybank", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (July 26): Maybank Kim Eng analyst Kevin Wong downgraded the recommendation on Capitaland Malaysia Mall Trust to sell from hold. * Price target (PT) lowered to RM1.10 from RM1.15, implies 11% decrease from last close.

Cars are being snapped up, so much so that certain variants of popular marques like Toyota, Honda and Perodua are out of stock, anecdotal evidence suggests. \u201cMy company has already met its sales target for the full year. We know a lot of bank officers have been working overtime just to process car loans,\u201d says Alvin Chia, manager of P2 Automobile Sdn Bhd, an authorised sales dealer for Perodua. Six banks that The Edge contacted \u2014 Malayan Banking Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, RHB Bank Bhd, Hong Leong Bank Bhd, AmBank Bhd and Affin Bank Bhd \u2014 acknowledge that demand for car financing has indeed shot up since June. All six saw an increase in vehicle financing applications during the month and most of them say their approval rates have also improved. Many, however, do not expect this bumper sales period to provide a major boost to vehicle loan growth this year as they expect demand for cars to cool once the government brings back the Sales and Services Tax (SST) in September.\n\u00a0 What they say RHB\u2019s acting head for group retail banking, Nazri Othman, says applications for vehicle financing in June increased 12% from a month ago and 75% from a year ago. The bank has taken active measures to grow its hire purchase business more aggressively this year. According to Nazri, RHB\u2019s approval rates for such financing improved 5% month on month in June, although credit underwriting remained unchanged. \u201cWe expect our loan growth target for vehicle financing to be between 7% and 9% in 2018 compared with a 5% contraction in 2017. However, we anticipate lower vehicle loan applications in 4Q2018 due to the expected implementation of SST,\u201d he says. Over at Maybank, applications for automotive financing in June increased 9% from a month ago and some 20% from a year ago. \u201cThe approval rates also increased, by 7% in June,\u201d its head for community financial services in Malaysia, Datuk Hamirullah Boorhan, says. Maybank is sticking to its automotive financing growth target of 5.4% for this year, which is similar to last year\u2019s. \u201cWe are not planning to revise our automotive financing growth target at the moment as this could be temporary in nature. We will await the government\u2019s announcement on the SST rate to ascertain its impact on the automotive industry before we consider revising our estimates,\u201d Hamirullah says. At Hong Leong Bank (HLB), applications for vehicle financing in June rose more than 30% from a month ago and more than 50% from a year ago. \u201cHLB\u2019s approval rate has gone up too, largely due to new car sales, which generally have better approval rates. We are expecting a rebound [in vehicle loan growth] in 2018, coming off two years of decline, due to higher-than-normal replacement sales,\u201d says Charles Sik, managing director of personal financial services.\u00a0 At AmBank, car loan application submissions in June increased 15.3% from a month ago. However, submissions were lower than in June last year. A spokesperson for the bank says there was no change in AmBank\u2019s approval rates. \u201cAmBank remains focused on maintaining a strong risk profile, and we conduct our approval process based on specific risk policies and criteria. As part of our digital push, we have also enabled our automotive finance marketing officers and placed mobile application tablets at selected automotive-dealer locations, offering customers the convenience of availing themselves of a loan right at the point of sale.\u201d AmBank does not expect a surge in vehicle financing growth this year. \u201cOur target remains focused on sustaining our current auto finance balances,\u201d the spokesperson says. Affin Bank, meanwhile, saw a \u201cslight\u201d increase in vehicle financing applications in June, both on a month-on-month and year-on-year basis. \u201cApproval rates increased marginally,\u201d says group CEO Kamarul Ariffin Mohd Jamil. He expects vehicle financing growth to remain flat this year as the bank expects \u201ca very slow fourth quarter\u201d following the three-month tax break. CIMB Group has seen \u201cpositive\u201d growth in vehicle loan sales volume over the last two months, thanks to an increase in new car sales and CIMB campaigns, says Vipin Agrawal, the regional head of cards, retail assets and deposits of group consumer banking. \u201cCar loan disbursements have increased by over 30% month on month in June. CIMB\u2019s approval rates have remained steady,\u201d he says. The group believes the recent surge in car sales is a one-off impact of the zero-rated GST. \u201cWe expect higher auto financing volume this year, both due to the zero-rated GST and CIMB campaigns, although we are mindful that this may be moderated by the SST\u2019s introduction later this year,\u201d Vipin says. Meanwhile, Public Bank is widely seen as the market leader in the automotive financing space. Banks that had the highest proportion of automotive loans to their overall loan book as at end-2017 were Affin Bank (28%), AmBank (21%), Public Bank (17%) and Maybank (13%). Margins in the automotive financing space are thin, given the stiff competition out there, which is why some banks choose not to pursue the business aggressively.\u00a0 The non-performing loan ratio for passenger cars is low, at 0.88% as at May.\n\u00a0 No boost to loan growth Analysts wonder if the strong car sales seen in June will stretch over the other two months of the tax holiday, given that popular marques are already out of stock. That is another reason why many are not expecting a boost in vehicle loan growth this year. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have very strong demand but another as to whether the companies actually have the cars to deliver on time. It\u2019s a question of whether the car companies can ramp up their production quickly enough,\u201d says Fiona Leong, a banking analyst at RHB Research. Given that car sales were weak in the last few years, many of the companies have low inventory levels. The number of vehicles sold in Malaysia annually has come down from its peak in 2015. Last year, the number fell 0.6% to 576,635 units and in 2016, it fell 13% to 580,124, based on the Malaysian Automotive Association\u2019s data. In the first five months of this year, vehicle sales stood at 225, 212, a 3.8% drop from the same period a year ago. This weakness was reflected in car loan applications in the banking system. According to Maybank Investment Bank Research, automotive loan applications, on a three-month moving average basis, contracted in May (-3.3%) for the eighth consecutive month due to sluggish sales. Loan approvals contracted 2.9% year on year compared with 3.5% growth in April. \u201cAs a result, the average approval rate was a lower 51% in May versus 55% in April,\u201d the research house says in a recent report. Consumers likely held back from buying cars in May to take advantage of the 0% GST in June. As at end-May, passenger cars accounted for RM159.05 billion or about 9.8% of the banking system\u2019s total loans of RM1.61 trillion.\u00a0 \u00a0"}, "32": {"date_posted": "23July2018", "title": "ViTrox upgraded to buy at Maybank", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (July 23): Maybank Kim Eng analyst Ivan Yap upgraded the recommendation on ViTrox Corp Bhd to buy from hold. * Price target (PT) raised to RM6.50 from RM5, implies 19% increase from last close.

This is good news for Malaysia which, like its regional peers such as Singapore and Thailand, mostly saw small-cap listings in the first half of 2018. The trend of small-cap companies dominating local listings is expected to extend to year end, said Ernst and Young (EY) in its \u201cGlobal IPO trends: Q2 2018\u201d report. This came as geopolitical uncertainty, trade tensions and macroeconomic conditions continue to dampen IPO activity in the year, it said. \u201cThe 1H18 performance does not reflect the IPO activity in Malaysia,\u201d responded a banker, pointing to the historic GE14 which occurred in May. \u201cCompanies coming to the market after May could miss this year\u2019s November window to list,\u201d the banker said.

Also rumoured to list is Malayan Banking Bhd\u2019s insurance and takaful arm Etiqa.

Minus the LEAP Market, Malaysia saw six IPOs in 1H18, including the sole listing so far this year on the Main Market \u2014 Mi Equipment Holdings Bhd. The six companies collectively raised RM358.36 million. Another upcoming listing on the ACE Market is retail technology solutions provider Radiant Globaltech Bhd tomorrow, which raised RM29.5 million from its IPO at 23 sen per share. Meanwhile, Thailand and Singapore saw six and seven listings, respectively, during this period, raising about US$400 million each, according to EY. Note that Malaysia has outperformed Singapore in IPO volumes in recent years, excluding real estate investment trusts and business trusts. Bloomberg data show that between 2014 and 2017 Malaysian IPO proceeds \u2014 excluding the two aforementioned categories \u2014 have beaten Singapore by a healthy margin. Malaysian IPOs raised US$1.655 billion in 2017 compared with US$402 million from Singapore. Despite the lower IPO values for Malaysia year to date (YTD) at US$48 million, Singapore\u2019s YTD volume of US$99 million is low by historical comparisons. Notably, Singapore also did not experience a major macro event such as GE14 in Malaysia. Meanwhile, the LEAP Market has garnered a bit of interest since its first company Cloudaron Group Bhd was listed on Oct 3 last year. The third board now has eight listed companies in the course of less than 12 months of its introduction, raising a collective RM35.23 million. The investment community agreed that with the LEAP Market and other measures by Bursa Malaysia to excite the market, there ought to be a steady stream of small-cap IPOs moving forward. However, of the seven companies which listed on the Main Market and ACE Market up to July 20, 2018, only three firms are seeing their share price currently trading above their IPO price. The change in government partly contributed to the ongoing stock market correction. But this will not cut appetite for big IPOs moving forward, said the banker. \u201cTemporary market correction is normal. IPO depends on whether there is fundamental change,\u201d he said, citing examples such as the ongoing global trade tension. \u201cThat will also weigh differently as different companies have different exposure to these sorts of elements,\u201d he added. But for Areca Capital Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Danny Wong, the local market will still remain attractive to companies eyeing a more defensive market. \u201cOur market seems to be more defensive \u2014 investors are more attracted to companies with dividend payment.

That is the backdrop for central bankers and finance ministers from the Group of 20 (G-20) nations who gather on July 21-22 in Buenos Aires. It is the first meeting of the club that oversees 85% of the world economy since US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on China and the European Union (EU), sparking retaliation (see chart \u2014 Trade Agenda). Financiers and business leaders from G-20 nations have cautioned about the repercussions of increased protectionism ahead of this weekend\u2019s meetings. US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday said trade barriers threaten productivity and wages, while BlackRock Inc boss Larry Fink warned intensifying tensions could spur a broad market downturn. \u201cGlobal growth has reached an inflection and tipping point, with signs that the escalating US-China trade war is starting to disrupt business and investment,\u201d said Chua Hak Bin, senior economist at Maybank Kim Eng Research Pte Ltd in Singapore. That disruption has not yet dented global growth, which is poised to pick up to 3.9% in 2018 \u2014 the fastest expansion in seven years, according to July forecasts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Bigger concern\nThe bigger concern is that tit-for-tat tariffs between the US and its trading partners will gnaw at confidence and eventually hurt business investment and consumer spending. For JPMorgan Chase & Co chief executive officer Jamie Dimon, the tension is so far \u201caffecting psyche more than it is economics,\u201d which can have \u201cunpredictable outcomes.\u201d A trade war has been building for some time. An early warning sign was the March 2017 G-20 meeting in Germany \u2014 the first for US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \u2014 when members dropped from the official communique a pledge to avoid protectionism. Mnuchin said at another gathering a year later that the US was \u201cloud and clear\u201d in its message. Since then, the US has slapped tariffs on US$34 billion (RM138.38 billion) of Chinese imports, with another US$16 billion likely to follow and an additional US$200 billion under consideration. Beijing has retaliated on US$34 billion of US goods, saying it will fight back against any further levies. Separately, the US and the EU are in a tit-for-tat battle over American metal tariffs, while Trump has threatened to erect barriers against European cars. The EU is preparing a new list of American goods to hit with protective measures, according to a person familiar with the move, in case a mission to Washington next week fails to persuade Trump not to raise the car tariffs. The tariffs are hitting supply chains and boosting prices just as some major economies show signs of decelerating. China\u2019s gross domestic product grew at the slowest pace since 2016 in the second quarter. The IMF in its July forecasts cut 2018 growth estimates for the euro area and Japan, cautioning that global output could drop roughly 0.5% below its projected level by 2020 if threatened trade barriers become reality. While the numbers point to modest deceleration, the trade clash with the US has only just begun. Trade bellwether\nSouth Korea, considered a bellwether for global trade, is showing signs of strain. June exports fell 0.1% from a year earlier, compared with a 2.2% gain forecast in a Bloomberg survey, and both the Bank of Korea and finance ministry this month trimmed their growth outlook. The softening in Asian exports is a clear warning sign, said Robert Subbaraman, Singapore-based head of emerging markets economics at Nomura Holdings Inc. Markets do not fully reflect concerns that trade tensions will derail global growth. The US S&P 500 stock index has increased 5.3% this year, while the STOXX Europe 600 Price Index has slipped just 0.5%.

The average KLCI year-end target by research houses of 1,827.50 points indicates a 9.8% potential gain from last Friday\u2019s close of 1,663.86 points. Last Friday, the benchmark index slipped 1.58% or 26.79 points to close at its one-year low of 1,663.86, with about two billion shares worth RM2 billion changing hands. One of the key drivers for the optimism is the defensive nature of the Malaysian stock market compared with the region due to the ample liquidity provided by local institutions. Affin Hwang Investment Bank\u2019s strategy report highlighted the defensiveness of the KLCI during meltdowns, normally aided by Malaysia\u2019s ample domestic liquidity. \u201cBased on our estimates, private and quasi government funds combined accounts for more than RM1.6 trillion, and accounts for 52% of the Malaysian capital market,\u201d it added. Another reason is due to the attractive dividend yield of certain stocks following the heavy selldown seen in the last two months. A favourite among analysts is Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank). Affin Hwang analyst Tan Ei Leen has a \u201cbuy\u201d call for Maybank, with a target price (TP) of RM12 as she views the recent share price correction representing a buying opportunity. Maybank\u2019s recent decline has seen its market capitalisation fall below RM100 billion. But at current level, its dividend yield stands at an attractive level of 6.13%. Based on Bloomberg data and Bursa Malaysia filings, the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) have been accumulating Maybank shares. EPF\u2019s interest in Maybank has increased by 5.2% to 1.37 billion shares or a 12.57% stake compared with its holdings during the first quarter this year. Similarly, PNB has increased its stake to 3.74 billion shares or a 34.2% stake in Maybank recently. Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd also expects banks such as Maybank to benefit from the return of foreign funds when some of the global uncertainties are resolved. Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) is also expected to see a near-term rebound amid the sharp selldown following the announcement by Communications and Multimedia Minister Gobind Singh Deo that fixed line broadband prices will be reduced by 25% by end of the year. The dividend yield for TM has increased to 6.32% from 3.5% in December last year, assuming that the telecommunications company maintains its dividend payout. Nonetheless, not everyone is on the same page when it comes to the telecom sector amid a competitive operating environment. Affin Hwang Capital analyst Isaac Chow said the telecom sector\u2019s lacklustre earnings outlook remains and the risks are still tilted towards downside. The research firm has a \"neutral\" call on TM, noting that it has the capacity to maintain its minimum dividend payout of 18.6 sen per share, or a yield of 5.5% based on its closing price of RM3.40 last Friday. Another stock that has fallen sharply is Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB), which has lost 11.2% of its value since the 14th general election. MIDF Research said in its strategy report that the perceived risk on TNB\u2019s ability to attain a tariff hike and its reasonably high foreign shareholding among index stocks have led to a substantial decline in its share price. \u201cGiven substantial price depreciation in the past month, we see value emerging. Our TP remains unchanged at RM16.30, and our \u2018buy\u2019 call is reaffirmed. Dividend yields are now attractive at 5.3% (positive spread against 10-year MGS [Malaysian government securities] of 4.26%) while valuations are cheap at 11 times FY18 [forecast] earnings, a substantial discount to the market\u2019s 16 times to 17 times,\u201d it said.

With the Indonesian government\u2019s push to make it mandatory for biodiesel to have a bio-content of at least 25% beginning 2019, the consumption of palm oil in the highly populated country is only going to grow, according to TSH group managing director Datuk Tan Aik Sim. Indonesia has planned to increase its biodiesel mandate from its current rate of 20% to 25% from 2019. The B25 could double Indonesia\u2019s consumption of palm oil \u2014 the raw ingredient for fatty acid methyl ester \u2014 to between 5.5 million and six million kilolitres in 2019, according to a news report citing Indonesia\u2019s New and Renewable Energy director Rida Mulyana. This bodes well for TSH\u2019s long-term growth strategy, as the group has strategic land bank in the country suitable for the cultivation of oil palm. \u201cMany are saying that Kalimantan has millions of hectares (ha). But the truth is, Kalimantan has vast land area, but the ones that are strategic for plantation are not easy to come by now. But for TSH, we have the avenue to do it (plant),\u201d said Tan. The group has a total plantation land in Kalimantan and Sumatera in Indonesia and Sabah in Malaysia measuring 99,523ha. A total of 54,232ha are unplanted estates in Indonesia. Of the group\u2019s total hectarage, some 42.3% are planted and spread out with a weighted average age of 8\u00bd years. It operates seven palm oil mills after the latest one in Sumatera started commercial run early this year, with a total production capacity of 2.4 million tonnes and an average utilisation rate of 80%, Tan guided. \u201cWe had bought these land [earlier], with the long-term view of developing it progressively. We plan to plant in line with the [progress of us obtaining the] Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification,\u201d said Tan, adding that the group will speed things up when the market recovers. TSH is unfazed by the near-term pressure on crude palm oil (CPO) prices. In fact, Tan acknowledged that prices could remain under pressure in the near term \u2014 partly due to higher production and negative sentiment resulting from the European Parliament (EP)\u2019s proposed ban on palm oil \u2014 but believes \u201cthere is light at the end of the tunnel\u201d. On June 14, the EP deferred its proposed total ban on palm biofuel to 2030, from the earlier deadline of 2021. The palm biofuel directive was part of the European Union\u2019s goal to increase the use of renewable energy by 2030. \u201cWe do not like the policy. Sustainability is good for the environment, but it is discriminatory against palm oil,\u201d said Tan. \u201cHowever, over the time frame of 12 years [from now], we think the impact is not going to be that significant [on the industry],\u201d he said, adding that the ban will not completely displace demand for palm oil. \u201cThe demand for and consumption of palm oil from other regions \u2014 especially Asia and Africa \u2014 would have grown tremendously by then. We are looking at growing wages and employment numbers, giving rise to higher disposable income, and that has got a strong correlation with the consumption of vegetable oils,\u201d Tan explained. Price-wise, according to Tan, the industry may see a CPO price boom post-2021, as the historical expansion and replanting patterns suggest a decrease in palm oil production in Indonesia and Malaysia by then. This is in line with Rabobank\u2019s research report, which said that producers should make plans to have sufficient palm oil supplies by 2025 to enjoy a bullish palm oil price environment, as the global scene is expected to face a palm oil deficit post-2025. Last Friday, the CPO third month futures ended at RM2,270 per tonne, down 10.45% year-on-year. To date, about 20% of TSH\u2019s plantation land are RSPO-certified. It expects to bring this figure up by another 10% by year end. The group also hopes to maintain an average oil extraction rate of 22% this year, and to sustain FFB production growth, as more of its oil palm trees reach optimum yield besides more planted areas coming into maturity. In the first five months of this year, TSH\u2019s FFB production grew 22% year-on-year. For the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 (1QFY18), TSH turned in a net profit of RM17.83 million, down 39% from RM29.26 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenue stood marginally lower at RM226.14 million during the quarter under review, compared with RM228.50 million in 1QFY17. Eight of the analysts covering TSH have a \u201chold\u201d call on the stock, two with a \u201cbuy\u201d call, and two others rating it a \u201csell\u201d. \u201cGiven TSH\u2019s relatively high net gearing of 94% (as at March 31) post adopting the new MFRS 116 and 141, this will hamper immediate growth potential as TSH will likely focus on managing and reducing its debt level,\u201d analysts of Maybank Investment Bank Research guided in a note dated June 8. At its closing price of RM1.17 last Friday, TSH had a market capitalisation of RM1.6 billion.

Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd head of research Kenny Yee said foreign outflows exceeded RM10 billion during the May-June period, with the post-general election market experiencing net foreign selling of nearly RM7 billion to-date. By comparison, the country recorded net foreign inflow of RM10.25 billion into equities in 2017. \u201cFor this week alone, net selling has touched RM310.7 million (till Thursday) and we reckon these funds may continue to divest in the immediate term,\u201d he told Bernama. Yee said the ongoing trade spat between the US and China was likely to be the main factor contributing to the trend. At Friday\u2019s closing, the FBM KLCI ended sharply lower at 1,663.86 from Thursday\u2019s \u00a01,690.95, a fall of 26.79 points. However, Yee expressed optimism that the \u2018kitchen-sinking\u2019 in the country was merely a short-term pain. He said Malaysia was deemed the region's safe haven, with the market supported by the \"big four\" government-linked investment companies (GLICs), namely the Employees Provident Fund, Permodalan Nasional Bhd, Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) and Lembaga Tabung Haji. \"The total fund size managed by the four GLICs exceeds RM1.2 trillion, not to mention those from sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd and its subsidiary, ValueCAP Sdn Bhd,\" he added. He also believes\u00a0that foreign funds were likely to take advantage of the weak ringgit, which had depreciated to about RM4.04 against the greenback from the year's highest level of RM3.86. \"Index-linked blue chips such as Telekom Malaysia, Maybank, KLK and Genting are now ripe for the picking as they are trading at attractive levels,\" Yee said, adding that investors could re-look at small-cap stocks like Econpile, GFM, Kelington and Mi Equipment when the market liquidity was restored. However, he cautioned that the US remained the epicentre of global equity markets, making a stir on issues pertaining to trade tensions or its interest rate increases. Yee also refuted speculation that the arrest of former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak would affect foreign investors' confidence in the local stock market. Last Wednesday, Najib hit the headlines in local and foreign newspapers as the country\u2019s first ex-prime minister to be charged in court, with three counts of criminal breach of trust and one count of abuse of power in connection with SRC International Sdn Bhd funds totalling RM42 million. Hermana Capital Bhd chief executive officer and chief investment officer Datuk Dr Nazri Khan Adam Khan said global equity sentiment continued to be affected by worries on trade tensions between the world's two largest economies and the possibility of a second round of tariff imposition. \u201cAnytime now, they will be going for the second round of tariff imposition worth US$50 billion,\u201d he said. The US began imposing new tariffs on US$34 billion of Chinese imports on Friday and Beijing retaliated with its own set of tariffs rate on US goods, equalling that of Washington. RHB Banking Group chief economist and head of research Dr Arup Raha said domestic buyers were seen mopping up stocks sold by foreign funds but with little appetite to be overly aggressive. \u201cInvestors will likely stay risk-off with the tightening in monetary conditions globally; hence, emerging market (EM) outflows are not expected to reverse in the near-term,\u201d he said. However, he said, sentiment could be lifted by a de-escalation in the US-China trade conflict, a better explanation on the government\u2019s fiscal options in 2019, decisions on big-ticket infra projects and further clarity on leadership roles at government-linked companies/GLICs as well as government agencies. On the ringgit's performance, Arup said all Asian currencies fell against the greenback over the week despite the broad US Dollar Index being slightly lower over the same period. However, the ringgit actually fared better than most of its peers. \u201cThe ringgit fell 0.19% week-on-week (w-o-w), only behind the Taiwan dollar and the Philippine peso, excluding the Hong Kong dollar which is pegged to the greenback,\u201d he noted. The biggest themes this week were the US-China trade war rhetoric and Chinese yuan movements (-0.64% w-o-w against the dollar), while the overarching driver of tighter US monetary policy continued to exert influence over emerging-market assets, he said. \u201cDespite Malaysia's reliance on trade and its economic ties with China, investors are still sticking with the strong and resilient growth story in Malaysia. \u201cWe also do not see the market pressuring Bank Negara Malaysia to hike rates at this juncture, unlike its neighbour Indonesia,\u201d Arup said. He noted crude oil prices, which were a traditional ringgit driver in the past, appeared to have little impact on the currency this week. \u201cWe forecast the ringgit's performance to be comparable with the rest of the region over the second half of this year, eyeing the 4.10 level (versus the greenback) for end-2018,\u201d he said. Arup said despite weakness in Malaysia's external fundamentals, Malaysia's full-year growth should remain robust while deep domestic liquidity should support the broader market even if foreign investors pared down their holdings. He added the fiscal budget, likely to be tabled in November, would be key to watch, both to gauge the government's ability to stick with its 2.8% deficit target for 2018 and the 2019 plans."}, "51": {"date_posted": "6July2018", "title": "7-Eleven arrives in Vietnam aiming for 100 stores in three years", "article": " (July 6): For decades, Vietnamese have shopped, snacked and hung out at the country\u2019s traditional markets: colorful, chaotic mazes of open air stalls where vendors hawk everything from fruits and vegetables, to sandwiches and sodas to the odd clucking chicken. Seven-Eleven is pushing a different model. The Japanese-owned chain in August opened its first outlet in the country, an air-conditioned, Wi-Fi equipped oasis in downtown Ho Chi Minh City. Since then, it\u2019s rolled out about two locations per month, with plans for 100 within the next three years. GS Retail Co, the giant South Korean mini-mart operator, opened its beachhead in January. Meanwhile, local chains have announced new plans to flood the country with thousands of their own stores. The brewing battle among purveyors of climate-controlled convenience is a measure of how far Vietnam has come since it opened to more trade and investment a decade-and-a-half ago. Factory openings by multinationals like Samsung Electronics Co\u00a0have made Vietnam a manufacturing powerhouse and helped lift average annual incomes to US$2,385 from about US$400 back in 2000. In the first half of 2018 the economy grew 7.1%, its fastest pace in a decade. \u201cI see a domino effect,\u201d said Willy Kruh, a convenience-store watcher who heads KPMG Canada\u2019s global consumer consultancy. \u201cAs other retailers see the success of the foreign players that have come in, it\u2019s only going to bring in more retail, more brands, more big players.\u201d Lured by one of the world\u2019s youngest consumer markets \u2014 more than half of Vietnam\u2019s 93 million people are under 35 \u2014 foreign investors are pouring money into the country.

In November, there was the US$709 million raised by shopping mall operator Vincom Retail JSC. That record stood until April, when Techcombank brought in US$922 million. A month after that, it was luxury property developer Vinhomes JSC raking in US$1.4 billion. \u201cYou now have a young, emerging middle class looking to consume \u2014 and as they do, it\u2019ll invite more and more investment,\u201d said Jeffrey Perlman, head of Southeast Asia at Warburg Pincus, the U.S.-based private equity firm which owns stakes in both Vincom Retail and Techcombank. College student Vo Thi Hoai Ngan fits the target marketing profile. On a recent weekday afternoon in Ho Chi Minh City, she bypassed street vendors selling sugarcane and coconut drinks to buy bottled water at an air-conditioned mini-mart operated by Circle K Stores Inc. \u201cMy classmates and I prefer to come here for a quick meal,\u201d she said. \u201cIt offers free Wi-Fi, chairs and tables.\u201d Circle K, a chain owned by Canada\u2019s Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc, led the way for foreign convenience stores 10 years ago, when it open its first outlet in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\u2019s commercial capital. Tokyo-based FamilyMart UNY Holdings Co followed in 2009. But growth didn\u2019t really take off until 2014, when the economy shrugged off its own mini debt-crisis and got inflation under control. That year, McDonald\u2019s Corp. and Domino\u2019s Pizza Inc. opened their first restaurants in the country. Now a full-scale convenience-store flood is coming. The country\u2019s biggest operator of gas stations, Vietnam National Petroleum Group, plans to add mini-marts at fillings stations across the country and property developer Vingroup JSC says it will add 4,000 mini-grocery stores by 2020. Throughout Asia, where dense cities often make big box retailing impractical, convenience stores are expanding faster than every other type of business selling food and sundries, according to IGD, a grocery market researcher. In Indonesia, which is a few steps ahead of Vietnam on the development curve, Alfamart and Indomaret have been opening 1,000 mini-marts and convenience stores every year. \u201cVietnam is at the start of that journey today,\u201d said Nick Miles, IDG\u2019s head of Asia-Pacific research. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of at that point in per-capita income where modern trade starts to accelerate.\u201d No economist has actually done a formal study of the convenience store as a marker of development. But researchers have shown that consumption evolves in a predictable way as societies get richer. With annual incomes below US$2,000, people buy things like bicycles and basic necessities. Between US$2,000 and US$6,000, where the average Vietnamese person is now, it\u2019s scooters, refrigerators and beer. (Cars, laptops and cosmetics come next.) Tu Vu, head of 7-Eleven\u2019s Vietnam unit, is betting that new shopping trends will include frequent visits to his convenience stores. So far, Seven System Vietnam JSC has 19 franchise outlets in the country, all in Ho Chi Minh City. Vu says he\u2019ll need hundreds of stores to become profitable, an expansion that will take several years. \u201cWe are experiencing a transition from mom-and-pop stores to modern trade,\u201d Vu said. \u201cThis is what Japan went through 40 years ago.

The target is based on 16.5 times the market\u2019s forecast earnings. Based on the FBM KLCI targets by various research outfits, Yee said the forecast for the benchmark index ranged from 1,767 to 1,920, which indicates their positive view compared to the index\u2019s current level. \u201cCorporate earnings growth is expected to continue with 2018 growth forecast at around 6.8% compared with about 7.5% last year.

Yee also said the volatility in the market is one of the causes of the selldown but he expects foreign funds to return as Asia continues to be the engine of growth for the world economy. Amid the uncertainties, Malaysia, which has a lower average market volatility compared with its peers such as Singapore, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia, could be deemed as the region\u2019s safe haven and is likely to attract interest of foreign investors. The domestic market, which has a large participation from local institutions such as the Employees Provident Fund, Permodalan Nasional Bhd, Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan), Lembaga Tabung Haji and others, could help support the market. \u201cMalaysia, a perennial safe haven, should be a top destination for many foreign funds when they eye a return,\u201d he added.

Going forward, however, we are wary that the market has not yet digested a likely earnings step-down in the second regulatory period (RP2).

In its Tuesday strategy note authored by Suhaimi Ilias and Wong Chew Hann, Maybank IB Research said the FBM KLCI target of 1,750 points is based on 15.6 times forward price-earnings-ratio (PER). It also expects range-bound trading for the most of 2H18. On a positive note, the research house said optimism about Budget 2019, and the new government\u2019s commitment to strengthening its finances and stepping up governance, accountability and transparency, will serve as potential catalysts to drive the FBM KLCI higher. \u201cWe would not be surprised at foreign flows turning positive again, after Budget 2019 realistically reassures on the country\u2019s macro growth and addresses the government\u2019s fiscal target. Thereafter, prudent economic management should see long-term investors returning,\u201d it said. Meanwhile, in view of external headwinds and uncertainty over domestic political events, Maybank IB Research also trimmed its 2018 gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for Malaysia to 5.1% from 5.3%. \u201cWe trim our 2018 real GDP growth forecast to +5.1% from +5.3% previously as we adjust the growth forecasts for the supply and demand components of GDP to factor in year-to-date data and the impact of measures announced so far by the new Pakatan Harapan government. \u201cWe see growth moderating further to +4.9% in 2019, given the outlook for slower global economic growth that will affect Malaysia\u2019s external trade growth performance, as well as the implications of the Pakatan government\u2019s policies on the dynamics of domestic demand growth,\u201d Maybank IB Research said. While noting that global economic growth sustained its momentum in 1H18, the global composite purchasing manager\u2019s index has plateaued, signalling \u201ctoppish\u201d economic growth. Maybank IB Research said world economic growth is expected to moderate to 3.9% in 2H18, against a 4% growth in 1H18, and further decelerate to 3.9% in 2019. It noted growing risks and headwinds to global growth in terms of rising interest rates globally, spearheaded by the US Federal Reserve\u2019s ongoing interest rate hikes, compounded by the beginning of the end of the major central banks\u2019 quantitative easing policy. These in turn are causing volatility and corrections in financial markets due to the repricing of growth and policy outlook. \u201cThere are also signs of China\u2019s economy slowing due to the impact of \u2018deleveraging and de-risking\u2019 policy. The global economic outlook is also clouded by the US\u2019 trade tension with China that has spread to other US key trading partners, namely the EU (European Union), Canada and Mexico,\u201d it added. Given these factors, external markets are expected to remain volatile in 2H18 on multiple risk factors and pressure points. Maybank IB Research noted that a full-blown global trade war has not been fully priced in but said that this is not its base case either. \u201cThat said, rhetoric will continue [as a tactic for negotiation] inviting counter-retaliation; these noises will continue to destabilise markets. Beyond the concern about\u00a0 a trade war is the probability of a slower global growth in 2019 due to monetary policy normalisation by the major central banks,\u201d it added.

Some of the nation\u2019s banks, consumer and healthcare shares have now fallen to attractive levels, according to Kenneth Tang, a fund manager at the US$220 billion Japanese investor. Risks over rising interest rates and a global trade war have also been discounted by the recent selling, he added. \u201cCompanies that we have always wanted to own and felt that valuations were the only issue are now coming back in our favor,\u201d Tang said in a recent telephone interview. \u201cThis is a good opportunity to get back into some of these growth proxies.\u201d In a one-two punch for Malaysian investors, Dr Mahathir\u2019s surprise election ignited concern about the country\u2019s fiscal policies just as a resurgent dollar and higher US yields sparked a slump in global emerging markets. The benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index has fallen about 8% since he was sworn in as prime minister on May 10, and foreign investors have withdrawn US$1.8 billion from the market so far this year. The equity gauge closed 0.1% higher in Kuala Lumpur at 1,690.65, extending its two-day gain to 0.6%. Construction stocks have plunged 27% since the election as the government reviews its infrastructure spending. However, like Nikko, others now believe the declines have gone too far.

Nestle Malaysia Bhd is the top performer in the benchmark since the election with a 43% rise and the Bursa Malaysia Consumer Product Index is heading for its best year since 2010. And for Tushar Mohata, the head of Malaysia research at Nomura Holdings Inc, the country\u2019s banks, which account for 34% of the benchmark index, are other obvious beneficiaries of the new government. Public Bank Bhd and Hong Leong Bank Bhd are among consumer-focused firms that will benefit from the uptick in consumption, he said. Still, as the new administration sets its course for reducing government debt and stemming corruption, the uncertainty of whether it will be able to institute reform while meeting fiscal targets is keeping some foreign investors away. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re ready to give the new administration the benefit of the doubt yet,\u201d said Gerald Ambrose, chief executive officer of Aberdeen Standard Investments Malaysia who helps manage about US$3 billion in the country\u2019s equities. \u201cThere are so many unanswered questions.\u201d Lingering Doubts Toward the end of last month, the cost of insuring Malaysian bonds against default soared past that for India and the Philippines, ranked two levels lower by Moody\u2019s Investors Service.

Chinese and South Korean notes are climbing as the rise in protectionism batters their stock markets, drives a flight to safety and, in China\u2019s case, prompts a more dovish monetary policy. Indonesia, India and the Philippines, by contrast, are more removed from the turbulence but are suffering from currency vulnerability due to current-account deficits. The proportion of foreign ownership is the other big differentiator as the simmering tension threatens to boil over into all-out war on July 6, when a deadline for U.S. duties kicks in. China and Korea \u2014 plus Thailand and India \u2014 benefit from a relatively small offshore presence, while Indonesia is at risk. \u201cMarkets with a deep onshore investor base will be better insulated from swings in foreign portfolio flows,\u201d said Jennifer Kusuma, a senior Asia rates strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd\u00a0in Singapore. A relatively benign economic outlook for China, South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia will aid their bonds as investors avoid risk-taking, while Indonesia, India and the Philippines are exposed, she said. Here\u2019s a market-by-market look at how a trade war will affect Asian debt. China Chinese government debt is already benefiting from the trade spat as stocks have fallen into a bear market and a reserve-ratio cut has boosted liquidity. Foreign investors bought the bonds at the fastest pace since September 2016 last month, while the 10-year yield reached a 14-month low of 3.47% on July 2. The notes stand to gain if the People\u2019s Bank of China eases policy further to safeguard growth. Further declines in the yuan are a risk for foreign investors, but the PBOC pledged on Tuesday to keep the currency stable. \u201cAny worsening of the China-U.S. trade spat would be good news for sovereign bonds, as it would pressure the economy and weaken risk appetite,\u201d said Meng Xiangjuan, an analyst at SWS Research Co in Shanghai. \u201cBut as investors already have a very pessimistic outlook on the trade tensions, the room for any sharp declines in yields is limited,\u201d she said, adding that the 10-year yield could drop to as low as 3.40% in the second half. South Korea South Korean sovereign bonds typically benefit from a flight-to-quality in times of stress and the trade war is no exception. Overseas investors pumped a net US$15.8 billion into the notes last quarter, the most in five years, helping push the 10-year yield down six basis points to 2.56%. The country posted a surprise drop in exports in June, a sign the uncertainty may be starting to affect shipments to China. \u201cSouth Korea will be directly hit by a trade war and, should it continue to escalate, it will be difficult for the Bank of Korea to raise interest rates,\u201d said Kong Dongrak, a fixed-income strategist at Daishin Securities Co in Seoul. While Daishin is still forecasting one rate increase in the second half, it\u2019s \u201copen to the possibility of zero BOK hikes this year,\u201d he said. Kong is recommending investors keep buying Korean debt but notes the won, which fell 4.4% against the dollar last quarter, remains a risk. Indonesia Bank Indonesia has raised its policy rate by 100 basis points since mid-May to defend the rupiah, and most analysts are forecasting there will be more hikes. With almost 40% of its bonds owned by global funds, Indonesian debt suffers the most in Asia when foreign money leaves emerging markets. Elevated yields \u2014 the 10-year reached an 18-month high of 7.9% last week \u2014 are making the notes attractive, but the trade war and dollar strength make the global environment a lot less forgiving, said Eugene Leow, a fixed-income strategist at DBS Bank Ltd in Singapore. Yields will probably move \u201csideways\u201d in the second half, Leow said. India India\u2019s policy of not letting much foreign money into its sovereign bond market \u2014 only around 5% of the notes are offshore-owned \u2014 acts as a buffer in times of stress. While the notes haven\u2019t been immune to worsening sentiment pushing down the rupee \u2014 there were US$6.4 billion of outflows from debt last quarter \u2014 the oil price will probably remain the market\u2019s biggest driver. Rupee hits record low as India pays for insatiable oil demand A trade war could result in economic inefficiencies leading to faster inflation that would be bad for bonds, but it could also damp growth, which would be good for debt, said Sandeep Bagla, associate director at Trust Capital Services India Pvt in Mumbai. He forecasts the 10-year yield will fall to 7.25%, from 7.88% on Tuesday, by the end of the year. Thailand Thai bonds have been popular in recent years due to the country\u2019s large current-account surplus and the resilient baht, and managed to attract inflows in June. While a trade war will likely lead to a drop in Thai exports and a narrower excess, the relatively low level of overseas ownership should act as a cushion, said Kobsidthi Silpachai, head of capital market research at Kasikornbank Pcl in Bangkok. Kasikornbank forecasts the Bank of Thailand will stay on hold for the rest of this year and sees the 10-year yield rising to 3% at year-end, from 2.56% on Wednesday. Malaysia A preponderance of hold-until-maturity Islamic investors and the possibility of a dovish shift from the central bank means Malaysian debt may do comparatively well as protectionism rises. Elevated oil prices are also supporting the crude exporter and acting as a buffer for the local currency. Ringgit bonds may be relatively resilient to a trade war as much of the investor base \u2014 Islamic funds and lenders, regional central banks and sovereign wealth funds \u2014 are long-term holders, said Winson Phoon, the head of fixed-income research at Maybank Kim Eng Securities Ltd in Singapore. The 10-year yield, at 4.19% on Wednesday, will probably move in a range of 4% to 4.10% over the next three to six months, he forecast. Philippines The trade dispute will keep the pressure on Philippine government bonds due to the nation\u2019s twin deficits and high inflation, said Arup Ghosh, a senior Asia rates strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore. Foreign interest in the debt remains light amid peso underperformance, issuance pressure and tighter funding costs, said Ghosh, adding he saw upside risks to inflation due to the weakening currency and higher oil prices."}, "61": {"date_posted": "4July2018", "title": "Maybank eyes Islamic finance leadership", "article": " Malayan Banking Bhd\n(July 3, RM8.98)\nMaintain buy with an unchanged fair value (FV) of RM10.70: We maintain our \u201cbuy\u201d call on Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) with an unchanged FV of RM10.70 per share, supported by our financial year ending Dec 31, 2019 (FY19) return on equity forecast of 11.2%, leading to a price-to-book value of 1.5 times.

The group aims to become the global leader in Islamic finance by 2020. MGIB as at the end of FY17 contributed 28.8%, 31% and 26.6% of Maybank Group\u2019s assets, funding and profit before tax (PBT) respectively. MGIB also accounted for 36%, 49% and 37% of Maybank (MBB Domestic) assets, funding and PBT respectively in FY17. In the first quarter of FY18 (1QFY18), Maybank Islamic loans comprised 57.7% of the group\u2019s total loans in Malaysia. MGIB targets to contribute 50%, 50% and 40% of the group\u2019s assets, funding and PBT respectively by 2020. The \u201cIslamic first\u201d strategy saw MGIB\u2019s assets rising, reaching a high of RM202.5 billion in FY17. Total financing and PBT were the highest at RM163.6 billion and RM2.27 billion respectively. It had a strong local market share of 33.6% and 31.2% in 1QFY18 respectively for financing and funding. Management hinted that MGIB\u2019s growth will be organic. MGIB introduced an Islamic World Mastercard, Ikhwan-I, in May 2018. Through this card, 0.2% of spending will be donated to charity, which will eventually be channelled into waqaf and zakat funds. Also, to provide a rent-to-own ownership, a house ownership scheme, Houzkey, has been introduced. We understand that funds from investment accounts could be channelled for the acquisition of assets under this scheme. The bank will be the owner of the property. Customers renting it will be given an option to purchase the property from the bank. The purchase price of the property will be locked in and rental payments could be fixed for up five years. The domestic Islamic banking business is operated under a leverage model. Meanwhile, in Indonesia, it is operated under an Islamic banking window. The leverage model of MBB Domestic, as we understand it, has advantages in terms of operating cost compared with a fully stand-alone operation. This can be observed via MGIB\u2019s low CI ratio of 34.3% in 1QFY18 compared with the group\u2019s 47.6%. The leverage model provides greater clarity on strategic directions, taking its cue from the group\u2019s overall business strategy. MGIB\u2019s net profit margin was lower at 1.88% in 1QFY18, versus the group\u2019s net interest margin of 2.39% on higher funding cost for Islamic banking compared with conventional banking. MGIB\u2019s cost of funding was higher on a lower current and savings account (Casa) ratio of 26% (Maybank Group\u2019s Casa ratio: 35.3%). The bulk of the group\u2019s customers still hold conventional deposits. Management is addressing this shortcoming for Islamic banking and hopes to improve MGIB\u2019s funding cost moving forward. In 2016, Islamic financing only covered 3.4% of total trade globally, compared with 96.6% by conventional trade financing facilities. Bank Negara Malaysia targets to raise this to 10% by 2019. This opens up opportunities for growth in Islamic trade financing to support exports of halal products internationally. Other priorities for Islamic banking in 2018 would be to diversify the underlying assets of its unrestricted investment accounts, grow its wealth management business and to develop the Islamic capital market. Management also plans to develop distribution capabilities for the issuance of sukuk, syndicated financing and trade financing. The group has announced the cancellation of its 16th dividend reinvestment plan on the electable portion of the final dividend for FY17 on softer market conditions. The final dividend for FY17 of 32 sen will be fully paid out to shareholders in cash on July 6, 2018. \u2014 AmInvestment Bank, July 3 \u00a0"}, "62": {"date_posted": "3July2018", "title": "The Week Ahead: Awaiting Cabinet line-up and new Umno president", "article": " THE ringgit, which last week breached the psychological RM4 mark against the US dollar for the first time in five months, is in the spotlight again.

It added that home mortgages still led the way with an 8.9% year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in April 2018, contributing 33.1% of loans to the banking system, indicating a steady demand for housing and the associated. Meanwhile, it said aviation related stocks such as AirAsia Group Bhd and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) experienced the second and fourth highest inflow of RM449 million and RM330.2 million respectively during the period under review, especially with MAHB's inclusion in the FBMKLCI index in mid-June and AirAsia in the index's reserve list. Commenting on the banking sector, the research house said such prevailing environment has bode well for property developers such as S P Setia Bhd, which saw a net foreign inflow of RM148.4 million during the same period under review. It said loan growth is expected to be better at +6% y-o-y in 2018 versus 2017 level based on current of loans applied and approvals which will provide a steady loans pipeline.

Among glove players, Top Glove Corp Bhd recorded the highest net foreign inflow among the major glove players worth RM207 million between January 2018 and mid-June 2018, with strong demand from Asian emerging markets, Eastern Europe and Latin America. MIDF Research said Genting Bhd recorded a net inflow of RM332.1 million between January 2018 and mid-June 2018, buoyed by improving non-core businesses such as power and O&G. On the other end of the spectrum, the largest outflow during the period was seen in utilities stock Tenaga Nasional Bhd, amounting to RM2.6 billion.

In total, MIDF Research said in spite of the recent trend of foreign selling, Malaysia still recorded the highest cumulative inflow since January 2017 in the region. This is compared with the other three Southeast Asian markets the research firm tracks, namely the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia. The research firm said there has been RM4.21 billion, or US$826.6 million, net of cumulative inflow into Malaysian equities since January 2017.

Since then, the banking group has fallen below the RM100 billion level a couple of times and was last seen to be trading below RM100 billion market capitalisation in mid-December last year. The decline was in line with the rest of the emerging markets as foreign investors sought to reduce their exposure amid escalating trade tensions seen between the US and other major economies including China and the European Union. Coupled with some of the domestic uncertainties following the change of government for the first time in Malaysia\u2019s history on May 9, as well as the re-emergence of news involving the banking group\u2019s exposure to Singapore\u2019s Hyflux Ltd, Maybank shares have been on a downward trend since they touched an all-time closing high of RM10.53 on May 21. It has fallen by 17.6% since then. An analyst told The Edge Financial Daily that the decline was also partly due to the weakening of the ringgit, which continued to weigh on banks\u2019 revenues and the month-old news relating to the banking group\u2019s exposure to Hyflux. To recap, Hyflux on May 22 applied for court protection to facilitate restructuring of some of its S$1.5 billion (RM4.4 billion) in outstanding debt. In 2013, Maybank agreed to provide an 18-year S$720 million financing facility to the Hyflux project called Tuaspring, which is a desalination and electricity generation plant in Singapore. \u201cThe selldown might be related to the month-old news relating to Maybank\u2019s exposure to Hyflux. But again, a weakening ringgit could also contribute as it is negative to the banking sector,\u201d the analyst said. Nevertheless, Maybank, which is ranked as one of the top five banks in Southeast Asia, is not the only banking stock that has seen a decline in its share price. All the five banking stocks in the FBM KLCI index have seen a total of RM9.3 billion market capitalisation wiped off this week.

Goldman\u2019s not quite ready to bail out completely, however \u2014 its target implies gains of about 14% from current levels. Meanwhile, strategists at UBS Group AG see Asian stock markets pricing in a one-in-five chance of a more serious trade war causing an earnings recession. A full-fledged trade war could see stocks in Asia tumble 30% from this year\u2019s peak, they said. Hong Kong Don\u2019t count on a rebound in Hong Kong stocks any time soon either, according to strategists at Morgan Stanley, who slashed their 12-month target for the Hang Seng Index by about 10% this week. The new forecast implies a slump of 18% from the gauge\u2019s January peak, nearing the 20% correction commonly associated with a bear market. \u201cThe Hang Seng Index is at risk of a further sharp drawdown near term,\u201d Morgan Stanley strategists led by Jonathan Garner wrote in a note Wednesday. Hong Kong is especially vulnerable to volatility in the U.S. and China given that its currency is pegged to the dollar and therefore tied to U.S. monetary policy, while many of its companies depend on China for their earnings. China The outlook is no better in China, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index headed into a bear market with losses from its January peak at 20%. The index is at its lowest since June 2016 and is one of the world\u2019s worst performers this year, coinciding with Beijing\u2019s deleveraging campaign. Morgan Stanley strategists now forecast the CSI 300 Index to fall into a bear market that will last for the next year. Alongside the standard emerging-market and trade-war pessimism, deteriorating liquidity conditions in China and a weaker yuan will also weigh on stocks, they said. CICC, meanwhile, slashed its year-end estimate for the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index to 14,000 from 16,000, as company multiples are unlikely to expand as much as previously thought, due to tighter liquidity conditions both at home and globally. Philippines Asia\u2019s worst-performing equity index this year, which entered a bear market Thursday, after a 22% drop from its January peak, won\u2019t be able to pull out of its own swoon unless the Philippine central bank does more to help the stock market recover, according to the nation\u2019s biggest money manager. Fritz Ocampo, who manages about US$19 billion as chief investment officer of BDO Unibank Inc in Makati, said the central bank\u2019s second interest rate hike this year isn\u2019t enough to fully arrest the peso\u2019s slide. \u201cWe may have not seen the bottom yet,\u201d Ocampo said. Malaysia Meanwhile, a stunning May election that ended six decades of rule by the same party has led to even more selling in Malaysia, with stocks plunging for a 10th straight day. Investors adjusting to a new prime minister seeking to shore up the nation\u2019s debt have fled the market, while analysts have cut earnings forecasts so much that Malaysia has overtaken South Korea as the Asia Pacific market with the biggest downgrades in profit projections this year. \u201cThe short-term outlook for Malaysian equities will remain tough, as the new government is trying to find out the depth of the financial issues,\u201d said Christopher Wong, senior investment manager for Standard Life Investments in Singapore. What\u2019s Next? While the bears are plenty, Maybank Kim Eng strikes a more optimistic tone. Investors should look beyond the short-term noise and focus on the region\u2019s long-term growth prospects, John Chong, head of the investment-banking arm of Maybank said at its Invest Asia U.K. conference in London. \u201cAsia is now better positioned to weather the volatility,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe investors will see real value emerging in Asian corporates, after the recent market tantrums and should capitalize on the opportunity.\u201d"}, "77": {"date_posted": "20June2018", "title": "BIMB to restructure once dust settles at Tabung Haji", "article": " BIMB Holdings Bhd will likely embark on a group restructuring next year at the earliest as it waits for the dust to settle at Lembaga Tabung Haji (TH) where there is currently a boardroom shake-up, sources say. TH is its biggest shareholder with a 53.47% stake, followed by the Employees Provident Fund (12.75%) So far, four of TH\u2019s 10-member board, including chairman Datuk Seri Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahman, have resigned since the change of government after Pakatan Harapan\u2019s historic win in the 14th general election. The other three are Tan Sri Mohamed Apandi Ali, the country\u2019s former attorney-general; Tan Sri Mohd Irwan Serigar Abdullah, the former Treasury secretary-general; and Datuk Rosni Sohar, a politician. BIMB, a financial holding company (FHC), has long been mulling a group restructuring that basically involves its wholly owned banking entity, Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd, taking over its listing status on Bursa Malaysia. Apart from the bank, BIMB owns 59.64% of listed Islamic insurer Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Bhd (STMB) and all of stockbroking firm BIMB Securities Sdn Bhd. \u201cYes, BIMB needs to collapse [the FHC] structure. It\u2019s not something that will happen this year but maybe next year. There are changes happening on the [TH] board and new people will come in, so BIMB has to wait for things to settle [before pursuing the restructuring issue],\u201d says a source familiar with the matter. The source adds that BIMB no longer has plans to sell or trim its stakes in STMB and BIMB Securities as part of the possible restructuring. The group had considered those possibilities about a year ago. At that time, it was open to a strategic shareholder taking a stake in BIMB Securities. The move to keep its almost 60% stake in STMB makes sense considering that the insurer has been an increasingly strong profit contributor to the group. It accounted for about 31% of the group\u2019s profit before tax and zakat of RM273.6 million in the first quarter of FY2018. STMB is a major provider of non-interest income for the group. BIMB Securities, however, made a pre-tax loss of about RM200,000 in the first quarter. \u201cWe are of the view that it would be best for [STMB] to be transferred and parked under Bank Islam, given its strong contributions to the group. Without the restructuring, BIMB, as a FHC, will need to meet capital requirements by 2019,\u201d says DBS Group Research in a March 7 report on BIMB. It is understood that capital adequacy rules for banks under Basel III will extend to FHCs in 2019. In the last two to three years, banking groups such as RHB, Affin and Alliance have collapsed their FHC structure. Others like AMMB Holdings Bhd and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd have maintained their FHC structure. BIMB\u2019s potential restructuring, and concerns over how it might be done, may have been one of the reasons for the stock\u2019s underperformance in recent times, says an analyst. But BIMB\u2019s stock is currently among analysts\u2019 top banking picks following its strong financial results for the first quarter of 2018 that were released two weeks ago. Its 1Q2018 net profit, at RM172.1 million, was above analysts\u2019 expectations, coming in at 26.2% of consensus\u2019 full-year forecast. The profit was higher by 14% year on year and by 15% quarter on quarter. BIMB\u2019s after-tax return on equity, at 15.2%, was one of the highest among local banking groups. \u201cWe believe BIMB\u2019s valuations are unduly unappreciated, given its robust financial metrics. Where it may fall short is the liquidity of its stock, given the high and tight holdings of its major shareholders. BIMB could prove sceptics wrong if its financing growth is sustained above that of the industry,\u201d says DBS Group Research in a report after the 1Q results. The 1Q earnings were driven by strong net interest income growth (8.6% year on year) as a result of above-industry financing growth of 6.8%, coupled with a three-basis-point increase in net interest margin from the last overnight policy rate hike. There was also commendable takaful revenue growth of 9.8% and fee income growth of 16%. Allowance for impairment of financial assets stood at RM21.2 million in 1Q2018 compared with just RM8.8 million a year ago. Analysts are unperturbed by the higher provisions at the group as this is seen as a normalisation following the low base last year when it benefited from lumpy writebacks. Credit cost, going forward, should stay at around 20 basis points, DBS Group Research says. Asset quality stayed strong, as reflected by the low gross impaired financing ratio of 0.99%. About 76% of its gross financing of RM43.14 billion as at March 31 is to the household sector. Home financing and personal financing (PF) accounted for the bulk of its consumer financing, at RM17.29 billion and RM12.77 billion respectively. Some analysts say its loans to civil servants could be at risk if government agencies were to downsize their staff in the near future. It is understood that at least 50% of its PF is to civil servants. It is much less in the home financing segment. Nevertheless, the earlier source says that even if it were to happen, it isn\u2019t expected to have a material impact on the group. \u201cManagement has indicated that civil servants PF composition is not affected by the new government\u2019s recent move to not renew the contracts of 17,000 workers \u2014 the group\u2019s civil servant loan portfolio consists of permanent staff, where risk of layoff is lower,\u201d says UOB Kay Hian Research in a recent report. The bank\u2019s PF to civil servants is done via package financing, whereby monthly repayment is made via salary deductions or transfers, which is deemed relatively safe. Bloomberg data shows that of nine analysts who track the stock, eight have a positive call on it and one a \u201chold\u201d. Their average 12-month target price is RM4.85, which indicates more upside from its closing price of RM4.05 last Thursday. The stock has shed 7.9% so far this year. \u201cDespite the strong 1Q2018 results, we maintain our \u2018hold\u2019 call on BIMB as we believe that Permodalan Nasional Bhd\u2019s plan to introduce Islamic shares for Malayan Banking Bhd could cause some investors to switch out of BIMB, which is currently the only shariah-compliant listed bank in Malaysia,\u201d says CIMB Research in a May 30 report.\n\u00a0"}, "78": {"date_posted": "20June2018", "title": "Sime Darby upgraded to hold at Maybank", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (June 20): Maybank Kim Eng analyst Ivan Yap upgraded the recommendation on Sime Darby Bhd to hold from sell. * Price target (PT) set to RM2.45, implies 0% from last close.

A compilation by The Edge shows that following a post-election stock market meltdown, the value of EPF\u2019s investment in the 10 companies has declined dramatically from RM51.21 billion to RM45.12 billion within a month (see table). The top 10 worst performing stocks in EPF\u2019s portfolio in the past one month are Cahya Mata Sarawak Bhd (CMS), Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB), IJM Corp Bhd, Gamuda Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), Axiata Group Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) and Genting Plantations Bhd. The construction sector is the worst hit due to the new Pakatan Harapan (PH) government\u2019s reviews on mega infrastructure projects, namely the East Coast Rail Line (ECRL), the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail (HSR) project and the third mass rapid transit line (MRT3). CMS topped the list in terms of the quantum of the fall in share price. The diversified group\u2019s share price has tumbled 37%, wiping off RM1.7 billion from its market capitalisation. As a result, EPF, which has a 10.69% stake in the company, saw its value of investment drop by RM180 million. Both MRCB and IJM saw their share prices fall 32%, wiping off RM1.4 billion and RM3.1 billion from their market cap respectively. Consequently, EPF, which has a 35.32% stake in MRCB, saw its investment value shrink by RM490 million. Meanwhile, its 14.5% stake value in IJM also dropped by RM450 million. Gamuda\u2019s shares have declined 28%, wiping off RM3.7 billion from its market cap. Hence, EPF\u2019s 10.11% stake value also dropped by RM370 million. While construction stocks are the top losers in the selling wave post-election, the two banking stocks and two telcos, namely Maybank, CIMB, TM and Axiata, have actually caused EPF\u2019s investment value in PLCs to shrink even more. In total, EPF has lost RM3.86 billion in investment value in the four government-linked companies (GLCs) within a month. As the share prices of Maybank, Axiata, CIMB and TM have declined 7%, 12%, 8% and 21% respectively since GE14, EPF\u2019s loss in value on paper from these companies are RM1.06 billion, RM990 million, RM730 million and RM690 million respectively. But it was the decline in the share price of TNB that hurt EPF\u2019s investment value the most. The utility giant saw RM8.5 billion wiped out from its market cap. As a result, EPF, which has a 12.67% stake in the company, saw its investment value shrink 9% or RM1.08 billion. EPF\u2019s equity investment value of RM338.72 billion in the first quarter of this year represents 41.6% of its total asset portfolio of RM814.38 billion. Equities remain the single largest asset class for EPF. A check on EPF\u2019s website shows that the provident fund\u2019s equity investment value contracted from RM344.35 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 to RM338.72 billion in the first quarter this year. This represents a drop of 1.6% or RM5.63 billion.\n\u00a0 Biting the bullet In a bid to control the country\u2019s debt load in excess of RM1 trillion, the government has scrapped the MRT3 and HSR projects, at least for now, while the ECRL is still being reviewed. The MMC Corp Bhd-Gamuda-George Kent (M) Bhd joint venture was widely seen as the strongest contender to undertake the MRT3 project before it was cancelled. Gamuda is hoping that the project will be revived as the Circle Line will integrate the existing public rail services in the Klang Valley. MRT3 is the final alignment of the MRT series of urban rail networks. It was supposed to link with MRT1 \u2014 running from Sungai Buloh to Kajang \u2014 and MRT2 (from Sungai Buloh to Putrajaya), whose construction is ongoing. It is worth noting that negotiations on the HSR project delivery partner agreement with the government were also suspended late last month. In April, the MRCB-Gamuda consortium had been selected for the northern portion of the HSR project alignment while another consortium \u2014 Syarikat Pembenaan Yeoh Tiong Lay Sdn Bhd-TH Properties Sdn Bhd \u2014 had been picked for the southern part. CMS\u2019 shares have also taken a beating due to negative market sentiment towards stocks that are seen as politically linked to the previous Barisan Nasional government. CMS\u2019 biggest exposure is the Pan Borneo Highway and federal road maintenance jobs covering about 200km. There has been suggestion that state road concessions in Sarawak be awarded via open tender. CMS, which has been listed since 1989, is perceived to be controlled by Sarawak Yang di-Pertua Negeri Tun Abdul Taib Mahmud\u2019s family, whose members have been on the board for decades. Construction giant IJM, which is also involved in the toll concession business, suffered a double whammy as the new PH government plans to abolish toll in stages.

The Fed raised its benchmark overnight lending rate a quarter of percentage point to a range of 1.75% to 2%, as expected, on the back of strong US economic growth. Fed policy makers projected two additional increases by the end of this year compared to one previously, based on board member's median forecast. \"We believe a rate hike in September is very likely given the hawkish forecasts,\" said Qi Gao, FX strategist at Scotiabank. \"We remain bearish on the high-yielding INR and IDR as well as the PHP with twin deficits,\" he said. The South Korean won was the biggest loser among Asian currencies, shedding about 0.5% on Thursday. South Korea's vice finance minister said the government is prepared for policy responses against any adverse impact from the Fed's rate rise and that capital outflows shouldn't be too big a concern just because of changes in interest rates. In a surprise for markets, the Chinese central bank resisted following in the Fed's path, leaving its borrowing costs for interbank loans unchanged. That decision came as China reported weaker-than-expected activity data for May that showed the economy is finally slowing under the weight of a prolonged crackdown on riskier lending. \"The pause in rate hike against the backdrop of rising default risk signals two things to us. First, the PBoC is likely to return to neutral stance to safeguard the bottom line of no financial risk after the recent data showed that structural de-leverage has taken effect,\" said Tommy Xie, economist at OCBC bank in a note. \"Second, there is no urgency for China to maintain its favorable yield differential against the US as capital outflow and currency stability is no longer the key concern for China at the moment.\" The Philippine peso eased 0.1% on concerns over high inflation, current account deficits and foreign outflows. The Thai baht also inched lower on the day. On the other hand, the Malaysian ringgit rose 0.2%, after declines in the previous two sessions. Investors were also watching out for the European Central Bank policy meeting on Thursday, in which policy makers could signal their intentions to start unwinding the ECB's massive bond purchasing programme. Analysts say a hawkish tone by the ECB would hurt regional currencies more than the Fed's decision. \"There is much less clarity on the ECB and thus more upside to the EUR,\" said Saktiandi Supaat, head of FX research at Maybank in Singapore, in a report.

Its net profit for the quarter ended March 31 (1QFY2018) fell 68.31% year on year to RM4.1 million as revenue slipped nearly 27% to RM121.24 million. Note that the bottom-line figure includes RM3.88 million booked as other income plus RM3.52 million recorded as fair value gain on biological assets. Adjusted for the latter, the company\u2019s profit falls further to about RM580,000. Its borrowings are proving to be a major drag on TH Plantations\u2019 margins. As at March 31, its gearing ratio stood at 0.7 times. The strain of servicing its debt nearly wiped out the company\u2019s operating cash flow in 1QFY2018 amid lower revenue, its cash flow statement shows. Long-term borrowings constitute the bulk of the company\u2019s debt at RM1.19 billion. It has another RM45.24 million in short-term borrowings. Despite a 14% growth in the planter\u2019s output of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) \u2014 its fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year increase \u2014 poor CPO prices led to operating cash flow falling 80.84% year on year to RM10.65 million in 1QFY2018. At the same time, it paid RM14.11 million in finance costs for the quarter. Capital expenditure and loan repayments, among others, saw TH Plantations get through RM34.54 million cash in 1QFY2018. As at March 31, its cash and cash equivalents stood at RM64.7 million. During the quarter, TH Plantations clocked in a CPO average selling price (ASP) of RM2,355 per tonne, according to Maybank Research, versus an all-in production cost of RM2,248 per tonne. With a high cost base, the company\u2019s margins could remain under pressure in the near term as CPO prices have weakened further to date. Malaysian Palm Oil Board data shows that CPO prices averaged RM2,418 per tonne in April, the lowest monthly average so far this year. While the data for May average prices is not final yet, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that it could dip below the April average. When contacted, a company official points out that operationally, TH Plantations is doing fine as FFB production is rising. \u201cBut CPO prices have been quite weak recently and that\u2019s tough for plantation companies, especially for us as we are a pure upstream player,\u201d says the executive who declined to be identified. The 14% uptick in FFB production during the quarter is encouraging as 1Q is historically the company\u2019s weakest quarter in respect of output. Further output growth could benefit TH Plantations if CPO prices improve going forward. Leading vegetable oils analyst Dorab Mistry reportedly forecast CPO prices to range between RM2,500 and RM2,700 this year. However, production growth is a double-edged sword as any ASP deterioration will hurt TH Plantations\u2019 bottom line. \u00a0 Degearing hitches Weaker CPO prices are hitting the company\u2019s margins amid a debt rationalisation exercise that involves the disposal of non-core assets in order to raise cash and repay debt.

At the time, the target was to reduce gearing to 0.5 times from 0.72 times then by selling two of the non-core assets by end-2017. A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that to achieve the targeted reduction, borrowings would have to be slashed by RM400 million. However, the plan seems to have run into trouble as the company did not announce any asset sales in 2017, likely due to the difficulty in finding ready buyers for vast tracts of plantation land. TH Plantations\u2019 last asset disposal was in 2016 when it sold THP Gemas Sdn Bhd for a one-off gain of RM112.58 million. In theory, TH Plantations could turn to its shareholders for cash to pare down its borrowings, for example via a rights issue. However, the hurdle to such a proposal is tight liquidity as pilgrims fund Lembaga Tabung Haji owns 73.8% of the planter while the Employees Provident Fund holds about 6.9%. In December 2017, TH Plantations\u2019 board gave its approval to sell the company\u2019s investment in Ladang Jati Keningau Sdn Bhd, which carries a net book value of RM30.08 million based on its latest annual report. The lease on the 1,550ha estate expires in 2078. \u201cEfforts to sell the asset have commenced, and a sale is expected to be completed within 12 months of the approval date,\u201d TH Plantations says in its 1QFY2018 release. The company owns 101,000ha across Malaysia and Kalimantan, Indonesia, of which 60,350ha are planted with oil palm. It also has six palm oil mills with a combined capacity of 240 tonnes per hour. Last Friday, the stock closed at 64 sen, down 40.7% from its one-year high of RM1.08. On May 31, Maybank Research cut its target price for the stock from RM1.22 to 89 sen while UOB Kay Hian trimmed its target price from 77 sen to 60 sen after lowering its price-earnings ratio assumption for 2019 from 18 times to 15 times.

In the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, Ta Ann\u2019s cash and cash equivalents fell from RM272.86 million to RM179.85 million, equivalent to 37.2% of its current liabilities. The 0.37 cash ratio is the company\u2019s lowest on a quarterly basis since 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its cash and cash equivalents had fallen on a q-o-q basis in four of the last five quarters. Ta Ann\u2019s cash balance was last seen below RM200 million at end-2012. In contrast, its total current liabilities amounted to RM483.82 million as at March 31, of which RM355.55 million were short-term borrowings. According to Ta Ann\u2019s 1QFY2018 financial statement, its operating cash flow was hit by a double whammy \u2014 its timber division remained loss-making for the third consecutive quarter and plantation earnings dropped 78% y-o-y. The plantation segment, in particular, was hit by a combination of low fresh fruit bunches (FFB) output due to weather changes and low average selling prices (ASPs) for crude palm oil (CPO). In the quarter, the company\u2019s net profit fell 88.4% y-o-y to RM4.23 million as revenue fell 29.7% to RM214.86 million. It declared a 5 sen interim dividend payable on June 29.Notably, net cash generated from operating activities fell 92.2% y-o-y to RM4.17 million. In the same quarter, Ta Ann also completed the acquisition of the 30.4% stake in SPLB for RM170.97 million cash to emerge as the single largest shareholder. It was a related-party deal as the stake was sold by Cermat Ceria Sdn Bhd, a company controlled by Ta Ann\u2019s executive chairman, Datuk Amar Abdul Hamed Sepawi. Note that Abdul Hamed is also SPLB\u2019s executive chairman. In the quarter ended March 31, Ta Ann recorded a RM170.97 million cash payment to acquire SPLB and it also raised RM85.38 million in new borrowings to fund the acquisition. To recap, when Ta Ann announced the proposed acquisition on Jan 11, it said that the deal fits into its expansion plans in Sarawak as it would provide access to SPLB\u2019s future production. However, some analysts noted that the investment would take a while to yield returns due to SPLB\u2019s underperforming estates while added finance costs to acquire the stake could offset the extra income recognition. SPLB has a land bank of 48,086ha in Sarawak, 34,837ha (72.45%) of which are planted. Its palm oil age profile is relatively young with 50% prime mature and 41% immature and young mature. It owns and operates two palm oil mills with a total operating capacity of 150 tonnes per hour. \u00a0 Cash flow pressure If the operating cash flow weakness in the first quarter persists, Ta Ann\u2019s cash reserves could dwindle further given its short-term liabilities, among others. That said, a company official who declined to be named says conditions have been improving in the second quarter thus far and the company expects to play catch-up throughout the rest of the year. \u201cIt rained heavily in end-January and throughout February ... almost everyone in the industry in Sarawak is facing the same problems \u2014 weather issues, rising cost of production and so on,\u201d the official says. To be fair, the RM170.97 million cash acquisition and the RM85.38 million financing raised are one-off occurrences. However, its free cash flow \u2014 a measure of available cash net of capital expenditure requirements \u2014 was in negative territory in 1QFY2018 for the first time since 2012, according to Bloomberg data. According to its cash flow statement, in 1QFY2018, Ta Ann spent RM6.37 million on plantation development and RM7.21 million to acquire property, plant and equipment. The company also paid a combined RM9.08 million in financing-related payments and dividends to non-controlling interests. Ta Ann\u2019s 1QFY2018 earnings surprised analysts on the downside, with its core net profit only making up 4% of full-year consensus estimates, Kenanga Research said on May 25. Its main earnings driver, the plantation business, was hit by wet weather that exacerbated a typically weak quarter while its timber segment remained a drag on earnings. The plantation segment was \u201cweighed down by (lower sales volumes of) CPO (-13% y-o-y) and FFB (-11% y-o-y) due to wet weather in Sarawak that led to higher production cost\u201d, says Kenanga Research. \u201cThis was further dampened by weakened CPO prices at RM2,383 per metric tonne (-19% y-o-y).\u201d The company\u2019s ASP could remain under pressure in 2QFY2018 as CPO prices for April and May have been trending downwards compared with the first three months of the year, according to data from the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. The plantation segment accounted for over 64% of total turnover and nearly all net profit in FY2017. The segment recorded a RM9.59 million pre-tax profit in 1QFY2018, down 78.3% y-o-y as revenue slipped 28%. Following the results announcement, MIDF Amanah Investment Bank downgraded Ta Ann to a \u201csell\u201d. Affin Hwang Capital downgraded the stock to \u201chold\u201d, cutting its target price from RM4.25 to RM2.82. The other seven research houses tracking the stock maintained their calls. At the time of writing, there were three \u201cbuy\u201d ratings, five \u201chold\u201d and one \u201csell\u201d. \u00a0 \u2018Cash flow to improve\u2019 Last Thursday, Ta Ann closed at RM2.80 per share, down approximately 23.5% year to date. In comparison, analyst target prices range from RM2.35 to RM3.60 with a consensus target price of RM2.99. In an email response to The Edge, Affin Hwang said its steep target price cut reflects a lower earnings forecast. It also applied a 30% discount to Ta Ann compared with similar mid-sized planters. \u201cWe believe the environment will continue to be challenging for the timber side. Hence, we downgrade Ta Ann to a \u2018hold\u2019 rating,\u201d Affin Hwang said. In 1QFY2018, Ta Ann\u2019s timber segment posted a pre-tax loss of RM7.17 million compared with a quarterly pre-tax profit of RM13 million the year before. Maybank Research noted on May 25 that this is the segment\u2019s third consecutive sequential loss since the Sarawak government slashed the export log quota from 30% to 20% on July 1, 2017. Effective from the same date, hill timber charges were raised from 80 sen to RM50 per cubic metre, the first revision in three decades. For the full year, Affin Hwang expects the timber segment to remain in the red due to higher production costs and lower log output. \u201cFor it to break even (or turn profitable), we believe plywood prices need to be higher significantly to offset the decline in sales volume,\u201d Affin Hwang tells The Edge. That said, Affin Hwang expects Ta Ann to see a higher CPO output for the full year despite the 1QFY2018 stumble. It expects the company to book an ASP range of RM2,500 to RM2,600 per metric tonne. While lower than the FY2017 ASP of RM2,741 per metric tonne, that forecast remains higher than in 1QFY2018. \u201cWe do expect cash flow to improve as the plantation division\u2019s profit is expected to improve,\u201d says Affin Hwang. \u00a0"}, "88": {"date_posted": "13June2018", "title": "Inari\u2019s new plants seen to boost earnings", "article": " Inari Amertron Bhd\n(June 12, RM2.26)\nMaintain buy with a higher target price of RM2.80: We are positive about Inari Amertron Bhd\u2019s aggressive floor space expansion to 1.35 million sq ft (120,000 sq m) [+34%] by end 2018. For this, we now impute job win assumption for P21 and P34 worth RM150 million and RM300 million for financial year 2019 (FY19) and FY20, ending June. We also raise radio frequency volumes in P13B-2 for the push for 5G cellular networks in 2019. These translate into a 10%/20% increase in our earnings forecasts. From 1.01 million sq ft floor space currently, Inari plans to expand it to 1.35 million (+34%) by end 2018 with the completion of P13B-2 (120,000 sq ft) and P34-1 (220,000 sq ft). Into 2019, further expansion at P34 (P34-2 and P34-3, likely by mid-2019) and consolidation of P8 and Para\u00f1aque operations to P13B2 and CK2 respectively should lift floor space to 1.68 million sq ft. We now assume that Inari will secure additional job wins of RM150 million/RM300 million for FY19/FY20 underpinned by: i) new components outsourcing by Osram at P21 (for example mini light-emitting diode [LED], health sensor, replacement of infrared LED with vertical cavity surface-emitting laser \u2014 these should bring P21 floor space utilisation to 90% to 100% by end 2018); and ii) aggressive floor space expansion of P34. We do not rule out further outsourcing from Osram especially since it has commissioned the first phase of its wafer fabrication in Kulim, which will see more back-end semiconductor jobs being dished out in the future. On largely unchanged forecasts post third quarter of FY18, ending March, results briefing where Inari\u2019s expansion plans were conveyed, we believe that consensus has yet to price in Inari\u2019s aggressive floor space expansion.

Corporate earnings have been rather disappointing for the first quarter of 2018, with most companies missing expectations. Their performance is the main factor that drives the market. The unexciting corporate results will not augur well for the local bourse, at least in the next few months, amid a lack of fresh catalysts. The numbers were down across most sectors, with only the banking sector seeing good performance in terms of profit growth. The improved earnings by the banks were due to lower provisions for non-performing loans. Malayan Banking Bhd achieved 9.7% year-on-year growth in its net profit to RM1.87 billion in the first quarter ended March 31. Revenue rose 2.1% to RM11.52 billion. Maybank attributed the improvement to higher net interest income and Islamic banking income. Hong Leong Bank Bhd saw a 21.2% y-o-y jump in net profit to RM690.03 million in its third financial quarter ended March 31, 2018 (3QFY2018), on higher net income, lower allowance for impairment losses on loans, advances and financing, and higher share of profit from an associated company. The banks aside, corporate earnings were generally down, says Inter-Pacific Securities research head Pong Teng Siew. \u201cIt was disappointing and I might even say that it was bad across the board. I would estimate that only 7% to 8% of the companies listed on Bursa Malaysia posted bottom-line growth in the first quarter,\u201d he tells The Edge. Export-oriented counters such as furniture makers generally saw a decline in their net profits in the absence of foreign exchange gain as a result of a stronger ringgit against the US dollar. Lii Hen Industries Bhd saw its net profit drop 63.2% y-o-y to RM8.13 million in the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 (1QFY2018), while Latitude Tree Holdings Bhd\u2019s net profit plunged 79.2% y-o-y to RM2.4 million. The stronger ringgit also had an adverse effect on plantation counter Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd, which saw its net profit fall 34.6% y-o-y to RM189.27 million in the second financial quarter ended March 31, 2018 (2QFY2018). Meanwhile, Felda Global Ventures Bhd\u2019s 1QFY2018 net profit declined 21.9% y-o-y to RM1.33 million. The drop in earnings was attributed to a lower average crude palm oil price of RM2,472 per tonne compared with RM3,061 in 2017. Other notable companies that missed forecasts include Axiata Group Bhd, which reported a net loss of RM147.41 million, versus a net profit of RM239.02 million in the previous year, due to a higher share of losses from its Indian associate Idea Cellular Ltd. CIMB Investment Bank has downgraded the counter to a \u201chold\u201d with a lower target price of RM5. It expects the group to post a 14% drop in earnings per share for FY2018 before rebounding in FY2019 and FY2020. Other heavyweights that registered lower profits include Telekom Malaysia Bhd and MISC Bhd. TM saw its net profit fall 32% y-o-y to RM157.16 million while MISC posted a 54.1% drop in net profit to RM310.6 million. Press Metal Holdings Bhd, which registered a 1.6% y-o-y growth in net profit to RM150.48 million, also missed expectations due to lower-than-expected aluminium selling prices realised, higher cost of carbon anode and the stronger ringgit. \u201cIt has been another disappointing quarter. Many companies performed below expectations ... the market largely expected some improvement in corporate earnings in the first quarter. \u201cMost sectors were down. Those with exposure to foreign exchange were affected by the stronger ringgit. They include the plantation, timber and technology sectors. I\u2019m expecting more negative earnings revisions than positive ones after the results season ends,\u201d Areca Capital CEO Danny Wong tells The Edge. He says the market was expecting some improvement in the first quarter of the year amid steady global growth. He notes that some construction companies had several contracts in hand, which were expected to give the sector a boost. However, this was not the case. IJM Corp Bhd posted a net profit of RM11.19 million, down 95.3% y-o-y. The big variance was mainly due to a one-off gain of RM123.1 million in the previous year and lower contributions from its five main segments. The group also saw a lower net unrealised foreign exchange gain for the quarter. Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd, despite posting 150% y-o-y growth in its net profit to RM21.5 million in 1QFY2018, also came in below expectations, according to MIDF Research. The earnings represent only 10.6% of the research house\u2019s estimates. AmInvestment Bank head of equity research Joshua Ng says the earnings reporting season was unremarkable with Sime Darby Bhd being the only FBM KLCI component stock that has surprised on the upside on better sales by its car dealerships in China and heavy equipment business in Australia. \u201cAfter factoring in the changes thus far, our FBM KLCI earnings growth forecast for 2018 has been revised to 5.4% (from 6.8%) and 2019 to 6.8% (from 7.2%),\u201d writes Ng in a June 1 note. Moving forward, AmInvestment Bank says, the removal of the Goods and Services Tax, reintroduction of petrol subsidy and the gradual abolition of highway tolls will increase consumers\u2019 propensity to spend. The research house prefers Public Bank Bhd and BIMB Holdings Bhd for their exposure to consumer spending, besides consumer and automotive stocks such as Berjaya Food Bhd, Power Root Bhd and Bermaz Auto Bhd. It also likes exporters that benefit from strong external demand such as Top Glove Corp Bhd, VS Industry Bhd and Inari Amertron Bhd as well as certain defensive oil and gas counters, such as Yinson Holdings Bhd and Dialog Bhd, amid stable crude oil prices. Looking towards the second quarter of the year, Areca Capital\u2019s Wong says he expects certain sectors to be positive such as consumers, automotive, banking and healthcare, amid better consumer sentiment. \u201cThe removal of GST will have a positive effect on consumer spending and it is particularly so for the automotive sector. Companies that import cars such as Sime Darby will benefit,\u201d he says. \u201cImproved consumer sentiment will translate into higher spending, which is positive for the retail sector.\u201d On the other hand, he says, the earnings of export-oriented counters that are not actively expanding will continue to be affected by the stronger ringgit. \u00a0 \u00a0"}, "95": {"date_posted": "11June2018", "title": "Dialog Group downgraded to hold at Maybank", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (June 11): Maybank Kim Eng analyst Liaw Thong Jung downgraded the recommendation on Dialog Group Bhd to hold from buy. * Price target (PT) raised to RM3.58 from RM3.50.

The Edge Financial Daily looks at some of these companies that manage to eke out growth and surprise the market despite the uncertainties facing investors under a new government since the Pakatan Harapan won the 14th general election, upsetting incumbent Barisan Nasional for the first time since independence from Britain more than six decades ago. \u00a0 The turnaround stories Velesto Energy Bhd, formerly known as UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd, is among the turnaround stories seen during the latest financial results. The group recorded a net profit of RM5 million in its first quarter of financial year 2018 (1QFY18) ended March 31, 2018 compared to a net loss of RM104.1 million a year ago. According to Hong Leong Investment Bank research analyst Yip Kah Ming, Velesto\u2019s rig utilisation rates improved from 26% in 1QFY17 to 65% in 1QFY18 on the back of stabilisation of crude oil prices due to production cuts by Opec. \u201cWe understand that utilisation rates in 2QFY18 are somewhat similar to the current level. Rig utilisation rates are expected to increase in 2HFY18 (second half of FY18) with two rigs expected to be mobilised from 3QFY18 onwards,\u201d Yip said. He maintains a \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation on Velesto with an unchanged target price of 39 sen based on 1 times price-to-book multiple pegged at its FY18 book value per share. TA Securities analyst Abel Goon told The Edge Financial Daily in an email exchange that the outlook for Velesto is expected to improve further as the management continues its cost rationalisation and utilisation increases. \u201cI believe the 2Q utilisation should be about 70% to 80% while 2H utilisation will likely surpass 90%,\u201d Goon said. Tan Chong Motor Holdings Bhd, a franchise holder of Nissan in Malaysia and some other countries in the region, also returned to the black during its 1QFY18 ended March 31, 2018 with a net profit of RM4.25 million compared to a net loss of RM35.3 million in 1QFY17. Maybank IB Research analyst Ivan Yap viewed the results as a positive surprise as the automotive player finally turned around after two years of losses. He noted that the better performance was mainly due to the ringgit\u2019s strength and a better sales mix. \u201cLooking ahead, with new model launches [such as Serena S Hybrid] to boost sales and persistent ringgit strength to contain imported costs, we have turned more upbeat about Tan Chong\u2019s earnings to recover, lifting expected earnings for FY18, FY19 and FY20 by 55%, 16% and 4% respectively,\u201d Yap added, saying that further earnings recovery in the sequential quarters should draw some interest back to the stock. Brian Yeoh, an analyst at Affin Hwang Investment Bank, also told The Edge Financial Daily that the tax holiday period with the abolishment of the goods and services tax on June 1 is a temporary sales boost for the automotive sector. The turnaround stories for both Velesto and Tan Chong are also in line with the recovery seen in the sectors both the companies are involved in. The oil and gas industry, which has been hurt by the plunge in oil price, is starting to see more activities as oil price stays above US$70 (RM278.60) per barrel. Similarly, the automotive industry, which has seen declining sales for a while now, is expected to see recovery as consumer sentiment continues on its path to recovery. Both sectors are also less affected by changes in government policies under Pakatan. \u00a0 Inari a favourite Inari Amertron Bhd continued to see better earnings in its 3QFY18 ended March 31, 2018 despite a stronger ringgit, recording a net profit growth of 7.8% to RM55.2 million from RM51.2 million a year ago while revenue jumped by 18.9% to RM325.8 million. Maybank IB Research\u2019s Yap has Inari as his top pick in the semiconductor sector. It was also featured as one of AmBank Research\u2019s top buys in its latest strategy report last Friday. Affin Hwang\u2019s analyst Kevin Low also maintains his \u201cbuy\u201d call on Inari with a 12-month target price (TP) of RM2.80. The counter is his top pick for the sector as well as in the Malaysian stock market. \u201cInari remains our top sector pick and a country pick. We like [the] management\u2019s growth plans, which go beyond its RF (radio frequency) assembly and testing business and should on their own see exciting prospects with the completion of new floor space capacity at plant P13B-1,\u201d Low said. He added that there could be positive earnings revisions with expected stronger 4QFY18 results. \u00a0 New kids surpass expectations Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB), Dialog Group Bhd and Hartalega Holdings Bhd, which will be added to the FBM KLCI list on June 18 after the latest review last Thursday, all recorded double-digit growth in their bottom lines during the quarter ended March 2018. MAHB\u2019s net profit of RM444.6 million in its 1QFY18 was a positive surprise to the market, driven mainly by unrealised gain on the fair value of investment in GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd amounting to RM258.4 million. \u201cMAHB\u2019s 1QFY18 results were above market\u2019s and our expectations. Core net profit jumped 101% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM146 million in 1QFY18, driven by stronger revenue growth, outpacing the increase in operating expenses. \u201cRevenue increased 11% y-o-y to RM1.22 billion, driven by passenger growth of 3.4% y-o-y in Malaysia and 18.2% in Turkey. Net profit of RM445 million exceeded consensus full-year forecast of RM384 million and comprised 74% of our previous estimate of RM600 million. It jumped 5.8-fold y-o-y on a net exceptional gain of RM299 million and better operating performance,\u201d Affin Hwang analyst Loong Chee Wei noted after the announcement of its results. Nonetheless, Loong said that the uncertainties in the proposed regulated asset base (RAB) framework will likely continue to dampen sentiment on the stock. RAB is an initiative by the Malaysian Aviation Commission to regulate airports in the country. Similar to Loong, Mohshin Aziz from Maybank IB Research pointed out that the 1QFY18 results were above expectations and that MAHB benefited from the higher international passenger composition that pays three to five times higher passenger service charge (PSC) and is entitled to buy duty-free items. \u201cIn addition, the equalisation of PSC for international passengers at klia2 from RM50 to RM73 also helped raise unit revenues. There are some airlines which are defiant and paying the old PSC rate of RM50 but MAHB has escalated this to a court hearing,\u201d he said in his report on May 30. While the outlook is viewed positively, Mohshin highlighted that the impending quality of service measure, due to begin in the third quarter of this year, is still a risk to be monitored. Dialog\u2019s net profit for its 3QFY18 grew by 25.88% to RM118.8 million from RM94.4 million in the corresponding quarter a year ago. Kenanga Research analyst Lum Joe Shen said that the group saw record quarterly earnings, backed by its top-line growth of 1% and stronger earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation margins by 1.4 percentage points due to higher recognition of downstream contracts as well as better upstream exploration and production contributions from the higher oil price environment. Lum reiterates his \u201coutperform\u201d recommendation with a higher sum-of-parts (SoP)-derived TP of RM3.70 with key catalysts being the FBM KLCI inclusion, concrete developments at Pengerang Phase 3 and further crystallisation of earnings growth. Hartalega, which recorded 30.4% growth in its bottom line to RM116.6 million for its 4QFY18 ended March 31, 2018, was nonetheless negatively impacted by the appreciation of the ringgit. Affin Hwang\u2019s analyst covering the stock, Ng Chi Hoong, however, pointed out that the negative impact from the foreign exchange was mitigated by a lower effective tax rate. He noted that the management expects to be able to pass on the impact of the currency going forward, as it has already passed on higher natural gas cost, which is an indication that demand will remain robust. Ng also highlighted the current expansion schedule will see the addition of five billion pieces or about 15%-18% of new capacity for the next two years to meet demand and given the group\u2019s utilisation rate of 90%, the new capacity is likely to be earnings-accretive. \u00a0 Hong Leong outperformed peers Both Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd (HLFG) and Hong Leong Bank Bhd (HLB) were among the best-performing financial groups during the quarter to March, reporting net profit growth of 21.16% and 20.01% to RM690 million and RM502.6 million respectively. Affin Hwang analyst Tan Ei Leen said HLB\u2019s net profit was in line with the research house\u2019s expectation but ahead of consensus by 5.4%. \u00a0 \u201cThe group\u2019s 9MFY18 (first nine months of FY18) results remain solid, underpinned by a firmer operating income (7.8% growth y-o-y, with stronger growth in non-interest income), while Bank of Chengdu\u2019s earnings contribution (16.4% of 9MFY18\u2019s profit before tax) was up 67.3% y-o-y,\u201d she said in her note after the results were announced last Wednesday. Ng from AmBank Research also pointed out that HLFG was one of the two companies on the FBM KLCI that surprised on the upside. The other one was Sime Darby Bhd. In comparison, Malaysia\u2019s largest bank, Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank), recorded a net profit growth of 9.9% to RM1.87 billion while Public Bank Bhd saw a growth of 12.6% in its bottom line to RM1.41 billion during the same period. CIMB Group Holdings Bhd managed to grow its net profit by 10.6% to RM1.31 billion in the first quarter. While earnings continued to grow for most of the banks in Malaysia in the latest financial results, a fund manager with a local asset management cautioned that a lot of the loan growth that was priced in at the beginning of the year had taken into account some of the infrastructure projects that were scrapped by Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad. Among them are the Malaysia-Singapore high-speed rail and the mass rapid transit line 3. \u201cWithout some of these projects, loan growth could be lower than expected. This has led to some negative sentiment on the sector as a whole as well,\u201d he said. \u00a0 Poultry play Lay Hong Bhd saw the net profit for its 4QFY18 ended March 31, 2018 almost double to RM10.99 million from RM5.68 million a year ago on higher contribution from integrated livestock farming segment arising from higher egg sales volume, higher quantity of processed frozen products and pasteurised liquid eggs. According to Hong Leong Investment Bank research analyst Chye Wen Fei, the weaker performance at retail supermarket division was more than compensated by higher contribution in the integrated livestock farming segment. Chye maintains a \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation with an unchanged SoP-derived TP of RM1.24. \u201cWe continue to like Lay Hong for its exciting earnings growth prospects, underpinned by its expansion plan [at the upstream segment] and tie-up with NH Foods, which allows Lay Hong to expand its market reach by leveraging on NH Foods\u2019 wide geographical network,\u201d Chye said. Another poultry player, CAB Cakaran Corp Bhd, also saw strong double-digit growth in its latest 2QFY18 net profit, which increased 15.9% to RM11.5 million from RM9.92 million a year ago while revenue rose 21.7% to RM424.9 million. The higher revenue was achieved on the back of strong sales growth of the integrated poultry division. Rakuten Trade has a \u201cbuy\u201d call on CAB Cakaran with a TP of RM1.16 as the poultry player remains on its buy radar for its growth story namely the joint venture (JV) with Salim Group Indonesia. \u201cCAB\u2019s collaboration with Salim Group would be the next growth catalyst in Indonesia. CAB currently holds a 10% stake in the JV and has the option to increase to 30% over the next five years. The construction of a broiler and layer farm in Indonesia is expected to commence in 3QFY18 and start to contribute in 2019 targeting 4.5 million birds and three million eggs. Salim Group has 10,000 Indomaret convenience stores and 500 KFC outlets,\u201d Kenny Yee, Rakuten Trade\u2019s head of research, said in the note prior to the release of CAB\u2019s results."}, "99": {"date_posted": "2June2018", "title": "Markets: Why direct listing is seen as a viable alternative", "article": " In early April, Spotify USA Inc\u2019s debut on the New York Stock Exchange made headlines as the digital music service provider had opted for an unusual process \u2014 a direct listing. This has sparked discussions about the benefits of such a process and whether investors can look forward to similar listings in the future on the local bourse. It is an alternative way for a company to list its shares on the stock exchange without going through an initial public offering. The latter requires a company to hire an investment bank to act as its principal adviser and underwriter to list its shares on the exchange. In the case of Spotify, it had saved millions of dollars by taking the direct listing route instead of doing an IPO. \u201cHowever, not all companies can list the Spotify way. Only those that are already well-known in the market and have a strong brand name can do so,\u201d says Ian Yoong, a former investment banker with 29 years of experience in the industry. Without a strong brand name, there would be a lack of market interest in the shares, he adds. \u201cBut if the company hires an investment bank, it could tap into the underwriter\u2019s connection to locate investors.\u201d The direct listing route is not available in Malaysia at present. Local companies that wish to be listed on the Main Market or ACE Market are required to go through investment banks, says Yoong. Under Bursa Malaysia\u2019s listing rules, all companies seeking to list must sell at least 25% of their shares to public investors, including institutional and private ones. \u201cAnd if the shares are not fully subscribed by the public investors, it is the underwriter\u2019s responsibility to purchase the remaining shares,\u201d explains an investment banker, who declined to be named. Yoong believes direct listings could be successfully implemented in Malaysia. \u201cI previously worked in a bank. When the market sentiment was buoyant, I saw public and private investors calling up the managing director and chief financial officer [of a listed company] to express their interest in buying a block of their shares. It is doable if the issuing company has a strong name.\u201d He says by allowing this, the country\u2019s capital market could grow further. \u201cAs the market opens up, I\u2019m confident that the authorities will be looking into this. After all, it helps to grow the capital market and there is nothing detrimental or controversial about it. It\u2019s unlike the dual-class stock structure [that provides different investors with different voting powers].\u201d However, the direct listing trend may not take off in Malaysia in the immediate future as the fees required to do an IPO locally are low compared with those in the more developed markets in Asia, Yoong explains. He points out that the fees in Singapore and Hong Kong are, in general, about 5% to 6% of the total funds raised. This is compared with 1.5% to 4% in Malaysia. \u201cIf a small-cap company had raised HK$500 million in Hong Kong, HK$25 million to HK$30 million would go to the underwriter. In Malaysia, [the same amount raised in ringgit] would cost around RM4 million to RM5 million.\u201d Arvin Chia, senior director and head of equity capital market at Affin Hwang Investment Bank Bhd, says there have only been 11 direct listings in the US in the past 20 years. \u201cThe historical number suggests that it is not a trend yet as there had only been about one direct listing every two years.\u201d Nevertheless, Chia remarks that investment bankers have to be aware of how technology has changed the way companies raise funds. \u201cThere are more alternative ways of raising funds, enabled by recent technology advancements.\u201d The direct listing trend could benefit investors and provide them with access to more investment options going forward. \u201cInvestors would be able to invest in more companies if the direct listing trend takes off locally. It would also allow smaller-sized companies with strong brand names to list their shares on the stock exchange and raise funds from the public at a lower cost,\u201d says Yoong. \u00a0 What does this mean for investors? Yoong says direct listings are akin to allowing investors to \u201cbuy products online directly from the providers instead of buying it in the supermarket\u201d. As companies that choose this route would not need to go through the underwriting process, would investing in them be riskier? According to Yoong, the risk is higher as investors are investing in smaller-sized companies that do not have a longer-term proven track record in terms of profit and revenue. \u201cHowever, these companies will still need to fulfil the requirements listed out by the exchanges and regulators. They need to conduct a proper audit and meet the threshold of profits and revenue required by the exchanges. \u201cThe higher risk is not due to direct listings, but the fundamentals of the companies,\u201d he says. An investment banker, who declines to be named, says a potential risk of a direct-listed company is price fluctuation. For companies that go through the IPO route, when their share price plunges below a certain level, their underwriter would act as a stabilising manager by buying back shares from the market to stabilise their share price. In the local context, this could be done in the 30 days after the companies\u2019 shares began trading on Bursa. For instance, Maybank Investment Bank Bhd, which is the principal adviser and one of the underwriters of Lotte Chemical Titan Holding Bhd, bought back 4.8% of the company\u2019s shares offered under the IPO when its share price tanked due to undersubscription by public investors. As there is no underwriter involved in the direct listing process, investors may see a company\u2019s share price plunge on its debut on the stock market if other investors sell their shares due to various reasons. \u201cHowever, the involvement of underwriters does not mean that investors can be totally rid of price volatility. The volatility could still be there,\u201d says the investment banker. Looking at the bigger picture, the investment banker says the success of Spotify\u2019s direct listing is good news for investors. It shows that competition between the public and private fundraising sectors is increasing. As a result, investors can expect more investment options being offered to them by public exchanges going forward as more companies gain access to public funding. \u201cLook at the last 10 years. There has not been a shortage of money in the private market. The private equity and venture capitalist space are flush [with investment money],\u201d says the investment banker. \u201cLook at how SoftBank Group Corp invested heavily in start-ups such as Uber and Grab. These companies are not publicly listed but they raised billions [in the private market]. They did not need an IPO to tap the capital market.\u201d More alternative ways of raising funds have come about thanks to the advancement of technology recently, the investment banker points out. These include equity crowdfunding, peer-to-peer financing and initial coin offerings. \u201cOne might say the total amount raised by these alternative fundraising activities is small. But it will grow bigger and the amount raised could increase in the next few years. \u201cPlayers, from the banks to the start-ups [that facilitate alternative fundraising activities], like to say that there is no direct competition between the two sides as the latter mainly serves the underserved companies that could not obtain funding from banks. However, it is possible that one day, when these start-ups grow bigger, they could compete with banks. \u201cTechnology is changing the landscape of many industries, including the financial industry. Investment bankers have to be very aware of this.\u201d The investment banker says this is why stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange, are allowing direct listings. The trend can also be seen in Malaysia. \u201cI think this is part of the reason why Bursa introduced the LEAP Market \u2014 to allow companies with good potential, but are less established and still loss-making, to raise funds publicly.\u201d"}, "100": {"date_posted": "30May2018", "title": "Malaysia shares set for worst day since 2008 as foreigners bail", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (May 30): It was a pretty bad day for Asian stock markets. For Malaysia, it was even worse. The FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index plunged as much as 3.7 percent, with losses snowballing after the midday break. The gauge headed for its biggest single-day slump since October 2008 as of 4:09 p.m. local time, with declines surpassing those of all other national benchmarks in the region. Malaysian markets were shut on Tuesday for a holiday. Builders suffered the brunt of the selling as Gamuda Bhd sank as much as 27 percent after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said the government would cancel a proposed multibillion-dollar, high-speed railway link to Singapore and the third phase of a mass rapid transit line in Kuala Lumpur.

The Malaysian index, which only last month traded at a record, is now down more than 9 percent from its peak as traders adjust to a new political environment. Foreign investors have fled the nation\u2019s stocks, pulling money every single day this month -- a streak unseen since the selloff of August 2015."}, "101": {"date_posted": "30May2018", "title": "FBM KLCI seen to continue upward trajectory", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: The benchmark FBM KLCI, which had come off 6.3% from its all-time high of 1,895.18 on April 19, is expected to rebound and continue on its upward trajectory throughout 2018, with analysts predicting it could hit as high as 1,920 points. AmBank Research has set its end-2018 target of 1,900 points for the FBM KLCI, based on 18 times 2018 forward earnings. This is at a one-time multiple premium to the five-year historical average of about 17 times, largely to reflect the cyclical upturn in corporate earnings growth, it said. The index has remained volatile since the 14th general election on May 9 that saw a surprise victory for the Pakatan Harapan government, breaking the Barisan Nasional government\u2019s 60-year rule. The new government\u2019s revelation that Malaysia\u2019s debt now stands at an alarming RM1 trillion did not help calm markets. The FBM KLCI closed down 21.56 points or 1.2% at 1,775.84 on Monday, ahead of yesterday\u2019s Wesak Day holiday. \u201cWe believe the key catalysts for the [FBM] KLCI could potentially come from the normalisation of the market risk premium as greater clarity on new government policies emerges,\u201d AmBank Research said in a report entitled \u201cMalaysia: 1Q2018 Half-time Report \u2014 Unremarkable So Far\u201d on Monday. The local research firm said another catalyst that will drive a rebound in the FBM KLCI is improved sentiment towards emerging markets, which are experiencing an outflow of funds at present. \u201c[This is] when at some point the market feels the US rate hike cycle and the US dollar upcycle are about to taper off, and when the risk-and-reward profile and valuation-to-growth matrix of emerging markets become attractive again after the recent sell-off. \u201cThe sentiment towards emerging markets will also improve if commodity prices stay firm, strengthening the finances of commodity-exporting emerging markets,\u201d it added. AmBank Research also said another catalyst for the FBM KLCI could potentially come from a more level playing field across the sectors, which may unleash the growth potential in corporate Malaysia. Meanwhile, the research firm warned that the performance of the FBM KLCI could potentially be weighed down by stronger-than-expected US inflation and wage growth, rekindling the prospects of a steeper rate hike cycle in the US and a stronger US dollar, which could spur more outflows from emerging markets. \u201cThe escalation in the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions, and earnings disappointments from [FBM] KLCI heavyweights such as banks, telecommunications companies and Tenaga Nasional Bhd [could also weigh on the index],\u201d it said. AmBank Research noted the first-quarter 2018 (1Q18) reporting season has been a \u201ctad discouraging\u201d so far, which led it to revise down its FBM KLCI earnings growth forecast for 2018 to 5.3% from 6.8%, while that for 2019 to 7.1% from 7.2%, underpinned by a gross domestic product growth of 5.5% and 5.3% respectively. \u201cThus far, only one [FBM] KLCI index-linked heavyweight has surprised to the upside \u2014 Sime Darby Bhd, thanks to the better showing from its car dealerships in China and heavy equipment business in Australia,\u201d AmBank Research said. \u201cOn the other hand, Telekom Malaysia Bhd disappointed due to a sharp contraction in voice, data and other telco services, although [it was] partly mitigated by increased Internet revenue. Similarly, MISC Bhd was hurt by lower petroleum tanker charter rates and reduced earnings from its offshore production business. \u201cMeanwhile, Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd missed expectations due to lower-than-expected aluminium selling prices realised, higher cost of carbon anode and the ringgit\u2019s strength,\u201d it added. Maybank Investment Bank Bhd chartist Nik Ihsan Raja Abdullah sees the possibility of the FBM KLCI returning to the 1,800 levels as early as this week or next week as the market digests the fiscal reforms currently being studied by the Council of Eminent Persons. \u201cThere will be market corrections. It is not so much about breaking that 1,800-point mark, but the ability for the market to stay within that range which will reflect better sentiment and confidence in the local equity market,\u201d he told The Edge Financial Daily. Nik Ihsan\u2019s technical analysis sees the FBM KLCI trying to breach the level of 1,900 points for end-2018, subject to factors such as volatility of the crude oil price, the ringgit and the rollout of plans to reform the country\u2019s fiscal health. MIDF Amanah Investment Bank Bhd head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman is cautious about whether the market could gain a foothold in the medium term as investors would need some convincing from the earnings side, particularly from firms that derive the bulk of their income from government-related jobs. \u201cThere are risks to the earnings projection, which not only affects the construction sector but also other services sectors such as technology-related [ones]. Also, concession assets might be impacted by reviews of concession agreements such as the national utilities firm and toll concessionaires,\u201d he told The Edge Financial Daily. Mohd Redza sees companies that chalk earnings from the plantation sector are also at risk, given lower commodity prices, coupled with increasing costs from replanting exercise and a possible rise in minimum wage. \u201cTherefore, I reckon the markets will see rather volatile movements in the short- to medium term,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be tame months, maybe more than half a year or even longer for the dust to settle and for investors to see the light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d For now, Mohd Redza advises investors to be patient and employ a tactical strategy to buy beaten-down stocks with defensive earnings. \u201cThose counters that have a track record of proven dividend-paying capability will weather the storm,\u201d he said. He added that MIDF may revise its year-end FBM KLCI target after the end of the 1Q18 reporting season. \u201cWe may review our [FBM] KLCI target, and depending on the earnings climate, it could be a potential downgrade from our current 1,900 year-end target. It is still too early to predict anything now, but the best gauge would be after we have considered earnings from stocks within our universe of coverages,\u201d he said. Mohd Redza\u2019s stock picks are banking counters, but he is staying away from major heavyweight constituents of the index that are in telecommunications, utilities and plantation sectors. Nomura Securities Malaysia Sdn Bhd holds the highest year-end target of 1,920 for the FBM KLCI as it expects the new government will come out with policies which address the fiscal concerns, as well as embark on reforms which could potentially improve investor sentiment in the medium term. \u201cWhile clearly there is uncertainty in policies of the government, we are comforted to see that, in a very short span of time, the government of [Tun] Dr Mahathir [Mohamed] has been able to move quite fast [for example, some key cabinet positions have been announced; the announcement of the Council of Eminent Persons; and an independent five-member committee was formed on May 15 by this council to look into institutional reforms in Malaysia],\u201d said Nomura in a report dated May 24. For Hong Leong Investment Bank Research analyst Loui Low Ley Yee, he is maintaining his FBM KLCI target of 1,880 points for end-2018 as he views Bursa Malaysia\u2019s near-term outlook remains challenging. \u201cGiven the persistent external threats from trade wars and the US dollar strength coupled with renewed geopolitical tensions, Bursa Malaysia\u2019s near-term outlook remains challenging as traders may still be focusing on the ballooning national debts and anticipate the next action plan by PH (Pakatan) to resolve the debt status. \u201cMoreover, recent heightened concerns over the 1Malaysia Development Bhd newsflows and the review of construction megaprojects and toll concessions may dampen the overall trading sentiment,\u201d he said in a note to clients last Friday."}, "102": {"date_posted": "30May2018", "title": "HSR-linked stocks seen in focus, support for KLCI at 1,768", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (May 30): Investor sentiment at the local market is likely to be rattled today following the decision of the Pakatan Harapan government to nix the US$110 billion High Speed Rail (HSR) project linking Kuala Lumpur and Singapore which is likely to have a knock on effect on stocks previously linked with the job.

A spiraling Italian political crisis provoked a global stock market sell-off on Tuesday, cut the euro to a 10-month low and spiked borrowing costs for the government in Rome, according to Reuters.

The benchmark index subsequently fell to a low of 1,774.40 as market participants continued to play on selling side.

That gave a market breadth of 0.60 indicating the bears were in better control,\u201d it said. AllianceDBS Research said the market made a lower low on May 28 with the benchmark index falling to a low of 1,774.40.

The research house said following the down close on May 28, there should be selling attempt with immediate support at 1,768. It said a fall below 1,768 would put pressure on the market to test the next support at 1,750. \u201cThe analysis of overall market action on May 28 revealed that buying power was weaker than selling pressure. \u201cAs such, the FBM KLCI would likely trade below the 1,774.40 level on May 30,\u201d said AllianceDBS Research.

The government had guaranteed RM38 billion of 1MDB\u2019s debt as at end-2017, and there is much interest in how it plans to tackle this. The ringgit, which has been on a downward trend against the US dollar along with other emerging market currencies, will also be watched to see if falls back to the RM4 level.

At home, Bank Negara Malaysia is expected to release its detailed disclosure of the international reserves as at end-April. And on the corporate front, there will be a slew of 1Q earnings releases this week as public-listed companies rush to meet the May 30 deadline for reporting. Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) will release its first-quarter financial results on Monday, while CIMB Group Holdings Bhd will do so on Wednesday. AMMB Holdings and DRB-Hicom Bhd are expected to release their full-year results this week. Meanwhile, Sime Darby Plantations Bhd and Thriven Global Bhd\u2019s 1Q earnings will be out on Thursday. Companies scheduled to have annual general meetings this week include IHH Healthcare Bhd (May 28), Puncak Niaga Holdings Bhd, Destini Bhd, Magnum Bhd and Bumi Armada Bhd (May 30). In the stock market, Maybank will be watched after its shares fell sharply last Thursday on large volume, likely because of concerns over its exposure to Singapore-listed water treatment company Hyflux Ltd, which sought court protection on May 22 to reorganise its business and address its debt pile. Maybank closed 42 sen, or 3.9%, lower to RM10.26 last Thursday, with 84.9 million shares traded, more than double the previous day. The following day, the stock closed flat. Maybank\u2019s Singapore branch had provided an 18-year S$720 million financing facility to Hyflux\u2019s Tuaspring project in 2013. Moody\u2019s Investors Service, however, said in a statement last Friday that the potential losses to Maybank should be limited as it believes the bank\u2019s exposure has decreased since 2013 because of loan amortisation. The ratings agency assumes that most or all of Maybank\u2019s exposure is secured by the Tuaspring project or related cash- flow receivables, or both.

The country will also announce the unemployment rate for May on June 1. Several Federal Reserve officials are expected to speak in public forums, including Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic (May 31) and governor Lael Brainard (June 1). The Fed is also scheduled to release its latest Beige Book report \u2014 a qualitative review of economic conditions \u2014 on May 30 . Apart from that, the US Fed is expected to hold an open board meeting, also on May 30, to discuss changes to the Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from making their own risky bets using customers\u2019 deposits.

Maybank shares took a beating yesterday, possibly on concerns over its exposure to Hyflux, which had on May 22 applied for court protection to facilitate the restructuring of some of its S$1.5 billion in outstanding debt. The company had also announced that it planned to skip the upcoming coupon on its S$500 million perpetual capital securities. Maybank's stock fell as much as 7.6% to its intraday low of RM9.87 in early trade yesterday, before closing 3.9% or 42 sen lower at RM10.26. At 3.49pm today, Maybank shares were 4 sen or 0.39% lower at RM10.22, with 13.03 million shares done, bringing a market capitalisation of RM111.68 billion. According to Hyflux's annual report, its creditors include around 30 financial institutions, mostly Singapore branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks. The rating agency said these institutions, as well as other investors, could suffer losses on their Hyflux exposures. Moody's vice president and senior credit officer Eugene Tarzimanov also highlighted that Hyflux has a large amount of secured debt, which heightens the risk to its unsecured creditors. The rating agency pointed out that 68% of Hyflux's debt is unsecured, with 51% in unsecured bank loans. However, Moody's does not see the debt restructuring of Hyflux leading to a general deterioration in the asset quality of bank loans to other large power generation companies in the city-state. Moody's said for Hyflux creditors, the restructuring could involve a combination of haircuts, the extension of debt maturities or adjustments to interest rates, leading to possible financial losses. \"Nevertheless, most large power generation companies in Singapore have strong shareholders with diversified portfolios of generation assets,\" said Tarzimanov. \"In addition, these companies' power assets were mostly commissioned some years ago, implying that the debt load on these projects would be more manageable when compared with Hyflux's Tuaspring, which was commissioned in 2015,\" he added. \u00a0"}, "105": {"date_posted": "25May2018", "title": "Maybank down on concern over exposure to Singapore\u2019s Hyflux", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: Malayan Banking Bhd\u2019s (Maybank) share price fell sharply yesterday, possibly on concerns over its exposure to Singapore-listed water treatment company Hyflux Ltd, which on Tuesday sought court protection to reorganise its business and address its debt pile.

This is a question that Lim Tze Cheng, CEO of Inter-Pacific Asset Management Sdn Bhd, often asks when recruiting investment analysts. The answers can vary widely. He once put this question to an analyst friend and she said she would pay RM2 million for the bakery. Then he asked what her favourite stock was. \u201cShe named this company that I knew the numbers of. It was trading at a price-earnings ratio (PER) of 25 times. I said \u2018Look, in the case of this bakery, you are only willing to pay two times PER, but in that case, you\u2019re willing to pay 25 times. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right or wrong, but do you see the gap in valuation of what you\u2019re willing to pay? What\u2019s the difference then?\u2019 That really caught her by surprise,\u201d Lim says. This was because the analyst viewed her favourite stock as a listed company and was thus willing to pay a premium for it. On the other hand, she saw the bakery as just a business. But that\u2019s what investors tend to forget, which is that investing in shares is actually investing in businesses. Lim shares this anecdote in his new book, What I learnt as an analyst, in which he aims to send this message across and equip readers with the tools to properly evaluate businesses. The lessons are gleaned from his experience as a fund manager, analyst and head of research in local and global asset management firms over the years. \u201cIf you think about it, a lot of people are investing in the stock market and not doing the research. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not the right way, but they regard it more like a gambling den or they [invest] based on rumours, [for example] what\u2019s the hottest thing in the market? \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t really understand what the stock market is. Even if they\u2019re keen to know how to analyse companies before they invest, they don\u2019t really know how. I wanted to write something for the layman with no accounting or finance background but who really wants to invest. It\u2019s something for them to read and to understand what the stock market is about,\u201d Lim says. There are many books about investing strategies available but some are very technical in nature and others focus too much on profiling the author. Lim aims to equip readers with the basic skills of analysis without being too technical or personal. \u201cIn hindsight, I can say I made the right call but who knows, it could be plain luck. By telling you what successes I\u2019ve made, how does that help you? You can\u2019t repeat the same thing with other stocks because, really, investment is an art. If you read my book, you\u2019ll notice there is nothing about me. I didn\u2019t mention anything about me or about what I got right. It\u2019s about which tools you can use,\u201d he says. His motivation for spreading financial literacy through writing partly comes from his observation of how the two financial crises in 1997 and 2008 claimed the lives of people he knew after they suffered severe losses in the stock market. \u201cIn 1997, when I was still in Form Five, I had a friend whose father actually committed suicide after the financial crisis. In 2008, when we were all working, the stock market caused another ex-classmate to take his own life. But why is that? It\u2019s because they didn\u2019t really understand what the purpose of the stock market is,\u201d he says. \u201cAssuming you invest in a safe stock like Maybank, and it is down 15% in a crisis. Do you need to commit suicide? You don\u2019t need the money now. It\u2019s for retirement, so you can afford to wait. But what really affects people is when they try to leverage with money they don\u2019t even have.\u201d Many people invest based on \u201chot tips\u201d from their acquaintances, but often, when that information \u2014 given that it is true \u2014 reaches the average investor, it is already too late, he says. Those closest to the source have already taken their positions. \u201cI say forget all about hot news. That is the reality a lot of people don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t invest based on hot tips; I invest in businesses.\u201d \u00a0 From investing in unit trusts to analysing balance sheets The book is divided into two parts \u2014 the first introduces unit trusts as a form of investment, and the second is about shares as an investment. The first section explains how unit trusts work, the fees that will be incurred, and good methods to invest in them. The second part, on the other hand, deals with what investors should do before they invest in shares. Lim teaches readers how to analyse income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements. Annual reports from actual listed companies are used as examples. He also explains ratios to help readers make sense of the numbers they see in the statements. \u201cNow that you know how to look at and compare ratios, then comes the interesting question of how much you are willing to pay for a stock. That\u2019s the valuation part. It\u2019s very subjective, so what I tell you is that these are the tools to help you make a decision but it\u2019s impossible for me to tell you what the decisions are. Ten people may go to the same analyst briefing and all will have very different opinions after that simply because investment is an art. What separates them are the tools that they use to judge the companies,\u201d he says. Other subjects he broaches are corporate exercises to help readers understand what it means, for example, when companies offer bonus issues and warrants. The last chapter touches on Lim\u2019s mission outside of the financial industry. As an active social worker, he is eager to spread the concept that investors should channel part of their earnings to do social good. He argues that for a market to work, there must be a willing buyer and willing seller. For example, if one sells a stock because he believes it has reached its full value, then whoever is buying from him at that price will be losing money, according to his valuation. \u201cSo, wouldn\u2019t it be right to say that whatever wealth you have accumulated in the stock market actually comes from other people? While they may or may not be making money from buying the shares, the motivation is for you to sell at the price which you think is the fair value. The other party could be a retiree or an old auntie, so it could be her life savings. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s wrong to make money from that, but let\u2019s do some good with the money you made from the public. Why not allocate a bit of your profit to do something good?\u201d In the book, he talks about the InterPac Social Enterprise & Responsibility Fund, which disburses 20% of the gain generated for investors to support social causes, as an example. \u201cI\u2019m not selling the product; I\u2019m selling the idea. If you believe in the idea, it doesn\u2019t only work if you invest with us. The whole idea is if you understand the concept, then do it yourself. I think being involved in social work really helps me to see the other side of humanity. It\u2019s not wrong to make money \u2014 that\u2019s how we survive. But in the course of making money, you must also understand there are other parts of society in need of help,\u201d he says. The net proceeds from the sale and distribution of the book will be donated to Kriyalakshmi Mandir Shree Sai Gurukul Charitable Society. He was inspired by the founder of the international Buddhist order Fo Guang Shan, who built a temple from the sales proceeds of his book. \u201c[That gave me the final push] because I\u2019m also involved in social causes. This could also be a way for me to contribute in terms of fundraising for charitable societies. I can kill two birds with one stone. On the one hand, it\u2019s something I\u2019ve always wanted to do, which is spreading financial literacy, and secondly, I get to raise funds for social good,\u201d he says. \u00a0 Going back to the basics of investing Modern finance theory has introduced complicated models that attempt to analyse the market. But investors should not forget that the stock market was originally set up to fund businesses, and a simple tool like PER can be useful enough to evaluate companies, Lim observes. That is a key lesson he wants to impart to readers. \u201cDo what any businessman will do. [Before investing, ask yourself] do you believe in this business? Do you think there is potential for the business? Do you think the current management is running the company well? Those are the basic questions you should ask.\u201d If they do well, investors can build their wealth for retirement through careful stock picking. But Lim says investors should avoid another bad habit: comparing themselves with others. If making returns of 30% is your goal, then you should be content with it, he suggests. \u201cYour financial goal is something very personal. If you think you\u2019re happy with 30% and you obtain that return, why should you be upset that the other guy is getting 50%?\u201d Going forward, he might consider writing another book based on his experiences as a fund manager. \u201cI\u2019m half serious about this. I\u2019m thinking my second book could be \u2018What I learned as a fund manager\u2019. But rather than telling you all the success stories, I tell you all the things that went wrong. That\u2019s more important. When I teach in the charity school here, I tell the students there to make mistakes, because only when you make mistakes, do you realise where you went wrong,\u201d Lim says."}, "111": {"date_posted": "21May2018", "title": "MYEG actively traded on bargain hunting as selldown seen as overdone", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (May 21): MY EG Services Bhd (MYEG) topped Bursa Malaysia\u2019s active list and was most actively traded this morning, following three successive limit down last week, which saw more than RM5.84 billion wiped out from its market capitalisation. When contacted, Maybank Investment Bank Bhd chartist Nik Ihsan Raja Abdullah said MYEG\u2019s share price has been very volatile as investors digest on the outcome of the historic 14th general election (GE14) and re-asses their position. \u201cThe stock is not just oversold, but it is extremely oversold. Investors are bargain hunting for opportunities, and making assessment on what position to take in the stock,\u201d Nik Ihsan told theedgemarkets.com over the telephone today. Since the opening bell today, MYEG has seen 53.73 million shares exchanging hands, equivalent to 1.49% of its share capital. This morning, the stock rose by as much as 4.86% or 4.5 sen to 97 sen, from a previous close of 92.5 sen. At 10:17am, MYEG shares have pared down its gain and was trading at 96 sen, for a market capitalisation of RM3.46 billion. Last week, UOB Kay Hian Securities (M) Sdn Bhd said value has started to emerge in MYEG, after the latter\u2019s share price plunged around 65% to its third successive limit down, following the shock outcome of the 14th general election (GE14). On Friday (May 18), UOB Kay Hian was among the minority brokerage firms that had upgraded MYEG shares to \u201cBuy\u201d, but lowered its target price to RM1.06, from RM1.97 previously. \u201cThis comes on the back of heightened fears of political risks, following Pakatan Harapan\u2019s general election win last week. The risk of its GST monitoring system being scrapped has been fully discounted, and more importantly, we foresee the concession of its efficient e-government portal being continued,\u201d UOB Kay Hian analyst Vincent Khoo said in a May 18 note to clients last week. UOB Kay Hian\u2019s note was following the remark of MYEG group managing director Wong Thean Soon, who had reportedly told analysts in a close-door meeting and defended the stock as having a first-mover advantage, which is a huge plus point that will enable it to compete efficiently and effectively in the electronic government services sector. Meanwhile, following GE14, CIMB Investment Bank Bhd said MYEG is at risk of losing future earnings from its GST monitoring project, in which the tax is expected to be scrapped by the newly-formed government over the next 100 days. As a result, CIMB had on May 14 downgraded MyEG to \u201creduce\u201d from \u201chold\u201d, and lowered its target price to RM1.86, from RM3.04 previously. A few days later, Credit Suisse Securities Malaysia Sdn Bhd joined CIMB and downgraded MYEG shares to \u201cunderperform\u201d from \u201cneutral\u201d, and slashed the 12-month target price to 90 sen, from RM2.70 previously."}, "112": {"date_posted": "18May2018", "title": "Bursa suspends short selling of Litrak, Cahya Mata Sarawak, ahead of toll announcement", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (May 18): Bursa Malaysia said it has suspended the proprietary day trader (PDT) and intraday short selling (IDSS) activities for the rest of the day for Lingkaran Trans Kota Holdings Bhd (Litrak) and Cahya Mata Sarawak Bhd (CMSB).\n\u00a0\nAccording to the stock exchange regulator, trading under PDT and IDSS have been suspended for the rest of the day, as the last done price have dropped by more than 15 sen or 15% from the reference price.\u00a0 \u201cThe PDT and IDSS activities will only be enabled the following trading day, i.e. Monday, May 21, 2018 at 8:30 am,\u201d Bursa Malaysia added.\u00a0 Since the opening bell and as at 3:30pm, Litrak and CMSB have dominated Bursa Malaysia\u2019s losers list.\u00a0 Litrak, a toll highway operator, was the biggest casualty on the local bourse today and its share price fell by RM1.45 or 28.21%, after one of the Council of Eminent Persons members, Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, said the government is likely to make an announcement on toll charges as early as next week.\u00a0 This has wiped out RM765.49 million off Litrak\u2019s market capitalisation.

Despite its decent earnings, its ACE Market status had kept the company off the radar screen of investors. But with last month\u2019s approval for a transfer to the Main Market, things are looking up for the group, which provides customised automation solutions for back-end semiconductor processes and light-emitting diode industries. MMSV CEO Sia Teik Keat believes the migration after 12 years is what the group needs to gain prominence among institutional investors who are more familiar with other Penang-based tech companies listed on the Main Market, such as Globetronics Technology Bhd, ViTrox Corp Bhd, Elsoft Research Bhd and Pentamaster Corp Bhd. \u201cWe hope the transfer will help us draw institutional investors such as the pension funds to the company,\u201d he tells The Edge. The group would also appreciate more attractive valuations, given that it is valued at 10.86 times historical earnings compared with Elsoft\u2019s 22.79 times and Pentamaster\u2019s 17.64 times. Earnings-wise, 2017 was a bumper year for MMSV as net profit and revenue more than doubled to a record high of RM21.06 million and RM75.57 million respectively. \u201cOur good performance last year was because we managed to capture contribution from two new types of machines for the smartphone segment. One of the machines has a vision inspection system to check and measure the complete unit of [a camera] flash while the other checks sensors for 3D facial recognition. \u201cBoth machines were for two different customers based in Penang but with each serving the same end customer,\u201d says Sia. Every revolutionary upgrade to smartphones means more features to be tested, which means good business for companies that provide customised solutions, especially those like MMSV. \u201cYou could be the primary source providing the solutions to the customer or the secondary source. But the volume assigned to the secondary source is usually much lower. So for our business, it\u2019s either you are in or you are out,\u201d observes Sia. He remarks that repeating the group\u2019s FY2017 success will not be easy as it takes time to develop new enhanced features for smart devices. Indeed, he expects a 10% to 15% drop in revenue in FY2018, given that MMSV is dependent on the end customer\u2019s products. \u201cIf there is a major change, we can get more business but if there are minor changes, less. Still, we expect 2019 to be a very good year for us as there will be a major change in the features of smartphones. We will start working on this in the second half of this year and we may even have a chance to invoice some of the new orders in the fourth quarter of 2018.\u201d MMSV has a total of 15 customers in the smart devices, automotive and general lighting segments, seven of which are major customers. The largest is a multinational lighting company headquartered in the Netherlands. For FY2018, the group projects 40% of its revenue to come from smart devices, 30% from original equipment manufacturing (OEM),15% from general lighting and around 15% from automotive. \u201cIn the OEM segment, we build as per the customers\u2019 designs for their brands. The customers are mainly from the lighting or semiconductor industry but most of their products end up in smart devices. I would say our smart device and automotive segments generally deliver higher margins of about 10% to 15%,\u201d explains Sia. He also points out that 60% of the group\u2019s revenue is ringgit-denominated. \u201cAbout 40% of our collection is in US dollars but we also buy components in US dollars with 20% of our costs in the greenback. So, the net effect is around 20% to our bottom line.\u201d To stay lean, the group does outsourcing. \u201cWe outsource around 95% of our production and fabrication functions so that we don\u2019t have much fixed overheads. The major expenses for us include the cost of hiring good and qualified design engineers. This is one of the main challenges we face, apart from vying for new orders,\u201d says Sia. It is worth noting that MMSV\u2019s lean balance sheet showed a net cash position of RM33.15 million as at Dec 31, 2017, with no borrowings. Since FY2014, the group has been paying its shareholders a two-sen dividend annually with the payout ratio maintained in excess of 30% in the last three financial years. Analysts have started to notice the group\u2019s progress. Maybank IB Research initiated coverage of MMSV in March and has a \u201cbuy\u201d call on it with a target price of RM2.02. \u201cThough its clientele base and earnings potential are comparable to that of its closest peer, Elsoft Research, MMSV\u2019s current valuation pales in comparison at FY2019 price-earnings of just 8.4 times compared with 15.9 times for Elsoft. \u201cIts transfer to the Main Market should nevertheless serve to enhance its visibility among institutional investors and narrow this valuation gap. MMSV\u2019s attractive valuation also makes it a potential mergers and acquisitions target,\u201d the research house says. MMSV\u2019s share price of RM1.42 as at last Thursday translates into a market capitalisation of RM227 million. The stock has regained some ground since falling to a low of RM1.10 on April 4, slipping in tandem with other tech stocks after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd \u2014 the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker and a key partner of Apple Inc \u2014 guided weaker-than-expected sales amid softer demand for smartphones. Even so, Apple Inc\u2019s 16% revenue growth in its second quarter ended March 31 on the back of its new iPhone X indicates continued robust demand for strong product innovation. \u00a0"}, "115": {"date_posted": "14May2018", "title": "Markets optimistic about new government", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: While an unprecedented change in government after 61 years under the same alliance has left many feeling jittery, any initial sell-off on the local bourse as the market opens today is expected to be cushioned by optimism over the prospects of the Malaysian economy under a new administration led by the seventh Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad. In fact, the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) yesterday expressed optimism about the long-term prospects of the Malaysian economy under the new government. \u201cThe EPF anticipates that any potential short-term market dips would provide opportunities for further investments in the domestic markets,\u201d the retirement savings fund said in a statement. Meanwhile, Finance Minister-designate Lim Guan Eng sought to allay fears, saying the new government has \u201csteady hands\u201d to handle any market volatility. Analysts contacted by The Edge Financial Daily said that there may be little to no knee-jerk sell-off on Bursa Malaysia today as renewed demand from both local institutions and foreign investors push share prices up. Much of this optimism hinges on Dr Mahathir\u2019s pledge to keep the stock market buoyant, saying that his administration will remain business-friendly and that \u201cthere is no cause to devalue the ringgit\u201d. Most market observers do not consider his words empty talk, especially with the new Council of Elders introduced on Saturday that will advise the new administration on economic and financial matters over its first 100 days. The council comprises former Bank Negara Malaysia governor Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akthar Aziz, former finance minister Tun Daim Zainuddin, former Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) president and chief executive officer Tan Sri Hassan Marican, businessman Robert Kuok Hock Nien and economist Professor Dr Jomo Kwame Sundaram. Dr Mahathir also announced Guan Eng\u2019s appointment as finance minister, as well as Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin as home affairs minister and Mohamad Sabu as defence minister. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about a knee-jerk reaction before, but the appointment of the council is like saying \u2018enter the dragon\u2019. I don\u2019t think there will be any selldown at all come Monday,\u201d said Kenny Yee, head of research at Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd. Yee added not only will stocks linked to some of the council members\u2019 benefit, but that most counters should prosper as the team\u2019s expertise is expected to be a catalyst for Malaysia\u2019s overall economic growth. Even if there is a drop in the FBM KLCI upon the opening bell, most analysts do not expect it to be sizeable. \u201cThe index may fall between 50 and 100 points [on Monday], but it should close above 1,800 points,\u201d according to TA Securities Holdings Bhd technical analyst Stephen Soo, who referenced the FBM KLCI\u2019s 200-day moving average of 1,795 points. In fact, Soo believed that any intraday decline would easily be offset within the week. \u201cThere were some undercurrents [last] Tuesday that suggested insiders may have gauged a coming rally,\u201d he said. In fact, any dip could be a buying opportunity, Yee said. Soo shared the same view, saying, \u201cI would be buying [on Monday],\u201d adding that any dip would likely cause investors to experience some short-term pain, but long-term gain if they hold on to their counters. It is difficult, however, to know what the opening bell may bring. \u201cLocals will react positively but foreigners are not going to be very happy,\u201d shared the chief investment officer (CIO) of a local financial institution. However, he noted that local institutions are likely to provide support to the market. Foreign participation stood at 25.02% of Bursa Malaysia\u2019s total value traded as at April 2018, according to the stock exchange\u2019s statistics. Another supporting factor is Pakatan Harapan\u2019s emphasis on ridding its administration of corruption, which just might do the trick in wooing foreign investors, said the CIO. \u201cIt suits the sustainability agenda, which is big in the West,\u201d he said, adding that an improvement in governance at the federal level could trickle down to corporations. \u00a0 Counters to watch Stocks that could be in focus over the upcoming weeks stretch from politically linked counters and those that are heavily dependent on government contracts to the construction sector and safe-haven defensives. First to fall could be those in which the Umno has a direct stake, namely Utusan Melayu (Malaysia) Bhd (49.77%) and KUB Malaysia Bhd (52.17% held via Anchorscape Sdn Bhd). Anchorscape is partially controlled by Umno politician Datuk Abdul Rahman Mohd Redza. Star Media Group Bhd, in which the MCA is the largest shareholder (42.46%), is also on the line as only one MCA candidate, deputy president Datuk Seri\u00a0 Dr Wee Ka Siong, retained his parliamentary seat in the 14th general election (GE14). Other politically connected stocks that may take a hit are George Kent (Malaysia) Bhd, Johan Holdings Bhd and Destini Bhd. The first two are led by Tan Sri Tan Kay Hock and third by Datuk Rozabil Abdul Rahman. Tan is said to be well known in political circles while Rozabil, who is Destini chief executive officer and largest shareholder with a 25.4% stake, is reportedly the Umno Perlis treasurer. Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd is another counter worth watching, after Tan Sri Shahrir Abdul Samad, the chairman of largest shareholder the Federal Land Development Authority, lost his parliamentary seat in Johor Baru. Meanwhile, companies with family links to politicians could also see some action. These include Petra Energy Bhd, where Datuk Mohamed Nizam Abdul Razak, brother of the former prime minister, is the non-executive director and fourth-largest shareholder (9.11%). On the other side of the fence, investors have already flocked towards Opcom Holdings Bhd, which is led by Tan Sri Mokhzani Mahathir and controlled by his brother and newly appointed Menteri Besar of Kedah Datuk Seri Mukhriz Mahathir. Share prices in Eden Inc Bhd and Thriven Global Bhd, which are linked to the son of Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, Datuk Fakhri Yassin Mahiaddin, also picked up days before the election. Meanwhile, companies linked to Kuok who controls conglomerate PPB Group Bhd (50.81%), Shangri-La Hotels (Malaysia) Bhd (23.03%) and Malaysian Bulk Carriers Bhd (with a total 48.46% stake via two separate vehicles), could also see some action. Other prominent corporate figures whose companies may be in the spotlight include Tan Sri Lee Kim Yew, chairman of Country Heights Holdings Bhd, who was among the first of corporate figures to publicly congratulate Pakatan for its victory. Tan Sri Vincent Tan and Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Al-Bulkhary are also said to be close to the new prime minister. One more company investors would be focusing on when the market opens is My EG Services Bhd (MyEG), whose earnings are heavily reliant on government contracts. A foreign research house factored in a 15% downside risk to MyEG if the goods and services tax is abolished as promised, since the group has a contract to monitor the implementation of the tax system. The loss of net profit from the non-renewal of e-government contracts is much smaller at 6%, the report said. \u00a0 Consumer, construction, banking in focus Last Friday, CLSA Global Research, Maybank Investment Bank Research, CIMB Research, and RHB Research Institute shared positive views on the consumer sector but were cautious about the construction companies, following Pakatan\u2019s pledge to review all mega infrastructure projects. Construction stocks will be in focus as major infrastructure projects such as the East Coast Rail Line and the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail (HSR) are expected to be reviewed by the new government. The promise to improve transparency and governance could also lead to a slower pace of investment outlays in the short- and medium term, said CIMB Research. \u201cAmong stocks under our coverage, we believe the top losers are Gamuda Bhd (for its extensive tender exposure to mass rapid transit 3, HSR and highway concessions), YTL Corp Bhd (for its exposure to HSR and Gemas-Johor Baru rail double tracking), Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (for its exposure to HSR and Eastern Dispersal Link), Protasco Bhd (for its exposure to government road maintenance and housing projects) and IJM Corp Bhd (for its exposure to highways and rail contracts),\u201d it said in a note last Thursday. Views were mixed on the banking sector, which has seen several counters surging to all-time highs recently. CLSA downgraded banking stocks, pending clarity on policies, and was bearish on CIMB Group Bhd in particular as it holds a \u201cperceived link\u201d to the Barisan Nasional administration due to group chairman Datuk Seri Nazir Razak being the brother of former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak. Moody\u2019s Investor Service also cautioned that increasing risks of capital outflows and a further weakening of the ringgit could stress operating conditions for Malaysian banks in a last Friday note. However, a fund manager with a local insurance outfit said that the banking sector should still be supported by the fundamental factor of strong economic growth. Since the dissolution of Parliament on April 6, the FBM KLCI surged to an all-time high of 1,880.49 points on April 19, up 43.38 points from 1,837.01 points on April 6. This rise was also influenced by global factors such as commodity gains and easing trade war fears between China and the US. The benchmark index then lost as much as 2.86% to decline to 1,828.2 points on May 7, influenced by a rise in US treasury yields, before reversing to end up 1% 1,846.51 points the evening before polling day. \u00a0"}, "116": {"date_posted": "10May2018", "title": "iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF recovers from previous day's slump", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (May 10): The performance of iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF improved by 6.8% today to US$33.35, after slumping 9% yesterday to US$31.23 \u2014 its lowest level since December last year following the announcement of Pakatan Harapan's victory in the 14th general election yesterday.

Over at Sarawak-based construction company Zecon Bhd, a block of three million shares was traded in a single off-market deal at 59 sen each or RM1.77 million in total on April 20. According to a filing with Bursa, the buyer was group managing director Datuk Zainal Abidin Ahmad, who increased his stake via the married deal.

Chuah\u2019s acquisition raises his stake to 3.44 million shares or 6.88%. He was appointed to the board on April 13 and held 2.44 million shares at the time. On April 20, Central Industrial Corp completed its bonus share issue, which saw 40 million bonus shares approved and listed by the stock exchange. \u00a0 \u00a0"}, "118": {"date_posted": "8May2018", "title": "Market up ahead of 'mother of all elections'", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (May 8): Malaysian stocks closed higher today as market participants gear up for the 14th General Election tomorrow, billed as the \"mother of all elections\".

Meanwhile, Frank Lin, a dealer's representative at Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd, opined that the reversed trend today could be due to the general public sentiment that \"the incumbent government or Barisan Nasional will have the upper hand\". \"Buyers are probably anticipating that there won't be any change in GE14,\" he said, adding that there could be a possibility that local funds or local institutions also played a role in supporting the market.

What is at stake? On Wednesday (May 9), the incumbent Barisan Nasional (BN) government led by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, will take on opposition coalition Pakatan Harapan, led by former PM Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad. Dr Mahathir, Malaysia\u2019s longest serving PM, is bent on ousting Najib owing to 1Malaysia Development Bhd\u2019s (1MDB) financial scandal which has reverberated worldwide and tarnished the country\u2019s reputation. If his coalition wins, Dr Mahathir has promised a thorough investigation into the state-owned development fund\u2019s dealings and to charge those found complicit in any wrongdoing. Ahead of the \u201cmother of all elections\u201d, investors have been watching closely as the tension builds up, with many of them sitting on the sidelines. Consequently, the FBM KLCI has only gained a marginal 3.4% year to date (YTD) while the FBM Small Cap Index has fallen 14.1% over the same period. RHB Research Institute head of research Alexander Chia pointed to the perceived political risk as a key factor contributing to the divergence in the stock market performance for small- and big-cap stocks. Rakuten Trade vice-president of research Vincent Lau is of the view that the selldown in the small-cap space has created a buying opportunity for investors and traders. \u201cI think it\u2019s impossible to time the market accurately and say that the market will run up once the election is over or vice versa. \u201cBut fundamentally, some of these companies have strong growth prospects, but their share prices have been on a downtrend since the beginning of the year as the market is cautious,\u201d Lau said, adding that valuations are attractive. Regardless of who wins, the market will rebound if the fundamentals and earnings growth remain intact, he said, especially when the incumbent prevails, ensuring a status quo. \u00a0 The most likely outcome: BN to retain a simple majority win This view is in line with surveys conducted by independent pollster Merdeka Centre, which expects the incumbent to maintain power although Pakatan has made gains and will likely win the popular vote.Likewise, most investment analysts and fund managers take a simple majority win by BN as the base case. AllianceDBS Research head Bernard Ching said in his market report last Friday that investors will refocus on fundamentals again post-GE14 if the incumbent remains in power, and that there is a potential for a 6% gain should the benchmark index hit 1,950 points by year end. \u201cWithout predicting the election outcome, our base case assumes that the status quo will be maintained which will see the election overhang ease post-GE14 as investors focus on fundamentals again. Against the backdrop of sustained economic growth, we expect the Malaysian equity market to resume its upward trajectory and reiterate our end-2018 [FBM] KLCI target of 1,950,\u201d Ching said. He added that laggard mid- and small-cap stocks will likely be rerated given attractive valuations (below one standard deviation of its price-to-book of 0.8 times) and when investors regain their risk appetite. In the event the incumbent performs better in GE14 than in GE13, the stock market could see a stronger rally as political risk would subside. However, FXTM global head of currency strategy and market research Jameel Ahmad believes there will be some risk aversion heading into election day. Notably, while most market observers are expecting a base-case scenario, concerns about whether the Malay votes would swing to Pakatan remain. A \u201cMalay tsunami\u201d could see an unprecedented win by the opposition. \u00a0 The worst-case scenario: a hung parliament In March, The Edge Malaysia weekly raised four possible scenarios: BN to retain its simple majority, a bigger majority win for BN (presumably two-thirds), a hung parliament and a surprise Pakatan victory. Of these possibilities, most analysts agree that the worst case would be a hung parliament as most investors would pull their money out of the market to wait out the uncertainties. Ching said the \u201celection is expected to be fiercely contested with [a] status quo being the base case while the worst case is a hung parliament leading to protracted uncertainty and risk aversion\u201d. An analyst declining to be named said a hung parliament could see the FBM KLCI drop by 200 to 300 points or 10% to 16% from the current levels. \u201cInvestors will want to stay on the sidelines to see how the events will turn out as there are too many possibilities. PAS\u2019 (Islamic party) kingmaker gambit will be a possibility if that happens and we could even see defections to other parties. There will be concerns about the effectiveness of the government to function if that happens,\u201d he added. Thus far, neither Invoke nor Merdeka Centre anticipate a hung parliament although Invoke predicts Negeri Sembilan and Melaka will be hung states with equal representation from BN and Pakatan in the state assemblies. \u00a0 Beyond the general election While GE14\u2019s outcome could influence the stock market, Jameel observes that the election is but one event that could impact the stock market. \u201cInvestors across the globe will be monitoring the recent commencement of trade talks between the US and China with a very close eye. It is not thought that these negotiations will be straightforward and any suggestions that there will be a breakdown in talks between two of the largest economies in the world can impact risk appetite. If investors are less attracted towards taking on risk, there would also be less attraction towards the Malaysian stock market as a result of less risk appetite,\u201d he said. Other than the external environment, there are also key domestic events which could affect the stock market even if GE14 pans out as expected. In a report, Maybank Investment Bank (Maybank IB) director and head of research for Malaysia equity markets Wong Chew Hann highlights two key macro decisions in May following GE14 \u2014 Bank Negara Malaysia\u2019s (BNM) monetary policy statement on Thursday and the release of the gross domestic product (GDP) numbers for the first quarter of the year. She has projected the overnight policy rate would remain at 3.25% for the rest of 2018 and that GDP growth at 5.3% this year. In March, BNM raised its GDP growth forecast to between 5.5% and 6% from an initial 5% to 5.5%.Wong also noted the peak of first-quarter corporate results to be released in the last two weeks of May. Maybank IB Research has a 2018 FBM KLCI target of 1,880 based on 16 times, 12-month forward price-earnings ratio. DBS Bank senior economist Irvin Seah also believes that beyond the election and political uncertainties, Malaysia has made significant progress over the year in ensuring growth stability and fiscal sustainability. \u201cThe implementation of economic transformation strategies as well as continuity of many of its more progressive policies will be crucial to its longer-term outlook. Both internal and external stakeholders will be looking to the next government in this respect,\u201d he said in a report last Friday."}, "120": {"date_posted": "4May2018", "title": "KLCI down 0.38% as key banks drag", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (May 4): The FBM KLCI fell 0.38% at midday break today, in line with the retreat at most regional markets, dragged by key banking stocks.

JCorp president and chief executive Datuk Kamaruzzaman Abu Kassim said the flotation exercise would involve both the upstream and downstream businesses of QSR which operates the Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and Pizza Hut restaurant chains. He pegged QSR\u2019s market value upon listing at an estimated RM6 billion. \u201cThe listing was widely rumoured last year, but it didn\u2019t happen due to certain circumstances. As soon as the group is ready, we will make further necessary announcements,\u201d Kamaruzzaman said at a media briefing yesterday on JCorp\u2019s financial performance last year. JCorp is the investment arm of the Johor state. The Edge Malaysia weekly previously reported that work on the IPO had started as early as 2016 and that QSR had picked Maybank Investment Bank as the principal adviser. One of the reasons cited for the delay in the listing was Thai Beverage PCL\u2019s reported interest in acquiring a substantial stake in the KFC and Pizza Hut businesses in Malaysia. However, JCorp indicated yesterday that the talks had been preliminary, and that there had been no further discussions. Given the proposed IPO, Kamaruzzaman said all other options have been \u201cput on the back burner\u201d. The listing would allow\u00a0 QSR\u2019s other shareholders \u2014 the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and private equity firm CVC Capital Partners \u2014 an opportunity to exit their investment, although the extent of their selldown would depend on the details of the IPO. QSR has a network of restaurants throughout Asean, with a total of 1,268 Pizza Hut and KFC outlets across Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia and Brunei. The quick-service restaurant group had previously been listed on Bursa Malaysia but in 2012, JCorp, together with the EPF and CVC, took KFC Holdings (M) Bhd and its parent QSR Brands Bhd private in a RM5.2 billion deal that was completed in early 2013. In a statement yesterday, JCorp described its financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY17) performance as steady, driven by all segments \u2014 property, specialist healthcare, plantations, food and restaurant services, as well as industry development divisions. In FY17, the group reported a 31% increase in profit after tax to RM542 million from RM415 million in FY16, while its revenue rose 4.1% to RM5.58 billion from RM5.36 billion. JCorp said this did not include QSR\u2019s revenue, which amounted to RM4.56 billion in FY17. As for its healthcare unit KPJ Healthcare Bhd, JCorp said: \u201cKPJ has plans to expand its healthcare services with a mission of setting up hospitals in every major district in Johor and ambulatory care centres near major cities in the country.\u201d KPJ Healthcare posted a revenue in excess of RM3 billion last year, and JCorp expects its performance to be maintained."}, "122": {"date_posted": "2May2018", "title": "Dividend yields trending higher ", "article": " DIVIDEND yields have been on the rise, so it is not that difficult a task to find a stock with a yield above 5%. Yields have been rising since the recent stock market rout , which hit mid to small-cap counters especially hard. Now could be a good time to nibble on dividend stocks with a good track record of regular payments and high earnings visibility. \u201cIn a weak stock market cycle, it could be worth paying attention to shares that pay good dividends. When share prices are not going up and you cannot sell them at a profit, the only recourse is to hold onto shares that provide good dividends. This way, you would at least have a steady stream of income,\u201d says Inter-Pacific Securities head of research Pong Teng Siew. Areca Capital CEO Danny Wong opines that low share prices and rising yields give investors a better entry point. But yields are only one part of the equation and investors should also take into account the inverse relationship between share price and dividend yield. When share prices rebound, yields will drop, unless these companies are raising their dividend payments. The sustainability of dividend payments and yields, says Pong, hinges on the companies\u2019 business prospects. \u201cIf business slows down and earnings become weaker, it is natural for dividend per share to decline,\u201d he says, adding that if a company\u2019s earnings are growing, the current yields would not be a good yardstick. \u201cYou have to do your homework, paying attention to whether a company\u2019s higher dividend for the year was due to a one-off bonus because it sold off some assets or if the bottom line has improved,\u201d Poh says. To a certain extent, historical dividend yield may come in handy for investors to separate the wheat from the chaff. A typical dividend stock, says Wong, has steady earnings and dividends are doled out on a regular basis, for example, firms that have a dividend policy. Gearing is another indicator to watch out for when evaluating a company\u2019s ability to pay out regular dividends. A highly geared firm may not be in as strong a position as one in a net cash position, simply because the former incurs interest expenses that eat into cash flow. \u00a0 High yields from unexpected counters Many would expect real estate investment trusts (REITs) to head the list of high-yield counters. Interestingly, Tambun Indah Land Bhd topped the list of companies with a market capitalisation of RM300 million or more (based on April 16 closing prices), with a dividend yield of 13.2%. However, the Penang-based developer\u2019s total dividend per share (DPS) of 7.7 sen declared for the financial year ended Dec 31 (FY2017)\u00a0 was lower than the 10 sen paid out in FY2016. Notably, its revenue and net profit for FY2017 were lower \u2014 RM282.01 million and RM83.39 million respectively \u2014 than the previous year. The increase in dividend yield is mainly due to the 22% drop in its share price since the beginning of the year. It has halved from last year\u2019s peak of RM1.42 per share in mid-May. Apart from Tambun Indah, Tong Herr Resources Bhd and Star Media Group Bhd were also at the top with dividend yields of above 10%. Tong Herr\u2019s yield is 11.8% based on the 36 sen DPS proposed for FY2017. The stainless steel fastener manufacturer\u2019s revenue was up 21% while net profit climbed 27% for FY2017. Despite the better earnings performance, its share price took a beating, declining 22% since the start of the year to RM3.05 as at April 16. Star Media\u2019s indicated dividend yield is 11%. In FY2017, shareholders were delighted to receive a total DPS of 42 sen, which included a 30 sen bumper dividend following the disposal of Singapore-listed Cityneon Holdings Ltd. Excluding the bumper dividend, the group\u2019s DPS was 12 sen. Based on the past three years, the media group doled out dividends of 18 sen per share. The company remains in a net cash position of RM377.76 million as at Dec 31, 2017. But in terms of share price, the publisher of the best-selling English daily suffered a decline of 31.6% between Jan 2 and April 16. It closed April 16 at RM1.09 per share. It is worth noting that among the top 55 companies with high dividend yields, only nine firms\u2019 share prices have risen so far this year. They include Malayan Banking Bhd, SHL Consolidated Bhd, Boustead Plantations Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd, Atlan Holdings Bhd, UOA Development Bhd, Matrix Concepts Holdings Bhd, ELK-Desa Resources Bhd and Paramount Corp Bhd. The-one-time market darling dividend stock, British American Tobacco (M) Bhd, saw its yield rise to 7.2% as its share price plunged close to 40% to RM23.34 on April 16 from Jan 2. The market cap of the tobacco company has been reduced to RM6.66 billion. Another sin stock that is on the list is Berjaya Sports Toto Bhd,\u00a0 with a yield of 7.2%. The share price of the number forecast operator, however, has been resilient, declining only 2.2% since the beginning of the year. But, compared with a year ago, the counter has declined 20.6%. It closed April 16 at RM2.09 per share. \u00a0"}, "123": {"date_posted": "30April2018", "title": "1Q earnings season to see shift in winners and losers", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: When they turn in their quarterly results for the first three months of this year (1Q18), publicly traded companies are likely to report better earnings compared with 4Q17, say analysts. That performance, however, will be selective rather than broad-based. UOB Kay Hian Malaysia head of research Vincent Khoo expects 1Q18 corporate earnings to be \u201cless downbeat\u201d compared with 4Q17, growing in the \u201chigh single digits\u201d year-on-year (y-o-y). He estimates that companies on Bursa Malaysia would post profit growth of more than 8% for all of 2018. According to Rakuten Trade vice-president of research Vincent Lau, the winners and losers would have shifted this earnings season amid a change in the economic environment compared with a year ago. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of changes [in 1Q18]. Crude oil prices have risen significantly along with the ringgit and there were other external concerns such as the US trade sanctions, which could have hurt earnings of export-oriented industries. All these changes will impact corporate earnings whether in a positive or negative way,\u201d Lau told The Edge Financial Daily. \u201cThus, earnings growth is likely to be selective rather than broad-based in the near term,\u201d he said, noting that companies that have reported their 1Q18 earnings to date have been within analyst expectations. \u00a0 Semiconductor firms hit by stronger ringgit, weak demand Over the last one-and-a-half years, the local currency has appreciated by 12.85% to RM3.9195 against the greenback and is one of the best-performing currencies so far. Benefiting from the weak ringgit in the past few years, technology companies, particularly semiconductor players, are, however, likely to see a reversal in their earnings growth in 1Q18 due to the strengthening ringgit. Inter-Pacific Securities research head Pong Teng Siew noted that the outlook for the semiconductor sector has also dampened amid weaker smartphone sales globally. Semiconductor equipment maker Unisem (M) Bhd saw its net profit fall 86.5% y-o-y in its first quarter of financial year 2018 (1QFY18) ended March 31, 2018, to RM6.05 million, largely due to a RM9.95 million foreign exchange (forex) loss. Year to date, Unisem shares have dropped 50.3%, wiping out some RM1.35 billion off its market value, to close at RM1.82 last Friday, with a market capitalisation of RM1.33 billion. MIDF Research head Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman said the fortunes of semiconductor equipment makers like Unisem will hinge on the performance of outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) and electronics manufacturing services (EMS) companies such as Inari Amertron Bhd, going forward. \u201cThe performance of the semiconductor equipment makers depends on the orders placed by the OSAT and EMS providers,\u201d Mohd Redza added. Still, while there has been a negative shift in analysts\u2019 consensus view on the semiconductor industry, Globetronics Technology Bhd beat the odds, kicking off the new financial year with net profit more than tripling to RM15.19 million in its 1QFY18 from RM4.67 million a year ago. Affin Hwang Investment Bank analyst Kevin Low is maintaining his \u201cbuy\u201d call on Globetronics\u2019 stock, forecasting the company to deliver a robust 67% earnings growth in 2018 once the production volume of light sensors normalised in the second half of this year in tandem with its client\u2019s new smartphone model launches. Analysts will be monitoring the impact of the forex loss on semiconductor players and whether the increase in capacity and volume could offset the negative. Perhaps, like what Mohd Redza said, the industry\u2019s outlook will be clearer when Inari\u2019s 3QFY18 financial results ended March 31, 2018, are announced on May 16. Rakuten Trade\u2019s Lau pointed out that despite the possibility of weaker results, the recent decline in most of the semiconductors\u2019 share prices indicates that most of the negatives would have been priced in. \u201cI think valuation at current level is quite decent and has taken into consideration the short-term negatives for the industry,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, Inter-Pacific Securities\u2019 Pong pointed out that small-cap stocks have not been performing well after a stellar 16% rally last year as earnings have been hurt by an increase in raw material costs. The FTSE Bursa Malaysia Small Cap Index has dropped 14% this year. And while its big-cap counterparts are growing, it is at a slower pace than what has been seen in the past, he added. This earnings season has so far shown that of the 60 companies that have reported their quarterly results, about 37% recorded growth, 30% saw declines and 20% or 12 companies slipped into losses. And of the 60 companies, only 13 posted double-digit net profit growth and 8% or five companies managed to return to the black. Among the heavyweights that will be announcing their results next month include Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank), Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd and IHH Healthcare Bhd. \u00a0 Worst over for O&G companies Rising oil prices have supported the strengthening ringgit. The oil price was trading at US$74.64 (RM292.59) per barrel last Friday, up from its one-year low of US$47.15 per barrel. It is worth noting that the current oil price is even higher than the average US$52 per barrel projected in the country\u2019s Budget 2018. While industry experts remain cautious over the sustainability of the oil price at current levels, many believe that the oil and gas (O&G) sector has bottomed out. Pong said the impairment cycle in the O&G sector is already at its peak end, suggesting the worst is over. But while expectations are high for O&G companies to chart better performances on the back of improved crude oil prices and stronger contract flows, they have yet to materialise. \u201cThere is still a big overhang of assets that was built during the low end of the cycle and these assets are competing for jobs and with so many idle assets, they still fetch relatively poor charter and contract rates,\u201d Pong said, adding that this makes it tough for listed O&G companies to report strong pickup in profits. For Mohd Redza, he believes \u201cthe worst is over\u201d for loss-making Sapura Energy Bhd and expects the group to return to the black in its FY19 ending Jan 31, 2019. Sapura Energy\u2019s share price has declined by 66.6% over the past year to close at 67.5 sen last Friday from RM2.02 on May 2, 2017. It lost RM8.05 billion in market value during this period. Nevertheless, Mohd Redza cautioned against the risk coming from the Middle East, ie, a possible change in the Iran nuclear deal for the O&G sector. \u201cIf there is a plan to resolve the Iran issue in an amicable manner, then we will see a more stable oil price.\u201d Mohd Redza opines that the oil price will trade in the range of US$60 to US$65 per barrel due to incoming supply from Russia. Rakuten Trade\u2019s Lau, who is also positive on a recovery in the O&G sector, noted that the cash premium on 380-cst fuel oil soared to the highest recently since May last year, suggesting a surge in demand. \u201cCompanies such as Straits Inter Logistics Bhd are likely to continue to see the continuation of growth this year. Of course, it is unlikely to repeat the strong growth as what was seen in previous financial year as it was coming from a low base last year. Nonetheless, we are positive about its earnings in the coming quarter,\u201d Lau said. Straits Inter Logistics\u2019 net profit surged more than 52 times to RM2.5 million last year. It will report its financial results for the March quarter in mid-May. \u00a0 Financial and consumer sectors to be big winners The consumer and financial sectors are set to be big winners this earnings season, but analysts see limited upside to their share prices as they are currently trading at relatively high valuations. \u201cWe have to wait for earnings to pick up strongly and this will come through the lower raw material cost or when productivity increases,\u201d Inter-Pacific Securities\u2019 Pong said. Food and beverage giant Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd is currently trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio (PER) of 50.2 times. The three largest banks \u2014 Maybank, CIMB and Public Bank Bhd \u2014 are trading at a trailing PER of between 14 times and 16 times. While the consumer sentiment index is still below the 100-level threshold, it continues to be on an uptrend. Mohd Redza views that demand will remain backed by domestic consumption, which will support earnings for the consumer sector. It is worth noting that Nestle\u2019s 1QFY18\u2019s net profit edged higher by 0.2% to RM231.2 million. Dutch Lady Milk Industries Bhd also recorded a growth of 7.2% in its net profit to RM34.2 million in its 1QFY18. The stronger ringgit is also going to provide support to consumer counters, especially domestic-driven companies such as Berjaya Food Bhd, Hup Seng Industries Bhd, Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd, Heineken Malaysia Bhd and Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd. But UOB Kay Hian\u2019s Khoo pointed out that textile and furniture makers could face a more difficult time on the back of a stronger local currency. As for banks, Mohd Redza said they will continue to do well, especially CIMB and Maybank, as both are expecting recovery from their operations in Indonesia. \u00a0 Earnings from infra-related jobs to kick in Inter-Pacific Securities\u2019 Pong said with earnings from some of the earlier announced infrastructure-related projects likely to begin kicking in; investors will start paying attention to the construction sector again. He, however, noted investors\u2019 hesitance to invest in construction stocks as they usually do not provide consistent and stable returns in the long term. Mohd Redza believes construction stocks are worth looking out for after the 14th general election, pending announcement of the award of the East Coast Rail Link and the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail projects. He is expecting small- to mid-cap construction companies such as Gabungan AQRS Bhd to benefit from these awards. UOB Kay Hian\u2019s Khoo concurred, saying construction companies are expected to see strong growth in their upcoming earnings results, given the low base of 2017. On April 19, Vizione Holdings Bhd, which recently ventured into the construction sector following the acquisition of Wira Syukur (M) Sdn Bhd, saw its net profit for its 3QFY18 ended Feb 28, 2018 jump by 53 times y-o-y to RM8.06 million. \u00a0 Property counters to see slight recovery Although the increase in overnight policy rate (OPR) by 25 basis points in January has caused higher monthly payment for housing loans, which in return affected property sales, Mohd Redza opined that the property sector will see recovery this year. \u201cPeople will get used to it (OPR hike) and they will buy houses again. It (recovery) looks to be imminent,\u201d he said, adding that there are still some good take-up rates for projects with good locations in the Klang Valley. Mohd Redza expects Mah Sing Group Bhd to report gains in first-quarter earnings as it clears up its unsold units and increases its sales. Looking at the property companies that have just released their 1Q18 earnings, some have seen a turnaround story with others recording double-digit growth. EUPE Corp Bhd reported the fourth consecutive quarter of profit for its 4QFY18 ended Feb 28, 2018, with a net profit of RM2.1 million compared to a net loss of RM4.4 million in 4QFY17. EcoFirst Consolidated Bhd also saw its net profit for its 3QFY18 ended Feb 28, 2018 jump 3.5 times y-o-y to RM4.5 million. Another property-related industry \u2014 the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector \u2014 is also expected to see a pickup this year. According to Mohd Redza, while earnings growth is likely to be low, a stable rental reversion of about 2% to 3% is expected and given the stable distribution income, Malaysian REITs appear to be good options for investors with a long-term investment horizon. A few trusts to take note are Pavillion REIT, IGB REIT and Axis REIT, which saw y-o-y increases in their net property income for 1Q18 of 13%, 6.7% and 6% respectively. \u00a0 Recovery in sight for auto and telecom sectors The automotive industry, which has been facing a difficult time in the last few years, is also another sector that will benefit from the strengthening ringgit. Affin Hwang auto analyst Brian Yeoh said auto players should see a recovery in their earnings on the back of the strengthening ringgit. \u201cA slightly higher total industry volume (TIV) will help earnings improve. As most auto companies import their cars and components in US dollars or the yen, the stronger ringgit will help their earnings,\u201d he added. The Malaysian Automotive Association is forecasting TIV to grow by 2.3% to 590,000 this year. This is after a second year of decline in new vehicle sales in 2017. UOB Kay Hian\u2019s Khoo is also of the view that the stronger ringgit will help auto counters record better performance this earnings season. However, Cycle & Carriage Bintang Bhd started its 1QFY18 in the red as the group continued to see its margin hurt by a demand shift to lower-priced models. It recorded a net loss of RM2.7 million in 1QFY18, compared to a net profit of RM312,000 a year ago. This was despite Mercedes-Benz Malaysia recording its best-ever first-quarter sales, which registered a 13.2% y-o-y sales growth to 3,335 vehicles. Tan Chong Motor Holdings Bhd is expected to release its first-quarter results next week, while UMW Holdings Bhd and DRB-Hicom Bhd are likely to post their earnings results towards the end of May. Other than the auto players, Mohd Redza pointed out that the telecommunication companies are going to benefit from the stronger ringgit and a turnaround is expected for most of them. Among the telecom heavyweights, both Maxis Bhd and DiGi.Com Bhd saw improvements in net profit for their respective 1QFY18. Maxis saw a y-o-y increase of 4.18% to RM523 million from RM502 million a year ago, while DiGi\u2019s net profit was up 3.48% at RM386.11 million versus RM373.11 million in its 1QFY17. Fundsupermart.com said telecom counters are poised for a marginal rebound as seen from both the performances of Maxis and DiGi due to the low base effect and the easing price war among telecom players. Last year, telcos saw a negative earnings revision of about 2.8%. In his note on April 20, Jerry Lee Chee Yeong at Fundsupermart.com pointed that there was a focus shift among telcos from pricing to consumer experience as the telcos seeked to defend their average revenue per user. \u201cHence, given that price war among telcos is possible to abate this year, we believe it will somehow benefit the telecom sector as a whole,\u201d he said."}, "124": {"date_posted": "27April2018", "title": "Maybank upgrades ViTrox to hold ", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (April 27): Maybank Kim Eng analyst Ivan Yap upgraded the recommendation on ViTrox Corp Bhd to hold from sell. * Price target (PT) set to RM5, implies 1.8% decrease.

Charon, from Khazanah Nasional Bhd, is understood to have tendered his resignation recently as executive director in the managing director\u2019s office \u2014 a position he has held since November 2013 \u2014 and as managing director of Khazanah Research Institute (KRI). KRI, in a statement issued to The Edge last Friday, confirmed that Charon is leaving, by mid-May. Charon had previously been with CIMB Group Holdings Bhd for nine years, the last two as the CEO of its investment banking subsidiary, CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. \u201cHe has the backing of PNB, but his appointment at MIDF will ultimately depend on Bank Negara Malaysia,\u201d an industry source tells The Edge. If approved, Charon will replace Datuk Mohd Najib Abdullah, MIDF\u2019s group managing director and CEO of the investment banking subsidiary, MIDF Amanah Investment Bank Bhd. He is tipped to take on both the latter\u2019s roles. Mohd Najib, 58, has held the group managing director\u2019s post for almost 12 years \u2014 since July 2006 \u2014 and is said to want to retire. \u201cMohd Najib was to have retired when his contract, which comes up for renewal every two years, ended last year. He\u2019s staying on until they find a replacement,\u201d says another industry source. When contacted, MIDF declined to comment. \u201cAs a matter of corporate policy, we do not comment on rumours or speculation in the market,\u201d it said via email. Charon could not immediately be reached for comment. Set up 58 years ago as the country\u2019s maiden DFI, MIDF\u2019s role was to ensure access to financing for local manufacturing-based companies. It has since transformed into a more diversified group with its key businesses today being investment banking, development finance and asset management. The expected change in leadership raises an interesting question on what PNB\u2019s long-term game plan is for the DFI. It is known that MIDF has been seeking an Islamic banking licence and is understood to be engaging with the central bank on the matter. MIDF, once a listed entity before PNB took it private in 2007, is already doing some Islamic financing but there are limits to what it can do without a licence. It cannot collect retail deposits, for example \u2014 one of the cheaper sources of funding for regular banks. MIDF is understood to be keen on taking the M&A route to clinch a licence. Back in 2015, it had tried to acquire Asian Finance Bank Bhd (AFB) for the latter\u2019s Islamic banking licence. However, it failed to strike a deal due to valuation issues. AFB was later acquired by Malaysia Building Society Bhd in a RM644.95 million deal. In February last year, Mohd Najib told reporters that MIDF was on the lookout for M&A targets as it was seeking entry into the retail banking segment. He said the group would assess opportunities and hoped to make a decision within the next 18 to 24 months. There are currently 16 Islamic lenders in Malaysia, including foreign ones like Kuwait Finance House Malaysia Bhd. MIDF is relatively small, with total assets of RM6.62 billion as at end-September last year. Apart from MIDF, PNB \u2014 the country\u2019s largest fund manager \u2014 also owns a 48% stake in Malayan Banking Bhd and 59% equity interest in national reinsurer MNRB Holdings Bhd. A merger between Maybank Islamic Bhd and MIDF is highly unlikely if the latter wants to remain a standalone bank, analysts say. PNB chairman Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Abdul Omar had last year acknowledged that an Islamic banking licence and a return to the stock market are possibilities for MIDF as part of the fund\u2019s larger plan to support the promotion of Islamic financial services in Malaysia. \u201cWe have to have a new financial model, a new proposition altogether. So, this is currently being thought about,\u201d Abdul Wahid was reported as saying in a business daily last August. In the last five years, MIDF\u2019s net profit peaked at RM131.68 million in FY2013 before trending downwards. Net profit came in at RM117.61 million in FY2014, RM106.91 million in FY2015 and RM91.58 million in FY2016. It has yet to publicly release its financial results for FY2017. For the first nine months, however, it reported a 9.9% decline in net profit to RM40.52 million. The group\u2019s earnings are driven mainly by the investment banking business. In FY2016, the business accounted for 60% of its profit. The asset management business has been loss-making. As at 9M2017, it incurred a loss of RM148,000. Analysts say the injection of fresh blood at MIDF could be a positive development for the group, but they believe it will be a tough task growing it sustainably in the long run, given that it is a small player in the increasingly competitive financial services landscape, where capital requirements are also getting more onerous. If appointed to MIDF, it would mark Charon\u2019s return to active banking. When he officially left CIMB Group in November 2013, he was the group deputy CEO of investment banking and CEO of CIMB Investment Bank. Two months later, Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Aziz joined CIMB Group from Malayan Banking Bhd, replacing Charon, and later became the group CEO. Charon was appointed the founding managing director of KRI, a not-for-profit organisation sponsored by Khazanah, on Jan 20, 2014. KRI, in its statement, said an announcement on Charon\u2019s successor would be made in due course. In the meantime, the KRI board of trustees has set up an executive committee to oversee operations. \u00a0"}, "126": {"date_posted": "23April2018", "title": "Maybank may trend higher, says RHB Retail Research ", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (April 23): RHB Retail Research said Malayan Banking Bhd may trend higher after it formed another white candle and breached above the RM10.60 threshold.

Target operational date remains to be end-calendar year 2018 (CY18). We believe that the stock is fairly valued now with its near-term earnings potential largely priced in. Our earnings forecasts, \u201chold\u201d call, and TP of RM1.44 (27.6 times CY19 price-earnings ratio, peer average) are maintained. Contrary to its original plan of building a new RTE facility near its distribution centre in Rawang, Mynews has decided to house it at its warehouse cum office building in Kota Damansara, which it acquired at end of fourth quarter of CY17. We understand that the piece of vacant land in Rawang (60,000 sq ft) will instead be considered for expansion of its distribution centre in the medium term. We note that Mynews will be moving into its 50,000 sq ft office in Kota Damansara by June 2018. By end-CY18, the RTE facility (estimated 100,000 sq ft) should be operational. As per its previous plan, Mynews targets to roll out food supplies to 150 stores in financial year 2019 (FY19). Having opened 10 stores in first quarter of FY18 (1QFY18) (total store count: 366), store openings would have to be ramped up to meet its internal target of 90 for FY18 (FY17: 62). We model in 75 store openings for FY18 as we view management\u2019s target to be rather aggressive. Mynews targets to maintain the geographical mix of 80:20 between the central region and other parts of Malaysia. Elsewhere, it has launched a loyalty/gift card and it will be rolled out to all stores by end-April 2018. Capital expenditure (capex) in FY18 is estimated to be higher at RM100 million (FY17: RM21 million) largely due to the set-up of its RTE facility, new office block, store refurbishments, and new store openings. We expect Mynews to maintain its net cash position into FY18-FY19 partly due to proceeds from its private placement (RM77.5 million, completed on Oct 25, 2017).

More than a handful of local brokerages contacted by The Edge Financial Daily yesterday said that they had yet to implement a system to offer IDSS to investors. Responses to when short selling would be made available ranged from \u201cvery soon\u201d to as early as next month. \u201cThere\u2019s no rush [to allow IDSS] if brokerages don\u2019t see much commercial gain from it,\u201d said an executive with a local stockbroking firm. A remisier with a local investment bank highlighted that brokerages may need time to implement guidelines that would ensure adequate checks and balances. One of his concerns included ensuring all intraday short positions can be closed before the end of the trading day. According to Pong Teng Siew, head of research at Inter-Pacific Securities Sdn Bhd, the change of computer systems to accommodate IDSS would take a significant amount of time. However, certain trading houses may already have systems supporting short selling in place. \u201cThere\u2019s been no confirmation from management yet, but it shouldn\u2019t take that long as we are among the larger banks that already have a system in place for controlled short selling,\u201d a remisier who declined to be named told The Edge Financial Daily. Prior to the introduction of IDSS, Bursa Malaysia permitted regulated short selling (RSS), which was limited to licensed proprietary traders only. As a result of the Asian financial crisis, short selling was banned on Sept 5, 1997. RSS, starting with only 100 stocks, was reintroduced in 2007. On Monday, the stock exchange regulator announced that 280 securities had been made available for short selling, a list that will be reviewed every six months. Apart from including all 30 FBM KLCI constituent stocks, the eligible stocks are mostly large and midsized capitalisation stocks, with the smallest counters having a market value of no less than RM200 million. A high average trading volume and liquidity are fundamental to stocks that are listed for short selling, explained a remisier who declined to be named. On top of that, short selling of small-cap stocks makes them prone to excessive speculation, he added. The move to allow IDSS was announced by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak on Feb 6 at the World Capital Market Symposium. \u201cThis measure is part of the exchange\u2019s strategy to boost market liquidity and further improve flexibility for market participants to refine their trading and risk management strategies,\u201d said Bursa chief executive officer Datuk Seri Tajuddin Atan said in a statement on Monday. Bursa said market controls for IDSS include a suspension of short selling if a stock\u2019s price falls by more than 15% from the previous day\u2019s closing price, or if the gross short selling volume exceeds the daily maximum limit of 3% of outstanding shares per security. On top of that, Securities Commission Malaysia chairman Tan Sri Ranjit Ajit Singh has stressed that naked short selling \u2014 done without borrowed scripts \u2014 is not allowed. \u00a0 Education needed for retail investors Most brokers shared that they have yet to see significant investor interest in IDSS, despite the measure having been announced months ago. \u201cWith any new product, what is needed is the education of investors,\u201d said Woon See Soon, senior general manager at Mercury Securities Sdn Bhd, which offers IDSS. Frank Lin, a dealer\u2019s representative at Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd (HLIB), said that they are typically matured and sophisticated investors who engage in short selling, whereas retail investors prefer to take a longer position on counters. \u201cMarket demand [on Bursa Malaysia] is still confined to narrower trading strategies,\u201d he said. Both HLIB and Inter-Pacific Securities have yet to offer IDSS.

The placement shares will be placed out to third party investor(s) to be identified, and the actual issue price will be determined and announced later.

Just last week, the company made a number of material announcements. Mid-week, Sapura Energy announced that it had suffered a net loss of RM2.5 billion on revenue of RM5.89 billion in its financial year ended Jan 31, 2018 (FY2018). However, the bleeding was largely due to an impairment loss of a whopping RM2.1 billion on its drilling rig business. The results saw the company\u2019s share price crumble, plunging 13.8% from its close on Tuesday to a day\u2019s low of 47 sen on Wednesday afternoon. It is worth noting that Sapura Energy had a similar impairment loss in FY2016, when it was known as SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd, due to a low oil price environment. Nevertheless, a day after announcing its FY2018 results, the company announced that a consortium in which it has a 30% stake had outbid six other outfits for exploration rights at Block 30 in Sureste Basin, a proven and prolific hydrocarbon province in the Gulf of Mexico. PublicInvest Research says while it is too early to assess the financial impact of the award at this juncture, it is undoubtedly positive and solidifies the group\u2019s longer-term prospects, particularly when crude oil prices look likely to remain above US$60 per barrel. Also last week, Sapura Energy announced its first foray into New Zealand with a series of farm-in agreements on five offshore exploration permits in the oil and gas region of the Taranaki Basin. These announcements come on the back of the company securing an engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning contract for the Pegaga Development Project from Mubadala Petroleum. The job is to be undertaken at the offshore integrated central gas processing platform facility in Block SK320 in the offshore waters of Sarawak. While no details are available, the contract is estimated to be worth RM1.8 billion. Since early this year, Sapura Energy has secured RM2.7 billion worth of new orders in the service segment, nudging its order book to RM16.6 billion. The orders are seen to contribute to its FY2019 financials. Another potential catalyst for the group is the planned listing of its energy arm. CIMB Research analyst Raymond Yap says in a note that assuming a valuation of RM6 billion and Sapura Energy selling a 30% stake in its energy arm, the proceeds will be RM1.8 billion, which can be used to repay the group\u2019s debts and ensure that it has minimal debt repayments until FY2023. \u201cThis should ease the concerns of many investors we have spoken to,\u201d Yap adds. As at Jan 31 this year, Sapura Energy had cash and cash equivalents of RM1.72 billion while on the other side of the balance sheet, it had long-term debt commitments of RM14.69 billion and short-term borrowings of 1.72 billion. But is the worst over for Sapura Energy? Institutional investors, such as the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) (KWAP) and AmanahRaya Trustees Bhd-Amanah Saham Bumiputera (ASB), a unit of Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB), have been actively trading Sapura Energy\u2019s stock after the company released its latest results. While the EPF seems to have sold a considerable amount of its holding, from 11.24% on Jan 2 to 6.38% on March 22, KWAP has pared its holding only marginally to 7.19% from 7.25% in mid-January. ASB\u2019s holding stands at 6.46%, down from 6.73% in mid-December last year. Maybank IB Research analyst Liaw Thong Jung says the impairment loss on Sapura Energy\u2019s drilling assets will save RM160 million per annum in depreciation from FY2019. \u201cThat will be offset by lower drilling asset utilisation on flattish daily charter rates. The E&C (engineering and construction) operation should see moderate recovery from FY2020,\u201d he says in a note to investors. MIDF Research analyst Aaron Tan says he sees Sapura Energy turning the corner. \u201cWe expect the group to return to the black in FY2019. A chunk of the group\u2019s earnings will stem from the upbeat offshore activity levels of the E&C segment and higher crude oil prices of the exploration and production (E&P) segment,\u201d he says in a note. Crude oil prices have appreciated 5% year to date, reaching around US$70 last Friday, which is a boon for oil and gas companies, including Sapura Energy. According to Bloomberg, 13 out of the 16 analysts covering the stock have a \u201cbuy\u201d call on it. Maybank\u2019s Liaw has a \u201cbuy\u201d call on the stock and a target price of RM1.20 while MIDF\u2019s Tan, who also recommends a \u201cbuy\u201d, has a target price of RM1.01. CIMB\u2019s Yap has an \u201cadd\u201d call on Sapura Energy and a target price of 89 sen while Public Invest Research has a \u201ctrading buy\u201d and a target price of RM1.11. However, not everyone is bullish on Sapura Energy. AffinHwang Capital reiterates its \u201csell\u201d call for now because it believes the outlook for the company remains challenging for a couple more quarters before E&C activity picks up. \u201cWhile its order book is higher at RM16.6 billion, the impact on earnings may likely be felt later on when E&C activity picks up. Net gearing rose from 1.26 times to 1.56 times quarter on quarter as a result of the impairment loss,\u201d the research house says. Sapura\u2019s share price has declined 70.3% since the beginning of the year. It closed at 54.5 sen last Friday, giving the company a market capitalisation of RM3.27 billion. \u00a0"}, "133": {"date_posted": "6April2018", "title": "White Horse aims to increase export volume", "article": " White Horse Bhd\n(April 4, RM1.89)\nMaintain hold with a target price (TP) of RM1.84: White Horse is the largest ceramic tile manufacturer in Malaysia with a market share of about 31%. Earnings prospects are still largely determined by the residential/commercial property cycle, which remains in a cyclical downturn. That said, we expect White Horse earnings to bottom out in financial year 2018 (FY18) before gradually picking up from FY19 as supply and demand rebalances in the residential/commercial sector. We estimate local industry tile capacity at about 105 million sq m of which White Horse\u00a0 is the market leader with a 31% market share. It operates 20 production lines across its manufacturing facilities in both Malaysia (15 lines) and Vietnam (five lines) with 28 million sq m and 12.65 million sq m capacity respectively. Through continuous upgrades to its machinery, White Horse has the capability to manufacture a full range of tiles such as ceramic wall and floor tiles, homogenous and glazed porcelain and multi-effect tiles. White Horse is heavily dependent on the residential/commercial property sector to drive overall tile industry demand and average selling price growth. Given that the bulk of its sales is domestic (FY17: 71%), this makes it vulnerable to the current subdued property market. However, we believe White Horse\u2019s operations in Vietnam may improve in FY18 on the back of positive economic factors which could mitigate further earnings downside moving forward. Further, White Horse also plans to increase its export volume in the light of soft domestic demand. As such, we forecast flattish revenue growth of -1% for FY18E and positive 3% revenue growth per year in FY19E/FY20E alongside an expected gradual recovery in the property market. Our FY18E forecasts also imply a 7% year-on-year fall in core net profit. We initiate coverage with \u201chold\u201d and a TP of RM1.84 based on FY18 price-to-book value (PBV) of 0.57 times (1SD below its historical 12M forward PBV mean). Despite our expectations for weaker earnings in FY18E, we believe the stock has bottomed and will find support from its market leading position to aid its recovery when the cycle turns.

With a total return to shareholders \u2014 encompassing share price gains and dividends reinvested \u2014 of 38.55% over the past 10 years, UMW\u2019s performance was not great compared with other PNB counters, but it was not too shabby either. Of course, it is nowhere near CCM Duopharma Biotech Bhd, one of the country\u2019s leading pharmaceuticals manufacturers, or PNB\u2019s crown jewel Malayan Banking Bhd, the country\u2019s largest lender by assets. Both investments have proven lucrative \u2014 giving the fund returns of more than 100% over the past 10 years. However, UMW\u2019s performance in terms of total returns at least has fared better than other PNB investee companies such as Sime Darby Bhd and MNRB Holdings Bhd. Bloomberg data shows that before its demerger exercise at the end of last year, Sime Darby had delivered returns of 14.36% to its shareholders over the previous 10 years while reinsurer MNRB Holdings had chalked up returns of 5.24%. Recall that UMW had a great financial year 2012 ended Dec 31, attaining RM2 billion in profit before tax mainly owing to record sales in its automotive division. But the slump in crude oil prices that started in mid-2014 coupled with the depreciation of the ringgit against the US dollar that affected its automotive sector resulted in the group slipping into the red in 2015 with a net loss of RM37.2 million. Though in a loss-making position in 2015, UMW paid out dividends albeit at a lower rate compared to prior years. The total dividend per share declared was 20 sen, a drastic fall from the 50 sen given out in 2012. The dividend was also lower than Sime Darby\u2019s 25 sen in the same year. UMW\u2019s dividend yield fell from 5.79% in 2012 to 2.07% in 2015. Prior to slipping into the red, UMW had kept its dividend payout ratio at between 57.7% and 76.1% from 2008 to 2014. The group has not declared dividends for the past two financial years, which did not sit well with shareholders chasing dividend gains. UMW\u2019s returns are lower than that of other automotive players such as DRB-Hicom Bhd, which owns a 50.1% stake in national carmaker Proton, and the country\u2019s largest Mercedes-Benz dealer Cycle & Carriage Bintang Bhd. Over the past 10 years, DRB delivered returns of 156.51% while Cycle & Carriage made 116.57%. Note, however, that it might not be fair to compare UMW with DRB-Hicom as the latter is a more diversified group with interests in logistics, property, financial services and construction. UMW\u2019s returns are also lower than that of its target acquiree MBM Resources Bhd, which delivered total returns of 58.49% to its shareholders over the past 10 years. Nevertheless, the announcement of the proposed takeover seems to have got the market excited over UMW\u2019s prospects. RHB Research in a March 12 note upgraded the stock to a \u201cbuy\u201d from a \u201csell\u201d, with a target price of RM6.91. \u201c[MBM\u2019s] Daihatsu and Hino distribution franchises would broaden UMW\u2019s commercial vehicle offerings, given their focus on small- and mid-sized trucks. \u201cWe do not expect any objections from UMW\u2019s key principal, Toyota, given that Daihatsu and Hino are already key companies within the Toyota Motor Group. MBM Resources\u2019 autoparts business would also fit in seamlessly with UMW\u2019s manufacturing and engineering division. The new ownership structure could also offer more supply contract opportunities for MBM Resources\u2019 troubled alloy wheel manufacturing business,\u201d RHB Research says. MIDF Research in a March 14 note was equally positive about the deal. \u201cWhile we expect an initial share price pressure given the potential cash call to fund the acquisitions, we suggest investors buy into UMW as it would be a good deal if it is successful, given UMW\u2019s potentially cheap entry into MBM at just eight times FY19F earnings and effective 6% to 7% dividend yield attained from Perodua at the entry price,\u201d the firm says.

Our neighbour, Singapore, too has its own woes and \u2026 fines. When it comes to fiscal discipline, however, Malaysia has much to learn from the city state. It is easy to dismiss Singapore \u2014 with a land mass of 721.5 sq km and population of 5.6 million \u2014 as a much easier place to govern. By comparison, Penang island is 299 sq km and has a population of about 750,000. Including Seberang Perai, the state has a land mass that is 45% larger than Singapore\u2019s but a population of only 1.75 million or just under a third of the city state\u2019s. The latter means that Singapore needs to be highly efficient and creative when it comes to land use and future-proofing its economy to remain a respected and highly developed independent nation. Unlike Malaysia, which is blessed with an abundance of natural resources, Singapore has very good reason to be kiasu and kiasi \u2014 the colloquial speak for being afraid of losing out (overly competitive) and being afraid of doing something wrong (premature death). Singapore, which separated from Malaysia in August 1965 and still buys water from our country, achieved self-reliance in water in 2016 even as supply in several states here was hit by drought. And even as Malaysia racked up debt of over RM687 billion by spending more than we earn \u2014 during both the good times and the tough times the past two decades \u2014 Singapore prudently accumulated reserves from its budget surpluses as well as its ability to invest and grow its war chest (a secret number of over S$1 trillion [RM2.96 trillion]). Singapore\u2019s annual budget began enjoying what it calls a Net Investment Return Contribution (NIRC) from 2000, government data shows. Apart from up to 50% of net investment returns from GIC Pte Ltd, Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore\u2019s NIRC also comprises up to 50% of net investment income from past reserves and remaining net assets. What was a mere S$2.29 billion (1.4% of gross domestic product) at the turn of the millennium grew to S$7.35 billion (2.2% of GDP) in 2010 and reached S$14.61 billion last year. Now the largest contributor to Singapore\u2019s budget, the NIRC is expected to reach a new all-time high of S$15.85 billion or 3.4% of GDP this year, which covers nearly 20% of government expenditure. \u201cSingapore has self-imposed strict fiscal rules to prevent the government from spending beyond its means,\u201d says Chua Hak Bin, senior economist at Maybank Kim Eng Research. \u201cFirst, the Singapore government cannot run a fiscal deficit (it must be balanced or surplus) over each term of government (within each electoral cycle). Second, Singapore sets aside all land sales into reserves, which are then invested to generate future returns. For FY2017, land sales amounted to S$12.9 billion, a considerable sum,\u201d he adds, relating how proceeds from land sales in Hong Kong flow directly into budget revenue and are spent. \u201cThird, only up to half of the net investment return from reserves (with GIC, Temasek and MAS) can be drawn upon for the budget. The rest will be ploughed back into reserves and reinvested,\u201d says Chua, who reckons that Malaysia \u201cwill be hard-pressed to adhere to a balanced budget rule, given rising spending needs and sensitivity of fiscal revenue to energy prices\u201d despite a broadened revenue base. Singapore had tapped on past reserves (US$4.5 billion during the 2008 global financial crisis) but special permission from the president \u2014 not the prime minister \u2014 is necessary. The government also does not borrow to fund its annual budget and has no net debt, according to data on its Ministry of Finance\u2019s website. \u201c[Malaysia] ran a budget deficit for the last 20 years, hence the lack of reserves for investment to have an NIRC \u2026 The amount contributed by Khazanah [Nasional Bhd] in terms of dividend is relatively small by comparison,\u201d another seasoned economist surmises. Khazanah paid RM500 million in dividend in 2016 and RM1 billion last year while Bank Negara Malaysia paid RM3 billion in dividend in 2016 and RM2.5 billion last year, official data shows. National oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) paid RM16 billion in 2016 and 2017 and has committed to pay RM19 billion this year. \u201cA strategic case can be made that some proportion of Petronas\u2019 dividends should be set aside and accumulated in a sovereign wealth fund, which is to be invested in external assets. Recycling Malaysia\u2019s oil profits and reserves into more oil and gas and domestic assets only concentrates the investment risk on Malaysia\u2019s economic cycle, oil prices and the ringgit [and the] purpose of setting reserves aside is so that the government can tap on these funds when there is a sharp economic downturn, which often coincides with a collapse in the ringgit or oil prices,\u201d says Chua. \u201cThe ideal type of fiscal reserves should, therefore, not be correlated with Malaysia\u2019s economic or stock market cycle, oil prices or the ringgit. It is an insurance against a crisis.\u201d As it is, dividends from Petronas, Bank Negara and Khazanah form part of the interest and returns on investment under the federal government\u2019s non-tax revenue but their contributions pale in comparison with debt service charges of RM26.48 billion in 2016, RM28.87 billion in 2017 and the RM30.88 billion expected for 2018. \u201cWhile the Malaysian government has committed to fiscal discipline and the progressive reduction in fiscal deficit, there is a general lack of political will to bring its high operating expenditure down to a more manageable level. A bloated civil servant population, high expenditure on their remunerations and a pension scheme that is unsustainable are examples. While efforts have been made to cut subsidies, it appears to have found its way back gradually to the government budget,\u201d the seasoned economist laments. \u00a0 How can the government budget better? \u201c[Malaysia needs to] contain the civil servant population, focus on the productivity and efficiency of government services, restructure the pension scheme to one that is self-sustaining, implement a transparent open tender system of awarding government contracts and optimise government revenue by removing duplicating incentives (that would also cut down abuses),\u201d says the seasoned economist. While Singapore\u2019s decision to raise the Goods and Services Tax (GST) by 2% to 9% by 2021 would provide Malaysia with headroom to move its 6% rate higher, economists reckon that the government still needs to manage its finances better by bringing down operating expenditure and leaving room for more development spending (without relying on debt) to grow the economy. \u201cThe ability to bring about higher labour productivity and income for the population that translates into higher standards of living is important. Otherwise, the rising cost of living would be a real constraint on the low to middle-income groups \u2026 The other factor to consider is the ability to bring profiteering of traders under better control so that it does not spill over into higher inflation unnecessarily,\u201d the economist says. That\u2019s important given that our government \u201cmay have to plan and prepare for growing liabilities from public-sector pensions and healthcare spending from an ageing demographic (which fortunately, comes at a later time for Malaysia versus Singapore or Thailand), as the existing fiscal revenue sources will likely not be sufficient\u201d, says Chua, who reckons that the Malaysian government \u201cmay have to look into future and new revenue sources to finance these needs\u201d. He believes that Malaysia \u201cmay want to see how it can consolidate and reduce the number of exemptions within the GST framework first [as well as on e-commerce goods and imported services] before raising the GST. Otherwise, consumers will be even more tempted to switch to internet shopping to escape the GST net\u201d. Noting that Singapore has been introducing more \u201cwealth taxes\u201d on property and personal income to make the overall system more progressive and to fund social transfers to the lower income group, Chua reckons that Malaysia may also want to make the property tax system \u201cmore progressive\u201d to bolster its revenue options or sell land to bolster its reserves. \u201cLand is, however, also a state matter and often the main revenue source for some states. Rights over the proceeds from land sales may, therefore, not be as straightforward as Singapore\u2019s case. \u201cSingapore\u2019s strong fiscal standing has earned the government an AAA credit rating (which is shrinking in terms of the number of qualified countries) and strengthened the Singapore dollar over the years. Strengthening Malaysia\u2019s fiscal and savings discipline would also raise Malaysia\u2019s credit standing and the ringgit\u2019s longer-term resilience,\u201d says Chua. Malaysia\u2019s self-imposed 55% debt-to-GDP ceiling and zero deficit targets will lead to some discipline but he reckons \u201cfurther fiscal discipline might be necessary to keep government guarantees and borrowings via government-linked entities in check\u201d. \u00a0 Building a case for the future \u201cThe Malaysian government has made significant progress so far in the rationalisation of its expenditure. Further efforts in rationalising expenditure would be helpful, such as making subsidies more targeted, right-sizing the civil service and improving healthcare, education and transport service cost recovery,\u201d says AMRO (Asean + 3 Macroeconomic Research Office) chief economist Khor Hoe Ee, who notes how Singapore\u2019s government has managed to anticipate the large increases in the coming years and \u201chas the resources to tackle the challenge\u201d of ageing and technological changes. \u201cThe past few [Singapore] budgets in particular have put great emphasis on ageing-related spending, with more financial support for senior citizens, such as the Silver Support Scheme and the Pioneer Generation Package. They have also provided all residents with Medishield Life with universal coverage \u2026 In terms of labour shortage due to the ageing population, the government is also looking for ways to reduce man\u00adpower demand, while enabling older workers to continue to contribute to the society meaningfully \u2026 In the past few years, each of Singapore\u2019s annual budgets was built on the previous budgets to embrace technological changes,\u201d Khor adds. It would seem that a bit more kiasuism may be necessary this side of the Causeway. Freedom from a persistent budget deficit would allow Malaysia\u2019s attention to move further, beyond covering operating expenses and immediate needs to focus more on catering for impending structural changes and the future needs of the people and the economy. \u00a0  Click / Tap image to enlarge \u00a0"}, "141": {"date_posted": "15March2018", "title": "Cover Story: Will [email\u00a0protected] revive interest in RHB Bank\u2019s shares? ", "article": " MOST active investors would know that RHB Bank Bhd has one of the cheapest valuations among banking stocks. Indeed, its attractive valuation is often cited as a good reason to invest in its shares. The sector trades at an average price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.26 times. Public Bank Bhd has the highest P/B ratio of 2.36 times while RHB Bank\u2019s stands at 0.93 times. As at last Thursday, RHB Bank\u2019s share price had gained 8% over a one-year period \u2014 on a par with Alliance Bank (M) Bhd but ahead of AMMB Holdings Bhd (-14.24%) and Affin Bank Bhd (-3.6%). Over the same period, Hong Leong Bank Bhd saw a significant rise in its share price (+49.05%), followed by CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (+45.81%), Malayan Banking Bhd (+26.4%) and Public Bank (+16.63%). Interestingly, RHB Bank unveiled its new five-year plan \u2014 [email\u00a0protected] \u2014 last week, realigning its vision with Malaysia as its core market while focusing on its strength overseas and building a winning operating model through digital transformation. The question is, are a new five-year plan and cheap valuation enough to attract investors to the mid-size banking group? Analysts whom The Edge spoke to were lukewarm about [email\u00a0protected], though they agreed that transforming digitally is a must for banks these days. Some saw [email\u00a0protected] as a continuation of the banking group\u2019s previous plan, which focused on the affluent and small and medium enterprise segments. \u201cI\u2019m holding back my optimism about the plan. I need to see earnings flow through first under this new plan. They had embarked on transformation before but it didn\u2019t really help with earnings,\u201d said MIDF analyst Imran Yassin Yusof. He pointed out that net interest income growth of 2% in FY2017 was decent but not exciting. An analyst who declined to be named opined that going digital was something banks had to do these days to capture more business. At the same time, it would cut transaction cost and save operating expense, he said. \u201cBut until I can see what is really different in terms of operating model from its peers\u2019, I won\u2019t be too excited about it.\u201d RHB Bank\u2019s quest to grow its SME segment would make it one of the many banks that are trying to penetrate the segment, which was previously seen as the domain of Public Bank and Alliance Bank. \u201cThe SME pie is big. Besides, there is ancillary income to be made from the segment, like cash management and other services provided to this group of entrepreneurs,\u201d said Imran. According to analysts, though the risk profile of the SME segment is high, with good credit management and being selective, it is a lucrative market for banks because of the high yields it offers. RHB Bank has been successful in growing its SME business with its share of the market rising to 9% last year from 8.7% in 2015. In FY2017, the banking group\u2019s SME loan growth stood at 8.8%, ahead of the industry\u2019s 6.3%. Under [email\u00a0protected], the banking group will be concentrating on the home market, unlike before under IGNITE 2017 when it targeted a 20% profit contribution from its overseas operations by 2020. While commending the bank for looking to strengthen its domestic business, analysts believe it is also important for it to capture growth overseas. \u201cI guess they are being conservative, given that they have been hit by impairment losses for their exposure to oil and gas in Singapore,\u201d commented an analyst. RHB Bank\u2019s overseas operations as a whole were in the red in FY2017. Group managing director Datuk Khairussaleh Ramli, though, is hopeful that the segment will at least break even this year. The banking group\u2019s net profit rose 16% year on year to RM1.95 billion in FY2017. This was thanks to a 5% growth in its net fund-based income, especially Islamic, a 28.3% decline in loan-loss impairment and 19.6% decrease in impairment losses on other assets. Its loan growth of 3.7% fell short of the industry average of 4.1% due to a slowdown in overseas loans. Meanwhile, gross impaired loans improved to 2.2% in FY2017 compared with 2.4% in FY2016. \u201cWe continue to expect the group\u2019s asset quality to gradually improve. This is premised on the trend of firmer commodity prices while the group\u2019s gross impaired loan ratio is showing signs of improvement. Meanwhile, the pipeline for IB (investment banking) deals is healthy. A stronger execution of the deals will improve its non-interest income. Also, valuation continues to remain attractive, trading at 0.9 times to our FY2018F book value/share,\u201d says AmInvestment Bank Research.

A key gauge of world stock markets slipped on Wednesday after a strong advocate of free trade resigned from the White House, fanning fears that U.S. President Donald Trump will proceed with protectionist tariffs and risk a global trade war, according to Reuters. But the U.S. dollar recovered most of its overnight losses as some investors wagered that even with the departure of Trump's chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, the president's hard talk could be a tactic amid ongoing trade negotiations with Canada and Mexico, it said.

AllianceDBS Research in ite evening edition Wednesday said the FBM KLCI had on March 7 fallen below the 1,840 level to reach a low of 1,834.66 as market participants chose to play on the selling side in anticipation of a lower market. It said under the persistent selling pressure, the benchmark index was in the red throughout most of the trading sessions before settling at 1,837.90 (down 10.47 points or 0.57%). \u201cIn the broader market, losers outnumbered gainers with 991 stocks ending lower and 163 stocks finishing higher.

AllianceDBS Research said the marker saw selling activity on March 7 with the benchmark index breaking below the 1,840 level. \u201cMarket participants apparently were keen to play a selling game given a choice to trade the market. \u201cOn March 5, the market may have protected its fort at 1,840, but the inability on the part of the market to stage a much stronger rebound on March 6 gave rise a general view of an underlying weakness,\u201d it said.

And the mid- and small-cap counters are likely to join the party later to continue sustaining the momentum, barring any unforeseen circumstances. A third of the FBM KLCI stocks are currently trading at or near their record highs. This month alone, more than 20% of the benchmark index\u2019s 30 counters hit all-time highs when the market resumed its strong run-up following a correction at the beginning of the month due to the sharp drop on Wall Street. Across the board on Bursa Malaysia, 49 companies were trading at or near their all-time highs last Friday, and 36 of them have a market capitalisation of RM1 billion and above. Malayan Banking Bhd, the largest by market capitalisation, touched its all-time high of RM10.26 that day, while Nestle (M) Bhd, the most expensive stock on the exchange in terms of absolute price, hit a fresh high of RM123. Public Bank Bhd, whose market capitalisation is the third largest on Bursa, also climbed to all-time high of RM22.80.\u00a0 PPB Group Bhd touched a new high of RM17.76 last Wednesday, before pulling back slightly to RM17.68 last Friday. Likewise, Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd and Hong Leong Bank Bhd were both trading at their all-time highs at the beginning of the month. The 3.6% gain on the FBM KLCI so far this year is the strongest for the January to February period since 2007 \u2014 the year before the onset of the global financial crisis \u2014 when it recorded a 9.1% gain. The gain could have been sharper if not for the correction caused by the big drop on Wall Street early in the month. In January, the index had gone up 3.99%, its eighth-highest monthly increase in the last 10 years. The upward trend on Bursa is not just among the component stocks of the FBM KLCI. A quick look at the 182 listed companies with a market capitalisation of more than RM1 billion showed that more than a fifth of them \u2014 41 companies \u2014 touched their all-time highs as recently as this year. They included Dutch Lady Milk Industries Bhd, Top Glove Corp Bhd, Bursa Malaysia Bhd, Heineken Malaysia Bhd, Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd, AirAsia Bhd and George Kent (M) Bhd. Areca Capital Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Danny Wong told The Edge Financial Daily that the gains among the big-cap stocks is a normal phenomenon. A rally in the equity market is usually led by the big-caps, followed by the small- and mid-caps eventually, according to him. \u201cThe initial stage of the rally will be led by the big-caps mainly because the [local] institutional investors and foreign funds come into the market. The rotation among the small-caps will follow suit as more positive news flow emerges,\u201d Wong said. He noticed that investors\u2019 risk appetite has returned after the selldown at the start of the month. The rally isn\u2019t only on Bursa as markets elsewhere also headed up. Singapore\u2019s Straits Time Index has gone up 3.83% year to date (YTD) to 3,533.22, which is not that far from its highest peak of 3,831.19 achieved in 2007. The Jakarta Composite Index has also gained 4.2% YTD to 6,619.804 after hitting its all-time high of 6,689.287 two weeks ago. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also resumed its upswing to reach 24,962.48 after a correction in early February upon hitting an all-time high of 26,616.71. \u00a0 Small-cap stocks to catch up In contrast, the FBM Small Cap Index dip by 0.13% YTD, reflecting the lack of interest in small-cap counters. But these stocks are expected to take the center stage later should the positive sentiment prevail. Vincent Lau, Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of research, said that a rotation into the bigger-cap players was seen at the beginning of this year, as reflected by the five-week correction seen among the small-cap players since Jan 9. \u201cWith the foreign investors buying in, the (FBM) KLCI has been on a strong uptrend. The smaller-cap has seen some corrections, probably after the run-up seen in the last two to three years. But with the bullish sentiment expected to continue ahead of the upcoming 14th general election (GE14) as well as the better earnings results, it is likely for the small-cap players to catch up,\u201d Lau said. He noted that the big-cap stocks have done well but reckoned that there are buckets of opportunities in the small-cap space, which has largely been ignored by the foreign funds so far. Meanwhile, based on the readings of the technical charts, RHB Retail Research commented last week that the bullish indicator had emerged suggesting that the FBM Small Cap Index will see more upside movements. Areca Capital\u2019s Wong concurs that small- and mid-cap players will catch up with the bigger-cap players as the positive sentiment continues. \u201cThe small- and mid-cap companies usually react more quickly to the positive news flow and development than the bigger-cap players,\u201d he noted. \u00a0 Is the market too far ahead of fundamentals? With the benchmark index not too far from its historical highest point and the big-cap stocks at record highs, it has prompted the investing fraternity to ponder whether the local market has reached its peak? Should investors jump on board before the bullet train embarks on the next leg of the rally? The fear of missing out is rising as the index heads further north. A look at the stock market valuation shows that the FBM KLCI is trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio of 17 times, which is in line with its five-year average although it is slightly higher than its 10-year average of 16.6 times. The FBM Emas Index, comprising large- and mid-cap constituents of the FBM 100 Index and FBM Small Cap Index, however was trading at a trailing PER of 18.6 times, which is higher than its five-year and 10-year average of 17.5 times and 16.2 times respectively. Wong pointed that the benchmark index does not look cheap now with high expectations of a stronger earnings to be seen for the upcoming results reporting season for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2017 (4Q17), considering the robust economic growth in 2017. \u201cIt\u2019s [valuation] not cheap but if the earnings in 4Q17 (fourth quarter 2017) and 1Q18 met expectations, it will be supportive of the market ... If not, then it\u2019ll be difficult for the momentum to continue given the [rather high] valuation of the (FBM) KLCI at the moment,\u201d Wong commented. Wong pointed that most of the banking companies have yet to announce their results except for Public Bank, which has edged slightly higher, and with banks\u2019 dominance in the FBM KLCI, it will be crucial for the results of the banking sector to perform to maintain the rally seen in the index.\u00a0 He noted that plantations have done relatively well and some of the blue-chip consumer stocks have seen a surge in earnings. Apart from the upcoming GE14 and external risks, analysts opine that corporate earnings are the one factor that will dictate the market direction given that the market have priced in quite decent growth."}, "145": {"date_posted": "23February2018", "title": "Top Glove hits record high of RM9.98", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 23): Top Glove Corp Bhd, which is trading at a price-earnings ratio of 34.15 times, rose to its all-time high earlier this morning.

The Edge Financial Daily takes a look at some of the results that have been announced so far in 2018 and whether the \u201cmissing growth\u201d in 2017 would now be seen. Based on the results reported as of Feb 15, the companies involved seem to have recorded an improvement in their bottom line although synchronised earnings growth remains to be seen. It is still early as more companies are expected to release their financial results after the lunar new year, but with 75 companies having registered year-on-year (y-o-y) profit growth as against 63 with declining earnings; things are definitely pointing towards an improvement. Bloomberg data shows that 21 companies or 67.7% out of 31 companies covered by analysts outperformed expectations. Nine others failed to meet expectations and one was in line with consensus target. Vizione Holdings Bhd is among the companies that have recorded significant y-o-y growth in quarterly earnings. After construction firm Wira Syukur (M) Sdn Bhd was injected into Vizione as part of a RM280 million reverse takeover exercise that was completed in October 2017, the group saw a significant increase in profit and revenue. For its second quarter ended Nov 30, 2017, net profit jumped by more than 46 times to RM6.55 million while revenue rose by close to 15 times to RM147.3 million. Similarly, jeweller Tomei Consolidated Bhd\u2019s net profit for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2017 (4QFY17) jumped by more than 19 times to RM4.4 million. The higher sales volume during year-end festivities had contributed to the better results. Not all the companies managed to record growth in both the bottom line and top line. Cocoa manufacturer Guan Chong Bhd, for instance, saw its 4QFY17 net profit rise by more than 11 times to RM30.8 million despite a 9.2% fall in revenue to RM493.8 million. The higher profit was due mainly to an improved margin and an unrealised gain from commodity future contracts previously. Lotte Chemical Titan Holdings Bhd, which endured a rather unfortunate start to its listing following some negative headlines last year, kicked off 2018 on a more positive note as its 4QFY17 net profit jumped 30% to RM378.2 million thanks to tax incentives. Its revenue was down 1.4% at RM2.12 billion. Of the 143 companies that have released their financial results so far in 2018, only about 20 were in the red. Cement producer Tasek Corp Bhd posted a net loss of RM5.94 million in 4QFY17, against a net profit of RM2.14 million a year ago. Similarly, housing developer Hua Yang Bhd recorded a net loss of RM0.96 million for the third quarter ended Dec 31, 2017 (3QFY18) as compared to a net profit of RM10.4 million in 3QFY17. \u00a0 Will the stronger ringgit hurt exporters? With the ringgit having strengthened by more than 10% against the US dollar over the past one year \u2014 to RM3.891 as of yesterday \u2014 there is a concern if exporters like glove manufacturers and semiconductor players could maintain their earnings growth. Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd (MPI) reported a 25% decline in its bottom line for the second quarter ended Dec 31, 2017 (2QFY18) due to a higher material cost arising from a commodity price surge and unfavourable foreign exchange difference. Following that, MPI\u2019s share price fell from RM11.24 to below RM9. Most analysts are of the view that earnings growth is crucial to keep the momentum in the domestic stock market, and if a company failed to meet expectations, price falls such as the one seen in MPI will not be a surprise. However, KESM Industries Bhd saw a 13.6% growth in net profit for the first quarter ended Oct 31, 2017 to RM11.4 million on higher demand for burn-in and testing services. Other semiconductor players such as Inari Amertron Bhd, Globetronics Technology Bhd, Unisem (M) Bhd and Vitrox Corp Bhd are expected to announce their quarterly results by Friday. As for glove manufacturers, Hartalega Holdings Bhd saw its net profit for 3QFY18 jump 70.7% to RM113.0 million in line with the higher revenue achieved on higher sales demand and improvements in production capacity as well as lower costs, thanks to improvements in operational efficiencies. Supermax Corp Bhd also saw its net profit rise 59.1% to RM35.9 million for 2QFY18. Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd is expected to announce its financial results by Friday. A fund manager with a local asset management firm said that while the ringgit\u2019s strength will have some impact on exporters\u2019 earnings moving forward, the efficiencies and capacity expansion seen in the last few years will keep the growth momentum for them. \u201cIf you look at those who will be most affected by a stronger ringgit, it should be the glove makers but they have continued to record growth in their earnings. We believe it\u2019s the same for the semiconductor players as there is more demand for chips, not only in smartphones but also in vehicles as well as our daily lives,\u201d he said. Affin Hwang Investment Bank Bhd chief economist and research head Alan Tan said in a Feb 12 report that the manufacturing sector in 2018 is expected to be supported by higher demand for electrical & electronic (E&E) products, with global semiconductor sales likely to remain strong. The Semiconductor Industry Association projected that the total global sales growth may exceed another US$400 billion (RM1.56 trillion) in 2018, after rising by 21.6% to US$412.2 billion in 2017, the industry\u2019s highest-ever annual sales, Tan said. He said the manufacturing sector output will recover in the first half of 2018, on expected higher demand from advanced economies, but with some seasonal distortions due to festive holidays in February. The optimism was despite weaker E&E exports in December 2017, where the growth in Malaysia slowed sharply from 21.2% y-o-y in November to 6.2% y-o-y in December, the first single-digit growth in six months, at the back of slower demand from the US, European Union and the Asean region. \u00a0 Sizable impairment could be over for O&G players After most oil and gas (O&G) companies suffered severe losses in the last few years following the oil price slump, investors are looking at survivors such as UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd, Sapura Energy Bhd and Barakah Offshore Petroleum. Sizable impairment is indeed something of the past for the industry. Sapura Energy\u2019s results for the third quarter ended Oct 31, 2017 have led to a downgrade by most analysts who are wary of a potential risk of impairment in the fourth quarter. Analysts also expect another round of impairment for UMW Oil & Gas in 4QFY17 to auditors\u2019 requirements. Following this impairment, analysts are expecting depreciation expense to fall in subsequent years for the company. MISC Bhd\u2019s 4QFY17 net profit tumbled 87.1% to RM68.2 million, mainly dragged by a higher impairment loss of RM553.9 million previously. This serves as a reminder that the industry\u2019s outlook may not be as smooth sailing as in the past. There was some optimism as brent crude oil touched a three-year high of US$70.53 per barrel in January. However, the price fell back after gushing US shale oil production threatened to drown an Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec)-led effort to clear a worldwide oil glut. It is currently trading at the US$65 level. Dialog Bhd, which is involved in the upstream, mid-stream as well as downstream businesses, has maintained its consistent positive results with 2QFY18 net profit up 26.7% to RM115.8 million. A fund manager told The Edge Financial Daily that earnings decline for O&G players are likely to moderate as most of the companies have worked towards a leaner cost structure and have done some kitchen-sinking exercises in 2015 and 2016, including asset impairments and conversion of short-term debt to long-term. Other efforts such as fleet rationalisation, labour force downsizing, renegotiations of terms with suppliers, as well as revamped internal operations have also been undertaken to improve efficiencies and cost savings. \u00a0 Consumer firms\u2019 earnings hit by rising costs Consumer firms have seen declining earnings over the past two years as most of them have absorbed the additional cost of doing business, such as higher raw material and transportation costs, in view of the weak sentiment in the past few years. The higher cost of doing business was mainly due to the weaker ringgit at the time. According to Bloomberg data, only six out of the 23 consumer players have recorded earnings growth in 4QFY17. This was despite the sales and revenue growth seen in more than half of these companies. Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd (F&N) is among the larger cap players that reported lower earnings. Its net profit for 1QFY18 fell 16.1% to RM106.83 million on higher sugar prices and lower volume, though these were partly offset by operational cost savings and lower overheads. Other companies such as Hup Seng Industries Bhd, Zhulian Corp Bhd and Pensonic Holdings Bhd had also seen declines in earnings during the quarter. TA Securities analyst Damia Othman said the late lunar new year festivities this year (compared to late January in 2017) had dampened the earnings recorded by F&N in 4QFY17, but net profit would improve going forward as commodity prices are seen to be falling, aided by a strengthening ringgit. On top of that, consumer stocks are expected to remain attractive as defensive picks, as long as they continue to pay high dividends, Damia told The Edge Financial Daily. An analyst covering the consumer sector said revenue growth is an indication that businesses continue to gain traction at a reduced margin. \u201cWith the CSI (Consumer Sentiment Index) showing improvements, it is likely to see margin recovery as business owners pass on the cost to end users or through cost savings from automation, synergy and other expansion,\u201d she said. The CSI rose 5.5 points in the 4Q to a two-year high of 82.6, according to the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research. This, said an analyst, was the result of higher household and current incomes as well as an expectation of more employment opportunities. \u00a0 No surprises from FBM KLCI Corporate earnings of FBM KLCI constituents appear to have fallen in line with consensus estimates so far, based on the reports of six out of 30 component stocks. Analysts have largely retained their \u201cneutral\u201d outlooks and \u201chold\u201d recommendations on most of the large cap counters. Maxis Bhd reported its highest profit after tax and minority interest of RM2.1 billion in four years for the year ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY17), which was still within expectations, according to Kenanga Research. DiGi.com Bhd, meanwhile, posted a 3.9% fall in 4QFY17 net profit to RM360.08 million, on higher finance costs but this came within consensus estimates and prompted a target price revision from CIMB Research to RM5.10 from RM5. Tenaga Nasional Bhd\u2019s net profit for the first quarter ended Nov 30, 2017 rose 24% to RM2.16 billion on the back of a stronger ringgit. CIMB Research, however, warned that the group\u2019s earnings growth may slow down going forward as electricity demand and associate contribution slows down. Among companies posting weaker earnings was Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd, which saw its net profit decline 11% to RM320.63 million for 1QFY18 on lower palm oil prices. The results came with \u201cno major surprises\u201d, according to Affin Hwang Capital Research. KLCCP Stapled Group Bhd saw full-year earnings for 2017 decline 0.91% to RM877.9 million, dragged down by higher operating costs in its management services, meeting the expectations of MIDF Research, Maybank Investment Bank Research and CIMB Research. According to Bloomberg data, earnings per share for all the stocks is estimated to grow at 3.22% over the next one year, with an estimated decline in price-earnings ratio from a current 16.71 times to 16.37 times by year end. Average dividends per share are projected to grow 2.98% in the next 12 months. Construction firms with exposure to infrastructure work is expected to see better earnings The onslaught of mega infrastructure projects in Malaysia, supported by an expected increase in Chinese investments on the back of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), has long been expected to boost growth in the construction sector. As the financial results for small- and mid-cap construction stocks trickle in, most seem to have enjoyed improved revenue in the previous quarter but not all saw this growth reflected in their bottom line. TRIplc Bhd was one of the standouts, seeing its net profit increasing fourfold to RM6.4 million for the second quarter ending Nov 30, 2017 as it collected triple the amount of revenue compared to a year ago from two maintenance concessions. KKB Engineering Bhd, meanwhile, recorded a turnaround in 4QFY17 with a net profit of RM5.34 million, versus a net loss of RM4.06 a year earlier, as it saw revenue jump 2.7 times to RM70.17 million from its civil construction and steel pipe manufacturing divisions. Another strong performer was Gabungan AQRS Bhd, which saw its 4QFY17 net profit double to RM15.23 million on higher revenue as the group moved into the more progressive construction stages. This included its work on the Sungai Besi\u2013Ulu Kelang (SUKE) Highway, Pusat Pentadbiran Sultan Ahmad Shah and Light Rail Transit 3 (LRT3) projects. On the flip side, WZ Satu posted what Affin Hwang Capital Research called a \u201cdisappointing\u201d decline in earnings by 94% to RM497,000 million for 1QFY18 as it absorbed a RM1.3 million loss from an associate due to the ongoing ban on bauxite mining in Pahang. Maybank Investment Bank Research had said in a note in January that it expects construction groups with work exposure to the second Mass Rapid Transit (MRT2) line, the MRT3 and the Pan Borneo Sarawak Highway to report relatively stronger earnings this year as work accelerates. Hong Leong Investment Bank Research, meanwhile, said that loan disbursements and approvals to the sector were seen growing at 13% and 20% y-o-y, while the sector\u2019s development expenditure is at its highest level posted in the last six years."}, "149": {"date_posted": "14February2018", "title": "CIMB, Maybank among AllianceDBS top picks as Malaysia stock valuation turns undemanding", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 14): AllianceDBS Research Sdn Bhd said Malaysian equities may not be cheap by historical trend but it has been a laggard in 2017 and relative valuation against regional markets has turned undemanding.

Post GE14, the market will be back to being driven by fundamentals which are well supported by gross domestic product (GDP) and corporate growth expectations, it added. \"The Malaysian stock market is well supported by sound domestic fundamentals despite the recent sell down stoked by US Dow Jones\u2019 correction,\" the investment bank said in a statement issued following its first-half 2018 (1H18) market outlook session on Saturday. The Dow Jones plunged more than 1,000 points last Thursday in another volatile day for the stock market. It was the second-worst single-day point drop in history, beaten only by the record set after Feb 5's 1,175-point drop. It closed 410.37 points or 1.7% higher at 24,601.27 on Monday. For 1H18, Maybank IB expects fiscal stimulus pre-GE14 and Bank Negara Malaysia\u2019s overnight policy rate (OPR) hike to be the two main thematics driving investment. \"For a longer term play, the focus is on three other thematics, namely multi-year orderbook replenishment in infrastructure construction; tourism; and Look East, Malaysia,\" it said. The investment bank noted potential beneficiaries of fiscal stimulus pre-GE14 will be those in the consumer-based, as fiscal stimulus to boost disposal income is expected to continue and will be front loaded in 1H18. The OPR hike, on the other hand, have positive impact on banks. Maybank IB said it favours proven contractors who have delivered over the years, and have high potential of winning the upcoming mega works. These include Gamuda Bhd, IJM Corp Bhd and Sunway Construction Bhd and Cahya Mata Sarawak Bhd. \"The tourism thematic is driven by increased in higher quality/higher-spend tourists and Visit Malaysia Year 2020, which is expected to give a boost to tourism as was the case in the previous two in 2007 and 2014. \"In 2007 and 2014, tourist arrivals surged 19% year-on-year (y-o-y) and 7% y-o-y respectively, while tourism receipts grew 27% y-o-y and 10% y-o-y respectively,\" said the investment bank. For the Look East Malaysia theme, Maybank IB sees latent potential in Sabah, Sarawak and the east coast of the peninsula. It expects the major back-bone infrastructure currently under construction, namely Pan Borneo Sarawak Highway, Pan Borneo Sabah Highway, East Cost Rail Link, to lift economic activities. \"For Sarawak, the Development Bank of Sarawak and Petroleum Sarawak Bhd and for Sabah, the Sabah International Petroleum Sdn Bhd are also\ncatalysts,\" it noted. Long term potential beneficiaries of this thematic are Cahya Mata Sarawak, Hock Seng Lee Bhd and KKB Engineering Bhd, Bintulu Port Bhd, Suria Capital Bhd and IJM Corp. Maybank IB has an \"overweight\" stance on the construction, automotive and oil \u00a0and gas sectors this year. Its top stock picks for 2018 are IOI Corp Bhd, Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd, Gamuda, Yinson Holdings Bhd, Genting Bhd, Cahya Mata Sarawak, Bermaz Auto Bhd and YTL Hospitality REIT. It also expects Malaysia\u2019s macroeconomic backdrop to remain positive in 2018, with another year of above 5% real GDP growth, at 5.3%, continuing the momentum from 2017. This is underpinned by sustained consumer spending growth momentum, stronger growth in investments with existing and rollout of new major infrastructure and investment projects, and the rebound in Government consumption expenditure. It remains optimistic on the ringgit and has recently revised its end-2018 forecast of 3.90 to 3.65 against the US dollar. Nevertheless, Maybank IB highlighted two key market risk factors that could derail sentiment, namely geopolitics risks and financial imbalances and instability, including a faster-than-expected step up in US Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy normalisation.

The roadshow ended on Saturday in Kuala Lumpur."}, "152": {"date_posted": "8February2018", "title": "Market will remain volatile in 2018", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: While the local stock market regained some lost ground yesterday after the two-day fall, investment analysts and equity strategists do not think Bursa Malaysia is in calmer waters now. Volatility could be the norm this year, according to Maybank Kim Eng head of research and global investment strategist Sadiq Currimbhoy. Currimbhoy expects that the bond yield is going to climb further due to concerns about inflation particularly in the US. \u201cI think that is going to create market volatility for equities ... at least for the first part of the year,\u201d he told the press on the sidelines of the Fifth World Capital Markets Symposium 2018 yesterday. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to say [if the market upturn will continue to be sustainable] as any market can now go any direction,\u201d he said. Noting that Asean markets as a whole are actually \u201cquite cheap\u201d compared with other markets, Currimbhoy said the relative valuation of Asean compared with China is very low. After losing nearly 60 points in the course of two days, the FBM KLCI opened 15.09 points higher at 1,827.11 points in what analysts referred to as a \u201crelief rebound\u201d, as investors bargain-hunted for beaten-down Malaysian shares after the global equity market selldown. The benchmark index swung to close in the positive territory at 1,836.68 points yesterday, up by 24.23 points or 1.34% \u2014 it was indeed among top performers in the region. Some major regional bourses, such as Hong Kong and South Korea, continued to head south. The gains on component stocks, like Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd and banking stocks CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd and Public Bank Bhd, fuelled the rebound. However, the upward trend was not across the board. There were 540 gainers versus 527 losers on Bursa yesterday. The FBM Small Cap Index was almost flat, only up 2.29 points or 0.01% at 16,285 points. This indicates that market sentiment remained cautious following the fierce selldown. \u201cThe rebound in the US markets [on Tuesday] is not yet a strong indication of the bottom,\u201d AmBank Retail Research vice-president Lim Sae Wai told The Edge Financial Daily. Lim said although bullish signals such as a piercing line pattern was identified in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, he is still waiting for more confirmation signals. \u201cSimilarly, I think it is still uncertain in Malaysia and it may be too early to call it a bottom. We should expect more volatility, yo-yo, or zigzag pattern this week, and probably the next too,\u201d Lim said. For the past two days, global equity markets, including that of Malaysia\u2019s, were jolted following the plunge in US stocks amid rising concerns that the latest US jobs report and inflationary pressures would force the US Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rates faster than expected. The Dow tumbled in consecutive days of frenzied selldown, resulting in a decline of over 1,840 points since last Friday, before it turned in a 567-point gain to close at 24,912.77 points on Tuesday. On the technical front, Lim said support levels for the benchmark index are expected at 1,813, then at 1,795 points. But while the FBM KLCI stayed relatively resilient throughout the day, the broader market lost some footing as many stocks gradually turned negative. Lim said this suggests that Asian markets were still concerned about further selling in the US. Echoing Lim\u2019s more cautious stance, TA Securities technical analyst Stephen Soo said Malaysian stocks are not oversold and may continue to see a selldown, if external sentiment takes a turn for the worse. Regional bourses closed mixed elsewhere yesterday: Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 closed 0.16% higher, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index fell 0.89%, and South Korea\u2019s Kospi retreated 2.31%.\n\u00a0"}, "153": {"date_posted": "8February2018", "title": "Maybank upgrades Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering to buy ", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 8): Maybank Kim Eng analyst Liaw Thong Jung upgraded the recommendation on Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd to buy from hold.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nMaybank Kim Eng raised the target price to RM1 from 75 sen implying a 22 percent increase from the last regular trade.

A large contributor to these listings is i-VCAP Management Sdn Bhd, which launched its fifth ETF early this month, on the same day it announced that it was planning to launch up to six more this year. This is part of an aggressive push by the company to promote ETFs to Malaysian investors, in line with their growing popularity as a cheaper investing option the world over. According to research firm ETFGI, global ETF assets totalled US$4.6 trillion last year, growing by more than a trillion dollars from 2016. i-VCAP is currently the biggest ETF provider in the country. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ValueCAP Sdn Bhd, which is equally owned by Khazanah Nasional Bhd, Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) and Permodalan Nasional Bhd. This gives its newly minted CEO, Khairi Shahrin Arief Baki, plenty to do this year. He says from his experience of working in equities, he has observed a trend towards passive strategies like ETFs in the international markets. \u201cThe landscape has changed, the way people do business has also changed. If you look at Wealthfront, Betterment or Charles Schwab in the US, they have all gone into robo-advisory and where do they put their money? In ETFs. People have actually shifted towards a more passive way of investing,\u201d he comments. \u201cI believe this is the right time. We have had five products in the last 10 years and now we\u2019re going to double it in just one year. That in itself is a huge task and that\u2019s why we have to work together. For this to be a successful year, we have to come up with something that the market really wants.\u201d This is why i-VCAP chose to kick off the year with MyETF Dow Jones Islamic Market US Titans 50 (MyETF-US50), the first US dollar-denominated shariah-compliant security to be listed on Bursa. As its name implies, MyETF-US50 will track the Dow Jones Islamic Market US Titans 50. The latter, in turn, tracks 50 shariah-compliant US blue chips and is highly correlated to the S&P 500 Index, providing investors with a chance to gain exposure to such companies as Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc at one go. \u201cThe S&P 500 achieved a return of 19.4% last year and has a projected earnings per share growth of 15% this year. While valuations appear to be elevated relative to historical levels, we believe this has yet to factor in the potential impact of US President Donald Trump\u2019s policy initiatives, such as a reduction in regulatory burden and lower corporate taxes. The proposed reduction in corporate tax to 21% could lift the S&P 500\u2019s EPS by a further 7% to 9%,\u201d Khairi said during the launch of MyETF-US50. The US$500 million ETF will be listed at US$1 on Feb 28 with a total annual fee of 0.475%. The initial public offering will be on Feb 9. The ETF will be rebalanced semi-annually and selected purely by market capitalisation. The underlying index of Dow Jones was selected because it closely tracks the S&P 500. Investors can access the ETF through any brokerage firm that has a multi-currency platform. \u201cBefore we decide on an index, we normally perform a back test and send out our request for proposal to index providers. They come back with some prototype and we will do our analysis. This index tracks the US market quite well, which means its beta is very close to that of the S&P 500. If you\u2019re talking about investors who like US equities in their portfolio, they can use this as a beta for the stock market, and do stock picking to get the alpha,\u201d says Khairi. In recent years, the growing interest in ETFs has stemmed from the low fees and the diverse exposure they offer investors in terms of geography and specific themes. A 2016 study by S&P 500 shows that 99% of actively managed US equity funds sold in Europe have failed to beat the S&P 500 in the last decade, and only two out of 100 global equity funds have beaten the S&P Global 1200 since 2006. The first ETF listing in Malaysia was in 2005. According to the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC), the total number of ETF units outstanding as at end-November 2017 was 1,707 million with a market capitalisation of roughly RM1.9 billion. The growth of volume and value traded year on year, however, has been slow. Last year, the SC introduced a number of guidelines to spur the growth of the ETF market \u2014 it lowered the minimum capital requirement for ETF issuers and reduced the time to market in the issuance process. The regulator also launched a framework for robo-advisors last year with licences for the Digital Investment Framework Management to be issued in the middle of this year. These moves are in line with Khairi\u2019s vision of i-VCAP, which had assets under management of RM1.33 billion as at end-December 2017. \u201cBack in 2016, the SC brought in some speakers from robo-advisory companies (to the SCxSC conference), so we were already talking about ETFs but we didn\u2019t have the ecosystem here. That\u2019s why fund managers still like to pick stocks the traditional way. But once the SC announces guidelines for robo-advisors, demand will pick up. To do robo-advisory, you need ETFs,\u201d he says. The role of robo-advisors and ETFs in shaping a more technology-based and accessible asset management industry is already evident in many developed markets. This is something Khairi wants to see in Malaysia as well, especially as the younger generation will prefer more tech-savvy platforms in the future. \u201cIt\u2019s a different world out there. That\u2019s what I told management during my interview with the\u00a0group CEO, chairman and directors. Technology is the way to go, robo-advisors are really popular out there.\u201d Another trend Khairi has noticed is the use of micro-investing through apps, where one can invest as little as RM5 a month. He says the younger generation are already tech-savvy and may prefer to use their smartphones to invest. \u201cWe would like to look at that space in the near future. There are just 20 of us here, so we need a technology partner. After that, we don\u2019t need any branches or bricks and mortar and things like that. Everybody can download our app or go to our website and register, and start to invest because it is all online.\u201d Nevertheless, iVCAP\u2019s push for ETFs comes when some observers in the global industry have cautioned investors against the risks posed by ETFs. Bank of America Merrill Lynch warned last July that the influx of ETFs was distorting the stock market by skewing the number of actual shares available. And if there is a market correction, investors may face problems in liquidating their ETF positions. Khairi, however, says it is a matter of perception. \u201cAt the moment, the ETF market is still relatively small compared with mutual funds. It is only about a quarter [the size] of mutual funds. As at end-2017, the global ETF market stood at US$4.6 trillion with 5,400 issuances while the US mutual fund market stood at US$16.4 trillion with 9,511 funds. Most mutual funds also invest in the same stocks. Money outflow from mutual funds to ETFs is due to costs. Also, if the market drops, the whole industry, including mutual funds, will drop. \u201cNo doubt, the risk is higher for investors trading during the major rebalancing periods of ETFs in the developed markets. But based on the current size of the local ETF market, the impact may be negligible at this point in time.\u201d There have also been concerns about how ETFs make investors put money in big companies instead of those with good fundamentals, thus exposing them to high risk. According to Khairi, a variety of ETFs in the market can help prevent that from happening. \u201cFor example, there is alternative weighting, non-large cap exposure, smart beta or factor-based ETFs, which systematically capture the fundamentals of a company. Thus, it is important for the market to grow and offer ETFs that are structured differently or with different underlying assets or exposure,\u201d he says. \u00a0 A wealth of experience Khairi\u2019s observations on the changing investing landscape come from his 14 years of working at several brokerage firms. His most recent post was as the senior director and head of dealing, equity markets, at MIDF Amanah Investment Bank. Before that, he worked at Citigroup Global Markets, JP Morgan Securities, Maybank Investment Bank and OSK Investment Bank, involved mostly in institutional equity sales and business development. After graduation, Khairi worked in customer service for six months before joining OSK. While the two industries were vastly different, some of the skills he had to perfect remained the same. \u201cI always say broking is an overpaid customer service job because as brokers, you still pick up the phone to talk to customers, except that the clients on the other side are fund managers. I started with OSK and spent about five years there, learning a lot. I remember even going to places like the canteen of a post office, setting up a table and handing out account-opening forms to people,\u201d he says. His dealings in equities familiarised him with shariah-compliant and fundamental stocks. He remembers writing a light-hearted, year-end note to his clients when he was with Citigroup, asking them which stocks they would consider for the following year. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you look at your daily life from the moment you get up in the morning? If you are female, what facial cleanser, perfume, shoes or bags do you use? Look at your phone. Are you a Samsung or Apple person? Do you switch on the TV? Are you on Netflix or Astro? Later in the morning, you pick up a cup of coffee. Are you a Starbucks person? Then you commute to work. Some people drive different cars and some take the MRT. \u201cI wrote to clients, saying that sometimes you need to look at the products you use. And if you are comfortable with them, believe in them and recommend them to your friends, they should be on your list of stocks. That should be the way you look at how you want to invest as well,\u201d Khairi says. He took up i-VCAP\u2019s offer \u2014 his first job on the buy side \u2014 because he was looking for a bigger role with more challenges. \u201cI had worked for an independent company, a big government-linked company, a not-so-big government-linked company and some big global names. All that experience helped shape me to take on this new challenge. Of course, I had been on the sell side for 14 years, but I would say as CEO, it\u2019s very much about sales, business development and holding up the team,\u201d he says. In his previous jobs, Khairi\u2019s clients were mainly the country\u2019s major institutional investors, connections that he hopes will help him in guiding i-VCAP through its new phase of growth as most of the ETF volume and value traded is expected to come from them. \u201cBecause of our capital market blueprint, 75% of our market trade value is controlled by institutional investors. So, we have study what sort of investments to look at as they would be our key clients. That would be the way for us going forward. \u201cWe have big insurance companies, big pension funds and big unit trust companies as well. For example, if their recent products are aimed at China, that\u2019s also where we want to look, so they can buy those ETFs as their core investment,\u201d he says. Bespoke ETF products can also be created for institutional clients but as they will be listed on Bursa, retail investors can also participate. i-VCAP\u2019s target breakdown of investor participation is 75% institutional and 25% retail, in line with Bursa\u2019s. \u00a0 Building appetite for ETFs When i-VCAP launched MyETF-US50, Khairi says he had to explain what ETFs were to many of his friends. Thus, the company plans to launch more educational campaigns this year concurrently with its new ETFs to raise investor awareness of these passive investments. \u201cWe are definitely going to work with both Bursa and the SC. We plan to talk to the students and lecturers of business and accounting faculties at universities because they need to be aware of ETFs. The students need to know about ETFs before they enter the market, not only because they will be working in the financial line but also because they could be potential investors,\u201d Khairi says. Other than institutional investors, i-VCAP will also be targeting sophisticated clients, he adds. \u201cBecause of their background and education, it would be easier for them to understand ETFs. They can read a few articles and get the picture. In terms of education, first it will be the financial people, then the more sophisticated investors, which is the group private bankers cover, as well as financial advisors because they cover a range of high-net-worth individuals.\u201d The launch of different ETFs is expected to spur investor interest in Malaysia. In fact, the SC announced early last year that local investors could expect to trade physically backed commodity, smart beta, leveraged and inverse ETFs this year. Apart from MyETF-US50, i-VCAP has four other ETFs in its stable. Its first, the Dow Jones Islamic Market Malaysia Titans 25, was launched in 2008 and has seen an annual growth of 10% to 12%. Its MSCI Malaysia Islamic Dividend ETF has grown more than 15% a year while its MSCI Southeast Asia Islamic Dividend ETF and Thomson Reuters Asia-Pacific ex Japan Islamic agribusiness ETF have seen a less than 5% growth due to the appreciation of the ringgit. The tracking error of i-VCAP\u2019s funds has been below 3% so far, which is the company\u2019s target. However, this is higher than the industry average of global ETFs, remarks Khairi. \u201cThis is because in the more developed markets, they can do securities borrowing and lending, they can lend out the underlying shares of the stocks in the fund, so they get fees, which cover part of the expense ratio. That\u2019s why their tracking is very close (to the benchmark) because their performance is not eaten up by expenses. But with the introduction of Bursa\u2019s Islamic Securities Selling and Buying Negotiated Transaction framework, and as a shariah compliant fund, we can now do lending,\u201d he says, adding that this can help reduce the tracking error of i-VCAP\u2019s funds. Khairi says the company has not firmed up the themes of the upcoming ETFs but has a rough idea of the areas it is interested in. \u201cWe need more options now. For example, not everybody wants to go into the US. Some might want to go into China, so we are looking at that. That probably would not be just one but two different funds because even for China, it depends on whether you are talking about China or Greater China. We haven\u2019t decided what the six ETFs will track yet but China will definitely be there. \u201cI\u2019m inclined towards technology, so in the US, you can do something like Nasdaq, for instance. It has been performing well and there are a lot of names there that people would really love to invest in. We are also looking at Japan and we would like to look at thematic ETFs as well. It\u2019s not easy to sell ETFs compared with other products, so we have to go for the ones that attract interest.\u201d"}, "155": {"date_posted": "7February2018", "title": "\u2018Initiatives good, but more needs to be done\u2019", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: Fund managers have reacted positively to measures to stimulate Bursa Malaysia, including liberalising margin financing rules and allowing intraday short selling, but said more needs to be done to boost trading volume. In his speech at the World Capital Markets Symposium 2018 here yesterday, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak announced several measures to make the local stock market more attractive. New investors would also be given a fee waiver of trading and clearing fees for six months to encourage trade, he added. Inter-Pacific Securities Sdn Bhd head of research Pong Teng Siew is looking forward to the three-year waiver of the stamp duty on mid- and small-cap companies\u2019 shares traded on Bursa beginning next month, as he said small-cap stocks had underperformed in January. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough market this year and the small-cap [stocks] have not been performing very well in January and thus, lowering the transaction costs is definitely good,\u201d he told The Edge Financial Daily. However, Pong opined that the attempt to connect Bursa and the Singapore Exchange would do little to make the local market more attractive, saying Singaporean investors have gone off Malaysian shares following the closure of the Central Limit Order Book (Clob) in the early 2000s. Clob was a secondary market in Singapore that traded mainly Malaysian stocks. In its heyday, transactions on the Clob reportedly far exceeded the transaction volumes of Singapore shares listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange\u2019s main board. Its closure left many Singapore shareholders holding billions in Malaysian shares listed on Clob. They later sold their shares at a discount. \u201cFrom my personal experience talking to investors in Singapore, they are not keen on [investing in] Malaysian shares, especially older investors who remember the Clob case. \u201cBefore the Internet was big, Singapore investors did not have the means to invest globally, so they bought a lot of Malaysian shares due to our geographical proximity. It made sense for them to look across the border for Malaysian shares, which were more interesting,\u201d he said. Nowadays, Pong said, there are more options, aided by the Internet which allows more cross-border linkages with brokers worldwide, so Singaporean investors have alternatives to consider besides the Malaysian market. \u201cQuite frankly, I think it is an uphill battle to win back Singaporean investors. The [proposed trading] link is a good move, but it\u2019s not enough.\u201d Areca Capital Sdn Bhd chief executive officer (CEO) Danny Wong said the connection between the two bourses is a step in the right direction, but he is looking forward to the previously proposed Asean platform which has yet to materialise. \u201cThis link is a good first step and if the model works, maybe we could replicate it with the other Asean members. \u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping for is a common platform for everyone to participate, with similar pricing, lower fees, common regulation and even better, with some kind of mechanism around the currency tied to the exchanges. This will encourage more liquidity in the Asean region,\u201d he said. Nevertheless, Wong believes that introducing a new category of traders, known as \u201ctrading specialists\u201d who trade using their own accounts, will help boost Bursa\u2019s liquidity. \u201cWith this measure, market makers will be allowed to facilitate more trades.\u201d This in turn will attract more investors, he said, noting that foreign funds have not returned to Malaysia due to liquidity issues. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if the trading link between Malaysia and Singapore will have a significant impact, but this trading specialist measure may be more effective. I\u2019m really looking forward to this,\u201d Wong added. Maybank Investment Bank Bhd and Maybank Kim Eng group CEO Datuk John Chong positively views the government\u2019s efforts to boost the trading of mid- and small-cap stocks on Bursa, saying it is pivotal for small and medium enterprises. \u201cThe initiatives announced today (yesterday) offer short-term tactical and long-term structural transformations that will augur well for the stock market and encourage increased market activities,\u201d he said in a statement. Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd head of research Kenny Yee believes the measures to be introduced would encourage the market velocity going forward. \u201cThe waiver of stamp duty for small- and mid-caps may encourage the participation in such stocks,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0"}, "156": {"date_posted": "7February2018", "title": "Bursa-SGX trading link to learn from defunct ATL", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: The proposed trading link between Bursa Malaysia and Singapore Exchange (SGX), to be set up by the end of this year, will be built on learnings from the now-defunct Asean Trading Link (ATL), said the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) chairman Tan Sri Ranjit Ajit Singh. Launched in September 2012, ATL linked seven stock exchanges across Asean. Having disbanded in October last year, it only managed to connect three markets \u2014 Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. It was reported that since the onset of its operation, the ATL faced technical problems, especially with the clearing and settlement system. The different laws and regulations concerning capital control of each country had also hindered cross-market trading. \u201cWe\u2019ve clearly seen some of the weaknesses associated with the ATL [such as] the difficult structure and the costs associated with it,\u201d Ranjit told reporters after the opening of the Fifth World Capital Markets Symposium 2018 (WCMS 2018) here yesterday. According to him, the Bursa-SGX trading link will be a \u201cbetter version\u201d of the ATL. Challenges such as post-trade settlement issues will be addressed in the new cross-border trading link, said Ranjit. \u201cWithin the region, these are the two markets (Malaysia and Singapore) that can create a pioneering effort for a better version of the ATL structure. This could then create the possibility of extending [the trading link] to other markets within Asean.\u201d Ranjit said the discussions involving the proposed trading link are currently more specific towards its infrastructure. \u201cThe broad frameworks within Asean for cross-border investment schemes still apply,\u201d he added, referring to the Streamlined Review Framework for the Asean Common Prospectus established in 2015 to facilitate cross-border offerings of equity securities and plain debt securities in the region. Earlier in his opening speech, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak said the Malaysian and Singaporean capital markets have matured enough to establish a trading link between the two this year, with a regulatory arrangement to be worked out by both countries. \u201cAfter discussions with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore, I am glad to say we have agreed that both markets have reached a sufficient level, sophistication and degree of maturity for us to establish a market corridor connecting Malaysia and Singapore, with a trading link between our respective exchanges to spur further mutual benefits and harness the economic potential of our two nations,\u201d he said. Dubbed the \u201cMalaysia-Singapore Connect\u201d, Najib said the link will provide investors on both sides of the causeway with easier, seamless access to each other\u2019s stock markets, with a combined market capitalisation of more than US$1.2 trillion (RM4.7 trillion) and 1,600 public-listed companies. CIMB Group Holdings Bhd chairman Datuk Seri Nazir Razak said the Malaysia-Singapore Connect initiative will bring \u201creal upside\u201d for stakeholders in both markets \u2014 but only if it allows for better cross-border fundraising mechanisms. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the trading link before, and there are many inter-broker [services] already, so [the benefits from] that [implementation] will be a bit limited. But if it is a precursor to make it easy [for companies] to raise funds in both markets, that would be great,\u201d he told reporters on the sidelines of WCMS 2018. Bursa Malaysia Bhd chief executive officer (CEO) Datuk Seri Tajuddin Atan said the trading link will allow investors to trade and settle shares listed on each other\u2019s stock markets in a more convenient and cost-efficient manner. \u201cThe exchange (Bursa) will work with SGX, the industry and the relevant regulatory bodies in operationalising this cross-border initiative,\u201d he said in a filing with Bursa yesterday. Tajuddin\u2019s Singaporean counterpart Loh Boon Chye said the trading link will provide a unique opportunity to galvanise wider interest in listed companies and boost trading activities in both markets. \u201cEach market will continue to be governed by its own listing, trading and clearing rules and regulations. \u201cWe will utilise technology to implement an end-to-end solution that delivers a better and more efficient experience for market participants,\u201d the SGX CEO said in a separate statement. Datuk John Chong, CEO of Maybank Investment Bank Bhd and Maybank Kim Eng Group, believes the proposed trading link will enable the group to serve its clients better and enhance its product offerings. \u201cIt is certainly positive and will increase the vibrancy of both capital markets.\u201d Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd head of research Kenny Yee concurs, saying the Malaysia-Singapore Connect would be another catalyst for the local bourse as Malaysian equities are highly sought after by Singaporean investors. \u201cThe move will also encourage retail participation from both countries.\u201d"}, "157": {"date_posted": "6February2018", "title": "Maybank IB welcomes govt measures to boost Malaysia, Singapore capital markets", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 6): Maybank Investment Bank Bhd (Maybank IB) has lauded the proposed measure to link the Malaysian and Singaporean capital markets, as announced by the Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak at the World Capital Markets Symposium earlier this morning.\u00a0 Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak had announced Malaysia and Singapore will be setting up a connected market corridor, called 'Malaysia-Singapore Connect', with a trading link between the exchanges of both countries. \"We welcome the move by both governments to set up the Malaysia\u2013Singapore Connect.

Chinese property companies have been raising funds and in some cases, have reportedly had to go through multiple rounds of re-pricing in order to get deals done,\" the analysts said.\u00a0 How the latter part of the year works out, depends on how policymakers react to the global environment, the report noted.\u00a0 \u201cThe Fed, with a new chairman, could accelerate rate hikes and \u2018get ahead of the curve\u2019. New chairman, Jerome Powell, the first non-economist to head the Fed for some time, may indeed want to show his inflation-fighting credentials.\u00a0 \"Ultimately, we think the bond market may be the one driving any decisions. Nevertheless, having already started raising rates, the Fed has some flexibility to act,\u201d the duo said. They also noted the situation in Europe is also another area to watch out for and could be more difficult with the European Central Bank (ECB) determined to continue buying bonds until September, even as data remains, and could stay strong.\u00a0 As for Japan, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has announced it will continue the easy money policy, Chan noted. \u201cIndeed, we reckon the ECB could be at a critical junction.

TA Securities analyst Tan Kam Meng expects the airport operator to return excess cash to shareholders by way of a special dividend distribution. \u201cAccording to (MAHB\u2019s) announcement [last Friday], the disposal does not require shareholders\u2019 approval, and the proceeds are intended for general corporate purposes and expenses in relation to the proposed disposal. We believe the general corporate purposes would mean any possible mergers and acquisitions in the future or special dividends to shareholders,\u201d he said in a note to clients yesterday. MAHB is selling its entire stake in GHIAL to India\u2019s GMR Airports Ltd. GHIAL currently manages the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad, India for a concession period until 2068. The gain arising from the exercise is estimated to be RM255.14 million or 15.4 sen per share. Tan said factoring in the disposal of GHIAL into his forecast, he has raised the financial year 2018 (FY18) dividend to 18 sen per share from 10 sen previously as he believes half of the gains would likely be paid out as dividend based on its dividend policy of 50%. He said that it is not a surprise to see MAHB unlocking its investment in India as the company had earlier disposed of its 10% stake in the Delhi International Airport to GMR Airports in 2015. In fact, GHIAL would be the last investment the company has in India, he added. Tan is maintaining a \u201csell\u201d call on MAHB with a RM8.64 target price (TP), as he is of the view that the market has fully priced in those positive catalysts including earnings recovery, concession extension, possible sale of minority stake in Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen International Airport in Turkey and a special dividend. AllianceDBS Research analyst Marvin Khor said while MAHB did not specify plans for the utilisation of disposal proceeds in its announcement, he estimated that the full payout via dividends of the RM295.34 million cash consideration would amount to an additional 17.8 sen per share, which would more than double his projected FY18 dividend yield to 3.5%. \u201cAs we project MAHB\u2019s near-term capital expenditure (capex) plans to be well-funded by its organic cash flow, we believe payout of a significant portion of the proceeds is well within the means of the group,\u201d he said in a note. Khor is maintaining a \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation on MAHB, raising his TP to RM10.15 from RM10. \u201cWe continue to be positive on MAHB\u2019s earnings growth prospects, bolstered by the potential disposal of a partial stake in its Turkish operations.\u201d For Maybank IB Research analyst Mohshin Aziz, however, he doesn\u2019t expect the company to return excess cash to shareholders, noting that MAHB is likely to conserve the cash as it has big capex projects coming onstream over the next two years. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are required to pay any special dividends as they already have an established dividend payout ratio of 50% and they have been adhering to it diligently,\u201d Mohshin told The Edge Financial Daily via telephone. Maybank has a \u201csell\u201d call on MAHB, with a TP of RM8.11.

Typically, when the ringgit strengthens, the stock market index will also go up. It is a very simple correlation,\" he told reporters on the sidelines of Invest Malaysia 2018 here today. \"As the ringgit is currently strengthening, the KLCI can probably go up between 5% and 10% this year, it is not difficult,\" said Cheah, who is the chairman and co-chief investment officer of Hong Kong-listed Value Partners Group Ltd. He added that going forward, the ringgit will become more attractive, given the anticipated interest rate hike in Malaysia. Cheah said unfortunately, the Malaysian stock market is \"not cheap\", considering its price-earnings ratio (PER) of about 16.5 times. \"It is not cheap enough for me to be excited.\" He noted that although some foreign stock markets have climbed, Singapore and China stocks are still slightly cheaper than Malaysian stocks in terms of PER. Cheah also sees the KLCI performance will be further boosted by the election factor. \"Do not forget (2018) is an election year. Typically, Malaysian stocks will go up in the election year. This has been the trend in most elections in the last years. The only election year that the stock market did not go up was in 2008, due to global financial crisis,\" he said. Cheah favours selective plantation stocks, as well as those in the oil and gas (O&G) sector. He, however, warned investors against investing in property stocks due to the current oversupply of condominiums and shopping malls in the country. \"Currently, in Malaysia, we (Value Partners) only have exposure on plantation stocks. I know many people don't like plantation stocks right now, but from a global perspective, we always have room for that,\" he said. Cheah highlighted that many O&G companies have become leaner over the years and hence, the recent global oil price recovery should bode well to them. \"(The impact of) Brent, at US$70 per barrel today, is the same as US$85 per barrel before, because their (O&G firms') cost has come down for about US$15. I think the rally will continue. I'm actually a little bit excited about oil and gas sector,\" he said. He pointed out that he appreciates the effort by Malaysian companies such as Sime Darby Group in enhancing shareholders value by undertaking restructuring exercises. \"I'm looking forward to more restructuring efforts as such, from the likes of Malayan Banking Bhd and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd,\" he said. Meanwhile, Cheah said Bursa Malaysia should consider setting up a new board that allows local technology companies to undertake a dual-class share structure listing. \"The promoters and founders of technology companies typically want to retain control, even if they have sold some shares.

PetChem\u2019s share price has spiked 9% in the past month and is now close to our TP of RM8.50 (9.1 times 2018 enterprise value against earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) (10% premium to industry peers). Due to a limited upside to our TP, the stock is now a \u201chold\u201d.

We forecast its 4QFY17 factory utilisation rate to be lower at 82% (-13 percentage points [ppts] y-o-y; -4ppts q-o-q); this is due to closure of the Labuan methanol plant due to a scheduled turnaround. The cumulative FY17 Patmi of RM4.34 billion represents 103% and 105% of our full FY17 and consensus\u2019 forecasts.\u00a0 Year to date, the blended ASP is flattish y-o-y at RM3,384 per tonne, consistent with our FY18 forecast for a flat y-o-y ASP. However, given that crude oil prices have been rising, and given the fact that petrochemical prices tend to track crude oil prices, there is an upside potential to our ASP assumption. A 1% change in naphtha prices versus our base case (on a full-year basis) will move our FY18 earnings forecast by RM50 million, or 1.2%. However, it is still early in 2018 and we will monitor the situation closely.\u00a0 PetChem\u2019s valuations are already above the industry peer average, justified by its superior balance sheet and cash flows.

The excitement is set to continue for Bursa Malaysia ahead of the 14th general election (GE14), with the local market showing first signs of the much-anticipated pre-election rally since Jan 3. \u201cThe market has been on a strong upward trend amid the recovering ringgit and stronger oil price. Talk of a pre-election rally has resurfaced among investors, as well as in the media. While we see some profit-taking activities as we approach the end of our second week of trading, we believe the weakness in the market presents a good buying opportunity for investors and traders,\u201d Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd head of research Kenny Yee told The Edge Financial Daily. \u201cWe think that the high spirits leading to the elections, as well as the euphoria in the stock market seen in the developed markets will fuel the momentum in the domestic stock market,\u201d he added. Echoing the same sentiment, TA Securities research head Kaladher Govindan is of the view that the strong run in the benchmark index so far this year is in line with expectations. \u201cIt was within our expectations if you follow our strategy reports. We expect the FBM KLCI to hit 1,890 points in the first half of 2018 (1H18), especially in the first quarter before retreating in 2H18,\u201d Kaladher said via email. In its annual strategy report published on Dec 8 last year, TA Securities wrote that expectations of a GE14 rally should propel the FBM KLCI higher in 1H18, premised on the assumption the elections will be held in March or April this year. However, Kaladher highlighted a possible correction in the market in 1H18. \u201cA Barisan Nasional victory could hold up on the market momentarily, but we reckon the FBM KLCI could be due for a correction in 2H18 as concerns over the US monetary tightening and ringgit weakness reverberate across the market and translate into heavy foreign selling and a risk-averse strategy among investors,\u201d he added. However, Kaladher noted that the downside pressure can emerge sooner in 1H18 if the current ruling coalition\u2019s power base crumbles after the elections. Affin Hwang Asset Management is also optimistic about a better year in 2018 and expects the FBM KLCI to see a 6% to 8% upside, tracking market earnings growth. \u201cAnalysts are starting the year with a projection of 9% to 10% [growth]. The expectation is that the stronger ringgit will lead to margin expansion [as opposed to contraction] for domestic-oriented companies,\u201d its senior associate director of equities Cheryl Pola said. The FBM KLCI has climbed 8.6% over the past year. However, CIMB Investment Bank head of Malaysia research Ivy Ng believes the market still has legs to run, maintaining an end-2018 FBM KLCI target of 1,880 points. The local market ended the week on a positive note last week, with the FBM KLCI closing 5.79 points or 0.32% higher at 1,822.67. Market breadth was positive with 643 gainers versus 389 losers. Taking a look at the 30 constituents of the FBM KLCI, the best-performing stock so far is Sime Darby Bhd. The counter climbed 22.2% year to date (YTD) to close at RM2.70 last Friday. This was followed by Petronas Gas Bhd and YTL Corp Bhd, with gains of 8.7% and 8% respectively. Six of the FBM KLCI component stocks were on a downtrend, with KLCCP Stapled Group emerging as the worst performer YTD, falling 9.1% to close unchanged at RM7.85 last Friday. Apart from Axiata Group Bhd, the telecommunication sector has turned out to be a laggard YTD, with shares in DiGi.Com Bhd and Telekom Malaysia Bhd declining by 7.8% and 4.8% respectively. Maxis Bhd remained unchanged at RM6.01 last Friday. Sime Darby Plantation Bhd saw its share price fall 7.8% YTD to close at RM5.53 last Friday \u2014 moving in the opposite direction of Sime Darby. Despite a strong start to the year, the FBM KLCI is still underperforming its regional peers and developed markets. The Edge Financial Daily has spoken to several heads of research on some of the potential stocks they see among the component stocks that could run higher on the back of the positive sentiment in the global equity market, recovering oil prices and the ringgit, as well as the boost from the upcoming GE14. 1) Tenaga Nasional Bhd\u00a0 A screaming buy among analysts, Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) rose 3.4% in the first two weeks of the year. Most analysts continue to favour TNB as Bloomberg data shows that 20 out of 25 analysts that cover the stock have a \u201cbuy\u201d call. According to Rakuten Trade\u2019s Yee, the utility company\u2019s valuation is undemanding and provides decent dividend yield. At its closing price of RM15.78 last Friday, TNB is trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio (PER) of 12.9 times and has a dividend yield of about 3.9%. TNB is also CIMB\u2019s top three big caps for 2018 as Ng sees the stock offer a resilient organic earnings growth potential. According to her, it is building four new power plants in Malaysia, which could raise its generation earnings in 2017 to 2020. She also pointed out that stronger earnings driven by the new assets TNB acquired in the past year are another potential rerating catalyst. TA Securities, which has a target price (TP) of RM17.38 for TNB, indicating a potential return of about 10%, has also picked the utility company as one of its top picks. TA Securities analyst Kylie Chan Sze Zan said in an annual strategy report that TNB is attractive on most valuation metrics, including a 10.9 times forward PER, which is one standard deviation below historical average, 7.1 times forward enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, which is an 18% discount to regional peers. Based on Bloomberg\u2019s consensus data, the 12-month TP for TNB is at RM16.61, indicating a potential return of 5.3%. TNB was also one of the stocks that featured on The Edge Financial Daily\u2019s Top 10 Picks for 2018. 2) Axiata Group Bhd\u00a0 Axiata Group Bhd is expected to perform in 2018 as the telecommunication company is expected to see an improvement in its earnings after witnessing four consecutive years of earnings contraction at its operating companies \u2014 Celcom Axiata Bhd and Indonesia\u2019s PT XL Axiata Tbk. The turnaround appears to be expected by the market as seen by the gain of 1.1% in the first 10 trading days of 2018. This was in contrast to its share price performance in the last three years where it fell by about 14.6%. According to CIMB\u2019s Ng, Axiata\u2019s core earnings per share is expected to rebound by a strong 29% and 50% for its forecast for financial years ending Dec 31, 2018 and 2019 respectively due to much higher contributions from XL, net profit break-even for Airtel Bangladesh Ltd by end-2018 and cessation in equity accounting for Idea\u2019s losses post-merger with Vodafone. Rakuten\u2019s Yee concurred, noting that Axiata\u2019s digital transformation is expected to bring an improvement to its earnings. \u201cOther than that, the news flow of a potential initial public offering of its tower unit, edotco Group Sdn Bhd, this year is also another catalyst for Axiata,\u201d he said. 3) Banking sector \u2014\u00a0CIMB, Maybank Affin Hwang Asset Management\u2019s Pola is of the view that banks are among those that could do well in 2018. \u201cThis year has been about improvement in asset quality. In 2018, we should see stronger pre-provision growth, especially if interest rates rise, which will lead to net interest margin expansion [but to a lesser extent compared to its Singapore counterparts],\u201d she said. She added that loan growth should be slightly stronger after the disappointing 2017. Pola, however, noted that there is still an overhang on the sector as the impact of Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards 9 (MFRS9) has yet to be fully known but if the impact on provisions or book values is low as expected, it would clear another uncertainty that remains for the banking sector. \u201cOur top picks are CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (inexpensive valuations) and Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) (possibility of capital management after MFRS9, better cash dividends, the possible listing of Etiqa). Hong Leong Bank Bhd has impressive fundamentals but valuations are a bit stretched,\u201d she added. Similar to Pola, Rakuten\u2019s Yee highlighted that both CIMB and Maybank could be proxy for foreign buying into the banking sector. \u201cMaybank is also a defensive play with its relatively high dividend yield of over 5%,\u201d he added. TA Securities also picked CIMB as one of its top picks for 2018 in its annual strategy report. Its analyst Wong Li Hsia said CIMB has been outpacing its peers in terms of yearly profit growth since the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2015. She also pointed that better prospects in CIMB Niaga and CIMB Thai as one of the investment themes that will drive CIMB. \u201cCredit charges have eased. While we forecast the overall credit charge to remain elevated, we believe the worst \u2014 in terms of asset quality may be over, led by further recoveries in its overseas operations,\u201d Wong said. CIMB\u2019s share price gained 3.7% YTD to close at RM6.78 last Friday, while Maybank\u2019s share price edged higher by 0.5% to RM9.85. 4. Petronas Gas Bhd The selldown at the end of last year created a value proportion for those who are interested in investing in Petronas Gas Bhd (PetGas). The share price fell by 4.8% compared with three years ago to its closing price of RM19.00 last Friday. PetGas\u2019 share price fell to its low of RM15.88 in November last year compared with its three-year peak of RM22.02 in October 2015. Yee believes that the selldown was overdone and was mainly due to third-party access framework concern. While the market has recovered by 19.6% from its low since then, PetGas is still trading at about 4.9% below its three-year average price of RM19.93.\n\u00a0"}, "171": {"date_posted": "11January2018", "title": "AmBank Group to incur some RM100m from MSS \u2013 analysts", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: AMMB Holdings Bhd (AmBank Group) expects to shed at least 11% or 1,200 of its current 11,000 employees under the mutual separation scheme (MSS) that it recently launched to cut cost and improve efficiency, analysts say.

On Tuesday, The Edge Financial Daily reported that AmBank Group launched the MSS on Monday and that in an email to staff, it said eligible, confirmed employees of AmBank, AmInvestment Bank and AmBank Islamic could apply for it over a two-week period until Jan 19, 2018. It is understood that the MSS does not extend to AmBank Group\u2019s insurance division\u2019s 1,500 employees. \u201cAs such, the MSS will apply to about 9,500 staff, for which the take-up rate is estimated to be about 1,200, which is about 14% of the staff count (excluding insurance),\u201d Maybank IB Research said. AmBank Group is the sixth of Malaysia\u2019s eight local banking groups to launch a job rationalisation scheme in recent years. CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, RHB Bank Bhd, Hong Leong Bank Bhd, Alliance Bank Bhd and Affin Holdings Bhd\u2019s investment banking arm had offered schemes in the past two to three years. In a more recent exercise, Affin late last year shed just over 300 staff under a voluntary separation scheme. The banks have resorted to job rationalisation as they are more concerned than ever about becoming cost-efficient amid an increasingly challenging banking landscape that makes growing profits tougher. In AmBank Group\u2019s case, the group\u2019s cost-to-income ratio (CIR) \u2014 at 57.2% as at the first half of FY18 (1HFY18) \u2014 is among the highest in the industry. With the MSS, the group is unlikely to meet its target of bringing down CIR to at least 55% in FY18. However, the exercise will help it improve CIR over the longer term, analysts said. \u201cThe announcement of the MSS is not a surprise, given the group\u2019s rising cost structure where its CIR rose from the recent low of 45% in FY14 to 57% in 1HFY18 versus peers\u2019 average of 48%,\u201d UOB Kay Hian Research said in a report yesterday. The rising cost structure was largely due to new hires to ramp up the group\u2019s business banking franchise, it added. AmBank Group\u2019s net profit in 1HFY18 fell 2.35% year-on-year to RM659.74 million, while revenue rose 1.04% y-o-y to RM4.21 billion. Bloomberg data shows that of 18 analysts that track the group, nine have a \u201cbuy\u201d call on the stock, while six have a \u201cneutral\u201d, and three, a \u201csell\u201d. The average 12-month target price is RM4.70. The stock closed up eight sen at RM4.56 yesterday, bringing a market capitalisation of RM13.75 billion."}, "172": {"date_posted": "5January2018", "title": "Maybank upgraded to overweight at Morgan Stanley", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 5): Morgan Stanley analyst Nick Lord upgraded the recommendation on Malayan Banking Bhd to overweight from equal-weight.

The winners in the 12th edition of The Edge\u2019s Best Call Awards for 2017 were selected from 90 recommendations for 66 stocks received from 16 research houses. Last year, we received 86 nominations for 75 stocks from 14 outfits. Most nominations were from heads of research and the analysts themselves, others being fund managers and other analysts for their fellow colleagues. The winners include those who rightly stuck their neck out by calling an outright \u201csell\u201d (instead of just whispering it to clients) and were proved right. We were tempted to include more names as there were several other good calls but we decided to stop at 17 for 2017. Like last year, we made some allowances for calls made in 2016 that proved right in 2017. This year\u2019s list of 17 winners are our best-effort attempt to recognise good fundamental stock analysis and its importance in making investment decisions, based on submissions and publicly available data. Feedback on the methodology and winners is welcome at [email\u00a0protected] Feedback is also welcome on whether you would like The Edge to have a fund managers\u2019 poll on their best analysts and recommendations. With that, here are this year\u2019s winners in no particular order. Congratulations to the winners. To the good stock pickers who slipped under our radar, keep up the good work. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! \u00a0 \nRHB Research Institute former analyst Ng Sem Guan and analyst Muhammad Syafiq Mohd Salam\u2019s call on Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd By the time Press Metal was included as an FBM KLCI constituent on Dec 18, the largest integrated aluminium producer in Southeast Asia already had a market capitalisation of close to RM20 billion. It may be hard to imagine that the stock just crossed RM1 billion market capitalisation barely five years ago, in early 2013. By end-2016, its market capitalisation had risen to nearly RM6 billion, double what it was the year before. When RHB\u2019s former analyst Ng Sem Guan started coverage in June 2013, the comparable (adjusted) share price was 39.7 sen. Four-and-a-half years on, the stock is up a whopping 1,154% to RM4.98 as at Dec 15. Total returns are six times higher, with Press Metal paying dividends every quarter for the past three years, up from twice a year before that, Bloomberg data shows. It also had a two-for-one stock split and 40% bonus issue in 2016. Ng was also acknowledged for his early \u201cbuy\u201d call on Press Metal last year. According to Bloomberg data, RHB\u2019s Muhammad Syafiq Mohd Salam reiterated a \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation when assuming coverage on Aug 17 this year. In a note dated Nov 1, he told clients that Press Metal\u2019s size (RM16 billion marketcap) meant that it could be included as an index constituent, about a month before the inclusion was announced. Press Metal, which ran 113% from the start of the year to RM3.32 on Aug 17, appreciated another 50% over four months to RM4.98 on Dec 15 \u2014 bringing total gains for the year to 213%. At the time of writing, RHB still had a \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation and its RM5.30 target price \u2014 the highest among four analysts tracking the stock \u2014 implying only 6.4% upside potential. Risks to his forecast include a sharply weaker greenback, lower aluminium prices and unexpected production disruptions. A notable mention also goes to Kenanga Research\u2019s Voon Yee Ping, who also rightly stuck with a \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation this year despite the strong price gains. Two other houses had \u201cneutral\u201d calls from April and August when the stock was below RM3.50, Bloomberg data show. It remains to be seen if Press Metal will provide reasons for further bullishness but the stock did reach RM5.47 intraday on Dec 4, although its highest close so far was RM5.184 on Nov 6. \u00a0 Nomura Research\u2019s Tushar Mohata\u2019s call on Sunway Construction Group Bhd In a nutshell, this is a winning call because the stock price ran shortly after an upgrade to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201chold\u201d. But there\u2019s more depth than that. When Nomura Research\u2019s Tushar Mohata upgraded Sunway Construction Group Bhd to \u201cbuy\u201d on March 9 this year, the share price rose 45% within nine months to as high as RM2.41 on Dec 11, before retracing to RM2.38 on Dec 15. Before the upgrade, the stock price had largely been hovering between RM1.50 and RM1.60 for about a year. His decision to upgrade Sunway Construction resulted from what he calls an \u201cearnings-cash flow matrix\u201d as well as \u201cthe law of diminishing returns\u201d at a time when most construction companies were already sitting on record-sized order books. A high base means small and medium-sized project awards could mean very little incremental impact on future earnings and share price. That came after he revisited Nomura\u2019s investment thesis for the Malaysian construction sector. While net profit remains the best long-term predictor for stock price returns, he told clients that the cash conversion of reported earnings was becoming equally important due to rising gearing in a weak property market. The latter was the reason Tushar preferred pure-play Malaysian contractors like Sunway Construction to diversified contractors with exposure to property development. According to him, Sunway Construction\u2019s earnings \u201cfairly accurately track its actual cash flows, reflective of its healthy margins and timely collection from customers\u201d. That\u2019s a better position than companies which may have good reported earnings but subpar conversion of it to operating cash flow due to reasons such as non-cash earnings stream and growing working capital, which leads to higher gearing (thus burdening the balance sheet). A notable mention also goes to Macquarie Research\u2019s Aiman Mohamad, who has had a \u201cbuy\u201d call on Sunway Construction since at least March 2016, according to Bloomberg data. Both Nomura and Macquarie currently have the street\u2019s most bullish target price of RM2.80. \u00a0 Affin Hwang Capital Research\u2019s Kevin Low\u2019s call on Inari Amertron Bhd Inari Amertron saw its stock price more than double this year. Affin Hwang\u2019s Kevin Low, started coverage as early as April 23, 2013, when the comparable stock price was 16 sen. He continues to like Inari, calling it a \u201cpreferred pick\u201d for the local technology sector due to its \u201csolid growth in the RF segment given new drivers, including the Osram IRIS IR chip, and its data server chip business from Broadcom\u201d. Key downside risks to his recommendation include a slowdown in global demand for smart devices, rapid average sale price (ASP) erosion, loss of customer base and the introduction of new technologies that may render Inari\u2019s products obsolete. According to Bloomberg data, there is currently one \u201cfully valued\u201d call from DBS Vickers with a RM2.25 target price. Six analysts have \u201chold\u201d or \u201cneutral\u201d calls on Inari while the remaining six (including Low) recommend as \u201cbuy\u201d. Time will tell who will prove prescient this time next year. This year, a notable mention also goes to Macquarie Research\u2019s Anand Pathmakanthan, as clients would have benefited from his upgrade from \u201cneutral\u201d to \u201coutperform\u201d in January when the stock price was RM1.60. Similarly, RHB Research\u2019s Kong Heng Siong upgraded his call to \u201cbuy\u201d when the stock price was RM1.90 on March 22. Credit Suisse\u2019s Danny Chan, who started coverage with an \u201coutperform\u201d call on July 11 when the stock was at RM2.13 apiece, also deserves a notable mention. \u00a0 \u00a0 Affin Hwang Capital Research\u2019s Kevin Low\u2019s call on KESM Industries Bhd When starting coverage on KESM Industries on Aug 15, 2016, Affin Hwang\u2019s Kevin Low told clients the company was a good proxy for the stable and growing automotive semiconductor segment, going by growing demand for electronics for vehicles from safety to infotainment and autonomous vehicles. In just four months, the stock has gained 34% \u2014 making him a winner last year. He continues his winning ways this year: at RM19.50 on Dec 15, KESM shares had doubled from the start of the year \u2014 and there\u2019s still upside if Low\u2019s RM21.80 target price is to be believed. In fact, KESM reached as high as RM20.50 intraday on Nov 23 before closing at RM20.40. \u201cWe favour KESM for its exposure to the automotive space, an area we believe will continue to benefit from structural growth underpinned by increased semiconductor content in automobiles as well as growth in demand for hybrid and autonomous vehicles,\u201d Low wrote in a Dec 18 note, reiterating his \u201cbuy\u201d call. In an earlier note dated Nov 24, he told clients that KESM\u2019s revenue and earnings momentum \u201cremained strong\u201d, underpinned by aggressive capital expenditure into the automotive burn and test business. He also noted that 1QFY7/2018 net profit would have been stronger if not for higher effective tax rate of 15.5% versus 10.4% in 1QFY7/2017. Key downside risks include a loss of customers and a reduction in the outsourcing opportunities as customers increase their in-house burn-in and test function, he says. Two other analysts have since started coverage on KESM this year, according to Bloomberg data. CIMB Research has an \u201cadd\u201d rating and RM22 target price while Kenanga Research is going against consensus with an \u201cunderperform\u201d call and RM18.40 target price, which is below open market prices. It would be interesting to see if Low will make it a hat trick next year. \u00a0 \u00a0 KAF Seagroatt & Campbell Securities\u2019 Mak Hoy Ken\u2019s call on Econpile Holdings Bhd Econpile Holdings shares have gained as much as 77.6% this year, closing at RM3.195 on Dec 4. Even measured from this year\u2019s cut-off date of Dec 15, gains came to an enviable 73%. In a Dec 29 note last year, KAF\u2019s Mak Hoy Ken retained his \u201cbuy\u201d call. He sees Econpile as the research house\u2019s \u201ctop small-cap construction pick for its burgeoning order book, sustained job momentum and attractive margins\u201d. The civil engineering contractor\u2019s market capitalisation breached RM1 billion in late October 2016. Back then, he also told clients that more strategic opportunities could stem from Econpile\u2019s 60:40 tie-up with China Communications Construction Co (M) Sdn Bhd (CCCC) for a substructure and ancillary works package for SUKE highway, as it was a strong endorsement of Econpile\u2019s position as a piling specialist in Malaysia. At the time of writing, Mak\u2019s target price of RM3.33 implies only 7% upside potential from RM3.11 on Dec 15. It remains to be seen just how much comfort should be drawn from his Oct 20 note, where he said Econpile\u2019s earnings visibility \u201cremains solid, backed by a healthy outstanding order book of RM1.2 billion or around 2.1 times its construction revenue\u201d. Meanwhile, Macquarie Research\u2019s Aiman Mohamad, who started coverage with an \u201coutperform\u201d call on Feb 23 this year when the stock price was at RM2.07 apiece, also deserves a notable mention, with Econpile shares up 50.2% to RM3.11 apiece in about 10 months. Macquarie has a RM3.50 target price. \u00a0 \nKAF Seagroatt & Campbell Securities\u2019 Mak Hoy Ken\u2019s call on Ann Joo Resources Bhd With shares of Ann Joo Resources Bhd up 83% to RM3.80 as at Dec 15 this year, investors who bought the stock at the start of the year would be sitting on good portfolio gains. KAF\u2019s Mak Hoy Ken maintained a \u201cbuy\u201d on the stock with a higher target price of RM2.42 (from RM2.38) on Jan 5. The stock dipped to RM2.17 \u2014 its lowest this year \u2014 on Jan 3. At its peak, it closed as high as RM3.91 on Nov 9. Back then, Ann Joo\u2019s share price had just gained 224% in 2016 and there were doubts in the market on whether the stock would continue to perform, especially with the direction of international steel prices being mixed at best. Mak was held to his belief that there was more upside to Ann Joo. Among other things, he argued that domestic steel prices would see support from provisional safeguard duties on imported bars and wire rods. With the counter trading at only eight to 10 times forward earnings multiples, he was convinced it was a cheaper alternative play to the Malaysian infrastructure supercycle. There is also a potential lift from a continued recovery in Chinese steel prices as capacity cuts in that country gathers pace. Chinese steel prices have been on a general upward trend this year as the country\u2019s supply-side reforms took effect. A notable mention goes to Maybank Investment Bank Research\u2019s Lee Yen Ling, who upgraded her call for Ann Joo on Aug 16, 2016, when the stock price was at RM1.72. At the time of writing, Maybank\u2019s Lee has since downgraded her call to \u201chold\u201d with a RM3.85 target price while KAF\u2019s Mak continues to call a \u201cbuy\u201d with a RM4.10 target price. Watch this space. \u00a0 \nKenanga Research\u2019s Desmond Chong\u2019s call on Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd It was almost as if he had a crystal ball. When Kenanga Research\u2019s Desmond Chong upgraded his call on Malaysian Pacific Industries (MPI) from \u201cmarket perform\u201d to \u201cbuy\u201d on Jan 27, the stock price ran up 79% from RM7.97 to RM14.291 on Oct 11. Helping the gains were the better sales that MPI was seeing of its automotive electronics and power management chips as well as improved efficiency. He subsequently raised his target price three more times to as high as RM15.70 on Aug 18. That\u2019s not all. When Chong turned cautious on its outlook and downgraded MPI to \u201cmarket perform\u201d or a neutral stance on Nov 10, the stock price retraced 12% fromRM13.64 to RM12 on Dec 15. In a Nov 10 note issued following a briefing, he highlighted the \u201cmounting pressure on margins\u201d coupled with a potential setback from a longer gestation period for its product rationalisation exercise. A special mention also goes to KAF Seagroatt & Campbell Securities\u2019 Shafiq Kadir and TA Securities\u2019s Paul Yap, who earlier had \u201cbuy\u201d calls that also proved right. Kenanga\u2019s call got more points as MPI shares ran shortly after his upgrade compared with the two existing \u201cbuy\u201d calls. All three currently have \u201chold\u201d calls on MPI, in line with consensus. At the time of writing, Affin Hwang Capital Research had the only \u201csell\u201d on the stock, with a target price of RM12, according to Bloomberg data. Will he have the last laugh next year? \u00a0 \nUOB Kay Hian Research\u2019s Ridhwan Effendy\u2019s call on Kerjaya Prospek Group Bhd Investors who made money might recall that UOB Kay Hian\u2019s retail research team started coverage on Kerjaya Prospek as far back as January 2016 when it was still called Fututech Bhd. The team called the stock \u201can upcoming mid-cap construction company\u201d that would emerge as an end-to-end building contractor with RM2.7 billion order book after completing the acquisition of two privately-run construction companies. At the time, the (adjusted) stock price was RM1.69. As at Dec 15, it had gained 134% to RM3.97, although that is off as high as RM4.08 on Nov 3. This year, alone, Kerjaya shares were up 83% at the time of writing. On Jan 3, UOB\u2019s Ridhwan Effendy told clients that 2017 would continue to be an eventful year for Kerjaya \u2014 which stands out as a potential capital management play \u2014 given its strong cash pile of RM107 million or 10% of its market capitalisation back then. According to Bloomberg data at the time of writing, UOB is the only house still calling a \u201cbuy\u201d on Kerjaya, while the remaining two houses with active coverage have \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cunderperform\u201d. The \u201cunderperform\u201d call, made in early August when the share price was RM3.54, but the stock is at RM3.97 currently. UOB upgraded the stock to \u201cbuy\u201d again on Nov 23 with a higher target price of RM4.53 (from RM3.81) after raising its earnings estimates as well as order book win assumptions. Ridhwan continues to like Kerjaya for its superior margins, high order book cover, net cash of RM163 million (28.9 sen per share) and ability to clinch new contracts. \u00a0 \nUOB Kay Hian Research\u2019s Ridhwan Effendy\u2019s call on Sunsuria Bhd UOB Kay Hian was the first house to initiate coverage on Sunsuria nearly three years ago. At the time, the headline recommendation was \u201chold\u201d, based on a 50% discount to its sum-of-parts valuation.\u00a0 Nonetheless, the research house told clients that it expected the company to take on a major asset acquisition strategy: \u201cInvestors with the risk appetite for small-caps should consider re-entering ahead of the announcement which is expected to be in 1Q2015,\u201d it said in a brief note dated Feb 18, 2015. That gives this submission an edge over others. Based on where the stock is today post the corporate developments, the equivalent (adjusted) stock price would be 86.8 sen. A simplistic measurement would show a 78.6% gain at its recent peak of RM1.55 on July 14, 2017. UOB Kay Hian\u2019s Ridhwan Effendy raised his target price to RM1.25 (from RM1) when reiterating a \u201cbuy\u201d call on Jan 12 this year as he expected Sunsuria to enter a multi-year growth phase. Riding on the success of Xiamen University, Ridhwan expects its flagship Sunsuria City development to be a key driver for sales and earnings. Sunsuria\u2019s stock price took only about a month to reach the new target price and on Feb28, Ridhwan raised the target price to RM1.50 \u2014 which the stock hit on April 10 before retracing to RM1.40-levels. On May 25, Ridhwan downgraded the stock to \u201chold\u201d with an unchanged target price after the release of the company\u2019s 2QFY2017 earnings, telling investors to \u201ccapitalise on their gains\u201d as he believed its near-term potential had been reflected after a 42% year-to-date climb.\u00a0 At the time, the stock price was RM1.41 and the highest it went was a 9.9% rise to a recent high of RM1.55 on July 17 before retracing to RM1.34, about 5% lower than at the point of downgrade. \u00a0 \nAmInvestment Bank Research\u2019s Alex Goh\u2019s call on Petronas Gas Bhd AmInvestment Bank\u2019s Alex Goh got it right when he cut Petronas Gas to \u201csell\u201d from \u201chold\u201d on Nov 18 with a RM16.65 target price while the stock was trading at RM20-levels. From there, the price skidded 22% to as low as RM15.88 on Nov 30. The magnitude of the fall is considerably sharp, given that Petronas Gas is a big-cap counter with a market capitalisation of RM33.6 billion. In fact, between Nov 18 last year and the recent low on Nov 30, it lost a whopping RM10.1 billion in market capitalisation. When downgrading his call more than a year ago, Goh told clients about the chances of impending earnings erosion given the Energy Commission\u2019s upcoming plan to implement incentive-based regulation (IBR) tariffs on the group\u2019s gas transport tariff. That made it hard to justify the company\u2019s valuation and share price of above RM20. On Dec 5, Goh seemed to have also rightly upgraded Petronas Gas to a \u201chold\u201d with a RM16.65 target price when the share price was at RM16.10. Closing at RM16.96 on Dec 21, the stock had gained 5.3%. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that TA Securities\u2019 analyst Kylie Chan also had a \u201csell\u201d call on the stock, according to Bloomberg data, when many others on the street still said \u201chold\u201d. \u00a0 \nInter-Pacific Securities Research\u2019s Wong Ling Ling\u2019s call on Uchi Technologies Bhd 2017 has been a spectacular year for Uchi Technology, as was Inter-Pacific Securities Research\u2019s Wong Ling Ling\u2019s \u201cbuy\u201d call on the company. The company\u2019s share price had gained between 13% and 30% a year between 2012 and 2016 and this year was beginning to look that way as well until a sharp rally occurred from the middle of the year, barely a fortnight from the time she started coverage on the stock with a \u201cbuy\u201d call. Uchi\u2019s performance likely surprised even her. Only three analysts are actively tracking Uchi, according to Bloomberg data. When Wong started coverage on June 15, Uchi shares were at RM1.84 a share. From there, it rocketed 93% in just over five months to RM3.55 on Nov 29. At RM3.45 on Dec 15, Uchi\u2019s market capitalisation stood at RM1.57 billion compared with about RM800 million just six months earlier. Wong\u2019s \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation was premised on the company\u2019s stable earnings growth, unique business model, a minimum dividend payout ratio of 70% of profit after tax, very comfortable profit margins and a clientele comprised of industry market leaders. It would be interesting to see if Uchi, which specialises in the design of electronic control systems for a number of multinational companies that are global leaders in their respective industries, can continue to surprise on the upside next year. \u00a0 \nHong Leong Investment Bank Research\u2019s Jeremy Goh\u2019s call on George Kent (M) Bhd This time last year, HLIB Research\u2019s Jeremy Goh was the only analyst actively tracking George Kent, telling clients that the water meter-turned-engineering company had RM5.1 billion engineering order book and \u201ccan no longer be ignored\u201d. Today, he is one of three analysts calling a \u201cbuy\u201d on the company he described as one with 68 sen per share net cash and a \u201ckey rail play with exposure to the LRT extensions\u201d. His target price is currently RM3.90. Closing at RM3.62 on Dec 15, George Kent shares had gained 83% year to date, continuing its ascent from the year before. In a Dec 7 note after the company\u2019s third quarter earnings briefing, Goh noted that George Kent \u2014 which is the leader for water meters in Malaysia, with over a 50% market share \u2014 could see the opening of \u201ca whole new market\u201d for itself when it commercialises its automated meter reading (AMR) product, which allows remote reading of water meters. Selangor is expected to call tenders for AMR meters in two months for a pilot project while Johor and Penang are also looking to replace traditional meters, Goh said. The company (via a joint venture with Siemens) is also preparing to put in a bid for the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail (HSR) asset company (AssetsCo) that will help develop key parts of the project. That may provide further catalysts for the stock next year. \u00a0 \nUOB Kay Hian Research\u2019s Kong Ho Meng\u2019s call on Sapura Energy Bhd When analysts rushed to revise their \u201cbuy\u201d and \u201cneutral\u201d calls on Sapura Energy Bhd in early December, after a large quarterly net loss, UOB Kay Hian Research\u2019s Kong Ho Meng stood out as he had had a \u201csell\u201d call for close to six months. The stock tumbled 20% in a single day on Dec 7, after the group announced a quarterly net loss of RM274.4 million for the third quarter ended Oct 31, a sharp contrast to a net profit of RM158 million the year before. Looking back, we see that the share price had in fact been drifting lower since mid-June when the consensus view was that the oil\u00a0 and gas giant was in calmer waters as the recovery of global crude oil prices gathered steam. Kong\u2019s timely downgrade of his call from \u201cneutral\u201d to \u201csell\u201d on June 20 would have saved clients from sizeable portfolio losses. From RM1.67, the stock price tumbled 53% to 78.5 sen at our award evaluation cut-off date of Dec 15. When The Edge went to print, the stock price had slid further to a record low of 71.5 sen on Dec 21. A notable mention goes to Credit Suisse\u2019s Danny Chan, who also went against the grain with a contrarian \u201csell\u201d call since June, although he prematurely upped his recommendation to \u201cneutral\u201d while the counter was still heading south. \u00a0 \nAffin Hwang Capital Research\u2019s Ng Chi Hoong\u2019s call on Jaks Resources Bhd Jaks Resources is not well tracked by analysts, many of whom may feel the need to observe the company from the sidelines for the time being since its power generation project in Vietnam will only start contributing in 2020 and be a good source of recurring income. The lack of coverage makes Affin Hwang Capital\u2019s Ng Chi Hoong\u2019s \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation and analysis stand out even more. Those familiar with the company would know Jaks is undertaking a US$1.87 billion 1,200MW coal-fired thermal power plant project near Hai Duong, together with China Power Engineering Consulting Group Co Ltd (CPECC). Jaks holds a 30% stake in the joint venture and CPECC the remaining 70%. In a Jan 4 note, Ng raised his target price for Jaks to RM2 (from RM1.60) following a review of its assets after the company said it was realigning its focus on Vietnam given the slowdown in the property market in Malaysia. At the time, Jaks\u2019 share price was at RM1.01. It took barely three months to jump 70% to reach RM1.72 on April 5 before retracing. Following the strong rally, Ng downgraded his call to \u201chold\u201d on May 25 when the price was RM1.58. When it skidded to RM1.38 on Oct 17, however, he saw reason to upgrade to \u201cbuy\u201d again with RM1.75 target price. Jaks closed at RM1.50 as at Dec 20, up 48.5% from the time Ng reiterated his \u201cbuy\u201d call with a higher target price. A special mention goes to Affin\u2019s Lim Yee Tang, who initiated coverage on Jaks before he moved to equity sales. Ng assumed coverage from November 2016. \u00a0 \nKenanga Research\u2019s Raymond Choo\u2019s call on Hartalega Holdings Bhd At the start of 2017, Kenanga Investment Research\u2019s Raymond Choo boldly recommended that clients buy Hartalega Holdings shares. He was the only one of 20 analysts tracking the stock to do so, according to Bloomberg data. In fact, there was as many as five \u201csell\u201d calls. The lack of enthusiasm may have stemmed from the fact that Hartalega shares were down 17% year on year in 2016 after gaining 72% y-o-y in 2015. A long-time favourite of investors, the leading nitrile glove maker sprang a surprise rebound this year, rising more than120%. The stock moved from RM4.76 as at end-2016 to RM9.75 on Dec 15, our award evaluation cut-off date. As at Dec 20, the stock price reached RM11.40! Investors who bought shares early this year would have Choo to thank. His contrarian stance stemmed from the conviction that Hartalega was capitalising on its new capacity from the NGC plant in Sepang on the back of robust demand and a slower-than-expected production ramp-up in the other rubber glove players. He was convinced by Hartalega\u2019s constant desire to move up the value chain by offering superior product innovation and automating its production processes. Hartalega\u2019s recently announced first non-leaching antimicrobial nitrile examination glove is also expected to be a game changer in the rubber glove industry. Inter-Pacific Securities\u2019 David Lai Yoon Hui also deserves a notable mention for also having a \u201cbuy\u201d for the most part, save for a blip in May. \u00a0 \nMIDF Research\u2019s Ng Bei Shan\u2019s call on Superlon Holdings Bhd At its peak, Superlon Holdings Bhd\u2019s market capitalisation reached RM463.7 million when its share price rose to RM2.92 on Sept 18. While some institutional investors may consider this small, the market cap is already more than double the RM202.47 million the company was valued at on Nov 22 last year \u2014 the day MIDF Research\u2019s Ng Bei Shan initiated coverage on the maker of synthetic rubber insulators used mainly for heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC) and refrigeration \u2014 which are important for high-rise buildings and industrial use. The recommendation was based on the prospects for its new warehouse, which would improve lead time and sales; market dominance; and its sturdy balance sheet (RM39.13 million net cash) that spelt dividend payments. In fact, MIDF had been watching Superlon for some months, starting with a non-rated report in March 2016, when its market cap stood at RM159.6 million. Measured from Nov 21, 2016, the share price appreciated as much as 137% to reach RM2.92 on Sept 11 this year. Part of the gains were thanks to a share split that the company had hoped would improve liquidity \u2014 a move that was rewarded with the entry of institutional investors, including the emergence of Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) as a substantial shareholder with a 10.49% stake. Closing at RM2.15 on Dec 15, the counter had skidded 26% from its recent peak but it remains about 75% above the time MIDF started calling a \u201cbuy\u201d. Ng, who had downgraded the stock to \u201cneutral\u201d on Sept 27, when her target price was nearly met and its 1QFY2018 earnings were hit by a spike in raw material price, upgraded her call again to \u201cbuy\u201d on Dec 15 following the share price weakness. At the time of writing, its RM2.36 target price implies 9.8% upside potential from current levels.\u00a0 \u00a0 \nAffin Hwang Capital Research\u2019s Tan Jian Yuan\u2019s call on Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd If you had bought Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd shares when Affin Hwang Research\u2019s Tan Jian Yuan started coverage with a \u201cbuy\u201d and RM2.40 target price, you would have seen your holdings rise 67.7% over seven months from RM1.76 to RM3.22 on Dec 15. That\u2019s if you did not get the initial public offering (IPO) shares for Serba Dinamik, which made a strong debut on the Main Market on Feb 8 this year and went on to become the year\u2019s best-performing IPO with a gain of 119% as at Dec 15. Kenanga Investment Bank was the IPO lead manager. When Tan started tracking Serba Dinamik about two months from its debut, the stock price had already appreciated 10% from its IPO price. Yet he was convinced that there was at least 45% more upside potential \u2014 and was proved right. At the time, Tan was upbeat on its growth potential, expecting strong maintenance activity growth and expansion of engineering, procurement, construction and contracting (EPCC) revenue to drive forward earnings. He also expected the group to pay out 25% to 30% of net profits in FY2017 to FY2019, translating into decent yields of3.3% to 5.2%, the initiation report read. A notable mention goes to RHB Research Institute\u2019s Wan Mohd Zahidi, who initiated coverage on May 8 with a RM2.78 target price when the stock price was at RM1.92, as well as Alliance DBS Research\u2019s Inani Rozidin, who initiated coverage on May 16 this year with a RM2.90 target price when the stock was at RM2. Investors would also have made good money following their recommendations, despite the later initiation dates. At the time of writing, Tan\u2019s RM4 target price shows that he remains among the most bullish of all seven analysts calling a \u201cbuy\u201d while RHB\u2019s is the lowest at RM3.10 \u00a0"}, "174": {"date_posted": "4January2018", "title": "Pre-election rally may be getting started", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia\u2019s stock market showed first signs of the much-anticipated pre-election rally yesterday, as market breadth turned bullish with 771 stocks advanced compared with 305 declines. Trading volume surpassed five billion shares for the first time since March last year, with 5.11 billion shares worth RM3.68 billion traded yesterday compared with Tuesday\u2019s 3.7 billion shares worth RM2.11 billion. This has prompted some analysts to suggest a pre-election rally could be at play. Stocks likely to benefit in the run-up to the 14th general election (GE14) also moved to the upside yesterday. Shares in Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB) climbed 7.8% to RM1.25, while DRB-Hicom Bhd traded up 1.8% to RM2.30. My EG Services Bhd (MyEG) gained more than 10% to RM2.46, and was among the top gainers. UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd shares rose 1.5% to 33 sen, while KUB Malaysia Bhd added 3.5% to 44.5 sen and Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd (FGV) shares were up 3.3% at RM1.86. \u201cThe stock market is showing a very positive trend upwards as volume hit 5.1 billion shares, while close to 800 counters were in positive territory. It is likely the momentum is in anticipation of the country\u2019s general election [taking place] in the first half of this year,\u201d Hong Leong Investment Bank head of retail research Loui Low told The Edge Financial Daily on the phone yesterday. This means the dissolution of parliament is likely to happen in February. Historically, the Malaysian equity market would see a rally before parliament is dissolved. Maybank Investment Bank head of research Wong Chew Hann said there could be a combination of factors contributing to yesterday\u2019s strong market performance, noting that regional markets were also on an uptrend. \u201cForeign investors have also turned net buyers recently, favourable to the equity market,\u201d she told The Edge Financial Daily. In Maybank Kim Eng Research\u2019s regional research report dated Jan 2, Wong is expecting a period of volatility in equities and the ringgit in the run-up to, and post polling day, with a sizeable political newsflow possibly having an impact on investors\u2019 sentiments. \u201cAssuming parliament is dissolved just after the Chinese New Year (Feb 16 and 17), we could potentially see higher activity in equities from January to [the] GE14 and some trading opportunities may manifest. \u201cOur end-2018 FBM KLCI target of 1,840 points is based on 15.6 times 12-month forward earnings,\u201d she added. Affin Hwang Asset Management director of equity strategies and advisory Gan Eng Peng pointed out yesterday\u2019s spike in the stock market was initially seen on a few politically-linked counters such as MRCB, DRB-Hicom and FGV, which quickly spread to the rest of the market. \u201cRetail participation was much higher than normal. This is probably the early stages of a second-tier rally. We expect active rotation among the names at high volume and this is a trading market,\u201d Gan said via a text message. CIMB Investment Bank head of Malaysia Research Ivy Ng also opines that yesterday\u2019s strong market performance signals the start of the pre-election rally. \u201cThe strong KLCI performance could be due to the January effect and [the] pre-GE14 rally as a special Barisan Nasional (BN) supreme council meeting will be held today (yesterday) to discuss the preparations for GE14. January is historically a good month for Bursa Malaysia and historically, it has chalked up a gain of 1.9% month-on-month over the past 40 years,\u201d Ng told The Edge Financial Daily via an email. Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of research Vincent Lau concurs. \u201cThis could be the beginning of the much anticipated pre-election rally. There was [a] news report talking about a special BN supreme council meeting on the preparations for the upcoming election. Most investors probably didn\u2019t want to miss out on the rally and the positive sentiment eventually spilled over to the broader market. If you look at companies such as KUB, FGV, MyEG and MRCB, most of them are starting to pick up. \u201cI think this is just the start of the anticipated pre-election rally and there are still legs for the market to go further,\u201d Lau said on the phone. He also opines that the current market provides a good opportunity for investors to trade, with the KLCI on track to breach the 1,800-point level. The KLCI closed up 10.09 points or 0.57% at 1,792.79 yesterday. However, Inter-Pacific Securities Sdn Bhd head of research Pong Teng Siew believes the stock market rally is not sustainable, recommending investors to take profit now as trading volume hovers above five billion shares. \u201cThe last time we saw volume traded over six billion shares was in March last year. So, if the market continues to see higher volume in the near term, it is better to take profit and by the end of the month, you should have taken all the profit that you can,\u201d he said. Rather, Pong reckons yesterday\u2019s strong market performance was the result of continuous stimulus programmes by central banks worldwide except that in the US. \u201cThe [global] market was very unnatural today (yesterday). Practically everywhere is going through an upswing cycle including in Malaysia due to the stimulus programme from central banks around the world. Markets are awashed with money; investors are reacting the only way they can \u2014 being bullish,\u201d he said. Pong opines that the market is overbought despite the good economic indicators in the country, as they did not translate into better corporate earnings during the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2017. He also noted that cost escalation was obvious for Malaysian companies as observed from the quarterly results. A fund manager with a local asset management reckons local institutional funds will gradually take profit as the election date draws closer. \u201cThis (strong market performance) was obviously the beginning of the pre-election rally. We could take advantage of the rally by taking some profits as we approach the election. \u201cWhile it appears that the incumbents are on a stronger footing now, the risk of an unprecedented victory by the opposition at the ballot box has not been priced in. There will be a knee-jerk reaction if that happens, and we don\u2019t want to be caught off guard. I think when parliament is dissolved, foreign investors could turn net sellers or stay on the sidelines,\u201d he said."}, "175": {"date_posted": "3January2018", "title": "Capital: Broker Write - Eyeing pockets of opportunity ahead", "article": " By KENNY YEE Head of research, Rakuten Trade BURSA Malaysia has had a \u201cJekyll and Hyde\u201d performance this year. The FBM KLCI touched a high of 1,796.75 points before retreating to the current levels, amid subdued participation from foreign investors. At the height of the local bourse\u2019s performance, total inflow of foreign funds surpassed the RM12 billion mark but the amount has dwindled to RM10.2 billion currently. Nonetheless, following the rather severe foreign outflow in August, September and October, we noticed that foreign participation gathered momentum in December \u2014 foreign inflow passed the RM800 million threshold, and counting, at the time of writing. Thus, we expect the Malaysian stock market to experience improved trading activities in the first quarter of next year in the run-up to the general election. The recently released corporate results for 3Q2017 were unexciting, hence the more conservative stance adopted by the research fraternity. Despite the prevailing lacklustre performance of Bursa Malaysia, we believe interest will return when the realignment of portfolios takes place, thus we maintain our positive stance on the benchmark index. We remain staunch advocates of a stronger ringgit as the currency is still the most undervalued in the region. It has the closest correlation to the renminbi/US dollar movements, and we reckon this could only be positive for the ringgit going forward as the renminbi is set to gain its momentum vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar. We see the ringgit re-testing 4.00 against the US dollar and thereafter, to around the 3.80 level. Our main concern over the local bourse would be the bubble on Wall Street, which may derail investors\u2019 confidence, especially during the quantitative tightening. As for next year, we see pockets of opportunities in the local bourse. We expect the strengthening of the ringgit to be an important catalyst as foreign funds may consider this as a strong pull factor to preserve their investments in the country. It is interesting that the ringgit has remained steadfast over the last few months despite the weakness in the domestic equity market. Foreign funds had liquidated their equity positions for the August to October period \u2014 totalling RM1.6 billion of foreign outflows. Notwithstanding this, we believe foreign monies are staying put in the domestic financial system and are expected to return to the equity market anytime soon. Additionally, we may see fresh foreign funds entering the country as the local asset class offers more stability compared with others in the region \u2014 we have underperformed the region. We reckon foreign participation will heighten since the valuation of the FBM KLCI is deemed attractive compared with its regional peers\u2019. Thus, we expect the FBM KLCI to chart above 1,900 next year, with our target of 1,910 premised on a market valuation of 16 times and corporate earnings growth of 6.6%, supported by the banking sector that is projected to see earnings expand 8.3% next year. As seen in the table, the FBM KLCI\u2019s valuations are still at reasonable levels \u2014 the index is trading below its five-year average while the rest, except for Singapore, are currently above or on a par with their respective five-year average PER. Meanwhile, from a macro perspective, Brent crude has improved to above US$63 \u2014 an 11% improvement from the start of the year. This is a positive sign for the Budget 2018 as it was tabled based on crude prices of US$52 a barrel. This provides the government with some buffer when administering its expenditure going forward, without putting pressure on the fiscal deficit. For 2018, private consumption and construction activities, which are envisaged to grow at 7.5% and 6.8% respectively, are expected to be the main impetus to drive domestic economic activities. As for the performance of the sectors, even though there are no obvious outperformers, we favour the banking, construction and consumer sectors. Banks: Despite the outlook being clouded by concerns over MFRS9 on potential higher credit costs, loan growth is expected to be decent and is projected to grow 4% to 5% next year, spearheaded by household loans. We expect corporate loans/financing to moderate next year with corporates opting for the debt market for financing to mitigate the impact of higher interest rates. We still see good value propositions from Affin Holdings Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Hong Leong Bank Bhd, RHB Bank Bhd and Malayan Banking Bhd. Construction: We expect construction news flow to improve in CY2018, predominantly from high-profile mega projects, namely the Pan Borneo Highway and East Coast Rail Line (ECRL). The ECRL (RM55 billion) has been pushed into the limelight after the release of Budget 2018 \u2014 the project is to be carried out next year. Other transport-related projects such as the Mass Rapid Transit Line 2 (RM32 billion), Light Rail Transit Line 3 (RM9 billion) and Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail (RM50 billion to RM60 billion) will also be in focus next year. We reckon recent market weakness presents an excellent opportunity for an accumulation exercise and we prefer the likes of Advancecon Holdings Bhd, Ahmad Zaki Resources Bhd, Gamuda Bhd, HSS Engineers Bhd, IJM Corp Bhd and Kerjaya Prospek Group Bhd. Consumer: The retail sub-segment is expected to experience some improvement next year on the back of a 1% reduction in personal income tax. Though the impact may be muted, we reckon the marginal improvement in disposable income will lead to more demand for household necessities. Meanwhile, the stronger ringgit may play a part in terms of cheaper imports, hence potential margins expansion, particularly for players with a high import content. Our picks within this sector include Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd, Bison Consolidated Bhd, 7-Eleven Malaysia Holdings Bhd and Power Root Bhd. In view of the possible improvement in trading participation going forward, we believe interest in the small/mid-cap space will follow suit accordingly, buoyed by the pickup in liquidity in the local bourse. Thus, for those seeking the \u201calpha-play\u201d, we advocate that they look at fundamentally sound smaller-cap companies such as Advancecon, AZRB, HSS, Kelington Group Bhd, KUB Malaysia Bhd, Perak Transit Bhd and Straits Inter Logistics Bhd, which are looking attractive following recent price weaknesses. For those keen on the bigger caps, we like British American Tobacco (M) Bhd, Lotte Chemical Titan Holding Bhd, Petronas Gas Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd.\u00a0 \u00a0"}, "176": {"date_posted": "2January2018", "title": "Best Privatisation: Century Bond\u2019s minorities get the elusive \u2018fair deal\u2019", "article": " THIS year, the soft stock market prompted a number of privatisations \u2014 some were successful, some were not. As the offeror \u2014 or offerors as the case may be \u2014 often attempt to take companies private at the lowest price possible, it is not surprising that many of the deals were deemed \u201cnot fair\u201d by independent advisers, even if the prices were \u201creasonable\u201d. This was one reason, at least, that made Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor Bhd\u2019s (KPS) privatisation of Century Bond Bhd the privatisation of the year. At the time, Century Bond was a paper packaging manufacturer and a leader in cement packaging with a 60% market share. The deal, which was led by CIMB Investment Bank Bhd, was concluded on Jan 18 when Century Bond was delisted after it was taken private by KPS\u2019 wholly-owned subsidiary, Perangsang Packaging Sdn Bhd. The deal, completed at the end of last year, did not create meaningful synergistic value for the acquirer. After all, KPS had minimal operations in the sector and Perangsang Packaging itself was merely set up for the purpose of undertaking the RM194 million acquisition. Instead, KPS used the deal to put its balance sheet to work. Channel checks reveal that the privatisation was largely funded by debt that KPS was able to secure at highly competitive rates. Couple that with Century Bond\u2019s stable earnings and strong operational cash flow that branded the company a \u201ccash cow asset\u201d and KPS was set to make a modest spread from the acquisition. It fact, it is learnt that Century Bond\u2019s management is still relatively intact, ensuring that it will be business as usual at the company. Looking back, the privatisation took place in two stages. It began on Aug 11, 2016, when Perangsang Packaging made a bid to buy 85.73 million shares representing 71.44% equity interest from Century Bond\u2019s controlling shareholders-cum-managers \u2014 the Tan family. Once the shares were acquired, KPS extended a mandatory general offer to all other shareholders at the same price of RM1.75 per share. The offer was deemed both \u201cfair\u201d and \u201creasonable\u201d, according to a report by independent adviser Public Investment Bank Bhd. Compared with the company\u2019s three-month volume weighted average price (VWAP) leading up to the initial announcement to acquire the 71.44% stake, the RM1.75 offer came at an 8.02% premium. Against the six-month VWAP, the offer was at a 12.18% premium. While the premium may seem relatively narrow to privatise a company, it is important to note that Century Bond\u2019s share price enjoyed a relatively strong rally in 2016, prior to the initial offer by Perangsang Packaging. While the premium itself was not exceptional, the offer was relatively compelling from a valuation perspective. The independent advisers valued the firm based on enterprise value against earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EV/Ebitda). At RM1.75 a share, Century Bond was valued at six times EV/Ebitda. This was comparable to valuations of its peers, noted the independent advisers. Muda Holdings Bhd, which had a market capitalisation of RM497.23 million compared with Century Bond\u2019s RM208.8 million, was valued at 7.87 times EV/Ebitda. Its smaller peer, Box-Pak (Malaysia) Bhd, with a market capitalisation of RM121.25 million, was valued at 5.89 times EV/Ebitda. Another peer, Ornapaper Bhd, with a market capitalisation of RM69.7 million, was valued at 4.48 times EV/Ebitda. It should also be noted that Century Bond had been profitable in the five business years prior to the acquisition. Of course, it can be argued that Century Bond managed to command favourable valuations overall because Perangsang Packaging had to buy the 71.44% block from the controlling shareholders in the first place, so the minorities simply got to enjoy the same pricing. In contrast, the other privatisations this year involved controlling shareholders taking their own companies private. One such example was the privatisation of Wing Tai Malaysia Bhd by controlling shareholder and management, Wing Tai Investment & Development Pte Ltd. The deal was advised by Maybank Investment Bank Bhd. The offeror took Wing Tai private at RM1.80 a share, almost 49% lower than its fair value per share of RM3.55 to RM3.59, as estimated by Mercury Securities, the independent adviser. Thus, the offer was considered \u201cnot fair\u201d. However, Mercury Securities added that the offer was \u201creasonable\u201d and that this reasonable aspect outweighed its \u201cnot fair\u201d view. After all, the offer price of RM1.80 was 61.75% higher than the one-year VWAP, argued Mercury Securities. That said, it is important to note that Wing Tai\u2019s share price had been on the decline for almost two years prior to the offer. Another example of a privatisation that was \u201cnot fair\u201d was that of Hwang Capital (Malaysia) Bhd by the Hwang family, led by Hwang Lip Teik. The privatisation had been expected ever since the company\u2019s asset management business was sold in 2014. But after the first offer of RM2.65 per share \u2014 made in late-May 2016 \u2014 failed to go through, the offerors raised the offer price to RM2.94 per share. The deal was advised by Affin Hwang Investment Bank Bhd. While the second offer ultimately succeeded, it was still seen as \u201cnot fair\u201d by independent adviser RHB Investment Bank Bhd. This was because the offer came at a 14% discount to the revised net asset value of the company, which was determined to be RM3.42 per share. However, given that the offer came at a 12.64% premium to the three-month VWAP and there was no competing offer, the advisers deemed it a \u201creasonable\u201d offer. Still, it should be noted that Hwang Capital\u2019s shares had been suspended for over nine months since Sept 2, 2016, before the revised offer was made on June 30, 2017. \u00a0"}, "177": {"date_posted": "2January2018", "title": "Best IPO: Serba Dinamik outperforms despite headwinds", "article": " THE share price performance of Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd this year has been stellar, which is remarkable considering it is an energy services group providing engineering solutions to the still-slow oil and gas sector as well as the power generation industry. From the day it debuted on Bursa Malaysia\u2019s Main Market on Feb 8, its share price has jumped 106.67% to RM3.10 per share as at Dec 21, from the initial public offering price of RM1.50. That makes it the best IPO for 2017. Affin Hwang Investment Bank Bhd and RHB Investment Bank Bhd were the joint principal advisers and joint bookrunners. Both institutions were joint underwriters for the deal, together with AmInvestment Bank Bhd and Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd. RHB IB was also the managing underwriter. Serba Dinamik\u2019s business activities comprise operations and maintenance services (O&M), engineering, procurement, construction and commission (EPCC), and other products and services in O&G and power generation. Its O&M business involves maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) of rotating equipment and inspection, as well as repair and maintenance (IRM) of static equipment and structures. The company is ranked third and fifth in Malaysia for MRO and IRM respectively in the O&G industry. The IPO offered a base size of 389.4 million shares at RM1.50 per share, or RM581.4 million, representing 29.2% of the company\u2019s enlarged share base, with an over-allotment option of 58.4 million shares or RM87.6 million. Serba Dinamik raised RM671.7 million, valuing the group at RM2 billion. At the time, it was touted as the biggest IPO in Malaysia in 19 months in terms of value, before Eco World International Bhd\u2019s listing in April. The IPO proceeds were used primarily for capital expenditure, with the balance going for debt repayment and working capital. The promoters of Serba Dinamik were Datuk Mohd Abdul Karim Abdullah, Datuk Awang Daud Awang Putera and Abdul Kadier Sahib, who collectively owned 83.93% of the group\u2019s share base prior to the IPO. Post-IPO, Serba Dinamik\u2019s largest shareholder is Karim with a 25.27% stake followed by Kadier with 20.77%, while Daud Awang owns 11.7%. Kumpulan Wang Persaraan has a 5.78% stake as at Dec 20, and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) holds 5.3%. Serba Dinamik\u2019s IPO is especially noteworthy since it was launched in a volatile global environment when equity markets were affected by China\u2019s slowdown, Brexit and falling commodity prices, among other factors. Oil prices that remained depressed longer than expected made marketing the exercise even more challenging. Despite the headwinds, the listing was successfully executed within the timeline, and priced at the top of the RM1.30 and RM1.50 per share indicative price range. Since then, the stock has benefitted from rising oil prices over the last 12 months. The production quotas set by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia have boosted the crude oil price to more than US$60 per barrel, from US$45, in the past six months. A month after its debut, the stock closed at RM1.75, up 17% over its final IPO price. By Nov 24, it had almost doubled to RM2.92. Serba Dinamik\u2019s slew of contract wins \u2014 totalling RM2.5 billion as at Nov 30 \u2014 which raised its outstanding order book to RM5.3 billion \u2014 was another major factor that boosted its share price. O&M jobs made up RM4 billion of total orders, with the remaining RM1.3 billion from EPCC contracts. Another listing that deserves notable mention is the April 3 debut of Eco World International (EWI), which combined the joint expertise of Eco World Development Group Bhd \u2014 one of Malaysia\u2019s largest publicly listed property developers \u2014 and Guoco Group, which is among Southeast Asia\u2019s biggest corporations. Guoco Group, through its unit GuocoLand Ltd, took up 27% stake in EWI to become a strategic investor in the international arm of Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin\u2019s property development business. Guoco Group is controlled by Tan Sri Quek Leng Chan. Analysts and investors believe the partnership between Liew and Quek will turn EWI into a formidable property development player in Asia. EWI has projects in Australia and the UK while GuocoLand is an established brand in Malaysia, Singapore, China and Vietnam. EWI raised RM2.58 billion by issuing 2.153 billion shares or 89.7% of the group\u2019s issued and paid-up capital, as well as a bonus issue of 960 million free warrants on the basis of two warrants for every five shares held by EWI shareholders. EWI\u2019s IPO was a landmark deal in both Malaysia and Southeast Asia at the time \u2014 it was the largest local IPO since June 2015 (before Lotte Chemical Titan Holdings Bhd\u2019s IPO later in the year in July, which raised RM3.77 billion), and the largest for a property developer in the region since November 2010, according to Maybank Investment Bank Bhd. Maybank IB, CIMB Investment Bank Bhd and Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) were the joint principal advisers and joint managing underwriters for the deal. They also acted as joint bookrunners, together with UOB KayHian Securities (M) Sdn Bhd. Maybank IB, CIMB IB, HLIB, Alliance Investment Bank Bhd, AmInvestment Bank and RHB IB were the joint underwriters. Besides Guoco Group, the listing also saw Permodalan Nasional Bhd, Kumpulan Wang Persaraan and Employees Provident Fund becoming cornerstone investors of EWI, taking up an aggregate 212.4 million shares, or 8.9% of the enlarged share capital. Securing the country\u2019s top public fund managers anchored the transaction and provided significant momentum for the IPO. Within nine working days of the bookbuilding, it was 8.9 times oversubscribed. \u201cThe offering was a resounding success, with the institutional tranche circa 9 times covered at the top end with no sensitivity across the price range, while demand for the retail tranche available to Malaysian public was circa 9 times oversubscribed,\u201d says Maybank IB. After the IPO, EcoWorld remains the largest shareholder of EWI with a 30.28% stake while Liew owns a direct stake of 10.27%."}, "178": {"date_posted": "2January2018", "title": "Top 10 Stock Picks for 2018", "article": " The Edge Financial Daily\u2019s picks are based on some of the investment themes that fund managers are exploring in 2018. These themes include the turnaround of the badly hit oil and gas industry where many companies\u2019 share prices have tumbled to all-time lows; better corporate earnings growth amid a synchronised global economy recovery; interest rate hikes globally; and a strengthening ringgit. Meanwhile, the e-commence boom that leads to stronger demand for logistics services and improved consumer sentiments that will boost private consumption could also be the buying impetus that drives investors\u2019 interests. We did not make a selection based on the 14th general election theme as most research houses have said the market could return to fundamentals after the election. \u00a0 1. UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd - Bouncing back UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd (UMW O&G) could turn around in 2018 as its earnings recovery is on sight. The country\u2019s biggest jack-up rig operator has returned to the black in the third financial quarter ended Sept 30, 2017 (3QFY17), with a net profit of RM3.4 million, or 0.16 sen per share, compared to a net loss of RM135.4 million, or 6.26 sen per share. UMW O&G has seen its fleet utilisation improve from a dismal average of 21% in the 1QFY16 to 68% and 90% in 2QFY17 and 3QFY17 respectively. According to TA Securities analyst Abel Goon, UMW O&G\u2019s management expects the utilisation rate to be greater than 90% in 4QFY17, while FY18 will realise at least 80% utilisation rate. \u201cFor UMW O&G, one of the key risks is the idling costs incurred. With the utilisation rate now back to about 90% level, the company should see a turnaround in 2018. Although the rates remain at a fairly low level, the company would turn profitable if the management could maintain the utilisation rate,\u201d Goon told The Edge Financial Daily over a phone call. He added that UMW O&G should be able to secure more drilling contracts from Petroliam Nasional Bhd\u2019s (Petronas) prioritising local content. Based on UMW O&G management\u2019s feedback, Goon pointed that Petronas requires at least 12 rigs in Malaysia for FY18. UMW O&G currently has seven premium jack-up rigs generating 99% of the group\u2019s revenue. Further, it is on a stronger financial footing after the completion of RM1.8 billion rights issue. UMW O&G has guided that a one-time write-off of unamortised transaction costs plus potential asset impairment loss arising from a year-end review in 4QFY17 could weigh on its annual earnings for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY17). Goon reckons the market has priced in a large impairment in 4QFY17, which is why the share price remains at a subdued level. At the current price, UMW O&G is trading at about 0.5 times its book value, one standard deviation below its historical average, despite the expected turnaround in its operations, alleviations of short-term liquidity risks and upwards trajectory seen in oil prices. TA Securities has set a target price of 51 sen a share, indicating a potential upside of 67.2% from its closing price of 30.1 sen last Friday. Nonetheless, there remains downside risks for O&G players, especially if the crude oil price sees another sharp decline, which could lead to low utilisation rate. The higher-than-expected finance costs, despite the reduction in borrowings, could also hurt UMW O&G, which has a relatively high gearing level. \u2014 By Billy Toh \u00a0 2. Inari Amertron Bhd - Riding on continuous firm demand Inari Amertron Bhd, one of The Edge Financial Daily\u2019s stock picks for 2017, is also one of the top performers for the year on Bursa Malaysia. It remains as one of our stock picks amid expectations that demand for radio frequency (RF) filters to stay strong despite saturating growth in the global smartphone market. Affin Hwang analyst Kevin Low told The Edge Financial Daily that demand is driven by the increase in bandwidths and complexity in expanding the long-term evolution coverage, and that demand for RF will likely remain robust. Also, Inari\u2019s customer, Broadcom, is a major player in this space. \u201cThe number of Inari\u2019s RF testers grew to 960 units and was projected to reach 1,000 units by end-2017. This had far exceeded our assumptions for FY18 (ending June 30, 2018) to FY20, as we had only expected the 1,000-unit mark to be hit by FY20,\u201d Low said, adding that the Iris IR chip could be Inari\u2019s new earnings driver. Inari achieved a net profit growth of 42.4% in the first financial quarter ended Sept 30, 2017 (1QFY17) to RM68.4 million, from RM48 million in the previous corresponding quarter, mainly due to increased demand for its existing and new products which came on stream during the past two quarters. The positive outlook is also supported by the upward forecast revision on global semiconductor sales by World Semiconductor Trade Statistics, which raised its forecast to an annual growth of 20.6% in 2017 and 7% in 2018. Similarly, other market researchers such as Gartner Inc and IC Insights have revised their forecasts upwards on the semiconductor industry due to exceptional growth in the memory device market. Inari\u2019s share price, which closed at RM3.40 last Friday, has exceeded the average 12-month target price of RM3.09 by analysts based on data compiled by Bloomberg. Despite the optimism on demand, the slowdown in global demand for smart devices, loss of customer base, and the introduction of new technologies may render Inari\u2019s products obsolete and could dampen its earnings prospects. Investors should also pay heed to a recent report on the forecasts cut on Apple\u2019s iPhone X shipment by analysts citing tepid demand. In the last five years, Inari\u2019s investors would have seen an annualise gain of 101.3%. At the current level, the stock is trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio (P/E) of 27 times compared with Apple Inc\u2019s 18 times. Despite the downside risks, Inari has a proven track record with a good management and is a leading RF test house in Asia, which fit into our selections. \u2014 By Billy Toh \u00a0 3. Berjaya Food Bhd - Extra shots from Starbucks Berjaya Food Bhd (BFood) is expected to see its earnings growth moving forward supported by Starbucks due to its store expansion and recovery in same-store sales growth (SSSG). The company will also benefit from a strong ringgit, which will help to expand its profit margin, as up to 50% of its materials are imported. According to the group\u2019s latest financial results, BFood\u2019s net profit grew 15.5% to RM5.8 million in the second financial quarter ended Oct 30, 2017 (2QFY18) from RM5 million a year ago, thanks to higher profit recorded by Starbucks\u2019 operations in Malaysia and lower losses incurred by Kenny Rogers Roaster\u2019s (KRR) operations in Indonesia arising from further closure of non-performing outlets. RHB Research analyst Soong Wei Siang told The Edge Financial Daily that BFood\u2019s management is looking to turn around KRR Malaysia in FY18 and had implemented changes such as introducing a new menu and moderating the prices of dishes served. He said BFood\u2019s management also aims to improve service standards at KRR Malaysia to the level of Starbucks. In previous quarters, BFood\u2019s earnings were dragged down by KRR\u2019s operations. With a potential turnaround at KRR Malaysia and the Starbucks-driven growth, Soong said this provides a two-pronged avenue to spur earnings growth. \u201cThe recent disposal of KRR Indonesia is earnings-accretive, and we believe it would continue to lift sentiments on the stock,\u201d he said. Nonetheless, BFood is currently trading at a lofty valuation. At its closing price of RM1.85 last Friday, BFood is trading at a trailing P/E of 55 times. In comparison, Starbucks Corp, listed in the US, is only trading at a trailing P/E of 26 times. The downside risks at the current price include a lower-than-expected SSSG growth and rising operating costs. \u2014 By Billy Toh \u00a0 4. Straits Inter Logistics Bhd - Bunkering services fuel growth The company seems to have gained a new lease of life. Its net profit jumped 63 times to RM631,000 in the latest third financial quarter ended Sept 30, 2017 (3QFY17) from RM10,000 in 3QFY16, while its revenue grew 63.4% to RM33 million from RM20.2 million during the same period. It has secured a RM45 million bunkering services contract which will provide more stable revenue and wider margins compared with its oil trading operation. According to Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd head of research Kenny Yee, Straits Inter Logistics is the only listed bunkering company on Bursa. Bunkering is basically a \u201cfloating petrol station\u201d for sea dwelling vessels. \u201cI think that while 3QFY17 shows a marked improvement, Straits Inter Logistics\u2019 future earnings and prospect are bright. Currently, the trading and supply of oil products has been the main revenue contributor and the company is expected to move up the value chain with the acquisition of two bunkering vessels with a combined capacity of one million litres of premium oil,\u201d Yee said. The two bunkering vessels are docked at Pasir Gudang, Johor and Labuan, according to Yee, and he pointed out the bunkering operations from the Pasir Gudang port had only commenced in 4QFY17, indicating better results in the quarter. In August last year, Straits Inter Logistics, formerly known as Raya International Bhd, unveiled a new corporate brand identity to reflect its new business direction, as a major marine logistics company providing premium oil bunkering services to marine and cargo bulk transporters, O&G vessels, floating production storage and offloading vessels, cruise ships and ferries. Under new managing director Datuk Seri Ho Kam Choy, who replaced Datuk Tan Seng Hu, and with a healthy balance sheet with net cash of RM16.5 million arising from a completed rights issue exercise, Straits Inter Logistics is in a good position to expand its bunkering business. With its share price leaping 94% in 2017, Straits Inter Logistics is trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio of 34.3 times; however, as earnings visibility improves with the start of its Pasir Gudang bunkering operations, the company\u2019s earnings are expected to catch up with the valuation. Yee has a target price of 31 sen a share for Straits Inter Logistics, indicating a potential upside of 19.2%. \u2014 By Billy Toh \u00a0 5. Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd - Record high order book Less than a year after its listing on Bursa, Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd shares more than doubled to end 2017 at RM3.24, versus its initial public offering price of RM1.50. It has a market capitalisation of RM4.33 billion. Despite the volatility in crude oil prices leaving most of Malaysia\u2019s O&G players beleaguered, the company has seen earnings rise year-on-year. Its net profit jumped nearly four times to RM229.5 million in the first nine months of 2017 due to improved contributions from its operations and maintenance as well as engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning services. Serba Dinamik, providing engineering solutions to O&G and power generation industries, is expected to benefit from a sector-wide recovery as oil prices stabilise, said PublicInvest Research deputy head of research Ching Weng Jin. Affin Hwang Capital Research has raised its target price for the stock to RM4 from RM3.60, touting Serba Dinamik\u2019s RM4 billion order book target for the latest financial year ending Dec 31, 2018 (FY18) as conservative as the company is expected to expand its asset ownership. \u201cAn all-time high order book of RM5.3 billion should drive better earnings growth in the financial year ending Dec 31, 2018,\u201d said the research house in a Dec 13 note. It is screaming \u201cbuy\u201d on the stock among analysts who track it, with consensus 12-month target price of RM3.61, according to Bloomberg data. \u2014 By Samantha Ho \u00a0 6. CIMB Group Holdings Bhd - In calmer waters An interest rate hike and improved loan growth amid stronger economic growth augur well for the banking sector in 2018. CIMB Group Holdings Bhd may benefit from healthier capital market activities going forward, according to TA Securities. Analysts opine that better growth prospects across its Indonesian and Thai operations are also likely to support earnings. \u201cWhile we forecast the overall credit charge to remain elevated, we believe the worst, in terms of asset quality, may be over,\u201d TA Securities analyst Li Hsia Wong wrote in the research firm\u2019s annual strategy report. Credit costs for CIMB improved to 73 basis points in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2017 from 78 basis points a year ago, despite a 9% quarter-on-quarter increase in absolute gross impaired loans. Also in its annual strategy report, TA Securities highlights CIMB is trading at an attractive price-book value of 1.12 times compared with an industry average of 1.15 times with its large market capitalisation at peers\u2019 average of 1.5 times. Having rallied to a one-year high of RM7.08 at end-August last year, the share price retraced to RM6.54 last Friday. It has a market value of RM60.34 billion. The group commands 18 \u201cbuy\u201d calls, four \u201cholds\u201d and two \u201csells\u201d, according to Bloomberg data. Out of 24 analysts, 21 have a consensus 12-month target price of RM6.87 a share. \u2014 By Samantha Ho \u00a0 7. Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd - Contract wins to buoy Muhibbah New contract wins and positive prospects in the construction, O&G, marine and aviation sectors are expected to continue driving earnings at Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd, which provides engineering and construction services. The group recently secured a RM70 million contract to build a reinforced concrete jetty and platform from Tenaga Nasional Bhd, as well as a RM189 million work package for the mass rail transit 2. This brings its total order book to RM2.7 billion so far. According to MIDF Research head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman, Muhibbah is among the companies expected to benefit as an exporter of services and commodities. \u201cThe group is expected to benefit from its exposure to Qatar and the tripling of its capacity there,\u201d Mohd Redza told The Edge Financial Daily, noting the blockade on Qatar by other Gulf countries is unlikely to hamper the group. Additionally, the group is expected to gain from higher aviation activity, with recurring income from its associate, Cambodia Airports, he said. All seven analysts eyeing Muhibbah, and covered by Bloomberg, maintain a \u201cbuy\u201d call on the counter, with a 12-month target price of RM3.65 a share. It last traded at RM2.84, with a market capitalisation of RM1.37 billion. \u2014 By Samantha Ho \u00a0 8. Tenaga Nasional Bhd - Analysts screaming \u201cbuy\u201d Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) saw its share price soaring further last week following the government\u2019s decision to fork out RM929 million to subsidise electricity tariff for the first six months of 2018 and also to keep the base tariff at 38.53 sen/kWh until 2020. Pending the release of regulatory period 2 (RP2) input details, most research houses have maintained their earnings forecasts and target prices for TNB. Maybank IB Research, in its latest research note dated Dec 27, said every 0.5 percentage point lower weighted average cost of capital from 2018 impacts the research house\u2019s target by RM1.30, barring any unforeseen circumstances. \u201cWe see room for Tenaga to rerate as doubts over the pass-through mechanism eventually dissipate,\u201d said Maybank IB Research. \u201cTenaga is seen as a liquid proxy to GDP (gross domestic product) growth,\u201d MIDF Research\u2019s Mohd Redza told The Edge Financial Daily on a phone call, adding the utility firm is likely to benefit from an expected economic expansion in 2018. He also pointed out the counter is among the stocks with a high trading velocity due to a strong following among local and foreign funds. Over the past one year, the stock grew about 14.41% to RM15.26 last Friday. According to Bloomberg, of the 25 analysts covering the company, 20 of them have a \u201cbuy\u201d call on the stock, four \u201cholds\u201d and one \u201csell\u201d. \u2014 By Wong Ee Lin \u00a0 9. Tasco Bhd - Clientele diversification the key driver Tasco Bhd has been strengthening its foothold in the logistics industry through diversifying its clientele and moving up the value chain by providing full-fledge logistics solutions to customers. Going into 2018, analysts are sanguine on its future growth following its venture into the cold chain market. It took over Gold Cold Transport Sdn Bhd, one of the largest cold chain logistics players in Malaysia, and MILS Cold Chain Sdn Bhd last year. MIDF Research analyst Adam Mohamed Rahim said the contribution from this segment, which started in the second quarter ended Sept 30, 2017 (2QFY18), is expected to increase moving forward. Adam added that Tasco\u2019s regional distribution centre in the Digital Free Trade Zone for Renesas, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of microcontrollers and microprocessors, is also one of the main drivers for Tasco\u2019s \u201cbright\u201d outlook in 2018. Additionally, he noted that Tasco has entered into a shareholder agreement with Yee Lee Corp Bhd\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary Yee Lee Trading Co Sdn Bhd, expected to provide expansion opportunities for Tasco, enabling the logistics player to access new markets and distribution networks. On whether it is now a good time for investors to buy the stock, Adam reckons so, explaining that Tasco is currently trading at a P/E of 14 times \u2014 reasonable compared with most of its peers with a P/E of below 10 times and 20 times. Over the past year, the stock has rallied 41.5% to close at RM2.08 in 2017. Analysts\u2019 target price is between RM2.55 and RM2.69, according to Bloomberg data. \u2014 by Wong Ee Lin \u00a0 10. MKH - Young trees to boost yield MKH Bhd, having made its foray into the oil palm plantation business 10 years ago, sees most of its oil palm trees reaching prime age in 2017 and 2018. With the expectation of better fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production to improve in the next few years, the plantation division is expected to sustain strong earnings growth and contribution to the group\u2019s bottom line. MKH\u2019s share price fell nearly 68% to RM1.63 in 2017 after its net profit for the financial year ended Sept 30, 2017 (FY17) declined 36.37% to RM130.48 million from RM205.04 million, mainly due to the absence on a net project grant worth RM11.7 million from the government and lower sales revenue. At the current level, MKH is trading at a trailing P/E of 5.8 times. In comparison, MKH trades at an average historical P/E of 9.5 times in the last five years. According to TA Securities analyst Steven Soo, MKH\u2019s share price has bottomed to a reasonable price level. Hence, he opines that the stock should recover in the second half of 2018. With expectations of the CPO price at a sustainable level above RM2,300 and the attractive valuation that MKH offers, The Edge Financial Daily has selected MKH as one of the stock picks for 2018. MKH\u2019s exposure to the property and construction segment could also see a turnaround with its launches in Kajang 2 if sales exceed expectations. MKH has deferred property launches on its prime land in Kajang and Semenyih over the past two years as it awaited the completion of key infrastructures such as the RM62 million flyover in Kajang 2, and the Sungai Buloh-Kajang mass rail transit line which has been operational since July 2017, according to AllianceDBS Research\u2019s research report dated Nov 29. The research house noted the stronger-than-expected sales from launches in Kajang 2 could be a re-rating catalyst. Nevertheless, the key risks AllianceDBS pointed out is that MKH may face margin compression due to rising construction cost for property projects as well as exposure to fluctuations in crude palm oil prices which in turn could increase earnings volatility. \u2014 by Wong Ee Lin"}, "179": {"date_posted": "2January2018", "title": "Factors that swing the market", "article": " As we usher in the New Year after the benchmark FBM KLCI closing in the positive zone in 2017\u00a0 \u2014 the first time in three years, many investors would ponder whether the strong momentum could continue into 2018. The following is the list of factors that could possibly swing the market moving forward: \u00a0 Malaysia\u2019s GE14 The much anticipated 14th general election (GE14) did not materialise in 2017, will definitely take place in 2018 before Aug 24 this year as the mandate of the ruling Barisan National (BN) coalition will end in June 2018. Analysts have in general expects the GE14 to be the main driver of investors\u2019 sentiment in early 2018 before a return to fundamentals post GE14. So far, most research analysts view that the poll is likely to be in between February and April. The pre-election rally is expected to lift sentiments and improve the \u201cfeel-good\u201d factor, which is important for incumbent governments. The election-play counters, companies that are perceived to have a political favour or have the potential to benefit from a good performance at the ballot box by the incumbents such as Utusan Melayu (M) Bhd, George Kent (M) Bhd and Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd, to name a few, would draw some interest from traders and investors. Of course, just as with everything the upcoming GE14 could also pose a downside risk to the equity market as it might act as a short-term dampener on foreign investors who are wary of political risks. Risks to the equity market also include the outcome of the election, especially since most analysts have not priced in the possibility of an unprecedented victory for the opposition. The return of Malaysia\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, to active politics, has definitely added a new variable into the equation. Should the unexpected happen, investors, both local and foreign alike, will most likely have to revisit the drawing board to evaluate the unchartered territory as BN has ruled since independence. This would lead to an immediate knee-jerk reaction to the stock market. \u00a0 Price stability in crude oil The positive outlook and price stability in crude oil are viewed as a positive driver for Malaysia\u2019s economy. The government has factored only a US$52 per barrel crude oil price in its Budget 2018\u2019s revenue assumption. Every addition of US$1 per barrel will add up to RM300 million in government\u2019s revenue and narrow the deficit by two basis points, according to TA Securities. This is positive from a sovereign credit rating perspective, which could also attract foreign investors into both the domestic equity and bond markets in Malaysia. The oil and gas companies that are listed on Bursa Malaysia will also benefit from a stronger and more stable oil price in 2018 after a disappointing performance in the last three years for most of the companies. With most of the impairments being done in previous years, some of these companies might return on investors\u2019 radar as the oil price continues to make its climb. Nonetheless, in Petronas\u2019 report on Activity Outlook 2018-2020, it highlighted three key factors that are critical for oil prices to gain strength. The first one is the compliance by Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and non-Opec countries on the output cut accord. The response from US tight oil players is also key to price recovery. It added that the ability to reduce breakeven cost from collaboration with service providers, especially deployment of innovative technology, has sustained the level of tight oil drilling activities in the US. On the demand side, Petronas highlighted that a sustained healthy global demand growth will facilitate oil stock drawdowns and subsequently hasten global oil market rebalancing. TA Securities also pointed out that Saudi Arabia\u2019s resolve to maintain high crude oil prices may weaken post potential listing of Saudi Aramco in the second half of 2018. Furthermore, a possible fix to US shale players\u2019 shortcomings in boosting supply, such as storage of hydraulic fracking crew and equipment, could limit the upside for oil prices. \u00a0 Stronger ringgit The ringgit has make its comeback in 2017 and most research houses expect the trend of a firmer ringgit against the US dollar to continue this year. The local currency is viewed to have been oversold given the prolonged losses in 2014 to 2016. The ringgit is undervalued in view of the supportive fundamentals, a more stable oil price, external reserves rebuilding, sustained trade and current account surpluses, progress in fiscal consolidation, receding foreign holding risk in the bond market as well as resumption in the repatriation of export earnings. Affin Hwang Investment Bank Bhd said in its Malaysia Strategy 2018 Outlook report that typical beneficiaries from a stronger ringgit from an operational perspective includes airlines, auto and media companies on lower operating costs. As for the balance sheet, those with a higher proportion of US dollar-denominated borrowings are also likely to see improvement. The stronger ringgit would have a negative impact on exporters, such as rubber glove players and semiconductor companies but Affin Hwang noted that the negative currency impact on some of these players would be mitigated by the growth drivers in these sectors. \u00a0 Monetary tightening and unwinding of QE The US has started the ball rolling with its rate hike and unwinding of its quantitative easing (QE). In October last year, the US Federal Reserve started to unwind its balance sheet, starting at US$10 billion every month and this will rise by US$10 billion each quarter onwards to a maximum of US$50 billion per month. The market is expecting another three rounds of rate hikes in 2018. The latest US tax cuts in 2018 that have just recently been passed will also lead to a stronger US dollar and greater inflation. Inflation could rise faster than expected when the higher disposable income from the US$1.4 trillion tax savings over the next decade filters through the economy. The faster-than-expected tightening in the developed markets could also induce volatility in financial markets due to rapid capital outflows from emerging markets such as Malaysia. In Malaysia, it is also likely that the central bank will follow suit as expectations of a hike in the overnight policy rate (OPR) has increased on the back of a strong gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first three quarters of 2017. The prospect of Bank Negara Malaysia raising the OPR will provide a near-term catalyst for the banking sector as banks benefit from an interest rate upcycle as loans are repriced quicker than deposits. Of course, the Malaysian banking sector could see some impact from the implementation of MFRS9 but research houses, such as Affin Hwang, do not foresee any material impact on earnings as asset quality remains healthy. \u00a0 Corporate earnings expected to grow Corporate earnings among Bursa-listed companies had been disappointing considering the strong GDP growth in 2017. Moving forward, as global economy continues to show synchronised expansion, investors will need to see improvement in earnings to be convinced. According to Maybank Investment Bank (IB) Research\u2019s report on 2018 Outlook & Lookouts, which was published in mid-December last year, global growth momentum is set to be maintained in 2018, expanding at 3.6%, the same pace as in 2017. Maybank IB Research expects a 5.3% growth in 2018, with domestic demand to continue as growth driver on the back of continued growth in consumer spending, public consumption and gross fixed capital formation on expansions in both private investment and public investment. Maybank IB Research has a core earnings growth estimate of 7.9% for 2017 and forecast of 9.7% for 2018 as compared to the \u201cno growth\u201d years between 2014 and 2016. Similarly, TA Securities expects earnings growth under its coverage to increase by 6.1% and 7.5% in 2018 and 2019 respectively. \u00a0 External risks remain Being an open economy, Malaysia is highly exposed to external risks, such as trade protectionism and economic nasionalism, seen in the US under President Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly spoke of his intent to rectify persistent trade imbalances and trade barriers with other countries \u2014 with China being on top of that list \u2014 any trade war or implication of one among the two largest economies in the world will affect the world, including Malaysia. The uncertainty revolving Brexit as well as rising geopolitical tension between some of the countries could also impact investors\u2019 sentiment. Among the main concerns involving geopolitical tensions are the ongoing feud between the US and North Korea, Arab Saudi and Iran. A potential war would put synchronised global economy expansion at a halt."}}
