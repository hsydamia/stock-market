Bloomberg data showed that there were more corporates that slipped into the red than those that turned profitable. It is easy to see why some heads of research and market observers were disappointed as more than 50% of the 2Q earnings that were announced from mid-July to end-August underperformed compared with a year ago. \\u201cIt was bad. Just at a glance, I think I can say that about two-thirds of the results have been a disappointment,\\u201d Pong Teng Siew, the head of research of Inter-Pacific Research Sdn Bhd, told The Edge Financial Daily. Pong explained that the disappointment in earnings was partly a result of uncertainty arising from the 14th general election (GE14) in May. \\u201cPrior to the election in May, corporates had been more cautious in terms of their capital expenditure as they wanted to wait for more clarity. The same was seen in consumer spending, especially on some of the big-ticket items,\\u201d he said. Pong added that the historical change in government had also triggered some uncertainties, especially for the construction segment, as seen by the deferral and potential cancellation of some of the mega infrastructure projects. \\u201cThen, there was also the zero-rated GST [goods and services tax], which took place in June. Most consumers waited until after it [zero-rated GST] kicked in before they made their purchase,\\u201d he said, noting that there could be a spike in June\\u2019s purchase, but it was only one out of three months of 2Q. Bloomberg data showed that 78 companies reporting their numbers for the quarter ended June slipped into the red for the period under review. This worked out to 12% of corporates that released their financials during this period. Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of research Vincent Lau agreed that some of the earnings had not been impressive. \\u201cThe results have been a mixed bag so far. We do see some lacklustre performances here and there \\u2026 I do not think there is a specific sector that has been a let-down,\\u201d Lau said. Axiata Group Bhd, Bumi Armada Bhd and YTL Corp Bhd were among those that had recorded a net loss during the quarter, compared to a net profit for the prior year\\u2019s corresponding quarter. Axiata was dragged into the red by a one-off non-cash impairment of RM3.38 billion as a result of derecognition and reclassification of Idea Cellular Ltd from being an associate to a simple investment. Even without taking into consideration the impairment, Axiata\\u2019s normalised profit after tax and minority interest for the second financial quarter ended June 30, 2018 (2QFY18) was 38.2% lower at RM263.7 million on the back of higher depreciation and amortisation charges due to aggressive investment in data over the last two years, higher tax benefits in FY17 and higher investment in digital businesses. Bumi Armada also saw a net loss of RM585.48 million for 2QFY18, compared to a net profit of RM116.59 million a year ago, on lower revenue as well as an impairment charge of RM478.94 million. The disappointing results led to a huge selldown in its stock as its share price fell by 21.64% or 14.5 sen to 52.5 sen. There was some recovery last Thursday as Bumi Armada closed 5.71% or three sen higher at 55.5 sen. The impairment charges of RM477.2 million and RM1.7 million were for the Armada Kraken FPSO (floating production storage and offloading unit) and Armada Gema respectively. Bumi Armada noted that despite the higher oil prices seen at the beginning of the year, oil companies had continued to remain cautious about committing new capital to new projects. YTL Corp also fell into the red for its 4QFY18 ended June 30, 2018, with a net loss of RM43.36 million compared to a net profit of RM229.33 million for 4QFY17, due to higher losses from the management services and others division. Its share price fell to RM1.28 last Thursday, its lowest since July 13, before a rebound in the last minute of trading to close at RM1.33. \\u00a0 Better 3Q expected but caution advised On the sentiment moving forward, Pong said the market had remained cautious as uncertainties on the external front could affect companies that had delivered good earnings so far. For 2Q, most of the counters that have delivered include the tech-related sector, semiconductors and exporters. However, given the uncertainties over US-China trade relations, companies\\u2019 future earnings could be affected. He also warned of the expensive valuation pegged to some of the counters that had reported positive earnings growth. Nevertheless, Pong believes 3Q earnings should see a slight recovery as July and August would have benefited from the zero-rated GST, but the reintroduction of the sales and services tax could have a slight impact on bottom lines. Lau from Rakuten Trade also foresees an improvement for 3Q. \\u201cThe third quarter will be better in terms of earnings. The consumer sentiment index soared to a 21-year high at 132.9 in 2Q this year; breaching the 100-point optimism threshold is good news for the consumer sector and businesses in general. The feel-good factor of the zero-rated GST from June until the end of August would also be beneficial to companies earnings,\\u201d he said. While Lau remains cautious about his expectations for the second half of this year, he is optimistic that the worst is over, with some of the short-term pain likely to be removed, especially when there is more clarity from the new government moving forward in the upcoming budget. Another fund manager of a local asset management firm, speaking on condition of anonymity, agreed with both Pong and Lau in terms of the lacklustre financial performance for 2Q, highlighting that some expectations had run ahead of the companies\\u2019 fundamentals. \\u201cI think what we have seen so far is expectations running ahead of the earnings recovery. Just look at Bumi Armada and Velesto Energy Bhd. Both companies were back in the red, although for Velesto, the losses were narrowed. These impairments that were largely unexpected were one of the reasons for the disappointment,\\u201d he said. He added that corporates with a leaner and stronger balance sheet could have an upper hand moving forward. \\u201cO&G [oil and gas] players like Velesto Energy, which has reduced its debt level, could stand a better chance for a more sustainable recovery. Velesto Energy saw its net debt-to-equity [ratio] reduced to 0.38 times [as of June 30, 2018], compared with 1.55 times a year ago,\\u201d he said. Nonetheless, despite some of the disappointments seen this earnings season, the KLCI saw a strong recovery from the post-GE14 selldown, closing at 1,819.66 points last Thursday. It is in fact one of the best performing benchmark equity indices in the region so far this year. The fund manager added that the rally seen in the KLCI was supported by local institutions, such as the Employees Provident Fund. \\u201cIf you just look at the index, I do not think it is a clear reflection of how the market is at the moment. The broader market has been in the red, and it is easy to see why with quite a bit of uncertainty over the country\\u2019s direction moving forward,\\u201d he said, noting the underperformance seen for plantation, construction and even property players. He added that the better earnings seen for financial institutions had been another catalyst for the KLCI."}, "8": {"date_posted": "28/8/2018", "title": "SE Asian stocks rise on US-Mexico trade optimism; M'sia hits over 3-mth closing high", "article": " BENGALURU (Aug 28): Southeast Asian stock markets rose on Tuesday in tandem with Asian peers as global trade worries briefly ebbed following a deal by the United States and Mexico to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

With the winds of change continuing to blow, creating uncertainty in the market over the past three months, the FBM KLCI has declined 2%. It closed at 1,805.75 points last Friday. The benchmark index has underperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), which has risen 4.7%, as well as the Bursa Malaysia Small Cap Index, which has gained 3.7%. Post-election, some fund managers have repeatedly urged investors not to just look at the constituent stocks of the FBM KLCI, mostly large caps and government-linked companies (GLCs). Instead, they prefer the so-called non-GLCs and those with minimal political connections following the general election on May 9. One reason is that under the previous administration, economic growth was largely driven by the public sector and the GLCs, which were seen to be crowding out real private investment as they were believed to have preferential access to government contracts and to benefit from favourable regulations. However, with the new government\\u2019s rebalancing Malaysia\\u2019s fiscal position, investors have been warned of a significant pullback by GLCs as key growth drivers. A GLC is defined as a commercially-driven company under the control of a government-linked investment company (GLICs). There are seven GLICs at the federal level, including Minister of Finance Inc, Employees Provident Fund (EPF), Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) and Lembaga Tabung Haji (LTH). While it is not right to take a blanket view and say all GLCs will underperform non-GLCs in the coming years, it is important to note that certain GLCs are currently trading at high valuations, which may not be sustainable. For instance, integrated healthcare service provider IHH Healthcare Bhd \\u2014 a unit of sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd \\u2014 is trading at a trailing 12-month price-earnings ratio (TTM PER) of 94 times, compared to its two-year PER average of 66 times. Regional telecommunications conglomerate Axiata Group Bhd, in which Khazanah is the single largest shareholder, is trading at a historical PER of 76 times, compared to its two-year PER average of 71 times. Sime Darby Bhd, a diversified giant controlled by PNB, saw its TTM PER almost double to 40 times while Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd\\u2019s was 29 times (see table). By comparison, Apple Inc, which recently became the first US company to achieve a market capitalisation of over US$1 trillion, is only trading at a PER of 19 times. The Dow, FBM KLCI and Bursa Malaysia Small Cap Index are trading at PERs of between 18 and 19 times. Geoffrey Ng, investment adviser and director at Fortress Capital Asset Management (M) Sdn Bhd, says the change of government had an immediate impact on the corporate world, especially the GLCs. \\u201cThis is a structural change that needs to happen. The crowding-out effect brought about by the government has been going on close to two decades, which has seen consolidation in favour of the GLCs. For the private sector to come back in a big way, to be competitive and a major part of the economy again, will take just as long,\\u201d he tells The Edge. While Ng does not say that investors should avoid GLCs, he reiterates that growth going forward will be driven by the private sector. \\u201cIt really depends on what message individual GLCs send to the market. Some GLCs will be restructuring by getting rid of non-core assets.\\u201d If these GLCs are taking a strategic look at their assets and restructuring from there, investors might be able to find some interesting opportunities, he adds. \\u201cIf they are unlocking their value, we want to be part of that. We want to participate in their exercises.\\u201d Areca Capital CEO Danny Wong Teck Meng concurs. \\u201cI think growth is still there for big caps (GLCs), but that of the private sector\\u2019s should be higher. Some GLCs will be affected by the changes in government policies.\\u201d Wong believes the local equity market will be driven by the private sector in the next two to three years, and small and mid caps are expected to do better than big caps in a growing economy. \\u201cForeign investors like this kind of political reform or economic reform theme,\\u201d he says on the change of government. As local sentiments improve, people are willing to spend and companies are willing to expand, he adds. Pheim \\u00a0Management Sdn Bhd executive chairman Dr Tan Chong Koay lauds some of the initiatives taken by the government to reduce wastage and expenses. \\u201cSo far, most are quite comfortable with what the government has done,\\u201d he says. He believes growth in the coming years could come from technological innovation in e-commerce, transport and 5G connectivity, among others. \\u201cThus, for semiconductors, even though it might slow down a bit, I think there is still growth potential for players in that sector. \\u201cCrisis is an opportunity ... it is how you read it. There was an opportunity then (when the stock market fell after GE14),\\u201d Tan says, pointing to the recovery in some stocks that saw a significant selldown after the election. Going back to the GLCs, can institutional funds afford to ignore them, given that some may have an investment mandate to invest in large caps? Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of research Vincent Lau says that generally, fund managers have to invest in bigger companies with liquidity. \\u201cMany of the GLCs are KLCI component stocks, hence fund managers need the weighting of such shareholdings.\\u201d Lau believes the GLCs will still be attractive even if the private sector takes on a bigger role. \\u201cGLCs are the bellwether of our economy and are entrenched in major sectors. We believe there will be pockets of opportunity for investors to buy into the GLCs as they undergo transformation and management change, with better returns going forward,\\u201d he says. Fortress Capital\\u2019s Ng says that over the years, the mandate of fund managers has been to expand their portfolios, but not necessarily just by investing in large caps. \\u201cOf course, if you run exchange-traded funds or have a passive mandate, then probably you will be heavily tilted towards blue chips. But as far as we are concerned, we are quite okay. In terms of investment value, GLCs constitute less than 15% of our Malaysia portfolio.\\u201d Areca Capital\\u2019s Wong says GLCs make up less than 5% of its portfolio and he does not intend to increase exposure to them in the near future, considering there are small and mid cap companies that could provide better upside. \\u201cThere are certain mandates for some fund managers. I don\\u2019t like this... I want flexibility. We should not restrict the fund managers\\u2019 choices. Don\\u2019t get me wrong ... we are not avoiding GLCs, but we are not focusing on investing in them.\\u201d\\u00a0"}, "16": {"date_posted": "19/8/2018", "title": "E-commerce: Southeast Asia: the new e-battleground", "article": " Southeast Asia is slowly becoming the new battlefield for e-commerce platforms as more of them establish a presence in the region. Right now, the two largest platforms are Lazada, which is controlled by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, and 11street, which is operated by Celcom Planet Sdn Bhd \\u2014 a joint venture between the subsidiaries of Axiata Group Bhd and South Korea-based SK Telecom. Shopee, which focuses on the mobile rather than online platform, entered the fray a few years ago. It is operated by Sea Group (previously known as Garena Interactive Holding Ltd), which was founded in Singapore in 2009 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange last year. \\u201cSoutheast Asia has become the new battlefield for e-commerce platforms and the competition will only heighten,\\u201d says Yong Kai Ping, chief executive of the Selangor Information Technology & E-commerce Council (Sitec). Taiwan\\u2019s largest business-to-consumer (B2C) online retailer \\u2014 PChome Online Group \\u2014 is also making its way to this part of the world, says Goh Boon Peng, CEO of Mystartr, a rewards-based crowdfunding platform. This was announced by PChome chairman Jan Hung-Tze last month. Now, there is talk that JD.com \\u2014 one of China\\u2019s largest online retailers (and a key competitor of the T-mall run by Alibaba) \\u2014 is heading to this region as well, says Yong. It remains to be seen if global e-commerce juggernaut Amazon will follow suit. There have been some signs that it is already extending its feelers to this part of the world. Last December, the company launched the Amazon Prime Now mobile app in Singapore. \\u201cWe believe that Amazon is looking very carefully at the situation in various markets. We would be surprised if it passed up the opportunity in Southeast Asia \\u2014 it is just too attractive,\\u201d says Julian Atrope, senior vice-president of business development at iPrice Group. He says the opportunity lies in the region\\u2019s growing internet economy, which is expected to exceed US$200 billion by 2025, according to the Google-Temasek e-Conomy SEA report published in 2016. With all these companies pouring cash and other resources into Southeast Asia, e-commerce growth is expected to pick up, says Yong. \\u00a0 The Greater Southeast Asia market To understand why this is happening, it is essential to understand what the Greater Southeast Asia (GSEA) region is all about and how Taiwan\\u2019s subsidy war factors into it. The GSEA includes Taiwan and the southern part of China, such as Guangzhou, while the subsidy war is between PChome and Shopee. The subsidy war started in 2016, when Garena, which had gaming as its core business, launched Shopee and identified Taiwan as its first market. PChome was the market leader in Taiwan, in the B2B and B2C markets, and Shopee was effectively encroaching on its turf. Shopee chose to launch its first offensive in Taiwan because it was a mature market and ripe for the picking. With the right strategy, it would be able to gain market share and generate revenue fairly quickly. According to Export.gov, a website run by the US Department of Commerce and other government agencies, Taiwan has one of the highest e-commerce penetration rates globally, with a market size of US$37.6 billion in 2016. The market also experienced an average growth rate of 10% to 20% from 2012 to 2016. Second, Taiwan is a small country with a concentrated population. This ensures that the money the Singapore-based company spends there will have a more significant impact than if it spent it in, say, Malaysia or Indonesia. Also, there was a clear target \\u2014 market leader PChome. Goh says when Shopee researched the e-commerce market in Taiwan, it found a weakness it could exploit to open up the market and grab market share from the incumbent. The weakness was this: Taiwanese consumers were willing to buy products from an online platform if they did not have to pay the cost of transport. \\u201cAnd when you get more consumers buying products on the platform, more merchants are willing to sell their products on it,\\u201d he adds. The strategy proved successful. But PChome, which was alive to the threat to its dominance, went on the counteroffensive by providing subsidies to merchants and shoppers. The results were clear \\u2014 its revenue increased 14.27% last year. But this was at the cost of virtually wiping out its profit, which fell a whopping 95%. Online reports say the behemoth spent no less than NT$10 billion (RM132 million) defending its position in 2016. Sea Group did not do too well either. It saw losses in the past three years. According to its annual report, it lost US$107.3 million, US$225 million and US$561.2 million in 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively. If people only looked at the numbers, they would conclude that the whole thing was a lose-lose situation, says Goh. So, how does this tie in with the GSEA concept? Basically, it was the recognition of this market that allowed Sea Group to raise billions in funding to \\u201cattack\\u201d the Taiwan market. And PChome is retaliating by expanding into Southeast Asia, says Yong. \\u201cJan intended to list PChome\\u2019s subsidiary, Ruten (which is jointly owned with eBay), on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, but he cancelled the listing plans in June. His new plan is to raise funds for Ruten in the private market and use it to fight Shopee,\\u201d says Goh. \\u201cThen, Jan will aim for the GSEA market, just like Shopee. If he remains in Taiwan, he will only be defending his turf and risk missing out on the big opportunity in Southeast Asia. But if he expands, he could attack Shopee in other markets and put it on the defensive. After all, PChome already has an operation in Thailand, but it is not that big.\\u201d As for the Chinese players, Southeast Asia has always been their next expansion target, says Yong. \\u201cThere is the Chinese diaspora in the region that they can leverage. It is harder for them to expand into India or the Middle East. And if they go west, they come up against powerful companies such as Amazon.\\u201d \\u00a0 A \\u2018subsidy war\\u2019 in Malaysia? A subsidy war has already broken out in Southeast Asia, but in a different form and less visible, says Goh. He adds that Lazada had raised about US$700 million since 2011, but had become cash-strapped. Last year, Alibaba injected another US$1 billion into the company and increased its stake from 51% to 83%. While it is hard to tell how much of the US$700 million was spent in Malaysia, it would not have been a small amount, says Goh. Recently, 11street Malaysia welcomed a new investor \\u2014 locally listed media and advertising firm PUC Bhd \\u2014 which had agreed to invest up to RM90 million in the e-commerce platform. Before this, 11street burnt about US$30 million a year in Malaysia, says Yong. Goh says, \\u201cWhile there are no exact figures to show how much these companies spent in Malaysia, it is a huge amount. It would not be less than what we saw in Taiwan recently.\\u201d He adds that there is no doubt the money is being spent on subsidising the logistics and listing fees of the online merchants. A large chunk of the money is also being used to subsidise consumers through promotions and discounts. However, the \\u201csubsidy war\\u201d in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, is not as apparent because the competition between e-commerce platforms is not as intense as in Taiwan, says Goh. E-commerce is still at a nascent stage in Malaysia, he adds. \\u201cIndustry players in Taiwan are discussing what percentage of daily household items are bought online. But in Malaysia, the discussion is still very basic such as how many people shop online.\\u201d Nevertheless, Malaysia\\u2019s e-commerce industry is set to grow by leaps and bounds in the coming years. \\u201cThat is why investors keep throwing money at the industry. They see the potential and the trend is irreversible,\\u201d says Goh. The National eCommerce Strategic Roadmap \\u2014 produced by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation and US consulting firm A.T. Kearney \\u2014 points out that the Malaysian e-commerce market grew from RM49 billion to RM68 billion from 2012 to 2015 at a compound annual growth rate of about 12%. It predicts that the market will grow at a CAGR of 11% from 2015 to 2020, effectively doubling to RM114 billion. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 Will SMEs gain or lose? For Selangor Information Technology & E-commerce Council (Sitec) chief executive Yong Kai Ping and Mystartr CEO Goh Boon Peng, the next few years could be a \\u201cgolden era\\u201d for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that seize the opportunity to learn how to sell their products online. As the internet is borderless, the online platforms will be able to open up more opportunities for these businesses to go regional or global. Meanwhile, with more e-commerce platforms moving into Malaysia, the SMEs that are also online merchants could benefit by getting all sorts of subsidies and support when the competition between these platforms heats up. For now, these platforms are already providing merchants with support such as free online marketing classes and photographers to take photos of their products. There could be more to come, says Goh. Yong says some SMEs can find their niche in the online space, primarily those whose products are already popular in the massive China market. \\u201cBusiness opportunities such as these are obvious. That is why brands such as OldTown White Coffee could be taken over by the likes of Jacobs Douwe Egberts in the future. You also see CVC Capital Partners eyeing snack food maker Munchy Group. Their products are selling well in China.\\u201d Besides food manufacturers, some furniture makers are also doing well in China, he adds. For instance, many SMEs in Johor, particularly in Muar, have made a name for themselves there. Other niche products include halal products and services. \\u00a0 Fear of losing out, especially to China However, the SMEs\\u2019 fear of losing out to regional competitors is also very real, says Yong. They are particularly afraid of competition from China as the country can produce cheaper products with its economies of scale and technological advantage. \\u201cThe fear has always been there and these are valid concerns,\\u201d he adds. On the home front, Yong says the SMEs are afraid of outside competition as they do not have enough support from the government to compete on the regional and global stage. An example is the recent announcement of the launch of the Digital Free Trade Zone \\u2014 a strategic collaboration between Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The government has not specified how it will help local business to benefit from the initiative. \\u201cIt seems that the initiative is good for the country\\u2019s economy, but the government has not provided details of how it will help local SMEs seize the opportunity to export their products overseas. There has been no announcement on what kind of support it will provide to SMEs to help them compete in the online world on a global stage. It is no wonder that the SMEs are afraid of losing out,\\u201d says Yong. The government has come out with the SME Masterplan, but the impact is not widely felt, he adds. There are also incentives to help SMEs purchase equipment to upgrade their businesses. But more often than not, they do not have the money to make those purchases in the first place. \\u201cThe government has to put in more effort to come out with solid measures that support our SMEs so they can compete in the online world,\\u201d says Yong. Some SMEs are also worried that two of the three major e-commerce platforms in Malaysia are primarily controlled by Chinese companies. For instance, Alibaba has an 83% stake in Lazada, the largest e-commerce platform locally and one of the biggest players in Southeast Asia. Shopee, a mobile-based e-commerce marketplace, is run by Singapore-based Sea Group, which is 40%-owned by Tencent Holdings Ltd, one of the largest tech companies in China. China\\u2019s influence is pervasive throughout the region. For instance, Alibaba has invested US$1.1 billion in Indonesia-based e-commerce firm Tokopedia while JD.com, Tencent and Thai retailer Central Group announced in December last year that they would form a US$500 million e-commerce and financial technology (fintech) joint venture. However, this should be less of a concern as the platforms should remain unbiased to businesses in these countries, says Yong. \\u201cThey earn their money from transactions. The more, the merrier, regardless of where the merchants are from. Sentiment aside, this should not be a major concern.\\u201d Michael Kang, national president of the SME Association of Malaysia, says the fear of Chinese businesses invading the local market has been overstated. \\u201cMany people do not know that many Chinese companies that expanded overseas have failed.\\u201d One of the reasons is that the Malaysian market is tiny compared with China. Businesses from China cannot just throw money in Malaysia and expect to get a return the way they can back home. \\u201cThis strategy may work in China, but not in other countries,\\u201d says Kang. There are other barriers as well. \\u201cLet\\u2019s say Chinese companies like to do business using cash and transactions are done very quickly via digital wallets. But in Malaysia, you cannot do cash transactions. You need to give credit terms. And the transactions are done more slowly. It is not easy for them to penetrate our market,\\u201d he says. \\u00a0 What more can be done? Yong says there are a few things that can be done to buy local SMEs some time to upgrade their products. For starters, the government could impose a tariff on specific imported products to protect local businesses in the shorter term. Short-term protectionism would allow them to innovate and upgrade their products before the market is fully opened up. The government could set up more agencies such as Sitec to educate SMEs on how to market and sell their products online by utilising the various e-commerce platforms. \\u201cThe government should have more focus on the grassroots economy, which is to help SMEs,\\u201d says Yong. By seeing the potential of e-commerce, more players can join the industry to provide SMEs with different services at reasonable prices. The role that Sitec is playing could also be done by private entities so that e-commerce awareness and knowledge can be disseminated even faster. For now, there are still very few private players, says Yong. And most of do not have the proper knowledge. He shares a story about a friend who conducted a social media marketing class for SMEs to help them sell products online. \\u201cThe person\\u2019s Facebook account, together with the accounts of other SME businesses that attended his class, was blocked by Facebook the following day as it violated some of the platform\\u2019s rules.\\u201d In other cases, the knowledge shared in such classes are proper and useful, but the fee at RM3,000 to RM4,000 is deemed too high, says Yong."}, "17": {"date_posted": "8/8/2018", "title": "FBM KLCI up 13.64 points on foreign buying; ABM Fujiya nears limit up", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 8): The FBM KLCI rose 13.64 points or 0.76% on what appeared to be foreign investor demand for Malaysian stocks.

The good news is that this non-cash write-down is likely largely priced in with Axiata shares down over 21% year to date to close at RM4.33 last Friday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM39.3 billion. A RM3 billion write-down could shave 30 sen to 40 sen off Axiata\\u2019s valuation, depending on how much value one ascribes to the 8.17% stake that Axiata still has in the enlarged Vodafone Idea, which last Friday officially unseated the previous India No 1 player Bharti Airtel Ltd. Both Indian players continue to face intense competition from strong newcomer Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which is backed by India\\u2019s richest billionaire Mukesh Ambani, who wants a 50% share of India\\u2019s telecom revenue by 2020. Nonetheless, the non-cash write-down will not affect Axiata\\u2019s ability to pay dividends, even if there is a headline loss. \\u201cWe do acknowledge that a reclassification requires us to register a one-off, non-cash adjustment. However, it neither has any impact on our normalised earnings for the full year nor on our cash position today or in the future. Likewise, this does not reflect the future value of the merged entity, especially given the potential benefits to be derived from the synergies of the two large companies and the consolidation of the industry. Effectively, this exercise is not reflective of Idea or Axiata\\u2019s intrinsic value,\\u201d Axiata president and group CEO Tan Sri Jamaludin Ibrahim said in a July 27 statement.  In fact, at the current share price level, some analysts are telling clients there is a bigger real earnings pool as Axiata no longer needs to equity account losses from Idea, which will no longer be an associate company post its merger with Vodafone India. \\u201cThis [non-equity accounting] should be positive [for Axiata] in the medium term given the ... continued losses that the combined entity is likely to incur against the background of India\\u2019s highly competitive environment, driven by Reliance Jio,\\u201d AmInvestment Bank Research analyst Alex Goh writes in a July 26 note. For the record, Axiata\\u2019s 19.74% stake in Idea was diluted to 18.1% and thereafter 16.3% in February (RM357.6 million loss) when Axiata did not participate in Idea\\u2019s placement exercise. Axiata\\u2019s stake will be further diluted to 8.17% on completion of Idea\\u2019s merger with Vodafone India. \\u201cThe merger is now subject to the National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai Branch, passing the dissolution order of Vodafone Mobile Services Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd, which is expected shortly,\\u201d read Idea Cellular\\u2019s July 27 statement to India\\u2019s stock exchange, which announced the approval by India\\u2019s Department of Telecommunications. Axiata is expected to report second-quarter earnings on Aug 23 and the size of the technical impairment will be determined based on Idea\\u2019s share price at the point of reclassification on the final completion of the Vodafone-Idea merger, which is expected in August. Still, there are those who think Axiata \\u2014 which invested over RM5 billion in Idea \\u2014 would eventually raise additional cash by selling its Vodafone Idea stake and use part of that money to increase dividends to shareholders, including government-owned Khazanah Nasional Bhd, which is Axiata\\u2019s largest shareholder with a 37.3% direct and deemed stake as at June 14. Billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla, of the Aditya-Birla group, which has 26% stake in the enlarged Vodafone Idea, has the right to level holdings with Vodafone, which will have about 45%. If Birla buys Axiata\\u2019s stake in Idea, it will need to buy fewer shares from Vodafone to have a larger say. Axiata, expectedly, says it is in no hurry to sell. \\u201cNow, as a pure financial investor in the largest player in the Indian market, [Axiata] is better positioned to review and assess the value of this investment. At this point, we have a very strong cash position and, therefore, have no immediate plans to divest or exit, as long as there is no better alternative use of funds that would provide better returns to our shareholders. We will obviously review our position from time to time,\\u201d Jamaludin says, adding that Axiata is confident of \\u201csignificant upside in valuation as synergies are realised\\u201d. To be sure, Axiata is not the first to suffer losses in India. At least RM23 billion has been written off or lost by seven foreign telecom firms in India, Axiata points out in a July 27 statement. British mobile phone operator Vodafone last year recorded more than \\u20ac3 billion impairment on its Indian unit. Three of the nine international players that invested in India in 2012 have exited (Etisalat in 2012, Bahrain Telecom in 2012 and DoCoMo in 2014). Two others have merged with larger players, including Telenor ASA\\u2019s Uninor with Singapore Telecommunications Ltd\\u2019s Bharti, while Aircel has filed for bankruptcy. Axiata, which first entered Idea in 2008, benefited from close to RM1 billion in operational profit from Idea as the latter grew from the fifth largest player to the third largest mobile operator in India. From 2008 to 2015, Idea\\u2019s profit after tax (PAT) saw a 19.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) to US$473 million in 2015 from US$136 million in 2008 on the back of 21% CAGR in revenue to US$5.1 billion in 2015 from US$1.35 billion in 2008. In 2016, however, Idea made only US$56 million PAT on US$5.42 billion in revenue. Last year, Idea booked US$519 million losses on revenue of US$4.45 billion. The September 2016 entry of Jio into the India telecom market changed the equation for the incumbents. The availability of spectrum, a clean slate and a deep-pocketed billionaire backer allowed Jio to throw US$35 billion to US$40 billion \\u2014 more money than the industry\\u2019s combined investment the past two decades \\u2014 into new technology and 4G network rollouts to win over 15% subscriber market share and an even larger revenue share within a short period. Jio caused Bharti to report its first loss in 15 years and Indian operations continued to be in the red when the latest quarterly results were announced last week. Vodafone Idea will serve a customer base of 440 million, representing 39% of the total market while its revenue market share is estimated at 37.5%. Bharti has about 344 million customers. \\u00a0 Taking a cue from the EPF? It could take some time before Axiata sees greater value from its Indian investment. Yet, at least one of Axiata\\u2019s major shareholders took advantage of the share price weakness when Axiata shares slipped to their lowest in 6\\u00bd years at RM3.80 apiece on June 29. Stock exchange filings show that the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) had a 16.947% stake or 1.53 billion shares in Axiata as at July 11, up 18.4 million shares in one month from 16.743% or 1.515 billion shares as at June 12. Of the 24 price targets available on Bloomberg at the time of writing, only Goldman Sachs\\u2019 RM3.90 target price is below last Friday\\u2019s RM4.33 close. The largest group of analysts are the 11 who value Axiata shares at RM5 to RM5.50 apiece, implying at least 15% upside potential. Five analysts think Axiata shares are worth RM4.50 to RM4.95 apiece, three others value the shares at RM5.55 to RM5.99 while the four most bullish ones think Axiata should be worth at least RM6 apiece \\u2014 AmInvestment Bank and TA Securities (RM6.20), Macquarie (RM6.33) and Nomura (RM6.40). Apart from its stake in Vodafone Idea, Axiata also owns 100% of Celcom, 66.4% of XL in Indonesia, 83.3% of Dialog in Sri Lanka, 68.7% of Robi in Bangladesh, 82.5% of Smart in Cambodia, 80% of Ncell in Nepal, 28.7% of M1 in Singapore, 100% of Axiata Digital Sdn Bhd and 63% of tower company edotco Group Sdn Bhd, which may go for an initial public offering next year. \\u00a0"}, "21": {"date_posted": "3/8/2018", "title": "Gamuda, KPS, Bumi Armada, SLP Resources, Frontken, Axiata, Anzo, Lay Hong, AHP, Parlo, Nylex, Ancom, YTL Power, UEM Sunrise and T7 Global", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 3): Based on corporate announcements and news flow today, stocks in focus on Monday (Aug 6) may include: Gamuda Bhd, Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor Bhd, Bumi Armada Bhd, SLP Resources Bhd, Frontken Corp Bhd, Axiata Bhd, Anzo Holdings Bhd, Lay Hong Bhd, Amanah Harta Tanah PNB, Parlo Bhd, Nylex (Malaysia) Bhd, Ancom Bhd, YTL Power International Bhd, UEM Sunrise Bhd and T7 Global Bhd.

SLP Resources Bhd\\u2019s net profit for the second quarter ended June 30, 2018 (2QFY18) quadrupled to RM10.51 million from RM2.56 million a year ago, mainly due to higher export sales of flexible plastic packaging within the region, and better profit margin.

So far, we do not see any big fluctuation in stock prices related to companies in which Khazanah has invested in, which include CIMB Bank Bhd and Axiata Group Bhd,\" he told Bernama. Nazri Khan said reports that Khazanah, Permodalan Nasional Bhd and Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u00a0would likely come under the ambit of the Prime Minister's Office instead of the newly formed Ministry of Economic Affairs would not hamper investors' confidence in Malaysia. \"It is just a restructuring move and a baby step to improve the governance and feasibility of the three companies under the New Economic Model. \"Furthermore, it is also one of the ways to phase out political appointees in the government-linked companies (GLCs) as expounded by Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad,\" he said. Commenting on Inter-Pacific Securities Sdn Bhd\\u2019s statistics that foreign net outflow on Bursa Malaysia amounted to RM437.1 million from Monday to Thursday compared with foreign net selling of RM247.1 million a week earlier, Nazri Khan said it was mainly due to losses in oil and gas-related stocks affected largely by tensions between Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, Assistant Professor of Management at Asia School of Business Dr Renato Lima de Oliveira said a series of resignations and changes in the GLCs would give greater leeway to the new government to pursue their policy priorities and manifesto.\\u00a0 \"There is a lot of goodwill with the current government, with Malaysia\\u2019s historical alternation of power, and Pakatan Harapan (PH) will have the ability to put together their governing team. Many can see these changes as part of a unique historical moment. \"However, it is important to stress that one of the key points of PH ascension to power was to strengthen the country\\u2019s institutions. \\u201cIt is important in the long run to strengthen the governance of GLCs and protect them from political changes and pressures,\" said Oliveira who is also a a fellow at the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs. On the other hand, if the government were to shift the vision of how the GLCs should function, which is a complex issue, he said it needed to draft a vision and engage the society via public hearings, forums or parliamentary debate. From the feedback gathered, it must hire the right people to tackle the tasks at hand, he added. \"Ideally, recruit (the right people) through a system such as an independent search committee that ensure positions are filled by merit. If you are not changing the vision but just changing teams, it would be easier to replace,\" he said. De Oliveira said as Malaysia was getting closer towards having competitive elections involving changing coalition in the government, it would not helpful to have key state positions changing hands every time there was a change of government. He noted that the GLCs should be protected from political changes and pressures to enable them to become more focused in executing the policy priorities of the government in power. On Friday, Dr Mahathir said the resignation of Khazanah group managing director Tan Sri Azman Mokhtar and the rest of the board members would enable the government to restructure the sovereign wealth fund accordingly. Their resignation will \\u201cclear the deck to allow the government to restructure it\\u201d in line with policies of the new administration, he said, adding that the government was not on a witch-hunt.\n\\u00a0"}, "30": {"date_posted": "27/7/2018", "title": "Most SE Asian stocks rise; Philippines posts biggest weekly gain in over 1\\u00bd yrs", "article": " BENGALURU (July 27): Most Southeast Asian stock markets ended higher on Friday tracking broader Asia, with the Philippines marking its highest weekly close in more than 1\\u00bd years, but gains were limited as lingering US-Sino trade tensions kept investors watchful.

The group of companies affected included the Renong/UEM conglomerate, the MAS/TRI/Celcom group and the trio of MRCB/TV3/NSTP. All were controlled by individual businessmen. After their debts were restructured new capital was injected. The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) ended up in control of MRCB, TV 3 and NSTP. The other assets, however, ended up with Khazanah Nasional Bhd, the country\\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. Khazanah was started in 1993 under the Minister of Finance Inc (MoF Inc) to play a \\u201c catalytic role in driving various strategic and national initiatives\\u201d. Its involvement in the economy and corporate sector was transformed in a major way when it was tasked to take over those assets whose ownership had to be shifted to the government after the AFC. The term government-linked companies (GLCs) came into being in Malaysia after that. GLCs refer to privately incorporated companies (listed and unlisted) that are owned or controlled by the government. Khazanah itself is deemed a government-linked investment company (GLIC), as are Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB), the EPF, Kumpulan Wang Amanah Pencen (KWAP), Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera (LTAT) and Lembaga Tabung Haji (LUTH). Collectively these GLICs control a large component of companies listed on Bursa Malaysia. PNB, EPF and Khazanah are the biggest GLICs. The takeover of these companies and assets were not without issues and both Tan Sri Halim Saad (Renong/UEM) and Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli (MAS/TRI/Celcom) subsequently filed various lawsuits against the government and Khazanah, but lost. With important assets under it, Khazanah modelled itself after Singapore\\u2019s Temasek Holdings and over the past 12 years, grew its portfolio of both listed and unlisted assets and equities. Its realisable asset value as of Dec 31, 2017, was RM157.2 billion ringgit. After deducting debts and other liabilities, Khazanah\\u2019s net worth would be around RM116 billion. The value of its stakes in various listed companies on Bursa Malaysia as at July 10 was RM84 billion (see Table 1). \\u00a0These included controlling stakes in some of the country\\u2019s biggest companies like Axiata Group Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd. Given that the stock market has taken a pounding in the last two months, the value of these holdings could be worth much more. Khazanah also fully owns unlisted UEM Group Bhd and Malaysia Airlines Bhd (MAS). It has a 51% stake in PLUS Malaysia Bhd, with the EPF owning the remaining 49%. In 2017, Khazanah received RM2.367 billion in dividends from its core listed holdings, up from RM1.757 billion in 2016 (see Table 2). Since 2004, Khazanah has made accumulated profit before tax of RM28 billion and paid RM10.11 billion in dividends to MoF Inc (see Table 3). Another jewel is Khaznah\\u2019s 60% interest in the M+S joint venture with Singapore\\u2019s Temasek Holdings. The JV developed two projects \\u2014 Marina One in Marina Bay and Duo in Bugis \\u2014 that were the result of a 2010 land swap deal between the two governments. According to an M+S statement in January, the two projects had a gross development value of S$11 billion or RM33 billion. The land cost and shareholders injection was around S$4.0 billion and after deducting development costs, it is estimated that the profit could be as much as S$3.0 billion It is understood that M+S could generate around RM12 billion cash, including a profit of RM5.4 billion, for Khazanah if it sells the 60% stake. Will Khazanah assets be sold to raise cash for the government? In 2001, Khazanah was the vehicle used by the government to rehabilitate strategic assets back to good financial health. Given that Khazanah is today sitting on assets easily worth more than RM120 billion, will the government again turn to its sovereign wealth fund for help? The difference now is that this means Khazanah selling its assets to raise cash for the government. On paper, a sale of all Khazanah assets can raise over RM120 billion cash or around 12% of the governments RM1.0 trillion debt and contingent liabilities. This will certainly help shore up the government\\u2019s balance sheet.\n\\u00a0 Who will have the means to take over the Khazanah assets? If the government does an open tender, there will be no shortage of tycoons who will be interested and who will say they can raise the money by gearing themselves up. After all, some of these companies are profit-making machines so banks will be prepared to provide loans. But for individuals to borrow billions, the question of systemic risk to the banking system will arise. Do we want a repeat of what happened in 1997/98? The better solution, however, is to turn to other GLICs like the EPF and PNB. They have the money and they are in fact also shareholders in some of the Khazanah companies (see Tables 4 and 5). As at Dec 29, 2017, PNB had investments totalling RM198.9 billion on Bursa, including controlling interests in giants like Malayan Banking Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd and S P Setia Bhd. PNB also has shares in Khazanah-controlled GLCs like Axiata, Telekom and CIMB. The EPF is probably the ideal GLICs to buy Khazanah\\u2019s assets, if it is the intention of the government for Khazanah to divest. The EPF had RM302 billion invested in quoted equities as at Dec 31, 2017, of which RM158 billion was in domestic equities. It has controlling interests in RHB Bank Bhd, Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd and Malaysia Building Society Bhd (MBSB) with a total value of almost RM14.0 billion (see Table 5). EPF\\u2019s total investment assets is almost RM800 billion (see Table 6), making it the largest pool of investment money in the country, and each month, it receives an estimated RM2.0 billion in contributions. That is a whopping RM24 billion a year and EPF needs to continuously look for assets that can generate enough profits for it to pay its contributors dividends of at least 2.0 percentage points above inflation. If indeed the government feels it has no choice but to pare down its debts by selling assets held by Khazanah, the best way to do it would be to sell them tothe \\u00a0EPF, which has the money and has been a good money manager. As the EPF is also a big holder of government debt, Malaysian Government Securities or MGS (see Table 6), the sale of, say RM120 billion worth of Khazanah assets can help retire an equivalent amount of MGS. It should be noted, however, that should Khazanah sell its assets, it means that the government will no longer receive the sort of dividends it had been getting and will not benefit from any future increase in value of the GLCs that it sells."}, "32": {"date_posted": "24/7/2018", "title": "Most markets rise on financials", "article": " (July 24): Most Southeast Asian stock markets rose on Tuesday with Singapore heading for a fifth session of gains in six, driven by financials amid talks of a central bank policy tightening.\\u00a0 The Bank of Japan is in unusually active discussions before this month's policy decision, with changes to its interest-rate targets and stock-buying techniques on the table, Reuters reported on Friday, giving rise to speculation that the central bank may scale back its monetary stimulus more quickly than\nexpected.

Technically, the FBM KLCI is turning bullish in the short term as it rose above the short-term 30-day moving average. However, the index is still below the long-term 200-day moving average and the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. The Ichimoku Cloud remains bearish. Momentum indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI), moving average convergence divergence, and oscillator are increasing and this indicates that the bearish momentum in the past has eased. In fact, the RSI and oscillator indicators have increased above their mid-levels and this indicates that the sentiment is turning bullish in the short term. The market is staging a technical rebound. The rebound last week was quite strong and hence the bullish momentum may continue this week. However, the FBM KLCI may find resistance at 1,750 points based on the current down trend\\u2019s 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. The market confidence and trend may turn bullish if the index can break above this resistance level. If it fails to climb above this level, the market may resume its bearish trend. If it fails to rebound this week, the index may test the support level at 1,660 points again.

Yet the odds are stacked against the company rebounding in the near term due to uncertainties on multiple fronts. These uncertainties need to clear up before investors find TM appealing again, experts say. More on the challenges later. First, the 38% plunge in the telecommunications company\\u2019s share price and RM7.1 billion market capitalisation lost in the seven weeks post the May 9 general election. Closing at RM3.11 last Friday, the stock is at its lowest level since September 2011. The implied yield is 6% if TM can be counted on to pay at least 18.6 sen dividend per share, which would be roughly what every share gets if the total dividend payout stays at the minimum RM700 million. According to Bloomberg data, at least three analysts think TM will soon choose to revise its dividend policy \\u2014 as reflected by their dividend forecast of below 19 sen a share for 2018. If you believe the lowest dividend forecast of 12 sen, a 4% yield assumption would imply a RM3 share price \\u2014 the level to which TM fell intraday last week before recouping some losses. A 3.5% yield assumption would imply a RM3.40 share price while a 3% yield would imply RM4, back-of-the-envelope calculations show. At least seven analysts still see dividend at 19 sen, which reflects the promised minimum, while only one expects the 22 sen dividend paid in 2017 to be maintained this year. At its current share price, the broadband giant has little to lose and much to gain in terms of balance sheet flexibility if it were to vary the wording of its dividend policy from its decade-old promise of up to 90% of net profit or at least RM700 million, whichever is higher. Old-timers would remember that the dividend promise was made to provide investors with some comfort as TM embarked on a multibillion-ringgit high-speed broadband (HSBB) infrastructure investment, the backbone that today enables its UniFi broadband service as well as third-party broadband offerings. This was in 2008 when the sexier local and mobile business was spun off from TM and housed under Axiata Group Bhd. TM shares enjoyed something of a safe haven status because of the minimum dividend promise as investors chased dividend-paying stocks higher during the era of cheap debt. That era is coming to an end as interest rates normalise. TM\\u2019s share price plunge was probably exacerbated by fund repatriation from regional markets. The looming industry challenges mean that TM has to weather a storm. \\u00a0 In the eye of the storm The storm stems from the Pakatan Harapan government\\u2019s promise to halve the price of broadband while doubling its speed within five years to make internet affordable and accessible to people in \\u201call towns and villages across the country\\u201d. This is so that the power of the internet can be leveraged to create entrepreneurial opportunities and reduce the burden of the high cost of living. The government is right to see high-speed broadband as a basic necessity, just like water and electricity, as its ubiquitous availability at affordable prices would boost Malaysia\\u2019s economic competitiveness. Multimedia and Communications Minister Gobind Singh Deo has indicated that broadband prices will drop at least 25% in the next six months and TM has said the new prices will be revealed in the third quarter. For TM investors, however, broadband price cuts spell profit squeeze, which would directly affect the telco\\u2019s ability to invest and pay dividends. \\u201cA 10Mbps broadband package costs about RM130 per month. If you cut that by, say, RM50 a month, that\\u2019s a RM1.4 billion potential revenue loss in one year if you multiply that by 2.3 million customers over 12 months \\u2026 it\\u2019s not rocket science,\\u201d a seasoned telecoms analyst says, quantifying the size of the potential top-line loss. This also implies a potential earnings loss of some RM300 million if one were to assume 20% to 25% margins. TM had 1.18 million UniFi subscribers and 1.13 million broadband subscribers as at end-March 2018. Some 98% of UniFi subscribers are on 10Mbps speeds or higher. Last year, TM paid out RM808 million to shareholders. Operating revenue was RM12.09 billion and pre-tax profit was RM1.05 billion while profits attributable to equity holders stood at RM929.7 million. To maintain decent margins, TM will need to rework its cost structure, which means time, good leadership and strong execution, the analyst says, adding that while this is not the first time policymakers are pushing for lower broadband prices, the new government is seen as more serious about attaining its target. Eleven of the 15 analysts who updated their earnings estimate for TM after May 9 expect the telco to make less than RM700 million net profit for 2018 and six of them expect 2019 earnings to be below this year\\u2019s, Bloomberg data showed at the time of writing. TM paid its shareholders more than RM930 million in dividends in FY2014 and kept the amount at more than RM800 million a year between FY2015 and FY2017 \\u2014 a threshold that appears challenging in the near term. Adding to the 50% price-cut scare are the uncertainties about what looks like a directive to TM to let rivals ride its infrastructure at cheaper prices. As the wholesale prices at which TM sells broadband capacity to rivals are not known, it is hard for outsiders to gauge the potential impact of the policy, experts say. What is certain, however, is that all industry players, not just TM, would need to look again at their cost structure and work out a formula that would help them build a profitable and sustainable business while selling broadband to consumers at prices the new government wants. \\u201cA good grasp of the cost of providing the broadband service and the ongoing investments necessary to maintain a top-notch backbone for the country\\u2019s economy would help policymakers determine what needs to change and at what prices broadband can and should be sold to consumers,\\u201d an observer says. Could M&A be on the cards, given the changes that industry players are faced with? \\u201cWho is going to drive change? Is it safe to bet on top-down direction in the near to medium term, be it a restructuring, a merger or just cost-cutting?\\u201d another veteran industry observer says when asked about the possible remerger of TM and Axiata or at least the merging of all local or mobile units under one entity. \\u201cRealistically, it has only been about 50 days [since GE14]; we\\u2019re talking about the overhauling of the government, key institutions and the entire economy. Change will take time, the policymakers will need time,\\u201d he adds. He, for one, does not expect any major corporate exercise before the dust settles. Khazanah Nasional Bhd owned 26.2% of TM as well as 37.3% of Axiata as at end-March 2018 and counts both companies among its key strategic investments. The Employees Provident Fund owned 17.88% of TM and 16.72% of Axiata as at end-March while Permodalan Nasional Bhd had 21% of Telekom and 18% of Axiata as at end-December 2017. Together, the trio owns about 65% of Telekom and 72% of Axiata. \\u00a0"}, "40": {"date_posted": "11/7/2018", "title": "Most fall as China-U.S. trade spat ramps up", "article": " (July 11): Southeast Asian stock markets fell on Wednesday, with Singapore erasing some of the last two sessions' gains and Vietnam extending losses to a third session, as Washington warned of tariffs on an additional US$200 billion worth of Chinese imports, escalating the trade dispute.

The index rebounded this week and closed at 1,687.13 points yesterday. Trading volume increased last week but trading value fell significantly. The average daily trading volume increased to 2.1 billion shares from two billion shares two weeks ago and the average daily trading value fell to RM1.7 billion from RM2.3 billion. This indicated more low-capped counters normally traded by retail-market participants were being traded. Foreign institutions continued to reduce market exposure. Net sell from foreign institutions was RM704 million while net buys from local institutions and local retail investors were RM589 million and RM115 million respectively. For the FBM KLCI, decliners beat gainers 19 to eight while three stocks were unchanged. The top three gainers were Telekom Malaysia Bhd (+9.3% to RM3.40), Dialog Group Bhd (+1.9% to RM3.15), and Axiata Group Bhd (+1.3% to RM3.85). Top decliners were Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd (-6.9% to RM4.06), RHB Bank Bhd (-5.3% to RM5.17), and KLCC Property Stapled Group (-4.8% to RM7.62). In the global scene, Asian markets were bearish and the fall was led by a 3.5% decline in the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index. European and US markets were slightly bullish while London closed marginally lower on a week-on-week basis. The US dollar index, which measures the US dollar against a basket of major currencies, closed slightly lower at 94 points last Friday. The ringgit was firm against the greenback at 4.04 to a US dollar last Friday. Safe investment haven gold rebounded from a six-month low and finished marginally higher in a week. Gold (COMEX) increased 0.1% in a week to US$1,255.90 (RM5,036.16) an ounce. Crude oil, on the other hand, fell 2.7% in a week to US$77.29 a barrel. In the local market, crude palm oil futures declined 2.5% in a week to RM2,264 per tonne last Friday on demand worries. Last week, we were expecting the FBM KLCI to stage a technical rebound but that clearly did not happen. This indicated that the market sentiment was still bearish. Immediate support level is at 1,658 points and further declines are expected if this level is broken. Immediate resistance level is at 1,702 and the trend can only turn bullish in the short term if it breaks above this level. Technically, the FBM KLCI remains bearish below both the short- and long-term 30- and 200-day moving averages and these averages continue to decline. The 30-day moving average is currently at 1,727 points. Furthermore, the index is below the Ichimoku Cloud and the expanding Cloud indicates a strong bearish trend. Momentum indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI), moving average convergence divergence, and momentum oscillator are starting to decline after rebounding two weeks ago. This shows a strong bearish momentum. The RSI and Momentum Oscillator also indicate that the FBM KLCI is oversold. With the strengthening bearish momentum, the index is expected to continue despite being technically oversold. It seems that the market has more bearish than bullish catalysts. Trade war between the US and China, weaker ringgit, and continuous foreign institutions\\u2019 selling send negative vibes to the market since the general election two months ago.

It noted growing risks and headwinds to global growth in terms of rising interest rates globally, spearheaded by the US Federal Reserve\\u2019s ongoing interest rate hikes, compounded by the beginning of the end of the major central banks\\u2019 quantitative easing policy. These in turn are causing volatility and corrections in financial markets due to the repricing of growth and policy outlook. \\u201cThere are also signs of China\\u2019s economy slowing due to the impact of \\u2018deleveraging and de-risking\\u2019 policy.

For perspective, the declines in the component stocks saw about RM39 billion in market capitalisation wiped off. According to Kenny Yee, Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd\\u2019s head of research, the sharp declines seen in the component stocks have created buying opportunities for investors with a long-term horizon. \\u201cThis [decline] is on the back of some of the reforms under the new government, which is likely to create a more transparent, competitive environment among Malaysia corporates \\u2014 it is good for the long term,\\u201d Yee said, pointing out that the weakness in the index is similar to the selling pressure experienced in other emerging markets. Nonetheless, Yee said investors\\u2019 risk appetite will improve when corporate earnings growth shows more visibility moving forward. The declines among the benchmark stocks yesterday were led by the telecommunications sector, which was hurt by the swift action and magnitude of the 25% cut to broadband prices by the new government. Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) plunged by 13.5% yesterday to close at RM3.14. It has already lost about 49.1% or about RM11.9 billion of its value in 2018.

Other big movers included Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB), which dropped by 2.24% to close at RM13.94, a seven-month low. Year to date, TNB has lost about RM7.3 billion in market capitalisation.

Areca Capital Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Danny Wong, however, told The Edge Financial Daily that the FBM KLCI index itself did not represent the Malaysian stock market and investors should allocate money to the right sectors and stocks at this moment. Wong shared that investors with a longer-term horizon, such as one year, could look at companies or sectors that will benefit from the latest development on both the local and global landscape. \\u201cFor example, with the US\\u2019 rising interest rates expected moving forward, this will affect and strengthen the US dollar, which could benefit exporters [in general]. Other sectors such as construction and building materials could expect to be in the spotlight for a while with some of the cancellation and delay in projects by the new government. So, it might be a sector that one would want to avoid for a while. Consumption is improving so the consumer sector might also be another area to look at,\\u201d he said. Wong, however, noted that investors need to look at companies in specifics, especially given the volatility in the stock market. On that note, he said the FBM KLCI component stocks might not see a recovery across the board. Instead, the recovery could be within selective sectors such as banking, which might benefit from a higher loan growth. \\u00a0"}, "53": {"date_posted": "21/6/2018", "title": "Philippine shares slump 2%, move further into bear territory", "article": " (June 21): Philippine shares slumped 2% on Thursday and moved further into bear territory on persistent foreign investor selling, largely sparked by a weak peso which hit a 12-year low earlier this week.

A compilation by The Edge shows that following a post-election stock market meltdown, the value of EPF\\u2019s investment in the 10 companies has declined dramatically from RM51.21 billion to RM45.12 billion within a month (see table). The top 10 worst performing stocks in EPF\\u2019s portfolio in the past one month are Cahya Mata Sarawak Bhd (CMS), Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB), IJM Corp Bhd, Gamuda Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), Axiata Group Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) and Genting Plantations Bhd. The construction sector is the worst hit due to the new Pakatan Harapan (PH) government\\u2019s reviews on mega infrastructure projects, namely the East Coast Rail Line (ECRL), the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail (HSR) project and the third mass rapid transit line (MRT3). CMS topped the list in terms of the quantum of the fall in share price. The diversified group\\u2019s share price has tumbled 37%, wiping off RM1.7 billion from its market capitalisation. As a result, EPF, which has a 10.69% stake in the company, saw its value of investment drop by RM180 million. Both MRCB and IJM saw their share prices fall 32%, wiping off RM1.4 billion and RM3.1 billion from their market cap respectively. Consequently, EPF, which has a 35.32% stake in MRCB, saw its investment value shrink by RM490 million. Meanwhile, its 14.5% stake value in IJM also dropped by RM450 million. Gamuda\\u2019s shares have declined 28%, wiping off RM3.7 billion from its market cap. Hence, EPF\\u2019s 10.11% stake value also dropped by RM370 million. While construction stocks are the top losers in the selling wave post-election, the two banking stocks and two telcos, namely Maybank, CIMB, TM and Axiata, have actually caused EPF\\u2019s investment value in PLCs to shrink even more. In total, EPF has lost RM3.86 billion in investment value in the four government-linked companies (GLCs) within a month. As the share prices of Maybank, Axiata, CIMB and TM have declined 7%, 12%, 8% and 21% respectively since GE14, EPF\\u2019s loss in value on paper from these companies are RM1.06 billion, RM990 million, RM730 million and RM690 million respectively. But it was the decline in the share price of TNB that hurt EPF\\u2019s investment value the most. The utility giant saw RM8.5 billion wiped out from its market cap. As a result, EPF, which has a 12.67% stake in the company, saw its investment value shrink 9% or RM1.08 billion. EPF\\u2019s equity investment value of RM338.72 billion in the first quarter of this year represents 41.6% of its total asset portfolio of RM814.38 billion. Equities remain the single largest asset class for EPF. A check on EPF\\u2019s website shows that the provident fund\\u2019s equity investment value contracted from RM344.35 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 to RM338.72 billion in the first quarter this year. This represents a drop of 1.6% or RM5.63 billion.\n\\u00a0 Biting the bullet In a bid to control the country\\u2019s debt load in excess of RM1 trillion, the government has scrapped the MRT3 and HSR projects, at least for now, while the ECRL is still being reviewed. The MMC Corp Bhd-Gamuda-George Kent (M) Bhd joint venture was widely seen as the strongest contender to undertake the MRT3 project before it was cancelled. Gamuda is hoping that the project will be revived as the Circle Line will integrate the existing public rail services in the Klang Valley. MRT3 is the final alignment of the MRT series of urban rail networks. It was supposed to link with MRT1 \\u2014 running from Sungai Buloh to Kajang \\u2014 and MRT2 (from Sungai Buloh to Putrajaya), whose construction is ongoing. It is worth noting that negotiations on the HSR project delivery partner agreement with the government were also suspended late last month. In April, the MRCB-Gamuda consortium had been selected for the northern portion of the HSR project alignment while another consortium \\u2014 Syarikat Pembenaan Yeoh Tiong Lay Sdn Bhd-TH Properties Sdn Bhd \\u2014 had been picked for the southern part. CMS\\u2019 shares have also taken a beating due to negative market sentiment towards stocks that are seen as politically linked to the previous Barisan Nasional government. CMS\\u2019 biggest exposure is the Pan Borneo Highway and federal road maintenance jobs covering about 200km. There has been suggestion that state road concessions in Sarawak be awarded via open tender.

Asian shares fell on Monday after US President Donald Trump cranked up trade tensions by going ahead with tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to immediately respond in kind, according to Reuters. Fears of a global trade war added to pressure on oil prices, which extended Friday's big fall, while the US dollar retreated from near three-week highs against the safe haven yen, it said. Hong Leong IB Research said that in the US, the threat of a trade war may extend pressure on stock markets as the Trump administration could be looking at an additional US$100 billion in import tariffs on China goods. \"Hence, the upside on the Dow may be capped over the near term. \"With the resurfacing of trade war concerns between the US and China, we think the trading sentiment could turn slightly negative throughout the regional bourses, affecting the FBM KLCI's performance, eventually.

Corporate earnings have been rather disappointing for the first quarter of 2018, with most companies missing expectations. Their performance is the main factor that drives the market. The unexciting corporate results will not augur well for the local bourse, at least in the next few months, amid a lack of fresh catalysts. The numbers were down across most sectors, with only the banking sector seeing good performance in terms of profit growth. The improved earnings by the banks were due to lower provisions for non-performing loans. Malayan Banking Bhd achieved 9.7% year-on-year growth in its net profit to RM1.87 billion in the first quarter ended March 31. Revenue rose 2.1% to RM11.52 billion. Maybank attributed the improvement to higher net interest income and Islamic banking income. Hong Leong Bank Bhd saw a 21.2% y-o-y jump in net profit to RM690.03 million in its third financial quarter ended March 31, 2018 (3QFY2018), on higher net income, lower allowance for impairment losses on loans, advances and financing, and higher share of profit from an associated company. The banks aside, corporate earnings were generally down, says Inter-Pacific Securities research head Pong Teng Siew. \\u201cIt was disappointing and I might even say that it was bad across the board. I would estimate that only 7% to 8% of the companies listed on Bursa Malaysia posted bottom-line growth in the first quarter,\\u201d he tells The Edge. Export-oriented counters such as furniture makers generally saw a decline in their net profits in the absence of foreign exchange gain as a result of a stronger ringgit against the US dollar. Lii Hen Industries Bhd saw its net profit drop 63.2% y-o-y to RM8.13 million in the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 (1QFY2018), while Latitude Tree Holdings Bhd\\u2019s net profit plunged 79.2% y-o-y to RM2.4 million. The stronger ringgit also had an adverse effect on plantation counter Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd, which saw its net profit fall 34.6% y-o-y to RM189.27 million in the second financial quarter ended March 31, 2018 (2QFY2018). Meanwhile, Felda Global Ventures Bhd\\u2019s 1QFY2018 net profit declined 21.9% y-o-y to RM1.33 million. The drop in earnings was attributed to a lower average crude palm oil price of RM2,472 per tonne compared with RM3,061 in 2017. Other notable companies that missed forecasts include Axiata Group Bhd, which reported a net loss of RM147.41 million, versus a net profit of RM239.02 million in the previous year, due to a higher share of losses from its Indian associate Idea Cellular Ltd. CIMB Investment Bank has downgraded the counter to a \\u201chold\\u201d with a lower target price of RM5. It expects the group to post a 14% drop in earnings per share for FY2018 before rebounding in FY2019 and FY2020. Other heavyweights that registered lower profits include Telekom Malaysia Bhd and MISC Bhd. TM saw its net profit fall 32% y-o-y to RM157.16 million while MISC posted a 54.1% drop in net profit to RM310.6 million. Press Metal Holdings Bhd, which registered a 1.6% y-o-y growth in net profit to RM150.48 million, also missed expectations due to lower-than-expected aluminium selling prices realised, higher cost of carbon anode and the stronger ringgit. \\u201cIt has been another disappointing quarter. Many companies performed below expectations ... the market largely expected some improvement in corporate earnings in the first quarter. \\u201cMost sectors were down. Those with exposure to foreign exchange were affected by the stronger ringgit. They include the plantation, timber and technology sectors. I\\u2019m expecting more negative earnings revisions than positive ones after the results season ends,\\u201d Areca Capital CEO Danny Wong tells The Edge. He says the market was expecting some improvement in the first quarter of the year amid steady global growth. He notes that some construction companies had several contracts in hand, which were expected to give the sector a boost. However, this was not the case. IJM Corp Bhd posted a net profit of RM11.19 million, down 95.3% y-o-y. The big variance was mainly due to a one-off gain of RM123.1 million in the previous year and lower contributions from its five main segments. The group also saw a lower net unrealised foreign exchange gain for the quarter. Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd, despite posting 150% y-o-y growth in its net profit to RM21.5 million in 1QFY2018, also came in below expectations, according to MIDF Research. The earnings represent only 10.6% of the research house\\u2019s estimates. AmInvestment Bank head of equity research Joshua Ng says the earnings reporting season was unremarkable with Sime Darby Bhd being the only FBM KLCI component stock that has surprised on the upside on better sales by its car dealerships in China and heavy equipment business in Australia. \\u201cAfter factoring in the changes thus far, our FBM KLCI earnings growth forecast for 2018 has been revised to 5.4% (from 6.8%) and 2019 to 6.8% (from 7.2%),\\u201d writes Ng in a June 1 note. Moving forward, AmInvestment Bank says, the removal of the Goods and Services Tax, reintroduction of petrol subsidy and the gradual abolition of highway tolls will increase consumers\\u2019 propensity to spend. The research house prefers Public Bank Bhd and BIMB Holdings Bhd for their exposure to consumer spending, besides consumer and automotive stocks such as Berjaya Food Bhd, Power Root Bhd and Bermaz Auto Bhd. It also likes exporters that benefit from strong external demand such as Top Glove Corp Bhd, VS Industry Bhd and Inari Amertron Bhd as well as certain defensive oil and gas counters, such as Yinson Holdings Bhd and Dialog Bhd, amid stable crude oil prices. Looking towards the second quarter of the year, Areca Capital\\u2019s Wong says he expects certain sectors to be positive such as consumers, automotive, banking and healthcare, amid better consumer sentiment. \\u201cThe removal of GST will have a positive effect on consumer spending and it is particularly so for the automotive sector. Companies that import cars such as Sime Darby will benefit,\\u201d he says. \\u201cImproved consumer sentiment will translate into higher spending, which is positive for the retail sector.\\u201d On the other hand, he says, the earnings of export-oriented counters that are not actively expanding will continue to be affected by the stronger ringgit. \\u00a0 \\u00a0"}, "60": {"date_posted": "11/6/2018", "title": "Lead Story: Market shock wave may see analyst downgrades", "article": " THE FBM KLCI has been on a rough ride over the past week as the government\\u2019s onion-peeling approach to announcing its policy changes and reforms spooked investors while market sentiment turned even more fragile. Last Monday, the government triggered another shock wave when it said it had decided to scrap the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail. Two days later, it announced the cancellation of the Mass Rapid Transit 3 project. The benchmark FBM KLCI saw its worse single-day fall since 2008 last Wednesday, plunging 3.52% to a month-and-a-half low of 1,719.28, before recovering some of its losses on Friday to close at 1,756.38 points. The week before, the local bourse had also succumbed to a heavy selldown after the government revealed that the country\\u2019s liabilities had breached RM1 trillion. The exit of foreign investors from emerging market equities during the week ended May 25, amid external factors such as the trade dispute between the US and China as well as the US-North Korea summit being called off, also contributed to the decline. Disappointing corporate earnings for the first quarter of the year, as well as anticipation of further announcements by the government, exacerbated the generally uncertain environment, causing several research houses to mull revising their views on the local market and year-end FBM KLCI targets. Nomura Holdings Inc downgraded Malaysian equities to \\u201cneutral\\u201d from \\u201coverweight\\u201d, citing near-term uncertainties and negative news flow on the removal of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the reintroduction of fuel subsidies, which could pose a drag on Malaysia\\u2019s financials, and economic and earnings growth rates. The research house says a drag in investment growth rates could impact credit growth and, subsequently, earnings for the index, highlighting that 40% of the FBM KLCI\\u2019s earnings come from Malaysian banks. It adds that there is a potential risk of deteriorating business sentiment amid the policy uncertainty. \\u201cHowever, we are reluctant to be underweight as we hope the new government will come out with policies which address the fiscal concerns as well as embark on reforms which potentially could improve investor sentiment in the medium term.\\u201d Based on previous experience, Nomura adds that the push for reforms, or even the \\u201chope\\u201d of reforms, can be powerful catalysts for stock market rallies, noting the case of India and Indonesia in 2014 and 2015. The research house says it would like to see reforms in government procurement, reduction in corruption and crony capitalism and the potential rolling back of government involvement in certain areas to promote a level playing field with the private sector. UOB Kay Hian, meanwhile, says it is looking to revise downwards its year-end target from its existing forecast of 1,830 amid the \\u201csombre\\u201d first-quarter earnings season. \\u201cThere is downside to our 2018 target of 1,830 (based on 15.7 times 2019 PER) given that the 1Q2018 reporting season has disappointed, particularly in the telecom industry,\\u201d says UOB Kay Hian head of equity research Vincent Khoo. He adds that the government\\u2019s decision on toll payments is keeping investors on edge, amid fears over government debt and the ramifications from the scrapping of mega projects. However, Khoo says the selldown of major construction companies with tolled expressways such as IJM Corp Bhd and Gamuda Bhd is overdone, as investors priced in the possibility of the government undercompensating the concessionaires. \\u201cWe expect the government to undertake a more pragmatic solution that would be acceptable to the capital market, being fully aware that short-changing the toll concessionaires would broaden investor concerns well beyond the construction sector,\\u201d he adds. MIDF Research head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman also indicates that the research house may review its year-end forecast for the FBM KLCI after reviewing corporate earnings for the first quarter. \\u201cWe might review it and there might potentially be a downgrade from our year-end target of 1,900 points, pending our assessment of the latest corporate earnings. While the banks look good, our concerns lie in the major constituents like Axiata Group Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd, plantation and property counters,\\u201d he tells The Edge. But not all are that pessimistic. AmBank Research says the disappointing first-quarter performance did not jeopardise the growth trajectory of the FBM KLCI\\u2019s earnings and forecasts growth of 6.3% and 7.1% for 2018 and 2019 respectively, on the back of expected gross domestic product growth of 5.5% and 5.3% respectively. \\u201cWe have year-end targets of 1,900 points and 2,040 points in 2018 and 2019 respectively for the FBM KLCI, based on 18.5 times 2018 and 2019 earnings respectively,\\u201d AmBank Research analyst Joshua Ng writes in a note. He says the FBM KLCI will be driven by a cyclical upturn in corporate earnings growth and the introduction of high PER stocks in the recent round of changes to the FBM KLCI component stocks, namely Press Metal Holdings Bhd, Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd, Dialog Group Bhd, Hartalega Holdings Bhd and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd. He adds that greater clarity in the new government\\u2019s policies, along with potential improvement in sentiment on emerging markets and a more level playing field across sectors, are key catalysts for the benchmark index. Meanwhile, downside risks include stronger-than-expected US inflation and wage growth, which increases the probability of a steeper rate hike in the US and a stronger greenback, an escalation in geopolitical tensions and earnings disappointments from FBM KLCI heavyweights like banks, telcos and Tenaga Nasional Bhd. Inter-Pacific Securities head of research Pong Teng Siew also maintains his year-end target of 1,890 points despite the recent developments, although he reiterates that the index is unlikely to touch a new high this year. \\u201cGenerally, the FBM KLCI takes a while to climb but when sentiment is down, it drops fast, like how we have seen the pullback in recent weeks. It took less than two months for the index to climb to its all-time high in April, so it will like take two or three times the duration for the FBM KLCI to recover to previous levels,\\u201d he tells The Edge. \\u00a0 \\u00a0"}, "61": {"date_posted": "28/5/2018", "title": "KLCI dips 0.85% as Public Bank, Tenaga drag", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (May 28): The FBM KLCI fell 0.85% in early trade this morning, dragged by losses including at Public Bank Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd.

In April last year, it signed a collaboration agreement with AEON Credit Service (M) Bhd to enable the use of gold investments on HelloGold as collateral for loans. \\u00a0 Investing in gold through e-wallets a trend Lee\\u2019s goal in the partnership with Axiata is for HelloGold to be fully integrated with Boost so its customers can buy gold directly from the wallet instead of going through the HelloGold app. \\u201cWe believe that differentiating e-wallets through financial products like ours enables our partners to have an advantage over everyone else,\\u201d he says. Buying and selling small amounts of gold through e-wallets is already a trend in China and India \\u2014 two countries where gold is a popular form of investment. In 2017, Chinese financial services giant Tencent launched Tencent Micro-Gold, a platform built into its popular WeChat platform, which allows users to purchase and sell small amounts of gold through WeChat Payment. The platform got a boost during the 2017 Chinese New Year season when 70,000 virtual \\u201cred packets\\u201d of gold were sent across the platform, according to reports. The platform was built in partnership with China\\u2019s largest bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). Lee was chief financial officer of the World Gold Council (WGC) from 2010 to 2014. During his tenure, he worked with ICBC to launch gold investment products. \\u201cChina is a great example. Up until 2011, the primary method through which people bought gold was by going to the jewellery store and the bank and buying a piece of jewellery or a bar. Then the World Gold Council and ICBC worked together to launch ICBC\\u2019s gold product, which was to buy gold for RMB1, and it just took off like wildfire. It became incredibly successful so much so that all the other banks started to replicate it,\\u201d he says. In India, popular digital payment platform Paytm launched a similar digital gold investment platform in April last year, which allows users to buy gold for as little as one rupee. \\u201cIn the research that the World Gold Council did a long time ago when I was still with it, what came out very clearly was that nearly everyone is interested in saving through gold. The biggest challenge was figuring out a method that was accessible, safe and affordable in terms of transaction size, and we believe we\\u2019ve created something that addresses all these pain points,\\u201d Lee says. \\u00a0 Using digital gold investments as collateral The product HelloGold is launching with AEON Credit is expected to come to market this quarter. The idea is for AEON Credit to provide loans to customers who purchase between RM1,000 and RM10,000 worth of gold on HelloGold\\u2019s platform, with a profit rate of 8% per annum. \\u201cImagine if you have RM2,000 worth of gold you\\u2019re saving for your children\\u2019s education, and you need a motorcycle but you don\\u2019t want to sell your gold. So just like the rich and mass affluent (who can get loans using their investment portfolios), we will use that gold and collaterise it for your motorcycle so the lender has added security against the loan,\\u201d Lee says. The two parties are in the process of finalising the product. The current plan is to offer a 70% loan-to-value ratio. The amount of gold offered as collateral will be frozen until the loan is repaid. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 Buying gold at international spot prices \\u00a0 Since the HelloGold platform was launched in Malaysia in late 2016, 15,000 customers have signed up, according to its CEO Robin Lee. The company is planning to launch in Thailand and Dubai this year. For the purpose of transparency, the company publishes a list of its customers on its website every day so users can see how much gold is held by each customer, represented by a unique number. It also publishes a list of the gold bars it holds, with serial numbers, at the end of each day, which should always be higher than what is held by customers. As at May 6, the amount held by customers was 9478.618 grams, according to HelloGold\\u2019s website. It currently holds 11 gold bars in BullionStar International\\u2019s secure gold vault in Singapore. The company uses 99.99% investment-grade, one kilogram gold bars that are fully allocated. The gold bars are audited every six months and fully insured by a third-party insurer. If customers choose to redeem, the minimum size is one gram. The convenience of investing through HelloGold is that investors do not have to keep physical gold, and they can buy and sell anytime. \\u201cTypically, most people don\\u2019t ask for physical gold. We\\u2019ve been in operation for the better part of the year now, and I would say in that time, most of our transactions have been buys. I think out of 10,000 transactions, we\\u2019ve only had five physical redemptions,\\u201d Lee says. HelloGold enables investors to buy gold at international spot prices. It charges a 2% fee on the value of each buy or sell transaction and an annual management fee of 2%. Customers who want to redeem physical gold bars will have to pay additional charges for shipping and insurance. One advantage of investing through HelloGold is the ability to buy small amounts of gold at the international spot price instead of paying a premium, Lee says. \\u201cIf you buy one gram of gold, you are in this weird situation where you\\u2019re buying something that\\u2019s worth RM176 at RM220. You\\u2019re paying a huge premium for it [because of the small amount].\\u201d This can be avoided\\u00a0 with HelloGold because it buys gold in bulk and passes on the savings to the customers. \\u201cIt\\u2019s no different from carrying stock. We\\u2019re just carrying what we believe we need, and as people buy gold, we go out and buy more gold at the prevailing market price and restock our inventory. As more people sell gold back to us, we give them back cash, and we then sell gold back to the market at the prevailing spot price,\\u201d Lee says. HelloGold\\u2019s target audience is the average investor who may not be able to invest in vehicles such as gold funds, which typically require a higher minimum amount. \\u201cOur average ticket size is between RM50 and RM100, so it is less than a gram of gold. We\\u2019re here to serve the folks that most financial services providers can\\u2019t serve because the economic system doesn\\u2019t work for them,\\u201d says Lee. Gold remains a safe haven asset, he opines, especially with the current economic and geopolitical challenges. \\u201cTypically, gold in the long run has historically kept pace with local inflation. It\\u2019s always a good time to buy gold because it\\u2019s going to be better than cash.\\u201d"}, "65": {"date_posted": "24/5/2018", "title": "KLCI is region\\u2019s worst performer", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: The local bourse benchmark, the FBM KLCI, was the worst performing index in the Asia-Pacific region yesterday, falling 2.21% or 40.78 points at 1,804.25 points as new Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng and Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad revealed more details on the country\\u2019s fiscal position, especially the government\\u2019s actual debt of RM1 trillion. It was the biggest one-day decline in over two years for the benchmark index, while the entire stock exchange saw RM31.7 billion wiped off the market in a single trading day, with 763 decliners and 237 gainers. Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of research Vincent Lau remains positive on the Malaysian stock market despite the sharp decline seen and urges investors to look past the \\u201cnoises\\u201d dominating headlines. \\u201cIf you look at the index, the drop is quite drastic. The RM1 trillion headline has spooked the market. There are also some headwinds on the external front causing a selldown as seen in the region,\\u201d Lau said. He reckons it is still too early to consider a downgrade on Malaysia\\u2019s credit rating as the new government has just taken over and rating agencies are likely to take some time to evaluate policy changes. \\u201cI also think the impact from a downgrade on small- and mid-cap companies would be limited as these companies\\u2019 borrowings are likely to be coming from local banks. While it\\u2019s true the borrowing costs could be higher, the impact will not be significant,\\u201d Lau added. He is also optimistic that the \\u201cnew Malaysia\\u201d euphoria could translate into something positive, as a more prudent, transparent and open government means better governance, benefiting businesses in the long term. Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd head of retail research Loui Low agrees, pointing out concerns about the nation\\u2019s debt management and a possible shortfall in tax collection, following the announcement that the goods and services tax (GST) will be zero-rated effective June 1 this year, have contributed to the selldown. He said some of the corporate results have dampened investor sentiment as well. Telecommunications group Axiata Group Bhd, posting a net loss of RM147.41 million in the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 (1QFY18) compared to a net profit of RM239.02 million a year ago, fell 12.6% or 64 sen to RM4.43, with about eight million shares traded. \\u201cThe support level for the [FBM] KLCI is at 1,800 and the resistance is at 1,830, based on MACD (moving average convergence/divergence),\\u201d Low noted. Areca Capital Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Danny Wong concurred with Low that the removal of the GST and the potential abolishment of toll concessions have led to concerns over how the new government would replace these revenue shortfalls. \\u201cThere is also the RM1 trillion debt level that the ministers have talked about although it\\u2019s not really a new thing,\\u201d Wong said, noting that while no further explanation is given on the RM1 trillion debt, it likely includes government guaranteed (GG) debt, at RM226.88 billion as at Sept 30 last year. As most stocks fell, Wong believes there are pockets of opportunities and value emerging for some sectors such as banking, a proxy to a stronger economic growth, which is expected. Wong, however, said uncertainties on the global front are also driving the market down as US President Donald Trump said he is \\u201cnot really\\u201d happy with the trade negotiations with China and also warned that the summit with North Korea could be delayed. Meanwhile, foreign investors continued to sell their holdings with a net sell of RM286.8 million yesterday. In contrast, retailers and local institutions remained net buyers with RM89.9 million and RM196.9 million respectively. Some of yesterday\\u2019s decliners included those viewed to have benefited from direct negotiation contracts with the previous government. E-government solutions provider My EG Services Bhd fell 2.1% yesterday at 91.5 sen. My EG has fallen 64.5% since just before the 14th general election. Construction players were impacted as well, amid rising concerns over the review of infrastructure projects. Construction player George Kent (M) Bhd, perceived to be linked to former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, fell 8.1% to RM1.48 yesterday. However, an analyst requesting anonymity said the Pakatan Harapan government is trying to downplay expectations by highlighting some of the country\\u2019s financial problems. \\u201cI think the RM1 trillion debt is just being highlighted to manage expectations. If you look at the numbers, it\\u2019s not something new [if taking into consideration the GG debt). Of course, there is not much clarification by the ministers at the moment,\\u201d he said. Nevertheless, he is positive on some of the new government\\u2019s measures to curb its operating expenditure such as the 10% deduction in salary for ministers, the abolishment of the Land Public Transport Commission, which will be absorbed into the transport ministry, and the government\\u2019s commitment to reduce the RM1 trillion debt. \\u201cWhile I think it\\u2019s not possible to reduce the fiscal deficit with the measures mentioned, and it remains net negative given the removal of GST and the potential removal of tolls, it is however a good start,\\u201d he said."}, "66": {"date_posted": "24/5/2018", "title": "KLCI seen paring losses on mild bargain hunting activities", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (May 24): The FBM KLCI is expected to recoup some of its losses today, on some mild bargain hunting actitivities in line with the overnight recovery at most global markets.

What is even more impressive is that during the last one year, about 22.5% or 207 of the companies listed on Bursa Malaysia have touched their all-time highs while about 50% of these companies recorded new highs this year. A look at companies on Bursa reveals that there is another set of companies \\u2014 making up 20% of listed counters \\u2014 that has been overlooked after hitting record highs between 2013 and 2015. Notably, oil price collapsed in mid-2014. Recall that the Malaysian stock market saw a sharp decline following the collapse of crude oil prices, with the FBM KLCI falling to its five-year low of 1,532.14 in August 2015. However, despite the strong recovery in the FBM KLCI, most of these companies that hit their all-time highs before the oil price collapse are still lagging far behind, by an average of 47.5%. Some analysts believe that some of these counters could see a gradual recovery, especially the oil and gas (O&G) players, given the rally in oil prices recently. Abel Goon, an analyst with TA Securities, told The Edge Financial Daily that a sustained level in oil price will benefit some of the O&G counters on Bursa, especially if it translates into higher capital expenditure (capex) among O&G majors. \\u201cIf you look at the Malaysian stock market, a lot of the oil and gas counters are related to services and will not benefit directly from the increase in the oil prices. If oil prices can sustain at this level and encourage capex, it will lead to more activities for players like UMW Oil and Gas Corp Bhd, Sapura Energy Bhd and others,\\u201d Goon explained. He pointed out that counters like Hibiscus Petroleum Bhd and Dagang NeXchange Bhd could benefit directly from the rise in oil prices. Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of research Vincent Lau concurred, pointing out that sentiment in the O&G industry has definitely improved as seen by the share price rally in some of the counters such as Sapura Energy. Other laggards such as Malaysia Building Society Bhd (MBSB), which is now a full-fledged Islamic bank, could also benefit as there are not a lot of Islamic bank counters available on the exchange, he noted. MBSB closed at RM1.15, which is about 50.9% off its all-time high of RM2.34 recorded in 2013. Other sectors such as telecommunications could also see a return of interest among investors if they can sustain earnings amid a competitive environment. While telcos may still need time to prove themselves, Lau said recent adjustments made to their products to stay ahead of competition were not done at the expense of the players\\u2019 existing pricing, which is a positive for the sector. Maxis Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd and DiGi.com Bhd are on average about 18% below their all-time highs. For other past winners, it remains uncertain if they can regain their former glory. For example, British American Tobacco (Malaysia) Bhd (BAT Malaysia) has fallen by 60.6% from its all-time high of RM63 recorded in 2014. For its financial year ended Dec 31, 2014 (FY14), BAT Malaysia posted a revenue of RM18.6 billion and a net income of about RM902.9 million. Its latest set of financials for FY17 paled in comparison as group revenue fell by more than half to RM7.1 billion while net profit fell by 44.6% to RM500 million. \\u00a0 The performers As for the 207 companies that touched their all-time highs in the last one year, most of them have benefited from the oil price collapse, a weak ringgit as well as the many mega infrastructure projects that were announced. Infrastructure projects that were announced by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak (now caretaker prime minister) have spurred most of the construction players that were awarded contracts related to most of the infrastructure projects. Gamuda Bhd, Lingkaran Trans Kota Holdings Bhd, George Kent (Malaysia) Bhd and Ekovest Bhd were some of the companies that saw strong growth during this time, which also coincided with the rally in their share prices. Exporters of semiconductors, gloves, consumer products and\\u00a0 furniture benefited from the weak ringgit at the time. Strong demand for electrical and electronic goods has also benefited Malaysia\\u2019s semiconductor industry. The banking sector also saw a recovery from some of the impairment losses that were recorded when oil prices collapsed and are back on investors\\u2019 radar as seen by the recent strong performance in their share prices and positive financial results. But with such a strong uptrend seen in the last three years, questions over the sustainability of this good run begin to surface. Apple Inc\\u2019s main chip supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co last week lowered its second-quarter revenue guidance on softer smartphone demand and uncertainty over the cryptocurrency mining market, leading to a decline in the share prices of semiconductor players. It is worth noting that semiconductor-related players on Bursa were one of the main ones that hit new highs in the last one year \\u2014 most of them early this year or late last year. As of last Friday, however, semiconductor players had fallen by an average 26.3% from their record highs, which is significant considering that the new highs were only achieved in the last one year. Other than semiconductors, consumer plays such as Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd, Dutch Lady Milk Industries Bhd, Ajinomoto (Malaysia) Bhd and breweries such as Heineken Malaysia Bhd and Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd have all fallen from their record highs by about 9%-10%. It is worth noting that most of these recent highs were recorded in the first quarter this year. While most of these companies are resilient in terms of earnings, they were traded at expensive levels compared to their peers and historical valuation. Exporters are also expected to see some pressure on their earnings with the stronger ringgit, which has strengthened by 12.8% from a year ago to 3.8977 against the US dollar. As for the FBM KLCI component stocks, while it remains the second best performing index in Southeast Asia so far this year, valuation has become more expensive with its trailing price-earnings ratio (PER) at 17.8 times, which is slightly higher than its five-year average PER of 17.2 times."}, "74": {"date_posted": "9/4/2018", "title": "BN expecting to win viewed as positive for market, says analyst", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (April 9): CIMB IB Research expects the local stock market to remain volatile during the campaigning period and make a defensive stand on top of picks such as Axiata, Dialog and Westports.\\u00a0 In a strategy note today, the research house said the US-China trade war tensions is the reason for the volatility.\\u00a0 Furthermore, it viewed the sectors that are potential winners from Barisan Nasional\\u2019s (BN) general election 14 (GE14) manifesto to include the consumer and construction sectors. \\u00a0 In a report today, CIMB Research said it believes the market is expecting the ruling coalition \\u2014 BN \\u2014 to win with a comfortable majority of Parliament seats.\\u00a0 \\u201cBN currently has 133 out of 222 seats in the House of Parliament.

Technically, the FBM KLCI has fallen below the short-term 30-day moving average and this indicates that the trend has turned slightly bearish in the short term. However, in the intermediate and long term, the index is still above the 200-day moving average and the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. Momentum indicators like the Relative Strength Index and Momentum Oscillator continue to decline and are trading at their mid-levels. Furthermore, the index also has fallen below the middle band and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator continues to decline. Therefore, the technical indicators indicate that the FBM KLCI is currently in a bullish trend correction. The support level for the bullish trend is at 1,800 points and as long as it can stay above this level, the trend may continue to be bullish. Well, when will the trend turn bullish? The indication would be when the FBM KLCI can break above the resistance level of 1,870 points. If this happens, we will be looking at the index climbing to historical highs.

Last Thursday, the telecommunications group reported an 80.4% year-on-year (y-o-y) jump in net profit to RM909.48 million, while revenue rose 13.2% y-o-y to a record RM24.4 billion in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY17). The stock currently trades at 55 times its earnings over the trailing 12 months. That compares to a price-earnings ratio (PER) of 88 times before the latest earnings announcement. However, Axiata\\u2019s stock remains pricey relative to its regional peers such as Singapore Telecommunications Ltd, whose shares were trading at 9.79 times at last Friday\\u2019s closing. Its local rival Maxis Bhd was trading at 21 times to its earnings, while DiGi.Com Bhd has a PER of 25.8 times. JF Apex Securities Bhd analyst Lee Cherng Wee said although Axiata is more expensive than its regional peers, the prospects of Axiata are promising through its subsidiaries Celcom Axiata Bhd and PT XL Axiata Tbk. Celcom and XL are the two largest contributors to Axiata\\u2019s revenue, accounting for 27% and 30.2% respectively in FY17. Lee thinks the growth momentum in its subsidiaries Celcom and XL will continue in FY18 as their ongoing cost efficiency improvement programme was reflected in the FY17 results. Still, analysts aren\\u2019t getting too excited about Axiata\\u2019s performance in FY18. Lee is of the view that FY18 would still be challenging for Axiata due to regulatory risk in its operating companies (Opcos) in various different markets and ongoing price war, especially in Indonesia. While its president and group chief executive officer Tan Sri Jamaludin Ibrahim noted that the group improved by \\u201cleaps and bounds\\u201d in FY17 compared with FY16, he said Axiata is \\u201cstill not there yet\\u201d. At the group\\u2019s fourth quarter of FY17 (4QFY17) media briefing last week, Jamaludin pointed out that even though Celcom\\u2019s and XL\\u2019s turnaround plans are on track, their recoveries have not completed so far. The group has set key performance indicators (KPIs) for FY18 of a 6.3% revenue growth, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation growth of 5.8%, up to 5.5% return on invested capital, 5% return on capital employed and capital expenditure of RM7.4 billion. Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) Research analyst Tan J Young is of the view that the KPIs for FY18 are \\u201cnot so exciting\\u201d. \\u201cResults-wise, it was okay [for FY17]. However, Axiata\\u2019s Indian associate Idea Cellular Ltd was a drag on the group\\u2019s earnings and will continue to be so in the near term. \\u201cManagement guidance for FY18 was not so exciting. We prefer to wait and see for now [as] we need to see more recoveries from Celcom and XL,\\u201d Tan told The Edge Financial Daily over the phone. He has a \\u201chold\\u201d call on Axiata, with a target price of RM5.01. Bloomberg data showed that out of the 27 analysts covering Axiata, 16 have issued \\u201chold\\u201d recommendations on the stock, two have \\u201csell\\u201d calls and nine have \\u201cbuy\\u201d ratings. Their target prices range from RM4 to RM6.50. The counter closed two sen or 0.35% lower at RM5.65 last Friday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM51.12 billion. An analyst who declined to be named said Celcom\\u2019s recent reduction in cost was also in line with lower subscriber base. \\u201cWhen you have fewer subscribers, naturally cost would be lower as well, in terms of customer service and direct costs,\\u201d he added. \\u201cThe Malaysian market is somewhat mature now, Axiata\\u2019s future growth has to be driven by its venture in emerging markets. For example, [its 83.32%-owned] Dialog Axiata PLC reported strong growth in FY17, Opcos like this, except for investment in India, are yielding results,\\u201d the analyst added. Lee, who has a \\u201chold\\u201d call on Axiata with a target price of RM5.20, said the group\\u2019s intention to seek growth by investing into fixed wireless broadband this year may be challenging. \\u201cIt will have to start small as it has cleared the air that there will not be a merger with Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM). Likewise, TM\\u2019s Unifi Mobile will face difficulties growing [fast]. A merger would have been a short cut for both companies, but it is a complex matter,\\u201d he said. Lee was referring to Jamaludin\\u2019s remarks on Thursday that there was no re-merger talks ongoing between Axiata and TM despite the potential synergies. Rather, both companies will undertake usual business collaboration to leverage on their respective strengths, he said. HLIB Research\\u2019s Tan said over the long run, it is still better for both parties to merge as Malaysian market is too crowded. \\u201cIn the long run, we think it is still better to merge Axiata\\u2019s domestic opco, which is Celcom, with TM, because they will eventually step into each other\\u2019s field. An entire merger between TM and Axiata may not as synergistic,\\u201d he said. \\u201cMalaysia market is still crowded to me, taking into account of TM\\u2019s Unifi Mobile, we have five major ones, plus the other mobile virtual network operators, it is too many for our population of 31 million people.

Immediate resistance is at 1,850 points based on the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the bearish trend that started in early February. Technically, the FBM KLCI is bullish above both the short- and long-term 30- and 200-day moving averages. Furthermore, the index is above the Ichimoku Cloud indicator which is expanding upwards. However, the bullish trend can only continue if the technical resistance level at 1,850 points can be broken. Momentum indicators are mixed. The Relative Strength Index and oscillator indicators have climbed above their mid-levels and this indicates that the sentiment has turned bullish. However, the moving average convergence divergence indicator is still declining below its moving average. Furthermore, the Bollinger Bands indicator is narrowing. The FBM KLCI rebounded last week but to continue its bullish trend, the index has to overcome the technical resistance level at 1,850 points. A breakout above this level could bring the index to test the historical high at 1,890 points.

The excitement is set to continue for Bursa Malaysia ahead of the 14th general election (GE14), with the local market showing first signs of the much-anticipated pre-election rally since Jan 3. \\u201cThe market has been on a strong upward trend amid the recovering ringgit and stronger oil price. Talk of a pre-election rally has resurfaced among investors, as well as in the media. While we see some profit-taking activities as we approach the end of our second week of trading, we believe the weakness in the market presents a good buying opportunity for investors and traders,\\u201d Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd head of research Kenny Yee told The Edge Financial Daily. \\u201cWe think that the high spirits leading to the elections, as well as the euphoria in the stock market seen in the developed markets will fuel the momentum in the domestic stock market,\\u201d he added. Echoing the same sentiment, TA Securities research head Kaladher Govindan is of the view that the strong run in the benchmark index so far this year is in line with expectations. \\u201cIt was within our expectations if you follow our strategy reports. We expect the FBM KLCI to hit 1,890 points in the first half of 2018 (1H18), especially in the first quarter before retreating in 2H18,\\u201d Kaladher said via email. In its annual strategy report published on Dec 8 last year, TA Securities wrote that expectations of a GE14 rally should propel the FBM KLCI higher in 1H18, premised on the assumption the elections will be held in March or April this year. However, Kaladher highlighted a possible correction in the market in 1H18. \\u201cA Barisan Nasional victory could hold up on the market momentarily, but we reckon the FBM KLCI could be due for a correction in 2H18 as concerns over the US monetary tightening and ringgit weakness reverberate across the market and translate into heavy foreign selling and a risk-averse strategy among investors,\\u201d he added. However, Kaladher noted that the downside pressure can emerge sooner in 1H18 if the current ruling coalition\\u2019s power base crumbles after the elections. Affin Hwang Asset Management is also optimistic about a better year in 2018 and expects the FBM KLCI to see a 6% to 8% upside, tracking market earnings growth. \\u201cAnalysts are starting the year with a projection of 9% to 10% [growth]. The expectation is that the stronger ringgit will lead to margin expansion [as opposed to contraction] for domestic-oriented companies,\\u201d its senior associate director of equities Cheryl Pola said. The FBM KLCI has climbed 8.6% over the past year. However, CIMB Investment Bank head of Malaysia research Ivy Ng believes the market still has legs to run, maintaining an end-2018 FBM KLCI target of 1,880 points. The local market ended the week on a positive note last week, with the FBM KLCI closing 5.79 points or 0.32% higher at 1,822.67. Market breadth was positive with 643 gainers versus 389 losers. Taking a look at the 30 constituents of the FBM KLCI, the best-performing stock so far is Sime Darby Bhd. The counter climbed 22.2% year to date (YTD) to close at RM2.70 last Friday. This was followed by Petronas Gas Bhd and YTL Corp Bhd, with gains of 8.7% and 8% respectively. Six of the FBM KLCI component stocks were on a downtrend, with KLCCP Stapled Group emerging as the worst performer YTD, falling 9.1% to close unchanged at RM7.85 last Friday. Apart from Axiata Group Bhd, the telecommunication sector has turned out to be a laggard YTD, with shares in DiGi.Com Bhd and Telekom Malaysia Bhd declining by 7.8% and 4.8% respectively. Maxis Bhd remained unchanged at RM6.01 last Friday. Sime Darby Plantation Bhd saw its share price fall 7.8% YTD to close at RM5.53 last Friday \\u2014 moving in the opposite direction of Sime Darby. Despite a strong start to the year, the FBM KLCI is still underperforming its regional peers and developed markets. The Edge Financial Daily has spoken to several heads of research on some of the potential stocks they see among the component stocks that could run higher on the back of the positive sentiment in the global equity market, recovering oil prices and the ringgit, as well as the boost from the upcoming GE14. 1) Tenaga Nasional Bhd\\u00a0 A screaming buy among analysts, Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) rose 3.4% in the first two weeks of the year. Most analysts continue to favour TNB as Bloomberg data shows that 20 out of 25 analysts that cover the stock have a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call. According to Rakuten Trade\\u2019s Yee, the utility company\\u2019s valuation is undemanding and provides decent dividend yield. At its closing price of RM15.78 last Friday, TNB is trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio (PER) of 12.9 times and has a dividend yield of about 3.9%. TNB is also CIMB\\u2019s top three big caps for 2018 as Ng sees the stock offer a resilient organic earnings growth potential. According to her, it is building four new power plants in Malaysia, which could raise its generation earnings in 2017 to 2020. She also pointed out that stronger earnings driven by the new assets TNB acquired in the past year are another potential rerating catalyst. TA Securities, which has a target price (TP) of RM17.38 for TNB, indicating a potential return of about 10%, has also picked the utility company as one of its top picks. TA Securities analyst Kylie Chan Sze Zan said in an annual strategy report that TNB is attractive on most valuation metrics, including a 10.9 times forward PER, which is one standard deviation below historical average, 7.1 times forward enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, which is an 18% discount to regional peers. Based on Bloomberg\\u2019s consensus data, the 12-month TP for TNB is at RM16.61, indicating a potential return of 5.3%. TNB was also one of the stocks that featured on The Edge Financial Daily\\u2019s Top 10 Picks for 2018. 2) Axiata Group Bhd\\u00a0 Axiata Group Bhd is expected to perform in 2018 as the telecommunication company is expected to see an improvement in its earnings after witnessing four consecutive years of earnings contraction at its operating companies \\u2014 Celcom Axiata Bhd and Indonesia\\u2019s PT XL Axiata Tbk. The turnaround appears to be expected by the market as seen by the gain of 1.1% in the first 10 trading days of 2018. This was in contrast to its share price performance in the last three years where it fell by about 14.6%. According to CIMB\\u2019s Ng, Axiata\\u2019s core earnings per share is expected to rebound by a strong 29% and 50% for its forecast for financial years ending Dec 31, 2018 and 2019 respectively due to much higher contributions from XL, net profit break-even for Airtel Bangladesh Ltd by end-2018 and cessation in equity accounting for Idea\\u2019s losses post-merger with Vodafone. Rakuten\\u2019s Yee concurred, noting that Axiata\\u2019s digital transformation is expected to bring an improvement to its earnings. \\u201cOther than that, the news flow of a potential initial public offering of its tower unit, edotco Group Sdn Bhd, this year is also another catalyst for Axiata,\\u201d he said. 3) Banking sector \\u2014\\u00a0CIMB, Maybank Affin Hwang Asset Management\\u2019s Pola is of the view that banks are among those that could do well in 2018. \\u201cThis year has been about improvement in asset quality. In 2018, we should see stronger pre-provision growth, especially if interest rates rise, which will lead to net interest margin expansion [but to a lesser extent compared to its Singapore counterparts],\\u201d she said. She added that loan growth should be slightly stronger after the disappointing 2017. Pola, however, noted that there is still an overhang on the sector as the impact of Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards 9 (MFRS9) has yet to be fully known but if the impact on provisions or book values is low as expected, it would clear another uncertainty that remains for the banking sector. \\u201cOur top picks are CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (inexpensive valuations) and Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) (possibility of capital management after MFRS9, better cash dividends, the possible listing of Etiqa). Hong Leong Bank Bhd has impressive fundamentals but valuations are a bit stretched,\\u201d she added. Similar to Pola, Rakuten\\u2019s Yee highlighted that both CIMB and Maybank could be proxy for foreign buying into the banking sector. \\u201cMaybank is also a defensive play with its relatively high dividend yield of over 5%,\\u201d he added. TA Securities also picked CIMB as one of its top picks for 2018 in its annual strategy report. Its analyst Wong Li Hsia said CIMB has been outpacing its peers in terms of yearly profit growth since the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2015. She also pointed that better prospects in CIMB Niaga and CIMB Thai as one of the investment themes that will drive CIMB. \\u201cCredit charges have eased. While we forecast the overall credit charge to remain elevated, we believe the worst \\u2014 in terms of asset quality may be over, led by further recoveries in its overseas operations,\\u201d Wong said. CIMB\\u2019s share price gained 3.7% YTD to close at RM6.78 last Friday, while Maybank\\u2019s share price edged higher by 0.5% to RM9.85. 4. Petronas Gas Bhd The selldown at the end of last year created a value proportion for those who are interested in investing in Petronas Gas Bhd (PetGas). The share price fell by 4.8% compared with three years ago to its closing price of RM19.00 last Friday. PetGas\\u2019 share price fell to its low of RM15.88 in November last year compared with its three-year peak of RM22.02 in October 2015. Yee believes that the selldown was overdone and was mainly due to third-party access framework concern. While the market has recovered by 19.6% from its low since then, PetGas is still trading at about 4.9% below its three-year average price of RM19.93.\n\\u00a0"}, "92": {"date_posted": "15/1/2018", "title": "KLCI to start week on positive note, ringgit and crude oil to stay in focus", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 15): The FBM KLCI is expected to start the week on a positive note with the ringgit and crude oil prices to stay in focus.

As for loan growth in 2018, CIMB is looking at a higher range of 4% to 5% for the banking sector as a whole compared with 2017. Annualised loan growth for the banking sector came in at 3.3% for the first 11 months of 2017. \\u201cWe will only reveal CIMB\\u2019s targets for loan growth at the end of February when we announce our results.

He answered in the affirmative when asked if the robust gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2017, which averaged at 5.9% for the first three quarters, would translate into better loan growth in 2018. \\u201cGDP growth last year was above expectations which is positive, and we believe this will translate into stronger loan growth for 2018 compared with 2017. Last year\\u2019s loan growth was low due to corporates but this year we foresee that loan growth from corporates would be stronger,\\u201d he said. Most economists are expecting a hike in the overnight policy rate (OPR) by 25 basis points in 2018, which would make loans more expensive.

Also the [general] election has to happen this year so that the overhang issue would be over, hence we do see an upside in corporate investment activities which hopefully translates into fundraising from both loans and also capital markets,\\u201d he said.

In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, Axiata said Tajudin filed the application against the Court of Appeal's decision on Nov 29 this year, which dismissed Tajudin\\u2019s first appeal with costs of RM15,000 to be paid by Tajudin to Rego. Rego was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Technology Resources Industries Bhd (TRI), which is now known as Celcom Resources Bhd. As Celcom Trading, it is now wholly-owned by Celcom Resources, which is in turn owned by Celcom Axiata Bhd, Axiata's telco arm in Malaysia. The lawsuit began with Rego claiming against Tajuddin for amounts due to Rego, following Rego's investment agreement entered in Jan 10, 1997 (and a supplemental agreement on April 21 that same year) with Aras Capital Sdn Bhd, for which an indemnity letter was issued by Tajuddin to Rego, TRI, and its directors on April 1, 1998. In his defence and counterclaim, Tajudin had sought a court declaration that the indemnity letter given to Rego relating to investments made by Rego under the two agreements is void or alternatively, was made void, to revoke the letter of indemnity and return the sum of RM100 million allegedly paid by Tajudin to Rego and damages arising from the claim. In June last year, the High Court has allowed Rego\\u2019s claim of RM264.53 million, with interest of 5% from May 31, 2013 against Aras Capital and Tajudin.

It is learnt that PUC will introduce the unconventional services to the market in phases next year. All details and the targeted timeline for each phase will be revealed at the mid-December launch. Another source highlights that e-wallet is a lucrative area of growth in the modern economy and, hence, PUC\\u2019s scheme will promote customer-to-customer (C2C) payments to shoppers. \\u201cMoving forward, PUC may even promote more financial services to shoppers. It will enable C2C payments based on convenience-centric lifestyle activities such as seamless dining bill-splitting,\\u201d he says. PUC is also exploring services that will bridge the gap between shoppers and convenient financial services. However, all these are subject to obtaining the necessary licences from the authorities. PUC, formerly known as PUC Founder (MSC) Bhd, is an ACE Market-listed information technology solutions provider that is also involved in renewable energy, media and advertising as well as e-payment processing services. To recap, in early September, PUC obtained conditional approval as an e-money issuer from Bank Negara Malaysia. The group also has two subsidiaries with moneylending licences. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia on Sept 7, PUC announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, EPP Solution Sdn Bhd, had been given approval to issue e-money within a year. EPP Solution \\u2014 also a registered business with Bank Negara for merchant acquiring services \\u2014 will be joining a list of at least 25 non-bank entities that have been given approval to issue e-money via their mobile apps. Other players include AEON Credit Service (M) Bhd, Alipay Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Axiata Digital eCode Sdn Bhd, ManagePay Services Sdn Bhd, PayPal Pte Ltd, Touch \\u2019n Go Sdn Bhd and XOX Com Sdn Bhd. Five banks, namely AmBank (M) Bhd, Bank of China (M) Bhd, CIMB Bank Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd and RHB Bank Bhd, have also received the green light from the central bank to become e-money issuers. For perspective, there are two types of e-money schemes \\u2014 the small scheme and the large scheme \\u2014 which are determined by the purse size and the outstanding e-money liabilities. PUC said in the Sept 7 announcement that it has obtained approval from Bank Negara to issue e-money under the large scheme, which refers to a maximum purse limit of RM1,500. In comparison, the small scheme only allows a maximum purse limit of RM200. It is worth noting that PUC recently embarked on a few exclusive collaborations with some start-ups, paving the way for the company to build its e-wallet business. Last month, PUC announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Founder Qube Sdn Bhd (FQ), has signed a memorandum of understanding with Hong Kong-based Advwhere Ltd for a collaboration, where FQ will be appointed with the exclusive right to sell Cloudbreakr digital advertisement placement solutions across Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. PUC is also teaming up with point-of-sale services provider Bersian Technology (M) Sdn Bhd to implement a cross-marketing collaboration. In June, PUC signed an exclusive partnership agreement with Laputa Ventures Sdn Bhd to use the latter\\u2019s advertising platform, dubbed Moola, to offer on-vehicle advertising. \\u00a0 Variation to utilisation of proceeds While PUC has obtained approval as an e-money issuer and identified its partners, it needs the funds to launch the service. It has said RM36.45 million had been allocated for the rolling out of the e-money scheme. Interestingly, the money will be coming from the RM42.65 million raised from a rights issue of irredeemable convertible unsecured loan stocks (ICULS) in February last year. PUC is in the process of obtaining clearance from the relevant regulators to vary the utilisation of the proceeds. \\u201cPUC has submitted its request to Securities Commission Malaysia. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the company should be able to call an extraordinary general meeting as early as December to get shareholders\\u2019 approval,\\u201d says a source familiar with the company. To recap, The Edge in April reported that PUC had net cash of RM43.3 million, RM42.65 million of which it cannot use for any purpose other than to expand its renewable energy business. In October 2015, PUC proposed the issuance of ICULS with warrants to raise up to RM83.9 million, but only managed to get RM42.65 million to fund its solar expansion programme. In February last year, Jack Cheong Chia Chieh, the chief of PUC, died of a sudden illness at the age of 44. Market observers have pointed out that his brother and successor, Cheong Chia Chou, who was appointed the new managing director last December, is not keen on the renewable energy business that was started by the late Chia Chieh. Instead, he is more interested in developing the company\\u2019s IT business. Under the feed-in-tariff programme, PUC currently operates a 1mw capacity solar photovoltaic power plant in Sungai Petani, Kedah. The output will be supplied to Tenaga Nasional Bhd at a fixed rate. To date, however, PUC has yet to be awarded any new project despite efforts to apply for quota with the Sustainable Energy Development Authority of Malaysia and Energy Commission. Year to date, shares of PUC have risen 223%. The stock closed at 21 sen last Thursday, giving the company a market capitalisation of RM284 million. \\u00a0"}, "99": {"date_posted": "29/11/2017", "title": "TNB among top 3 Bursa gainers as shares hit 2-year intraday high of RM15.48", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 29): Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) shares hit an intraday high of RM15.48 today, after rising 50 sen or 3.3% from its last closing market price of RM14.98 yesterday.

The trade-reliant economy's September export data is due on Tuesday, with analysts polled by Reuters expecting a fifth consecutive month of rise in non-oil domestic exports. \"Singapore reported very strong economic growth, and overall sentiment in the global economy is on a sustainable pace, attributed to the inflation on the US side,\" said Colin Tan, an analyst from KGI Securities. In the United States, soaring gasoline prices helped consumer prices in September grow the most in eight months, but underlying inflation remained muted. The persistent modest readings in the core CPI are likely to worry Federal Reserve officials who have been engaged in a vigorous debate on the inflation path.

Companies (excluding banks) that compose local benchmark the FBM KLCI saw their aggregate net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) rise 149% to 1.37 times as at Aug 28 from 0.55 times five years ago. In the same period, their earnings per share (EPS) remained relatively flat \\u2014 it stood at 105.73 sen per share as at last Tuesday. If a corporation takes advantage of leverage to grow its business, earnings growth should outpace rising debt but this has not been the case in the last couple of years, Areca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong tells The Edge. \\u201cWhat we have seen in the last couple of years is that companies are borrowing due to cash flow problems as opposed to growing their business. A lot of them are facing problems in collecting payments from sales. There has been a rise in receivables, thus\\u00a0 leading to poor cash flow for companies, eventually contributing to an increase in debt. The addition of borrowing costs has impacted the bottom lines of companies as well,\\u201d he explains. This is reflected in RAM Credit Information Sdn Bhd\\u2019s (RAMCI) report, which shows that the average debt repayment trend of industries crept up to 70 days in the second quarter of this year compared with 66 days in the first quarter. In other words, corporations in Malaysia are taking a longer time to repay their debt. Nonetheless, RAMCI CEO Dawn Lai thinks the trend could be merely cyclical. \\u201cSome sectors have seen an improvement in payment speed while others have seen a slowing down. It could be cyclical. We would need to watch the trend for a few more quarters,\\u201d she says via email. Apart from the companies on the FBM KLCI, the total net debt of those listed on Bursa, excluding banks and newly listed entities, also rose \\u2014 by 81.4% from 2012 to RM295.7 billion \\u2014 based on their latest filings. In the same period, revenue grew 18.9% to RM981.9 billion while net income edged up 0.98% to RM97.5 billion. Tenaga Nasional Bhd recorded the highest net debt of RM26.3 billion among all the listed companies in the country, based on its latest filings. This represents an increase of 66.3% from 2012. By comparison, its latest 12-month revenue and net profit grew 28.9% and 57.5% from 2012 to RM46.2 billion and RM6.95 billion respectively. It is even more worrying that some of the companies have seen a decline in net profit while net debt rose. Of the top 20 companies with the highest net debt, more than half have seen their bottom lines shrink from five years ago, based on their latest results. Those with the biggest fall in net income are Bumi Armada Bhd, Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, IOI Corp Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd and Sapura Energy Bhd. Bumi Armada, which is involved in the oil and gas industry, slipped into the red, suffering a loss of RM1.2 billion, based on its latest 12-month performance. This is despite its net debt ballooning by 387.1% from 2012 to RM10.6 billion now. Sapura Energy, another oil and gas player, also saw its net profit fall, by 55.4% from 2012 to RM125.5 million, despite an increase of 21 times in its net debt to RM14.8 billion, according to its latest filing with Bursa. Moody\\u2019s Investors Service agrees that the earnings of Malaysian firms have not grown as much as their borrowings, pointing to the rise in their debt-to-Ebitda ratio to 4.1 times last year from 2.4 times in 2007. Moody\\u2019s senior credit officer and vice-president Eugene Tarzimanov, however, says this trend is similar to the rapid build-up in non-financial corporate debt the world over after the 2007/08 global financial crisis. \\u201cInterestingly, the share of corporate debt owed by weak firms, those with interest coverage ratios or ICRs (Ebitda-to-interest expense ratio) of below 1, increased only marginally to 7% in 2016 from 6% in 2007 as interest rates remain relatively low in Malaysia, particularly after the overnight policy rate (OPR) cut last year,\\u201d he adds. Bank Negara Malaysia cut the OPR by 25 basis points to 3% in July last year due to rising risks from the Brexit vote in Europe. It was the central bank\\u2019s first cut in seven years. Looking at all the listed companies in Malaysia, Tarzimanov considers the health of the Malaysian corporate sector as broadly good but observes some weaknesses in commodity-related industries (oil and gas, transport, marine and mining) and import-dependent industries (such as automotive). In terms of corporate debt level relative to gross domestic product (GDP), Malaysia is better off than many other Asian economies, according to Tarzimanov. \\u201cMalaysia\\u2019s ratio stands at around 70% based on BIS (Bank for International Settlements) data, lower than that of Australia, Singapore, Vietnam and China. Malaysia\\u2019s corporate debt-to-GDP ratio, however, is a bit higher than that of Thailand, India, Indonesia and the Philippines (all below 50%),\\u201d he says. Nonetheless, the gearing ratio (debt-to-equity ratio) in Malaysia deteriorated to 70% last year from 60% in 2015, indicating that companies have more debt in their capital structure. Tarzimanov says Malaysia is about average compared with the rest of Asia on this measure. \\u00a0 Increase in debt level normal A fund manager who requested anonymity considers the increase in the debt level of Malaysian listed companies as normal because most of them are taking advantage of the global low interest rate environment. He attributes the slower pace in earnings growth compared with net debt partly to the collapse in oil prices in the last two to three years. \\u201cIf you look at Malaysia, we are a commodity-driven economy. There are quite a lot of oil and gas-related companies on the FBM KLCI as well as Bursa. These companies have seen a decline in their earnings and a rise in borrowings in order to manage cash flow. \\u201cIt\\u2019s also a process, I believe. Some of the borrowings were made to invest in long-term projects. Look at Ekovest. The company has a lot of projects in the pipeline but earnings will take a longer time to materialise. Still, most of them would generate sustainable long-term earnings,\\u201d he says. Ekovest\\u2019s net debt jumped 103 times from 2012 to RM1.88 billion, its latest filings show. Revenue and net profit in the last 12 months grew 407.9% and 214.4% from 2012 to RM1.06 billion and RM228.4 million respectively. The fund manager notes that on average, the ICRs of companies listed on Bursa remain at very comfortable levels. Bloomberg data shows that the aggregate Ebitda-to-interest expense ratio for Malaysian listed companies stood at 5.8 times as at Aug 29, slipping slightly from 6.1 times in 2012. \\u00a0 \\u00a0"}, "110": {"date_posted": "13/9/2017", "title": "Axiata\\u2019s Sri Lankan arm acquires stake in CTF for RM29.49m", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: Axiata Group Bhd\\u2019s 83.32%-owned subsidiary, Dialog Axiata PLC, has acquired an 80.34% stake in Colombo Trust Finance PLC (CTF) for RM29.49 million in order to expand its digital financial services.

They collectively commanded a market capitalisation of RM1.59 trillion, or 90.3% of the entire market value as at that day, up 5.2% from RM1.51 trillion last year, after falling for two consecutive years. The gain in the collective value of the BRC companies \\u2014 those with a market capitalisation of at least RM1 billion as at end-March \\u2014 happened even as the FBM KLCI regained ground and closed above 1,700 points again in March. Before that, the ringgit\\u2019s decline to levels last seen during the 1998 Asian financial crisis and the market volatility following the outflow of foreign funds from emerging markets after the US presidential election, nudged the FBM KLCI 3% lower year on year in 2016 to 1,641.73 points. It marked a third straight year of decline after skidding 3.9% in 2015 and 5.7% in 2014. Before that, the local benchmark had risen for five consecutive years, from 876.75 points at end-2008 to 1,866.96 points by end-2013. By June 30 this year, the 184 BRC members\\u2019 combined market capitalisation had increased further (from end-March) to RM1.61 trillion, led by gains at Malayan Banking Bhd and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, which each gained more than RM10 billion in market cap in the second quarter. In June this year, Maybank became the first Malaysia-listed company with a market cap of more than RM100 billion. The significant change in stock prices between end-March and end-June is why The Edge decided to change the cut-off date in tabulating total returns to shareholders from end-March to end-June, closer to the BRC gala dinner and awards. The membership cut-off date was kept at end-March to give enough time to compile data for tabulation as well as for the panel of corporate responsibility (CR) judges to review the companies. Because of this, two large IPOs did not make it to our list this year: Eco World International Bhd, which listed on April 3, and Lotte Chemical Titan Holdings Bhd, listed on July 11. They will only be included for membership next year. The 184 BRC 2017 members continue to be major taxpayers, paying an estimated RM30.9 billion in taxes in FY2016 compared with RM29.8 billion in FY2015 and RM30.7 billion in FY2014. The taxes paid for FY2016 made up about 27% of the \\u201cmore than RM114 billion\\u201d in direct taxes the Inland Revenue Board reportedly collected last year. The IRB collected RM116.8 billion in direct taxes in 2015, RM127 billion in 2014 and RM121 billion in 2013. The taxman reportedly aims to collect RM127 billion in direct taxes this year. The higher combined tax haul came even as the combined revenue of the 184 BRC 2017 members reached RM747.1 billion in FY2016, up 2.8% from RM726.8 billion in the previous financial year. Nonetheless, the bottom line was lower, with BRC members posting a collective pre-tax profit of RM112.5 billion in FY2016 compared with RM115.3 billion in FY2015. Collective net profit was RM81.6 billion in FY2016 compared with RM85.4 billion in FY2015, RM87.8 billion in FY2014 and RM85.5 billion in FY2013. Collective FY2016 earnings were weighed down by sizeable losses at several oil and gas as well as industrial and services companies, including UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd, UMW Holdings Bhd, Bumi Armada Bhd and DRB-Hicom Bhd. A quick sectoral analysis of this year\\u2019s 184 BRC members reveals that the collectively higher turnover was lifted by significant gains in the plantation sector. All other sectors also gained in terms of top line, except for consumer products. Planters also led gains in terms of pre-tax and net profits for FY2016. The FY2016 net profit of the nine Super Big Cap companies \\u2014 those with a market capitalisation of at least RM40 billion \\u2014 were largely unchanged year on year, although their combined turnover was up 4%. On the other hand, the 29 Big Cap companies \\u2014 with a market capitalisation of RM10 billion to RM40 billion \\u2014 saw a 1% decline in combined turnover but an 8% rise in profit before tax and 7% gain in collective net profit. The 146 BRC 2017 members with RM1 billion to RM10 billion in market cap, meanwhile, saw a 5% rise in turnover for FY2016 but 17% lower pre-tax profit and a 27% fall in net profit collectively.

There are 184 members in the club this year. As recognition is the best reward for accomplishments, it is The Edge\\u2019s hope that the awards continue to encourage more companies to strive even harder for excellence. \\u00a0 THE AWARDS \\u00a0 The 12 CATEGORIES are: \\u00a0 THE EDGE BRC SECTORAL CORPORATE AWARDS To be eligible for the corporate awards, a BRC member must have been listed at least four calendar years before the end-March cut-off date in the current year as companies are evaluated on their financial performance over three years. The methodology for the corporate awards is both stringent and transparent, with the results audited by Deloitte Malaysia The data used in determining the companies that qualify for The Edge BRC membership and winners of The Edge BRC Corporate Awards is provided by Asia Analytica Data Sdn Bhd (formerly known as The Edge Markets Sdn Bhd) and data extracted from Bloomberg. Members eligible for the Highest Return on Equity Over Three Years and Highest Growth in Profit After Tax Over Three Years awards must be profitable every year throughout the evaluation period. For this year, the evaluation period is between FY2013 and FY2016. Calculation for PAT growth is also subject to a risk-weight factor component to recognise the importance of consistency in profit delivery throughout the evaluation period. Winners for The Edge BRC Highest Returns to Shareholders award are judged purely based on total return, consisting of share price gains and dividends over a three-year period. This year, the cut-off date is changed from March 31 to June 30 so that the market data is closer to the BRC gala dinner. The June 30 cut-off date will be maintained going forward, with this year being the \\u201cgap\\u201d year when the data is for three years and three months (March 31, 2014, to June 30, 2017). The annual end-March cut-off date for BRC membership is unchanged due to the need to source CR information for the judges\\u2019 consideration. Companies with scores within 0.5point of each other are deemed to be of the same rank in determining the recipients of both gold and silver awards. There could, therefore, be cases of joint recipients for gold and silver awards. \\u00a0 THE EDGE BRC BEST CR INITIATIVES AWARD Eligible companies are evaluated by a panel of judges on their CR initiatives. The Edge BRC Best CR Initiatives award is presented to companies with the top average scores in three categories: the Super Big Cap category (companies with over RM40 billion in market capitalisation), the Big Cap category (companies with RM10 billion to RM40 billion in market capitalisation) and companies with less than RM10 billion market capitalisation. The panel is selected by The Edge and the evaluation criteria are based on the three focal areas spelt out by Bursa Malaysia\\u2019s Sustainability Reporting Guide for Public Listed Companies \\u2014 economic, social and environmental. CR scores account for 30% of the evaluation for The Edge BRC Company of the Year award. THE EDGE BRC COMPANY OF THE YEAR AWARD \\u00a0 VALUE CREATOR: OUTSTANDING CEO OF MALAYSIA The winner(s) of this award is determined by The Edge based on an assessment of the person\\u2019s contribution to value creation for his/her company. Here, value creation is reflected in the company\\u2019s market valuation, return to shareholders and stakeholders, revenue and profit growth as well as employment creation. To be chosen, the CEO must have achieved outstanding success in all these areas. Assessment starts from when the person became CEO of the company. The Edge has absolute discretion in deciding on this exclusive award and can choose not to name a winner \\u2014 as was the case in 2011 and 2015. In 2010, the award went to Tan Sri Teh Hong Piow and Datuk Seri Nazir Razak for their outstanding contribution to their respective banking groups, Public Bank Bhd and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. In 2012, the recipients were AmBank Group founder and chairman Tan Sri Azman Hashim and AirAsia Bhd co-founder and group CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes. Azman remains a financier for all seasons while Fernandes won for his role in transforming Asia\\u2019s aviation industry. In 2013, the award went to Minister in the Prime Minister\\u2019s Department Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar and Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin, former president and CEO of S P Setia Bhd. Abdul Wahid was recognised for his leadership during his tenure as CEO of Renong Bhd (2001 to 2004), Telekom Malaysia Bhd (2004 to 2008) and Malayan Banking Bhd (2008 to 2013) while Liew won for his contribution at S P Setia, a company he left in April 2015 (after about 18 years) for niche developer Eco World Development Holdings Bhd. In 2014, the award went to Sunway Group founder and executive chairman Tan Sri Jeffrey Cheah and Axiata Group Bhd president and group CEO Tan Sri Jamaludin Ibrahim for having shown exemplary leadership in building businesses and creating value for all stakeholders. Last year, the award went to Khazanah Nasional Bhd managing director Tan Sri Azman Mokhtar, who was instrumental in not only transforming the institution but also the collective transformation of 20 government-linked companies across varied industries."}, "116": {"date_posted": "9/8/2017", "title": "KLCI comes under selling pressure in early trade, select blue chips drag ", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 9): The FBM KLCI came under selling pressure in early trade this morning and fell after the market opened.

He adds that while share prices almost doubled or tripled from the bottom, earnings recovery was not as strong, giving investors a rude awakening. According to Pong, the FBM KLCI is trading at forward price-earnings ratio (PER) of about 15.9 times, which is near the benchmark\\u2019s peak valuation. \\u201cThe current valuation is near the highest level seen in 2007. In 2007, the index traded as high as 16.1 times PER,\\u201d he shares.

DiGi.Com Bhd and Maxis Bhd were trading at a trailing PER of 24 and 23 times respectively. A fund manager shares with The Edge that Axiata\\u2019s high trailing PER was due to the weak results last year. \\u201cFY2016 (financial year ended Dec 31, 2016) wasn\\u2019t exactly a good year for Axiata and the big loss of RM309.5 million in the fourth quarter led to a smaller earnings base, which explains the high PER. Nonetheless, if the group is able to maintain and continue that positive trajectory in earnings from the first quarter, it would appear to be trading at a rather reasonable level,\\u201d he says. According to Bloomberg data, out of 29 analysts who track the stock, six have a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call, 20 have \\u201chold\\u201d and the remaining three, \\u201csell\\u201d.

The group, which manufactures micro-electronics and LED components, is currently trading at a trailing PER of 23.3 times. In the last five years, its trailing PER averaged at about 16 times. An analyst says while JHM\\u2019s earnings continue to point towards an upward trend, the magnitude of growth does not match the growth seen in its share price. \\u00a0 Semiconductor players Semiconductor players continue to be the darling of investors, so much so that almost half of those that are linked to Apple Inc\\u2019s iPhone have a higher valuation than Apple Inc itself. On average, some of the semiconductor players have an average trailing PER of 23 times while Apple Inc has a trailing PER of 17.9 times. Alliance-DBS Research Sdn Bhd analyst Toh Woo Kim says the upward momentum seen in Globetronics Technology Bhd\\u2019s share price remains strong, with expectations of better results until 2018, driven by the strong interest in 3D sensor suppliers. \\u201cGlobetronic\\u2019s valuation traded up to 17 to 18 times PER (forward) in 2015 and early 2016 when its 3D imaging sensor was widely expected to be adopted. In the current situation, the adoption of light and gesture sensors is more certain, with potential upside from other sensor products as well,\\u201d Toh says. He adds that other players such as Inari Amertron Bhd have enjoyed multiyear re-ratings due to the adoption of LTE in smartphones and strong relationship with Broadcom. \\u201cA similar trend is expected for Globetronics owing to rising sensor usage in smartphones and the company\\u2019s strong relationship with the Swiss-listed customer.\\u201d Another analyst says the multiyear re-rating for semiconductor players is expected as the Internet of Things era begins. \\u201cIf you believe in the story for IoT, where droids and smarthomes will be part of our everyday lives, the growth potential for the semiconductor players is huge,\\u201d he says. \\u00a0 AirAsia X Bhd Although the group\\u2019s share price dropped about 24.5% in the couple of days after it reported that its net profit plummeted by more than 90% year on year, AirAsia X Bhd still trades at a trailing PER of 29.3 times. In comparison, AirAsia Bhd is trading at a trailing PER of five times. In other words, expectations for AirAsia X to perform is six times higher than that for AirAsia. A fund manager with a local house shares that the high expectation is due to its return to profitability since the last quarter of 2015. \\u201cAfter AirAsia X returned to the black in the last quarter of financial year 2015, the group has shown some steady growth, which has created a hype that it will continue. But with the latest results, this should bring the airline back to reality,\\u201d he says.

In addition, Axiata has also granted Mitsui a call option for US$92.4 million to acquire an additional 10% stake which is exercisable within 12 months of completion of the transaction, which is by the end of May 2017. Should Mitsui exercise the call option, Axiata will continue to hold controlling and majority interests in Smart at 72.5%. The disposal proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and repayment of existing debt. Strategically, the corporate exercise will enable Axiata to tap into Mitsui\\u2019s expertise in digital series and the Internet of things offerings. This will enable Smart to further strengthen its digital leadership in Cambodia. As at Dec 31, 2016, the group\\u2019s net cash holdings amounted to RM16,927.5 million. Assuming that the whole proceeds will be utilised to pare down existing debt, the net cash position will improve by +4.1% to RM16,241.7 million. Despite the exercise being part of Axiata\\u2019s portfolio rebalancing strategy, we view that the positive impact on the disposal to the balance sheet is minimal. For financial year 2016 (FY16), Smart\\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) contribution to Axiata stood at 6.7% or RM538 million. Assuming the exercise took place in FY16, Smart\\u2019s Ebitda contribution would be reduced by 21.6% to RM422 million. This would mean that Smart\\u2019s Ebitda contribution would form 5.3% of the group\\u2019s total Ebitda. As such, the dilution in Ebitda is negligible as well. We are maintaining Axiata\\u2019s TP at RM4.98 per share. This is premised on pegging FY17 Ebitda to 7.5 times enterprise value/Ebitda, which is the group\\u2019s five-year historical average. The performance of the group\\u2019s main operating segments has been under pressure. Our primary concern lies in future prospects for Celcom Axiata Bhd, which is one of the group\\u2019s main Ebitda contributors. This is mainly attributable to the heightened price war among its peers. In addition, with the active merger and acquisition activities the group is currently embarking on,we opine that dividend payout could be capped.

This includes broadband access directly to residential and enterprise premises, and a cellular network backhaul. The deal involves Axiata buying the remaining capacity of Ipstar-1, wholly owned by Thaicom and launched in 2005, to deliver over 1Gbps high throughput satellite (HTS) capacity of broadband to Axiata\\u2019s 66%-owned PT XL Axiata Tbk (XL). HTS connectivity provides coverage in areas where terrestrial-based stations are limited or unavailable, enabling XL to connect remote and under-serviced areas in Indonesia. This is part of XL\\u2019s overall transformation programme, focused on improving 4G adoption rates through increased coverage, modernising distribution channels via partnerships with traditional outlets, and building online video content and data promotions. XL significantly increased its subscriber base by 4.6 million, or 11% year-on-year (y-o-y) in the fourth quarter of financial year 2016 (4QFY16). This stemmed largely from prepaid subscribers that rose 1.4 million quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) to 45.9 million, while postpaid users increased 22,000 q-o-q to 533,000. However, monetisation of rapidly growing data revenues failed to outpace the loss in voice and SMS, which caused XL\\u2019s blended 4QFY16 average revenue per user to fall by 2,000 rupiah (64.88 sen) q-o-q and 8,000 rupiah y-o-y to 34,000 rupiah. Nevertheless, after adjusting for one-off accelerated depreciation, foreign exchange, tax and capital lease gains, XL\\u2019s 4QFY16 core net profit of 41 billion rupiah was a welcome relief following five consecutive quarters of normalised losses. Recall that the stronger XL bottom line stemmed from a 1% increase in tower lease revenue, a 15% reduction in interest charges from its recent rights issue and tower sale, together with a 17% net depreciation reduction (adjusted for accelerated charges).

At 10.01am, the FBM KLCI was down 1.26 points to 1,738.26. The index had earlier clawed higher to 1,740.13. The top losers included Nestle (M) Bhd, HCK Capital Group Bhd, Heineken Malaysia Bhd, Pentamaster Corp Bhd, KLCC Property Holdings Bhd, JHM Consolidation Bhd, Hong Leong Industries Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd, Malaysia Smelting Corp Bhd, Kawan Food Bhd and Axiata Group Bhd.

Global stock markets were pressured on Tuesday as rising tensions in the Middle East and political uncertainty in Europe kept investors on edge, underpinning safe assets such as the yen, gold and Treasuries, according to Reuters. The exception was oil, which continued its steady climb on supply concerns in the wake of the US missile strikes on a Syrian air base last week, and a shutdown at a Libyan oilfield, it said. Hong Leong IB Research said that in the near term, the Dow may continue to lock in a rangebound consolidation mode within 20,400 to 21,000 as investors refocus on the 1Q17 earnings reporting season and geopolitical issues. \"In tandem with the cautious mode overseas, KLCI could be trapped in rangebound consolidation pattern within 1,725\\u20131,760 zones in the short term. \"Also, given the recovering Brent crude oil prices approaching US$56, we may anticipate trading interest to pick up within oil and gas this week,\" it said. \\u00a0"}, "136": {"date_posted": "10/4/2017", "title": "Lead Story: Some indicators looking up, but this has given false hope in the past", "article": " \\u00a0 AS the curtain falls on the first quarter (1Q2017), it is clear that the local stock market is having a party. The benchmark FBM KLCI is up 5.99%, its fastest quarterly expansion since 2013 and its best start to a year since 2007. The return of foreign investors, who were net sellers over the past two years due to a weakened ringgit, is one of the factors that is fuelling the rally. Year to date till March 24, foreign investors have poured a net RM1.378 billion into local stocks, according to data tracked by MIDF Research. The past two years had seen a net outflow of RM19.5 billion in 2015 and RM3 billion last year. However, the FBM KLCI is still lagging behind other emerging markets, slightly underperforming the MSCI Developed Markets Index, which rose 6.21% in 1Q2017. In comparison, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index has expanded twice as fast at 12.43% over the same period. This lag is consistent with the trend over the past 12 months, says AllianceDBS Research head of research Bernard Ching. While improving fundamentals and sustained bullish sentiment will keep the Malaysian market buoyant in the near term, he says the upside to fundamental valuations has narrowed, though not yet stretched. \\u201cAsset prices are likely to overshoot fundamental values in a liquidity driven rally,\\u201d Ching says. \\u201cAs such, investors should look for profit-taking opportunities as and when they arise.\\u201d The emerging question is whether the strong first quarter is signalling a strong year ahead for the FBM KLCI. It began the past two years in green, albeit more moderate, territory but finished in the red, down 3% last year and falling 3.9% in 2015. Thus far, Bursa Malaysia has closed three consecutive years in retreat, although it is still, according to Bloomberg, technically, the world\\u2019s longest bull market at eight years and counting since the last correction over 20% in 2008. Some indicators, such as the ringgit, are looking up, but have proved to be false hope before. The ringgit has regained some lost ground against the greenback over the past three months, up 1.35% to 4.4255 as at March 31. However, it is still down 12% over the past year compared with 3.8905 on April 1 last year. In US dollar terms, the FBM KLCI has gained 8.1% YTD, outperforming some regional peers such as the Jakarta Composite Index (+6.8%) and the Nikkei (+4.8%), though lagging behind the Straits Times Index (+14.2%) and the Hang Seng Index (+10.2%). Banks and government-linked companies have driven the FBM KLCI\\u2019s rise this quarter, making up 7 of the top 10 gainers among its 30 constituents. Corporate announcements and news flow are a significant sentiment driver this quarter. A notable example is Sime Darby Bhd\\u2019s 14.57% rise up to March 31 as excitement builds over its much-anticipated demerger plan that will see the plantation and property units separately listed on Bursa. The demerger plan was announced in February, six months after Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar took the helm at Permodalan Nasional Bhd, the bumiputera equity firm that controls the majority of Sime Darby shares. With a reputation in corporate Malaysia as a \\u201cMr Fixit\\u201d, Wahid\\u2019s mandate is to improve the corporate performance of PNB\\u2019s stable of companies. When he took over, the cumulative performance of PNB companies underperformed the FBM KLCI. The impact on investor sentiment was almost immediate \\u2014 the collective showing of PNB companies overtook the benchmark in October and has outperformed the FBM KLCI year to date. Elsewhere across the market this quarter, the shift in sentiment and investing appetite is also clearly visible as investors opt for commodity and cyclical stocks over more defensive counters. While the inflection point came around October last year, the shift has been more pronounced so far this year. YTD, commodity counters are collectively up 10.5% while cyclicals are up 10.8%. In comparison, defensive counters are up by a total of 1.7%. Among the commodity counters that have done well are Press Metal Bhd which chalked up a YTD return of 66.1%, Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd (34.2%) and Batu Kawan Bhd (23.1%). The outperformers among the cyclicals were AirAsia Bhd (62.6%), Ekovest Bhd (48.1%) and Malaysia Building Society Bhd (44.4%). The defensive stocks that outperformed included My E.G. Services Bhd (25.2%), TIME dotCom Bhd (11.9%) and Axiata Bhd (9.1%). Ching of AllianceDBS Research expects this trend to continue as cyclical stocks tend to outperform defensive stocks in a liquidity-driven rally. \\u201cEarnings prospects for Malaysian equities have improved after the earnings downgrade cycle ended in 3Q2016. With a nascent earnings recovery and more stable commodity prices, cyclical stocks will outperform defensive stocks in 2017,\\u201d Ching says. Outside of the 30 top stocks making up the benchmark index, small and mid-cap companies are also taking off and outperformed the FBM KLCI. The FBM70 Index has risen 12% since the year began, while the FBM Small Cap Index grew 15.5%. Much of the bullishness has been seen in the technology counters, which is the best performing sector YTD with a 38.2% gain. Construction and property counters are also rallying by just over 15% each. Driving the tech sector\\u2019s rally is excitement over Apple Inc\\u2019s upcoming iPhone 8, with most expecting strong sales. Players within the Apple supply chain such as Globetronics Technology Bhd and Inari Amertron Bhd were among the first counters to surge. While Ching sees further upside for tech stocks, he says valuations are now quite fair after the YTD run-up and thinks a rerating will only happen once the iPhone 8 begins selling around the third quarter of the year. Meanwhile, the property rally is driven by investors seeing the sector as a good proxy to the larger market, says Kenanga Research head of equity research Sarah Lim. However, the rally is detached from physical market fundamentals and is more driven by news flow. Lim believes valuations have bottomed out and developers are unlikely to see substantial earnings misses this year. \\u201cMore likely, we will see most developers on target or slightly beating estimates for the full year in terms of sales.\\u201d Notably, the oil and gas sector rose 8.2% this quarter as global Brent crude oil prices remained steady around US$55 per barrel for most of the quarter, thanks to the six-month, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries-led output cut which began in January. However, the outlook for oil and gas stocks remains uncertain, says Ching, and will largely depend on company-specific news flow and further movement in oil prices. \\u201cWhile kitchen sinking and impairment charges are largely done, earnings recovery is still at a nascent stage and uneven, given the low utilisation rate (for vessel owners) and slow order book replenishment (for fabricators),\\u201d says Ching. As at March 30, Brent crude was trading at US$52.96 a barrel, down 7.8% from its YTD high of US$57.10 on Jan 6. \\u00a0 \\u00a0"}, "137": {"date_posted": "27/3/2017", "title": "Uber, millennials drive Asia's best-performing telecom stock XL Axiata", "article": " JAKARTA (March 27) Uber driver Akhmad Andy Riyanto spends about three times more than the average user on his mobile phone service in Jakarta \\u2014 and it\\u2019s helped PT XL Axiata become Asia\\u2019s best-performing telecom stock.

Investments in a fourth-generation network that overshadowed rivals\\u2019 spending and a reputation for providing the fastest data service in Indonesia is bringing in more users. XL Axiata shares ended 0.6% higher at 3,290 rupiah in Jakarta, reversing a 2.8% drop in intraday trading. \\u201cPeople no longer want to watch YouTube and have buffering,\\u201d XL Axiata\\u2019s President Director Dian Siswarini said in an interview on March 15. \\u201cCustomers had just wanted the cheapest price, but right now they are looking for a balance between price and performance. They are more willing to pay.\\u201d While the early years of industry competition were marked by intense price cuts, the focus is now on faster connectivity, said Siswarini, one of three women running a publicly listed company on the MSCI Indonesia Index. Falling revenue from voice calls also means data is the fastest growing business, she said. Riyanto, 20, spends about 90,000 rupiah (US$6.75) a month on data and voice services, compared with an average 35,000 rupiah spent by users at XL Axiata. Similarly priced packages from Telkomsel and Indosat offer less data. While XL Axiata claims a 15% market share \\u2014 half the size of its next biggest competitor, Indosat \\u2014 its users spend an average 40% more, according to data from Indosat and Axiata. Telkomsel covers most of the 17,000 islands in the archipelago but XL Axiata has been aggressively expanding its faster network. Last year, XL Axiata more than doubled its data-capable transmitters to almost 47,000 units, compared with a 43% increase of third- and fourth-generation networks by Telkomsel and a 20% expansion by Indosat. Telkomsel has almost 79,000 transmitters at the end of last year, while Indosat has about 32,400 units. \\u201cThey have the smallest subscriber base out of the three, so that corresponds to more data capacity per subscriber for XL Axiata,\\u201d said Niko Margaronis, a telecommunication analyst at PT Ciptadana Sekuritas in Jakarta. XL Axiata has twice as many transmitters per 1,000 customers than its rivals, allowing its network to be less congested. The company\\u2019s data traffic grew 1.6 times last year, contributing to 38% of the company\\u2019s total revenue, after the carrier offered discounts when it introduced a 4G network. Data traffic growth at Telkomsel was at 95%, while Indosat reported a 1.4 times jump last year. The aggressive expansion helped boost XL Axiata\\u2019s sales per customers, overtaking Indosat. The company\\u2019s average revenue per user grew 3% last year to 35,000 rupiah a month, while Indosat\\u2019s fell 3%. Market leader Telkomsel\\u2019s average user revenue grew by 5% in 2016. Millennial Spending XL Axiata is also targeting millennials, which make up a third of Indonesia\\u2019s 250 million population, as they constantly check on their Facebook and Twitter feeds. Indonesia ranked second in Asia in terms of number of Facebook users, with almost 78 million accounts as of May 2016, according to Statista Inc. Increasing spending power of the middle class will continue to drive demand for data, Siswarini said. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve got a number of consumers that will keep growing,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThe question is how we can get more revenue from this increase in traffic.\\u201d XL Axiata is planning to introduce fixed broadband services in the next two years, which may include pay-TV services, Siswarini said. The Indonesian unit was the biggest contributor to Axiata Group\\u2019s sales last year. For Riyanto, the speed and cheaper rates mean he\\u2019ll remain a loyal customer for now. \\u201cI haven\\u2019t seen any increase in telecom spending even after I became a driver for ride-sharing apps, because the rate is so cheap,\\u201d Riyanto said. \\u201cAll my family members are using XL.\\u201d \\u00a0"}, "138": {"date_posted": "24/3/2017", "title": "Axiata, TM deny merger on the cards", "article": " \\u00a0 KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia\\u2019s telecommunication giants, Axiata Group Bhd and Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), have quashed rumours that both companies are en route to a merger deal. \\u201cIn view of news articles building on the said speculation, Axiata wishes to specifically deny that it is currently engaged in any discussions with TM on a possible merger,\\u201d Axiata said in a stock exchange filing yesterday. \\u201cAxiata is committed [to] ensuring that material information is disseminated on a timely basis should there be any material information regarding the company,\\u201d the company said, adding that it will comply with the obligations stipulated under Bursa Malaysia\\u2019s Main Market Listing Requirements.

According to Bloomberg, the merged entity is worth about US$23.2 billion (RM102.54 billion), based on the combined enterprise value of US$12.4 billion for Vodafone India and US$10.8 billion for Idea Cellular. This merger is only expected to be completed in 2018. We estimate that Axiata\\u2019s stake in Idea Cellular is likely to be diluted from 19.8% to less than 10% post-completion of the merger. Given the dilution in shareholding, we think Axiata might consider selling its stake since it will not be able to equity-account Idea Cellular\\u2019s earnings in the future. However, we think this could take some time to materialise as it does not appear that either Vodafone India or Aditya Birla Group is interested in buying out Axiata\\u2019s stake. Assuming that the stake sale takes place at the current market valuation of RM4.4 billion (or 49 sen per share), this could help reduce Axiata\\u2019s gearing from 2.1 times to 1.6 times in terms of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. Axiata\\u2019s share price has been buoyed recently by several positive news flows including: i) potential stake sale in Singapore\\u2019s M1 Ltd; ii) potential stake sale in Idea Cellular; and iii) potential merger with Telekom Malaysia Bhd.

The ACE Market-listed LKL, which manufactures medical beds, peripherals and accessories, saw its revenue drop 38% to RM7.34 million from RM11.78 million, on subdued market conditions that had resulted in lower sales of its products. For the cumulative first nine months of the financial year (9MFY17), the group made a net profit of RM4.27 million, up 3.4% compared with the RM4.13 million reported for 9MFY16.

Vodafone Group and Idea Cellular will initially equally own the venture. The European carrier will control 45.1 percent of the combined company after selling a 4.9 percent stake in the new entity to billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla\\u2019s holding companies, according to a stock exchange filing Monday. Birla\\u2019s companies will take a 26 percent holding, with the remainder being held by the public. The enlarged wireless operator would have 395 million subscribers, exceeding those of market leader Bharti Airtel Ltd. The transaction will help Vodafone unload an unprofitable business that has prompted it to announce US$12 billion of additional investment and writedown to fight competition from billionaire Mukesh Ambani\\u2019s start up. The new company is worth US$23.2 billion, based on the combined enterprise value of US$12.4 billion for Vodafone India and US$10.8 billion for Idea Cellular. The Birla companies will pay 108 rupees apiece for the 4.9 percent stake in the merged entity, Saurabh Agarwal, head of strategy at the group, said at a press conference in Mumbai. The companies will have to pay 130 rupees a share if they want to raise their stake in the first three years and pay the market price in the fourth year, he said. Shares of Idea Cellular fell 7.6 percent to 99.90 rupees as of 1.26pm in Mumbai, after initially surging as much as 15 percent. Bigger scale The merger will help better utilize spectrum and the combined entity will have complementary footprint across India, Vodafone Group Chief Executive Officer Vittorio Colao said at the press conference. The deal gives higher return to shareholders due to the bigger scale of the new entity, he said. The combined entity will need to reduce spectrum it holds in a few regions to meet regulatory norms, said Colao. The excess airwaves will either be sold or returned to the government if they can\\u2019t find a buyer, he said. Vodafone and Idea will each control three seats on the board of the new company, which in addition will have six independent directors. Birla will have the right to appoint a chairman. Vodafone would gain a listing in the world\\u2019s second-largest wireless market, which it has been considering since at least 2011. Idea\\u2019s promoters will buy the 4.9 percent stake in the merged entity for 38.74 billion rupees in cash, on completion of the transaction. The latest transaction is expected to be completed in 2018, according to the statement. It\\u2019s the biggest deal to emerge after Ambani\\u2019s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. stormed into the market last year by offering free calls and data, pressuring other carriers to consolidate. Intense competition Last month, Bharti agreed to acquire Telenor ASA\\u2019s Indian business. The Norwegian state-controlled carrier said at the time that prospects for the industry didn\\u2019t warrant further investments. The competition among the different carriers will continue as they fight for market share in data, according to Rajan S. Mathews, the director general of Cellular Operators Association of India. \\u201cNow everybody is competing very aggressively for data share and that means there will be continued pressure on prices,\\u201d said Mathews. \\u201cIncreasingly, operators will start looking to future opportunities like Internet of Things and cloud computing, and begin to focus on these to augment their revenues and profitability.\\u201d Birla units, including Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd., own 42 percent of Idea, according to the company\\u2019s website.

However, the latest corporate reporting season has offered some hope of better days ahead. Still, don\\u2019t pop the champagne corks yet. Last week, 808 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia released their financial results for the quarters ended November or December 2016. (Bursa has 927 companies in total. The remaining 119 have different fiscal year-ends.) According to data compiled by The Edge, 440 companies reported better year-on-year financial performance for 4Q2016 while 368 reported the converse. Of the 440 that performed better, 273 posted higher profits, 101 returned to the black while 66, though they still lost money, narrowed their losses. As for those that fared worse than a year ago, 209 reported lower profits, 91 slipped into the red while 68 saw wider losses. So, of the 808 companies, 583 are profitable while 225 are loss-making. Overall, the situation is positive \\u2014 unless, of course, the remaining 119 companies (13% of public limited companies) post poor 4Q results later this month. This is consistent with aggregate headline corporate earnings (including extraordinary items), which grew 7% year on year to RM20.5 billion in 4Q (see charts). Note that these figures are based on only those companies that have reported their 4Q results. When the figures of the remaining 119 are included, total corporate earnings are likely to be higher than RM20.5 billion. It is also worth noting that total corporate earnings contracted for four consecutive quarters \\u2014 from 3Q2015 to 2Q2016 \\u2014 before growing in 3Q and 4Q last year. Excluding those that have not reported their 4Q results, sectors that pulled up corporate earnings are banking, conglomerate and hospitality. Malayan Banking Bhd, the country\\u2019s largest lender, saw its net profit jump 43% to RM2.36 billion in 4Q, buoyed by an improvement in revenue from a pick-up in loans as well as a robust fee income and underscored by disciplined cost management that resulted in a smaller rise in overhead expenses. Hong Leong Bank Bhd\\u2019s net profit rose as well, by 60% to RM549.94 million due to higher net income, lower operating expenses and lower charge on allowance for impairment losses on loans, advances and financing (see \\u201cHave banks traded ahead of fundamentals?\\u201d on Page 10). Conglomerate Sime Darby Bhd\\u2019s net profit more than doubled to RM644 million, driven by its plantation division, which benefited from an increase in crude palm oil prices and higher fresh fruit bunch production. In the hospitality sector, Genting Malaysia Bhd saw a fourfold increase in net profit to RM1.69 billion while Genting Bhd\\u2019s net profit surged 237% to RM1.14 billion. Note that there is double counting here as Genting controls Genting Malaysia, whose earnings were boosted by a RM1.27 billion gain from the sale of its 16.8% stake in Genting Hong Kong Ltd to Golden Hope Ltd. As for the oil and gas sector, downstream players benefited from recovering crude oil prices while upstream players that provide support services registered larger impairment losses. The sectors that dragged down corporate earnings were healthcare and telecommunications. \\u00a0 BEST PERFORMERS Oil and gas downstream Thanks to higher oil prices, downstream players, such as petrol retailer Petronas Dagangan Bhd (PetDag), Shell Refining Co Federation of Malaya Bhd, Petron Malaysia Refining & Marketing Bhd and Gas Malaysia Bhd, saw their combined earnings almost triple to RM633.5 million in 4Q, up from RM215.1 million a year ago. Dated Brent has recovered gradually, rising to an average of US$54 per barrel at end-2016 from as low as US$31 per barrel at the start of the year. PetDag\\u2019s net profit soared 183% to RM261.49 million \\u2014 mainly due to improved margins from petrol \\u2014 in line with the upward trend in Means of Platts Singapore prices in the second half of last year. Shell posted a 115% rise in net profit to RM207.8 million, attributed to the gradual recovery in the prices of crude oil and other products. Petron, meanwhile, recorded a near sevenfold increase in net profit to RM112.62 million on growing sales volume and higher margins. Gas Malaysia, which distributes natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas to residences and industries, saw its net profit multiply five times to RM51.86 million on higher volume of gas sold, toll fees and assets contributed by customers. \\u00a0 Plantations After being overlooked in the past couple of years, plantation players seem to be gaining momentum as commodity prices stage a comeback. Genting Plantations Bhd, TH Plantations Bhd, Boustead Plantations Bhd, TSH Resources Bhd and Hap Seng Consolidated Bhd all ended 2016 on a high note. Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd and IOI Corp Bhd may have weighed the sector\\u2019s earnings down but this was due to a high base effect and the foreign exchange factor. KLK\\u2019s net profit more than halved to RM360.68 million from a year ago when a one-off gain of RM485.7 million from the disposal of plantation land was booked. Excluding this, the group\\u2019s pre-tax profit should be 11% higher. IOI\\u2019s net profit fell 98% to RM15.6 million due to a forex translation loss of RM330 million on its foreign currency-denominated borrowings. Other than the two, most of the plantation players posted better earnings except TDM Bhd, which suffered a loss of RM21.6 million due to bigger losses at its Indonesian operation, mainly from the impairment of assets. \\u00a0 Consumer finance The jump in the earnings of consumer finance companies may not seem as significant as that of traditional banking groups but Malaysia Building Society Bhd, AEON Credit Service M Bhd and RCE Capital Bhd have been quietly making profits by giving out loans. MBSB, AEON Credit and RCE Capital saw their financial performance improve by RM61.45 million, RM13.69 million and RM8.77 million respectively in 4Q2016. Financial service provider MBSB returned to the black with a quarterly net profit of RM45.64 million versus a net loss of RM15.81 million a year earlier on higher Islamic financing income and lower bad loan allowance. \\u00a0 WORST PERFORMERS \\u00a0 Telecommunications Telecoms players reported a mixed bag of 4Q report cards. The financial results of Axiata Group Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) and DiGi.Com Bhd were weaker while those of TIME dotCom Bhd and Maxis Bhd were stronger. However, the overall corporate earnings of the sector were severely hit by Axiata, which reported a net loss of RM309.5 million in 4Q2016 versus a net profit of RM467.24 million the year before due to a significant increase in forex loss, a lower contribution from 20%-owned Idea Cellular Ltd in India and the weaker performance of Celcom. Similarly, TM saw its net profit fall nearly 20% to RM154.3 million, also primarily due to forex losses from group borrowings, arising from the ringgit\\u2019s depreciation against the US dollar. DiGi\\u2019s net profit dropped 2% to RM374.63 million in 4Q2016 as revenue also fell on lower prepaid income and the group registering higher taxes. The poorer performance of these companies raises the question of whether they can still pay out decent dividends to shareholders. \\u00a0 Healthcare and pharmaceuticals Most healthcare and pharmaceutical companies ended the year on a low note, save for KPJ Healthcare Bhd and YSP Southeast Asia Holdings Bhd. Pharmaniaga Bhd, Apex Healthcare Bhd and CCM Duopharma Biotech Bhd saw their earnings shrink by RM16.9 million, RM7 million and RM5.4 million respectively. But the bombshell came from IHH Healthcare Bhd, which slipped into the red with a net loss of RM42.5 million compared with a net profit of RM415.8 million in the previous year. The hospital operator made an exchange loss of RM244.59 million in 4Q2016 against an exchange gain of RM121.27 million the year before. Besides, it recognised higher doubtful debt expenses of RM49 million in 4Q2016 compared with RM9.9 million the year before. \\u00a0 Oil and gas services Although global oil prices are headed higher, upstream players such as Bumi Armada Bhd, UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd (UMWOG), TH Heavy Engineering Bhd, Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd, Alam Maritim Resources Bhd and Petra Energy Bhd have yet to shine. A whopping impairment charge of RM1.15 billion resulted in Bumi Armada\\u2019s net loss widening to RM1.29 billion. UMWOG saw its net loss double to RM918.4 million, due mainly to an additional asset impairment loss of RM780.2 million. It has not gone unnoticed that these companies took advantage of the present environment and conducted kitchen sinking in 4Q. Theoretically, if oil prices continue to recover gradually, more jobs should come in and these O&G service providers should come out of the woods. \\u00a0 WORST MAY BE OVER If the latest numbers are any indication, overall corporate earnings showed signs of improvement in 4Q2016, suggesting that the worst may be over and things should get better in 1Q this year. After all, crude oil prices are holding up well and commodity prices are recovering steadily. According to Areca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong Teck Meng, three years ago, the downward trend in corporate earnings was caused by higher costs and a shrinking top line, which squeezed margins. But today, corporate earnings are recovering in tandem with oil prices. \\u201cI\\u2019m optimistic about the outlook for corporate earnings because the cost structure has become leaner. So, margins will improve even if revenue remains stagnant. There is also the low base effect,\\u201d he tells The Edge. But he warns, \\u201cIt was bad in the past three years. We were in a bearish and cautious mood, so the turnaround in mood may not be felt immediately.\\u201d Wong also points out how more Americans appear to be accepting President Donald Trump\\u2019s policies as he seems to be able to get things done. \\u201cAssuming he (Trump) really manages to fulfil some of his pledges, such as the US$1 trillion worth of infrastructure, it bodes well for global growth. In short, if he manages to drive the American economy, there should also be an improvement in consumer spending and confidence as well as overall corporate earnings.\\u201d Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd dealer representative Frank Lin concurs. \\u201cIn the last few months, the important stock indices, especially the Dow Jones, have been hitting new highs and American investors seem to have taken a liking to their president. Despite its debt problems, Europe is very stable while China is recovering,\\u201d he tells The Edge. Lin believes that there is light at the end of the tunnel for corporate earnings and that the stock market is reacting to it at the moment. \\u201cConstruction will continue to do well while plantations will pick up because of higher commodity prices. The consumer sector should perform fairly well too. As stock markets gain momentum, given time, real estate prices usually follow suit, which in turn will see new excitement in property counters,\\u201d he says. However, he warns that once the global economy picks up, central bankers, especially the US Federal Reserve, may tighten their monetary policies by raising interest rates. In fact, the Fed is expected to raise rates as early as this month. \\u201cThe [current] depressed interest rate is actually helping the economy a lot. This will be one of the major concerns now as the stock market usually reacts negatively to rate hikes.\\u201d A head of research, who declined to be named, is, however, not too optimistic about earnings growth. \\u201cWe think there is still more downside risk for earnings, especially in 1H2017. We think earnings will hit bottom and recover [only] later in the year and in 2018,\\u201d she says. \\u00a0 "}, "150": {"date_posted": "16/3/2017", "title": "KLCI rises 0.79%, crosses 1,730-level", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (March 16): The FBM KLCI rose 0.79% at mid-morning today and crossed the 1,730-point level on some firm bargain hunting activities.

", "article": " \\u00a0 2016 is a year we want to forget,\\u201d says Axiata Group Bhd president and group CEO Tan Sri Jamaludin Ibrahim in his usual energetic and straightforward manner. No coffee for him today, only a cup of hot Milo for what must be a long day. It is now 5pm in Axiata\\u2019s boardroom that overlooks KL Sentral. Jamaludin has just wrapped up a two-hour-long conference call with analysts, and before that he was taking questions from the media. Jamaludin has spent the whole day addressing the group\\u2019s first quarterly net loss in six years - RM272.06 million for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2016, and a sharp drop in dividends from 20 sen to eight sen per share for FY2016 and FY2017. Not surprisingly, Axiata saw its share price plunge following the release of its fourth-quarter and full-year FY2016 results last Thursday. At last Friday\\u2019s close of RM4.31 apiece, the stock has lost 10%, or RM4.3 billion, of its market capitalisation. But if Jamaludin is feeling the pressure, he certainly does not show it. Instead, he seems perkier than usual. \\u201cFor the most part, the poor results can be attributed to one-off costs that we won\\u2019t apologise for \\u2014 the\\u00a0 merger of Robi and Airtel in Bangladesh, acquisition of (an 80% stake) in Ncell (Pte Ltd) in Nepal, and the foreign exchange losses that are beyond our control. These [exercises] have to be done for the long term, so we are okay with that,\\u201d says Jamaludin. Without the unfavourable forex rate movement that resulted in RM824 million in losses, he points out that Axiata\\u2019s FY2016 earnings would have been on a par with that in FY2015. \\u201cBut the area where we can acknowledge the problem is our op-co (operating companies) performance in Malaysia and, to some extent, Indonesia,\\u201d he says. Stripping out one-off costs and impairments, Axiata saw its profit-after-tax and minority interests (PATMI) fall RM653 million, or 31.5%, year on year, due to weaker operational performance. This can largely be pinned on Celcom Axiata Bhd, which saw its PATMI fall 25.2% y-o-y to RM966 million in FY2016. Intense competition in the sector contributed to the poor results, but Jamaludin makes it clear that he is not satisfied with Celcom\\u2019s performance, which, he says, is the worst among the incumbents. The good news is that FY2016\\u2019s poor performance is the kick that Celcom needed to step up its game. Externally, this can be clearly seen by the changes in Celcom\\u2019s management \\u2014 Michael Kuehner replaced Datuk Seri Shazalli Ramly as CEO last year. \\u201cThere are four main problems with Celcom \\u2014 product, network, distribution and organisation,\\u201d explains Jamaludin. He blames IT problems for the delay in launching new products quickly, but points out that Celcom will catch up by the end of the first quarter. While the spectrum refarming delayed network upgrades by about six months, Jamaludin concedes that internal problems exacerbated the delays. However, he aims to improve Celcom\\u2019s network to become either the best or second best in most places by year-end. Distribution is perhaps the toughest problem Celcom faces, notes Jamaludin. Without providing details on how he will solve the shortcomings, he assures that they will be addressed by year-end. Meanwhile, he expects Celcom to adjust to the changes in senior management by the second half of the year. In short, Celcom will be finding its footing this year. \\u00a0 A lacklustre 2017 Jamaludin expects the group to stabilise this year after several years of aggressive expansion. However, he cautions that there are still some risks that the group has to look out for \\u2014unfavourable forex movement and regulatory risks in the form of additional spectrum fees. That said, this year might still be good, given that 2016 has set a pretty low base. \\u201c2016 was a perfect storm. External factors such as forex [losses of about RM824 million] hit us hard. If I add that back to my profit, I\\u2019d be on par with 2015,\\u201d says Jamaludin. \\u201cThen we had regulatory issues. It is unheard-of to pay RM820 million for spectrum (fees in Malaysia). Then we had the CGT (capital gains tax) issue in Nepal that hit us for US$24 million. And then, XL in Indonesia \\u2014 we were so sure they [the authorities] would approve network sharing, but in the end they did not. The interconnection in Indonesia was also announced, but eventually it was retracted,\\u201d he adds. Political changes abroad also made operating in these foreign environments even more challenging. \\u201cWe were working on some programmes in Cambodia. I was supposed to meet a minister. But just as I arrived in the morning, I was told the minister had been replaced. It happened while I was on the plane. So, what about the lunch meeting? It had to be a farewell lunch, I was told,\\u201d says Jamaludin. \\u201cI was also supposed to meet the Nepalese prime minister to sort out the CGT issue. I had an appointment set up and flew over. But when I arrived that night, I was told there has been a change in government. Again, I was on the plane when it happened,\\u201d he says. Looking ahead, this year will also see several changes that will strengthen Axiata. For starters, the dividend cut will give the company some breathing room to stabilise. The reduction is estimated to save RM2 billion overtwo years. This will not only reduce the group\\u2019s dependence on borrowings, it will also give Axiata more resources to undertake acquisitions if the opportunity arises. Jamaludin also plans to halve Axiata\\u2019s unhedged US dollar debt exposure that now stands at about US$1.4 billion. Axiata had inherited about US$1.4 billion of US dollar debts when it acquired Ncell, of which US$1.1 billion was unhedged. It signed the deal when the ringgit was valued at 3.9 against the dollar. The subsequent depreciation of the ringgit to 4.48 against the greenback created the massive forex losses. The good news is that RM512 million of the forex losses are unrealised.This means if the ringgit strengthens, Axiata may yet be able to book in some forex gains. It is interesting to note that Axiata booked an accelerated depreciation of about RM600 million during the year \\u2014 RM193 million for XL in Indonesia and RM111 million for Robi in Bangladesh. Celcom also took the opportunity to \\u201cclean up\\u201d its inactive subscribers, removing nearly 400,000 in 4QFY2016. Axiata may come off a low base, but without a catalyst this year, its share price might remain lacklustre. However, additional selling pressure on the group\\u2019s shares may make it attractive to accumulate. After all, Axiata is expected to resume paying 20 sen a share \\u00addividends by 2018, if all goes well. \\u00a0 \\u00a0"}, "154": {"date_posted": "7/3/2017", "title": "Mixed bag of earnings for telcos", "article": " \\u00a0 Telecommunication sector\n(March 6, Neutral)\nUpgrade to neutral from overweight: Although the fourth quarter of 2016 (4Q16) results were broadly within expectations, sector earnings declined 24% in 2016 amid weaker revenue and higher costs. The 58% collapse in Axiata Group Bhd\\u2019s earnings was a major disappointment. Meanwhile, Maxis Bhd held up pretty well, operationally, amid shrinking sector revenue.

We still like DiGi for its sector exposure, but Maxis\\u2019 resilience is also a compelling reason to own the stock. To sum it up, Malaysian telecommunications companies (telcos) reported a mixed bag of earnings for 4Q16 but broadly in line with expectations despite the 24% contraction in earnings. Sequentially, earnings contracted 13% due to massive accelerated depreciation charges at Axiata. At the headline net profit level, Axiata recorded a quarterly net loss hit by foreign exchange losses on its US-dollar loans. Maxis\\u2019 resilience stands out. Operationally, the celcos reported the third consecutive year of decline in revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda). This has been due to competition from unlisted player U Mobile. Maxis has nevertheless managed to gain revenue share over the past two years. Its new management team (new chief executive officer from late 2013), revamped product/pricing strategy and premium network have started to bear fruit. Surprisingly, despite the competition and the stronger US dollar, sector margins have held up impressively well on cost efficiency and possibly more efficient use of its data network. Sector earnings are expected to rebound by a sharp 12% in 2017 after the 24% decline in 2016. Excluding Axiata, sector earnings are projected to grow at a more realistic 1%, consistent with the guidance by celcos of flattish revenue and Ebitda levels for 2017. However, we do not foresee sector earnings returning to the RM7 billion range (2013 to 2015 levels) over the near term dragged by enhanced competition within the celco space and operational losses at webe for Telekom Malaysia.

The sector however lacks any rerating catalyst while valuations are demanding vis-a-vis historical average especially amid increased competition. Likewise, we think that dividend yield plays are unlikely to outperform in a rising yield environment. Moreover sector yields at 3% are not too compelling.

Idea, which registered a 4Q of 2016 (4Q16) loss of 3.8 billion rupiah versus a 3Q16 net profit of 915 million rupiah, is expected to remain in the red in FY17 on persistently depressed average revenue per user (ARPUs) as new cellular rival Reliance Jio Infocomm\\u2019s free voice and 4G data service promotion, which began in September 2016, has been extended from Dec 31, 2016 until March 2017.

While we are positive about the appointment of Celcom\\u2019s new chief executive officer Michael Keuhner, who joined September last year, we expect incremental progress in operational improvement against the background of intense competition amid the re-entry of TM\\u2019s webe service. Given the poor performance of Idea and M1, Axiata\\u2019s 4QFY16 results, scheduled to be announced on Feb 23, 2017, are likely to be weak, but should be largely in line with our own assumptions. While operational issues will continue to drag Axiata\\u2019s earnings in the medium term, we highlight that the stock currently trades at a bargain FY17 enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation of five times, far below 13 times for Maxis and Digi.

Discussions are at a preliminary stage and subject to a number of approvals (like the telecommunication regulator, the Competition Commission of India) but Idea\\u2019s stock price is up more than 40% from Jan 18 this year \\u2014 effectively pricing in a reasonable portion of the estimated merger gains, in our view. While the gains for Idea quantify to limited upside for Axiata arising from its diversified portfolio (about 25% gain in Idea\\u2019s share price mathematically quantifies to about 2% upside for Axiata\\u2019s share price), we believe a potential merger would be directionally positive with increased expectations of Axiata benefiting from consolidation in other markets. Industry restructuring or rationalisation is one of the key objectives for Axiata and opportunities exist in Malaysia and Indonesia, in our view. Axiata\\u2019s strategy is to also drive return on invested capital (ROIC) improvement through potential portfolio optimisation, which we believe could drive a rerating. Our current rating is \\u201cneutral\\u201d. Idea has further revealed that merger discussions are at a preliminary stage and the fundamental premise of the discussion is equal rights between the Aditya Birla Group and Vodafone in the combined entity. For equal rights, it may be necessary for the Aditya Birla Group to infuse funds into Idea. Benchmarking to major in-market mobile-mobile mergers that have taken place in Europe over recent years, we estimate a potential Vodafone-Idea merger could result in annual run rate savings of 82 billion rupees (RM5.4 billion) comprising 52 billion rupees in operating expenditure (opex) and 31 billion rupees in capital expenditure (capex), leading to net present value of synergies of 600 billion rupees or about US$9 billion (RM39.87 billion). Targeted synergies in intramarket consolidations in Europe have been 8% to 10% of combined opex and 18% to 20% of combined capex. Merger integration costs have often eliminated around 20% to 30% of these targeted savings, whereas in some cases operators have also guided to hope for revenue synergies. We note the expected true realisable synergies from a Vodafone-Idea merger would be far more substantial than the benchmark drive figure suggests as the merger would drive stronger network cost savings as spectrum ownership in India currently is much scarcer than across other global telecommunication markets. Industry restructuring or rationalisation is one of the key objectives for Axiata. In our view, opportunities exist in Malaysia and Indonesia. Consolidation in Malaysia could ease intense market competition and capex requirements. Our discussions with Indonesian telecommunication companies (telcos) indicate a general acknowledgement of the need for a healthier industry structure through consolidation. With relatively limited spectrum allocation, visibility on spectrum retention could be a key factor in driving industry consolidation in Indonesia. Due to wireless data and network cost economics, Axiata\\u2019s ROIC has declined to below the weighted average cost of capital. As part of its strategy, Axiata could now assess portfolio optimisation to reduce exposure where ROIC has been lagging and improvement is more challenging. Axiata plans on increasing capital allocation to operating companies with higher ROIC potential. Our analysis suggests that global emerging market telcos trade reflexively to ROICs. The ROIC improvement through portfolio potential could drive a rerating of Axiata\\u2019s share price, in our view. \\u2014 JP Morgan, Jan 31"}, "166": {"date_posted": "6/2/2017", "title": "KLCI expected to move higher, aim to cross 1,700 level", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 6): The FBM KLCI is expected to move higher and attempt to breach the psychologically crucial 1,700 point level today, in line with the firmer close at most global markets last Friday.

Bursa said in a filing that its earnings were dragged by lower profit from its securities market division, with the segment's net profit down 8.9% to RM65 million from RM71.4 million in 4QFY15. However, this was mitigated by better performance of the derivatives markets division, which chalked an 11.6% increase in segment profit to RM14.3 million from RM12.8 million in 4QFY15, thanks to lower operating expenses. Bursa's lower quarterly earnings was in line with the decline in its quarterly revenue, which fell by 8.7% to RM123.74 million from RM135.56 million a year ago, dragged by lower trading revenue and lower effective clearing fee rate.

The talks with Idea controlling holder Aditya Birla Group could lead to Vodafone splitting off its Indian business into a separate entity, Vodafone said Monday in a statement. Aditya Birla and Vodafone would have equal rights in the new company, Idea said. Idea rose as much as 29%, the most since the shares began trading in 2007, bringing the company\\u2019s market value above US$5 billion. Vodafone gained as much as 4.1%. The all-stock deal would allow Vodafone Chief Executive Officer Vittorio Colao to deconsolidate the troubled Indian unit, which has been a drag on earnings. In addition to the writedown, the carrier was forced to pump more than US$7 billion into the unit last year. Carriers in India are seeking to consolidate after Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, India\\u2019s richest man, introduced free services undermining industry revenue. \\u201cIndia needs consolidation \\u2014 there\\u2019s just way too many operators there and that\\u2019s prevented any of them from ever making the kinds of money that they\\u2019d hoped for,\\u201d said Allan Nichols, an analyst at Morningstar Inc in Amsterdam. For Vodafone, \\u201cIndia has higher growth rates and it\\u2019s always done well at adding subscribers, but it\\u2019s never done a good job at bringing that to the bottom line.\\u201d A deal isn\\u2019t certain, nor are the terms or timing of any transaction, Newbury, UK-based Vodafone said. Vodafone\\u2019s Indian unit is the No. 2 carrier in the country and Idea is the No. 3. A merger would create an operator with 387 million subscribers, a 36% market share and airwaves for faster 4G services spanning the entire country. Vodafone would also gain a listing in India, which it has been considering since at least 2011. Vodafone said that the deal wouldn\\u2019t include its 42% stake in Indus Towers. Potential risks to the deal include a breach of spectrum limits that could force the merged entity to sell off valuable airwaves in a few circles, according to a report by Sanford C. Bernstein & Co The merged entity would have net debt of about 718 billion rupees (US$10.6 billion), based on reported borrowings. Vodafone advanced 2.9% to 198.9 pence at 10:43am in London after rising as high as 201.25 pence, while Idea gained 25% to 97.70 rupees in India. Bharti Airtel Ltd, India\\u2019s largest carrier, also surged. Jio\\u2019s Impact Prior to Jio\\u2019s entry, Airtel, Vodafone and Idea were able to increase revenue and profit, even as they borrowed heavily to pay for spectrum and infrastructure. Jio, which stormed India\\u2019s crowded cellphone market with free voice calls for life, has spurred rivals to cut prices and expand their mobile broadband networks. A merger of Vodafone\\u2019s India business and Idea would lead to economies of scale and significant savings on spectrum for the new entity, Saeed Baradar, a telecoms sales specialist at Louis Capital Markets UK LLP, said in a note. Still, Vodafone separating its Indian unit would mean it is no longer consolidating a business that had a disproportionate impact on growth of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and free cash flow, Baradar said. Ambani plans to invest a further 300 billion rupees in Jio, in addition to over US$25 billion already invested in the carrier, to expand the network coverage and capacity, it said in a stock exchange filing this month. In December, Jio announced that it would offer data for free until March 31, extending its free trial period by three months. Airtel, which reported a 55% drop in quarterly profit Jan 24, said that \\u201cpredatory pricing\\u201d was hurting the industry. India\\u2019s Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal will hear a case Feb 1 that Airtel filed against the nation\\u2019s telecom regulator for allowing Jio to continue its free services. Aditya Birla Group entities, including Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd, own 42.2% of Idea, according to the company\\u2019s website. Malaysian carrier Axiata Group Bhd has a 19.8% stake.

In what has been described as the largest placement exercise for the telco tower sector in 2016, Axiata said INCJ has committed to subscribe for 546.54 million primary shares for US$400 million in edotco, while Khazanah Nasional via Mount Bintang Ventures Sdn Bhd has committed to subscribe for 273.27 million secondary shares for US$200 million.

Axiata Group Bhd currently owns a 19.79% stake in Idea Cellular Ltd, the third-largest telecommunications (telco) player in India (17% market share). In 2010, Axiata made an RM1 billion impairment loss in respect of its investment in Idea, mainly due to the discrepancy between the carrying value and market value of Idea as a result of intense price competition in India\\u2019s telco market. However, Idea\\u2019s profitability recovered strongly from financial year ending Dec 31, 2012 (FY12) onwards as the market expanded exponentially. For financial year 2017\\u2019s forecast (FY17F), however, Idea is expected to post a sharp decline in earnings. 2016 was a landmark year for the Indian telco sector due to the entry of a greenfield player, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which introduced fierce price competition into the market by offering free voice calls and low-cost data. Note that the market has traditionally been voice-driven. Going forward, we expect margins to remain under pressure as the decline in voice revenue (free voice products have been offered) is not sufficiently compensated by growth in data revenue (due to low mobile data tariffs). Operators are likely to face immense pressure to retain customers by offering freebies and rebates. In November 2016, Vodafone recognised a \\u20ac5 billion (RM23.8 billion) write-down for its Indian subsidiary, the second-largest telco player in the country (19% market share). We believe there is a possibility that Axiata may have to further impair its investment value in Idea in the near term.

Two sources told The Edge Financial Daily that the fund, which is linked to a local life sciences company, is ready to make an offer for nine sen per share, which values Palette at RM28.76 million. The nine sen offer price represents a 50% premium to Palette\\u2019s closing share price of six sen last Friday. When contacted, Palette chairman and managing director Eg Kah Yee admitted to having received a written takeover offer that came through a local bank-backed investment bank, but declined to elaborate. \\u201cOver the years, we have some companies coming to us [with proposals]. But recently, yes, there is a fresh offer on the table to take a controlling stake in our company. We will study the deal, discuss [with board members], and figure out what\\u2019s the next step,\\u201d he told The Edge Financial Daily via telephone. \\u201cWe are looking at it, but [there\\u2019s] nothing concrete at the moment. We are not in a selling mode, but I believe anything is sellable and everything has a price tag,\\u201d Eg said. Eg, 56, is the founder and single largest shareholder of Palette with a 17% stake. He is also the chief executive officer of Key Asic Bhd, a supplier of high performance, low power application-specific integrated circuit design and manufacturing services. Founded in 1997, Palette is a solutions provider of broadband, wireless and networking products and services. Its clients include Telekom Malaysia Bhd, Celcom Axiata Bhd, Maxis Bhd and Shell Refining Co (Federation of Malaya) Bhd. Based on Palette\\u2019s net assets of RM11.7 million or 3.66 sen per share as of Aug 31, 2016, the stock is currently trading at a price-to-book value of 1.6 times. However, it is learnt that the potential buyer is willing to pay between two and 2.5 times Palette\\u2019s book value in order to gain a controlling stake in the company. At the nine sen per share offer price, the prospective investor will have to fork out about RM14 million for the 51% stake in Palette. While the actual structure of the takeover is still up in the air, the proposed deal is likely to trigger a mandatory general offer (MGO) as its shareholding crosses the 33% threshold level. Still, the prospective investor can seek a waiver for the MGO. Meanwhile, it also remains to be seen as whether the fund is keen to run the company together with Eg, or prefer a buyout that would eventually see him exiting Palette. After reporting seven consecutive years of losses, Palette returned to the black in the financial year ended May 31, 2016 (FY16) with a net profit of RM2.1 million on revenue of RM3.6 million. However, the group slipped back into the red in first quarter of FY17 with a net loss of RM516,000 on revenue of RM222,000. There was no comparable period as Palette had changed its year end to May 31 from Dec 31. Going forward, Palette is expecting its mobile healthcare platform to be a key revenue driver for FY17. The platform, dubbed i-medic, connects doctors and specialists with patients, through the use of multiple medical and fitness-tracking devices, via a mobile application that runs on smart devices. On the sidelines of Palette\\u2019s annual general meeting last month, Eg reportedly said the company will be focusing on the China market first, banking on the large population and growing affluence of the people, and has inked a deal with Shanghai International Medical Centre to set up an international mobile healthcare centre, known as \\u201cThe 3rd Centre\\u201d. \\u201cPatients will no longer need to visit the doctors face-to-face as frequently as before, and this is a big step forward for international medical tourism,\\u201d he said. Due to its disruptive nature, some people even called Palette\\u2019s i-medic the \\u201cUber\\u201d or \\u201cAlibaba\\u201d of the medical sector. Interestingly, Palette also plans to diversify into traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to expand its earnings base. The company had on Nov 24 said it had entered into a term sheet to acquire a 51% stake in Genopharma Sdn Bhd (GSB) for RM1.53 million. GSB is principally involved in the trading of TCM, food and herbal supplements. Currently, GSB products are sold at TCM clinics, pharmacies and chain stores. It also supplies herbal-based medicines and supplements to hospitals and clinics in Malaysia. \\u201cThe proposed acquisition will enable Palette to expand its earnings base and invest in a profitable business. Hence, the term sheet is to set the parameters of transaction and allow the parties to outline the terms and conditions, as well as their understanding and intention in respect of the proposed acquisition,\\u201d Palette said. Palette added that it would issue new shares in the company as payment for the GSB stake."}, "182": {"date_posted": "15/12/2016", "title": "KLCI struggles in line with regional markets, down 0.65%", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 15): The FBM KLCI struggled at mid-morning and remained down 0.65%, weighed by key blue chips including index-linked banking stocks.

After failing to break the sideways trend resistance at 1,632 points in the past three weeks, the FBM KLCI finally broke and stayed above this level. The index increased 0.8% in a week to 1,641.42 points on low trading volume. Yesterday, the index closed at 1,645.28 points. The average daily trading volume last week was only 1.2 billion shares, compared with 1.5 billion shares two weeks ago. The average trading value declined from RM2 billion two weeks ago to RM1.7 billion. This indicates that the market is quiet as holiday mood looms. Total market valuation increased RM11 billion from the previous week to RM1,652 billion last Friday.\\u00a0 Foreign institutions started to buy in the last two days of last week as the ringgit strengthened slightly against the US dollar, but they were net sellers the whole of last week. Net selling from foreign institutions last week was RM393 million. Net buying from local institutions and local retailers RM372 million and RM21 million respectively.

Crude palm oil on Bursa Malaysia fell 0.2% in a week to RM3,070 per tonne after hitting a 4.5-year high early last week. After three weeks of sideways moves, the FBM KLCI is beginning to show some direction now. Firstly, the index broke above the immediate resistance level at 1,630 points, and secondly, it rose above the short term 30-day moving average. This indicates that the index is starting to turn bullish in the short term. However, the FBM KLCI is still below the long-term 200-day moving average and the Ichimoku Cloud indicator, and this shows the trend is still bearish in the long term. Momentum indicators are starting to indicate that market sentiment has turned bullish. The Relative Strength Index and moving average convergence divergence indicators also show the trend is turning bullish. Furthermore, the FBM KLCI is now trading above the top band of the Bollinger Bands indicator. However, the momentum is weak as trading volume in the past few weeks has been low.\\u00a0 With only three weeks left to trading, we expect the market to climb higher for window dressing. The support that we have seen in the past few weeks and the breakout of the resistance last week indicate that there has been some accumulation. The plantation, oil and gas, banking and telecommunications sectors may benefit from this as these sectors have taken a beating since early this year. Therefore, the index is set to stage a short-term rally towards the next resistance level at 1,660 to 1,665 points by the end of this year, and after that, a pullback is expected in the first few weeks of January for a correction.

David Smith, who is head of corporate governance at Aberdeen Asia, said the EPS growth of Malaysian corporates is expected to be higher than the forecast 4% to 5% of gross domestic product growth for Malaysia in 2017. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s positive for us on Malaysian equities is that domestic consumption has stayed resilient despite the goods and services tax [implemented in 2015]. \\u201cWe think Malaysia is somewhat attractive within this region, [but it comes down to] stock selection. We have to find companies that are going to be leveraging off domestic consumption and demand,\\u201d he said at a news conference in conjunction with Aberdeen\\u2019s \\u201cAugmented Reality\\u201d presentation yesterday. Aberdeen Asia-Pacific head of multi-asset solutions Irene Goh said that at present, Malaysia and other Asian equity markets are not seeing a multiple expansion in indices due to uncertainties such as the pressure on currencies and capital flight from emerging markets. \\u201cHopefully when we get to 2017, there will be more clarity on trade policies, and [if] Donald Trump the pragmatist and businessman shows up in the White House rather than Donald Trump the populist, maybe we can get tailwinds that are supportive of better market performance for equities in the region,\\u201d she said. As for the outlook for fixed income investment in Malaysia, Aberdeen Islamic Asset Management investment manager Mohammad Hasif said that bonds with longer terms, or at the \\u201clong end\\u201d of the curve, are attractive. \\u201cAt Aberdeen, we have been fundamentally positive on Malaysia for some time, so we took opportunities in the longer end of the Malaysian bond space, basically 20- to 30-year Malaysian Government Securities, as we think that part looks attractive, even on a forward-looking basis. \\u201cThe longer end of the Malaysian government bond space has generally been well supported by the Employees Provident Fund, insurance companies and pension funds, so we think that part of the bond curve is well anchored,\\u201d he said. Mohammad Hasif said another theme adopted by Aberdeen is to move into US dollar Malaysian bonds. \\u201cUS dollar Malaysian issuances such as Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) issuances and Axiata Group Bhd\\u2019s [US dollar bonds] which have [been] sold off and had been expensive previously, have now started to look quite cheap. \\u201cSo what we have done is switching from some of our expensive bonds such as [South] Korean US dollar bonds to some of the Malaysian bonds which have started to look cheap after the sell-off. For US dollar credits, we look at it more on a spread basis as opposed to an outright yield. \\u201cWe are fundamentally positive on these companies. Petronas, for example, despite the [low] oil prices, has had a very disciplined management of its finances, and has a very pragmatic management of its capex (capital expenditure) programmes. So with that, and a cheap valuation, it was a very easy decision for us to make,\\u201d he said.

In fact, this year two large e-commerce platforms closed shop in the region, including in Malaysia. In February, Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten announced that it would close its platforms in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia after several years in business. The Catcha Group\\u2019s Ensogo announced in March that it was shutting down its flash deals and marketplace business units in the region, including in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia. Daily deal websites such as Groupon have also been struggling in Malaysia and the region. For now, Malaysia\\u2019s business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce space is dominated by three market leaders \\u2014 Lelong.my, Lazada Malaysia and 11street Malaysia. Lelong.my is a homegrown platform and one of the early movers in Malaysia\\u2019s e-commerce scene. Lazada was founded by German Internet company Rocket Internet and has a presence all over Southeast Asia. China\\u2019s Alibaba Group recently invested US$1 billion in a controlling stake in Lazada, ostensibly to get in on the Asean e-commerce growth story. 11street Malaysia is a joint venture between telecommunications firm Celcom Axiata Bhd and South Korea\\u2019s SK Planet Co Ltd, which operates 11street in its home country. Competition in the e-commerce space has intensified, given the seemingly borderless nature of Internet commerce. Apart from fighting each other and the smaller e-retailers, the big three are in a race of sorts with foreign internet retail giants that Malaysians have access to, including eBay, Amazon, Taobao and other popular retailers outside the country. According to Euromonitor, third-party merchants accounted for a third of internet retail sales in 2015, followed by Amazon with about 14%, though the latter has seen a 2% decline in its share of retail sales value from 2012, as consumers bought from other websites. Apart from internet-based companies, several local companies are jumping on the e-commerce bandwagon. Hong Leong Group\\u2019s GEMFIVE B2C platform opened last May and apparel manufacturer Padini Holdings Bhd recently announced plans for an e-retail site for its own products. Then there are satellite pay-TV provider Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, which started Go Shop in January last year, and media company Media Prima Bhd\\u2019s e-commerce platform CJ WOW Shop. Both\\u00a0 are joint ventures\\u00a0 with\\u00a0 South Korean partners, with the media companies hoping to leverage their existing platforms to push sales. All these different platforms are heating up the competition in the e-commerce landscape on multiple fronts. \\u201cThey are competing for buyers and they are competing for sellers. E-commerce is like that. You need to grab both sides for it to work,\\u201d says an executive with a local e-commerce platform. In a bid to court consumers, internet retail platforms have been furiously dishing out price subsidies \\u2014 often in the form of promo codes, first-time buyer discounts and special flash sales. \\u201cThis means customer acquisition costs are not cheap because you are effectively subsidising customer purchases with your discounts, but that is the way the game goes when you come into the market,\\u201d says the executive. Platforms \\u2014 particularly Lazada and 11street \\u2014 have in the last year significantly ramped up their product offerings almost tenfold to over six million stock keeping units (SKUs) each. Compare this with early 2015, when only Lelong.my had more than one million SKUs, says CLSA in a report on e-commerce. This ramp-up in SKUs could drive accelerated growth in B2C online sales in Malaysia by 20% in 2016, from 15% a year ago, CLSA says. Overall, CLSA is also forecasting that online sales will slowly take a larger share of total sales in Malaysia, from 2.5% in 2015 to 4.1% in 2020. Lazada Malaysia has been working with established brands to bring traditionally offline retailers aboard its platform. It has partnered big brands and renowned retailers \\u2014 including Levi\\u2019s, L\\u2019Or\\u00e9al, Samsung and Nestl\\u00e9 \\u2014 in a bid to increase its range of products. For example, Lazada just launched its \\u201cBrands for All\\u201d campaign that features over 1,000 brands and 55,000 international and local merchants. For Lazada, a B2C platform, this could be a win-win. \\u201cBrands are realising the importance of having an online presence as this equates to a bigger reach and an increase in the number of consumers,\\u201d says Lazada Malaysia CEO Hans-Peter Ressel. A DBS report on e-commerce in Asia concluded that offline retailers in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand are not facing as big a threat from online players as China and Singapore, where retailers are already losing market share. But this is not to be taken for granted. In fact, there is much potential for traditionally offline retailers to use online as another channel to grow sales. DBS warns that department stores and other retailers with relatively lower sales psf are likely to have their business models disrupted in the near future. \\u201cRetail segments that could see some tough competition from pure e-commerce operators include handbag and luggage, cosmetics, home appliances and food products. Retailers selling lifestyle and luxury products, meanwhile, may be more resilient as competition from online merchants is much less aggressive in these areas,\\u201d says DBS in its report. According to Ressel, Lazada is increasingly focusing on consumers living outside the Klang Valley and Kuala Lumpur, areas where people may find it hard to access quality branded products. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve found that 81% of our shoppers reside outside Kuala Lumpur and they often have limited access to quality branded products and shopping malls. This has presented a key opportunity for us to cater for various markets in the country and expand our product offerings. \\u201cConsumers recognise that we provide more than just electronic gadgets. Diapers, stainless steel food containers, digital bathroom scales and even make-up are some of our popular products,\\u201d says Ressel. Since Lazada Malaysia started in 2012, it has seen a huge shift in the demographic of online shoppers toward an older, more diverse group. Today, over 55% of Lazada\\u2019s customers are female and the median age is 30 and above, compared with the early days when most of its shoppers were younger. In a similar vein, 11street Malaysia CEO Hoseok Kim says Malaysia\\u2019s nascent e-commerce market still offers countless opportunities for offline businesses. One opportunity that Kim sees is more local businesses venturing online by applying an omni-channel strategy, operating online and offline businesses concurrently. However, Kim acknowledges that offline sellers and brands in Malaysia are hindered by the lack of knowledge on how to operate online. \\u201cOne of the main challenges is that offline businesses do not know how to start an online business \\u2014 from building a website, setting up payment methods, delivering products, linking sales to inventory management, managing consumer complaints and so on,\\u201d Kim says. 11street\\u2019s strategy to win more shoppers is to embark on a mobile-heavy strategy, grow its product offerings and offer competitive prices. Kim points out that consumers who shop on their personal computers and those who shop via mobile phone have vastly different behaviours. \\u201cOn PCs, most people look for specific things to buy, searching for the products they need. Mobile shoppers mostly do not have anything in particular that they want to buy. They browse to explore what there is, simply because they enjoy shopping. \\u201cFrom this behaviour, we can see that mobile shopping is fast becoming a lifestyle as you can do it anytime, anywhere,\\u201d says Kim. 11street is increasing its focus on mobile shopping by enhancing the user experience via well-curated mobile content among other initiatives. Where, then, does it leave a smaller, new entrant like Astro Go Shop? Its model is slightly different from the other B2C players as it leverages its broadcast and media platforms to sell products via infomercials. Astro Go Shop CEO Grace Lee says the pay-TV provider is banking on its media platforms to reach a potential customer base of about five million households or an average of 20 million individuals. Astro Go Shop has Malay and Chinese language channels in Malaysia that are broadcast around the clock on Astro Pay-TV, Astro on the Go and NJOI, a subscription-based free TV service. It is also leveraging online platforms and Astro Radio stations. \\u201cIn terms of infrastructure, we are able to tap Astro\\u2019s production, broadcasting, customer service, payment gateway and media assets to drive growth and narrow the investment period to achieve profitability quickly,\\u201d says Lee. According to her, Astro Go Shop posted RM189 million in revenue for its FY2015 ended Jan 31 and received orders for over 1.7 million products from January 2015 to July 2016. The next step for Astro Go Shop is to go regional. Plans are to expand to Singapore, in partnership with StarHub Cable Vision, to reach over 500,000 households there. \\u00a0"}, "189": {"date_posted": "25/11/2016", "title": "KLCI to trade sideways as sentiment remains bearish ", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 25): The FBM KLCI is expected to trade sideways today, as sentiment at the local market remains bearish. The local bourse will also remain under pressure given the lack of direction from Wall Street that was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday yesterday. The dollar surged to a near 14-year high before pulling back on Thursday, clocking up records against a range of other top world currencies and skittling emerging markets, according to Reuters. Stronger data from the world's biggest economy had underpinned the greenback's gains, which were further amplified by thinner volumes as U.S. traders stayed away for the Thanksgiving holiday, it said. It was off its highs as Europe wound down but had earlier pushed its way past more of last year's peaks against the euro to reach $1.0515, with only the March 2015 high of $1.0457 standing in the way of a drive towards parity, said Reuters. AllianceDBS Research in its evening edition Thursday said the FBM KLCI had on Nov 24 traded within previous day\\u2019s range to form an inside day bar as market participants chose not to stage an immediate follow through buying interest. It said in the absence of stronger buying and selling interest, the benchmark index was in the red throughout the trading sessions before settling near the day\\u2019s low at 1,624.21 (down 6.17 points 0.38%). \\u201cIn the broader market, losers outnumbered gainers with 452 stocks ending lower and 302 stocks finishing higher. That gave a market breadth of 0.66 indicating the bears were in control,\\u201d it said. AllianceDBS Research said the inside day bar indicated a pause in the game play. It said there were buying attempts to prop up the market in the last 3 market days, but those market participants somehow became cautious when the benchmark index crossed into the 1,630 zone. \\u201cThis can be seen from the inability on the part of the market to sustain its position above the 1,630 level. \\u201cAs such, market participants would likely to continue exchanging their stock positions between 1,637 and 1,617 in a non-trending environment for a little while. \\u201cA shift in market direction from non-trending to trending will be shaping up if the market were to make a higher high. This will subsequently give rise to a higher probability that the resulting short term bullish trend will be stronger,\\u201d it said. \\u00a0 The research house said a crossover of 1,637 could send the market to the next resistance zone, 1,652 \\u2013 1,664, adding that indicator wise, the MACD is still below the 9-day moving average line. \\u201cThe analysis of overall market action on Nov 24 revealed that buying power was weaker than selling pressure. \\u201cAs such, the FBM KLCI would likely trade below the 1,623.61 level on Nov 25,\\u201d said AllianceDBS Research. Based on corporate announcements and news flow yesterday, companies that may be in focus today could include: Genting Bhd, AirAsia Bhd, Magnum Bhd, Aeon Co (M) Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd, KNM Group Bhd, JAKS Resources Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd and Palette Multimedia Bhd."}, "190": {"date_posted": "24/11/2016", "title": "Genting, AirAsia, Magnum, Aeon, IHH, KNM, JAKS, Maybank, Axiata and Palette Multimedia", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 24): Based on corporate announcements and news flow today, companies that may be in focus on Friday (Nov 25) could include: Genting, AirAsia, Magnum, Aeon, IHH, KNM, JAKS, Maybank, Axiata and Palette Multimedia. Genting Bhd saw its net profit rise 60% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM577.21 million or 15.5 sen per share in third quarter ended Sept 30, 2016 (3QFY16) from RM361.09 million or 9.71 sen per share a year ago, mainly due to lower net fair value loss on derivative financial instruments and lower impairment losses. Genting said its revenue grew slightly by 0.8% y-o-y to RM4.683 billion in 3QFY16 compared with RM4.645 billion a year earlier. No interim dividend has been proposed or declared for the quarter. For the nine-month period (9MFY16), Genting's net profit declined 4.5% to RM1.002 billion or 26.96 sen per share from RM1.049 billion or 28.22 sen per share a year before. The group's revenue, however, increased 3.3% to RM13.61 billion from RM13.18 billion a year ago. AirAsia Bhd, which registered its fourth consecutive net profit in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2016 (3QFY16), said bids are coming in for its leasing arm Asia Aviation Capital Ltd, worth some US$1 billion, with eventual sale of the unit to take place in early 2017. This is part of the airline's plans to dispose of non-core businesses. AirAsia group chief executive officer Tan Sri Tony Fernandes revealed that the largest low-cost carrier (LCC) in Asia will also go to the markets with two potential initial public offerings, namely its flight crew training centre AirAsia Academy on Bursa Malaysia and Asean Holding Co on the Hong Kong stock exchange. \"In 2017, we also hope to break ground on new low-cost airports across Asean. We are working closely with local governments to build dedicated facilities for LCCs in a number of cities with the aim of alleviating congestion and driving higher traffic across our network and bring more tourists into these hubs. Once we get the necessary permissions we can deliver a fully operating airport in less than a year,\" he added. The LCC reported a net profit of RM353.89 million or 12.7 sen per share in 3QFY16 compared with a net loss of RM405.73 million or 14.6 sen loss per share in 3QFY15, supported by a 5% y-o-y increase in number of passengers carried to 6.63 million for the three-month period. Revenue rose 11.3% to RM1.69 billion from RM1.52 billion. The airline's revenue per available seat kilometre (RASK) also grew 8% y-o-y to 14.42 sen. For the cumulative nine months (9MFY16), the airline swung to a net profit of RM1.57 billion compared with a net loss of RM13.37 million a year ago, while revenue increased 20.9% to RM5 billion in 9MFY16 from RM4.14 billion in 9MFY15. Magnum Bhd's net profit rose 44.9% to RM55.02 million or 3.87 sen a share in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2016 (3QFY16) from RM37.97 million or 2.67 sen a share a year ago, as prizes payout for its gaming segment was lower in the current quarter. Revenue, however, fell 2% to RM647.19 million in 3QFY16 from RM660.17 million in 3QFY15, on lower gaming sales as a result of intense competition from illegal operators and the weakness in consumer spending. The gaming company declared a third interim dividend of 3 sen per share for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2016 (FY16), payable on Dec 28. This brings total dividends for the year to 10 sen per share. For the cumulative nine months (9MFY16), its net profit dropped 22.7% to RM145.7 million from RM188.56 million a year ago, mainly due to lower profits from the gaming segment. Revenue also fell 3.5% to RM2.03 billion in 9MFY16 from RM2.1 billion in 9MFY15. Aeon Co (M) Bhd's net profit fell sharply by 81.95% to RM5.42 million or 0.39 sen per share in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2016 (3QFY16) from RM30.03 million or 2.14 sen per share a year earlier, on higher operating costs, new store and malls expense and higher interest expense. Revenue for the quarter climbed 2.61% to RM965.34 million from RM940.8 million. For the nine-month period (9MFY16), its net profit declined 44.05% to RM53.2 million from RM95.09 million while its revenue rose 5.59% to RM3.02 billion from RM2.86 billion. Commenting on its prospects, Aeon said the economic and business environment in the final quarter of 2016 (4QFY16) remains challenging with the rising cost of living. \"The group expects its performance for the final quarter of the financial year 2016 to be equally challenging. The group will continue to employ appropriate pricing, high value merchandise assortment, marketing strategies and operational efficiency efforts to ensure that its performance remains creditable,\" it added. IHH Healthcare Bhd's net profit for the third financial quarter ended Sept 30, 2016 (3QFY16) increased by 46.3% to RM173.3 million from RM118.49 million in 3QFY15. This was after foreign exchange losses on Acibadem Holdings non-Turkish Lira borrowings narrowed significantly over the year. Acibadem Holdings refers to IHH's wholly owned Integrated Healthcare Turkey Yatirimlari Ltd Group, which owns 60% of Acibadem Saglik Yatirimlari Holding A.S. Group. Revenue for 3QFY16 came in 18.3% higher at RM2.44 billion from RM2.07 billion a year ago on sustained organic growth at existing hospitals and contribution from new hospitals. Newly acquired assets over the past year \\u2014 Continental and Global Hospitals in India, and Tokuda Group and City Clinic Group in Bulgaria \\u2014 also contributed to the group's revenue growth. For the cumulative nine months ended Sept 30, 2016 (9MFY16), IHH reported a net profit of RM654.86 million, up 26.4% compared to its 9MFY15 net profit of RM518.08 million. Revenue for 9MFY16 was 20% higher at RM7.39 billion versus RM6.16 billion a year ago. KNM Group Bhd's net profit slipped 52.69% to RM1.12 million or 0.05 sen a share in its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2016 (3QFY16) from RM2.36 million or 0.13 sen a share a year ago, due to loss incurred in its Americas segment. Its revenue also fell 10.37% to RM410.65 million from RM458.18 million a year ago. The company said its Americas segment recorded a loss during the period, mainly attributable to low orders secured as a result of uncertainties in oil sand development in North America as well as high project overheads. In addition, it said the group recorded a lower profit before tax for the period due to recognition of a one-off gain from disposal of its Australian operations in the corresponding period last year. For the cumulative nine-month period (9MFY16), its net profit was down 57.04% to RM18.7 million or 0.88 sen per share against RM43.52 million or 2.41 sen per share in the same period last year. However, its 9MFY16 revenue increased by 4.38% to RM1.24 billion compared with RM1.18 billion a year earlier. JAKS Resources Bhd said its net profit jumped 134% to RM13.86 million or 3.16 sen per share for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2016 (3QFY16) from RM5.91 million or 1.35 sen per share in the corresponding quarter last year. The group said its construction division was the main driver of profit growth for the quarter, partly offset by losses in the property development division amid the soft property market. \"The losses incurred were mainly due to the competitive pricing in the property market as well as higher operating and financing expenses after the opening of the EVOLVE mall,\" said JAKS. Revenue for the quarter increased 83% to RM209.12 million from RM114.15 million a year earlier. \"The current quarter's revenue was contributed mainly by the construction division of RM154.7 million, of which RM94.3 million was derived from the Vietnam EPC Construction revenue. \"The property development division contributed RM43.1 million to the group's revenue following the progress billings achieved. The trading and manufacturing divisions generated revenue of RM11.3 million in the quarter under review,\" said the group. For the nine-month cumulative period, net profit doubled y-o-y to RM24.77 million from RM12.25 million, while revenue rose 56% to RM491.05 million from RM314.25 million. Malaysia's biggest lender Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) said on Thursday it had cut its loan growth projection for the current financial year, after posting a drop in third-quarter profit hurt by a higher tax charge. Net profit for July-September was RM1.795 billion (US$402.9 million), 5.4% lower than RM1.898 billion a year earlier. The lender's fourth straight quarterly drop in profit comes amid slowing loan growth at home and exposure to the oil and gas industry that has been hit by falling prices. The group lowered the full-year estimate for loan growth to 2\\u20133% and cut the forecast for return on equity to 10.5\\u201311% due to \"selective asset growth\". \"We are mindful of potential asset quality weakness in a slowing economic growth environment in some of our key operating markets,\" Maybank said in a statement. \"As the group has proactively restructured and rescheduled borrowers' facilities in 1HFY16, the group continues to monitor the impaired status of these loans with the intention of recognising some recoveries in 2HFY16,\" the bank said. It added that it seeks to maintain strong capital levels, well above regulatory requirements. Axiata Group Bhd reported a 71% fall in its third quarter net profit at RM256.56 million from RM891.39 million a year earlier, on higher operating cost. Weaker financials from its Malaysia and Indonesia units also contributed to the group's lower net profit. Mobile-telecommunication network provider Axiata said revenue, however, rose to RM5.46 billion in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2016 (3QFY16) from RM5.06 billion. Axiata said operating cost rose 5.1% to RM3.37 billion from RM3.2 billion. \"Group revenue increased by 7.7% to RM5.46 billion in the current quarter from RM5.07 billion recorded in [the] third quarter of 2015, primarily due to contribution of revenue from Nepal in 3QFY16 and higher revenues in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Cambodia, coupled with a positive translation impact. \"Contribution of Nepal as well as higher profits recorded by Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Cambodia had a positive impact on PAT (profit after tax), which was partly offset by operations in Malaysia and Indonesia that registered lower profits due to intense competition in respective markets and foreign currency fluctuation,\" Axiata said. Cumulative 9MFY16 net profit fell to RM813.75 million from RM2.09 billion a year earlier. Revenue was, however, higher at RM15.78 billion versus RM14.52 billion. Palette Multimedia Bhd plans to diversify into traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to expand its earnings base. Palette Multimedia said it entered into a term sheet for a proposed acquisition of a 51% stake in Genopharma Sdn Bhd (GSB) for RM1.53 million. Palette said it had entered into the term sheet with GSB shareholders Liao Chunhua, Liu Zhen and Tan Yi Wen. \"GSB is principally involved in the trading of TCM, food and herbal supplement. Currently, the products of GSB are being sold at TCM clinics, pharmacies and chain stores. In addition, GSB also supplies herbal based medicines and supplements to hospitals and clinics in Malaysia. \"The proposed acquisition will enable Palette to expand its earnings base and to invest in a profitable business. Hence, the term sheet is to set the parameters of transaction and allow the parties to outline the terms and conditions, as well as their understanding and intention in respect of the proposed acquisition,\" Palette said. \\u00a0"}, "191": {"date_posted": "24/11/2016", "title": "Axiata's 3Q net profit down on weaker Malaysia, Indonesia financials", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 24): Axiata Group Bhd reported a 71% fall in its third quarter net profit at RM256.56 million, from RM891.39 million a year earlier, on higher operating cost.

Within days of the Oct 22 announcement, pundits were speculating that T-Mobile would be the next attractive marriage target for pay-TV or media companies. Even AT&T had been eyeing T-Mobile, but in 2011, it was forced to withdraw its merger bid because of antitrust-related objections. Two years ago, Time Warner turned down 21st Century Fox\\u2019s US$85 a share bid, which was one-fifth lower than today\\u2019s offer of US$107.50 a share in cash and stock. AT&T had already paid US$48.5 billion for satellite-TV provider DirecTV and had been working on its own online video service. AT&T\\u2019s rivals have taken different paths. Verizon, which bought Huffington Post and AOL, looked to the worldwide web as it shelled out US$4.8 billion for Yahoo! Cable and broadband operator Comcast \\u2014 which owns NBC and Universal Studios and recently paid US$3.8 billion for DreamWorks Animation \\u2014 has chosen the tangible consumer businesses and is now seen as a possible suitor for wireless carrier T-Mobile. Hollywood conglomerates 21st Century Fox and Walt Disney Co, which are expected to raise objections to a AT&T-Time Warner marriage, might even make their own M&A moves. Disney, which has repeatedly dismissed talk of buying video streaming service Netflix, owns Pixar, Marvel and ESPN. That convergence is forcing the need for telecoms, media and technology companies to transform is not new. A potential merger between billionaire Ananda Krishnan\\u2019s pay-TV and content behemoth Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd and mobile telecoms operator Maxis Bhd has periodically been the subject of speculation based on their common shareholding and the billionaire\\u2019s deal-making skills. Ananda and his associates control 64.9% of Maxis and 40.98% of Astro. A remarriage of Telekom Malaysia Bhd and Axiata Group Bhd had also been talked about since Telekom added mobile services to its fold with the acquisition of P1. The latter is set to compete with other mobile operators, including Axiata\\u2019s Celcom. Khazanah Nasional Bhd owns 28.7% of Telekom and 37.8% of Axiata. Khazanah also owns 20.7% of Astro, which is why deals involving Telekom and Astro have also been bandied about. Telekom\\u2019s high-speed broadband offering UniFi comes with internet protocol TV, called HyppTV. Some have gone so far as to speculate that Telekom\\u2019s mobile arm could be carved out for Axiata and the rest merged with Astro. \\u201cMuch depends on what the shareholder [Khazanah or Ananda] wants to achieve,\\u201d one seasoned regional telecoms analyst comments. \\u201cIf the shareholder really wanted to do the deal, there will be merits.\\u201d What\\u2019s certain is that Telekom Malaysia is unlikely to be able to change its \\u201cminimum RM700 million or up to 90% of profits\\u201d annual dividend promise, unless it undertakes a deal that significantly changes its value proposition. The company has more than once reiterated its commitment to its dividend promise. What do the CEOs of Malaysia\\u2019s four largest listed telecoms companies have to say when asked whether they expect more M&As here? \\u201cWe are not in a position to comment on M&A trends affecting the Malaysian market. If any were possible, they would most likely occur in the more highly fragmented segments in telco-adjacent markets such as the ICT space. TM itself has no immediate acquisition plans, but we remain vigilant of strategic opportunities should value creation opportunities arise,\\u201d says Telekom group CEO Tan Sri Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa. DiGi.Com Bhd CEO Albern Murty reckons that telcos, in particular, \\u201cmay see acquisitions and strategic bets made into tech startups and digital services companies, which are a lot more aligned to leverage their core business\\u201d. After all, M&A and strategic partnerships are \\u201cways organisations can scale, diversify and innovate quickly\\u201d. Maxis CEO Morten Lundal chose a more politically correct answer: \\u201cOn a global level, telcos have invested in a variety of companies in the last decade or so. We see some choose to acquire content providers, some do acquisitions to provide convergence in access, and others incorporate value chain service experts. There are also those who would incubate new innovations related to the Internet of Things. Others do the old-fashioned thing by acquiring a competitor to gain the advantages of scale. There are many strategies available and I\\u2019m sure many companies are evaluating their positions and options in the light of industry developments affecting them.\\u201d Axiata Group Bhd president and group CEO Tan Sri Jamaludin Ibrahim has said that \\u201cthere will be opportunities\\u201d for consolidation in several markets \\u2014 that is part of a global trend \\u2014 and that Axiata is in a \\u201cgood position\\u201d to participate when opportunities arise. Another official with a telecoms company makes a bolder statement: \\u201cThere are currently five to six players in most of our markets, which we believe is more than what the market can support. The ideal number in each market should be three players, four maximum, like what is seen in most developed countries. The number one and number two players in each market typically enjoy better return on invested capital while it will become increasingly difficult for smaller operators at number three or lower positions to maintain current levels of profitability in the long run.\\u201d If he\\u2019s right, the need for further consolidation will eventually arise.

Intense competition has caused the service revenue of the Big Three \\u2014 DiGi.Com Bhd, Maxis Bhd and Celcom Axiata Bhd \\u2014 to fall 4.6% year on year in the first six months of this year. As a result, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) declined 6.8% y-o-y across the board. It is evident that U Mobile Sdn Bhd will have to be taken seriously as the fourth telecommunication company. As at June 30, the Big Three\\u2019s aggregate subscriber numbers fell 4.6% y-o-y. In a bid to defend their market share, they have started a price war, which ultimately compressed Ebitda margins by between 2 and 4.1 percentage points. U Mobile\\u2019s position was further cemented in late August when the government allocated an additional 2x5MHz band of the 900MHz spectrum and 2x15MHz band of the 1,800MHz spectrum to the company. Adding to the already fierce competition, Telekom Malaysia Bhd is looking to launch its own mobile service, webe, with unlimited data plans at cut-throat prices. Yet, against this backdrop, the share prices of both DiGi.Com and Maxis have been on the climb since May. DiGi rose 17.2% to RM5.20 while Maxis gained 13.7% to RM6. Celcom\\u2019s holding company, Axiata Group Bhd, has bucked the trend. Although its share price also rallied during the same period, it has fallen 14.4% since mid-August to RM5.08, just shy of its 52-week low of RM5.04. It is interesting to note that both DiGi and Maxis have posted slightly higher earnings in the third quarter. DiGi\\u2019s net profit grew 10.3% y-o-y to RM438 million while Maxis\\u2019 expanded by almost 20% to RM503 million. Maxis\\u2019 core net profit, however, rose only 0.8% after adjusting for foreign exchange and accelerated depreciation. Note that Axiata\\u2019s financials have yet to be released. The group usually releases them later than Maxis and DiGi since it needs more time to consolidate the accounts of its foreign operations. DiGi\\u2019s earnings rebound was attributed to a substantial rationalisation of its international direct dialling (IDD) segment. \\u201cAlthough DiGi lost 138,000 prepaid subscribers in 3Q2016, it is quite evident that these are low-quality and/or multi-SIM subscribers as ARPU (average revenue per user) remained flat. Most of the churns are coming from the migrant workers segment, following DiGi\\u2019s decision to move away from the irrational IDD price war and reduce its dependency on voice IDD revenue,\\u201d explains AllianceDBS Research in a report. Overall, DiGi saw subscriber numbers fall by 98,000 or 0.8% quarter on quarter. After three consecutive quarters of growth, this is the first contraction for the group in one year. The good news is that DiGi\\u2019s postpaid subscribers continue to grow, up 2% q-o-q to 1.99 million. However, postpaid revenue fell marginally by 0.6% q-o-q to RM489 million as ARPU moderated to RM80 a month. Meanwhile, prepaid subscribers fell 1.3% q-o-q to 10.26 million. On a more positive note, DiGi\\u2019s prepaid revenue stabilised, marginally unchanged at RM1.06 billion in the quarter despite losing subscribers. DiGi is possibly the telco with a brighter outlook. Having the lowest gearing of 0.4 times net debt-to-Ebitda certainly helps. At the very least, the group will have no problem funding the spectrum reallocation of RM599 million. Nonetheless, there are 11 \\u201csell\\u201d calls on the stock against five \\u201cbuy\\u201d recommendations, according to Bloomberg. There are also 13 \\u201chold\\u201d calls. The average target price is RM4.72 \\u2014 6% lower than DiGi\\u2019s closing price of RM5.02 last week. The outlook for Maxis is less favourable. There are 15 \\u201csell\\u201d and 14 \\u201chold\\u201d calls on Maxis, Bloomberg shows. The average target price is only RM5.43 \\u2014 9.5% below last Wednesday\\u2019s closing of RM6. Most analysts have their reservations on Maxis\\u2019 ability to sustain its dividend per quarter of five sen. The main source of Maxis\\u2019 woes is its high gearing of 1.7 times net debt-to-Ebitda. If the group pays the spectrum fee of RM817 million up front, it will push its gearing up to two times net debt-to-Ebitda by year end. The alternative is to cut dividends, say analysts. As it stands, Maxis is being valued at a dividend yield of 3.3%, assuming dividends are maintained at 20 sen per share. In contrast, DiGi\\u2019s yield is 4.2% and Axiata\\u2019s, 3.4%. A closer look at Maxis\\u2019 third-quarter numbers reveals little indication that the telco will be able to drastically turn around its bottom line. To its credit, the group has been able to defend its Ebitda margins. In fact, they rebounded to 52.8%, five percentage points higher than a year ago. The problem is, Maxis continues to lose subscribers. Its prepaid subscribers fell 1.2% q-o-q to 8.01 million while its postpaid subscribers rose 0.6% to 2.68 million in the quarter. It is the first quarterly growth in postpaid subscribers after nearly five consecutive quarters of contraction. However, the slight increase in postpaid subscribers was dampened by a 1.5% q-o-q fall in postpaid revenue \\u2014 the fourth quarterly decline thus far. \\u201cAlthough the subscriber trend has turned positive, the postpaid segment still posted lower revenue as intense competition pulled down ARPU from RM102 to RM100 in 3Q2016,\\u201d writes AllianceDBS on Maxis. In a nutshell, Maxis users have been using more data but they have not been paying more for it \\u2014 a result of the price war. It remains to be seen how well Celcom will hold up in the third quarter. In past quarters, however, it tended to underperform both Maxis and DiGi. Looking ahead, there is still an upside catalyst for the telcos\\u2019 share prices. An interest rate cut would make the telcos\\u2019 yield relatively more attractive. The last interest rate cut of 25 basis points in May to 3% sparked the current rally in their share prices. Economists are anticipating rate cuts of up to 50 basis points next year, possibly split between the first half and second half of the year. Fortunately for the telcos\\u2019 share prices at least, a falling yield environment will make them relatively more attractive to institutional investors. But that is assuming the telcos can maintain their dividend payouts. \\u00a0"}, "195": {"date_posted": "16/11/2016", "title": "Cover Story: Becoming leaders in digital transformation", "article": " \\u00a0 IT will soon be 10 years since the June 2007 launch of the first iPhone, the smartphone that transformed the telecommunications industry and spurred many new ways we now use our mobile phones. Having fast internet access anytime, anywhere has also come to pass in developed and developing cities where most people constantly have at least one mobile device within their reach. Self-driving cars, washing machines that start operating when the electricity rates are at their cheapest and billboards that differentiate whether you are a man or a woman before showing you gender-specific advertisements are no longer works in progress. Virtual reality headsets already allow people to \\u201ctravel\\u201d and have a 360\\u00b0 view of new places that their physical (and financial) abilities might never take them to. Within the next decade, these innovations and many more could well be commonplace with the right ecosystem in place. Refrigerators that prompt you to buy milk and provide recipe suggestions based on the ingredients you have inside them are several years old in US test environments. With your permission and access to your e-wallet, these fridges can even buy milk and have it delivered in time for your morning coffee or muesli when supply runs out. But digital innovation is not just about making people\\u2019s lives better and creating new ways of doing business. Nor is it just the telecoms and technology industries\\u2019 opportunity to rejuvenate sales and profit as they strive to win and keep customers. What\\u2019s at stake is a country\\u2019s ability to remain competitive as the world undergoes the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which Professor Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum (WEF), says goes beyond automating production and is characterised by the fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital and biological worlds. \\u201cIt is disrupting every industry in every country. And the breadth and depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production, management and governance. \\u201cThe possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity and access to knowledge are unlimited. And these possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage and quantum computing,\\u201d Schwab writes in an op-ed in January, where he also outlined concerns about governments\\u2019 inability to employ and properly regulate these technological advances. Consumers now have new opportunities for work and play, but there is also a need to equip the workforce with new skills, especially those whose jobs are at risk of being taken over by machines. Businesses are also forced to transform: Hotels and taxi companies are finding out quickly with the advent of Airbnb and ride-hailing services like Uber and Grab. Even before that, film and music companies were already contending with online piracy and are today looking for ways to monetise content online. Among the many industry incumbents, at the forefront of the digitisation wave are telecommunication companies that have spent billions the past two decades building the enabling network infrastructure for fast internet connection on the go. They are faced with a quandary, now that mobile phone penetration rates are well above 100% and billions in lucrative long-distance phone calls and text messages are almost history \\u2014 thanks to over-the-top (OTT) applications like WhatsApp, Skype and FaceTime that essentially piggyback on the telecoms network without spending to build them. In 2014, operators around the world reportedly lost US$14 billion in revenue because of a decline in voice and traditional messaging traffic. Already, some experts see phone users having closer ties with the likes of Facebook and Google (think gmail account and your default search engine) rather than telecom operators. Yet, for as long as phones still need to run on the latter\\u2019s networks, the jury is still out. Telcos can stay as a \\u201cdumb pipe\\u201d and continue providing the basic network or be a \\u201csmart pipe\\u201d and build new business advantages to seize growth opportunities in the digital space, including moving into adjacent service industries such as advertising, e-commerce and content delivery. Japan\\u2019s SoftBank Group, which last week committed US$25 billion to a US$100 billion tech investment fund bearing its name, is the earliest and among the most aggressive in Asia. SoftBank is already reaping the benefits of the 32% stake in Alibaba Group it bought 16 years ago for a mere US$20 million. SoftBank still has a 28% stake in Alibaba after it sold US$8 billion worth of the stock recently. Across the Causeway, Singapore Telecommunications Ltd, which in 2012 set aside S$2 billion to ramp up digital investments, has spent more than half that sum to date, including US$321 million for its digital advertising platform Amobee in 2012 and US$770 million for cybersecurity unit Trustwave last year. It also invested in advanced analytics by buying DataSpark, mobile streaming service HOOQ and has a venture capital arm, Innov8, to explore digital innovations. Apart from Trustwave, SingTel\\u2019s \\u201cGroup Digital Life\\u201d investments are still a drag on its profit and are expected to record negative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) of S$150 million to S$180 million for the current year ending March 31, 2017. Still, SingTel\\u2019s FY2015 profit in US dollar terms was still four times that of Malaysia\\u2019s regional telecom operator, Axiata Group Bhd. Similarly, SoftBank\\u2019s was nine times larger \\u2014 allowing both players greater flexibility for sizeable acquisitions. \\u00a0 Balancing investments and returns Axiata has a different strategy: \\u201cWe have to invest in our digital future. There is no question about it \\u2014 we have to do so for the growth and sustainability of our business. Our strategy focuses on integration with existing core business \\u2014 either today or in the future,\\u201d says Tan Sri Jamaludin Ibrahim, Axiata\\u2019s president and CEO. According to him, there are two components to Axiata\\u2019s transformation into a digital company. The first is the digitisation of its core processes such as e-care, real-time marketing analytics and network virtualisation, and these require a change in mindset and the upgrading of digital skills. The second component is to provide new services to expand Axiata\\u2019s core business such as mobile advertising, digital commerce and digital entertainment. \\u201cFortunately, digitisation of the core does not incur huge investments, but it does require a lot of effort. It is critical, and if done well, will even lower our future operating costs. We have started embarking on these initiatives, and in some markets, we are way ahead while in others, we are on a par with our competitors. We plan to be even more aggressive in the future,\\u201d Jamaludin says. He admits that providing new digital services could involve significant investments as well as a long gestation period, depending on the extent and scope. The latter may not sit well with financial investors, who, as experts at Citi Research puts it, \\u201cjustify their investment by dividend yield arbitrage, network investment-driven growth recovery, or a combination of the two\\u201d. Still, these two investment strategies may have passed their peak: \\u201cWe think that monetary policy and industry (technology and regulatory) cyclicality pose long-term fundamental challenges to both stories,\\u201d Citi Research\\u2019s experts write in a recent note. Axiata is looking to balance the need to invest in its digital future and delivering returns to stakeholders as it transforms itself into a new-generation digital company. \\u201cWe strongly believe that we have to do both and are prepared to be \\u2018penalised\\u2019 in the short term. We have a strong conviction of what is best for Axiata\\u2019s future. Fortunately, all investors appreciate and support the digitisation efforts and the need to change to a digital mindset and skill set. And fortunately too, most of our investors support modest, thoughtful and strategically rationalised investments in digital services. We have adopted a modest investment policy to do this and have restricted our digital service investments to 2% to 5% of our total investment each year,\\u201d Jamaludin says. That 2% to 5% works out to RM110 million to RM275 million (US$26 million to US$66 million), based on Axiata\\u2019s FY2016 capital expenditure guidance of RM5.5 billion. If distributed, it would be about one sen to three sen per share \\u2014 an amount that financial investors can probably stomach. So far, Axiata Digital Services had accumulated 28 brands, including its digital commerce ventures in Indonesia and Malaysia \\u2014 elevenia and 11street \\u2014 that collectively generated US$126.6 million gross merchandise value as at end-2015.\\u00a0 As at end-2015, Axiata Digital has focused investments in five key business verticals, namely digital advertising, e-commerce/marketplaces, mobile money, digital entertainment and education, disruptor models and OTT enablement platforms. Elsewhere, Axiata\\u2019s operating units have seen strong usage growth for their mobile money ventures in Cambodia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. Axiata also has experience running a pay-TV service through Dialog TV in Sri Lanka. Among its new ventures in recent years, edotco \\u2014 Axiata\\u2019s tower infrastructure business \\u2014 has piqued investors\\u2019 interest as minimising network duplication is one way to cut cost and increase returns on investments. Malaysia-centric telcos are also investing for the future. \\u201cWe have a solid track record in moving fast and smart ahead of every industry cycle, and have an ambition to take a stronger position in the daily digital lives of our customers,\\u201d DiGi.Com Bhd CEO Albern Murty says, adding that \\u201csignificant\\u201d investments are being made to deliver new digital services to enrich the user experience. In June, Digi-X was set up to create standalone digital businesses, develop new business streams through acquisitions and investments, deepen digital partnerships and footprint in the start-up ecosystem as well as build and monetise digital platforms for the core business. \\u201cThrough [Digi-X], we have invested in a selected few start-ups, made headway and seen more opportunities in the financial services and Internet of Things (IoT) verticals. The deregulation of other industries going forward will also give us the opportunity to offer more M2M services to new customers,\\u201d he says, adding that DiGi also benefits from parent Norwegian Telenor ASA\\u2019s reach in 13 markets as well as investments such as New York-based ad tech company Tapad and Malaysia-based licensed money service business Prabhu Money Transfer. Over at Maxis Bhd, group CEO Morten Lundal says the company \\u201ctook a big step\\u201d towards new ways of working and digitalisation for businesses with its Vodafone partnership. \\u201cBy pairing our local market knowledge and leading high-speed data network with Vodafone\\u2019s Managed IoT connectivity platform, we are now offering enterprises world-leading IoT solutions to create smarter, more efficient businesses,\\u201d Lundal says. \\u201cWe are not basing our future on non-traditional income, we focus on a differentiated high-quality empowerment of our customers by leveraging internet. We will continue to develop our capabilities as we evolve to digitalise Maxis. Relevant to this is our ambition to be the preferred choice for partnership for any world-class solutions or service providers. We welcome all partners with mutual intent and look forward to delivering the best range of choices to our customers.\\u201d Strong initiatives have also been taken by \\u201cconvergence champion\\u201d Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), whose units have been chosen by at least Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB) and Aspen Group to deploy connectivity and IoT smart solutions at selected real estate developments towards delivering that enhanced digital lifestyle for more Malaysians. Its unit, VADS Lyfe Sdn Bhd, for example, is also working with Cyberview Sdn Bhd on an IoT-based traffic-light system in Cyberjaya to help cut waiting time and improve traffic flow. \\u201cTM is poised to promote smart services through the provision of IoT-enabled services and smart solutions for smarter living, smarter businesses, smarter cities, smarter communities and smarter nation, which encompass but not limited to smart safety and security, smart mobility, smart building management and tenant and citizen services. These are in line with our vision, To Make Life and Business Easier for a Better Malaysia. We also leverage our next generation network and ICT solutions to co-create an infrastructure and services that can boost the overall industries in Malaysia,\\u201d says group CEO Tan Sri Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa. Commendable as these efforts are, it remains to be seen whether larger investments need to be made as the leaders of this new age speed ahead in deriving meaningful social and economic impact from new technologies. Malaysia was not among top innovative countries with digital successes \\u2014 Finland, Sweden, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, the US and the Netherlands \\u2014 where the WEF found to have a high rate of business ICT adoption as well as a top innovation environment. Based on the Networked Readiness Index 2016 in the WEF\\u2019s Global Information Technology Report, Malaysia was ranked 31st of 139 (32nd of 143 in 2015) with 4.9 points versus 5.6 to 6 points for the top 15 countries. While Malaysia ranked 21st when it comes to regulatory and business innovation environment, the country ranked 73rd on the \\u201creadiness\\u201d sub-index because we were at No 46 on skills, 71 on infrastructure and 91 on affordability. Within the affordability pillar, Malaysia was ranked 110th on fixed broadband internet tariff and 45th on prepaid mobile tariff but first place when it comes to \\u201cinternet and telephony competition\\u201d.\\u00a0 That could mean more pressure on local operators to provide better services for less money. Will this nudge industry consolidation? (see \\u2018Are conditions ripe for another Malaysian mega merger?\\u2019 on Page 69) Rather than just delivering cheaper price points for consumers, what is needed to push Malaysia ahead is the realisation that holistic change is imperative as laggards will be swept aside.

The market was influenced by the negative performances in the global markets. This came after Republican candidate Donald Trump made a comeback in the election opinion polls led by Democrat Hillary Clinton. The FBM KLCI fell 1.3% in a week to 1,648.24 points, the lowest in four months, last Friday but rebounded to close at 1,663.82 points yesterday. Trading volume remained firm last week, compared with the previous week. The average daily trading volume last week remained at 1.6 billion shares. However, the average trading value increased to RM2.1 billion, compared with RM1.9 billion two weeks ago. This shows that the selling was focused on higher-capped counters. Total market valuation shrank RM23.7 billion from the previous week to RM1,679.9 billion last Friday. Foreign institutions continued their selling last week. Net selling from foreign institutions last week was RM948 million, while net buying from local institutions and retailers were RM898 million and RM50 million respectively. The ringgit slightly weakened against the US dollar from RM4.19 per US dollar to RM4.20 last Friday. Decliners beat gainers two to one in the FBM KLCI. Top gainers for the week were Westports Holdings Bhd (+1.2% in a week to RM4.40), Sime Darby Bhd (+1% to RM8.22) and Genting Malaysia Bhd (+0.9% to RM4.66). Top decliners were CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (-5.2% to RM4.77), SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd (-4.9% to RM1.54) and Axiata Group Bhd (-4.6% to RM4.80). Asian markets were generally bearish except for China. China\\u2019s Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index increased 0.6% in a week to 3,125.08 points last Friday.

US and European markets fell last week as the US prepared to elect a new president. The European markets were more bearish. The US Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.5% in a week to its lowest in four months at 17,888.28 points last Friday. London\\u2019s FTSE 100 Index declined 4.5% in a week to 6,681.92 points and Germany\\u2019s DAX Index shed 4.1% to 10,246.73 points. The US dollar was weaker against major currencies. The US dollar index futures pulled back from 98.3 points to 96.9 points last Friday. This caused gold prices to surge. Commodity Exchange gold increased 2.3% in a week to US$1,305.20 (RM5,481.84) an ounce. However, crude oil (Brent) plunged 8.5% in a week to US$45.60 per barrel. Crude palm oil on Bursa Malaysia was weighed down by lower crude oil prices and its third month futures contract fell 2% in a week to RM2,734 per tonne. The FBM KLCI broke below the support level at 1,650 points and fell to its lowest in four months last Friday, but rebounded as market bargain-hunted as the index tested the support level. The index is still below the short- and long-term 30-day and 200-day moving averages and the Ichimoku Cloud indicator after breaking below these levels last week. The momentum is bearish but weak. The Relative Strength Index and momentum oscillator indicators fell below their mid-levels but are increasing. Furthermore, the moving average convergence divergence indicator is below its moving average. The FBM KLCI is now trading at the bottom band of the Bollinger Bands indicator but is near the middle band. This indicates uncertainty. Furthermore, the FBM KLCI is at the sideways trading range between 1,650 and 1,680 points. The market was generally bearish last week. The uncertainty over who is going to be the next US president caused the market to be cautious, and the market is going to take some time for a correction after the election to evaluate the market reaction. The increase in gold prices indicates that investors are shifting to a safer investment option. Technically, the chart indicates that the market trend is bearish and there is still room for further declines. A breakout below 1,650 points could trigger further selling.

The exercise price of the options is calculated based on a formula that uses a multiple of the Ebitda; a multiple similar to the one used in the initial acquisition,\\u201d edotco Group\\u2019s chief executive officer, Suresh Sidhu, told The Edge Financial Daily. Recall that edotco Group through its wholly-owned subsidiary, edotco Investments (Labuan) Ltd, acquired a 75% stake in edotco Investments Singapore Pte Ltd (formerly known as Digicel Asian Holdings Pte Ltd) from YSH Finance Ltd on Dec 4 last year for US$125 million. This translated into an enterprise value of RM221 million. edotco Singapore wholly owns edotco Myanmar (formerly Digicel Myanmar Tower Company Ltd), while YSH Finance is controlled by Singapore-listed Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd. As part of the acquisition last year, edotco Investments entered into a put and call option agreement with YSH Finance for the sale and purchase of the remaining 25% stake in edotco Singapore. If Axiata fully exercised the call option, it would take full control of edotco Singapore and edotco Myanmar. However, edotco Investments is only exercising half the call options. Note that the put and call option agreement will also be terminated once Axiata completes the acquisition of the 12.5% stake in edotco Singapore. Axiata has the first right of refusal for the remaining 12.5% stake, which will be transacted on a willing buyer, willing seller basis, said Suresh. The option was to expire five years from signing.

The price is not necessarily a good one, the time is not good in the first place. What triggered the rumour was, along the way, we have been asking ourselves, do we need to have 82% ownership in Sri Lanka, 66% in Indonesia, 90% in Cambodia and so on,\" he said.

Net selling from foreign institutions was RM241 million. Decliners beat gainers four to one on the FBM KLCI.

This indicates resistance and the bears are still in control. Furthermore, the index is now nearing the bottom band of the Bollinger Bands indicator and moving average convergence divergence below its moving average. These indicate strong bearish sentiment. There is a high possibility for the FBM KLCI to break below the support level at 1,650 points this week given the stronger bearish momentum, and the next support level it may test is 1,610 points.\\u00a0 Looking at the current developments on the charts, we are probably going to see a bearish market for the next two months and a rebound in the last month for some window dressing.

The disposal of 82 million shares, at RM14.30 per share, raised RM1.17 billion for Khazanah. With TNB\\u2019s share price up by almost 23% y-o-y, Khazanah certainly cannot be faulted for taking profit at these levels. But the timing of the disposal does raise questions about how the funds will be deployed. The 2017 budget will be revealed in a month\\u2019s time, and it is no secret that the federal government is walking a tightrope in keeping the budget deficit at 3.1% this year with the fall in petroleum revenues. Recall that Khazanah last year paid out almost 100% of net profits in dividends \\u2014 a record high. For FY2015, the fund paid dividends of RM1.05 billion against net profit of RM1.055 billion. Post-dividends, Khazanah only retained RM5 million. Keep in mind that Khazanah also had to fund the RM6 billion turnaround of Malaysia Airlinen System Bhd, now known as Malaysia Airlines Bhd (MAB). Against this backdrop, Khazanah\\u2019s borrowings shot up to RM46.46 billion, up 9.54% y-o-y, giving it a net gearing of 1.2 times as at December 2015. Note that this takes into account the fact that Khazanah last year raised RM1.6 billion from the disposal of 112 million TNB shares. Furthermore, it excludes the US$750 million (RM3.15 billion) in US dollar-denominated straight sukuk that was issued in February this year. Khazanah declined to comment for this story. A further cause for concern was the seemingly urgent nature in which the block of 82 million TNB shares were placed out last week. According to industry sources, the shares were placed via an \\u201caccelerated book-building exercise\\u201d. On top of that, the transaction price of RM14.30 was at the low end of the book-building range. It would be worrying if Khazanah was forced to make less-than-ideal disposals in order to maintain dividend payouts.\\u00a0 But to be fair, the TNB shares were disposed of at near-peak prices. Furthermore, Khazanah retains 28.26% equity in TNB worth RM22.9 billion. Beyond TNB, Khazanah\\u2019s holdings in listed companies were estimated to be worth RM89.77 billion as at last Friday. Other than TNB, Khazanah\\u2019s seven listed stocks include Axiata Group Bhd in which it has a 37.77% stake, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (29.81%), IHH Healthcare Bhd (41.12%), UEM Sunrise Bhd (66.06%), Telekom Malaysia Bhd (28.65%) and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) (36.71%). Unlike TNB, however, the rest of the stocks on the portfolio have produced a lacklustre performance this year. MAHB was the only other stock to gain substantially, up 17.6% y-o-y. IHH Healthcare, UEM Sunrise and Telekom all gained less than 3% y-o-y. Meanwhile, CIMB and Axiata lost 5.46% and 12.41% of their market value in the same period. In a nutshell, if Khazanah needs to trim its holdings in its listed companies to raise capital, this is not the right time. Separately, Khazanah has also explored other means to raise fresh capital. At the beginning of the month, it raised US$398.8 million (RM1.62 billion) from the issuance of an exchangeable sukuk for Beijing Enterprises Water Group Ltd \\u2014 an integrated water and sewage treatment solutions service provider in China. To be fair to Khazanah, it does not appear to be milking its companies simply to \\u201cupstream\\u201d the dividends. The clearest example of this is the fact that Axiata reduced its interim dividend by 15%, from eight sen per share to five sen per share (see story on Page 20). It is also important to point out that Khazanah\\u2019s dividend contribution to the government is relatively small compared to the national budget\\u2019s expenditure, which came to RM267 billion for 2016. In contrast to other revenue streams like the Goods and Services Tax, which is expected to rake in RM39 billion this year, Khazanah\\u2019s contribution is also not significant. However, dividends alone may not be the only demand on Khazanah\\u2019s capital. MAB\\u2019s turnaround, while on track, is far from complete and still requires support from Khazanah (see story on Page 28). On top of that, the fund earlier this month announced that it would be developing Taman Tugu \\u2014 a 26.7ha rainforest park that will cost an estimated RM650 million. Note that about RM100 million of that budget is set aside for the maintenance and operation of the park over the next 12 years. Put it all together and it is clear that steering Khazanah is not an enviable task. (Interestingly, Khazanah last week saw a new addition to its board \\u2014 Second Finance Minister Datuk Johari Abdul Ghani.) The fund needs to pay dividends to a cash-strapped shareholder but paying too much could stifle the impressive growth that it has enjoyed over the past decade.\\u00a0 \\u00a0"}, "205": {"date_posted": "4/10/2016", "title": "KLCI rises 0.64% on bargain hunting", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Oct 4): The FBM KLCI rose 0.64% in early trade today on bargain hunting activities, lifted by key blue chips.

Despite the rebound after a positive catalyst from US central bank, the market is still being cautious. The fundamentals are still weak with news of companies laying off workers and the fall of a Korean shipping giant showed how weak the economy currently is. Technically, the market is at a bearish trend resistance level and if the market fails to overcome this resistance, we are going to expect a continuation of the downtrend. The resistance level for the FBM KLCI is at 1,680 points and hence a failure to climb above this level could turn the market bearish again and the FBM KLCI to test the next support level at 1,620 points.

The performance was also in line with market performances in the region. The benchmark FBM KLCI increased 0.9% in a week to 1,686.44 points. However, the index had fallen 1.5% since last Friday to 1,661.39 points yesterday. Trading volume continued to decline last week. The average daily trading volume last week was 1.6 billion shares compared with 1.7 billion shares two weeks ago. The average trading value fell from RM1.9 billion to RM1.8 billion. Local and foreign institutions picked up stocks that retailers sold despite a weaker ringgit. Net buying from local and foreign institutions last week (Monday to Friday) were RM114 million and RM30 million respectively. The ringgit weakened from RM4.08 last week to RM4.10 against the US dollar last Friday, and currently is at RM4.12. Gainers beat decliners four to one on the FBM KLCI.

Markets in both Asia and Europe/US are expected to decline after support levels are broken. The US dollar slightly weakened against major currencies. The US dollar index futures increased from 95.9 points to 95.3 points last Friday. The Commodity Exchange gold price increased only 0.2% to US$1,331.80 (RM5,500.33) an ounce. Crude oil (Brent) snapped a two-week decline and increased 2.2% in a week to US$47.88 per barrel. Crude palm oil on Bursa Malaysia increased 1.6% in a week to RM2,639 per tonne. The FBM KLCI fell\\u00a0 below the long-term 200-day moving average at 1,665 points and also the short-term 30-day moving average just after being supported above it in the past one month. This indicates that the trend has turned bearish. Nevertheless, the market is still being supported well as it is above the Ichimoku Cloud indicator but with the current bearish sentiment, expect the index to fall below the cloud as well. The Relative Strength Index and momentum oscillator fell below their mid-levels and are declining. This indicates that the market sentiment has turned bearish. Furthermore, the bearish trend momentum is strengthening as the FBM KLCI has fallen below the bottom band of the expanding Bollinger Bands and the moving average convergence divergence fell below its mid-level. Last week, I mentioned that the market may still rebound but is still bearish and likely to decline in the short term. The market did rebound, but there is still resistance especially after the pullback last Friday. The immediate resistance for the FBM KLCI is at 1,700 points. Furthermore, the selldown in the US market at the end of last week may trigger selling in the financial markets. Hence, we expect the market to decline in this short trading week and the index to test the immediate support level at 1,650 points. Next week, the market may rebound in the earlier part of the week and if it fails to climb above 1,700 points, then expect further declines in the short term towards 1,600 points.

A 1.3 sen final dividend per share (DPS) was declared, in line with our expectations. For FY16, MyEG is paying a total DPS of 1.8 sen, equivalent to a 30% net dividend payout ratio. On Tuesday evening, MyEG also announced a proposed one-for-two bonus issue, which was a positive surprise. Although the government has not announced any extension of the rehiring programme (registration of illegal foreign workers [IFWs]) since end-June, a check on MyEG\\u2019s website shows that the rehiring programme is ongoing. As at end-June, the company had registered 300,000 IFWs, and in our forecast, we assume that the company will register an additional 700,000 IFWs in FY17. We understand that the government has asked the courts to impose harsher punishments on employers that continue to hire IFWs. Since April, the MyEG-Celcom Axiata Bhd joint venture has started supplying Celcom SIM cards to foreign workers. The average revenue per user (Arpu) is currently RM35. We assume a conservative RM25 Arpu and the company getting 7% of the proceeds in a revenue-sharing scheme with Celcom. We estimate that by 2017/2018, more than two million foreign workers will be holding Celcom SIM cards. MyEG\\u2019s balance sheet was RM102 million net cash or RM4.3 net cash per share as at end-June. Capital expenditure (capex) for Phase 1 of the GST Monitoring Project (GMP) has been completed. We believe that MyEG may need at least another RM300 million for Phase 2 capex, but this should be adequately financed through operational cash flows. MyEG is diversifying into a new business, that of providing hostel accommodation for foreign workers. The first hostel was launched recently in Melaka, and we believe the company is targeting to provide these services nationwide in the next two to three years. The average rental is RM200 per month. The country will have an estimated three million registered foreign workers in 2017, and even if the company can provide accommodation for just 20% of them, annual revenue from this business could hit RM1.4 billion in three years\\u2019 time. We maintain our earnings per share (EPS) forecasts and add new FY19 numbers. In view of the strong 52% three-year EPS compound annual growth rate outlook, we raise our TP from RM2.68 to RM3.22 as we value the stock at a 20% premium to 21 times price-earnings ratio target for the sector for 2017. Rerating catalysts include stronger-than-expected registration of IFWs and a successful launch of the GMP.

TM\\u2019s 72.9%-owned webe services, official launched on Tuesday, will only be available to the public in the fourth quarter of 2016 (4Q16). While not yet available to non-TM customers, the current webe 4G long-term evolution (LTE) plan is priced at RM199/month, excluding the goods and services tax (GST) for the rest of the Malaysian public. Malaysians who are interested to sign up for the webe 4G LTE service may register their interest on the webe website. In our view, webe is likely to offer plans to the public with much lower pricing terms, similar to the offer to its existing subscriber base. Recall that on June 30 this year, webe unveiled its 4G LTE postpaid plan priced at RM79 per month with unlimited Internet data, unlimited calls and SMSes only to existing TM and Packet One Networks (M) Sdn Bhd subscribers. For tethering via the webe mobile plan (using Wi-Fi Hotspot and webe Internet on the computer), an additional RM6 will be charged for two hours, excluding GST. Additional webe lines will also be offered at discounted rates. Given that webe offers unlimited data, the Wi-Fi Hotspot option is offered in case of issues with its data speed and quality as the network currently deploys TMgo\\u2019s 850MHz band while sharing Celcom Axiata Bhd\\u2019s 2G and 3G infrastructure for areas beyond its coverage. At such low prices, it is unlikely for webe to break even in the next few years given that webe\\u2019s losses widened to RM124 million, from RM103 million in fourth quarter financial year 2015 (4QFY15) largely due to accelerated depreciation and impairment for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (Wimax) assets, which will be replaced by LTE equipment. As we expect TM to package its webe offering together with the group\\u2019s other services to provide a solution to customers, the potential cross-subsidies among the group\\u2019s operations are likely to maintain pressure on the its margins. Hence, webe\\u2019s losses are projected to continue but at a slower pace, given that mobile operators such as Maxis Bhd and Celcom will have a head start in offering combination packages. Our channel checks indicate that cellular companies do not expect webe\\u2019s free data option at such low prices to be sustainable in the longer term, when its subscriber base has reached near its competitors\\u2019scale. Hence, we maintain FY16 to FY18 earnings, pending the announcement of its results on Aug 30. The stock\\u2019s FY17 price-earnings ratio of 24 times is near its one-year average of 25 times. \\u2014 AmInvestment Bank, Aug 17"}, "215": {"date_posted": "8/8/2016", "title": "The State of the Nation: Who controls Corporate Malaysia?", "article": " \\u00a0 IS the private sector in the driving seat of Corporate Malaysia? Apparently not, new research by a renowned academic shows, because the government controls a significant portion of it. This may not be immediately obvious but if one considers the sheer weight of involvement by government-linked companies (GLCs) and government-linked investment companies (GLICs) in the Malaysian economy over the decades, it becomes plausible. In his recent research, Universiti Malaya academic Professor Dr Edmund Terence Gomez found that control of the corporate sector is concentrated in the hands of the executive, specifically the prime minister, who is also the finance minister. Gomez arrived at this conclusion in his research of the complex web of control and ownership of Malaysia\\u2019s economy after examining the shareholding structure of seven federal GLICs \\u2014 Minister of Finance Inc (MoF Inc), Khazanah Nasional Bhd, Permodalan Nasional Bhd, the Employees Provident Fund, Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera, Lembaga Tabung Haji and Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (KWAP) \\u2014 and their investments. According to Gomez, the finance minister holds a powerful position as he oversees MoF Inc, which controls a vast empire of companies in strategic sectors, including utility, oil and gas, infrastructure and development finance. \\u201cAs minister of finance, he controls MoF Inc. It is a super entity at the top of the core periphery structure,\\u201d he says. What this means is that the government can exert a strong influence on GLICs and GLCs when it comes to major commercial decisions, including the award of contracts, key appointments, corporate strategy, financing, asset acquisitions and sales. Gomez\\u2019s research outlines seven broad mechanisms via which the government controls the GLICs: legislation, business groups and interlocking stock ownership, control of the financial sector, policies, directorships, golden shares and proxies. He says this is phenomenal because the GLICs hold sway over some RM1 trillion worth of investments. According to his research, the seven GLICs control 35 of the top 100 listed companies in Malaysia whose combined market capitalisation accounts for 42% of the market cap of all the listed companies on Bursa Malaysia.\\u00a0 Many of these companies operate in key sectors of the economy, such as utilities, infrastructure, property and telecommunications. For example, some MoF Inc\\u2019s key assets and investments include Petroliam Nasional Bhd, Khazanah Nasional, UDA Holdings Bhd, Keretapi Tanah Melayu Bhd, MRT Corp Sdn Bhd, Syarikat Prasarana Negara Bhd, SRC International Sdn Bhd as well as several development financial institutions. Khazanah Nasional\\u2019s investments meanwhile include CIMB Group Bhd, UEM Group Bhd, PLUS Malaysia Bhd, Iskandar Investment Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd, \\u00a0Axiata Group Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd, TIME dotCom Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd, Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings and Malaysia Airlines Bhd. The analysis also shows that the seven GLICs have interests in 427 high-value companies either via subsidiary, associate or minority stakes. Ten levels down, the GLICs have exposure to 6,342 companies, and this is just taking into consideration the shareholding of the seven GLICs, their listed companies and their subsidiaries and associates. The analysis at this stage does not include state GLICs. This marks a big departure from corporate control seen in past decades, under past prime ministers, that largely placed control of a huge asset base in the hands of Umno-linked proxies and Umno leaders. \\u201cWho owns Corporate Malaysia today? We had a time when there was a fragmented Umno, when there were many Umno leaders who had a key presence in the corporate sector. They were a source of patronage. They were powerful people who had interests in the corporate sector. \\u201cBut this is not the case today. Now you see a well-integrated executive controlling the corporate sector,\\u201d says Gomez in a recent public lecture entitled \\u201cWho Owns Corporate Malaysia Now? Ownership and Control of GLICs\\u201d. He argues that this new shift has put \\u201cextreme concentration of economic and political control\\u201d in the hands of the prime minister. The story of Corporate Malaysia\\u2019s evolution from a post-independence nation to the present day is not purely one of private enterprise and capitalist endeavours. There are other important, interconnected dynamics at play as well, including economic and social policies and politics. The professor recalls a time in the 1990s which saw the rise of a bumiputera capitalist class that was closely aligned with Umno leaders. This was during the era of Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Tun Daim Zainuddin and Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim. In tracing the broad history of control over the Malaysian economy, Gomez says the 1970s saw a transition from extensive ownership by foreign interests post-independence to the ascendancy of government-owned enterprises in the 1980s. And when Dr Mahathir became prime minister in 1981, he took Malaysia in a completely different direction by going for privatisation and liberalisation with a view of creating a pool of \\u201cbumiputera corporate titans\\u201d, says Gomez. But the plan fell apart around 1997 at the time of the Asian financial crisis. During Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi\\u2019s administration, the Malay capitalist influence on the economy declined and there was a resurgence of GLIC dominance, Gomez points out. So, is government over-intervention a necessary evil or of strategic importance to the Malaysian economy? This has been hotly debated and opinions span the spectrum, from those who favour a free market economy where the government is not directly involved in business to those who favour state intervention in \\u201cstrategic\\u201d sectors. Private-sector entrepreneurs have long bemoaned the presence of the GLCs, which some allege have an unfair advantage when it comes to accessing government contracts, financing and policies. At this point of their research, Gomez and his team have yet to address the outcomes and impact of the GLCs and GLICs on the Malaysian economy. This trend of the government\\u2019s overbearing influence runs contrary to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak\\u2019s earlier pledge that the government will divest the GLCs so that the private sector can return to the driving seat of the economy. Indeed, the government has commenced a plan to divest its interest in some GLCs, either via paring down its stakes, public listing of companies or outright sales. But the slow pace of the divestments calls into question the government\\u2019s sincerity in reducing its direct role in the economy. As at February 2013, less than half of the 33 GLCs had been divested and 24 of them were supposed to have been divested between 2011 and 2012, according to the Asian Development Bank (ADB). An April 2013 paper by ADB sought to answer the oft-asked question: Are government-linked corporations crowding out private investment in Malaysia? ADB concluded that private investment in Malaysia is indeed negatively affected by the dominance of GLCs. \\u201cWe find that when GLCs are dominant in an industry, investment by private firms is significantly negatively impacted. Conversely, when GLCs do not dominate an industry, the impact on private investment is not seen,\\u201d according to the ADB paper by Jayant Menon and Thiam Hee Ng. Private investment in Malaysia \\u2014 domestic or foreign \\u2014 has never fully recovered from the impact of the Asian financial crisis, ADB notes. \\u201cOne explanation put forward in accounting for the sluggish performance of domestic private investment relates to the crowding-out effect as a result of the growing dominance of GLCs in many sectors. \\u201cThe continued pervasiveness of GLCs and their ability to exercise not only significant market power but also to use their special access to government and regulatory agencies to their favour suggests that they may present a formidable barrier to both competition and the entry of new private firms,\\u201d ADB adds."}, "216": {"date_posted": "29/7/2016", "title": "MyEG targeted to register one million IFWs over next six months", "article": " This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on July 29, 2016. \\u00a0 My EG Services Bhd\n(July 28, RM1.96)Maintain add with an increased target price (TP) of RM2.68: We have recently organised a meeting between our institutional clients and My EG Services Bhd\\u2019s (MyEG) management for an update on the company.

In total, Maxis added 480,000 new One Plan subscriptions during the quarter. Postpaid monthly ARPU also remained relatively stable at RM145. \"This wasn't our easiest quarter, where competition tried to improve subscriber market share by lowering prices,\" Maxis chief executive officer Morten Lundal said in a statement. \"After some initial market turbulence, we saw at the closing of the quarter [that] our result improved and we managed to keep our revenue and profit at similar levels, compared to last year,\" he added. He noted that the average mobile internet usage in the last three months has grown to 2.5GB, from 1.7GB. \"For our internet hungry prepaid customers, we offered a very attractive proposition in Hotlink FAST that gives customers Free 2GB of 4G Internet every weekend for life,\" Lundal said. Aside from that, he said Maxis had invested over RM1.3 billion last year and will invest the same amount to improve its operational efficiency to strengthen long-term competitiveness. Maxis said it was the leading LTE or 4G network, which has reached 80% of the population, covering more than 220 cities and towns. During the quarter, Maxis caught itself in the middle of a fierce row with consumers over its offering of significantly cheaper mobile price plans to certain users but not others. This sparked users to switch to rivals Axiata Bhd (operator of Celcom) or DiGi.com Bhd, which offer more competitive price plans. In response to that, Maxis in a news release then, had described the allegation as \"exaggerated\", saying the price plan being mentioned \"does not exist in the way it was described\". Following the social media outcry, Maxis had upgraded over a million customers to plans with a lot more data, which it described as the \"largest auto-upgrade it has ever done\" and largest ever in the country. Shares of Maxis dropped 10 sen or 1.61% to settle at RM6.11 as at midday break today, after 779,400 shares exchanged hands.

Nearly RM7 billion was traded last Tuesday alone when the index fell.\\u00a0 Selling pressure continued to come from foreign institutions. Net selling from foreign institutions was RM1.2 billion and net buyers were local institutions. Local retailers were even. Therefore, the support came from local institutions. The ringgit strengthened after a sharp decline in the US dollar last Friday, but on a week-to-week basis, the ringgit was firm at RM4.09. In the FBM KLCI, decliners beat gainers eight to five.

If you still remember, last week I mentioned that the market would still be in correction as long as the FBM KLCI remained in the sideways support and at resistance levels of between 1,610 and 1,640 points. Technically, the trend is still bearish below the downtrend line and short-term 30-day moving average. However, momentum indicators like the Relative Strength Index and moving average convergence divergence show that market confidence is getting stronger.\\u00a0 The FBM KLCI is below the Ichimoku Cloud indicator, but is currently below a thin cloud. This indicates that the FBM KLCI is set to move into correction after staying sideways for the past one month. Furthermore, the Bollinger Bands have become very narrow, and hence a strong movement is expected if the bottom top band is broken.\\u00a0 The market may rebound or continue its bearish trend and this depends at which level the FBM KLCI breaks. If the index breaks above the resistance level at 1,640 points, then we expect the index to at least test the short- and long-term 30-day and 200-day moving averages at 1,660 points. However, a breakout below the support level at 1,610 points could push the FBM KLCI lower to the next support at 1,510 points. Let\\u2019s see at which level the FBM KLCI breaks, but there is a higher chance for the index to rebound as it is now closer to test the resistance level.

The FBM KLCI technical readings on the chart remained the same as the market was directionless. The trend remained bearish below both the short- and long-term 30-day and 200-day moving averages. The index is also below the Ichimoku Cloud indicator and the widening cloud indicates that there is still strong resistance, at least for another week when the cloud gets thinner. Momentum indicators are still bearish on the FBM KLCI, but they also indicate that the bearish trend has weakened. This indicates that market confidence is strengthening. The Relative Strength Index continued to climb towards its mid-level. The moving average convergence divergence indicator has crossed above its moving average and the FBM KLCI is about to climb above the middle band of the Bollinger Bands indicator. The index has to break above the immediate resistance level at 1,640 points to turn bullish. The thinning Ichimoku Cloud indicator indicates resistance is weakening, and hence there is a high possibility for the index to break above the resistance level. A breakout above this level could bring the FBM KLCI to test the short- and long-term 30-day and 200-day moving averages at 1,660 points. However, if the index fails to break above the resistance level, then expect the market to continue to be directionless in uncertainty.

Oil prices climbed to just shy of US$50 a barrel on Wednesday after a sharper-than-expected fall in crude inventories, lifting energy shares and world stock markets, according to Reuters. Growing bets on a possible Federal Reserve rate increase as early as in June or July reduced demand for U.S. government debt, it said. AllianceDBS Research in its evening edition Wednesday said despite the positive opening note on May 25, the FBM KLCI could only reach a high of 1,631.12 as market participants decided not to play a buying game. It said that in the absence of stronger buying support at 1,631.12, renewed selling pressure chipped in to push the benchmark index down to a low of 1,623.58 before settling near the day\\u2019s high at 1,630.96 (up 5.12 points or 0.31%) in the last few minutes buying of selective blue chip stocks. \\u201cIn the broader market, losers outnumbered gainers with 510 stocks ending lower and 302 stocks finishing higher.

The research house said a fall below 1,620 would put pressure on the market to test the recent low of 1,611 (May 16). It said that conversely, a crossover of 1,637 should lift the market to the next hurdle at 1,652, adding that indicator wise, the MACD is marginally above the 9-day moving average line. \\u201cThe analysis of overall market action on May 25 revealed that buying power was weaker than selling pressure. \\u201cAs such, the FBM KLCI would likely trade below the 1,623.58 level on May 26,\\u201d said AllianceDBS Research.

The average daily trading volume in the past one week was firm at 1.8 billion shares compared to the previous week. The average trading value declined from RM2.1 billion to RM1.9 billion, an indication of more lower-cap stocks being traded.\\u00a0 Foreign institutions continued to exit the market as the ringgit weakened. Net selling from foreign institutions last week was RM1.16 billion and net buying from local institutions was RM1.18 million. Local retailers were the net seller at RM20 million.

Crude palm oil on Bursa Malaysia fell 2.3% in a week to RM2,527 per tonne. Technically, the FBM KLCI remained bearish below both the short- and long-term 30-day and 200-day moving averages. The index is also below the Ichimoku cloud indicator and the widening cloud indicates that there is still strong resistance. The cloud only shrinks in two weeks and based on this indicator, this is when the resistance turns weak. Momentum indicators are still bearish, but are beginning to show a bullish divergence. For the past two weeks, the Relative Strength Index has found support and started to slightly increase. The moving average convergence divergence indicator is about to cross above its moving average. The Bollinger Bands continued to contract, but the FBM KLCI is now moving towards its mid-band, an indication of a weak bearish trend. There is still no reversal despite the FBM KLCI showing that the market is technically oversold. There has been support in the past two weeks despite the selling pressure, but was weak as the market lacked confidence. Chart-wise, there were no clear reversal indications.\\u00a0 After four weeks of declines, the FBM KLCI finally held firm and on the weekly chart, it formed a \\u201cdoji\\u201d Japanese candlesticks chart pattern. This indicates uncertainty. Therefore, there are still no signs of reversal and the only indication we can get is that the bearish trend is weak. However, the candlesticks pattern can turn into a \\u201cMorning Star\\u201d chart pattern if the FBM KLCI closes higher this week. This pattern is a bullish reversal pattern. However, the FBM KLCI may fall to 1,600 points if the index fails to climb higher this week as the trend is still bearish. Benny Lee is chief market strategist for Jupiter Securities Sdn Bhd.

The ringgit was slightly weaker against the US dollar at 3.8980 despite Brent crude rising to US$46.15 per barrel. The FBM KLCI rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (July 2014) and it represents an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cflat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cpseudo-bull\\u201d rise completed. The next few months\\u2019 index price movements since July 2014 comprised key swings of 1,671.82 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,503.68 (low), 1,727.41 (high), 1,600.92 (low) and 1,729.13 (high). The index managed to surpass the key 62% Fibonacci retracement level of 1,728.54 to a recent high of 1,729.13 on April 14, 2016. Some heavier selling at that level had caused the index to decline and move into a downward phase for its 18- and 40-day simple moving averages (SMAs) on its short-term daily chart. The index\\u2019s price bars are between the 50- and 200-day daily SMAs and this depicts a neutral phase for the FBM KLCI in the medium to longer term. The index\\u2019s daily signals are all negative, with its Commodity Channel Index (CCI), Directional Movement Index (DMI), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), oscillator and stochastic indicators all depicting sell signals. As such, the index\\u2019s weaker support levels are seen at 1,600, 1,651 and 1,671, while heavy liquidation at the resistance areas of 1,674, 1,700 and 1,729 may cap the index\\u2019s rise. Due to the weaker tone of the FBM KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201csell\\u201d on BAT.

BAT\\u2019s first quarter of financial year 2016 (1QFY16) results disappointed on a higher-than-expected volume contraction in the domestic market post the excise tax hike in November 2015. Its 1Q domestic market share was down 2.3 percentage points compared with FY15. Amid contraction of industry volumes and some market share, our analyst cut FY16/FY17/FY18 earnings by 16%, 11% and 14% respectively. \\u00a0 BAT\\u2019s chart trend on the daily, weekly and and monthly time frames is firmly down. From a weekly Wave 5 and all-time high of RM69.87 (Decemnber 2014), its prices have turned down strongly on the daily and weekly time frames to a weekly Wave 3 low of RM47.70 (April 2016). BAT has broken a bearish symmetrical triangle, with a very obvious price break below its key support trend line. As prices broke above their recent key critical support levels of RM54.14 and RM52.38, look to sell BAT on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term downtrend for this stock. The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD, oscillator and stochastic) have issued clear sell signals and now show firm and obvious indications of BAT\\u2019s eventual plunge towards much lower levels. It would attract very weak buying activities at the support levels of RM42.77, RM45.48 and RM45.92.

However, CIMB analyst Foong Choong Chen cautioned in a note today that the telco player's outlook remains challenging due to intense competition as Celcom Axiata Bhd strives to regain market share, while Maxis Bhd continues to expand in the migrant workers segment. \"DiGi recorded another quarter of healthy prepaid (an increase of 149,000) and postpaid (an increase of 62,000) net adds, driven by new promotions launched in 1QFY16,\" he said. \"Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin rebounded 1.9% points quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) (a decrease of 0.7% points year-on-year (y-o-y)) to 42.6% in 1QFY16, from its 10-year low in 4QFY15,\" he added. \"However, market competition is likely to remain intense as Celcom strives to regain market share, while Maxis continues to expand in the migrant workers segment.

The decline in profitability was on the back of a 7.7% decline in revenue for the quarter to RM1.65 billion compared to the RM1.79 billion reported in 1QFY15. The group saw service revenue falling 1.8% y-o-y to RM1.56 billion but this was offset by a 6.9% increase in postpaid service revenue. However, the group had incurred higher depreciation and amortisation as well as higher finance costs which offset foreign exchange and derivatives gains of RM9.28 million, as opposed to a loss of RM6.09 million in the previous year.

RISING dividend payments are traditionally equated with balance sheet strength, but the smart investor knows that is not always the case. Some learnt the hard way, having bought into companies that were paying shareholders using future earnings and borrowings instead of just returning excess cash. Others knew some dividend streams were unsustainable but bought the stocks anyway because of their thirst for yield during times of ultra-low interest rates. They helped chased prices of these so-called \\u201cquasi cash cows\\u201d higher but not all escaped with profits when reality dawned. Investors who have wised up are questioning the sustainability of dividends as growth gets tougher to find amid rising costs and industry-wide landscape changes, which threaten future earnings that are needed to fuel continued dividend payments. A stretched balance sheet (read high net debt) is another clue that historical increases in dividend payments are no assurance of dividend payments going forward. Yield stocks remain sought after even as the world grapples with the impact of negative interest rates. And investment premiums have risen considerably, just over seven years after the US Federal Reserve announced its first quantitative easing (QE1) programme in late 2008. In Malaysia, there is added reason to seek safety in dividends. \\u201cAn uptick in political uncertainties\\u201d following Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad\\u2019s resignation from Umno \\u201ccould dampen the ringgit\\u2019s positive momentum\\u201d, UOB Kay Hian Malaysia head of research Vincent Khoo says in a March 2 note. He advises clients to \\u201cstay defensive and focus on dividend yield plays\\u201d. His list of attractive quality high-dividend yielders includes Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank), Hong Leong Industries Bhd, IGB REIT and Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd, with yields ranging from 5.9% to 6.3%. UOB Kay Hian also has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Guinness Anchor Bhd. Meanwhile, Maybank Investment Bank Research tells its clients that 2016 earnings could be down 2% for Guinness Anchor and 2.7% for Carlsberg on the assumption that volumes will contract 0.3% (the same quantum as 2003 when excise duty was raised 10%) due to an expected tax hike on alcohol from March 1. Its report, also dated March 2, forecasts a dividend yield of at least 6% for Carlsberg (\\u201chold\\u201d, RM13 target price) and Guinness Anchor (\\u201cbuy\\u201d, RM15 target price), with no change in expectations \\u201cpending further clarity from management\\u201d. The tax hike, while expected, is one example of how earnings \\u2014 and in turn dividend payments \\u2014 could be affected by operating changes. A quick search found 140 stocks that have above the FBM KLCI\\u2019s 3.4% average yield for 2017 (3.16% for 2016), according to Bloomberg data at the time of writing. Of these, 62 have yields above 5% and these include the five stocks mentioned so far: Maybank (5.85%), Hong Leong Industries (5.61%), IGB REIT (5.62%), Carlsberg (5.87%) and Guinness Anchor (6.46%). The last is among only 30 companies with above 6% yield, Bloomberg data shows. Those familiar with Bloomberg knows it has proprietary analytic functions and limitations. And the yield figures cited here is largely a function of consensus analyst forecasts, coupled with the latest historical reported financial figures, which may not be reflective going forward if the companies\\u2019 balance sheets are stretched or if there is a significant change in operating conditions or inherent competitiveness. That is not to say these figures cannot be relied upon, but rather, that investors need to do a lot more work to be certain that the yields they want will continue to come. Even the \\u201csafe bet\\u201d Telekom Malaysia Bhd \\u2014 the only stock on Bursa Malaysia that has a minimum dividend payout promise of RM700 million or up to 90% of its annual profits \\u2014 is going through a rough patch as it puts its foot back into the mobile business, a segment spun off into the current Axiata Group Bhd in 2009. For now, due to confidence in the dividend promise, yield has compressed to 2.87% at its RM6.63 close last Thursday, assuming its payout falls nearer to RM700 million (19 sen per share) this year. Yield was 3.11% on the same assumptions at its recent low of RM6.10 a share last August. There will be periodic market imperfections, but as the maxim goes, higher gains often come with higher risk. It is worth noting that seven of the 12 stocks with yields of above 7% (according to Bloomberg data) are real estate investment trusts (REITs), which need to pay out over 90% of their earnings as dividends in order to get tax pass-through benefits. Simply put, whatever their real cash needs are, REITs have to pay out 90% of its annual profits to avoid paying corporate tax \\u2014 just one exception to the adage of consistent dividend payers being cash-rich companies. While REITs can provide stable cash flow, they can be faced with a dilemma when their assets age and need refurbishment if costs are higher than their cash reserves \\u2014 one which can lead to asset sales or a rights issue. Business trusts, which do not have a minimum dividend threshold but are allowed to pay them even without having profits, would fall under a similar category of dividend payers that are not necessarily cash rich. Rather than a reward to shareholders, these dividend streams can, at times, be likened to interest payments. To be sure, the well-managed ones can go on for a long time and their chances are higher if the underlying assets are those that can appreciate in value rather than those with a straight-line depreciation with a definitive end-life. But even the latter can provide a learned investor with decent returns in the initial years. Media companies \\u2014 broadcaster and publisher Media Prima Bhd and Star Media Group \\u2014 are also among the stocks with yields of over 7% at the time of writing. Media Prima\\u2019s portfolio contains the country\\u2019s free-to-air TV and radio stations plus three national newspapers \\u2014 New Straits Times, Berita Harian and Harian Metro. Star Media\\u2019s mainstay is The Star English newspaper. The good news is that both companies are still in a net cash position, with the caveat being the challenges the industry is going through as consumption patterns change due to technology and the ubiquitous internet. Both companies, like many others, are reining in overhead costs while investing in new sources of growth. It is worth noting that both Star Media and Media Prima have been paying out at least 50% of profits since FY2011, according to Bloomberg data. While past payment track records may not necessarily reflect ability for future payments, the assumption here is that companies that have consistently been making over 50% payouts and are still in a net cash position or have low net debt, should be able to continue to make generous payments. Others will have to work harder to replenish their cash positions. There are about 40 companies with yields of over 4% that have been paying out at least 50% of their profits as dividends for at least three of the past five fiscal years, a quick search on Bloomberg shows (see table). Of these companies, a number are still in a net cash position while at least eight of them have over two times net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda), according to Bloomberg data. The latter are MRCB-Quill, YTL Corp Bhd, CapitaLand Malaysia Malls Trust, YTL Hospitality REIT, Boustead Holdings and Lingkaran Trans Kota Holdings Bhd. On the other hand, those with more than two times net cash to Ebitda include Bursa Malaysia Bhd, SHL Consolidated Bhd, Star Media, Uchi, Apollo Food Holdings Bhd, Amway Malaysia Bhd and Elsoft Research Bhd. When recently asked for guidance on yield, RHB Research Institute executive chairman and chief economist Lim Chee Sing says investors\\u2019 focus should be on \\u201cstocks with improved business model, reasonable earnings visibility, strong cash flows, a dividend policy put in place and, hence, sustainable dividend payments\\u201d. \\u201cOf course, one cannot ignore valuations as well, as rich valuation stocks are still susceptible to selldowns should global economy take another turn for the worse,\\u201d adds Lim. These words are worth pondering over as one seeks out the right defensive stocks to bolster his portfolio.

The average daily trading volume in the past one week was 1.7 billion shares compared with two billions two weeks ago. The average trading value was firm at RM2.2 billion, a sign of more higher-capped stocks being traded. On the FBM KLCI, gainers beat decliners three to one.

US crude oil (West Texas Intermediate) rose 2.2% in a week to US$39.35 a barrel. Crude palm oil on Bursa Malaysia also rallied and increased 2.8% in a week to RM2,679 per tonne, the highest in nearly two years. We mentioned last week that the market is going to be bullish if the FBM KLCI can stay above 1,700 points and should climb to the next resistance level at 1,740 points. It looks like the market is set to continue trending higher. The FBM KLCI continued to stay above the long-term 200-day moving average and the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. Momentum indicators continued showing that the bullish momentum is strengthening. The relative strength index indicator continued to increase above its mid-level and the moving average convergence divergence indicator above its moving average. The index is also trading at the upper band of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating a very strong bullish momentum. The ringgit is expected to strengthen further and crude oil price movement seems to continue its bullish trend with no signs of weakness. With interest rates remain low, we continue to expect a bullish market this week with the FBM KLCI climbing towards 1,740 points.

The S&P 500 closed at its highest in 2016, leading global stock gains, while the US dollar weakened after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady while lowering expectations for the number of rate hikes this year, according to Reuters. The Fed noted that the US economy continues to face external risks, but indicated that moderate growth would allow it to resume tightening monetary policy this year, it said. AllianceDBS Research in its evening edition Wednesday said despite the weak down close in the preceding day, the FBM KLCI had on March 16 traded within previous day's range to form an inside day bar as market participants chose not to stage an immediate follow through selling pressure. It said that in the absence of stronger selling pressure, the benchmark index was in the green throughout most of the trading sessions before settling at 1,693.43 (up 2.51 points or 0.15%). \"In the broader market, losers outnumbered gainers with 403 stocks ending lower and 380 stocks finishing higher. That gave a market breadth of 0.94 indicating the bears were in control with the bulls closely matched,\" it said. AllianceDBS Research said the non-follow-through selling pressure on March 16 suggested that sellers were playing a conservative game. \"This was reflected in the inside day bar. Judging from the way this market carried itself in recent days, 1,700 level remains a psychological barrier. \"Thus, the benchmark index is expected to confine its trading activity between 1,685 and 1,700 in the coming few days. \"This small consolidation platform should help to pave the way for the market to gear upward again,\" it said. The research house said to overcome the 1,700 level decisively, a stronger dose of buying confidence is necessary. It said a crossover of 1,700 would see next hurdle at 1,710. However, the research house said a downside violation of 1,685 would put pressure on the market down to the next support at 1,675, adding that indicator wise, the MACD was still marginally above the nine-day moving average line. \"The analysis of overall market action on March 16 revealed that buying power was stronger than selling pressure. \"As such, the FBM KLCI would likely trade above the 1,697.26 level on March 17,\" said AllianceDBS Research.

Sapura Resources Bhd announced a divestment of its education business by disposing of its entire shareholding in APIIT Education Group to ILMU Education Group Sdn Bhd, the education arm of government-owned private equity firm Ekuiti Nasional Bhd (Ekuinas), for RM246.99 million. The education assets comprise a 49% interest in APIIT Sdn Bhd, 49% stake in Asia Pacific University Sdn Bhd and 37.61% stake in Asia Pacific Institute of Information Technology Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. The remaining interest in these assets is already owned by ILMU. Sapura Resources is also undertaking a proposed reorganisation, which will involve the disposal by APIIT to ILMU of its entire interest in Asia Pacific Schools Sdn Bhd for RM138.8 million. As a result of the proposed disposals, the group will realise a one-off pro forma gain of about RM192.2 million, based on its audited financial statements ended Jan 31, 2015. Sapura Resources said it is disposing of its education assets as it was more value accretive to the group in the long run to use the funds from the disposal to concentrate on growing its property business, namely its Lot 91 Kuala Lumpur City Centre Development, as well as its aviation business. Mah Sing Group Bhd, the country's third-largest property developer by sales, said it is ready to buy more land after holding back in 2015, as it predicts a rebound in the property sales in the second half of the year. In an interview with Bloomberg, Mah Sing group managing director Tan Sri Leong Hoy Kum said he is seeing signs of renewed confidence from consumers as they move beyond negative reports on the currency and political developments. According to him, the company has a record RM1.4 billion cash pile for land acquisitions. \"We have reached the bottom of a downturn, and it will recover in the medium term,\" Leong said. \"The bad news like 1MDB and the ringgit have already been digested; I don't see any more bad news coming out. It is back to work for everyone to focus on economic growth,\" he added. Top Glove Corp Bhd posted an 86.6% jump in net profit in its second quarter ended Feb 29, 2016 (2QFY16) to RM104.61 million or 8.36 sen per share, driven by its ongoing improvements, which concentrate on enhancing quality, efficiency and profit margins. The world's largest maker of natural rubber gloves said lower raw material prices during the quarter under review also helped lift its earnings. It recorded a net profit of RM56.07 million or 4.51 sen per share in 2QFY15. Revenue for the quarter was up 21.3% at RM693.86 million, from RM572.25 million a year earlier, its bourse filing showed today. For the cumulative six-month period (1HFY16), its net profit more than doubled to RM232.96 million or 18.69 sen per share, as compared to RM104.75 million or 8.43 sen per share a year ago, while cumulative revenue was 30.7% higher at RM1.49 billion versus RM1.14 billion in 1HFY15. Moving forward, Top Glove expects its steady performance to continue, supported by the resilient demand for gloves. Axiata Group Bhd has successfully priced its 10-year US$500 million Sukuk, which will be issued via its wholly-owned Malaysian-incorporated special purpose vehicle, Axiata SPV2 Bhd. The Sukuk Issuance is the third issuance under Axiata's multi-currency Sukuk issuance programme with an aggregate nominal value of US$1.5 billion, established on July 17, 2012. Proceeds of the Sukuk Issuance will be utilised to fund the proposed acquisition of Ncell Pte Ltd. Axiata president and group chief executive officer Datuk Seri Jamaludin Ibrahim said that through Ncell, Axiata will be entering the fast-growing brownfield market of Nepal with a controlling stake of its number one telecom operator. \"As a rare and opportunistic asset, Ncell would be immediately accretive to Axiata's financials when consolidated,\" he added. SMRT Holdings Bhd is teaming up with businessman Datuk Benny Hoe Tze Fook to set up an international school in Cyberjaya. The education and human resources services provider told the stock exchange that it is selling a 90% stake in subsidiary SMR Education Solutions Sdn Bhd (SMRES) to Hoe's company, Brecon Synergy Sdn Bhd, for RM450,000. SMRES won approval from the Education Ministry in November 2014 to establish a private school called Cyberjaya International School. The agreement is subject to, among others, a legal and financial due diligence being carried out by Brecon on the business of SMRES. Kim Teck Cheong Consolidated Bhd (KTC), which was listed on Bursa Malaysia in November last year, is expanding its footprint to Brunei, through the acquisition of a 60% stake in Grantop Marketing Sdn Bhd (GMSB) for B$600,000 or RM1.79 million. It told Bursa Malaysia that the proposed acquisition would potentially provide it with access to approximately 600 sales and distribution points, with the infrastructure in place \\u2014 including warehousing facilities \\u2014 in Brunei. The group has entered into two conditional agreements with various parties for the 60% stake buy in GMSB. The first agreement was entered into with Phang Lee Yen, Lim Sok Lan and Woo Chung Heng, for the shareholders of GMSB to acquire 80,000 shares for B$80,000 (RM238,464). The second agreement was entered into with GMSB, for the subscription of 520,000 new shares for B$520,000 (RM1.55 million). \"This proposed acquisition is an affirmative decision made by the management as a step in executing our plans to further increase our distribution footprint,\" said KTC executive director Dexter Lau. \"Upon a successful acquisition of GMSB, it will be KTC's first business extension outside of East Malaysia,\" he added. Moving forward, Lau said the group's core business focus will still remain in East Malaysia but they will not discount opportunities should it arise. Red Sena Bhd, the country's first food and beverage (F&B) special purpose acquisition company, said it would like to undertake its qualifying acquisition in Thailand, Indonesia or Malaysia. Speaking to pressmen after the company's annual general meeting today, Red Sena chief executive officer Joseph Tan Eng Guan said these three countries offered the greatest potential followed by Vietnam and the Philippines. \"If you look at the population size and F&B business development, you will naturally come to this kind of order as well,\" he said. The company is in the process of identifying and screening potential QAs, he said, adding that it is currently engaging with regional mergers and acquisitions specialists. \\u00a0"}, "243": {"date_posted": "29/2/2016", "title": "MyEG shares see choppy trade ", "article": " This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on February 29, 2016. \\u00a0 KUALA LUMPUR: Shares in My EG Services Bhd (MyEG) saw some choppy trade following news that the government had frozen recruitment of foreign workers.  Its share price is down 7% from its five-year high of RM2.30 on Jan 11. News that the government had decided to suspend the recruitment of all foreign workers to Malaysia as it reviews the current pool of foreign labour in the country sent MyEG\\u2019s share price tumbling nearly 5% to close at RM2.06 on Feb 19 as investors were worried that the freeze would affect the e-government service provider\\u2019s earnings outlook. It closed three sen or 1.39% lower at RM2.13 last Friday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM5.12 billion. Analysts, however, believe that it is a knee-jerk reaction, with CIMB Research advising investors to take this short-term share price weakness as an opportunity to accumulate the stock. \\u201cThe news [of the foreign worker freeze] is negative as investors have been factoring in [the] income stream from higher foreign labour registration via new intakes or the amnesty programme. There could be some follow-through modest selling pressure,\\u201d UOB-Kay Hian head of research Vincent Khoo told The Edge Financial Daily. However, he opined that the negative impact is likely to be temporary, as the suspension will be eventually lifted given Malaysia\\u2019s labour requirement. MyEG on Feb 11 announced that it had been appointed by the home ministry to manage the rehiring programme for illegal foreign workers. This was an enhancement contract to the appointment letter dated Sept 4, 2015. The group had told Bursa Malaysia that this project would take effect from Feb 15 to Aug 15, and was expected to contribute positively to its earnings for the financial years ending June 30, 2016 and 2017. No value was disclosed, as MyEG said \\u201cit is dependent on the number of illegal foreign workers successfully registered\\u201d. \\u201cThere is no official data on the number of illegal workers in Malaysia, but it is believed to be in the range of two million to four million. While the number of illegal workers to be legalised by the government is unclear now, it should not be lesser than the number recorded under the previous 6P programme of 1.3 million workers,\\u201d said Khoo. \\u201cBased on our rough estimate, processing one million illegal workers could lift MyEG\\u2019s revenue by RM100 million,\\u201d he added. Khoo also recognised that the potential contribution from the illegal worker registration is \\u201csignificant\\u201d, estimating that by handling one million illegal worker registrations, net profit could come in at RM50 million (trailing-12-month net profit: RM84 million). As for the courier service licence, he is of the view that the contribution would be small at the beginning stage, but this is a low-hanging fruit for MyEG as it is tapping its existing infrastructure (delivery of road tax) to run this new business. However, Khoo opined that these near-term prospects had already been priced in. \\u201cWe note that there could be other potential earnings growth angles, such as its tie-up with Celcom Axiata Bhd in providing SIM cards to foreign workers. \\u201cMyEG\\u2019s share price would be sustainable should it show its capability in rolling out its new projects on hand,\\u201d Khoo added. He believes that MyEG has thus far shown its ability to clinch contracts and execute its contracts smoothly. \\u201cProspects remain positive. Opportunities lie in its ability to build more value-added services for its growing database of customers,\\u201d he said. For CIMB Research, it believes that investors should take this short-term share price weakness as an opportunity to accumulate MyEG shares. \\u201cPotential rerating catalysts include stronger-than-expected registration of illegal foreign workers and [a] successful launch of the Customs Service Tax Monitoring project in mid-2016,\\u201d it said in a note to clients on Feb 21. MyEG more than doubled its net profit in the first quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (1QFY16) to RM28.5 million from RM12.04 million a year ago, on the back of a 119% increase in revenue to RM60.74 million from RM27.72 million in 1QFY15."}, "244": {"date_posted": "25/2/2016", "title": "KLCI rises higher despite shaky regional markets", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 25): The FBM KLCI rose higher at mid-morning, lifted by key blue chip stocks, despite a shaky start at most regional markets.

Hong Leong IB Research said that in the near term, the FBM KLCI is like to remain choppy and trap in a triangle consolidation (unless it can stage a decisive breakout above downtrend line near 1,700) due to nagging external headwinds and ongoing 4Q15 reporting season. \"Overall, most investors will remain risk-averse pending oil-price stabilisation, more clarity about what the Fed's rate hike path coupled with Chinese currency and economic progress. \"Near-term supports are 1,650-1,622,\"it said. \\u00a0"}, "245": {"date_posted": "24/2/2016", "title": "Government move to raise revenue wipes out RM20b in value of telcos, planters and builders", "article": " This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on February 8 - 14, 2016 \\u00a0  WHAREVER the reason behind the sudden announcement of telecommunications spectrum optimisation and the foreign labour levy hike, the market found it hard to swallow.

Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd (FGV) president and CEO Datuk Mohd Emir Mavani Abdullah, for instance, issued a public appeal asking the government to reconsider its 154% levy hike for foreign estate workers. \\u201cThe sudden move would push the company\\u2019s costs up drastically,\\u201d he said in a Feb 3 statement, pointing out that the palm oil industry as a whole \\u201chas been affected\\u201d by the slump in CPO price to a six-year low last August and a stronger greenback. The Real Estate and Housing Developers\\u2019 Association Malaysia (Rehda) also said they \\u201care totally caught by surprise\\u201d over the sudden announcement. Rehda Malaysia president Datuk Seri FD Iskandar said the 100% hike for construction workers \\u201cwill definitely have adverse effects on the real estate industry\\u201d, which already faces higher costs. \\u201cWe are deeply concerned that such a steep increase would not only negatively impact businesses but ultimately, the unattainable cost increase would be passed down to consumers, thereby hampering the affordable housing agenda,\\u201d he added in a statement, suggesting that the government raise revenue through \\u201cbetter enforcement\\u201d rather than a levy hike. While Malaysia wants to encourage companies to cut dependency on cheap labour and invest in automation to raise productivity, it is impossible, for instance, to expect labour-dependent sectors such as plantations and construction companies to instantly change, experts say.\\u00a0 \\u201cCan Malaysia stay competitive enough for local and foreign investors to invest and stay invested here?\\u201d an observer asks. Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi \\u2014 who announced on Jan 31 that the government expects RM2.5 billion additional income from the 100% to 300% higher restructured levy for foreign workers that came into effect on Feb 1 \\u2014 on Feb 3 reportedly said the government \\u201cwill not hesitate to look into the issue though the new rates are enforced effective Feb 1\\u201d after planters, manufacturers, builders and service sector business groups made strong statements against the move. It is not immediately certain whether the RM2.5 billion mentioned was already included in the revised Budget 2016 assumption, where government revenue was projected to fall RM7.8 billion to RM9.4 billion, largely from oil-related sources, while operating and development expenditure will be cut RM8 billion to RM9.5 billion as the government reduces supplies and services and reprioritises projects. The fees telecoms operators will have to pay the government for their reallocated spectrum blocks are also still unknown at the time of writing, but these have not been included into the revised Budget 2016 assumption. What\\u2019s evident, however, is that Malaysia\\u2019s total market capitalisation was down RM22.3 billion over two days post the levy shock (as at Feb 3) \\u2014 nearly 10 times the RM2.5 billion in extra income the government expects to collect from the revised levy rates \\u2014 before the government signalled room for negotiation. The precipitous value lost due to the cost-related shock could have been avoided with proper consultation with local players. And although Bursa Malaysia\\u2019s total market capitalisation was over RM8 billion higher than before the levy shock as at last Thursday (Feb 4), half of those gains were from Axiata Group Bhd and Maxis Bhd, whose collective market capitalisation on Feb 4 was still RM6.5 billion lower compared to before the revision of Budget 2016. Put another way, total market gains could have been higher had there not been those sudden huge losses for telecoms and plantation stocks. As stock market gains are also seen as a wealth creation factor, a decline implies wealth destruction, an observer says. Stock prices of real estate companies such as S P Setia Bhd, UEM Sunrise Bhd and IOI Properties Bhd were not as badly affected as planters and telcos, collectively falling only about 1.4% or about RM350 million, Bloomberg data show, possibly because the sector was already experiencing slower growth. Large planters such as Sime Darby Bhd, IOI Corp Bhd, Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd, Genting Plantations Bhd and FGV, on the other hand, lost about RM7.8 billion or about 5.5% of market value over two days post the levy hike shock. The largest losers were Malaysia\\u2019s top three mobile operators, which were hit on infrastructure cost, potentially lower customer spending as well as their ability to keep up good dividend payments. Maxis, Axiata (which wholly owns Celcom Axiata) and DiGi collectively coughed up a whopping RM12.7 billion or 9% of their collective market value over two days on Jan 29. Some RM9.5 billion in market capitalisation lost on Jan 28 alone when the government\\u2019s intent to \\u201coptimise revenue from the telecommunications spectrum through a redistribution and bidding process\\u201d was first announced by the prime minister during the Budget 2016 revision. It seems the decline presented a buying opportunity for some investors, possibly one reason for some recovery.\\u00a0 At the time of writing, stock exchange filings show the Employees Provident Fund, for instance, buying DiGi shares on Jan 29 after selling on Jan 27 and 28. The EPF had 14.247% of DiGi as at Jan 29, above the 14.156% it had on Jan 26. Closing at RM4.98 last Thursday, yield was 4.4% based on the lowest FY2016 dividend forecast of 22 sen apiece. The EPF was also a net buyer of Maxis shares on Jan 28 and 29, with its stake at 7.7% as at\\u00a0 Jan 29, compared with 7.57% on Jan 27. For Maxis, implied yield was 3.25% at RM6.15 last Thursday, assuming it pays 20 sen dividend in FY2016. To be sure, the government and Bursa Malaysia are doing their bit to woo investors abroad. Datuk Seri Abdul Wahid Omar, Minister in the Prime Minister\\u2019s Department and head of the Economic Planning Unit, engaged over 80 fund managers with US$15 trillion under management in Hong Kong and Singapore to speak on the growth and competitiveness of Malaysia\\u2019s marketplace through the Invest Malaysia 2016 capital market conversations.

The rebound in crude oil prices and better global market performances helped lift market confidence. However, the market continued to be cautious. The FBM KLCI increased 0.7% in a week to 1,677.28 points yesterday. The ringgit was slightly weaker against the US dollar from RM4.19 to a US dollar a week ago to RM4.20. Trading volume increased slightly in the past one week, compared with the previous week. The average daily trading volume in the past one week was 1.7 billion shares, compared with 1.6 billion shares the week before. The average trading value, however, increased from RM1.7 billion to RM1.9 billion. The market was supported by foreign institutions. Net buying from foreign institutions (from Monday to Friday last week) was RM283 million, while net selling from local institutions and retailers were RM227 million and RM56 million respectively.\\u00a0 For the FBM KLCI, gainers outpaced decliners five to one. The top gainers of the week were IOI Properties Group Bhd (+4.9% in a week), Maxis Bhd (+3.3%) and Axiata Group Bhd (+3.3%). The top decliners were Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd (-5.2%), MISC Bhd (-2.4%) and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (-2.4%). \\u00a0 Asian markets were generally bullish in the past few days. China\\u2019s Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index increased 2.3% in a week to 2,903.95 points. Hong Kong\\u2019s Hang Seng Index rose 1.5% to 19,414.78 points, while Singapore\\u2019s Straits Times Index increased 1.1% to 2,673.76 points. Japan\\u2019s Nikkei 225 was marginally lower from last week at 16,052.05 points. The US and European markets were more bullish than the Asian markets. The US Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 4% in a week to 16,620.66 points on Monday, the highest level since Jan 6. Germany\\u2019s DAX Index also increased 4% in a week to 9,573.59 points, while London\\u2019s FTSE 100 Index rose 3.7% to 6,037.73 points on Monday. The US dollar was stronger against major currencies. The US dollar index increased from 96.7 points a week ago to 97.4 points on Monday. Bullish gold prices were stunted by the stronger US dollar and equity market. Comex gold was marginally lower at US$1,208.90 (RM5,077.38) an ounce, compared with last week. WTI crude increased 5.8% in a week to US$31.48 per barrel. Crude palm oil on Bursa Malaysia pulled back and declined 3.4% in a week to RM2,551 per tonne yesterday. The FBM KLCI stayed above the short-term 30-day moving average after breaking above it two weeks ago, and this indicated that the trend is still bullish in the short term. The index is also above the Ichimoku Cloud indicator, but on a thin cloud. This indicates that the bullish trend is still in an early stage. The FBM KLCI seemed to be struggling to climb above the long-term 200-day moving average. This average, together with the downtrend line (Line R1 on the chart) is currently the technical resistance level, and ranges between 1,680 and 1,690 points. Momentum indicators indicate that the bullish trend is still well supported. The relative strength index indicator is increasing steadily above its mid-level, while the moving average convergence divergence indicator remains above its moving average. Furthermore, the FBM KLCI is still trading near the top band of the Bollinger Bands indicator. However, the bands stopped expanding and this indicates a slightly weaker momentum. The market is in a cautious mode after a rally post Chinese New year. The FBM KLCI is at the 200-day moving average, which has acted as resistance for the index since October 2014. The market may continue to stay in a cautious mode if the index can\\u2019t break above resistance levels between 1,680 and 1,690 points, and we may see a pullback of the index. The immediate support level is at 1,665 points and if this level is broken, we expect the index to fall to the next support level at 1,630 points.

In contrast, the bellwether index rose 12.83 points or 0.77% to 1,677.15 points at the time of writing. RHB Research Institute today said that in what should have been a \"robust year\" for Axiata, its Malaysian unit and single biggest revenue contributor Celcom Axiata Bhd was blighted by stiff competition in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended Dec 31, 2015 (4QFY15). As a result, Celcom lost a net of 260,000 subscribers in the quarter, and service revenue fell 6.8% year-on-year in 4QFY15, and 5.1% for the full year \\u2014 \"the worst among 'The Big 3' operators\". \"We gather there was high churn from the overseas foreign worker (OFW) segment, which is consistent with our earlier view that Maxis Bhd had clawed further share in the OFW market,\" said RHB analysts Wong Cheng Horng and Jeffrey Tan in a note today. They said Axiata's FY15 earnings made up only 89% of its estimates, and 90% consensus. \"Nonetheless, we believe Axiata is heading in the right direction, with non-Malaysian markets making up 63% of revenue, which would give the group exposure to higher growth markets as well as relying less on Celcom,\" said Wong and Tan. For the record, Axiata's 4QFY15 net profit fell 22.03% year-on-year to RM467.24 million for incurring higher depreciation and amortisation charges, paying more interest charges and one-off expenses and taxes. Revenue, however, grew 11.36% to RM5.36 billion in the quarter from RM4.81 billion the year prior. Its full-year profit meanwhile rose 8% to RM2.55 billion or 29.5 sen a share. Axiata's FY15 top-line growth came to 6.26% at RM19.88 billion. Although RHB raised its target price on Axiata to RM6.32 from RM6.29, the research house maintained its \"neutral\" rating. \"While we are positive on its greater exposure to higher growth, non-Malaysian markets, we remain cautious on the potential weakness that Celcom poses,\" said Wong and Tan, citing keener competition with the potential entry of Telekom Malaysia Bhd into the mobile space, and U Mobile Sdn Bhd. \\u00a0"}, "248": {"date_posted": "17/2/2016", "title": "Axiata's FY15 net profit up at RM2.55b, plans 12 sen dividend", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 17): Axiata Group Bhd reported a 22% drop in fourth quarter net profit from a year earlier as the mobile telecommunication network provider registered weaker numbers from its Malaysian and Sri Lanka units. In a statement to Bursa Malaysia today, Axiata said net profit fell to RM467.24 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2015 (4QFY15) from RM599.24 million. Revenue was higher at RM5.36 billion versus RM4.81 billion in 4QFY14. \"Group revenue increased by 11.4% to RM5,360.4 million in the current quarter from RM4,813.4 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 due to higher revenues in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Cambodia and weaker Malaysian ringgit. \"Profit after tax (PAT) in the period decreased by 16.9% to RM515.2 million mainly due to higher depreciation and amortisation charges as well as higher net finance costs, one-off expenses and taxes,\" Axiata said. Axiata's full-year (FY15) net profit rose to RM2.55 billion from RM2.36 billion a year earlier. Revenue was higher at RM19.88 billion compared to RM18.71 billion in FY14. The company plans to pay a dividend of 12 sen a share for 4QFY15, bringing full-year dividends to 20 sen a share. During 4QFY15, Axiata said its Malaysian unit's revenue fell 6.8% on lower voice income. Higher data income, however, mitigated the impact of lower voice revenue. PAT fell 35% due to lower earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, and share of losses from associates. In Sri Lanka, Axiata reported a loss after tax of RM30.1 million, mainly on higher depreciation and amortisation charges besides recognition of one-off levies and taxes. In a separate statement, Axiata president and group chief executive officer Datuk Seri Jamaludin Ibrahim said data investment would stay as a crucial growth factor for Axiata as smartphone usage increased. Jamaludin said its data investment plan came amid anticipation of more competition in the Malaysian, Bangladesh and Cambodian markets. \"As smartphone penetration continues to dominate consumer demand, data and investment in data infrastructure remains a priority in driving significant data growth across all our markets. \"In 2016, the group expects continued and heightened competition in Malaysia, Bangladesh and Cambodia. Other regulatory and market challenges remain, include pricing and fee structure uncertainties as a result of spectrum reallocation in Malaysia,\" Jamaludin said.

The index\\u2019s daily signals are mixed, with its Commodity Channel Index (CCI), Directional Movement Index (DMI), oscillator and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators showing positive signals, while the stochastic is negative. As such, the index\\u2019s support levels are seen at 1,595, 1,618 and 1,638, while heavy profit taking in resistance areas of 1,643, 1,670 and 1,727 will cap any index rebound.

FLB manufactures plywood, wood veneers and laminated veneer lumber. \\u00a0 FLB currently trades at a very low historical price-earnings ratio of 8.1 times, while its price-booking ratio is at a marginally elevated level of 1.45 times. Its return on equity stood at 18.6%. There was no significant news on the stock recently. FLB\\u2019s share price probably fell on the ringgit\\u2019s strength against the US dollar recently. FLB\\u2019s chart trend in the daily time frame is very firmly down. Its share price made an obvious plunge since its major weekly Wave-5 and all-time high of RM3.09 on Jan 11, 2016. Since that RM3.09 high, FLB has fallen to its recent low of RM2.01 this month. As prices broke above their recent key critical support levels of RM2.32 and RM2.69, look to sell FLB on any rallies to its resistance areas, as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to medium-term downtrend for this stock. The daily indicators (like the CCI, DMI, oscillator, stochastic and MACD) have issued clear \\u201csell\\u201d signals, and now show firm and obvious indications of FLB\\u2019s eventual decline towards lower levels. It would attract firm selling activities at resistance levels of RM2.07, RM2.32 and RM2.69. We expect FLB to witness weak buying activities at its support levels of RM1.75, RM1.87 and RM2.01. Its downside targets are located at RM1.98, RM1.64 and RM1.28.  Lee Cheng Hooi is the regional chartist at Maybank Kim Eng.

Brent crude, the standard-bearer for oil prices, fell by 0.84% to US$34.17 per barrel as at writing. \\u201cAs long as oil prices are within this range, it should be fine for us. And crude palm oil (CPO) price is now trading above RM2,500 per tonne, which should be good for plantation counters,\\u201d he said. Evidently, Sime Darby Bhd, Genting Plantations Bhd, United Plantations Bhd and Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd rose by nine sen to 22 sen today. CPO price rose by RM122 or 5.02% to RM2,550 per tonne over the past week. However, Wong said that Malaysia still needs to show further improvement for foreign investors to come back. \\u201cThe sentiment is still fragile, and there are no strong indicators that foreigners are coming back.\\u201d \\u201cEventually, if the ringgit strengthens further, it will eventually attract foreign investors,\\u201d he said. The ringgit today fell 0.2% to 4.1535 against the US dollar. The local currency has strengthened from 4.2525, before Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak announced revisions to Budget 2016 on Jan 28.

Such sentiment augured well for the ringgit as crude oil forms a crucial portion of the Malaysian economy and government revenue. The ringgit strengthened to 4.1452 against the US dollar while the KLCI closed at 1,656.77. Reuters reported that crude oil futures extended gains from the previous session on Thursday as a weaker dollar and unconfirmed talk of producers potentially meeting to discuss output cuts lifted the market despite record US stocks due to overproduction. At Bursa Malaysia, instrumental in the KLCI's gain today were AMMB Holdings Bhd, Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, and DiGi.Com Bhd. Despite the KLCI's gain, analysts were mindful of the sustainability of the index's advance. \"The mid-term outlook (for KLCI) is still bearish. Today's rise was more of a technical rebound,\" Jupiter Securities Sdn Bhd chief market strategist Benny Lee told theedgemarkets.com. \"The gains were mostly because of the rebound in crude oil prices and the ringgit today,\" Lee said.

The U.S. dollar tumbled on Wednesday after comments from a Federal Reserve official and a soft services sector report suggested a slowing pace of rate hikes, sparking a rally in oil prices that also boosted U.S. equities, according to Reuters. U.S. crude settled up 8 percent as the weakness in the dollar helped oil and other commodities priced in the currency. U.S. Treasury yields fell to one-year lows before recovering, it said.

Now, the stock is about 17% below its all-time high recorded in late-February 2015 and twice as many analysts are calling a \\u201csell\\u201d on the stock as the six recommending a \\u201cbuy\\u201d. Twelve others are \\u201cneutral\\u201d, according to Bloomberg data. From early 2015, DiGi has declined nearly 16% \\u2014 twice as much as the bellwether FBM KLCI. By comparison, its larger rival Maxis Bhd has lost less than 4% of its value. So, what gives? More importantly, is it time to reconsider one\\u2019s shopping list? Going by the lowest FY2016 dividend per share (DPS) forecast of 22 sen apiece, yield was 4.26% at DiGi\\u2019s RM5.16 close on Jan 14. The implied yield would be even higher at 4.65% if the DPS assumption was 24 sen \\u2014 which was the projection for FY2015 and is below the FY2016 consensus forecast of 24.7 sen and the 26 sen paid in FY2014. By comparison, yield compressed to below 3% at Telekom Malaysia Bhd, whose much sought-after minimum RM700 million annual dividend promise works out to 18.63 sen at its current share base and 2.85% yield at its RM6.55 close last Thursday. Yields are 3.4% and 3.7% on consensus DPS of 22 sen for FY2015 and 24 sen for FY2016. If one were to assume a 3.5% yield on the lowest dividend forecast of 22 sen, DiGi\\u2019s shares should fetch 22% more at RM6.29 apiece. The upside is over one-third if one were to assume the richer consensus payout of 24.7 sen for FY2016. That DiGi\\u2019s 2015 earnings are likely to come in lower year on year and remain lacklustre in 2016 is a big concern, says a seasoned analyst. \\u201cThe ringgit\\u2019s depreciation has meant more expensive international traffic charges for DiGi and [2015] Ebitda will likely be lower y-o-y.\\u201d Indeed, DiGi\\u2019s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) for the first nine months of FY2015 only made up 72% of what it made in the whole of 2014 while 9MFY2015 net profit fell 8.9% y-o-y to RM1.34 billion. DiGi paid 5.1 sen DPS in 3Q2015, bringing its total dividend for the three quarters to 17.1 sen or RM1.33 billion. The full-year 2015 dividend would be 22.2 sen if DiGi pays 5.1 sen DPS in 4Q2015. Even if one assumed 20 sen DPS for FY2016 \\u2014 the lowest payout per share since 2012 \\u2014 DiGi should fetch 10.7% more at RM5.71 for a 3.5% yield. To be sure, there are valid operational concerns. A quick look at the 3Q2015 numbers for DiGi, Celcom and Maxis shows DiGi lagging behind both Maxis and Celcom in terms of y-o-y financial performance. Maxis was in the lead in terms of revenue, Ebitda and Ebitda margins as well as subscriber base. Some 85% of DiGi\\u2019s 11.7 million subscribers are in the prepaid segment, which is perceived to be more price-sensitive than the postpaid segment. This is larger than the 75.8% at Maxis and 77.6% at Celcom. This is why any movement in the prepaid segment, which could be hit by weak consumer sentiment, is seen to have a bigger impact on DiGi. It is worth noting that with 9.93 million prepaid users, Maxis has slightly more of them than DiGi\\u2019s 9.9 million and Celcom\\u2019s 9.71 million as at Sept 30, 2015. A Maxis user also pays an average of RM49 a month \\u2014 higher than RM45 a month at DiGi and Celcom. The trio account for some 85% of Malaysia\\u2019s total mobile subscriber base. Yet, based on 3Q2015 numbers, DiGi has more flexibility in balance sheet capacity. Its net debt to Ebitda is only 0.32 times currently, even with lower Ebitda assumptions this year, back-of-the-envelope calculations show. Maxis\\u2019 net debt to Ebitda multiple is about 1.8 times, Telekom Malaysia\\u2019s (TM) is 0.8 times while Celcom\\u2019s parent Axiata Group Bhd\\u2019s is between 1.5 and 2 times following its Nepalese acquisition, which it said would add to its dividend paying capacity. If nothing else, these figures give DiGi the option to maintain dividends even as it works out a strategy to win more earnings and boost margins. At the time of writing, Bloomberg shows target prices for DiGi ranging from JP Morgan\\u2019s RM4.20 to BIMB Securities\\u2019 RM6.80 and averaging at RM5.33 apiece. If DiGi can pay the consensus DPS of 24.7 sen for 2016, its shares should fetch RM7.06, assuming a 3.5% yield. If DPS is only 20 sen for 2016, DiGi would fetch RM6.67, assuming a 3% yield. There are those who reckon that Norway\\u2019s Telenor ASA \\u2014 which owns 49% of DiGi and previously considered adopting a business trust structure for the latter to release more cash \\u2014 may have less of an incentive for a large payout when the ringgit is weak. There is also concern that DiGi, which paid more than its rivals for its 3G spectrum, may face similar circumstances should regulators call for a spectrum re-farming in the coming three to five years. In the meantime, investors would need to \\u201ccurrency-adjust\\u201d their expected returns based on their assumption of the ringgit. Still, it is worth noting that the Employees Provident Fund and its portfolio managers were net buyers of DiGi, Maxis, TM and Axiata shares last year. Between end-2015 and now, stock exchange filings show that the EPF continued to buy DiGi and Axiata but took profit in Maxis on Jan 12 and in TM on Jan 11. The EPF still held 16.23% of TM (14.73% at end-2014), 14.55% of Axiata (13.54% at end-2014), 14.13% of DiGi (13.27% at end-2014) and 7.45% of Maxis (6.46% at end-2014) at the time of writing. The holdings of these four stocks alone could potentially rake in RM720 million to RM880 million in dividends this year or about 13% of the RM5.6 billion to RM7 billion that DiGi, Maxis, Axiata and TM are projected to pay this year. That\\u2019s important, given that the EPF needed RM5.41 billion to pay every 1% of dividend in 2014, up from RM4.91 billion in 2013. This figure is likely to have grown for 2015 \\u2014 not that different from the average investor who will be hard-pressed to make bigger returns from every ringgit. From a yield perspective, DiGi seems a rational choice unless its operational numbers deteriorate significantly from current levels. DiGi, which has been paying quarterly dividends since 2010, is slated to announce its full-year earnings for 2015 on Feb 5. \\u00a0"}, "258": {"date_posted": "3/2/2016", "title": "Market may continue to stay buoyant", "article": " This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on February 3, 2016. \\u00a0  The market staged a technical rebound last week as I had expected.

The Bank of Japan\\u2019s decision to have negative interest rates shows that it does not want people to keep in banks, and hopefully to channel their money into investments. The local market performance was in line with regional market performance. The benchmark FBM KLCI increased 1.6% in a week to 1,653.18 points yesterday. Plantation and energy stocks led, while telecommunications weighed down the market. The ringgit strengthened against the US dollar from RM4.25 to a US dollar a week ago to RM4.21.\\u00a0 Trading volume declined last week as the market stayed cautious. The average daily trading volume in the past week was 1.9 billion shares compared with 2.1 billion shares two weeks ago. However, the average trading value rose from RM2 billion to RM2.7 billion, and this indicates more higher-capped stocks were being traded and foreign institutions reversed their selling spree. Foreign institutions started accumulating after many weeks of selling on a stronger ringgit.

Japan\\u2019s Nikkei 225 jumped 6.2% in a week to 17,750.68 points. Markets in the United States and Europe continued to increase last week after a rebound two weeks ago. The US Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 3.6% in a week to 16,449.18 points on Monday. Also on Monday, Germany\\u2019s DAX Index increased only 0.2% in a week to 9,757.88 points and London\\u2019s FTSE 100 Index increased 3.1% in a week to 6,057.1 points.\\u00a0 The US Dollar Index weakened slightly in the past week from 99.4 points to 99 points on Monday. Commodity Exchange gold remained bullish and increased 1.8% in a week to US$1,128.60 an ounce. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 5% in a week to US$31.32 per barrel. Crude palm oil in Bursa Malaysia increased 1.6% in a week to RM2,514 per tonne yesterday. The FBM KLCI rose above the short-term 30-day moving average after last week\\u2019s increase. This indicates that the index is bullish in the short term. However, the index is still below the long-term 200-day moving average and the downtrend line (R1 on the chart). Furthermore, the index is still not able to climb above the Ichimoku Cloud. The resistance, based on the downtrend line and the 200-day moving average, is at 1,690 points. Momentum indicators are starting to show that market sentiment is turning bullish. The Relative Strength Index and momentum oscillator indicators increase above their mid-levels, and the moving average convergence divergence crossed above its moving average. However, the Bollinger Bands continued to squeeze and the FBM KLCI was not able to climb to the top band of the Bollinger Bands. Market momentum is bullish in the short term. However, it has to overcome the resistance level at 1,690 points to boost market confidence. With the resistance, we expect the market to be buoyant this week, staying at levels between 1,650 and 1,690 points. I guess this will be the Chinese New Year rally.

According to Nomura, although the government has announced the telecommunication spectrum redistribution via a bidding process, these events have yet to happen. \"With the latest telco developments in Malaysia, Thailand and elsewhere in Asean, it is not easy to pitch many stocks. Many of these stocks have corrected 10% to 30% in recent months and are trading at low-teens P/E, something we haven't seen in a while, with yields of 6% to 8% (assuming our forecasts are right). \"But we don't think this alone will see a re-rating. A lot of the arguments (even ours) on 'it is in the price' are based on scenario-analysis \\u2014 but many of these events around 'spectrum, auctions or new entrants' are yet to unfold, so this doesn't give much comfort or conviction even,\" Nomura said.

It is of the view the move will negatively impact local telcos. The rating agency said the extent of the impact will depend on pending further details on this latest move by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), including the spectrums which are to be redistributed or auctioned, pricing methodology and bidding process. \"Key players that fail to retain their existing spectrum holdings could see the degradation of their network coverage,\" it added, noting that Malaysia\\u2019s telco sector is currently dominated by three players, namely Maxis Bhd, Celcom Axiata Bhd and Digi.Com Bhd. RAM, however, sees the redistribution of telecommunications spectrums via bidding process could result in greater opportunities for smaller telcos to gain stronger footholds in the industry via an increase in spectrum holdings, further intensifying competition between players. The rating agency noted that Maxis\\u2019 debt load has increased over the years, given its hefty capital expenditure requirements and dividend payouts. As at end-September 2015, Maxis\\u2019 adjusted gearing ratio stood at 2.42 times, while the total debt of the group came up to RM15 billion. \"Hence, potential excessive leveraging by Maxis could reduce its ability to support the group\\u2019s debt-servicing ability,\" said RAM. Maxis shares closed 46 sen or 7.44% lower at RM5.72 today, bringing it to a market capitalisation of RM42.96 billion.

Property developer Tropicana Corp Bhd, controlled by tycoon Tan Sri Danny Tan, is disposing of the Dijaya Plaza office building at Jalan Tun Razak here to Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd for RM140 million cash, which will be used for working capital and/or to repay borrowings. In a statement, Tropicana said the asset sale comprises a piece of freehold land measuring approximately 3,674 sq m, together with an en-bloc 19-storey office tower with two levels of basement car park containing 322 parking bays. The building is approximately four years old. The building, with a total net lettable area of 156,488 sq ft, is currently 70% occupied.

In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Pintaras Jaya said the contract, to be completed in 14 months, is to provide earthworks, piling and sub-structure works for Central Tower Project in i-City, Shah Alam. Packet One Networks (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (P1), a subsidiary of Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), will soon be able to provide domestic roaming services via a collaboration with Celcom Axiata Bhd.

National utility company Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) saw its net profit fall 16% to RM1.98 billion or 35.01 sen per share for the first quarter ended Nov 30, 2015 (1QFY16), from RM2.35 billion or 41.67 sen per share in the previous year, due to the recognition of the imbalance cost pass through (ICPT) and foreign exchange translation loss. Revenue for the quarter was 3% lower at RM10.68 billion compared to RM11.03 billion a year earlier, its bourse filing today showed. The group noted that the reduction in profit is mainly due to the recognition of ICPT in the current reporting period and the strengthening of the US dollar and Japanese yen against the ringgit. Meanwhile, TNB said the sales of electricity for the period rose 3.9% to RM11.18 billion from RM10.76 billion, mainly due to a 3.6% sales increase in Peninsular Malaysia electricity sales. Glove formers maker ES Ceramics Technology Bhd saw its net profit for the second quarter ended Nov 30, 2015 (2QFY16) jump 32% to RM1.83 million or 0.9 sen per share from RM1.39 million or 0.7 sen per share a year ago, in tandem with the increase in revenue. Revenue for 2QFY16 grew 7% to RM7.66 million from RM7.14 million in 2QFY15. For the half year of FY16 (1HFY16), ES Ceramics' net profit climbed 31.4% to RM3.3 million or 1.6 sen per share, from RM2.5 million or 1.3 sen per share in the previous year, helped by continuous cost improvement, better product mix and higher output volume. Cumulative revenue came in 7.9% higher at RM14.3 million compared with RM13.3 million in 1HFY15. The country's sole tin plate manufacturer Perusahaan Sadur Timah Malaysia Bhd (Perstima) saw its net profit for the third financial quarter ended Dec 31, 2015 (3QFY16) jump 26% to RM14.33 million from RM11.4 million a year ago, on higher sales volume despite lower selling price. Revenue for 3QFY16 increased 25.4% to RM208.72 million from RM166.39 million in 3QFY15. For the cumulative nine months ended Dec 31, 2015 (9MFY16), net profit surged 50.6% to RM37.72 million from RM25.04 million a year ago.

Revenue rose 13.43% to RM65.62 million, from RM57.85 million, mainly due to higher sales of bottled water products and packaging materials, and better average selling prices. For the six months ended Nov 30, 2015 (1HFY16), Spritzer's net profit was at RM14.7 million or 10.16 sen per share, up 45.11% from RM10.13 million or 7.38 sen per share a year ago. 1HFY16's revenue rose 10.03% to RM132.28 million, from RM120.22 million. Semiconductor company Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd (MPI) saw its net profit for the second quarter ended Dec 31, 2015 (2QFY16) soar 36.9% to RM32.93 million or 17.34 sen per share, due to wider margin products, stronger US dollar and lower material cost. It posted a net profit of RM24.06 million or 12.67 sen per share in the previous corresponding quarter. Quarterly revenue grew 12.23% to RM379.69 million, from RM338.29 million in 2QFY16, mainly driven by revenue growth from Asia, the US and Europe. For the half year of FY16 (1HFY16), MPI's net profit surged 81.6% to RM79.85 million or 42.04 sen per share, from RM43.97 million or 23.16 sen per share last year, helped by the firm US dollar and wider profit margin. Cumulative revenue came in 15.06% higher at RM766.34 million, against RM666.01 million in 1HFY15. Moving forward, MPI expects the operating environment to remain challenging, as the semiconductor industry is experiencing slower growth, coupled with uncertainty in the macro economy. Furniture manufacturer Homeritz Corp Bhd registered a net profit of RM8.89 million for the first quarter ended Nov 30, 2015 (1QFY16), double the RM4.26 million seen a year ago, due to higher sales and the stronger US dollar. Earnings per share stood at 2.96 sen, compared to 1.42 sen a year earlier. Revenue grew 21.88% to RM40.67 million from RM33.37 million in 1QFY15. Announcing its financial results to Bursa Malaysia today, Homeritz said it is operating in global economic uncertainties as well as facing increases in raw materials costs and fluctuation in foreign exchange rates. Given the above scenario, the group will continue to remain focused in its core business of design, manufacture, and sale of upholstered home furniture. Palm oil cultivator Chin Teck Plantations Bhd expects to register smaller profits in the near term due to its ongoing oil palm replanting activities and losses incurred by its Indonesian associate, assuming crude palm oil (CPO) prices remain weak. Its executive vice chairman Goh Wei Lei said today that over 40% of the group's oil palm plantations now are aged above 21 years. Chin Teck has oil palm estates in Pahang, Kelantan and Negeri Sembilan, with a total 11,327 ha of planted land area. It has replanted 846 ha or 7.5% of its oil palms in 2015, and plans to replant 960 ha or 8.5% more this year. Goh, who was speaking to reporters today after the group's annual general meeting, also attributed Chin Teck's weaker earnings recently to CPO prices, which have been relatively weak in the past two years. WZ Satu Bhd, which has an exclusive mining contract to mine bauxite ore in Kuantan, aims to match the last financial year's profit for its mining segment in the current financial year ending Aug 31, 2016 (FY16), driven by improved productivity post-moratorium. Its chief executive officer Tengku Datuk Seri Uzir Ubaidillah said although the three-month ban on production will affect the group negatively in the short term, due to operational costs in terms of idle machines and manpower, WZ Satu is confident that it will be able to recoup the lost revenue through increased productivity after the moratorium. At a press conference after the group's annual general meeting today, Uzir said he believes that this three-month moratorium would be beneficial for WZ Satu because it would weed out the ones that are non-conforming to regulations. Once WZ Satu is allowed to continue production and sales in April, Uzir said he hopes the group can recover the loss in these three months by being more productive. Practice Note 16 (PN16) company Kejuruteraan Samudra Timur Bhd (KSTB) is proposing a regularisation plan that will pave the way for the company to venture into power generation in Sabah, a capital repayment, followed by a management buyout. In a bourse filing, KSTB and the substantial shareholders of Sepangar Bay Power Corporation Sdn Bhd (SBPC) - have agreed to negotiate the proposed acquisition of SBPC with the intention to finalise and enter into definitive agreements within 60 days. SBPC has been granted the right to construct, own and operate a 100-MW combined-cycle gas turbine power plant in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, under a power purchase agreement with Sabah Electricity Sdn Bhd, which expires on Aug 11, 2029. KSTB also plans to distribute substantially the cash it retained through either a capital reduction exercise or a combination of capital reduction and dividend payment to reward existing shareholders. To facilitate the capital repayment, KSTB may undertake a proposed bonus issue of new ordinary shares of 30 sen each. KSTB then intends to set up a new private limited company (NewCo) to acquire the entire issued and paid-up share capital of KSTB from its shareholders by way of a share exchange exercise. The NewCo shall then buy up SBPC \\u2014 at a price to be fixed \\u2014 with the issuance of new shares. KSTB shall concurrently transfer its listing status to the NewCo after it has been converted into a public company. There would be a proposed management buyout of all the equity interest in KSTB by the current management of KSTB, which is headed by Darmendran Kunaretnam and Chee Cheng Chun, after the relevant proposals are carried out.

The MoA comprises a supplemental agreement on the high-speed broadband (HSBB) service agreement between TM and Celcom Mobile, and a supplemental agreement on the wholesale bandwidth services agreement between TM and Celcom.

U Mobile is, today, the fourth largest mobile operator in Malaysia, with a market share of close to 8%. Wong says it is aiming for a double-digit market share in the coming years, which should help it build its profit track record, or at least, break even. \\u201cEbitda positive is a key milestone for us before we do the IPO, because that will give investors confidence,\\u201d he says. However, he declines to reveal U Mobile\\u2019s Ebitda figures. A quick check on the Companies Commission of Malaysia\\u2019s website shows that U Mobile\\u2019s net loss contracted to RM191.82 million in its financial year ended Dec 31, 2014 (FY2014) from RM363.24 million in FY2013. Revenue rose from RM919.17 million to RM1.26 billion. U Mobile has allocated a capital expenditure (capex) of RM3 billion to RM4 billion for its five-year expansion plan, mainly to expand its third generation (3G) and fourth generation long-term evolution (4G LTE) network infrastructure by rolling out 5,000 new base stations to cover the whole country. To date, it owns 3,200 network sites for 3G and 1,281 sites for 4G. It also has 1,880 network sites for 3G that are shared with Maxis.  \\u201cWe are not going for a listing for the sake of going for a listing. Yes, our [current] shareholders are a source of funds, but eventually, we need multiple sources of funds,\\u201d he says. He adds that the most efficient way to raise funds is through a combination of capital market, equity market and loan market. In order to tap these sources of funds, the best way is to go for a listing. \\u201cA telco is like a utility firm. Investment in technology is a must; the day the telco stops investing is the day it dies,\\u201d he explains. While it is still too early to tell how big the IPO will be, Wong acknowledges that the five-year capex plan will tap into the IPO funds. \\u201cMaybe 25% to 30% will be fresh funds coming from the equity market. Once we go for a listing, we can have a series of bond and loan [issuance].\\u201d On U Mobile\\u2019s listing destination, he says the priority is Bursa Malaysia. However, he did not rule out the possibility of floating its shares on other stock exchanges, including Singapore and Jakarta, as well as a primary listing in Shanghai, China, and a secondary listing in Kuala Lumpur. \\u201cIf you look at the regional\\u00a0bourses today, Malaysia has the best valuation for telcos, be it Ebitda multiple or price-earnings ratio. But three years later, I wouldn\\u2019t know,\\u201d he says. Currently, Straits Mobile Investments Pte Ltd, a unit of Singapore Technologies Telemedia, is the single largest shareholder of U Mobile with a 49% stake. U Telemedia Sdn Bhd, a private investment by local tycoon Tan Sri Vincent Tan Chee Yioun, is the second largest shareholder with a 21.46% stake. Tan, who is the chairman of U Mobile, also has a 6.2% direct stake in U Mobile as well as 2.01% equity interest via Berjaya Infrastructure Sdn Bhd. It is worth noting that U Mobile on Dec 18 announced that Sultan of Johor Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar has acquired an additional 5% stake in the company, raising his holding to 15%. Sultan Ibrahim acquired his initial 10% stake in U Mobile in 2014. Locally listed Magnum Bhd also has a 6.33% stake in U Mobile.

The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) has raised a red flag over the conduct of Nexgram Holdings Bhd, in disposing of three of its subsidiaries. In a statement today, the SC said it has come to the regulator's attention that Nexgram, which is making a voluntary takeover offer for the securities of Ire-Tex Corp Bhd via a share-swap arrangement, entered into agreements this month to dispose of three of its subsidiaries. The three subsidiaries are Nexgram Resources Sdn Bhd, Godynamic Investments Ltd and PT Semesta Tirta Antara Raya (Indonesia). The SC said Bursa Malaysia is seeking verification from Nexgram on the existence of certain assets belonging to the subsidiaries. They are also being investigated by the SC in relation to the accuracy of information disclosed in the offer document despatched to Ire-Tex shareholders, it said. Hence, it said Nexgram's disposal of the subsidiaries, delays and obstructs SC and Bursa Malaysia's on-going enquiries. The outcome of the enquiries may impact the value of Nexgram shares, which Ire-Tex shareholders are to receive in exchange for accepting the voluntary offer, it warned.

Rachmadsyah said MoodMusic was one of the products and services that XL had intended to launch this year, to improve its average revenue per user (ARPU). \"It's the digital era.

Describing 2015 as a \\u201croller coaster\\u201d year, Khazanah managing director Tan Sri Azman Mokhtar said the falling value of the ringgit, which was among the world\\u2019s worst-performing currencies last year, was partly to be blamed for the lower NWA. The fund\\u2019s realisable asset value (RAV), however, rose 3.2% to RM150.2 billion last year from RM145.5 billion in 2014. Malaysia accounted for 55.1% of Khazanah\\u2019s RAV by geographic exposure; while sector-wise, media and communications stood at 22%, followed by healthcare (17.2%), power (15.3%), financial institution groups (13.7%) and property (10.6%). \\u201cOur [2015 NWA] performance might be slightly worse than the FBM KLCI [which dropped by 1% last year], but we fared better than most of the reference regional markets,\\u201d Azman told reporters at the 12th Khazanah Annual Review yesterday. In its presentation, Khazanah compared its investment portfolio against the FBM KLCI, the Straits Times Index (-11.4%), the Jakarta Composite Index (-10.5%), the Hang Seng Index (-4%), Sensex (-3.7%), the Philippines Index (-2%), the Istanbul Index (-14.1%), the MSCI Emerging Markets (-14.9%), the MSCI Asia ex-Japan (-9.2%) and the MSCI AC World (-0.3%). The sole index seeing growth in Khazanah\\u2019s reference regional index was the Shanghai Index, which rose by 11.2% in 2015. \\u201cThe weak ringgit did have some effect on our foreign liabilities. Yes, we have US dollar-denominated assets like our shares in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, which would have strengthened the asset value. On a net-net basis, the weak ringgit did have some effect on our investments, although not by much,\\u201d Azman said. Towards this end, he said Khazanah has capped its foreign liabilities to 30% of its investment portfolio, \\u201cwhen at one point, it was more than 50%\\u201d. Looking at its major investments, only the healthcare sector, particularly IHH Healthcare Bhd, made a positive contribution to its NWA with a RM6.5 billion increase in 2015. Other sectors saw declines. Khazanah\\u2019s investments in CIMB Group Holdings Bhd saw the biggest decline of RM2.3 billion, and its stake in the telecommunications sector, specifically Telekom Malaysia Bhd and Axiata Group Bhd, declined RM900 million in net worth. Its foreign holdings in Alibaba, meanwhile, also declined by RM100 million. Khazanah\\u2019s RAV cover \\u2014 the ratio of its RAV to liabilities \\u2014 came to 3.1 times in 2015, down from the previous year\\u2019s 3.7 times. Khazanah\\u2019s profit before tax also fell by 63.4% for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2015 (FY15) to RM1.18 billion, from RM3.22 billion in FY14. This is the first time since the global financial crisis that Khazanah\\u2019s annual profit fell, excluding FY12 because of PLUS Expressways Bhd\\u2019s privatisation that occurred in FY11. Despite weaker profitability, Khazanah increased its dividend payout to the government by 16.7% to RM1.05 billion in FY15, from RM900 million the previous year. \\u201cWe might not be a listed company, but we want to have a dividend payout that is in line with major listed companies, where ideally you increase the payout gradually. And when there are years that you get a windfall, you declare special dividends,\\u201d said Azman. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not good to have a yo-yo pattern of dividends. The payout should have a steady progression.\\u201d Azman said while Khazanah expects this year will be another bumpy one, the higher dividend payout and lack of profit growth last year would not affect its funds, should it decide to make new investments this year. \\u201cBy other metrics, like our asset cover ratio, cash flow, liquidity, we have enough to take advantage of the market this year when there are opportunities,\\u201d he said. But this doesn\\u2019t mean that Khazanah wouldn\\u2019t be careful with its investments this year, Azman said. \\u201cIn times of turbulence, we need to look at the quality of our balance sheet and our RAV cover, a critical ratio that we have always looked at, [which] indicates that we are coming from a position of relative strength.  \\u201cThe issue is more on the fact that in volatile and uncertain times, there is the risk of being too early or too late [in making investments], and trying to time the entry is not easy,\\u201d he added. Looking at the first week of trading in 2016, where the world markets fell when Chinese stock markets were shut down twice after plummeting by 7%, he expects to see volatility continuing this year. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t get funds coming in every month. It\\u2019s not like a pension fund where there are new deposits coming in. We have to be careful with our investments,\\u201d Azman said. In 2015, Khazanah made 23 investments totalling RM8.7 billion and 10 divestments worth RM5.3 billion, with gains of RM2.9 billion. To date, the fund has made a total of 144 investments worth RM74.7 billion, as well as 77 divestments with overall gains of RM22.3 billion. Meanwhile, Azman said Khazanah had injected RM1 billion into ValueCap Sdn Bhd, following Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak\\u2019s directive last year to the equity investment firm to help prop up the stock market. Khazanah is one of the three shareholders of ValueCap, besides Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) and Permodalan Nasional Bhd."}, "275": {"date_posted": "12/1/2016", "title": "KLCI bucks regional fall; ringgit weakens", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 12): The FBM KLCI rose 3.78 points or 0.2% as investors bargain hunted for beaten-down stocks following the index's 20.02-point decline yesterday.

At closing bell, the FBM KLCI index gained 14.63 points or 0.88% to 1,685.36 points. Jupiter Securities chief market strategist Benny Lee said while investor sentiment remains in the bearish territory, stock declines over the past few weeks have brought some buying opportunities for those participating in the end-of-year trading season. \"Unless the composite index hits 1,740 points, then it might not seem that the sentiment is that bullish because the index faces resistance at this level,\" he told theedgemarkets.com over the phone today. Bloomberg data showed that the KLCI last breached the 1,740-point level on Aug 3, when it closed at 1,744.19 points. The index fell to the year's lowest closing of 1,532.14 points in a matter of three weeks. On the broader market, there were 1.88 billion shares collectively valued at RM1.71 billion traded, lower than the volume of 2 billion usually recorded. Lee said this indicates that many investors are still away on holiday. Gainers edged decliners at 452 and 397, respectively. Lee said many export-oriented stocks and oil and gas counters closed higher today. Today's most actively traded counter was Hubline Bhd, followed by Borneo Oil Bhd, and Hubline's warrant HUBLINE-WB. The biggest gainers were British American Tobacco (Malaysia) Bhd, Petronas Gas Bhd, and Time dotCom Bhd. Conversely, the worst decliners comprised Allianz Malaysia Bhd, Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd and PMB Technology Bhd.

South Korea's Kospi closed up 0.11% and Singapore's Straits Times Index rose 0.45%. Reuters reported Asian stocks poked into positive territory today, shrugging off early losses as Chinese shares rose a day after marking their biggest loss in a month and crude prices took back some lost ground.

The benchmark index was led by gains in AMMB Holdings Bhd, Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, and DiGi.Com Bhd. While the end of year is always seen as a time for fund managers to \"window-dress\" their stock portfolios by buying blue-chip equities, some fund managers said these stocks have been laggards this year and thus see upside potential in them. While today's gain might seem marginal, on a week-to-week basis the KLCI has gained 2.56% from last Monday's close of 1,629.09 points. Areca Capital Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Danny Wong Teck Meng told theedgemarkets.com that the higher closing prices for the past few days was the result of funds strategising their investment positions for at least the next six months. He said despite the low crude oil price environment that could continue for the next six months, there are opportunities in many blue chips after being laggards for the past year \\u2014 particularly in the banking and plantation sectors. \"It's normal for banks to be trading below their book values during times of (economic) crises. But we are not facing a crisis right now, yet some banking stocks are below their book values now. So, the valuations seem attractive,\" Wong said over the telephone today. And with state-owned investment fund ValueCap Sdn Bhd's imminent entry to the market, Wong is of the view that now is a good time to look at blue chips that have been underperforming so far.

JF Apex Securities Bhd head of research Lee Chung Cheng believes the rebound may be due to some \"window dressing\", and does not expect the positive momentum to be able to sustain the profit-taking that he expects may arise next week. According to Reuters, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan firmed to the highest after the US market recorded a second session of gain on Tuesday, and oil prices rebounded as traders squared positions ahead of a traditional year-end period of low liquidity. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up almost 1%, while the S&P 500 index ended 0.88% higher on Tuesday. Most Asian markets registered gains, up between 0.5% and 1% today.

KUALA LUMPUR: Axiata Group Bhd, 38.2% owned by Khazanah Nasional Bhd, is buying a controlling stake in Nepal\\u2019s largest mobile operator Ncell Pte Ltd for US$1.37 billion (RM5.91 billion) in cash, which will give Axiata an immediate foothold in the market there. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia yesterday, Axiata said its wholly-owned subsidiary Axiata Investments (UK) Ltd had signed a sale and purchase agreement (SPA) and other ancillary agreements with TeliaSonera UTA Holdings BV and SEA Telecom Investments BV for the acquisition of the entire issued capital of Reynolds Holdings Ltd, which in turn holds an 80% stake in Ncell. The remaining 20% stake in Ncell is currently held by Niraj Govinda Shrestha. However, this will be transferred to Sunivera Capital Venture Pvt Ltd prior to the completion of the proposed acquisition. Axiata said it had also signed a shareholders\\u2019 agreement with Sunivera and Bhavana Singh Shrestha to regulate the operation and management of Ncell upon completion of the proposed acquisition. Axiata said it will fund the proposed acquisition via a combination of internal funds, debt instruments and external borrowings. Ncell currently holds a 57.5% share of Nepal\\u2019s market in revenue terms. Ncell has 13 million mobile subscribers as of July 17, giving it a market share of 48.8%. Axiata said NCell also holds sufficient and a good mix of spectrum portfolio, including paired spectrum of 8MHz of 900MHz, 11MHz of 1800MHz and 10MHZ of 2100MHz spectrum. Ncell\\u2019s revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate of 19.9% between financial year ended July 15, 2013 (FY13) and FY15, with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margin of 62.2% in FY15. Kenanga Research telecom analyst Cheow Ming Liang remains neutral on the news as it has yet to incorporate the impact of the Ncell acquisition into its earnings forecasts. He noted that Axiata\\u2019s debt position remains manageable at 1.92 times its Ebitda as of end-September. \\u201cHowever, with the group\\u2019s recent acquisition [of a 75% stake in Digicel Asian Holdings Pte Ltd (DAH) at an enterprise value of US$221 million], Axiata may be moving to its optimal debt ratio of between two times and 2.2 times,\\u201d he told The Edge Financial Daily. Analysts expect Axiata to undertake a cash call to fund its acquisition of Ncell. \\u201cWith cash and cash equivalents of RM4.06 billion as of Sept 30, 2015, and the purchase price [of Ncell] at close to RM6 billion, coupled with the acquisition of DAH of about RM500 million, Axiata\\u2019s free cash flow per year is about RM1.5 billion. So, it looks a bit tight,\\u201d an analyst told The Edge Financial Daily. The analyst also said the proposed acquisition of Ncell may increase Axiata\\u2019s capital expenditure (capex), noting that the Nepal earthquake in April had caused damaged to its physical infrastructure vital to telecom players. According to a report by CIMB Research on Nov 27, Axiata\\u2019s registered RM555 million in capex for the first nine months of FY15 and is expected to rack up to RM950 million for full-year FY15, lower than the RM1 billion to RM1.1 billion as previously projected by Axiata. The proposed acquisition of Ncell is subject to approval from Axiata shareholders and Bank Negara Malaysia, and transfer of the remaining 20% stake to Sunivera. The transaction is expected to close by the first half of 2016. The SPA will be automatically terminated if all parties fail to fulfil all conditions by June 30, 2016, unless otherwise agreed by all parties. Axiata said Ncell\\u2019s strong cash flow generation with an operating free cash flow of over 22 billion rupees (RM890.59 million) per year, would further support Axiata\\u2019s dividend paying policy. The group also said the implied last 12 months\\u2019 enterprise valuation over Ebitda of five times, including controlling premium in Ncell is an attractive valuation compared with 5.7 times and 8.4 times for South Asia and Asean peers respectively. \\u201c[It is] consistent with Axiata\\u2019s merger and acquisition priorities of an opportunistic footprint expansion, being both very attractive strategically and financially for the group,\\u201d said Axiata president and group chief executive officer Datuk Seri Jamaludin Ibrahim.

Berjaya Land Bhd's (BLand) net profit for the second quarter ended Oct 31, 2015 (2QFY16) jumped 23 times to RM208.3 million or 4.17 sen per share from RM8.97 million or 0.18 sen per share a year ago, mainly due to gain on disposal arising from the dilution of its stake in Berjaya Kyoto Development (S) Pte Ltd. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, BLand said the better earnings was also due to higher contribution from H.R Owen Plc and its property development and investment businesses. This was, however, offset by lower profit reported by Sports Toto Malaysia Sdn Bhd (STMSB) and its hotels and resorts business arising from lower revenue due to lower average room rates. Revenue for 2QFY16 rose 14.9% to RM1.62 billion from RM1.41 billion in 2QFY15. For the cumulative six-month period (6MFY16), BLand's net profit increased 4.7 times to RM218.211 million or 4.37 sen per share from RM46.64 million or 0.94 sen per share in 6MFY15 for the same reasons. Revenue for 6MFY16 was 11.1% higher at RM3.13 billion from RM2.82 billion in 6MFY15. Moving forward, BLand is of the view that the operating performance of the group will continue to remain challenging in the remaining quarters of the financial year ending April 30, 2016. Utusan Melayu (Malaysia) Bhd (Utusan) has disposed of its entire 20% stake in Maqamad Sdn Bhd to MHA59 Sdn Bhd for RM48 million to improve its operating cash flow and strengthen its financial position. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, the loss-making publishing company said its unit Utusan Land Sdn Bhd had entered into a share sale agreement with MHA59 for the proposed disposal last Thursday (Dec 17). The deal involves the disposal of Utusan Land's entire 20% equity interest or 100,000 shares in Maqamad to MHA59. Utusan said the original cost of investment in Maqamad was RM100,000 incurred in April 2015. Maqamad is principally involved in property development and general trading, and is actively seeking to increase its land bank for future business expansion, said Utusan. MHA59 is a Subang-based private company, principally involved in the leasing of intellectual property and similar products (except copyrighted works), business management consultancy services and the development of building projects for its own operation. The sale proceeds will be utilised for Utusan group's day-to-day operation.\\u00a0Utusan said the disposal is expected to result in an improvement to its earnings by approximately RM48 million for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2015, and contribute positively to its earnings per share. The publishing company, which is 49.77%-owned by Umno and publishes the Utusan Malaysia and Kosmo! newspapers, has been loss making since 2012. Fidelity Management and Research (FMR LLC), the second-largest mutual fund and financial services group in the world, has emerged as a substantial shareholder in Ajinomoto (Malaysia) Bhd with a 5.04% stake. In a filing with Bursa today, Ajinomoto said FMR LLC emerged as the company's shareholder after acquiring 3.04 million or 5% stake on Dec 7. The monosodium glutamate (MSG) manufacturer said the financial services group then acquired an additional 15,400 shares or 0.04% stake in the company via three separate transactions between Dec 10 and Dec 11. None of the filings stated the price of the transactions. Following the purchases, FMR LLC is now in control of 3.06 million or 5.04% stake in the company. Ajinomoto was slapped with an unusual market activity query by Bursa Malaysia last Thursday (Dec 17) on the sudden rally in its share price. The counter saw its share price rise to an all-time high of RM9.30 last Wednesday (Dec 16) from RM7.31 on Dec 10.\\u00a0 Pestech International Bhd is tendering for contracts worth US$20 million in the Philippines, said the group's executive director Ir Paul Lim Pay Chuan.

Information and communications technology (ICT) security solutions provider Scan Associates Bhd, which is embroiled in a boardroom tussle with former chief executive director and co-founder Datuk Dr Norbik Bashah Idris, hopes to break even this financial year ending June 30, 2016 (FY16) backed by cost cutting efforts. Its executive director Mak Siew Wei, who is a substantial shareholder in the company with a 6.19% stake, said Scan Associates is looking to reduce its operating costs. A July 24 filing with Bursa Malaysia showed that Norbik, together with former director Hussin Othman, has requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting to be convened to vote on the removal of four company directors including Mak. Norbik holds a 5.89% stake in Scan Associates as at Sept 22, 2015. Scan Associates is currently being managed by its executive committee after the resignation of Norbik in June this year. Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB)'s executive director Mohd Imran Mohamad Salim said that it is a continuous effort for the group to simultaneously grow its business yet pare down debts that stood at 1.13 times its equity. After MRCB's extraordinary general meeting (EGM) today, Mohd Imran told reporters that the group has been in talks with Indonesian and Thai companies to enter the property and construction businesses there. He said MRCB was looking at executing a deal with parties in Indonesia and Thailand sometime in 2017. Meanwhile, MRCB, which is saddled with debts of RM3.06 billion, is open to selling the Eastern Dispersal Link (EDL) highway in Johor, said chief financial officer Ann Wan Tee.\nMohd Imran added that, however, the focus now is on restructuring EDL's debts. The highway, which was completed in 2012, had RM1.21 billion of outstanding debts. In total, MRCB's net borrowings stood at 1.13 times of its RM2.27 billion in shareholders' fund as at the end of the third quarter of its financial year ending Dec 31, 2015 (3QFY15). MCT Bhd has dismissed the concerns of a possible mandatory takeover by its single largest shareholder Ayala Land Inc after the latter raised its stake in the company to 32.95% on Oct 16 from 9.16% previously for US$92 million. Ayala Land's shareholding is just 0.05% below the 33% threshold of a mandatory general offer (MGO). Today, MCT executive director Datuk Lim Kok Boon discounted the possibility and does not think Ayala Land will trigger a MGO.

The purchase consideration shall be satisfied in cash and shall\\u00a0be funded via a combination of internally generated funds, debt instruments and external\\u00a0borrowings.

Axiata said the purchase meets all of Axiata\\u2019s merger and acquisition (M&A) criteria of brownfield investment, management control, growth market, attractive valuation, being earnings accretive and is within its target footprint. Axiata said Ncell\\u2019s strong cashflow generation with an operating free cashflow of over NPR22 billion (US$217 million or RM923 million) per annum, would further support Axiata\\u2019s dividend paying policy. \\u201cNcell has delivered revenue CAGR of 19.9% between financial year 2013 to 2015 (FY13 to FY15), with attractive earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin of 62.2% in FY15,\\u201d it added.

Axiata also said the implied last-twelve-months enterprise valuation over EBITDA of 5 times including controlling premium in Ncell is an attractive valuation compared to 5.7 times and 8.4 times for South Asia and Asean peers, respectively. \\u201c[It is] consistent with Axiata\\u2019s merger and acquisition (M&A) priorities of an opportunistic footprint expansion, being both very attractive strategically and financially for the group,\\u201d the statement read. Axiata president and Group chief executive officer (CEO) Datuk Seri Jamaludin Ibrahim said the acquisition was a \\u201crare opportunistic asset\\u201d for the Axiata Group. \\u201cConsolidating Ncell to Axiata\\u2019s FY14 pro forma, the new asset would be immediately accretive to the group, contributing approximately 9% to revenue and 19% to PATAMI, and would make it one of the highest contributors to earnings for the group.\\u00a0 \\u201cThis also increases the resilience of Axiata with a more diversified portfolio given that Ncell would be a very sizeable part of the group and lessen our traditional high dependency on the two largest operating companies.\\u201d Jamaludin also said the company\\u2019s entry into Nepal is a long-term strategic move for the group.

KUALA LUMPUR: Khazanah Nasional Bhd managing director (MD) Tan Sri Azman Mokhtar has had his contract extended for three more years, from June 1, 2016 to May 31, 2019. In a statement yesterday, Khazanah, chaired by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, said its board of directors had approved to extend the employment contract of Azman at a meeting on Saturday. Azman, 54, has been with the investment holding arm of the Malaysian government since June 1, 2004. During his leadership tenure, the company reported a 10-year cumulative pre-tax profit of RM22.33 billion at the end of 2014. The net asset value of Khazanah\\u2019s investment also increased 9.2% to RM110.8 billion at the end of 2014 from RM101.5 billion a year earlier, bolstered by a RM3.9 billion gain from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\\u2019s share sale. Under Azman\\u2019s tenure, Khazanah divested its 32.2% stake in national postal company, Pos Malaysia Bhd, to DRB-Hicom Bhd, owned by tycoon Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar al-Bukhary, for RM622.79 million or RM3.60 per share in 2011. Khazanah also sold its 42.7% stake in national carmaker Proton Holdings Bhd to conglomerate DRB-Hicom for RM1.29 billion or RM5.50 per Proton share the following year, as part of the government\\u2019s strategy to boost liquidity in the local stock market and monetise assets. It was also during Azman\\u2019s tenure that Khazanah in August 2011 sought to undertake a controversial share-swap deal between Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS), in which Khazanah was its largest shareholder with a 69.37% stake, and low-cost carrier AirAsia Bhd. However, this was later scrapped amid political pressure and protests from the workers\\u2019 union at MAS. Last year, Khazanah bought the rest of MAS in a bid to save the ailing national carrier. In December 2014, it delisted MAS and revealed another turnaround plan involving RM6 billion in funding, 6,000 job cuts and less routes. It also transferred all operations, including assets and liabilities, to a new company called Malaysia Airlines Bhd (MAB), with an aim that the airline regains profitability by the end of 2017 and relists by 2020. Azman is also the chairman of Iskandar Investment Bhd and Axiata Group Bhd and holds various board memberships including Yayasan Khazanah and Jadwa Investment of Saudi Arabia. He serves on various public service bodies including the Performance Management and Delivery Unit, executive committee of Malaysia International Islamic Financial Centre and Governance Council of Agensi Inovasi Malaysia. Formerly, he was the MD and co-founder of BinaFikir Sdn Bhd, and director and head of country research at Salomon Smith Barney Malaysia and Union Bank of Switzerland in Malaysia. Azman also previously served in various capacities with Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB).

In Britain, the UK\\u2019s largest broadband provider, BT Group, has mounted a \\u00a312.5 billion takeover of mobile operator EE \\u2014 some 14 years after BT spun off its mobile arm O2. Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa\\u2019s mobile operator, Three, which proposed to buy O2 from Telefonica for \\u00a310.25 billion, reportedly argued to the European competition watchdog that the Three-O2 merger should be allowed for them to better compete with BT and Vodafone. Other proposed mergers in recent years include Wind and 3 Italia in Italy. To be sure, not all mergers worked out. Norwegian Telenor ASA and Swedish TeliaSonera failed to merge their respective Danish mobile operations and in the US, AT&T withdrew a proposed merger bid for T-Mobile USA in 2011, following antitrust-related objections. While regulatory issues are a concern, it is not likely to stop all marriage plans. In fact, the UK\\u2019s Competition and Market Authority said a BT-EE merger is not expected to substantially reduce competition. For Axiata Group Bhd, president and group CEO Datuk Seri Jamaludin Ibrahim says the group continues to be for consolidation wherever it makes sense to acquire or form partnerships. \\u201cIn every country, we\\u2019re thinking proactively and reactively who to buy and who not to buy. We were thinking of Bangladesh for the last two years before we found someone to merge with. It\\u2019s the same for Indonesia and Sri Lanka,\\u201d Jamaludin says, adding that any M&A would be \\u201copportunistic \\u2026 unless it is too good to forgo\\u201d. He qualified, though, that Axiata is \\u201cnot going around with a big cheque book\\u201d for shopping, but will consider any deal that either supports its core business or expands and enhances its core competences. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think we are going to be very aggressive \\u2026 the focus is primarily consolidation. We\\u2019ve done four already. Two very small ones in Sri Lanka, one medium-sized in Cambodia, a large one in Indonesia [Axis] and we\\u2019ve just announced a MoU in Bangladesh,\\u201d he says. Robi Axiata, Bangladesh\\u2019s second largest operator by revenue, entered into a joint venture with Trust Bank to provide mobile financial services, just weeks after announcing a partnership with digital security provider Gemalto NV. Yet for investors looking at Malaysia, the biggest question of all is possibly whether Khazanah Nasional Bhd will decide to again merge its regional mobile champion Axiata Group Bhd with Telekom Malaysia Bhd. With its acquisition of Green Packet Bhd\\u2019s Packet One Sdn Bhd (P1), Telekom is seen as a formidable challenger to Malaysia\\u2019s big three mobile phone operators: DiGi.Com Bhd, Maxis Bhd and Celcom Axiata Bhd. The mobile operators, in turn, lease fibre capacity from Telekom, which spent over RM10 billion on building a high-speed broadband (HSBB) network and received co-investments from the government to expand that network to areas that might not immediately be commercially profitable. Khazanah\\u2019s decision in late 2007 to spin off Telekom\\u2019s mobile operations into today\\u2019s Axiata, created an investor favourite in Telekom as it offered steady dividends at a time of record low interest rates as it invested to build the HSBB network. Unless it announces a policy change, Telekom continues to be the only stock on Bursa Malaysia with a minimum dividend promise \\u2014 a minimum of RM700 million a year or up to 90% of its profit.

While its existing ATT service allows only prepaid credit transfer among users of one telecommunications service provider, Sedania in a statement in conjunction with the launch today said ShareShare OTT allows prepaid mobile subscribers from various networks to top up, transfer and request airtime credit via its proprietary ShareShare credit 'Heartz' to users of other network providers. Participating telecommunications providers included Celcom Axiata Bhd, DiGi.Com Bhd, Maxis Bhd, Tune Talk Sdn Bhd and U Mobile Sdn Bhd. ShareShare OTT also enables users to transfer and request airtime from users of the same network or others, via the over-the-top method, according to Sedania. Speaking to reporters after ShareShare OTT's launch, Sedania's executive director Firoz Mohd Noor said the mobile application's launch was timely to adapt to the growing consumption of mobile data. \"SMS (short messaging system) is still relevant (among mobile telephone users) \\u2014 even in Malaysia. But data usage has become more relevant today than it was this time last year,\" he said. The introduction of the new service is timely for Sedania to combat the slowdown in consumption in Malaysia. Firoz conceded that since the goods and services tax (GST) was introduced in April, there was a drop in customer transactions. Nowadays, Firoz said the average daily transactions came to 266,000. This compared with the approximate 324,000 transactions it used to garner before the GST regime. \"But we expect that consumption will rebound next year, when people are getting used to prices after the GST,\" he added. Consequently, turnover for the nine-month ended Sept 30, 2015 (9MFY15) for Sedania's Malaysian operations dropped by 12% to RM5.1 million. Its Bangladeshi segment's top line, however, grew by 10.52% year-on-year to RM1.86 million.

In an interview with The Edge Financial Daily, group managing director Sam Ooi Chin Khoon revealed that the two major contracts are both construction jobs. BTS, or more commonly known as telco towers, are used to transmit signals between operators\\u2019 call centres and mobile devices. \\u201cIn Malaysia there is plenty of work at the moment. We probably might announce one or two very big contracts that we will sign very soon. I think next year (FY16) we can enjoy similar growth like this year from our current businesses,\\u201d he said. Last week, OCK announced that net profit for 3QFY15 jumped 62.24% to RM4.89 million from RM3.01 million a year ago, while revenue leaped 74.62% to RM83.7 million from RM47.93 million a year ago. In the nine-month cumulative period (9MFY15), OCK\\u2019s net profit rose 44.55% to RM13.09 million from RM9.05 million last year, while revenue increased by 64.21% to RM210.13 million from RM127.97 million. Along with the quarterly report, OCK also disclosed that a memorandum of understanding (MoU) had been entered into between the group and its Myanmar partner, King Royal Technologies Co Ltd, with Telenor Myanmar Ltd. The MoU is for the building and leasing of tower infrastructure to Telenor. All parties aim to conclude the agreement in the next few weeks. The contract being negotiated is for 12 years, and involves building 920 three-legged towers on a build-and-lease basis, with an expected completion date in 2016, with Telenor having two-month exclusivity to lease the facilities. This means that after the two-month tenure, OCK could lease the infrastructure to more tenants. A typical three-legged tower would usually cost about US$80,000 (RM341,000) to construct. Ooi said OCK would normally aim to achieve an internal rate of return (IRR) of 15% in build-and-lease projects. \\u201cAn IRR of 15% is meant for one tenant, if we manage to secure more tenants to lease the tower, then it (IRR) will be more than that,\\u201d he explained. Suppose the group manages to seal a deal with Telenor, Ooi said OCK is confident of clinching more contracts in Myanmar. \\u201cThere is no agreement for the construction of a second batch of towers, but if we make a success out of the first project, I think we stand a good chance to win the second one from Telenor,\\u201d he said. Other than Myanmar, the group also has presence in Cambodia and Indonesia. For 9MFY15, 15.73% of OCK\\u2019s revenue came from outside Malaysia in the Asean region. This compared with 5.33% in the previous corresponding period. Ooi said that OCK\\u2019s project in Cambodia involves dredging and laying works for 800km of fibre for Telecom Cambodia, the country\\u2019s state-owned telco company. In Indonesia, he said OCK is only involved in maintaining BTS for the country\\u2019s telco tower companies. \\u201cCurrently, we are maintaining about 20,000 BTS in Indonesia. We prefer not to own BTS there as there are a lot of bigger telco tower companies in Indonesia, it is difficult for us to compete,\\u201d he said. Locally, Ooi said competition among telco operators bodes well for OCK as the former will invest more in BTS construction. \\u201cI think the construction business [of BTS] will still be strong for the next two years, due to the LTE (Long Term Evolution) deployment,\\u201d he said. Ooi reckoned that telco operators that have deployed LTE like Maxis Bhd, DiGi.Com Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, U Mobile Sdn Bhd, and Packet One Networks (M) Sdn Bhd, will need another two years to complete the coverage in Malaysia. \\u201cTelco tower is a very unique industry, when one operator spend, the rest will follow. For FY16, we already have 250 BTS in the pipeline, all under the build-and-lease model, and we will try to secure more,\\u201d he said. Ooi also mentioned that OCK\\u2019s margins for the construction of BTS are quite attractive, especially those awarded by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC). \\u201cWe provide a combination of maintenance, roll-out, equipment servicing, optimisation, drive-test, margin from some of these specifications are quite good, but if doing just the civil works, then the margin might be low,\\u201d he explained. Ooi revealed that the gross margin for MCMC projects could go up to 30%. \\u00a0 Apart from BTS construction, due to the LTE deployment, Ooi said local operators are working to replace microwaves in signal transmission technology with fibre optic cable. \\u201cLTE involves bigger data traffic, so fibre cable can increase the speed and capacity of transmission compared with microwave. In Malaysia, we have nearly 25,000 BTS, operators are fiberising their signal transmission technology,\\u201d he said. \\u201cTherefore, I think more fibre trenching works will be deployed moving forward, and OCK now is one of the biggest fibre contractor for operators in Malaysia,\\u201d Ooi added. One of the fibre trenching works OCK secured in 1HFY15 was from Maxis, with an estimated value of RM25 million. OCK (fundamental: 1.6; valuation: 0.8) closed 1.5 sen or 2.17% higher at 70.5 sen last Friday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM546.7 million.

AMMB Holdings Bhd\\u00a0(AmBank Group) said the RM53.7 million penalty imposed on it by Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) was a result of weaknesses in its reporting systems and processes. It told Bursa Malaysia that the BNM's action for the non-compliance came about because of weaknesses in its reporting systems and processes in place at the time, as well as inadequate skills on the part of some of its staff.\\u00a0 \"The non-compliance did not result in financial losses either to AmBank Group, save for the penalty, or to its customers. BNM has not placed any restrictions on the business operations of AmBank Group,\" it added. The stock exchange had, in a letter dated Nov 24, required AmBank Group to provide more details about the fine, which the group had announced about a day earlier. AmBank Group had earlier stated only that the fine was a result of non-compliance with certain regulations. AmBank Group also said it had strengthened its organisational structure in the area of compliance in order to improve its systems and processes. \"To strengthen the compliance function, AmBank Group has recruited a number of senior and experienced officers. For all of its staff, AmBank Group has increased and enhanced training and awareness programmes and, at the same time, senior management and the respective boards have heightened the oversight and improved the check and balance processes,\" it said.\\u00a0 Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd\\u00a0has bagged a contract worth between RM93 million and RM100 million from Ophir Production Sdn Bhd to provide engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning (EPCIC) services for the Ophir wellhead platform, located offshore Peninsular Malaysia. The contract will commence this month for a period of 14 months to final hook-up and commissioning offshore, according to the filing to Bursa Malaysia.\\u00a0 The group also announced its quarterly earnings for the three month ended Sept 30. Its net profit for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3QFY15) rose 13.27% to RM22.96 million from RM20.7 million a year ago due to improved operational efficiencies of the Favelle Favco crane division, as well as further growth and foreign exchange gain from its Cambodian airports operation. Its revenue for the period came in 4.6% higher at RM393.62 million from RM376.1 million in 3QFY14. For the nine-month period (9MFY15), net profit increased 6.8% to RM65.51 million or 14.43 sen per share from RM61.36 million or 14.52 sen per share a year ago, while revenue decreased 5.6% to RM1.17 billion from RM1.24 billion in 9MFY14. Muhibbah Engineering has a total outstanding secured order book in hand of RM2.15 billion as at Nov 20, 2015, its filing shows. Axiata Group Bhd\\u00a0announced a 40% jump on its net profit to RM891.39 million in the third quarter ended Sept 30, from RM635.85 million a year ago. Revenue grew to RM5.07 billion from RM4.65 billion in the previous corresponding quarter. Axiata explained that the stronger US dollar had led to higher revenue in ringgit terms when the company converted its overseas income into the local currency. The telco said it registered higher revenue from its operating units in Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Cambodia. Malaysian operations, however, recorded lower income. Its net profit for the cumulative nine-month period (9MFY15) rose to RM2.09 billion from RM1.77 billion a year earlier. Revenue was higher at RM14.52 billion versus RM13.9 billion in 9MFY14. Alliance Financial Group Bhd\\u00a0reported a 25.3% drop in net profit for its second financial quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (2QFY16) to RM134.66 million or 8.8 sen per share, from RM180.33 million or 11.9 sen per share a year ago. Net interest income fell 3.6% to RM213.12 million in 2QFY16 from RM221.139 million in 2QFY15. For the first six months ended Sept 30, 2015 (1HFY16), the group reported a 17.5% drop in net profit to RM256.59 million or 16.8 sen per share from RM311.14 million or 20.5 sen per share due to higher allowance for losses on loans in 1HFY16 and a gain from disposal of land, which was recorded in 1HFY15, the banking group announced to Bursa Malaysia. Nevertheless, Alliance declared an interim dividend of eight sen per share, representing a dividend payout ratio of 48.3%, which will be paid on Dec 30. Net interest income for 1HFY16 came in at RM420.9 million compared to RM420.96 million a year ago. The group recorded a return on equity of 11.5% for 1HFY16. The gross impaired loans ratio remained stable at 1.1% as at Sept 30, 2015 (industry 1.6%) with loan loss coverage of 92.7%. Net loans and advances stood at RM37.6 billion, growing 10.2% year-on-year (y-o-y) and 5.8% on an annualised basis. The group's loan origination efforts were focused on the better risk adjusted return loans, namely in small to medium enterprise, commercial and consumer unsecured lending. Affin Holdings Bhd\\u00a0posted a lower net profit of RM102.39 million or 5.27 sen per share for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3QFY15) compared with RM133.95 million or 6.95 sen per share a year ago, as a result of higher allowance for loan impairment and lower operating income. Net income for 3QFY15 fell 7.8% to RM459.79 million from RM498.71 million in 3QFY14. Nevertheless, the group declared an interim dividend of 2.99 sen for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2015 (FY15), payable on Dec 30. For the cumulative nine-month period (9MFY15), net profit slid to RM271.86 million or 13.99 sen per share from RM384.07 million or 23.41 sen per share, due to higher allowance for loan impairment and higher overhead expenses of RM132.4 million and RM56.1 million respectively. The 29.2% drop in net profit was offset by the write-back of allowance for securities impairment of RM23.6 million and a reduction in finance cost of RM20.1 million. Net income slipped by a marginal 0.08% to RM1.338 billion in 9MFY15 from RM1.339 billion in 9MFY14. In a statement on Friday, Affin said it reported an annualised loan growth rate of 4.3% for 9MFY15, predominantly in the segments of revolving credit, hire purchase, and housing loans/financing. As at Sept 30, 2015, the group's loan to deposit ratio from customers was maintained at 91.4%, while the ratio of consumer deposits to total deposits stood at 29.7%. The group's gross impaired loan ratio also stood at 2.21%, an increase of 17 basis points compared with June 30, 2015. In a separate announcement, Affin has announced its subsidiary Affin Hwang Investment Bank Bhd and Thai-based Thanachart Securities PCL have today entered a strategic business alliance for collaboration in the area of institutional equities trading and research. Under the agreement, Affin Hwang IB will have the exclusive right to distribute Thanachart Securities PCL's research reports covering companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) to Malaysian institutional investors, on a co-branded basis. Thanachart Securities is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Thanachart Bank. In return, Affin Hwang IB will channel its institutional clients' trade orders for shares quoted on the SET via Thanachart Securities. E&O,\\u00a0which saw its second-quarter net profit jump 15% year-on-year on higher revenue, reveals that the group\\u2019s Seri Tanjung Pinang Phase 2 (STP2) project is on track with the commencement of reclamation works expected to take place before the year end. In a statement on Friday, E&O deputy managing director Eric Chan Kok Leong said the syndicated term loan for the project will be signed soon. Last month, Chinese contractor China Communications Construction Company (M) Sdn Bhd was awarded the RM2.32 billion worth of land reclamation works for STP2. On the compliance and regulatory front, Chan said all relevant requirements and authorities' approvals for STP2 are in hand. These include the approval of the project's Detailed Environmental Impact Assessment study by the Federal Department of Environment, endorsement of the STP2 master plan and granting of the planning permission for STP2 reclamation works by the Penang state authorities. Chan also noted that the proposed listing of E&O's subsidiary Eastern & Oriental PLC on AIM of the London Stock Exchange is awaiting approval from the UK Listing Authority and is expected to be listed in the first half of next year. On its latest quarterly result, E&O saw its net profit for the three months ended Sept 30, 2015 (2QFY16) grew to RM24.45 million or 1.99 sen per share from RM21.24 million or 1.74 sen per share a year ago. Revenue grew 10.9% to RM85.71 million in 2QFY16 from RM77.29 million in 2QFY15. For the cumulative six-month period (6MFY16), E&O's net profit rose 18.7% to RM47.71 million or 3.89 sen per share from RM40.2 million or 3.29 sen per share in 6MFY15. Accumulative revenue for 6MFY16, however, fell by 25.3% to RM154.6 million from RM207.04 million in 6MFY15, mainly due to lower revenue from the property segment, which registered a decrease of RM53.778 million. Moving forward, E&O said its focus will be on ensuring that it is well-poised for future opportunities, while ensuring that it maintains prudent cashflow management with sound financial planning to address current needs."}, "295": {"date_posted": "27/11/2015", "title": "Axiata's 3Q profit jumps 40% on higher revenue from foreign ops", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 27): Axiata Group Bhd reported a 40% rise in third quarter net profit from a year earlier as the mobile telecommunication network provider earned higher revenue from operations abroad.

In a statement today, the credit rating agency said that it had reiterated its conclusion in its analysis of three Malaysian corporate sukuk which it rated in 2015, namely Axiata Group Bhd (Baa2 stable), Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) (A3 positive), and Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) (A1 stable). Moody's assistant vice president Nidhi Dhruv said that from a credit-risk perspective, these sukuk structures do not have any material asset-backed or equity features. \"As such, investors ultimately rely on the creditworthiness of the corporates backing the sukuk to ensure that all payment obligations are fulfilled,\" he said. He added that Moody's rates US$5 billion (RM21.56 billion) of sukuk instruments from Malaysia-based non-financial corporates as of November 2015, and all sukuk ratings are on par with the companies' respective senior unsecured ratings, reflecting the companies' underlying credit quality. Moody's analysis is contained in its just-released report Axiata, Petronas, TM: Sukuk Ratings Reflect Underlying Corporates' Credit Quality, co-authored by Dhruv as well as associate analysts Maisam Hasnain and Vincent Tordo. Both Hasnain and Tordo are Islamic finance specialists in Moody's corporate finance group. The report provides an overview of the factors it considers when analysing the credit quality of sukuk. \"The three sukuk we rated this year have similar structures whereby the underlying corporate sets up and manages a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to hold the assets and issue the sukuk. \"The SPV (on behalf of investors) also assigns the corporate as its agent. In this capacity, the agent is effectively responsible for using the sukuk proceeds to purchase the sukuk assets, manage the sukuk portfolio and pay associated cash flows,\" said Hasnain. Moody's further noted that additional structural features, which include the underlying corporates' flexibility in selecting sukuk assets, do not affect the credit quality of the sukuk. \"In line with its senior unsecured rating, Petronas' sukuk rating is higher than that of TM and Axiata, reflecting the company's fundamental credit quality, which is the strongest of the three owing to its low leverage and strong interest coverage,\" said Moody's. In its analysis, Moody's does not provide an opinion on the sukuk transactions' compliance with syariah. \"Compliance is a subjective matter for the parties involved, who rely on the endorsement of a recognised board of syariah experts,\" said Moody's.

However, these markets started to pull back in the past two days and erased most gains. China\\u2019s Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite rose 0.3% in a week to 3,434.27 points. Japan Nikkei 225 index increased 3.1% in a week to 18,777.04 points. Hong Kong\\u2019s Hang Seng Index increased 0.7% to 23,142.73 points and Singapore\\u2019s Straits Times rose 1.1% to 3,052.53 points. Markets in the US and Europe rallied last week. On Monday, the US Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 2.3% in a week to its two months high at 17,623.05 points on a stronger US dollar. Germany\\u2019s DAX Index jumped 6.1% to 10,794.54, also at its highest in two months, while London\\u2019s FTSE100 rose 1.1% in a week to 6,417.02 points. The US dollar strengthened and this weighed down gold and oil prices. The US Dollar Index futures increased marginally from 95 points a week ago to 97 points on Monday. COMEX gold price declined 1% in a week to US$1,162.90 (RM4,919.06) an ounce. WTI crude oil fell 6.1% in a week to US$43.73 per barrel on glut worries. Crude palm oil on Bursa Malaysia was firm at RM2,320 per tonne. Despite the correction in the past two weeks, the FBM KLCI remained in a bullish trend. Technically, the index is bullish above the short-term 30-day moving average and the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. The short-term 30-day moving average is now at 1,668 points. However, the bullish momentum remained weak as the market continued to face resistance. The RSI, MACD and Momentum Oscillator indicators continued to decline indicating weak momentum. The Stochastic indicator has pulled back below its overbought level and this indicates a reversal. Furthermore, the index is now near the middle band of the Bollinger Bands indicator. All these indicate that the market is still in a correction. The market remained directionless. The FBM KLCI is currently at the support level of the sideways correction in the past two weeks. However, a decline below the support level at 1,695 points could trigger further selling pressure and the index may fall to the next support level at 1,650 points. If it stays above this level, continue to expect the market to be directionless this week.  Benny Lee is chief market strategist for Jupiter Securities Sdn Bhd.

What\\u2019s more, Axiata\\u2019s entry into Myanmar \\u2014 by taking a 75% controlling stake in Digicel Myanmar Tower Co Ltd (MTC) in a deal that values the latter at US$221 million (RM911.6 million) \\u2014 also expands the company\\u2019s portfolio of tower assets, which investors have long seen as a potential for initial public offering. An IPO would free up cash for expansion and dividend payments, but this is not a priority at the moment for Axiata, which is looking to become one of the largest, most efficient and profitable tower companies in the world. It is currently in the top 20. In fact, Axiata told analysts last week that edotco Group Sdn Bhd \\u2014 its wholly-owned subsidiary that is buying the 75% stake in MTC \\u2014 is looking to buy at least one more tower company. Its tower unit is working at expanding its portfolio from over 14,700 towers in August to as many as 25,000 by year end. When describing the MTC deal, Axiata president and group CEO Datuk Seri Jamaludin Ibrahim said in a statement that the deal \\u201cis very much in line with Axiata\\u2019s long-term strategy to create new revenue streams apart from the core mobile business. The acquisition will enhance Axiata\\u2019s telecoms tower infrastructure business significantly in a market outside the group\\u2019s existing footprint\\u201d. The MTC deal may also gain the group a new strategic partner in Myanmar tycoon Serge Pun, whose Singapore-listed Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd (fundamental: 1.90; valuation: 1.10) owns the remaining 25% stake in MTC. Forbes lists Pun at No 45 on its \\u201cSingapore\\u2019s 50 Richest\\u201d list \\u2014 he has an estimated net worth of US$505 million this year. His son and former Goldman Sachs banker Melvyn Pun, who is also Yoma\\u2019s CEO, said in an Oct 2 statement to the Singapore Exchange that the company \\u201cis still in discussions with edotco regarding its 25% shareholding\\u201d, will evaluate its options and make further announcements when there is a material development. It remains to be seen if Yoma will stay on as a strategic partner or divest its 25% stake to Axiata. Yoma believes its stake is worth US$20 million more than the value carried in its books \\u2014 based on the enterprise value of US$221 million agreed between Digicel Group Ltd and Axiata\\u2019s edotco for the 75% stake. According to the presentation slides at Yoma\\u2019s annual general meeting on July 27, part of the US$50 million loan it had received from the Asian Development Bank (the first tranche of a US$100 million loan) has been earmarked for three projects, including the \\u201cconstruction and leasing of telecoms towers by Myanmar Tower Company\\u201d. It is not immediately known whether any of the funds have been used. While analysts do not expect funding to be an issue for Axiata (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.10), a strong local partner would be a boost for the company due to the perceived political risks. Yoma, which is largely in the real estate, consumer and automotive businesses in Myanmar, has experience in navigating the country\\u2019s complex land use laws and approval processes. This is imperative as securing sites and approvals to build towers is a lot tougher than securing funds, industry experts say. A written consent from Yoma\\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, YSH Finance Ltd, is one of the conditions necessary for the transfer of Digicel Group\\u2019s 75% stake to edotco. The deal also needs regulatory approvals in Myanmar, where mobile penetration is less than 50% in a country with over 51 million people. In Malaysia and Indonesia, where Axiata\\u2019s two largest operating companies are based, the mobile penetration rate is 145% and 126% respectively. It is worth noting that Axiata was among 13 shortlisted companies for a Myanmar telecoms licence in 2013 \\u2014 it lost to Norway\\u2019s Telenor ASA and Qatar\\u2019s Ooredoo. Telenor Myanmar Ltd, which on Sept 27 marked its first year of operation, said it had since July this year serve over 10 million customers with more than 3,100 towers across 13 major division/states. According to The Myanmar Times, Ooredoo has 2,500 towers covering 72% of the population and is looking to raise that to 90% by year end. To be sure, the Myanmar deal \\u2014 as with any foreign investment deals \\u2014 has its risks. Citing unnamed market sources, The Myanmar Times on May 18 said MTC had been put on the block with all its contracts and sites. According to the same article, MTC had a 2013 agreement with Ooredoo to build and lease 1,250 telecoms towers but unlike other tower companies, such as Irrawaddy Green Towers, MTC did not provide power to Ooredoo. This could not be independently verified at press time. Having gained over 10% since the Oct 2 announcement to close at RM6.38 last Friday, Axiata was among the top gainers last week \\u2014 its gains more than double the bellwether FBM KLCI\\u2019s over the same period. Analysts are largely neutral on Axiata, with 21 \\u201cholds\\u201d versus 10 \\u201cbuys\\u201d. Price targets range from RM6 to RM7.80, averaging at RM6.52, which implies limited upside in the near term. For now, analysts are not expecting any special dividends from Axiata, given guidance of capital expenditure staying high next year. In its Oct 2 statement, Axiata describes edotco as the first regional tower service provider in Asia, managing over 14,000 towers in the companies it operates in, \\u201cincluding Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Pakistan\\u201d. Axiata also operates in Indonesia and has associate stakes in India\\u2019s Idea Cellular Ltd and Singapore\\u2019s M1 Ltd, but these were not named in the statement. In October last year, Axiata\\u2019s 66.5%-owned Indonesian subsidiary, PT XL Axiata Tbk, was left with about 6,500 towers after it sold 3,500 communication towers to telecoms infrastructure firm PT Solusi Tunas Pratama Tbk for IDR5.6 trillion (US$460 million). XL is leasing them back for 10 years to pare its debt. It is understood that Indonesia\\u2019s regulation on foreign ownership of telecoms towers had complicated previous attempts to float Axiata\\u2019s global tower business. XL had previously said it could sell more towers. As it is, Axiata says the MTC deal will not materially impact its earnings for the current year ending Dec 31, but did not provide forward guidance in its Oct 2 statement. With some luck and plenty of hard work, Axiata\\u2019s newly acquired platform in Myanmar could turn into another cash cow for the group. In the meantime, however, analysts do not expect edotco to materially boost Axiata\\u2019s numbers for at least a year.

The Fed minutes revealed the extent to which policymakers are concern that a global economic slowdown might threaten the US economic outlook.

Recent softer economic data, like the latest American jobs data, has now created market expectations that US interest rates might not rise so soon.

The ringgit was much firmer against the US dollar at 4.2320 as Brent crude surged up to US$51.10 (RM215.64) per barrel.\\u00a0 The index rose on a rally from a low of 801.27 (October 2008) to its all-time high of 1,896.23 (July 2014), and this represents an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cflat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cpseudo-bull\\u201d rise completed. The next few months\\u2019 index price movements after July 2014 comprised key swings of 1,837.28 (low), 1,879.62 (high), 1,766.22 (low), 1,858.09 (high), 1,671.82 (low), 1,810.21 (high), 1,706.18 (low), 1,831.41 (high), 1,774.3 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,685.03 (low), 1,744.19 (high), 1,503.68 (low), 1,691.93 (high) and 1,595.22 (low). The index\\u2019s daily signals have all turned positive, with its CCI, DMI, MACD, Oscillator and Stochastic indicators showing emerging buy signals. As such, the index\\u2019s support levels are seen at 1,595, 1,647 and 1,692, while profit-taking in the resistance areas of 1,701, 1,744 and 1,795 may cap the index\\u2019s advances.

The index\\u2019s price bars are now between the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, and this depicts a neutral phase for the KLCI in the medium term. Due to the firmer tone for the KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Luxchem Corp Bhd. A check on the Bloomberg consensus reveals that one research house covers the stock fundamentally, with a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call.\\u00a0 Luxchem currently trades at a mildly high historical price-earnings ratio of 17.35 times. Its price-to-book value ratio of 2.44 times indicates that its share price is trading at a premium to its book value. Recently, there was no news on the stock that caused the share price to rise since early July. Luxchem\\u2019s chart trend in the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly up. Its share price has made an obvious surge since its major weekly Wave-2 low of 38 sen in September 2011. Since that 38 sen low, Luxchem has risen to its all-time high of RM1.62 this month. As prices broke above their recent key critical resistance levels of RM1.38 and RM1.40, look to buy Luxchem on any dips into its support areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to longer-term uptrend for the stock.\\u00a0 The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD, Stochastic and Oscillator) have issued clear buy signals and now depict firm indications of Luxchem\\u2019s eventual surge towards higher levels. It would attract firm buying activities at the support levels of RM1.38, RM1.40 and RM1.59. We expect Luxchem to witness some profit-taking in its resistance area and all-time high of RM1.62. Its upside targets are located at RM1.75, RM1.87, RM2.25, RM2.43 and RM2.57. Lee Cheng Hooi is the regional chartist at Maybank Kim Eng.

Stone Master Corp Bhd chief executive officer Professor Dr Wong Kong [email\\u00a0protected] Kong Yew has resigned from the loss-making marble and granite products manufacturer after completing his one-year assignment for the financial year of 2014/2015. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Stone Master also cited \\u201cto focus on his other business pursuits and commitments\\u201d as the reason for Wong\\u2019s resignation. Wong, 41, stepped down from Stone Master\\u2019s board as an executive director on Sept 30, which was earlier announced to Bursa on Sept 25. His resignation came after the company signed a slew of heads of agreement with China-based companies for the exclusive rights to distribute products under their brands in Malaysia and Singapore. The products range from wooden solid doors to environmentally friendly custom-made furniture and architectural aluminium doors. Lay Hong Bhd, which has seen its shares surge about 65% to its closing price of RM5.40 today since Aug 17, said it is in talks in relation to a possible joint venture (JV) project to invest in an integrated livestock business overseas. The JV has not been finalised at this juncture and both JV parties are finalising the principal terms before entering into any legal documentation, which has been targeted to be finalised in a month, Lay Hong revealed in its filing to Bursa today. It was replying to an unusual market activity enquiry issued by the regulator earlier today. Moreover, Lay Hong said it is in the midst of a discussion \\u201crelating to a few possible new foreign investors\\u201d, which is also yet to be finalised. \\u201cThe company had submitted a few proposals to the potential foreign investors and is currently waiting for their confirmation. The company expects to complete the negotiation within a month,\\u201d it said. It also intends to acquire the Thai unit of Takaso Resources Bhd, Takaso SC (Thailand) Ltd, as part of its business expansion in chicken and food processing to export to regional countries, at an indicative price of RM9 million, cash. It issued a letter of intent to Takaso on Sept 22, which has been accepted by Takaso today, with an announcement on the proposed transaction being made in an earlier filing on the same day. Lay Hong said that it will make the necessary announcements for all transactions in due course, in compliance with its obligations under the Main Market listing requirements of Bursa. The indicative consideration of RM9 million is approximately the total investment cost of Takaso since the acquisition of TSC on Nov 27, 2013, subject to the completion of the due diligence on TSC by Lay Hong. Separately, Takaso said TSC is currently dormant and was intended for the distribution and marketing of rubber related products and manufacturing and marketing of food business. The company, however, owns two factory buildings and a piece of land in Sadao District, Songkhla, Thailand. Takaso said the property was purchased for 25 million baht (RM3.02 million). In another statement, Bursa Malaysia said Takaso\\u2019s securities will be traded and quoted under the O&C Resources Bhd name effective Oct 7, 2015, while its warrants will also be re-named to O&C Resources Bhd-Warrants 2011/2016.

The claims include RM2.72 million in outstanding insurance premium, interest calculated on this sum at the rate of 8% per annum from Sept 30, 2014 to the date of full payment, cost of the action and other relief that the court deems fit. The case has been fixed for case management at the Kuala Lumpur High Court on Oct 12, 2015. PSSB is a wholly-owned subsidiary of loss-making Perwaja Holdings, which, in turn, is a 31.25%-owned associate of Kinsteel Bhd. Hub Shipping Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hubline Bhd, has been served with a winding-up petition by Textainer Equipment Management Ltd over claims amounting to US$3.73 million (RM16.47 million). In a Bursa filing, the winding-up petitions against Hub Shipping were presented at the Shah Alam High Court on Sept 25 by Textainer and a copy was served to the company today. Hubline alleged that Textainer is claiming an inflated amount, which includes items that Hub Shipping disputes. The marine shipping company said Hub Shipping has a container leasing contract with Textainer; and while Hub Shipping was under a restraining order related to Section 176(10A) of the Companies Act 1965, Textainer had on July 15, 2015 made a demand under the Companies Act 1965 for the payment of US$3.73 million. The restraining order was sought by Hub Shipping to prevent potential litigations or proceedings from creditors that may adversely affect the restructuring currently undertaken by the group, which is exiting the container shipping industry. As it is exiting the container shipping industry, it has already fully provided for the impairment of the total cost of investment in the subsidiary at RM102 million. Thus, the company is not expected to incur any further losses from the winding-up petition, Hubline said. The company is seeking legal advice to resolve and/or enter into defence. Case management of the matter has been fixed on Jan 8, 2016. Axiata Group Bhd plans to acquire a 75% stake in Digicel Asian Holdings Pte Ltd (DAH), a unit of Digicel Group Ltd (Digicel), to gain a controlling stake in Digicel Myanmar Tower Company Ltd (MTC). Axiata\\u2019s tower company edotco Group Sdn Bhd entered into a conditional share purchase agreement with Digicel today to effect the purchase of DAH, MTC\\u2019s holding company, said Axiata in a filing this evening. The transaction will be settled via cash after adjusting for external borrowing and other working capital requirements, of which, based on the expected closing date of Nov 30, 2015, is expected to be approximately US$125 million (RM551.3 million), it said. The transaction values MTC at an enterprise value of US$221 million (approximately RM974.7 million), in line with market benchmarks for similar assets, said Axiata. The deal, subject to the relevant regulatory approvals, will be financed by edotco\\u2019s and/or Axiata\\u2019s internally generated funds and/or external borrowings. The transaction will deliver to edotco strategic majority control providing a platform in a highly attractive tower industry within its geographic area of focus, and further solidify edotco as a leading infrastructure provider to the greater Southeast Asian telecommunications industry.

Lion Corp Bhd, which has fallen into Practice Note 17 status in Oct 2013, is in the midst of securing potential investors for its subsidiary as part of its regularisation plan. In a Bursa filing today, Lion Corp said its 78.89%-owned subsidiary Megasteel Sdn Bhd would be included in the regularisation plan. Megasteel is principally involved in the manufacturing and sale of hot rolled coils (HRC) and cold rolled coils. The company had been in the news of late when it cross defaulted on RM3.02 billion worth of loans. \\u201cThe company will continue to engage with potential investor(s) with a view to considering investment in Megasteel and in this respect, discussions have been initiated with a party from Northeast Asia and it is still ongoing,\\u201d said Lion Corp.

It plans to bring innovative products and end-to-end managed services that it offers in the Asian region, from towers and transmission to operations and maintenance and potentially energy, into Myanmar, it added. Axiata president and group chief executive officer Datuk Seri Jamaludin Ibrahim said the deal was in line with its long-term strategy to create new revenue streams apart from the core mobile business. \"The acquisition will enhance Axiata's tower infrastructure business significantly in a market outside the group's existing footprint,\" he said. Except for the material effect to the net assets, the transaction does not have any material effect on the earnings and gearing of Axiata Group for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2015. edotco was set up in 2012 to unlock the value of Axiata's tower and infrastructure assets by driving new levels of operational efficiency in passive infrastructure management and diversifying its revenue streams. It manages over 14,000 towers across its countries of operations including Malaysia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.

Furthermore, data from Moody\\u2019s Corp that showed six developing nations, including Malaysia and South Africa, deserve to follow Brazil into junk status further weighed down market sentiment. The FBM KLCI declined 2% in a week to 1,603.22 points yesterday. Trading volume continued to decline and this shows that the market is uncertain.

Technically, the trend is bearish in the long term as the index is below the long-term 200-day moving average and below the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. However, the trend is bullish in the short term but is at the crucial support level of the bullish trend. A breakout below 1,600 points could turn the trend bearish and thus continue its long-term bearish trend. Momentum indicators like the RSI and Momentum Oscillator have gone below their mid-levels and this indicates that the bears are in control. The MACD indicator is also starting to cross below its moving average. Furthermore, the KLCI is trading below the middle band of the Bollinger Bands indicator. Further declines could indicate a stronger bearish momentum and the index may fall lower. The KLCI has pulled back to a crucial support level of the short-term uptrend at 1,600 points. If the index rebounds from this level, the market may still hold and remain bullish in the short term. However, a breakout below 1,600 points could further hurt market sentiment and the index may continue to fall and test the support level at 1,500 points, which was tested last month.

According to former communications and multimedia minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Shabery Cheek, Malaysia\\u2019s e-commerce industry, which was worth RM53 billion in 2014, is expected to grow to RM72 billion this year and RM88 billion in 2016. As more and more consumers use the internet to make purchases, one of the biggest beneficiaries of this trend is the logistics industry, which is involved in the unglamorous back-end work of delivering the goods purchased. \\u201cThe rise of the online retail shopping segment \\u2014 both the business-to-consumer and customer-to-customer \\u2014 has been the driving force of the burgeoning courier service industry,\\u201d says RHB Research analyst Ahmad Maghfur Usman in a July 14 report. \\u201cWhile rising competition between online shopping companies could put pressure on costs and consequently, squeeze margins for courier service providers, on the upside, this could bring about more volume for courier service providers and, hence, drive economies of scale further.\\u201d While it is difficult to assess how much of what is being handled by courier companies is e-commerce-related, the general volume of parcels handled by the country\\u2019s postal and courier service industry has increased drastically over the last few years. Data from the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission shows that the postal service delivered 1.26 million parcels domestically last year, doubling 2013\\u2019s 662,681 deliveries. Courier traffic for parcels reached 15.29 million domestically last year, growing threefold from the 5.27 million parcels seen in 2012. Internationally, courier firms in Malaysia handled 4.07 million parcels last year, up from 1.83 million in 2012. More telling of e-commerce as a catalyst for the logistics industry, though, is the investment and capital expenditure courier companies are willing to undertake to capture a share of the e-commerce market. For example, Bursa Malaysia-listed GD Express Carrier Bhd (GDEX) (fundamental: 3; valuation: 0.70) incurred RM10.21 million in capital expenditure in its financial year ended June 30, 2014, to cope with greater demand for its delivery services. In that year, the company expanded its vehicle fleet from 297 to 453, increasing its capacity to 1,005 tonnes from 807 tonnes. It also increased its manpower from 2,013 workers to 2,315, to cope with the surge in demand for its express delivery services. GDEX\\u2019s express delivery segment posted a profit of RM24.48 million in FY2014, a 13.4% improvement from a year ago. The segment contributed 91% to the firm\\u2019s profit, with the remaining 9% coming from logistics services. According to GDEX managing director Teong Teck Lean, the company has been improving the quality of its services to fit into the business model of e-commerce firms in order to ride the boom. \\u201cThere are several factors that contributed to the growth of e-commerce. Retailers are embarking on different channels to reach out to their customers, and we believe that the internet is one of the channels they are focusing on. For new start-ups, selling through the internet is easier, as opposed to the traditional bricks-and-mortar retailing,\\u201d he says. \\u201cDelivery of goods to customers is one of the key factors of a successful e-commerce business, and we fit in perfectly as the service provider for these players. E-commerce-related business contributes about 15% to our revenue and is growing rapidly. The volume growth is very encouraging.\\u201d Similarly, Pos Malaysia Bhd (fundamental: 2.20: valuation: 0.90), which has seen an erosion of profits from its core mail business due to declining mail volume, is now spending more on growing its courier, express and parcel (CEP) business. This segment, which contributed 30% or RM480 million to the company\\u2019s revenue in its financial year ended March 31, 2015, has been growing in tandem with the increase in e-commerce transactions. Pos Malaysia group CEO Azlan Shahrim has also described the CEP segment as the main driver of the company\\u2019s growth. This explains the concerted effort made by the company to improve its Pos Laju services. Pos Laju has expanded its physical courier infrastructure by providing ad hoc kiosks, commenced operating on the first Saturday of each month and on public holidays and invested in fuel-efficient vehicles, mobile scanners and a bigger workforce to ensure it keeps its courier market share. It has also introduced innovative products like EZiPoz \\u2014 a reverse logistics service to complement e-commerce transactions. EZiPoz provides online shoppers in Malaysia with a street address in the US, allowing them to buy from retailers that do not ship their products outside the US. Even for those who are not in the courier business yet, the e-commerce-related revenue is starting to look tempting. \\u201cE-commerce is something we are looking into closely,\\u201d says Tiong Nam Logistics Holdings Bhd, which has expertise in warehousing and customs forwarding. \\u201cAs a total logistics solution provider with our extensive expertise in door-to-door micro-distribution deliveries, Tiong Nam (fundamental: 1.10; valuation: 2.40) will definitely take advantage of this trend to provide a healthy supply chain for deliveries.\\u201d Other players that have been touted as potential newcomers to the last-mile delivery market by analysts are TASCO Bhd (fundamental: 1.80; valuation: 1.40), Freight Management Holdings Bhd (fundamental: 1.40; valuation: 1.80) and Ingenuity Consolidated Bhd (fundamental: 0.95; valuation: 0.90). With just about anything a click away for consumers, the logistics industry will do well to ride the e-commerce boom.

The index\\u2019s daily signals have turned mixed, with its CCI, DMI and Stochastic indicators showing sell signals, but the MACD and Oscillator are positive for now. As such, the index\\u2019s weaker support levels are seen at the 1,503, 1,567 and 1,609 levels, while profit-taking in the resistance areas of 1,613, 1,661 and 1,691 will cap the index\\u2019s advances. The KLCI\\u2019s 18-day and 40-day simple moving averages (SMAs) depict an emerging downtrend for its short-term daily chart. The index\\u2019s price bars are also below the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, and this depicts a softer phase for the medium- to longer-term moving averages. Due to the softer tone of the KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201csell\\u201d on UMW Holdings Bhd (UMW). A check on the Bloomberg consensus reveals that 18 research houses cover the stock, with no \\u201cbuy\\u201d call, 10 \\u201chold\\u201d calls and eight \\u201csell\\u201d calls. Maybank Investment Bank\\u2019s analyst has a \\u201chold\\u201d call on UMW, with a sum-of-parts-based target price of RM7.80 as its first half of financial year 2015 (FY15) earnings of RM225 million were below expectations. The key disappointments in its second quarter of FY15 earnings were in the auto and oil and gas (O&G) divisions, where higher US dollar-denominated costs hit the auto division and underutilisation of its jack-up rigs affected the O&G division. UMW\\u2019s chart trends in the daily, weekly and monthly time frames are very firmly down. Its share price made an obvious plunge since its major weekly Wave-5 high of RM12.23 in August 2014. Since that RM12.23 high, UMW\\u2019s share price fell to its recent low of RM7.70 this month. As prices broke above its recent key critical support levels of RM9.72 and RM8.84, look to sell UMW on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to medium-term downtrend for this stock. The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI and Oscillator) have issued clear sell signals, and now depict firm indications of UMW\\u2019s eventual plunge to lower levels. It would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of RM7.77, RM8.84 and RM9.72. We expect UMW to witness weak buying in its support areas of RM6.74, RM7.02 and RM7.70. Its downside targets are located at RM5.85, RM4.55 and RM1.98.  Lee Cheng Hooi is the regional chartist at Maybank Kim Eng.

Besides that, he said it is still business as usual for these companies, as there were no other news or surprises for the telco sector. \\u201cThe competition between the players is still there. It\\u2019s all business as usual, as they continue to roll out their 4G LTE network and their network modernisation plans. \\u201cThere\\u2019s heightened competition now, but that has been prevalent over the past few months,\\u201d he said. On the other hand, Alia Arwina, analyst with RHB Research Institute Sdn Bhd, attributed the correction in telco stocks to rotational play by investors. \\u201cI don\\u2019t see any specific reason for the decline, but it could be due to rotational play by investors.

In a note today, CIMB said the spotlight was on the RM20 billion allocation for government-owned Valuecap Sdn Bhd to buy undervalued shares here. \"The measures announced by the PM\\u00a0 have two broad objectives, i.e. stabilise financial markets and support domestic businesses. Just like any other measure to\\u00a0 support a beleaguered stock market, the impact was immediate and the ringgit recovered slightly. \\u201cThe measures to support the real economy pale in comparison, given the size of funds. The intended impact on the markets may not last, amidst prevalent volatility.\\u00a0 Any sustained positive effects would be reflected more in the domestic real economy; albeit marginally and with a time lag,\" CIMB said. According to Valuecap's website, the company is equally-owned by Khazanah Nasional Bhd, Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) and Permodalan Nasional Bhd. Valuecap operates via two subsidiaries. They are VCAP Asset Managers Sdn Bhd \\u2014 a conventional fund management entity; and i-VCAP Management Sdn Bhd, which manages funds based on Islamic principals. Yesterday (Sept 14), Najib also announced measures to strengthen the domestic economy. These include establishing more goverment-owned convenience stores and clinics and encouraging Malaysian companies abroad to repatriate their profits and invest the money here. Today, CIMB said the economic measures were not enough to catalyse the domestic economy, as consumers contended with the impact of the goods and services tax (GST) and weakening ringgit. Both factors have led to costlier goods here. \\u201cAs the economy is not facing any threat of a sharp slowdown like that seen in the last global financial crisis and asian financial crisis, the government is not under pressure to act with big economic stimulus. \"Nonetheless, with the rapid decline in the ringgit, some businesses, especially the SMEs, are feeling the pinch at a time when they are still struggling with costs associated with the GST. Hence, the measures announced are more targeted towards this group,\" CIMB said. Meanwhile, Hong Leong Investment Bank said in its note that value big cap stocks could be in focus, following Najib's announcement yesterday. Hong Leong said the list included Axiata Group Bhd, DiGi.Com Bhd, IJM Corp Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd. \"This would expedite our expectation of switch in focus to value big caps (albeit yesterday\\u2019s surge). \"Repatriation of GLCs (government-linked companies) funds could result in more stable MYR, culminating in lower appetite for export-oriented stocks,\" Hong Leong said.

These launches are: two residential projects \\u2014 one each in Ara Damansara and Cheras \\u2014 and a commercial project in Shah Alam. Lim also said Titijaya is changing its land banking strategy by embarking on developments through partnerships to share risks and preserve cash flow. As at FY16, the group has a total land bank of 432 acres, valued at RM8.6 billion. Symphony Life Bhd said performance for current financial year ending March 31, 2016 (FY16) would be worse than the previous year due to slower demand. Chief operating officer Stewart Tew said Symphony Life was holding back a part of the RM2 billion worth of real estate launches in the Klang Valley to focus on existing projects, in view of the current market. Tew said many existing projects were at the foundation stage. \\u201cHence, we can only realise the contribution next year. We are deferring some of our launches, due to the weakening of the property sector lately. \\u201cThe group is also actively on the lookout for new land bank for future development,\\u201d he told reporters after the company\\u2019s annual general meeting here today. Tew said Symphony Life\\u2019s deferred launches included projects in Bandar Sunway and Puchong, Selangor. The launches have been postponed until next year or 2017, according to him. Property developer Land and General Bhd (L&G) said the weakening ringgit against the US dollar will increase the development cost for their future projects by up to 20%, if the situation does not abate soon. \\u201cCosts have been going up progressively over the past two years. The past six months\\u2019 development has seen the weakening ringgit and this will impact future contracts awarded as part of the construction materials, some imported raw items or finishing items are quoted in US dollars. \\u201cHowever, I don\\u2019t think the cost increase will be too drastic \\u2026 it would be somewhere around 10% to 15% range, at most 20%. The bulk of the raw materials used for construction is locally produced. Cement and steel bar are price controlled items. So most of our cost is local,\\u201d said L&G MD Low Gay Teck. He said its current projects are unaffected. On whether the group will pass the price hike to their customers, Low only said it will \\u201cadjust the price cost accordingly\\u201d. Meanwhile, it does not see major concerns for its ongoing projects. \\u201cEven in hard times, I don\\u2019t foresee major concerns for the group, because we can sell.

Take Press Metal Bhd, for example. The group recognised RM97 million in unrealised foreign exchange loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 because of RM1.26 billion in US dollar-denominated debts. The group\\u2019s foreign currency borrowings make up almost 68% of gross debts. Without the foreign exchange losses, profit before tax would have been RM167.2 million, instead of RM70.2 million. However, the exchange losses that companies will be booking are only paper losses for the time being \\u2014 hence, they are booked as an \\u201cunrealised loss\\u201d. Operationally, Press Metal\\u2019s earnings are improving, up from RM40.6 million the previous year as it recovers from the forced shutdown of the Mukah smelting plant. The higher interest rates on US dollar-denominated borrowings shouldn\\u2019t present a problem either, as Press Metal\\u2019s receivables are primarily in US dollars, too, and will act as a natural hedge. That said, the ringgit has weakened by 10% since March 31, which means more foreign exchange losses. Yet, Press Metal\\u2019s over RM1 billion in US dollar-denominated debt is in fact relatively small compared with the conglomerates that are listed on Bursa Malaysia. The sheer size of debts taken on by these giants (see Table 1) might seem alarming, but most of them have relatively reliable cash flows. This is unlike in 1998, when most companies were financially stressed because of the mismatch between ringgit revenue and foreign currency-denominated loans. Take YTL Corp Bhd, its subsidiary YTL Power International Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) and Malakoff Corp Bhd. These utility companies have high borrowings but they have steady cash flow. While these utilities may have to bear some foreign currency losses in the near term, their cash flows from operations should be sufficient to cover their debt obligations. YTL Power (fundamental: 1.20; valuation: 2.40) and Malakoff have the added advantage of not being exposed to fluctuations in fuel costs that TNB bears. That said, TNB (fundamental: 1.30; valuation: 2.40) gets AAA ratings for its borrowings because it controls a structural monopoly of the transmission and distribution of electricity. When it comes to high debt levels, the real concern is over companies whose businesses could be disrupted by a sudden downturn in the business cycle, or those that have a big mismatch between the currency of revenue and the currency of their debts \\u2014 airlines, for instance. Over 80% of AirAsia Bhd\\u2019s (fundamental: 0.20; valuation: 1.40) RM11.81 billion debts were in US dollars as at December 2014. Since the beginning of this year, the ringgit has depreciated 15% to 4.02 against the US dollar. \\u201cThe weakening ringgit creates a headache for AirAsia. However, low jet fuel prices will be a Panadol to help ease the headache,\\u201d notes Maybank Investment Bank Aviation analyst Mohshin Aziz. In the first quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1QFY2015), AirAsia saw an unrealised loss on foreign exchange of RM536.1 million arising from its borrowings. Fortunately, due to the group\\u2019s hedging, the net foreign exchange loss was RM350.1 million, including RM11.13 million in realised foreign exchange losses. AirAsia had hedged 43% of its US dollar-denominated borrowings. While the low-cost carrier\\u2019s bottom line will be hit by losses on foreign currency translation, it should not affect the company\\u2019s core earnings, says Mohshin. \\u201cOf course, there will be a translation loss, but we don\\u2019t look at it when it comes to core earnings. The US dollar borrowings that AirAsia has are for 12 years or more ... plenty of time for the ringgit to rebound,\\u201d he points out. In the meantime, AirAsia\\u2019s cash flow should cover the higher interest rate payments on these borrowings, he says. AirAsia\\u2019s load factors rebounded to 80.1% in 2QFY15 following the loss of Indonesia AirAsia\\u2019s flight QZ8501 late last year, which caused a fall in ticket sales in 1Q. SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 0.80) is the only non-utility in the top five companies with the most borrowings. The oil and gas services provider has over RM15.56 billion in net debt, a net gearing of 128%. It has over RM13.9 billion in US dollar-denominated debts or 81.6% of gross debts. In the near term, foreign exchange losses are expected to eat into SapuraKencana\\u2019s earnings. On the bright side, most of its revenue is denominated in US dollars, which is normal in the oil and gas industry, thus neutralising the foreign currency risk. It is common for oil and gas companies to have high US dollar-denominated debts. Perdana Petroleum Bhd and Perisai Petroleum Teknologi Bhd have 96% and 98% of their debts denominated in US dollars, respectively. However, both Perdana (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 0.80) and Perisai (fundamental: 0.30; valuation: 1.70) have lower levels of gearing than SapuraKencana \\u2014 0.87 and 0.92 times respectively. It is important to note that SapuraKencana also has a much stronger earnings pipeline to support its debts, for now. The group has a decent order book of RM25 billion. The challenge, however, will be in sustaining order book replenishment, with crude oil prices averaging US$59.93 a barrel this year. Perisai, which also provides offshore support services, saw a\\u00a0 77% decline in its core net profit to RM2 million in the second quarter this year. Perdana posted a 71% drop in core net profit to RM6 million due to lower utilisation of its vessels. Nevertheless, jobs have not dried up completely. SapuraKencana last month won a RM1 billion contract from India\\u2019s Oil and Natural gas Corp Ltd. Still, SapuraKencana has high expectations to meet when it comes to order book replenishment. Analysts expect the group to bag RM6 billion to RM8 billion in new contracts this year. With oil majors scaling back exploration and production, this will put pressure on the company\\u2019s heavily geared balance sheet going forward if the situation does not improve. In contrast, most of the other companies on the list (Table 1) have relatively sheltered revenue streams. Axiata Group Bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.10), Maxis Bhd (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 1.10), and Telekom Malaysia Bhd (fundamental: 0.80; valuation: 1.10) have high borrowings to fund their initial capital expenditure. However, with telecommunications an everyday necessity, it is unlikely their earnings will take a big hit in the event of an economic slowdown. In fact, such companies are valued as defensive stocks when there is a slowdown. \\u00a0 Group exposure Interestingly, many of these companies with high foreign currency borrowings are government-linked corporations. (see Table 2). The Khazanah Nasional group of companies has racked up over RM41.67 billion in net debt. With the exception of UEM Sunrise Bhd (fundamental: 1.50, valuation: 2.60), most of the companies would be considered to have stable cash flows. Still, UEM Sunrise\\u2019s gearing is relatively low at 0.27 times. Furthermore, the group has a vast landbank, which can be sold to support its debts. Hence, while the debts seem high, the Khazanah companies should be able to weather the volatility and service their debts. Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Albukhary\\u2019s group of companies has a different risk profile. MMC Corp Bhd is heavily vested in construction, which tends to be a cyclical industry that seems to have reached the peak of the cycle. At least MMC (fundamental: 0.40, valuation: 2) has been able to reduce its gearing substantially since Malakoff ceased to be its 51%-held subsidiary post-listing, allowing MMC to deconsolidate Malakoff\\u2019s debts from its books. DRB-Hicom Bhd, however, may be a concern to Syed Mokhtar. The latest available total industry volume figures show a sharp decline in automotive sales this year. Proton, which is under DRB-Hicom, was no exception with year-to-date sales falling 23% to 32,652 units as at April. The silver lining for DRB-Hicom is that there has been a 27% increase in sales volume for Honda cars, which the group assembles. Other marques that DRB-Hicom assembles include Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen. However, with consumer confidence hitting new lows, softer automotive sales could pose a challenge for DRB-Hicom, especially if it allows inventories to build up. Moving forward, volatility isn\\u2019t all doom and gloom for investors. While the weakness of the ringgit will hurt the bottom lines of some companies, it will also create opportunities for long-term investors who have confidence in the underlying fundamentals of companies and their resilience in a down cycle.

Boustead Plantations Bhd's net profit for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 surged over four-fold to RM48.6 million from RM9.46 million a year earlier, due to a one-off land disposal gain of RM39.1 million. Put the land disposal gain aside, its operating profit in the current quarter under review and year-to-date was lower compared to last year due to the decline in fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production, bearish palm product prices and lower volume of crude palm oil (CPO) sales. Quarterly revenue fell 18.73% to RM153.38 million from RM188.73 million a year earlier. The plantation group declared a second interim dividend of five sen per share in respect of the financial year ending Dec 31, 2015, payable on Sept 29. Year-to-date, it has declared a seven sen dividend as compared to two sen last year. For the cumulative six months (1HFY15), the group posted a 41.43% increase in net profit to RM55.95 million against RM39.56 million last year. Revenue for the period declined 26.35% to RM285.26 million from RM387.3 million in 1HFY14. Axiata Group Bhd recorded a 34.2% increase in net profit for its second financial quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2QFY15) to RM610.76 million or 7.1 sen per share from RM455.01 million or 5.3 sen per share in 2QFY14, mainly due to lower losses from its Indonesian operations, PT XL Axiata Tbk, arising from lower foreign exchange losses and net finance costs. Axiata (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.1) said higher profits were also recorded by its Sri Lanka operations Dialog Axiata PLC and Cambodia operations Smart Axiata Co Ltd, and share of profits from its associate company in India, Idea Cellular Ltd, had also increased significantly. The group has also proposed an interim dividend of 8 sen per share. In terms of revenue, Axiata reported 2QFY15 revenue of RM4.71 billion, a marginal decrease of 0.5% compared to last year when it reported a revenue of RM4.73 billion, dragged by lower revenues in Malaysia and Indonesia. For its first half ended June 30, 2015 (1HFY15) Axiata reported a 5.8% increase in net profit to RM1.2 billion, from RM1.13 billion in 1HFY14, mainly due to higher profits from its Sri Lanka and Cambodia operations. Revenue for 1HFY15 also increased by 2.3% to RM9.46 billion, from RM9.25 billion a year ago, on higher revenue from Sri Lanka and Cambodia. Axiata also plan to reduce its foreign borrowing exposure by restructuring its Indonesia unit, XL\\u2019s US$590million to local currencies and it was at the last stage of signing document. Its total US-denominated borrowings stand at US$823million. Dialog Group Bhd's net profit jumped 21.8% to RM63.63 million or 1.26 sen per share for its fourth financial quarter ended June 30, 2015 (4QFY15) from RM52.24 million or 1.06 sen per share a year ago, mainly driven by its Malaysia operation. Revenue for the quarter, however, declined 10.6% to RM576.58 million against RM643.73 million, dragged down by its international business and lower share of joint ventures (JV) results. Dialog \\u00a0(fundamental: 2.5; valuation: 1.1) \\u00a0also declared a final dividend of 1.2 sen per share for the financial year ended \\u00a0June 30, 2015 (FY15). This brings the total cash dividend for the current financial year to 2.2 sen amounting to RM111.76 million. For the full FY15, Dialog saw its net profit grow 27.5% to RM275.13 million or 5.54 sen a share from RM215.87 million or 4.41 sen a share the previous year. This was despite revenue weakening by 7.45% to RM2.36 billion in FY15 from RM2.55 billion in FY14.\\u00a0 WCT Holdings Bhd (fundamental: 0.6; valuation: 1.4) also reported a 9.5% decrease in net profit for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2QFY15) to RM31.06 million from RM34.3 million in 2QFY14, mainly due to lower contribution from overseas projects and its property development segment. However, WCT\\u2019s revenue was 5.2% higher at RM422.31 million against RM401.47 million a year ago. The group is also proposing an interim single-tier dividend comprising a cash dividend of one sen per ordinary share, and a share dividend via a distribution of treasury shares on the basis of one treasury share for every one hundred ordinary shares held, fractions of treasury shares to be disregarded. The interim dividend will be payable and credited into the entitled Depositors\\u2019 Securities Account on Oct 9, 2015.

Its latest quarterly revenue expanded 13.9% to RM255.02 million, from RM223.88 million a year ago, mainly due to higher trading volumes, particularly in its radio frequency business, on the continued rise in demand for smartphones and mobile devices.

Meanwhile, cumulative revenue increased 17.6% to RM933.10 million.\n\\u00a0\nMeanwhile, Notion VTec \\u00a0(fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 0.9) recorded an almost six-fold increase in net profit for its third financial quarter ended June 30, 2015 (3QFY15) to RM7.28 million, or 2.71 per share, from RM1.27 million, or 0.47 sen per share a year ago. Its stellar performance was attributed to an extraordinary gain of RM8.9 million arising from the sale of a factory building and land, the group said in its filing to the exchange today. Notion VTec, which manufactures high volume precision components and tools for hard disk drive and single lens reflex (SLR) camera industries, reported a 19% increase in revenue to RM62.09 million in 3QFY15, from RM52.19 million a year ago, due to higher revenue from camera parts. For the nine months ended June 30, 2015 (9MFY15), Notion VTec\\u2019s net loss narrowed to RM2.51 million or 0.94 sen per share compared with RM16.12 million, or 6.01 sen per share last year due to its divestment gain coupled with a higher average selling price arising from the strengthening of the US dollar against the ringgit. The group also recorded a nearly 28% increase in revenue to RM184.28 million in 9MFY15, from RM144.1 million in the same period last year. Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd, whose share price is hovering near the record high level, announced its net profit grew 37% to RM47.44 million for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2QFY15), from RM34.59 million in the previous corresponding quarter, driven by the same quantum increase in its sale quantity in the quarter under review. Other than higher glove sales, Kossan (fundamental: 2.1; valuation: 0.5) told Bursa Malaysia that better product mix and improved operational efficiency also helped to boost its profitability. The group\\u2019s quarterly revenue expanded nearly 27% to RM385.78 million in 2QFY15, from RM303.83 million a year ago. For the first six months ended June 30, Kossan\\u2019s net profit increased 30% to RM92.89 million, from RM71.43 million last year; while its revenue grew almost 24% to RM755.04 million, from RM610 million. Gabungan AQRS Bhd, whose share price slipped to record low of 84 sen today, saw its net profit shrunk 61% to RM5.44 million for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2QFY15); revenue also down 34.5% to RM85.88 million, due to lower revenue contribution from construction and property development segment. For the cumulative six months (1HFY15) ended June 30, Gabungan AQRS (fundamental:1.1; valuation: 0.9)\\u2019s net profit and revenue respectively dropped by 55.8% to RM11.54 million and 31% to RM191.27 million. Pipe manufacturer Engtex Group Bhd reported a net profit of RM14.73 million or 4.97 sen a share for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2QFY15), a slight 0.88% lower from RM14.86 million or 5.04 sen a share a year ago, on weakened revenue. Engtex (fundamental: 0.9; valuation: 1.8)said revenue for the period slipped 10.7% to RM299.38 million from RM331.28 million in 2QFY14, due to the temporary softening of demand for certain metal-related trading products after the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) on April 1. For the six-month period (6MFY15), net profit increased to RM28.24 million, 11.6% higher from RM25.31 million a year ago, as the group saw increased market demand for certain metal-related trading products and manufactured steel products. Revenue for the period also increased 2.4% to RM605.77 million, from RM591.57 million in 6MFY14. Information and communications technology service provider Prestariang Bhd saw its net profit fall nearly 28% to RM5.09 million its second quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2QFY15) despite an increase of revenue by 20.5% to RM35million. The drop of net profit was a because the group had taken on more low margin businesses, while higher revenue was due to extension and renewal of the Master Licensing Agreement 2.0 by Ministry of Finance to distribute Microsoft software to all government departments and agencies until Jan 31, 2018. Prestariang (fundamental: 3.0; valuation: 0.5) declared a second interim dividend of one sen per share in respect of FY15. For the first half of FY15 (1HFY15), the group\\u2019s net profit fell 32% to RM9.1 million, from RM13.44 million previously, although its revenue came in higher at RM75.03 million, up 51% from RM49.64 million during 1HFY14. Low-cost carrier AirAsia Bhd\\u2019s net profit dropped 33.8% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM243.03 million or 8.7 sen per share in its second quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2QFY15), mainly due to unrealised foreign exchange (forex) loss on borrowings from a strong US dollar. AirAsia (fundamental: 0.2; valuation: 2) said the unrealised forex loss of RM43.59 million was due to adverse movement in the exchange rate on US dollar-denominated borrowings and noted that ringgit was trading at 3.6717 as at June 30, compared with 3.2298 as at June 30 a year ago. Further, a one-off costs related to the sale of leaseback of aircraft had also impacted its earnings this quarter, it said. Meanwhile, its latest quarterly revenue came in 1.06% higher at RM1.32 billion, compared with RM1.31 billion in 2QFY14, on the back of a 7% y-o-y growth in the number of passengers carried \\u2014 in line with its capacity growth, saw it recording an 80% load factor, consistent with the same period last year. For the six months period (1HFY15), the group\\u2019s net profit fell 22.6% to RM392.36 million from RM506.87 million in 1HFY14, again largely due to unrealised forex loss on borrowings. Revenue, however, improved 0.3% to RM2.62 billion from RM2.61 billion a year ago. Malaysian infrastructure conglomerate YTL Corp Bhd saw a 15.6% decline in net profit to RM298.93 million or 2.87 sen a share, for its fourth quarter ended June 30, 2015 (4QFY15), from RM354.07 million or 3.42 sen a share a year ago, amidst wider loss in hotel division and lower contribution from property development. This came on the back of lower revenue of RM4.11 billion, which fell 10.63% from RM4.6 billion last year. The group declared an interim single tier dividend of 9.5 sen per share, payable on Oct 23. \\u00a0 For the full year, YTL's (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 1.4) net profit stood at RM1.07 billion or 10.27 sen a share, down nearly 31% from the RM1.55 billion on lower contribution from cement manufacturing and trading, property investment and development and utilities. FY15 revenue was also lower at RM16.82 billion, a 12.7% decrease from RM19.27 million a year ago.

I am delighted to be here this morning to speak at this Renminbi Forum. The renminbi sphere has indeed extended beyond the Asian region, extending to other continents, to Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. The renminbi is no longer an Asian story, but it has now become a global story. It reflects China's importance and influence in the changing contour of the global economic and financial landscape, and the steps that have been taken to enhance its international role. My remarks today will focus on the increasing trend of the internationalisation of the renminbi despite the recent challenges faced in the Chinese economy; the implications of this trend to the region and finally on the steps that Malaysia has taken as the region transitions into this environment. Long-term Prospects for the Chinese Economy and the Renminbi After decades of rapid growth, the Chinese economy is now transitioning to a growth path that is more sustainable. It is important to recognise that the moderation in the Chinese economy has been in part, policy-driven, through conscious reforms to restructure the economy to become more balanced and domestic demand-centric. These economic reforms have been accompanied by financial and exchange rate reforms, geared towards modernising the economy and financial system that is increasingly more integrated with the global economy. These reforms are mutually reinforcing as the transformation of the structure of the Chinese economy is necessary to support its integration with the world economy and the international financial system. The commitment to these reforms is crucial in securing the long-term growth prospects for China, even as the Chinese economy faces short-term challenges in the recent period. The recent one-off adjustment of the renminbi reflects a conscious effort by China to align the renminbi to a market-driven mechanism as a part of a crucial reform to allow the renminbi to reflect financial market developments and economic fundamentals. In an environment of continued weakness in global trade, these short-term challenges include managing the ongoing corrections in the real estate sector, leverage in the financial system and more recently, the volatility in the stock market. While these uncertainties may generate concerns over the renminbi in the near term, it needs to be recognised that the long-term growth prospects for China remain intact, and that this will continue to strengthen the foundations that will support the transition of the renminbi as an international reserve currency. China has a high rate of savings, healthy external position, an inherent competitive mass manufacturing advantage and a large educated workforce to sustain its long-term potential economic growth. Importantly, the narrative of the global future of China cannot be explained in isolation \\u2014 it is part of a broader account of the growing importance and greater integration of Asia, and the stronger interlinkages with other emerging economies in the global economic landscape. China and the region are becoming more than just global exporters.\\u00a0 The increased efforts are seen in the steps to develop more extensive investment and financial linkages in the region as well as the rest of the world through key strategic initiatives such as the One Belt One Road initiative, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank. Reflecting its expanding role in the global economy and the international financial system, the renminbi will assume greater strategic importance in facilitating the development of these new investment and financial linkages, including meeting the greater demand for infrastructure spending. This is also reinforced by the transition of Asia from a global producer to a global consumer thus becoming an important driver of growth in the world economy. The rise of the renminbi is often associated with expectations of rapid capital account liberalisation. In this regard, the historical experience of the major currencies over the recent fifty years holds important lessons for the renminbi. Many advanced economies continued to retain significant capital account restrictions until early 1980s, later than the internationalisation process of their currencies that began in earlier decades. Such evidence suggests that the transition of the renminbi as an international currency can commence with the gradual and sequential liberalisation of the capital account. China's position on a 'managed convertibility' approach instead of the traditional 'fully or freely convertible' can therefore be appreciated given the lessons from the Global Financial Crisis and the risks associated with volatile capital flows even for such a large emerging economy like China. It is important to note that China has made significant progress in this area. This is even acknowledged by the IMF in its recent reports as they note that China has already achieved full or partial convertibility in 35 out of 40 items under the capital account. The rise of the renminbi and its implications While the path for the renminbi to be a fully international currency will remain gradual, the renminbi has already achieved significant milestones. It is now the second most used currency globally for trade finance and the fifth most used currency for global payments. One-quarter of China's total trade is now invoiced in renminbi, and this is expected to double within the next five years. By some accounts, more than sixty central banks around the world already hold renminbi in their official reserves. The rise of the renminbi as an international currency would facilitate trade, investment and financial activities that are commensurate with the continued growing importance of China in the global landscape. Of significance to the Asian region, the rising importance of the renminbi will reinforce the trend towards greater regional financial and economic integration. China is already the main trading partner for most economies in the region. The increased usage of the renminbi and the more developed regional financial markets for the renminbi provides an opportunity to recycle savings within the region and thus support the increased intra-regional investment activities. More renminbi-based trade within the region will create pools of renminbi liquidity which would create a demand for instruments which would in turn spur the development of more efficient and integrated renminbi capital markets in the region that can contribute towards better intermediation between the surplus and deficit units in the region.\n\\u00a0\nIn addition, the renminbi can be a source of stability for the global monetary system. The increasing use and recognition of the renminbi as an international reserve asset will strengthen the foundations of the current global monetary system that is currently reliant on too few major currencies. With the increased economic and financial interconnectivity in the world today and the greater potential for international policy spillovers, a more multipolar global monetary system with more diverse sources of global liquidity would contribute towards a more stable international financial system. Looking ahead, these developments present tremendous opportunities for the private sector. Indeed, trade invoicing in renminbi has already begun to spread beyond predominantly Chinese enterprises to multinational companies (MNCs) turning to China as a key market for their products and services. Notably, despite the initial difficulties in operationalising the renminbi-based system, some MNCs have successfully upgraded their global invoicing and payment systems to settle trade and working capital in renminbi with their Chinese counterparts. This allows for significant cost-savings on foreign exchange transactions in addition to efficiency gains from matching trade receipts to funding working capital requirements. The increased use of the renminbi for their investment activities in China is supported by the flexibility provided in China for movements of global funds in and out of the country. The potential longer-term benefits from using the renminbi-based system for their trade, working capital requirements and FDI in China is thus seen to clearly outweigh the implementation costs. In the more recent decade, financial investments have also gathered momentum as foreign investors commenced investment activities in Chinese financial markets since 2003 through the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) program. Wide-ranging measures, including the introduction of China Interbank Bond Market (CIBM) foreign quota in 2009, the Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) in 2011 and the operationalisation of the Hong Kong-Shanghai Stock Connect in 2014, are all aimed at encouraging greater participation of foreign investors in China's mainland financial markets. At the same time, China is improving the global renminbi settlement and clearing system through a wider network of renminbi clearing banks and the upcoming Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) to lower the transaction costs for the renminbi relative to other major currencies. Currently, there are at least five hundred global investors, including sixty or more foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds, that have gained direct access to China's financial markets. Many more have access through the Hong Kong-Shanghai Stock Connect. Malaysian institutional investors seeking to internationally diversify their investments would need to intensify the learning curve process in the Chinese financial markets to realise its benefits. Malaysia: A pioneer in the cross-border use of the renminbi Malaysia was one of the earliest countries to recognize the potential role of the greater cross-border use of renminbi. Given China's significance as Malaysia's largest trading partner, the settlement of trade and investment in renminbi significantly lowers costs and promotes greater cross-border trade and investment activity. In turn, fund-raising activity in renminbi has become a means for Malaysia to utilise the renminbi liquidity obtained through trade settlements. Malaysia has a comparative advantage in this area, as the largest debt securities market in Southeast Asia and as a leading centre for sukuk issuance. As an early pioneer of renminbi initiatives, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) was the first ASEAN central bank to sign a currency swap agreement with the People's Bank of China (PBC) in February 2009. In the same year, BNM was also the first Asian central bank to become a QFII investor and among the first wave of foreign investors in CIBM. In 2010, the Malaysian ringgit became the first emerging currency to be directly traded with the renminbi in the China Foreign Exchange Trading System (CFETS). In 2013, BNM signed a Cross-Border Collateral Arrangement (CBCA) with PBC to enable the use of home currency collateral to obtain domestic liquidity in the host country. In November 2014, BNM signed an MOU on a renminbi clearing bank arrangement. The Bank of China Malaysia was appointed as the renminbi clearing bank in January 2015. Going forward, BNM will work towards further enhancing financial co-operation with PBC in the area of Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) to provide an alternative avenue for Malaysian investors to invest in onshore Chinese financial markets. BNM has also worked to integrate the renminbi into the domestic financial system by incorporating the renminbi in Malaysia's Real Time Gross Settlement System (RENTAS). In November 2013, BNM introduced the Renminbi Liquidity Facility (RLF) to licensed onshore banks to facilitate more effective renminbi liquidity management in Malaysia. Today, the usage of renminbi in Malaysia has grown rapidly, with the daily size of renminbi foreign exchange volume at RMB6.7 billion. Malaysian institutions and corporations such as Khazanah, Cagamas, Axiata and Maybank have issued renminbi bonds. With the various renminbi financial infrastructure that has been put in place to support trade, investment and financial flows between Malaysia and China, this trend is expected to increase. Malaysian entities with large regional network should consider using Malaysia as the centre for their regional renminbi transactions and thus contribute towards greater economies of scale over time. This would in turn enable the transactions to be conducted in the most efficient and cost effective way. Conclusion Let me conclude my remarks. In a short time span of six years since 2009, the renminbi has accomplished much of its goals but there is still a long journey ahead as most international currencies have evolved over several decades. The impact of the Chinese economy on Asia has been significant with many countries now counting China as their largest trading partner, and in some cases, among the largest foreign investors. Reflective of the underlying fundamental economic changes, the rise of the renminbi, although gradual, is inevitable with important implications not only to Asia but to the rest of the world. Undoubtedly, the renminbi is more important to Asia than anywhere else. Given this, Asia including Malaysia must be ready for this transition of the increased internationalisation of the renminbi and its potential role with Asia's integration path and thus contributing towards further unlocking the potential of the region. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 Bank Negara Malaysia\nAugust 17, 2015 \\u00a0"}, "334": {"date_posted": "11/8/2015", "title": "Maybank IB sees opportunities amid volatility", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: Despite internal and external headwinds, Maybank Investment Bank Bhd (Maybank IB) sees investing opportunities amid current weak sentiment and a capital market that will remain volatile.

In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Axiata said APAC had entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) with Komli Media Inc today, for the proposed acquisition. \\u00a0 On rationale, Axiata said the acquisition is a compelling strategic opportunity for APAC, as it enables the subsidiary to skip past the formative stage of its business plan, and scale up its presence and operations in South East Asian region. \"Komli Asia Group brings with it a geographically diversified revenue and provides a strong strategic fit across digital advertising verticals, such as social, video, display and mobile. \\u00a0 \"It also brings in an experienced and deployed talent base of more than 100 sales, ad-ops and other personnel with strong reputation in the region, with deeply entrenched relationships with premium publishers and advertisers,\" it added. \\u00a0 According to Axiata, Komli was founded in 2006 in India, and is the Asia Pacific's leading digital media technology platform, specialising in digital marketing, performance advertising, social media, brand solutions/advertising, search marketing and video solutions. Komli was a US-incorporated company with its headquarters in Mumbai, India. It has offices across India and Asia Pacific region. It also has operations in the South East Asian markets, such as Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. The operations here are carried out through subsidiary and associates companies held by Komli Asia (Komli Asia Group). Komli Asia is a private limited company incorporated in Singapore, the filing stated. \\u00a0 Axiata said the purchase consideration will be funded through internally-generated funds.

But Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) managing director and CEO Tan Sri Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa probably does not think he has a cosy job. \\u00a0 TM dominates fixed-line telephone services in Malaysia and currently enjoys the lion\\u2019s share of the local high-speed broadband (HSBB) market. However, keeping up with the telecommunications company\\u2019s rivals, including sister company Axiata Group Bhd, is not a 100m dash for Zamzamzairani but a long-distance race. He has to be on a constant lookout for fresh growth drivers and keep fine-tuning the telco\\u2019s business model to maintain its foothold in the industry. This explains why TM advanced from HSBB to mobile broadband services. And as in the past, its bold move to take up a controlling stake in loss-making WiMAX operator Packet One Networks (M) Sdn Bhd (P1) \\u2014 an investment of more than RM1 billion, including capital expenditure \\u2014 came in for a lot of flak. \\u00a0 But already, before seeing any contribution from P1, TM is paying the price of investing in the unprofitable company. In its first quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1QFY2015), net profit plunged 38.8% year on year to RM128.9 million, although revenue grew 6% to RM2.77 billion. The weaker earnings despite higher revenue were mainly due to the consolidation of P1\\u2019s loss of RM49.6 million at Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) level as well as higher operating costs, such as direct and staff expenses. Excluding foreign exchange and one-off gains/losses, TM\\u2019s normalised net profit of RM171.3 million in 1QFY2015 was still below market expectation \\u2014 only 17.8% of consensus\\u2019 full-year forecast. In a knee-jerk reaction to the release of the 1QFY2015 results on May 29, TM\\u2019s shares slid 6.2%.  Now, Zamzamzairani has to talk hard to convince the investing public that buying into P1 was an essential move that will eventually yield returns. \\u00a0 The 55-year-old has been at the helm of the telecoms giant since April 2008 when TM undertook a demerger exercise that separated the group\\u2019s fixed line services from its mobile service operation. Back then, he had to convince his staff and investors that there was hope of survival and growth for the dinosaur \\u2014 which was how TM was perceived at the time \\u2014 without the mobile service operation, which was in an exponential growth phase. Subsequently, Zamzamzairani was tasked with investing in HSBB despite shareholders\\u2019 doubts about the returns from such a massive investment. TM\\u2019s RM8.9 billion investment in HSBB started to bear fruit with UniFi becoming a household brand but the ever-changing telecoms landscape would not let Zamzamzairani rest on his laurels. But he quickly found the missing piece in the puzzle \\u2014 mobile broadband services. Mobile data services are becoming the bread-and-butter business for local mobile operators and are expected to surpass mobile voice revenue in 2017, according to International Data Corp\\u2019s (IDC) Mobile Service Tracker. With its investment in P1, Zamzamzairani believes the telco, which aspires to become a converged service provider within three to five years, now has a complete portfolio of products to deliver converged communication services, including fixed as well as mobile and wireless services. \\u201cIf you look at the big picture, we are already the broadband champion in Malaysia. Our customer base has increased to 2.23 million, led by more than 780,000 UniFi subscribers, and counting. So, what is TM\\u2019s next step? The key is to become a convergence champion,\\u201d he tells The Edge. For TM, convergence means to build and operate a seamless network that is capable of supporting all customers and anytime-anywhere-any device applications, he explains. \\u201cBefore, whether the users were at home or in the office, they were our customers. Today, even when they are outside, they can still be our customers as we have deployed WiFi in many locations, such as shopping malls. \\u201cThe one thing that was missing was when these people were on the move or when they were in places with no access to WiFi. Now that P1 is part of our family, we can provide that mobility piece to complete the picture, so these customers can remain our users wherever they are.\\u201d To recap, in March last year, TM (fundamental: 0.80; valuation: 1.10), Green Packet Bhd (fundamental: 1.10; valuation: 0.30) and South Korea-based SK Telecom Co Ltd (SKT) established a partnership framework to jointly invest in P1. TM\\u2019s initial investment was RM350 million to subscribe for a 57% stake in P1 and RM210 million to pump into Green Packet\\u2019s newly issued medium-term notes (MTN), which may be exchanged for Green Packet\\u2019s stake in P1 at a later date. To date, TM has invested close to RM120 million of the RM210 million MTN. The remaining RM90 million is expected to be used this year. The acquisition of P1 was completed last September with TM controlling 55.3%, Green Packet 31.1% and SKT 13.6%. With regard to funding commitments, the MTN programme provides P1 with the avenue to raise future funds of up to RM1.65 billion in tranches, of which TM is entitled to subscribe for up to RM990 million within three years. The proceeds raised via the programme will be utilised to finance the implementation of P1\\u2019s business plan, which will involve the rollout of a long-term evolution (LTE) network. When TM\\u2019s shares were trading at around RM7.20, PublicInvest Research analyst Lee Wee Sieng, in a June 1 report, warned that the stock had overvalued the potential of its new wireless business, which carried execution risks. Commenting on the impact of P1\\u2019s losses on TM\\u2019s financial performance, Zamzamzairani says the acquisition must be given time to reap rewards for the group. \\u201cWhen you acquire a company, of course, there will be the integration cost, which you will have to bear. This is not a surprise; we knew that was going to happen. \\u201cWhat is more important is how we turn P1 around. The compelling story is that we now will be able to provide converged services, which we couldn\\u2019t before.\\u201d But it has been nine months since the acquisition and the management teams of TM, Green Packet and P1 still cannot say when P1 will become profitable. Most research analysts expect TM\\u2019s earnings to continue to be weighed down by P1\\u2019s losses in the coming quarters, if not the coming years. However, Zamzamzairani says they have their own time frame. \\u201cThere is only so much we can share openly. Just wait and see. We are working hard on integration and we have already put in a strong management team in P1.\\u201d The actual business plan may seem sketchy at the moment but it is learnt that P1 is making a transition from fixed wireless broadband provider to digital mobile telecommunications player providing 4G-LTE services. Although it appears that P1 may fight with the Big 3 \\u2014 Maxis, DiGi and Celcom \\u2014 for market share, Zamzamzairani clarifies that TM is not positioning itself as a mobile operator. \\u201cTM is not going to be the fourth mobile service provider. We will be the No 1 in convergence but that would include us providing pure mobile services through P1,\\u201d he says, adding that with TM\\u2019s backing, P1 has a strong chance of returning to the black. \\u201cThe P1 story is not just a P1 story anymore. It is now a TM story. It is a member of our family.\\u201d Now, investors will be left wondering about the company\\u2019s future dividend payout, considering the huge capital expenditure for P1 and Phase 2 of HSBB in the coming years. While the acquisition of P1 shows that TM is making a comeback to the mobile service sector, it is worth noting that the telecoms industry has evolved over the years \\u2014 the mobile service sector has passed its high-growth phase in terms of penetration. The question now is, how much will TM, a fixed line service operator, eventually benefit from its push into wireless business through P1? It is noteworthy that TM\\u2019s financial performance and dividend payout are constantly in the limelight because it is 28.95%-owned by sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd and 15.07%-owned by the country\\u2019s largest retirement fund, the Employees Provident Fund.

It is learnt that the scheme was offered to its middle management staff. \\u201cThose who took it up are currently serving out the notice,\\u201d says a source. Celcom, a unit of Axiata Group Bhd, said it was not able to comment on the matter at press time. It is unclear whether the scheme is a prelude to a bigger reorganisation programme by the telecommunications company (telco). Be it a bloated workforce or harsher operating environment, Axiata is among the latest to offer a separation scheme to cut costs. Malaysian Employers Federation executive director Datuk Shamsuddin Bardan was quoted by news portal The Malaysian Insider last month as saying that about 20% of its members were looking at such an option. They cut across all economic sectors, from retail and hospitality to manufacturing. He said companies were finding it more difficult to meet overheads because of weaker demand, especially post-Goods and Services Tax. The federation\\u2019s membership comprises about 5,000 companies and 22 trade associations. Two recent high-profile separation schemes were those by Malaysian Airline System Bhd and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. The national carrier, which is laying off 6,000 employees, is probably the first among government-linked corporations to carry out such a massive job cut. CIMB has just completed its mutual separation scheme exercise, which saw a rationalisation of 11.1% of its total workforce in Malaysia and Indonesia. In 2013, Maxis (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 1.10) undertook an exercise, called career transition scheme (CTS). The scheme cost the telco RM143 million, and in its 2013 annual report, it says the CST enabled it to \\u201cbetter align skill sets with business priorities\\u201d. \\u201cThe operating landscape is tough for all businesses, not just telcos. But looking at that sector, the second quarter is expected to be tougher as it still faces GST confusion. We expect things to pick up in the second half of the year,\\u201d says a local telco analyst. On Axiata (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.10), he says it is facing some challenges in upgrading its IT systems, which affected its operations. \\u201cThey are close to resolving that. They have been competitive with their pricing in a bid to regain their momentum. So, we are expecting things to pick up for them. Their margins are still healthy,\\u201d he adds. \\u201cThe stock (Axiata) is trading at EV/Ebitda (enterprise value/earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of eight times, which is relatively low compared with other telco stocks. Malaysian pure-play players like DiGi.Com Bhd (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 1.70) and Maxis are trading at 12 to 13 times. However, it should be noted that Axiata also has foreign telecoms businesses, which could contribute to its lower valuation. It has a dividend yield of between 3% and 3.5%.\\u201d Axiata\\u2019s mobile subsidiaries and associates operate under the Celcom brand name in Malaysia, XL in Indonesia, Dialog in Sri Lanka, Robi in Bangladesh, Smart in Cambodia, Idea in India and M1 in Singapore. Additionally, the group has set up a communications infrastructure solutions and services company called edotco Group. For the financial year ended Dec 31, 2014 (FY2014), Axiata\\u2019s Ebitda dipped 3.7% to RM7 billion while profit after tax and minority interests fell 7.9% to RM2.3 billion due to Celcom\\u2019s weaker performance, XL\\u2019s cost of buying Axis in Indonesia and the weakening rupiah. It paid a total dividend of 22 sen per share in FY2014. It had a cash balance of RM5.1 billion and a gross debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 1.99 times as at end-2014. The group recorded revenue growth of 5.2% to RM4.75 billion in the first quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1Q2015) from a year earlier, on the back of higher revenue contribution from all key companies, notes Axiata, in its results announcement. Operating costs rose 10.4% to RM3 billion in 1Q2015 from a year earlier, due to higher expenses in Malaysia and the impact of Axis\\u2019 consolidation in Indonesia. Net profit dropped 13% year on year to RM584.8 million. The operating landscape has indeed become more challenging, and this is evident in the 1QFY2015 financial results of most corporates.

In addition to costs savings and better specialised services, outsourcing also allows manufacturers or companies to focus on the core operation of their businesses,\\u201d it says. Century Logistics\\u2019 key customers include F&N, Celcom Axiata, LG, Singer and Haier.  Yields above industry average, PER below At its close of 90.5 sen last Thursday, Century Logistics was trading at nine times price-earnings ratio (PER) and had a dividend yield of 5.19%. \\u201cThe stock is undervalued and the company is in a resilient business. It is trading lower than the industry\\u2019s PER of 12 times and higher than the industry\\u2019s average dividend yield of 2.9%,\\u201d says an analyst covering the stock. Century Logistics\\u2019 net asset value stood at 76 sen per share as at March 31. On May 18, Kenanga issued a \\u201ctrading buy\\u201d call on Century Logistics with a fair value of RM1.19, based on 12.5 times FY2016E PER -- a 35% discount from the overall average derived from global logistics companies. \\u201cOn top of that, we are projecting DPS of 5.5 sen and 5.0 sen, respectively, for FY15 and FY16, which translate into a yield of 6.4% and 5.8%,\\u201d says Kenanga. Century Logistics\\u2019 appeal lies in the expectation of solid earnings growth, averaging 19% per annum over the next two years, ability to secure new contracts underpinned by its track record with established clientele and decent dividend yield projections, the research house adds. According to Teow, Century Logistics is trying to achieve its RM500 million turnover target within the next two to three years, and is targeting RM300 million this year. The group, he adds, is also looking at expanding its warehouse capacity to five million sq ft. The group currently manages two million sq ft of warehouse space, 1.5 million sq ft of which it owns. Cash call not needed for current expansion plans In anticipation of rising demand for warehouse space, Century Logistics will invest RM90 million in building a new multilevel facility on an eight-acre parcel at Eastern Gate Way Industrial Hub in Klang. Scheduled to be completed in 2017, the new building will expand the group\\u2019s warehousing space by 450,000 to 600,000 sq ft. Asked if the group plans to make a cash call for the undertaking, Yeap says there is no need for it. \\u201cOur current net gearing is below 0.1 times and we do not expect it to exceed 0.4 times with the borrowings for the new multi-storey warehouse. Our cost of borrowings is below 5% per annum.\\u201d According to Teow, \\u201cWe are in advanced talks to secure a 10-acre piece of land in Pelabuhan Tanjung Pelepas (PTP) in Johor. This is part of plans to expand our capacity. We currently have four facilities in PTP and they are all at full capacity. We expect demand for warehousing to increase and there is also the spillover from Singapore. \\u201cFor this new piece of land, we target it to be purpose-built and we want it to be used for long term contracts \\u2014 five years plus five years.\\u201d The group\\u2019s oil logistics business had suffered a setback due to the termination of operations at Pasir Gudang port in Johor at the end of 2011. However, Century Logistics managed to salvage this business and now has three floating storage units (FSU) in PTP in Johor. The FSUs are used for the\\u00a0 blending, storage and offloading of oil. \\u201cThe drop in oil prices does not affect our business by much as we only offer the service to oil providers; we do not take a position on the oil price,\\u201d says Yeap, adding that another FSU will be coming on stream this year. As for its procurement logistics segment, Teow says Century Logistics had to reinvent itself and keep up with the changing landscape. \\u201cWe shifted from OEM to procurement, assembly and repackaging services. There is potential in this business, [and] we need to work with the right partners for it. For example, we used to assemble television sets for Syria \\u2014 it was a good business model \\u2014 but we had to stop because of the sanctions. We are now studying potential new countries to replicate that model,\\u201d he says. Century Logistics also found a new client \\u2014 global electronics player Philips \\u2014 at the end of last year for the procurement logistics business, Teow says. This helped strengthen the group\\u2019s bottom line in the first quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1Q2015). Century Logistics saw its 1Q2015 net profit rise 25% year-on-year to RM7.8 million. For the financial year ended Dec 31, 2014, its net profit expanded 48% to RM33.3 million. Teow has an 11.8% stake in Century Logistics while his uncle Datuk Phua Sin Mo, who is the group\\u2019s chairman, has 26.7%. Asked if he would consider being bought out, Teow replies: \\u201cEverything has a price, but just to note, I am in this for the long term.\\u201d Note: The Edge Research\\u2019s fundamental score reflects a company\\u2019s profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers.

In a note to investors last Friday, CIMB Research analyst Foong Choong Chen said the research house maintains its \\u201cunderweight\\u201d rating on the telco sector as financial results for the second quarter of 2015 (2Q2015) and 3Q2015 are likely to disappoint the market. \\u201cWe cut our financial year 2015 to 2017 Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) and core EPS (earnings per share) forecasts for DiGi.Com Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd and Maxis Bhd to factor in more intense price competition in the prepaid mobile market, and less benefits from passing through the 6% GST to prepaid users as the regulators have decided to charge GST upon usage (that is subscribers may pare down usage) rather than on top of the usual top-up card prices,\\u201d Foong noted. Putrajaya had on May 13, almost 45 days after the implementation of GST, announced that GST will not be imposed on prepaid reloads but will be based on usage, which would result in lower usage from subscribers. When contacted, an analyst from HLIB Research told The Edge Financial Daily that despite the downside, telcos might be able to see some relief in 3Q2015, during the Hari Raya celebration and the school holidays. Moreover, the 3Q and 4Q are traditionally the better quarters for telcos. AllianceDBS Research analyst Toh Woo Kim concurred, and stressed that there will still be growth in the industry, but at a slower pace. Therefore, he particularly favours Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), which is secluded from the mobile operators\\u2019 competition. \\u201cThe competition now is intense, despite the fact that revenue from mobile Internet is increasing, but revenue from voice and SMS (short messaging services) are declining as well,\\u201d he told The Edge Financial Daily. \\u201cPreviously, the Big Three (Maxis, DiGi and Celcom) would always try to maintain their prices, but now, even they are competing with lower priced products,\\u201d Toh added. Foong also noted that industry mobile Internet revenue rose 3.4% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q), but was more than offset by 5.4% and 14.2% q-o-q decline in voice and SMS respectively. An analyst who declined to be named, pointed out that Maxis (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 1.1) and Celcom Axiata Bhd, a unit under Axiata (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.1), is fighting aggressively for more market share in the migrant workers and rural segment, by offering products with lower international direct dialling (IDD) rates. With the intensified competition in the prepaid market, DiGi (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 1.7) would have been negatively impacted as its prepaid market leadership came under heavy attack from competitors, Foong\\u2019s report noted. DiGi declined by 11% to RM5.51 yesterday, from RM6.22 per share on April 1. Meanwhile, shares of Maxis and TM (fundamental: 0.8; valuation: 1.1) were up by four sen (0.62%) and nine sen (1.32%) respectively to close at RM6.53 and RM6.92 a share. Axiata\\u2019s share price fell one sen or 0.15% to RM6.49 per share.

In its sixth installation, the BRC aims to recognise Malaysia\\u2019s largest corporates for jobs well done \\u2014 not only in raking in profits but also in corporate responsibility (CR) efforts. OCBC has been the main sponsor since BRC\\u2019s inception in 2010. Senior vice-president and corporate and commercial banking head Jeffrey Teoh says awards like the BRC act as an incentive for companies to adopt a holistic approach to doing business. He says that the purpose of business is increasingly recognised as a platform for providing meaningful service to humanity, with profits being the means by which to keep such a meaningful entity viable. \\u201cI think a company exists as part of a whole ecosystem in terms of regulators, shareholders and stakeholders,\\u201d he says. \\u201cSo, if you don\\u2019t have an event to recognise that, it is all for naught, it is not sustainable.\\u201d He says OCBC enjoys being a part of the annual event, not so much as an aid to brand building, but because \\u201cit is the right thing to do\\u201d. \\u201cI think the not-so-obvious elements [in business] such as how you operate in an environment where there is growing awareness of CR, how we function in an economic manner without destroying the environment and how we operate in a manner where we give opportunities for Malaysians to broaden their talent ... these things do not get much coverage, but that\\u2019s why I think the BRC is very different compared with other awards,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt is more holistic. It is a more balanced scorecard.\\u201d Jaeger-LeCoultre Malaysia country manager Reena Tan says BRC\\u2019s high standard of assessment, which is based on quantitative and qualitative criteria, sets the event apart from the others in the business community. \\u201cI think it is important to give recognition to corporations that have done tremendously well all round, not just in terms of profits but also their contributions to the Malaysian society,\\u201d she says. \\u201cAs Jaeger-LeCoultre, too, plays a big role in CR, it has had a strong partnership with Unesco (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) since 2008, to protect the 47 marine areas listed as World Heritage sites.\\u201d She says that the company has even made a short video titled The Guardians on Glacier Bay National Park. The US national park is a hotbed for marine biodiversity, recognising the work of scientists and project managers in preserving the site. The chief executive officer (CEO) of the BRC Company of the Year award winner will receive a Master Eight Days Perpetual 40 watch. The watch has a perpetual calendar and boasts an eight-day power reserve, thanks to its twin barrels that store up a considerable amount of energy.  Technically programmed to require no manual correction before the year 2100 \\u2014 even the noblest mechanisms cannot keep track of the century years that are not leap years \\u2014 it will continue to provide an accurate display of the date, the day of the week, the month and the year in four digits, along with the power reserve, the moon phase, the alternation between night and day, and even the security zone between 10pm and 3am during which no changes must be made. Tan says the watch is a symbol of the values inherent in exemplary leadership and for steering a company to the billion-ringgit mark. \\u201cJaeger-LeCoultre is a visionary brand that celebrates accomplishment in fine watchmaking, combining elegance and confidence,\\u201d she adds. \\u201cHence, our values are, in a way, a fine representation of the corporation/CEO who will be receiving the Jaeger-LeCoultre timepiece.\\u201d The BRC recognises companies with a market capitalisation of RM1 billion and above as at March 31 each year. The shortlisted companies, which are added to the annual list automatically once they fulfil the requirements, are evaluated based on growth in profit before tax, returns to shareholders and CR commitments, among others. The CR initiative component is evaluated by a panel of judges, which includes an OCBC representative. The BRC awards include Malaysia\\u2019s Outstanding CEO, Most Profitable Company, Highest Profit Growth Company and Best Performing Stock. Previous winners of the Malaysia\\u2019s Outstanding CEO award were Public Bank Group chairman Tan Sri Teh Hong Piow, CIMB group chairman Datuk Seri Nazir Razak, AMMB Holdings Bhd chairman Tan Sri Azman Hashim, AirAsia group CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes, former Malayan Banking Bhd president and CEO Datuk Seri Abdul Wahid Omar and former\\u00a0 S P Setia Bhd president and CEO Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin.

The current market uncertainties could also bode well for a defensive sector like telco. The sector\\u2019s aggregate service revenue and the normalised earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margin remain intact for the first quarter of calendar year 2015 (1QCY15) despite total subscribers falling for the first time since 1QCY14. Our correlation study on share prices versus consensus\\u2019 target prices as well as the premium versus discount study on the sector\\u2019s price-earnings ratio versus the FBM KLCI suggested that the sector downside is limited from here. On the corporate front, Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) and DiGi.Com Bhd could have reached or be close to their temporary bottom, while Maxis Bhd and Axiata Group Bhd may have another 2% to 4% downside from here. Competition in the mobile prepaid and post-paid segments appears to be escalating following the recent launch of various aggressive offers by incumbents.

The trend remained bearish below the short- and long-term 30-day and 200-day moving averages. It remained below the Ichimoku Cloud indicator as well. The 30-day moving average fell below the 200-day moving average and the last time this happened was in October 2014 when the KLCI fell to as low as 1,674 points in December 2014. Momentum indicators like the RSI and momentum oscillator started to increase last week, indicating that the bearish momentum has eased. The RSI indicator is at its oversold level and this may attract bargain hunters. The index has rebounded from the bottom bands of the Bollinger Bands indicator, but the bands are still expanding and this indicates that the momentum is still bearish. The technical indicators show that the KLCI is oversold in the short term and technically, a rebound is expected. The outlook for the KLCI remains gloomy and although a rebound is expected, the index may be capped at 1,760 points. Failure to break above this level could send the index to the next support level at 1,675 points. While markets may be bearish, a weaker ringgit may pose opportunities for export-oriented companies such as furniture makers and technology manufacturers.

Looking at the most recent fourth quarter financial year 2014 (4QFY14) result announcement, the group recorded higher revenues compared with the preceding year in the same quarter to RM1.341 billion from RM573.1 million in 4QFY13. Gerbang land sales to FASTrack Iskandar Sdn Bhd of RM248 million and Scope Energy Sdn Bhd of RM522.7 million contributed to the higher revenue. Correspondingly, profit before tax was also higher in 4QFY14 compared with 4QFY13. Looking at the full 12 months financial year 2014 estimate (12MFY14E) compared with 12MFY13E, profit before tax was lower due to lower margins from land sales despite better revenues generated. However, this was mitigated by higher profits from property development. A check on the Bloomberg consensus reveals that 20 research houses cover the stock. Of the 20 reports, there are six \\u201cbuy\\u201d, 12 \\u201chold\\u201d and two \\u201csell\\u201d calls on UEMS. The stock currently trades at a reasonable and low historical price earnings ratio of 11 times. Its price-to-book value ratio of 0.83 times indicates that its share price is trading at a discount to its book value while UEMS has an indicative dividend yield of 2.45%. UEMS\\u2019s chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly timeframes are very firmly down. Its share price made an obvious plunge since its major weekly Wave-2 high of RM3.09 on July 19, 2013. Since that high, UEMS has tumbled to its May 2015 recent low of RM1.16. As prices broke above its recent key critical support levels of RM1.44 and RM1.29, look to sell UEMS on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short-to-longer term down-trend for this stock.\\u00a0 The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD, Oscillator and Stochastic) have issued clear sell signals and now depict firm indications of UEMS\\u2019s eventual plunge towards lower levels. It would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of RM1.16, RM1.29 and RM1.44. We expect UEMS to witness weaker buying at its support areas of RM0.89, RM1.05 and RM1.14. Its downside targets are located at RM0.93, RM0.78 and RM0.44. Lee Cheng Hooi is the regional chartist at Maybank Kim Eng.

The KLCI fell amid domestic political concerns surrounding 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB). At 5pm, the KLCI closed at 1,795.04. Announcement of the 11th Malaysia Plan (11MP) by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak earlier today failed to spark buying interest in the local bourse. The KLCI had earlier dipped to an intra-day low of 1,793.34 points. For comparison, the FTSE Bursa Malaysia Small Cap Index was also down 124.96 points, or 0.75% to close at 16,507.85. An analyst with a local investment bank told theedgemarkets.com that voices in the domestic political backdrop were getting louder, and the market\\u2019s reaction today indicated that investors had started to listen. \\u201cThe market\\u2019s reaction today cannot be due to the 11MP, as there were no surprises and the government had previously hinted on the 11MP\\u2019s proposed plans. \"The fall in the KLCI today is most likely related to the uncertainties involving the political situation in the country,\\u201d said the analyst. Bursa Malaysia saw 2.45 billion shares valued at RM2.29 billion traded. There were 259 gainers against 628 decliners while 284 counters remained unchanged. Top gainers included British American Tobacco (M) Bhd and Microlink Solutions Bhd. Major decliners included Nestle (M) Bhd and Axiata Group Bhd. The most actively-traded stock was Frontken Corp Bhd Despite the KLCI's losses, it is interesting to note that the ringgit strengthened against major currencies. The ringgit changed hands at 3.6018 versus the US dollar and compared to the Singapore dollar, the ringgit was traded at 2.6982. Reuters reported that ringgit was up as the government said it expects dependence on oil-related revenue to decline. Malaysia is a net oil exporter and recent slides in crude have hurt the currency. Across Asian share markets, Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.03% while Hong Kong\\u2019s Hang Seng fell 0.22%. South Korea\\u2019s Kospi was down 0.78%.

Still, Jamaludin admitted that it would be \\u201cchallenging\\u201d to reverse the trend of falling profits seen in the first quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1QFY15). Axiata saw its net profit for 1QFY15 fall 13.3% to RM584.84 million from RM674.88 million in 1QFY14, dragged by losses in its Indonesian operations, lower profit contribution from Celcom, foreign exchange (forex) losses and higher depreciation costs. \\u201cWe have just passed three months (of the financial year) officially. We want to see (results) for this quarter and the next quarter. It is premature to make a forecast for the rest of the year,\\u201d said Jamaludin. He also declined to indicate whether Axiata (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.1) would achieve its initial key performance indicator targets of 4% growth in revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Jamaludin explained that Celcom\\u2019s earnings in 1QFY15 were dragged by \\u201cteething issues\\u201d from the company\\u2019s IT transformation programme last year which led to loss of confidence among distributors and customers in its systems. During the quarter, Celcom, the country\\u2019s second largest mobile operator, lost 688,000 subscribers while its net profit declined by 18% year-on-year to RM378.1 million. \\u201cTo be frank, some dealers lost confidence in us. Regaining that confidence cannot be done overnight. We have to prove that our system has not only recovered, but it is the best. We have dozens of initiatives to regain (confidence) and there are goods signs from them,\\u201d said Jamaludin. XL, which suffered RM215.4 million in losses in 1QFY15 due to forex losses and a shift in strategy from lower value customers to middle-end customers to boost average revenue per user , is also expected to do better in 2HFY15. \\u201cFor the record, (XL registered) a very strong black (profitability) if not for forex and its acquisition of PT Axis Tbk. After spending US$865 million (RM3.13 billion), there would be an impact from a loan perspective which is denominated in US dollars and also the interest on the debt,\\u201d said Jamaludin. About 67.2% of XL\\u2019s loans are denominated in US dollars, but Axiata group chief financial officer Chari TVT said measures are being taken to mitigate future forex losses which include entering into currency swaps and rate swaps. \\u201cWe are also talking to our suppliers and converting some of the US dollar contracts to rupiah.

Jamaludin said Axiata's (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.1) two \"engines of growth\", Celcom Axiata Bhd in Malaysia and XL Axiata, in Indonesia were expected to support the group's earnings recovery in the second half ending Dec 31, 2015 (2HFY15). He said at a press conference after Axiata's annual general meeting here today that improved earnings from Celcom could be expected, as last year's system-related issues, which impacted earnings, had been resolved. Jamaluddin said \"dozens of initiatives\" to win back dealers and distributors' confidence were being carried out, following Celcom's IT transformation last year. On Indonesia, he said the shift in XL's strategy from targeting low-end users to higher value mid-range users in Indonesia, would start to bear fruit. Jamaluddin said XL's earnings would pick up in 2HFY15. This follows XL's losses due to its acquisition of Axis Telekom Indonesia and foreign exchange losses. XL's financials have resulted in lower profit at Axiata. Yesterday (May 19), Axiata announced net profit for 1QFY15 fell to RM584.84 million, from RM674.88 million a year earlier.

Revenue in 1QFY15 however, increased 5.2% to RM4.75 billion, from RM4.51 billion a year ago, driven by strong revenue growth from its business in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. \\u201cThe group\\u2019s data revenue continues to grow exceptionally well, with all operating companies posting great traction in the segment. The quarter also saw the group investing more than RM1 billion in capital expenditure, primarily towards strengthening the data network,\\u201d Axiata (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.1) said in a statement today. On outlook, Axiata warns of a challenging performance for the first half ending June 30, 2015 (1HFY15), on competitive pressures and adverse foreign currency fluctuations. However, Axiata noted it may see improved performance in 2HFY15. Paramount Corp Bhd\\u2019s net profit in the first quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1QFY15) grew 18.5% to RM24.83 million, from RM19.56 million in the previous corresponding quarter, thanks to the higher progressive billing of its property division, which was almost doubled. Its revenue soared 67% to RM165 million, from the RM98.78 million in the year before. Despite the higher earnings, its group CEO Jeffrey Chew said 2015 will be a challenging year, due to many different factors which dampen the public\\u2019s appetite for the property sector. He added that the group\\u2019s strategy moving forward, will be to make the most of opportunities that the property and education division has to provide. Chew sees an upside potential in the property sector, as the government is making home ownership more affordable, and improved connectivity is opening up new areas of growth in Greater Klang Valley. Tune Ins Holdings Bhd\\u2019s net profit fell 14.4% to RM16.5 million in the first quarter ended Mar 31, 2015 (1QFY15), from RM19.2 million a year ago, mainly due to a higher base as a result of a one-off gain on disposal of property of RM4.3 million in 1QFY14. Tune Ins\\u2019 (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 0.35) revenue came in 2.4% lower at RM111.25 million, from RM113.95 million a year earlier.\n\\u00a0\nThe insurance provider told Bursa Malaysia today that the lower revenue was due to a decrease of RM4.2 million in gross earned premiums, net off by an increase of RM1.5 million in investment income from collective investment schemes.\n\\u00a0\nOn prospects ahead, the group said it is \\u201con track\\u201d with its growth strategies across its core businesses of general reinsurance and general insurance. Jobstreet Corp Bhd saw its net profit increased 86% to RM2.40 million or 0.34 sen a share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015, from RM1.29 million or 0.20 sen a share a year ago. The company saw its share of profit from equity accounted associates in 1QFY15, grown by 38.8% year-on-year, mainly driven by its associate in Taiwan whose performance continues to meet expectations. Jobstreet (fundamental: 1.95; valuation: 2.4) attributed the increase to higher other operating income, interest income and share of profit of equity accounted associates, and partially negated by higher operating expenses. According to a filing to Bursa Malaysia, quarterly revenue went up marginally by 4.42% to RM590,000, from RM565,000 last year. Following the disposal of its online job portal business to SEEK Asia in November last year, Jobstreet said the group\\u2019s future prospects will depend on the performance of its associated companies in Taiwan and Malaysia, quoted investments in Hong Kong, and operating activities, including Autoworld, in Malaysia. Ho Hup Construction Co Bhd, which releases a stellar set of quarterly financial result, says it has to be selective in its bidding for infrastructure and construction contracts. The company acknowledges the influx of foreign construction firms have depressed the construction margin. On its earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1QFY15), Ho Hup\\u2019s (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 1.2) net profit jumped 77.6% to RM20.09 million, from RM11.31 million a year ago, on strong performance in its property development division. Quarterly revenue rose 6.7% to RM87.96 million, from RM82.42 million previously. Ho Hup did not declare any dividend for the quarter. PJ Development Holdings Bhd saw its net profit dipped 8.71% to RM18.76 million or 4.14 sen per share in the third financial quarter ended March 31, 2015 (3QFY15), from RM20.55 million or 4.54 sen a year ago, on lower contribution from its hotel and leisure division. Revenue for 3QFY15 rose by a marginal 0.64% to RM229.2 million, from RM227.74 million in 3QFY14, driven by its core construction division. The construction division registered a pre-tax profit of RM5.8 million for 3QFY15, up by 102% from 2.9 million in 3QFY14. For the nine months period (9MFY15), the group's net profit rose 7.5% to RM81.58 million or 18.05 sen per share, from RM75.89 million or 16.75 sen per share a year ago; while revenue rose 1. 8% to RM718.07 million, from RM705.5 million. The group said the construction division is expected to contribute to higher earnings in financial year ending June 30, 2015 (FY15), due to more efficient construction cost management; while the hotel and leisure division is expected to decrease slightly in growth, due to low occupancy rate in the overall hotel industry. However, it said as a result of bank credit tightening, the take up rate of property sales is expected to slow down. Padini Holdings Bhd\\u2019s net profit grew 26% to RM26.59 million or 4.04 sen per share for its third financial quarter ended March 31, 2015 (3QFY15), from RM21.11 million or 3.21 sen per share a year ago. The improved earnings were in tandem with a 30% increase in revenue to RM283.62 million, from RM218.85 million in 3QFY14. Padini declared a fourth interim dividend of 2.5 sen for the year ending June 30, 2015 (FY15), payable on June 22, 2015. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Padini (fundamental: 2.5; valuation: 1.5) attributed the better revenue for 3QFY15 to the longer Chinese New Year shopping season, while an additional seven Brand Outlet Stores and six Padini Concept Stores had also supported its growth. For the nine months period (9MFY15), net profit fell 20% to RM62.05 million, from RM77.25 million a year ago; while revenue rose 13% to RM755.96 million, from RM670.25 million in 9MFY14. Property developer Sunsuria Bhd\\u2019s net profit shrunk 36.4% in the financial quarter ended Mar 31, 2015, to RM1.47 million, from RM2.32 million in the corresponding period last year. Revenue for the quarter was down marginally by 6.5%, from RM22.47 million to RM21.02 million, during the period under review. As a result, the company\\u2019s basic earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter fell to 0.93 sen, from 1.69 sen the previous corresponding quarter. Sunsuria said higher revenue was contributed mainly by the developments of Trivo \\u2014 a commercial shop offices project; and Suria Residence \\u2014 a serviced apartment project, both located in Suria Jelutong. However, it did not reveal the factors that had caused the fall in its net profit. For the cumulative period, net profit stood at RM4.45 million, a 24.8% improvement when compared to RM3.56 million achieved last year. Revenue for the cumulative period was RM77.05 million, doubling the corresponding period last year at RM35.46 million. \\u00a0 Budget airline AirAsia Bhd (fundamental: 0.2; valuation: 0.8) denied a news report that it was in talks to sell a minority stake in its loyalty programme joint venture (JV) to private equity firms. In a statement, AirAsia chief executive officer Aireen Omar said the group is not selling its stake in AirAsia BIG loyalty programme which has over 13 million members, and is growing at a rate of 150,000 new members a month. \"Our AirAsia BIG loyalty programme has tremendous potential for growth \\u2014 leaps and bounds beyond where it is today,\\u201d she said.\n\\u00a0\n\\u201cWith an expanding range of partners and rewards, driven by an enthusiastic and passionate team, we expect AirAsia BIG to grow their membership to over 20 million in four to five years, so no, we are not selling,\\u201d she added. Boustead Plantations Bhd's net profit sank 75.6% to RM7.35 million or 0.46 sen per share in the first quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1QFY15), from RM30.13 million or 2.95 sen a year ago, due to a decline in fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production and low palm oil prices. Revenue for 1QFY15 fell 33.6% to RM131.89 million in 1QFY15, from RM198.57 million in 1QFY14. The group also declared a first interim dividend of 2 sen per share for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2015 (FY15), payable on June 30, 2015. Boustead Plantations' vice chairman Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin said the palm oil industry is impacted by bearish palm product prices and increasing supply of alternative vegetable oils. \\u201cMarket conditions continue to be tough. While the year ahead is expected to be challenging due to various pressures, what is important is that the group remains focused on strengthening operational efficiency,\\u201d he said in the statement. In a separate filing, Boustead Plantations announced it is disposing of three parcels of freehold land in Johor for RM48.99 million cash. The group is selling one piece of land measuring 56.3ha to Seng Hong Quarry Sdn Bhd for RM29.09 million. The other two plots of land measuring a combined 31.97ha are being sold to Bentara Gemilang Industries Sdn Bhd for RM19.9 million. Boustead Plantations said the disposals are expected to realise an estimated gain of RM38 million after taxation, which translates into a gain of approximately 2.4 sen per share for FY15. Star Publications (M) Bhd's net profit jumped 63% to RM26.55 million or 3.60 sen a share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015, against RM16.26 million or 2.20 sen a share a year ago, on higher contribution from its event, exhibition, interior and thematic segment. However, Star Publication\\u2019s (fundamental: 2.5; valuation: 1.4) quarterly revenue went up marginally by barely 3% to RM217.43 million, from RM211.12 million last year. In a filing to the Bursa Malaysia, Star said revenue for the event, exhibition, interior and thematic segment \\u2014 consisting of Cityneon and I.Star Ideas Factory \\u2014 increased to RM38.09 million, from RM30.92 million in 1QFY14, mainly due to higher exhibition and thematic segment revenue recognised by Cityneon in the current quarter under review. Shangri-La Hotels (M) Bhd\\u2019s net profit fell 8.5% to RM25.6 million in the first quarter ended Mar 31, 2015, from RM27.9 million in the previous corresponding quarter. The hotel and resort group\\u2019s revenue declined nearly 12% to RM120.7 million, from RM137.0 million a year earlier. In an announcement to Bursa Malaysia today, Shangri-La said its overall financial results reflected the reduced operating performances across all its hotels and resorts, due to \\u201csignificant\\u201d decreases in occupancy amid a \\u201cweaker business environment\\u201d. The group operates the Shangri-La, Hotel Jen, Rasa Sayang, Golden Sands and Rasa Ria brands in Malaysia. Econpile Holdings Bhd posted a net profit of RM12.5 million for the third financial quarter ended March 31 \\u2014 a 128% jump from RM5.5 million in the previous corresponding quarter. Revenue was also higher as the group reported a 30% increase, from RM87.6 million to RM114.1 million in 3Q15. In a statement today, Econpile's group chief executive officer Raymond Pang attributed the group\\u2019s financial improvement to lower operating expenses and improved efficiency. He added that the outlook for the company looks bright, in view of the government\\u2019s decision to undertake more infrastructure projects such as the MRT 2 and LRT 3. WCT Holdings Bhd, which earlier planned to set up an estimated RM2 billion real estate investment trust (REIT) this year, may postpone the exercise until next year. WCT's (fundamental: 0.6; valuation: 2) deputy managing director Goh Chin Liong said the retail-based REIT was \"unlikely\" to be formed this year (2015), due to cautious market sentiment. \"I don't think it (listing of the REIT) will be this year. Everybody is cautious. We will continue to review it. But Goh maintained that the REIT plan was still intact. He said WCT would wait for its retail malls to attain operational maturity.

FGV (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 1.4) was selected an index constituent in December 2012 at a time when its market capitalisation stood at some RM19 billion. Its market cap is now just RM7.59 billion. In a report last Friday, Maybank IB Research sees FGV exiting as an FBM KLCI constituent as it ranked 41st in terms of market cap, and being replaced by Westports Holdings Bhd which ranked 28th by market cap at RM14.83 billion. The FBM KLCI Index series is reviewed semi-annually by the independent FTSE Bursa Malaysia Index Advisory Committee. According to Maybank IB Research, the list is due for a review, using share prices at market close on May 25, 2015. The constituent changes will be implemented after the market closes on June 19, and will be effective June 22. Among the companies currently on the list are Public Bank Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd and Axiata Group Bhd. RHB Research Institute head of research Alexander Chia is also of the view that FGV will be dropped from the FBM KLCI constituent list next month. He pointed to the five counters on the FBM KLCI reserve list, namely YTL Power International Bhd, Gamuda Bhd, Westports, Hap Seng Consolidated Bhd and IJM Corp Bhd, that will likely take over FGV\\u2019s place. In a report dated April 6, 2015, Kenanga Research also did not rule out the risk of FGV being removed from the FBM KLCI constituent list during the next review should its share price decline further. It noted that FGV\\u2019s share price has performed poorly in the last six months, plummeting 38% since October 2014 compared with the KL Plantation Index which declined 6% in the same period.

PublicInvest Research analyst Lee Wee Sieng said the new system will be positive for key mobile players. \\u201cWhile telcos will incur additional costs to reconfigure their systems and produce new prepaid top-up cards, we believe the benefits from passing through GST on prepaid services will outweigh the additional costs of reconfiguration to collect GST based on usage,\\u201d said Lee in a report yesterday. The research house named DiGi.com Bhd (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 1.7) as the main beneficiary of the move, as its prepaid segment contributes 73% to its revenue \\u2014 the highest among mobile players. Lee also noted that DiGi\\u2019s share price performance has been relatively weak in the past month, partly due to uncertainty about the GST implementation. AmResearch analyst Hafriz Hezry said while the outcome of the move is mostly positive as telcos will be able to pass on GST to consumers, consumer usage is likely to be impacted. \\u201cThis model in itself can impact usage, on top of ultra-price sensitive prepaid users which might simply pare usage given the higher effective cost,\\u201d he said, adding that he has conservatively only factored in a 3% pass through instead of a full 6% in his projections. Hafriz noted that under the new pay-per-use GST system, the chargeable GST amount is taken out of prepaid credits, which essentially means that for a RM10 reload (and assuming full usage), consumers only get RM9.40 of actual credit. AmResearch prefers Axiata Group Bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.1) as its top pick for the sector, as it expects a turnaround in subsidiaries PT XL Axiata\\u2019s and Celcom Axiata Bhd\\u2019s performance in the second half of 2015. Maybank Investment Bank Bhd (Maybank IB) analyst Tan Chi Wei also deems the announcement of the new system as a satisfactory outcome for mobile telcos, but noted that the impact on companies\\u2019 bottom lines is not clear-cut. \\u201cThere are elasticity considerations, and competition remains intense. This means part of the newfound revenue could be returned to customers in the form of lower effective tariffs,\\u201d he said, adding that reload sales could have already been affected in April and May, due to the confusion over the GST treatment. However, on the government\\u2019s call for telcos to lower tariffs, Tan said it should not be an issue, as tariffs will trend down over time due to technological improvements. Maybank IB named Maxis Bhd (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 1.1) and Axiata as its top picks for the sector. On Wednesday, Communications and Multimedia Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Shabery Cheek announced that the GST of 6% for mobile prepaid reloads will be based on usage rather than being charged upon the purchase of reloads. Telcos have been given six months to implement the new system. In a statement yesterday, Communications and Multimedia Consumer Forum of Malaysia (CFM) said implementing the new change is a massive effort which is expected to take more than half a year to complete. \\u201cThe decision to change the basis of charging GST from activation to usage is not as simple as an on/off switch. \\u201cIt involves complex reconfiguration of the telcos\\u2019 backend systems as well as those of over 30,000 third party retailers, resellers and agents such as financial institutions, electronic payment providers, supermarkets, petrol stations and all other sales agents,\\u201d it added.

Quoting sources, CIMB analyst Foong Choong Chen wrote in a note that Multimedia and Communications Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Shabery Cheek was not looking at designating prepaid services under the zero-rated list. Foong said: \"Instead, to maintain prepaid top-up cards at pre-GST prices with the same reload credit upon sale, it is possible that GST is applied only upon usage. This is essentially the same as factoring in GST through a reduction in reload credit.\" \"In this event, telcos may not be able to fully benefit from GST as some prepaid subscribers may choose to stick with the reload credit they have and pare down usage, instead of reloading more frequently,\" he said. According to the Royal Malaysian Customs Department's website, consumers are not charged GST under the zero-rated system. Meanwhile, businesses can claim input tax credit when they buy their supplies. CIMB's Foong said if GST was applied only upon usage of mobile telecommunication prepaid reload services, the research firm would have to cut income and share target price (TP) estimates for service providers. The list comprises DiGi.Com Bhd, Maxis Bhd and Axiata Group Bhd. \"Assuming prepaid usage levels drop by 3%, our financial year 2015 (FY15) to FY17 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) forecast for DiGi.Com Bhd would have to be reduced by 2.2% to 2.8%, for Maxis Bhd by 1.6% to 2.1% and for Axiata Group Bhd by 0.8% to 1.1%,\" said Foong. \"Correspondingly, our target prices would have to be revised downwards to RM6.00 (-3.2%) for DiGi, RM6.70 (-2.9%) for Maxis and RM6.85 (-2.1%) for Axiata Group,\" Foong said. Foong also noted that in the worst case scenario where telecommunication firms have to absorb the 6% GST, CIMB's FY15 to FY17 EBITDA forecast for DiGi (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 1.7) would be reduced by 5.2% to 6.7%. CIMB said it would also reduce Maxis' (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 1.1) EBITDA by 3.5% to 4.5% and Axiata's (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.1) by 2.1% to 2.7%.

For example, a RM10 reload costs RM10.60, with 6% GST added. \\u201cThere has been some confusion in the market as to whether prepaid reloads will be back to pre-GST rates from May 1.

Also, the results of a survey currently being conducted by the communications providers to assess if customers prefer lower reload values on which GST will be charged are not yet available. \\u201c[As such,] it may be premature to make any decision at this point in time,\\u201d Halim added.

The survey is to assess whether customers prefer a RM10 reload to be RM10.60 (RM10 reload plus 6% GST added) or RM10 (RM9.43 reload plus 6% GST added). Halim explained that the difficulty in reverting to the pre-GST arrangements is due to the complexities in reconfiguring the systems, not only on the part of the service providers, but also on third-party agents such as financial institutions, electronic payment providers, supermarkets, petrol stations and all other sales agents totalling some 30,000 parties. \\u201cThe cost of doing this will be significant on the service providers as well as the third-party agents. In addition, new stocks of prepaid cards need to be produced and distributed nationwide. \\u201cAs all the relevant parties had previously agreed to wait until the survey is completed, MCMC would urge that any further decision on this matter be made only after considering the survey results as well as technical and financial implications,\\u201d he added.

Analysts are of the view that telco players would be able to manage the cut in broadband package fees. Furthermore, they said the move is positive in boosting the broadband take-up rate. Communications and Multimedia Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Shabery Cheek said on Wednesday that the basic broadband package prices are expected to drop by between 11% and 57% in a month or two. Yesterday, Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) said it will introduce two new broadband packages at lower prices. For light users, TM is offering 1Mbps with data usage of up to 1GB for RM38 a month \\u2014 excluding the goods and services tax (GST) \\u2014 starting June 16. This is 57% lower than its current offering of RM88 for the same package. \\u201cThe basic broadband packages offered by the operators are already at affordable prices. The further reduction \\u2014 as announced by the government \\u2014 would not have much impact on them,\\u201d an analyst said. \\u201cTheir earnings will only be eroded if the government extends it to cover other broadband packages,\\u201d he added. According to him, basic broadband packages priced at an average of RM60 to RM70 per month in the past have seen their prices decline gradually to only RM30. Despite the significant drop in the price per GB of data, revenues of operators are still on the rise, he noted. It is worth noting that for heavy users, TM (fundamental: 1; valuation: 1.1) said it will lower the price of its UniFi 10Mbps triple-play package by 10% to RM179 a month from RM199, starting July 15. Another analyst told The Edge Financial Daily that users\\u2019 data consumption has increased noticeably since the emergence of smartphones and tablets. He added that most consumers \\u2014 except for those in rural areas or new to the technology \\u2014 would opt for data packages more than 1GB, making the price reduction redundant. At the time of writing, it was unclear whether other telcos will follow TM\\u2019s footsteps by lowering prices of packages targeted at heavy data users. Meanwhile, Kenanga Research telecommunications analyst Cheow Ming Liang said the sector could face some pressure on margins as a result of lower broadband entry prices. \\u201cHowever, the impact is likely to be short-lived \\u2014 given consumers\\u2019 tendencies to upgrade to higher connection speed as well as to subscribe to more value-added and Internet-related services once they have more Internet experience. \\u201cWe believe with these value-for-money offerings, more consumers will be able to get into the digital mainstream and participate in the digital world,\\u201d he said. HLIB Research said the quantum of the data tariff reduction is a negative surprise, especially for fixed broadband. \\u201cWith a lower price barrier, we expect stronger net adds and traffic volume to partly offset the cut in prices,\\u201d HLIB Research analyst Tan J Young said in a note yesterday. \\u201cMoreover, the delayed GST boost coming in June will also cushion the impact,\\u201d he added. According to him, DiGi.Com Bhd (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 2.1) seemed to have the least impact due to small differentials compared with its existing data pricings, followed by Axiata Group Bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.1) and Maxis Bhd (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 1.1).

Among the telecommunication stocks, Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) led the losers. As at 10.26am, its shares fell 6 sen or 0.81% to trade at RM7.34 with 1.38 million shares done, for a market capitalisation of RM27.523 billion. This is followed by DiGi.Com Bhd, which lost 2 sen or 0.32% at RM6.22 with 1.51 million shares changing hands with a market capitalisation of RM48.516 billion. Axiata Group Bhd dropped 2 sen or 0.28% at RM7.02 with 861,300 shares done, for a market capitalisation of RM60.535 billion. Maxis was unchanged at RM7.20 with 397,800 units shares having been traded for a market capitalisation of RM54.055 billion. In a statement yesterday, Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Shabery Cheek said mobile broadband packages will be offered at RM25 per month and consumers who sign up for these will have a monthly data cap of 1GB and at least 3G high-speed packet access for both prepaid and post-paid services. The reduction works out to about 14% less than current prices. As for fixed services, TM will soon be offering a basic broadband package at RM38 a month for 1Mbps of free data usage up to 1GB, which is 57% cheaper than the current RM88 for the basic package. Despite the reduction in broadband prices, Kenanga IB Research reiterated its Neutral call on the sector in a sector note today. According to Kenanga IB's telecommunication analyst Cheow Ming Liang, the sector could face some margin pressures as a result of the lower broadband entry prices. However, he said the impact is likely to be short-lived given consumers' tendencies to upgrade to higher connection speeds as well as subscribe to more valued-added and internet-related services once they have more internet experience. \"We believed with these value-for-money offerings, more consumers will be able to get into the digital mainstream and participate in the digital world,\" he said. Meanwhile, Hong Leong Investment Bank Research said the quantum of the data tariff reduction was a negative surprise, especially for fixed broadband. \"With lower price barrier, we expect stronger net adds and traffic volume to partly offset the cut in prices,\" Hong Leong's analayst Tan J Young said in a sector note today. \"Moreover, the delayed Goods and Services Tax (GST) boost coming in June will also cushion the impact,\" he added. According to him, DiGi.Com (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 2.1) seemed to have the least impact due to small differentials compared to its existing data pricing, followed by Axiata (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.1) and Maxis (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 1.1). As for fixed players, Tan said TM (fundamental:1; valuation:1.1) would be impacted the most as internet is the largest revenue contributor to its retail segment. Hong Leong also has a Neutral call on the sector. Hong Leong's top pick was Axiata with a Buy calls with a target price of RM7.52 on the back of Celcom's recovery after prolonged Information Technology (IT) transformation, full integration of XL-Axis and strong growth of operating company (OpCos) in emerging markets.

In a strategy note today, the research house said it had anticipated aggregate earnings of RM16.42 billion for the 30 constituents It said the 4QCY14 figure was sequentially higher yet lower on-year at plus 5.3% quarter-on-quarter and minus 9.3% year-on-year respectively. \\u201cHowever, the sequential and on-year reported growth figures require some adjustments as they slightly dampened the fair earnings picture. \\u201cThe reported sequential growth number was slightly depressed by RM358.9 million impairment provisions recorded by MISC Bhd in 4QCY14. \\u201cMoreover, the on-year growth number was further weakened by the effect of RM581.4 million gain on disposal of Gumusut-Kakap FPS in 4QCY13, also by MISC,\\u201d it said. MIDF Research said the percentage of companies within its coverage which reported earnings that came below expectations rose further to 36% (highest since second quarter 2013) in 4QCY14 from 31% in the preceding quarter. \\u201cHowever, it is noteworthy that the proportion of positive surprises also increased to 15% (highest since fourth quarter 2011) during the quarter under review vis-\\u00e0-vis 6% recorded in 3QCY14. \\u201cAccordingly, companies with results that were in line with expectations declined to 49% in 4QCY14 from 63% in the prior quarter,\\u201d it said. The research house said that as in prior reporting season, the disappointing earnings streak continued into 4QCY14 with the aggregate numbers coming in plainly below expectations. \\u201cThis is attested by (i) the apparent negative variances between the overall earnings of both MIDFR Universe stocks and FBM KLCI constituents against their earlier estimates prior to the just concluded reporting season, and (ii) the continued rise to 35% in the percentage of earnings underperformers among our coverage universe,\\u201d it said. MIDF Research said that among the FBM KLCI constituents under its coverage, Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd, MISC and Malayan Banking Bhd were the only four companies that reported better than expected earnings. On the contrary, it said there were nine earnings underperformers, namely AMMB Holdings Bhd, Astro Malaysia Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd, IOI Corporation Bhd, Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd and Sime Darby Bhd. Consequently, MIDF Research said the respective aggregate earnings result and estimate for FY2014 and FY2015 of the 23 FBM KLCI stocks under its coverage were lowered by -0.7% and -1.5% to RM52.53 billion and RM53.03 billion respectively vis-\\u00e0-vis their earlier estimates prior to the just concluded reporting season. \\u201cConcomitantly, the respective aggregate earnings result and estimate for FY2014 and FY2015 of stocks under MIDFR Universe were also adjusted lower by -0.6% and -2.8% to RM68.87 billion and RM70.66 billion respectively,\\u201d it said.

However, analysts say it is too late now to jump into telco stocks just because of that. \\u201cIf investors were to jump into buying telco stocks purely from anticipation of higher earnings due to GST implementation, then it is already too late do so now. The GST talk has been around for a long time and any benefit would have been priced in,\\u201d a research analyst with a local investment bank here told The Edge Financial Daily. \\u201cThere is no doubt that telcos are generally defensive stocks with steady dividend yields. [But] at 3% to 4% yield, they are steady but not excellent. Investors can get that with many other sectors,\\u201d he added. In an April 2 note, AllianceDBS Research had \\u201cconservatively assumed a 3% effective increase in prepaid revenue for the mobile players\\u201d as it thinks that usage might be slightly impacted due to price inflation in the economy.\\u00a0 \\u201cThis had previously led to an earnings upgrade of about 2% to 5% for the mobile players in financial year 2015 (FY15) and FY16,\\u201d said AllianceDBS Research. Maybank IB Research\\u2019s analyst Tan Chi Wei, who has an \\u201coverweight\\u201d call on Malaysian telcos, in a note on the same day also assumed that operators would enjoy the equivalent of a 3% pass-through in service taxes in its earnings forecast. Both research houses noted that DiGi.Com Bhd (DiGi) (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 2.10), which has the highest percentage of revenue generated from prepaid subscribers compared to its peers, will benefit the most out of the price increase. However, more importantly, they both noted that the benefit had already been priced in or reflected in DiGi\\u2019s share price.\\u00a0 DiGi has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 4.1%, according to theedgemarkets.com. In contrast, Maxis Bhd\\u2019s 12-month rolling is at 5.57%. Meanwhile, CIMB Research\\u2019s analyst, Foong Choong Chen, who has an \\u201cunderweight\\u201d call on the sector, said in a note, also on April 2, that the risk-reward of telcos is unfavourable due to their current rich valuations and a potentially more intense competition this year. To recap, telcos increased their top-up voucher or reload coupon price by 6% after the GST kicked in on April 1, which caused quite an uproar among consumers, prompting theCustoms Department to announce that it was investigating the telcos for the price increase, saying that prices should have been maintained.\\u00a0 To add to the confusion, Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Ahmad also weighed in on the issue the following day and said there should be no change to the prices of the reload coupons as the 6% GST would merely replace the sales and service tax (SST), which is also at 6%. But the Communications and Multimedia Consumer Forum later affirmed that top-ups for prepaid mobile services are subject to GST.\\u00a0 Telcos also clarified that they had previously absorbed the SST on prepaid mobile users. On Friday, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission issued a press statement confirming that GST will be imposed on prepaid reloads. However, to ease the burden on consumers and as a transitional measure, it said four major telcos, namely Celcom Axiata Bhd, DiGi, Maxis (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 0.9) and UMobile Sdn Bhd customers who reload RM5 and above will be given an additional value which is higher than the 6% GST in the form of free minutes and text messages for three months from April 3. A research analyst with a local bank said that the compromise is \\u201cgood news\\u201d to telcos as the status quo of higher prices would likely stay at the end of three months. \\u201cThe solution is temporary and helps customers with the transition to higher costs. At the same time, mobile operators will still have the opportunity to pass on the cost of taxes to end users. \\u201cPlus, the additional 6% air time that they give to users may not may not be used by the customers. I think consumption patterns would be largely the same,\\u201d he said. DiGi closed unchanged at RM6.33 last Friday, with a market capitalisation of RM49.22 billion.

Stocks fell on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 set to post its third straight negative week. The index is about 3 percent below its record high set this month. Energy stocks were among the biggest losers, falling along with a steep decline in crude oil, according to Reuters. Affin IB vice president and head of retail research Datuk Dr Nazri Khan said he expects the FBM KLCI to stabilise at 1780 support level and build an upleg higher, tracking strong showing of Wall Street and Asian regional indices. Nazri, who is also the president of the Malaysian Association of Technical Analysts, said that on the technical front, following a week and a half of steep declines (the FBM KLCI corrected 49 points or 2.7%), the local stock index was now poised for a rebound at 1780 level. He said the FBM KLCI saw a gap lower last Wednesday but it had since showed positive reversal action at 50-day moving average in late week session.\n\\u00a0 Naari said the FBM KLCI\\u2019s major driver came from a rally in technology, exporters and small cap shares (FBMAce & FBMFledgling) following a setback in the US dollar after eclipsing the 100 level overnight and ringgit depreciation to 3.6900 (down 1.5% w-o-w). \\u201cBursa upside is led by gains in the heavyweight shares of CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, MISC Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd following the latest foreign inflow and domestic fund accumulation. \\u201cFBM KLCI Futures also appear to be stabilizing recent weakness at 1780 level with rising volume and looks poised for a corrective bounce in next week session,\\u201d he said. Nazri said the daily stochastic indicator has already started to turn flattish on its oversold region, while the RSI indicator had also started to ease after trending down south recently. He said these imply that the Bursa benchmark could potentially start to stabilise after its recent correction before seeking a reversal play from there. \\u201cWe see positive broad market breadth with 5 gainers as compared to 3 losers while average daily trading volume increased to 2.9 billion shares worth RM2.1 billion as compared to last week 2.4 billion shares worth RM2 billion. \\u201cActively traded stocks are mostly small cap stocks which include\\u00a0Eti Tech Corporation Bhd, Genetec Technology Bhd, Wintoni Group Bhd, Ingenuty Solutions Bhd, Xinghe Holdings Bhd, United U-Li Corporation Bhd, Nova MSC Bhd, Privasia Technology Bhd, Lee Swee Kiat Group Bhd And Hiap Huat Holdings Bhd. \\u201cThe\\u00a0market medium-term trend remain positive as FBMKLCI close above the 50-day moving average. The next upside area of resistance are pegged around 1800 and 1830 levels while major support hits today at 1780 and 1750 levels respectively,\\u201d he said. Nazri said that on the stock front, he believed there were ample picks following the recent correction. \\u201cGiven the cautiously optimistic 2H2015 sentiment, we prefer blue chips that possess momentum capacity to rebound on event play after the recent sell-off. \\u201cAggressive investors should long index futures while conservative investors should buy our Featured Stocks namely Gamuda Bhd, MISC Bhd, IJM Corporation Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd, KPJ Healthcare Bhd, QL Resources Bhd, Inari Amertron Bhd, Unisem (M) Bhd, Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd, MYEG Services Bhd, Tecnic Group Bhd, Poh Huat Resources Holdings Bhd, SCGM Bhd, Yee Lee Corporation Bhd and Ulicorp,\\u201d he said."}, "387": {"date_posted": "12/3/2015", "title": "Data monetisation still a challenge for telcos", "article": " DATA service, a key earnings growth driver, does not seem to be yielding fat margins for the telecommunications companies (telcos), say analysts who track the industry. Even as the financials of telcos continue to reflect the growing importance of data as a revenue generator, analysts believe the contribution of data service to the bottom line may not be as lucrative, despite higher data adoption rates and wider smartphone usage. According to TA Securities, the main challenges faced by telcos are data pricing and critical mass of data users, leading to compression in data yields measured as price per gigabyte (RM/GB). Data yields have declined and analysts expect this to persist despite the data boom and higher smartphone penetration, the research house says. In her latest report, TA\\u2019s research analyst Kylie Chan says, \\u201cWe understand from operators that margins for small screen mobile Internet (MI) are attractive, almost matching those of voice services. However, we believe that unless operators achieve a critical volume of MI traffic or increase data pricing, Ebitda margin decline will continue to persist.\\u201d The research house notes that DiGi.Com Bhd\\u2019s (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 2.1) data yield has been declining steadily, from RM41 per GB in the third quarter of FY2013 to RM30.50 per GB in the same quarter of FY2014. In the same period, Celcom Bhd\\u2019s data yield was also on a downward trend, albeit less steep than DiGi\\u2019s, falling from RM15.40 per GB to RM13.90 per GB. Maxis Bhd was not included in TA\\u2019s analysis. Responding to queries from The Edge via email, DiGi says its data yields generally decrease over time, given better efficiencies gained from newer network technologies and the growing scale of operators. But the telco believes Internet adoption and usage will increase as data yield optimises over time, given that pricing adjustments allow more affordable data packages and plans. Maxis and Celcom did not reply to The Edge\\u2019s queries. TA\\u2019s Chan believes telcos are hesitant to raise data pricing aggressively due to concerns about losing subscribers. According to a research analyst, if data prices are raised, prepaid consumers who are more price-sensitive may switch to a rival telco, particularly in the foreign migrant and urban youth sub-segment. \\u201cPenetrating this segment and offering affordable Internet plans is key to capturing the growth prospects of data,\\u201d she says, adding that the segment comprises 80% of the market. Telcos, she points out, are \\u201cdesperate\\u201d for incremental market share in the prepaid segment, given its potential, the tepid overall industry growth and the cannibalisation of voice and SMS by data. The research analyst recalls this having happened to Axiata\\u2019s (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 0.90) Indonesian subsidiary PT XL Axiata, which suffered from subscriber attrition after raising prices in 2013. \\u201cIn addition, if prices are high, this segment would most likely refrain from discretionary spending on data,\\u201d she says. On the critical mass of mobile data users, Chan says smartphone penetration is still moderate in Malaysia, at about 50% despite recording growth. The penetration rate is expected to rise to 67% by the end of this year, according to International Data Corp. \\u201cThere is room for growth,\\u201d its research manager Alfie Amir tells The Edge. Alfie concurs that with the increasing number of devices (smartphones and tablets) per person, there is even more room for growth as the tablet market is still expanding. Even so, says the research analyst, critical mass is a \\u201cmoving target\\u201d that takes into account continued network investments and data pricing. \\u201cThe current environment suggests that penetration levels closer to 100% will likely push telcos closer to achieving a critical mass of subscribers.\\u201d She believes affordable smartphone bundles, bite-sized Internet packages and data plans offered by telcos now will eventually help them gain critical mass. In fact, Maxis (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 0.90) recently hiked the prices of its SurfMore M1 plans in an effort to squeeze more money out of data, she notes. An analyst with a bank-backed research house believes mobile operators could improve their data value propositions, but says data yields could take \\u201csome time\\u201d to achieve optimal monetisation. \\u201cMobile operators are experimenting with various pricing models to cater for the different needs of data subscribers. We expect data yields to improve over time, but that would depend on market dynamics.\\u201d  Note: The Edge Research's fundamental score reflects a company\\u2019s profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers.

I was expecting the market to continue to be bullish last week but have also mentioned that the index needs to break above 1,830 points and that crude oil prices must rebound and the ringgit does not turn weak. The FBMKLCI declined 1.8% in a week to 1,789.73 points and was in line with global market performances. Market volume was slightly higher from the previous week. Average daily trading volume was 2.2 billion shares in the past week compared with 2.1 billion shares two weeks ago. After some accumulation two weeks ago, foreign institutions turned large sellers in the past week as the ringgit weakened. Net selling from foreign institutions last Monday to Friday was RM593.5 million while net buying from local institutions and local retail was RM544.0 million and RM49.5 million respectively. For the FBMKLCI, only two out of the 30 counters went up and the increase was marginal. The two counters that went up were CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (+0.2% from last week) and Axiata Group Bhd (+0.1%). The top three decliners in the index were Sapurakencana Petroleum Bhd (-7.7%), Genting Bhd (-7.2%) and Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd (-5.5%). Markets pulled back for a bullish trend correction last week. The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 0.7% in a week to 3,287.10 points. Hong Kong\\u2019s Hang Seng Index fell 3.3% to 23,896.98 points. Japan\\u2019s Nikkei 225 declined 0.8% to 18,665.11 points, the highest level in nearly 15 years. Singapore\\u2019s Straits Times declined 0.7% to 3,398.26 points. On Monday, the US Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.6% in a week to 17,995.72 points after climbing to a record high a week ago. London\\u2019s FTSE100 index declined 0.8% to 6,879.12 points after pulling back from its record high last Thursday. However, Germany\\u2019s DAX Index continued to climb to record highs, climbing 1.5% in a week to a record close at 11,582.11 points. The US dollar index rose to its highest level since September 2004, increasing from 95.34 points a week ago to 98.18 points. The ringgit weakened against the greenback at RM3.71 to a US dollar compared with 3.63 a week ago. The strong US dollar continued to pressure gold prices. COMEX gold fell 3.2% in a week to US$1,166.40 (RM4,304) an ounce. Crude oil remained firm and the Brent crude declined 1.7% to US$58.53 per barrel. Crude palm oil futures on Bursa Malaysia fell 5.9% in a week to RM2,238 per tonne on weak demand. The FBMKLCI has turned bearish as it fell below its short-term 30-day moving average. Market confidence was already weak as the index struggled to break above the long-term 200-day moving average last week and the decline below the short term average indicates sentiment has turned bearish. However, the index remained above the widening Ichimoku Could indicator and this indicates that there is support. Furthermore, the FBMKLCI is still above the immediate support level at 1,780 points. A breakout below this level would confirm the bearish trend. Momentum indicators like the RSI, Momentum Oscillator and MACD are indicating that the price has turned bearish. The RSI and Momentum Oscillator fell below their mid-levels and the MACD crossed below its moving average. Furthermore, the Bollinger Bands are expanding and the FBMKLCI is trading below the bottom band for the past two days. This indicates that the bearish momentum is gaining strength. Technically, the market is expected to remain bearish as the bearish momentum has built up in the past one week. Furthermore, the ringgit is expected to weaken further while crude oil price remains bearish as falling gold prices indicate a possible stronger US dollar. Henceforth, we expect further downward decline and the FBMKLCI is expected to test the immediate support level at 1,780 points. From the indicators, there is a high chance that this level will be broken and the next support level can only be found at 1,680 points.

Analysts are, however, more optimistic about the outlook for corporate earnings growth this year. Most are projecting high-end single-digit growth for 2015, with the more confident forecasting double-digit growth. \\u00a0 This may lift investor confidence somewhat, considering that the latest financial reporting season may not have lived up to expectations. Many had been keeping a close watch on the fourth-quarter results, which concluded last week, as a gauge of how companies would fare amid what was seen as a tougher economic and operating environment. Interestingly though, official data showed that gross domestic product growth had actually improved to 5.8% in the final quarter of 2014, compared with 5.6% in the third quarter. Prices of commodities declined last year, most notably crude oil prices. Crude oil lost nearly half its value to US$60 to US$70 per barrel \\u2014 at its lowest, it was just under US$60, in the fourth quarter \\u2014 from a high of above US$100 in June. Similarly, crude palm oil (CPO) prices also dropped to RM2,100 to RM2,200 per tonne due in part to extensive floods in the East Coast. The plunge in crude oil prices had sent the benchmark FBM KLCI, which shed 5.66% last year, crashing to a low of 1,673.94 on Dec 16 as oil and gas stocks took a beating. The index closed at 1,820.87 points last Thursday. To aggravate matters further, the ringgit has weakened to around 3.50 to the US dollar as the greenback reflected broader strength against most emerging-market currencies on signs of an improving US economy. BIMB Securities head of research Kenny Yee expects corporate earnings this year to grow 8% to 9% after a likely contraction of 0.6% last year, while UOB Kay Hian head of research Vincent Khoo anticipates 10% to 11% earnings growth this year after a probable expansion of between 2% and 3% last year. \\u201cFor 1Q2015 and the rest of 2015, fluctuations in commodity prices, the US dollar/ringgit rate and, to a smaller extent, the temporary cut in electricity tariffs will have a bearing on earnings outlook. While we anticipate some earnings downside to our aggregate earnings growth of around 10% to 11% in 2015 (at the start of the year), we still expect better growth compared with 2014\\u2019s depressed level,\\u201d Khoo tells The Edge via email. Yee, meanwhile, expects the equities market to perform better than last year. From the FBM KLCI perspective, core earnings of index-linked stocks are expected to grow 8.8%, says an analyst from Maybank Investment Bank Research. JF Apex Securities head of research Lee Chung Cheng, however, expects a lower earnings growth of 5% to 6% this year. Analysts say earnings growth this year will be largely underpinned by the banking, telecommunications (telecoms), export and utility sectors. The banking industry will be a key sector, given the reasonable analyst consensus forecast of bank earnings, says Yee. He believes that since the sector has the highest weightage in the broad market and the FBM KLCI, it will drive earnings growth this year. Nevertheless, the Maybank IB analyst cautions that the banking sector may face pressure on margins due to intense competition and a weaker outlook. On the telecoms sector, he says it is a \\u201csteady market\\u201d, given the solid balance sheets of the players. \\u201cTheir ability to come up with package deals should see earnings growth, especially from the data segment, provided margins remain intact.\\u201d He adds that the ability to pass on the cost of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) to the end consumer is a positive factor for telecoms players. \\u201cThe telecoms sector is a beneficiary of the GST. We expect it to report double-digit earnings growth.\\u201d UOB Kay Hian\\u2019s Khoo says the ringgit\\u2019s weakness against the US dollar will continue to benefit exporters, particularly electrical and electronic (E&E), glove-making and flexible plastic packaging companies. He cites Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd (fundamental: 2.1; valuation: 0.3) and Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd (fundamental: 2.3; valuation: 2.1) as \\u201ccurrency winners\\u201d. Etiqa Insurance & Takaful head of research Chris Eng believes E&E firms could be a \\u201cpositive surprise\\u201d. \\u201cThese companies are beneficiaries of the strong greenback and higher demand for white goods (heavy consumer durables such as refrigerators and air conditioners),\\u201d he tells The Edge over the telephone. Despite the electricity tariff reduction announced early last month, analysts continue to favour the utility sector, particularly Tenaga Nasional Bhd (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.8). The government has announced a 5.8% or 2.25 sen per kWh electricity tariff reduction for Peninsular Malaysia. This will come into effect between March 1 and June 30. Tariffs in Sabah will also be reduced by 3.5% or 1.2 sen per kWh in the same period. Eng says Tenaga is likely to perform well despite the temporary rebate. He adds that it will be netted off against the reversals from the \\u201cover-recovery\\u201d of Tenaga\\u2019s fuel costs. \\u201cTenaga still has a strong core net profit. So, it is not an issue.\\u201d Over the long term, Yee says Tenaga will benefit from lower fuel costs and capacity expansion in excess of 1,000mw. \\u201cRevision in tariff is only a short-term knee-jerk reaction, as we believe in the longer run.\\u201d On the whole, RHB Research Institute head of research Alexander Chia says companies with expanded capacity will be instrumental in bringing about earnings growth.\n\\u201cCapital expenditure investment in new capacity is largely completed, therefore, new facilities are beginning to contribute new revenue,\\u201d he says, citing examples of Hartalega Holdings Bhd (fundamental: 2.6; valuation: 0.3), Hovid Bhd (fundamental: 2.1; valuation: 0.3) and Cahya Mata Sarawak Bhd (fundamental: 3.0; valuation: 1.5). Sectors that may underperform this year include plantation and property. These two sectors could see some downside risks due to the lack of growth drivers, says Chia. BIMB\\u2019s Yee says the less efficient plantation companies are most likely to find it tough, given market pressure capping CPO prices. \\u201cSo long as CPO prices remain at current levels, maintaining margins is of utmost importance.\\u201d He says developers offering properties in \\u201cless alluring\\u201d locations may suffer from selective demand, given that loans are more restrictive now. UOB Kay Hian\\u2019s Khoo notes that there could be pockets of mild downside risk this year for some companies due to situational triggers. \\u201cUMW Holdings Bhd (fundamental: 2.2; valuation: 1.2) could be a loser of a weaker ringgit due to US dollar-denominated costs in its automotive division, and Axiata Group Bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 0.9) for poor underlying performance at its Indonesian telecoms business and foreign exchange losses. Genting Malaysia Bhd (fundamental: 2.4; valuation: 0.6) would incorporate one-off costs related to its failed New York casino bid.\\u201d He notes that CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (fundamental: 1.35; valuation: 2.1) is also a potential loser amid a likely spike in credit costs, moderating loans growth, funding cost pressures and continued weakness in investment banking deal flows. The oil and gas sector, which has been snagging headlines since the second half of last year, will continue to be in the spotlight this year as the market will diligently track crude oil prices, Chia opines. \\u201cMuch depends on where oil prices are heading \\u2014 if they make a reversal and go down again, the market will head downwards as a result,\\u201d he says. Lower crude oil prices will translate into lower revenue for oil and gas firms, and consequently see margins shrink.

IOI Properties Group Bhd (IOIPG) has decided to terminate its RM2.74 billion share sale agreement (SSA) entered into on Dec 5, 2014 to purchase a 37.17% stake in Taipei Financial Center Corporation (TFCC). TFCC is a Taiwanese company notable for its ownership of the Taipei 101 skyscraper. IOIPG (fundamental:1.35; valuation: 1.80) said the three month period for the seller and purchaser to obtain the foreign investment approval from Taiwanese authorities had expired on March 5, 2015. Following that, IOIPG decided not to extend the 3-month period of the SSA. In accordance with the SSA, IOIPG will now proceed to obtain a refund of the deposits paid. Genting Plantations Bhd (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 1.5) has tied up with Musim Mas Group to set up a RM300 million palm oil refinery in Sabah. It will have a capacity of 600,000 tonnes per annum or 1,800 tonnes per day and is targeted for completion in the second half of 2016. Both companies had signed an agreement to set up Alfa Raya Development Sdn Bhd to helm the project; Genting Plantations will hold a 72% stake in the entity, while Musim Mas Group will have the remaining 28%. The refinery will be part of the Genting Integrated Biorefinery Complex that the company is establishing for the production of high value-added downstream products. With the complex, Genting Plantations aims to create high-performance palm oil derivatives, using green and efficient processes, at significantly lower production costs and capital investments than conventional petroleum-based processes. Musim Mas Group is among the biggest players in the vegetable oil refining and soap manufacturing industries in Indonesia, and owns the largest palm oil refinery in the world. Axiata Group Bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 0.9)\\u2019s subsidiaries Celcom Axiata Bhd and Celcom Resources Bhd (formerly known as Technology Industries Bhd) had reached a settlement with former TRI executive director Datuk Lim Kheng Yew over three legal suits brought on by TRI against Lim and former chiefs of TRI, Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli and Datuk Bistaman Ramli. The amount of settlement agreed between the parties was not disclosed. However, Celcom and Celcom Resources had filed their respective notices of discontinuance of suits against Lim in the Kuala Lumpur High Court, with no order of costs. TRI had instituted a suit against the three and several others in September 2006, to recover sums paid by the company to them as alleged compensation for the loss of office and incentive payments. The three individuals left TRI\\u2019s board in July 2002, following a bitter power tussle with Telekom Malaysia Bhd, after the latter bought a 31.25% stake in TRI. In March 2013, the Kuala Lumpur High Court had ruled that Axiata Group was allowed to recoup a total of RM37.87 million from Lim, Tajuddin and Bistamam, as restitution of compensation payments made to them. The decision had included interest to be paid at an annual rate of 3% from the judgement date to the date of payment realisation, but without other costs to be assessed.

Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) has extended the service tenure of its president and chief executive officer Datuk Seri Azman Mohd by another three years, from July 1 this year to June 30, 2018. The electricity utility company, who has offered to take over the remaining 77% stakes it does not own in Integrax Bhd (fundamental: 1.65; valuation: 1.2), is also standing firm by its revised offer of RM3.25 a share, expressing optimism that its offer, this time, will be \"well-received\" by the shareholders of the port operator. TNB (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.8) is now awaiting Perak Corp's shareholders to accept the offer at its upcoming extraordinary general meeting on March 27. Perak Corp holds a 15.74% stake in Integrax, via its wholly-owned unit Taipan Merit Sdn Bhd. TNB had raised its offer price for the rest of Integrax to RM3.25 per share on Feb 25, 2015, from the original RM2.75. Integrax shareholders have until March 31, 2015, to decide on the revised offer. Boustead Holdings Bhd (fundamental: 0.65, valuation: 1.8) is acquiring stake in the controversial automated enforcement system (AES), via a proposed shares subscription of 50% stake in Irat Properties Sdn Bhd (Irat) for RM127.8 million. Irat is in the midst of acquiring 100% interest in AES operators A.T.E.S. Sdn Bhd (ATES) and Beta Tegap Sdn Bhd (Beta Tegap).

Boustead\\u2019s proposed acquisition in Irat, which is expected to be completed by second quarter of this year, is part of the group's strategic thrust to strengthen their property division and improve earnings potential. Upon completion, the remaining equity in Irat Properties will continue to be held by Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera (LTAT) and Irat Holdings Sdn Bhd, while the AES will be jointly managed by Boustead and LTAT. The acquisition will also see Boustead acquiring two properties in the city centre, namely the Chulan Tower Office Block and The Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur Hotel, collectively valued at RM508 million. Mulpha Land Bhd has received a mandatory take-over offer from entrepreneur Datuk Fakhri Yassin Mahiaddin, via his private investment vehicle Teladan Kuasa Sdn Bhd, to acquire the rest of Mulpha Land for 49.7 sen a share. The take-over offer was triggered after Teladan Kuasa exercised a call option to acquire 75 million option shares, representing up to 32.85% equity interest in Mulpha Land, at 47 sen apiece or RM35.25 million. \"The board will be meeting to consider the offer, including as to whether the board will be seeking an alternative person to make a take-over offer for the offer shares, and make an announcement in due course,\" said Mulpha Land (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 2.4) in a filing with Bursa Malaysia today.

For the financial year ending Dec 31, 2015 (FY15), TM (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 0.9) is now targeting growth in revenue and earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) of between 4% and 4.5%, compared with an earlier forecast of 6% and 8% respectively set in February 2013. This growth will be largely supported by TM\\u2019s Internet business as demand for the service continues to grow, said its group chief executive officer Tan Sri Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa. For the medium term or by FY17, TM wants to achieve a 5% to 5.5% growth in both revenue and Ebit. Zamzamzairani said these targets do not take into consideration contribution from its 55.3% associate and WiMAX wireless provider, Packet One Networks (M) Sdn Bhd (P1), which TM acquired in March last year. The targets also exclude the implementation of both the high-speed broadband phase 2 (HSBB2) and sub-urban broadband projects which the government awarded to TM this week. \\u201cWhat we are saying [with these KPIs] here is that we would like to see our Ebit growth match our revenue growth. We have to manage our cost to make sure our bottom line matches our top line,\\u201d said he told a news conference to announce the group\\u2019s FY14 results yesterday. A comparison with the headline KPIs for FY14 also showed TM taking a more cautious stance on its forecasts for FY15. In FY14, TM aimed for a revenue growth of between 5% and 5.5%, which it achieved. It also aimed and reached its Ebit growth of 5% last year. The more \\u201crealistic\\u201d targets, Zamzamzairani said, is a reflection of the \\u201cchallenging\\u201d FY15 and a result of balancing efforts to increase earnings while expanding TM\\u2019s business. \\u201cThere are many factors which affect our KPIs. We are fixing the here and now business and, therefore, driving demand for UniFi, increasing average revenue per user by upselling and reducing churn. That\\u2019s the here and now.\\u201d \\u201cAt the same time, we also have to invest our business for future growth. As we do that, our capital expenditure (capex) will increase. The challenge is in finding the balance \\u2026 and it is from that kind of analysis that we came up with our KPIs,\\u201d he said. As for capex for FY15, TM has set aside 20% of its anticipated revenue for enhancing its core network, access and support systems. TM is also cautious that competition among key market players would squeeze its profit margins this year but has said that it is well positioned to handle rivals. \\u201cCompetition has always been there. If anything, it will start heating up. If you look at the way the industry is growing, users are all moving into data. You see voice declining and it is a global phenomenon. Data and Internet are increasing. But we are well positioned in terms of the broadband business.\\u201d \\u201cWith P1 in the group, we have an additional element of mobility. This will enable us in the long run to provide converged services to our customers,\\u201d said Zamzamzairani. Meanwhile, TM saw its net profit fall 17.8% to RM831.81 million in FY14 from RM1.01 billion in FY13 due to the absence of HSBB tax incentives. This came on the back of a 5.7% increase in revenue to RM11.24 billion from RM10.63 billion in FY13. Earnings per share were lower at 22.89 sen compared with 28.29 sen. For the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2014 (4QFY14), net profit also dropped 36.6% to RM218.27 million from RM344.24 million a year ago, due to tax reasons. Revenue, however, was higher by 6% for the quarter under review at RM3.16 billion against RM2.98 billion in 4QFY13. TM also declared a final dividend of 13.4 sen per share, bringing the total dividend payout for the year to 22.9 sen or RM846.8 million. TM\\u2019s share price closed up 12 sen at RM7.10 yesterday, bringing a market capitalisation of RM25.96 billion.

So if you aggregate that, it would be harder for us to grow better than last year,\\u201d he said. Jamaludin said that this year, voice is expected to experience single-digit negative growth and SMS to see a double-digit negative growth. However, data is expected to post a positive increase of between 30% and 50% year-on-year. On capital expenditure (capex), Axiata has allocated RM4.8 billion for the current financial year ending Dec 31, 2015 (FY15) \\u2014 one of the highest amounts the group has set aside. For FY14, Axiata\\u2019s capex was RM4.1 billion. Jamaludin said Axiata (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 0.9) is being aggressive with its capex this year by allocating the full amount to data or data-related investments. \\u201cThis will predominantly be for the setting up of more base stations, fibre optics, and upgrading our core network in most countries,\\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Axiata reported a 3% rise in fourth quarter FY14 (4QFY14) net profit to RM594.93 million from RM575.63 million a year ago, as it posted higher revenue from most of its global operating units. Significantly higher foreign exchange (forex) gains and lower finance cost also supported its profit growth. Revenue for 4QFY14 came in 6.7% higher at RM4.81 billion versus RM4.51 billion in 4QFY13. During 4QFY14, Axiata registered forex gains of RM99.56 million compared with RM8.13 million in 4QFY13, while finance cost fell to RM256.95 million from RM310.23 million. Axiata also declared an interim dividend of 14 sen a share, bringing full-year dividends to 22 sen. For the 12 months period ended Dec 31, 2014, Axiata\\u2019s net profit declined 7.9% to RM2.35 billion from RM2.55 billion a year earlier, but revenue was 1.9% higher at RM18.71 billion versus RM18.37 billion. \\u201cIn FY15, the group will continue to face challenges and remain cautious in executing its business strategies. The key risks facing operating companies include political risks, intense competition, and foreign currency fluctuations and regulatory challenges,\\u201d said Axiata in a filing with Bursa Malaysia yesterday. On whether the group plans to increase its dividend payout ratio, Jamaludin said the current payout of 84% seems to be the right balance between capex reinvestment and meeting the needs of the government as a government-linked company. \\u201cIt is, however, our policy to progressively increase the dividend payout, not necessarily the dividend,\\u201d he said. Meanwhile, on the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission asking service providers to lower service charges, Jamaludin said he was supportive of the measure as it would help the industry in the long run.

IDC Market Research (M) Sdn Bhd research manager Alfie Amir told The Edge Financial Daily that the expected decline in voice revenue for mobile telco players such as Maxis Bhd (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 0.9), Axiata Group Bhd\\u2019s (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 0.9) unit Celcom Axiata Bhd, DiGi.com Bhd (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 2.1) and U Mobile Sdn Bhd will be driven by over-the-top players and long-term evolution adoption. \\u201cIf you look at five years ago, before smartphones were mainstream, voice revenue accounted for about 80% to 90% of total revenue, while data only accounted for 10%. \\u201cAfter the smartphone era, the mobile telcos saw their voice revenue growing at a diminishing rate. We are predicting that this year, in 2015, voice revenue will start to decline for the first time ever,\\u201d he said, noting that mobile voice revenue posted a very slow growth of 2% in 2014. As at 2014, Alfie said voice and data accounted for 58% and 42% respectively of mobile players\\u2019 revenues. Based on the latest figures, he expects revenue contribution from data to surpass voice revenue by 2017. Meanwhile, with the exponentially increasing demand for data, which in turn drives up costs, coupled with the overall slowdown in profit growth due to the saturated mobile market, profit margins of mobile companies are also diminishing. He said that mobile players should look at new revenue streams, as he said that there is not much room for telcos to grow their subscriber base due to the saturated market. \\u201cWhat they can do, however, is to increase their ARPU (average revenue per user), by converting their non-data users to data users, or through offering other services. \\u201cAt the same time, retaining their data subscribers is also important, as there is a lot of churning in a saturated market,\\u201d Alfie said, adding that companies are now focusing on providing the best customer experience, in a bid to retain their subscribers. He said that a price war to gain subscribers will be unfavourable for the mobile providers, as it will further drive down margins. On the other hand, Alfie said that there is more room for growth for fixed-line providers like Telekom Malaysia Bhd (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 0.9) and Time dotCom Bhd (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 0.6), as companies are expected to expand their portfolio of services to include ICT solutions. \\u201cFixed-line providers are now starting to become ICT providers. They are beginning to offer a few IT services, rolling out these services in stages,\\u201d he said. Alfie explained that this is mainly due to a shift in user requirements, as enterprise users now require ICT services such as cloud and data centre services, instead of just connectivity. Capitalising on their existing network, fixed-line providers can potentially provide end-to-end services, ranging from fixed-line connectivity to ICT solutions such as cloud and data centre services. With the expansion of their products and services, telco companies are now entering the IT market. \\u201cBy going into the IT market, they are going to triple their addressable market to RM15 billion, from their current revenue of around RM5 billion. \\u201cHowever, it will not be an easy market for the fixed-line telcos, as the IT market is currently being held by established IT players like Hewlett-Packard, IBM and CSC,\\u201d he said. Alfie noted that telco players in countries like Australia and Singapore are already competing with IT players on a level playing field in providing ICT products and solutions, and expects the same for Malaysian companies in the future. He expects the shift in the focus of telcos to providing ICT services will support the revenue growth of fixed-line companies, forecasting a 7% year-on-year expansion in 2015 to RM9.8 billion.

But since U Mobile has finally drawn earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (Ebitda), it is definitely on the road to an initial public offering (IPO). After growing its subscriber base to over four million before its eighth year of business, Wong believed there is more room for U Mobile to grow, and could draw net profit next year. He said U Mobile\\u2019s target market is youths, who make up the bulk of the country\\u2019s population and are data-hungry. \\u201cWe can go for listing now, for sure, because we\\u2019ve met certain criteria [for the IPO]. But we want to ensure that when we indeed go for an IPO, we can deliver value to shareholders. We also need to achieve economies of scale and be sustainable for at least a few quarters before we can think of going public,\\u201d Wong said in an interview with The Edge Financial Daily. He denied market rumour of a possible merger-and-acquisition (M&A) exercise between U Mobile and REDtone International Bhd, both of which are affiliated with Tan Sri Vincent Tan. \\u201cThere are no talks with REDtone. And there is no discussion on this (M&A) at the shareholders\\u2019 level, at least, not that I know of. As far as we at U Mobile are concerned, it\\u2019s business as usual,\\u201d Wong added. Late last year when Tan\\u2019s Berjaya Corp Bhd accumulated shares in REDtone (Fundamental: 2.3; Valuation: 0.3) to a level nearing the mandatory general offer level, it sparked speculation of a possible M&A between REDtone and U Mobile. Between Dec 11, 2014 and Jan 7, 2015, Berjaya Corp bought 96.59 million REDtone shares and raised its stake from 12.63% to 30.77%. Additionally, on Dec 11 Berjaya Corp bought REDtone\\u2019s derivatives and ended up owning 128.48 million units of the ACE Market telco player\\u2019s irredeemable convertible unsecured loan stock and 20.1 million warrants. Theoretically, had Berjaya Corp exercised all those derivatives, it would have become REDtone\\u2019s largest shareholder with a 45.29% stake and consequently trigger a general offer. U Mobile, meanwhile, is one of Tan\\u2019s personal investment ventures. He owns 44.67% of the telco. The other shareholders are Temasek Holdings\\u2019 unit Straits Mobile Investments Pte Ltd (with a 49% stake) and Magnum Bhd (6.33%). \\u201cListing [U Mobile] is a given. [Telcos] will constantly need investment in new technologies, and technology is now updated at a much faster rate,\\u201d said Wong. For now, U Mobile\\u2019s liabilities mainly comprise vendors\\u2019 credit, which Wong said is normal for businesses in their early stages. He added that U Mobile\\u2019s recent RM1.5 billion network expansion programme was mostly financed by its shareholders. By the end of this year, U Mobile will have 1,000 3G network towers and another 1,000 4G LTE towers to enhance its connection. As at Dec 31, 2013 (FY13), U Mobile\\u2019s total liabilities of RM676.71 million were 1.94 times its shareholders\\u2019 funds of RM348.47 million, according to filings with the Companies Commission of Malaysia. However, Wong said in the \\u201ctraditional sense\\u201d of gearing \\u2014 the measure of a company\\u2019s borrowings to financial institutions \\u2014 U Mobile\\u2019s debt level is about 20% to 30% of its equity. \\u00a0 Growing above the industry average Also in FY13, U Mobile\\u2019s revenue was RM919.17 million, which was nearly double of the previous year\\u2019s sales. After-tax loss was cut by 18% to RM363.24 million. Based on Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission\\u2019s Industry Performance Report for 2013, U Mobile had 4.5 million subscribers, which made up 10.3% of Malaysia\\u2019s mobile phone market share. The report did not differentiate between active and non-active subscribers. Nonetheless, on a total subscriber basis, U Mobile has eaten up the market shares of the \\u201cBig Three\\u201d (DiGi.Com Bhd, Maxis Bhd and Celcom Axiata Bhd) over the years (see chart), with the telco still having less than half of the subscribers of its closest competitor, DiGi had. Last September, U Mobile initiated its Vision 2,000,000 campaign, in which it planned to add two million subscribers before 2014 ended. It succeeded in doing so two weeks ahead of the deadline. However, Wong declined to reveal U Mobile\\u2019s current subscriber numbers, or its market share. He said U Mobile managed to make over RM1 billion in revenue in FY14, and briefly broke even at the Ebitda level. He is confident that U Mobile can grow \\u201cabove the industry average\\u201d and break new turnover record in FY15. \\u201cWe have a few ongoing initiatives. So maybe by the second half of this year our Ebitda will turn positive. We are targeting at least next year for profit,\\u201d he added. But with telco services regarded as parity products, what distinguishes U Mobile from the Big Three players? Wong said U Mobile is focused on delivering value to Malaysia\\u2019s youth \\u2014 \\u201cthe 15- to 24-year-olds\\u201d \\u2014 who are heavy users of Internet data. \\u201cWe pride ourselves on being the best in terms of customer experience when it comes to mobile Internet. We are currently ahead of the other three [major players] in terms of customer satisfaction, based on various independent surveys. That\\u2019s why we came up with [the investment of building] 2,000 network sites, which will be completed by the end of this year,\\u201d he said. Wong said U Mobile was the first telco in Malaysia to provide 42Mbps connection to mobile devices, and is also looking at making smart devices more affordable for its target market. He added that U Mobile had been in talks with a few companies to provide machine-to-machine connectivity, which could be another revenue stream for the company. It is only a matter of time when the market is ready to use such technology, he said. \\u00a0 This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on February 23, 2015."}, "398": {"date_posted": "30/1/2015", "title": "Foreign selling of equities done with", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: Selling on Malaysian equities by foreign investors is mainly done with, with the country remaining very much on the radar of investors, according to Maybank IB Research.

This is to be expected since investors generally do not like uncertainties, it said, adding that Malaysia\\u2019s net oil-exporting status weakened the investment case. It said investors\\u2019 reduced exposure was evident from the weak ringgit, down 13% versus the US dollar from a high of 3.146 on Aug 27, 2014. The research house said Bursa Malaysia\\u2019s fund flow data showed that foreign investors had net sold RM2.4 billion of Malaysian equities since early this year until Jan 22, adding on to a net sale of RM6.9 billion in 2014. \\u201cIn the last few trading days, foreign investors have, however, turned net buyers. \\u201cForeigners\\u2019 position is still of a net buy of RM7.1 billion since 2012, and RM24.9 billion since 2010,\\u201d it said. Maybank IB said Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak\\u2019s announcement on Jan 20 on the government\\u2019s revenue enhancement and measures to cut operating expenditure to support a revised 3.2% fiscal deficit target for 2015 (versus 3% previously), and a lower 4.5% to 5.5% real gross domestic product growth forecast for 2015 (5% to 6% previously), was positive on sentiment as it shows attentiveness in dealing with the issues at hand. \\u201cThe prevailing concern, however, is of low crude oil price sustaining over an extended period, and thus, the impact on the fiscal deficit beyond 2015. \\u201cIn addition, near-term headwinds include the 6% GST (goods and services tax) implementation come April 1, 2015 and rating agencies\\u2019 review of Malaysia\\u2019s sovereign debt rating by mid-2015,\\u201d it said. Maybank IB said it continues to expect the volatility in FX (foreign exchange), bonds and equities to stay high in first quarter of 2015 (1Q15), and cautiousness to prevail in 2Q15 due to the GST implementation. It said the 11th Malaysia Plan (2016-2020), to be unveiled in May, is critical in addressing rating agencies\\u2019 concerns over Malaysia\\u2019s \\u201cdependence on commodities\\u201d and it should offer insight into fiscal consolidation efforts in balancing a high-income economy target. The research house also continued to advocate a defensive strategy for equities. It said telco and power stocks like Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.8) offer less earnings downside risks. \\u201cWith all telco stocks being syariah-compliant, sector valuations should at least sustain.

The JV company, Adknowledge Asia Pacific Pte Ltd (Adknowledge Asia), will work with businesses, advertising agencies and mobile application developers in the region to provide data-driven advertising strategies to raise brand awareness and drive sales and app installs through digital video, mobile, and social media marketing. ADA has an 80% stake in the JV company, in which it has invested US$9 million (RM31.01 million).\\u00a0 Axiata Digital Services Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Mohd Khairil Abdullah, who also oversees Axiata\\u2019s companies and joint ventures in digital advertising, believes that Axiata could leverage on Adknowledge\\u2019s technology to offer a better proposition to larger advertisers in the fast growing digital advertising market in the the region. Khairil said he is expecting the JV to start generating revenue this year, but didn\\u2019t specify a target. The revenue, he added, would be reinvested to scale up the company. The new venture comes at a time when Axiata\\u2019s earnings had slipped 11.75% to RM631.03 million in its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2014 (3QFY14), compared with RM769.78 million in 3QFY13. Khairil, however, said contribution from digital advertising to the group\\u2019s earnings will still be relatively small in the foreseeable future. Digital advertisement spending worldwide is expected to reach US$154.29 billion this year and Asia-Pacific is anticipated to be the second-largest region for the sector. The region accounted for 28.2% of total spending last year, after North America, due to the rapid adoption of smart devices and changing video viewership patterns, according to emarket.com. Adknowledge Asia managing director Krishna Krovi said the company plans to be the market leader in the region in three years. \\u201cAdknowledge [Asia] has been in social media marketing since 2008.

Under the revised Budget 2015 announced by Najib last Tuesday, the government is seeking an additional RM400 million in dividends from GLCs and GLICs to help supplement its revenue amid falling crude oil prices. On the macro front, the government\\u2019s urge for more dividends from such institutions would help shore up investors\\u2019 interests, said Areca Capital Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Danny Wong. \\u201cWith the government calling for more dividends, this could also hopefully attract foreign funds and indirectly help ease the burden of the weaker ringgit,\\u201d Wong told The Edge Financial Daily. However, JF Apex Securities Bhd senior analyst Lee Cherng Wee said whether GLCs could pay more dividends would ultimately depend on their ability to grow earnings substantially amid a tougher economic climate. Already, many research houses are forecasting a mere single-digit corporate earnings growth this year.\\u00a0 CIMB Research, for one, is projecting 8% growth in Malaysia\\u2019s corporate earnings in 2015, a figure that is nothing to shout about given the projected inflation rate as high as 4% this year, with the impending implementation of the goods and services tax. \\u201cIf earnings don\\u2019t grow as much, GLCs would then have to increase their payout ratios in response to the government\\u2019s needs,\\u201d said a head of research.  \\u201cSome of the GLCs have big capital expenditure (capex) requirements but if the government asked them to pay more dividends, they will still have to oblige,\\u201d he added, citing the case of Petroliam Nasional Bhd. While the national oil firm\\u2019s management had expressed its reservations on raising dividends, the government has repeatedly \\u201creminded\\u201d the former that it makes the ultimate decision on the level of dividends that the national oil firm has to pay. Looking at the list of selected GLCs (see table), most have retained earnings that are multifold of their 12-month trailing net profit.\\u00a0 An analyst pointed out that S P Setia Bhd, in which Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) is the major shareholder, is capable of paying a bigger dividend, as there is no major land banking exercise in store in its financial year ending Oct 31, 2015 (FY15). \\u201cS P Setia has no big plans so far,\\u201d said the analyst. The property developer (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 1.2) has a dividend policy of distributing at least 50% of its net profit, with its dividend of 9.7 sen per share in FY14 accounting for about 60% of its earnings per share. With retained earnings that were four times its FY14 net profit of RM405.68 million and no major land acquisitions announced, the group looks to be able to distribute more dividends, some said. Meanwhile, another of PNB\\u2019s listed conglomerates, Sime Darby Bhd (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.3), has retained earnings of RM28.9 billion, which is 8.59 times its trailing 12-month net profit of RM3.36 billion. In addition, its net gearing level is also low at 0.23 times. Sime Darby has a pending deal to acquire New Britain Palm Oil Ltd for some RM5.63 billion. But after this, analysts don\\u2019t expect a major acquisition by the group, at least in the short term. Nevertheless, weak palm oil prices and the slowdown in its China vehicle distribution business may dent Sime Darby\\u2019s profitability and crimp its dividends, some said. AllianceDBS Research, in a note last Friday, said companies owned by Khazanah Nasional Bhd are more likely to be the ones asked to pay more dividends, compared with other GLCs that are largely owned by trust funds managed by PNB or the Employees Provident Fund. \\u201cIn 2013, Khazanah contributed RM650 million in dividends to the government. This suggests that dividends from Khazanah will need to be ramped up significantly in order to achieve the [additional] RM400 million target,\\u201d said the research house in the note. AllianceDBS believes the four GLCs that could give out more dividends are Axiata Group Bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 0.9), Time DotCom Bhd (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 0.6), Petronas Gas Bhd (PetGas) (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 0.9), and MISC Bhd (fundamental: 1.6; valuation: 1.8).\\u00a0 Axiata and Time are majority owned by Khazanah, while PetGas and MISC are majority owned by Petronas. \\u201cBased on our analysis, Axiata is likely to be the major contributor as it has the capacity to raise its payout ratio from 80% (our current estimate) to 100%, given its strong free cash flow from Malaysian operations. If this happens, this will raise RM205 million in additional dividends for Khazanah,\\u201d AllianceDBS explained. JF Apex\\u2019s Lee, who tracks telecommunications stocks, said telcos will have to balance between dividend payout and allocation for their capex. \\u201cTelcos have high capex commitments because they have to build infrastructure. For Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), should it get the government\\u2019s go-ahead to start its second phase of high-speed broadband this year, its cash might be constrained by the huge capex,\\u201d he said. Like Axiata, TM is majority owned by Khazanah. Telcos are seen as dividend-seekers\\u2019 favourites due to their stable earnings and generous payout ratios, although currently their yields are in the range of just 4%. Khazanah owns 28.73% of TM (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 0.9) and 37.89% of Axiata. In the past four financial quarters, TM paid out a dividend of 25.8 sen per share, which is nearly 97% of its earnings per share of 26.61 sen in the same period. Currently, TM has a policy of paying out either RM700 million or a maximum of 90% of its net profit, whichever is higher. Either way, TM\\u2019s dividend payout has a limit and is constrained by its performance. Back to Petronas-owned listed companies, while they might be facing earnings headwinds given the depressed crude oil prices, they are lowly geared.\\u00a0 Two of them, PetGas and Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd (PChem), are in net cash positions. However, AllianceDBS said that both PetGas and PChem (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 1.2) might be constrained by capex requirements for the Pengerang regasification terminal project and the Refinery And Petrochemical Integrated Development. While no GLC has come out since to declare bumper dividends or bigger payouts, many of the blue-chips have seen their share prices move up.\\u00a0 Between last Tuesday and Friday, Axiata rose 22 sen or 3.15% to RM7.21; Sime Darby gained 27 sen or 2.91% to RM9.56; Petronas Dagangan Bhd jumped 86 sen or 5.27% to RM17.18; and PetGas, meanwhile, rose 96 sen or 4.49% to RM22.36. Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB), majority owned by Khazanah, was also instrumental in lifting the benchmark index back to the 1,800 level last week.\\u00a0 Save for last Tuesday, the utility giant was consistently in the top gainers rank and it closed the week 60 sen or 4.14% higher to record a fresh high of RM15.10. While TNB (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1) has reported a 34% jump in its net profit for the first quarter ended Nov 30, 2014 and is expected to deliver record earnings due to lower coal cost and a tariff hike last year, analysts said it might be needing cash for its new power plants, hence potentially capping its dividend payout.  \nThe Edge Research\\u2019s fundamental score reflects a company\\u2019s profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers.

I think that is going to be challenging [going forward] because each one of us has to show growth and it means that there will be higher competition in the market,\\u201d U Mobile Sdn Bhd chief executive officer (CEO) Wong Heang Tuck told The Edge Financial Daily. He also termed 2014 a challenging year for all telco providers, with the industry by and large posting relatively flat revenue. Nevertheless, he said U Mobile has shown good growth in 2014 and said customers can expect \\u201cmore innovative services and ideas\\u201d from the group next year. \\u201cThe impact of the goods and services tax [GST] that will come in on April 1 remains to be seen. Hopefully, the knee-jerk reaction won\\u2019t last too long and that in terms of telco consumption, it will come back to normal,\\u201d he said. As one of the smaller telco players in the country, U Mobile wants to bring its services on par with the three industry giants \\u2014 Axiata Group Bhd (Celcom brand), Maxis Bhd and DiGi.Com Bhd \\u2014 with an aggressive rollout of 2,000 new 3G and 4G LTE network sites by end-2015, costing a total of RM1.5 billion. U Mobile also aims to improve its bottom line performance next year, having narrowed its losses by 18.27% to RM363.2 million for financial year 2014 ended Dec 31, from a net loss of RM444.4 million a year before. Wong also said once the company has completed its site rollout, it will look into expanding its coverage and services in Sabah and Sarawak, where it already has two service centres in Kuching and Kota Kinabalu. Relative newcomer Altel Communications Sdn Bhd foresees a significant impact on the company\\u2019s performance from the GST, but is unsure if it will be positive or negative. \\u201cWe are gearing up to face all possibilities with regards to the upcoming implementation of the GST. We have engaged a consultant to put together the best possible plan for our business,\\u201d said Altel CEO Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Yaacob in a recent interview. Operating since July 2012, Altel is a subsidiary of Puncak Semangat Sdn Bhd, which is controlled by tycoon Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Al-Bukhary. The company has about 279,000 active subscribers and plans to launch postpaid services by the end of the first quarter of this year. DiGi.Com CEO Lars Norling expects the industry to grow on positive momentum of data, but concurred that there would be increased competition and the continued tapering of revenue from voice and messaging (SMS) services. \\u201cMore Malaysians are gaining access to the Internet every day. There is also a rising number of smartphone users spending more time online and owning multiple devices. These trends have proliferated demand for Internet services and increased smartphone penetration in recent quarters,\\u201d he said in an email. Moving forward, Norling said DiGi.Com plans to reach out to more customers and drive consumption by making Internet services a part of its core offering. \\u201cWe have placed significant emphasis on ensuring a wide range of smart device bundles are made easily available to all segments of customers,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe robust demand for Internet services will fuel continued growth this year. We believe our stronger subscriber base ... will set a favourable trajectory and boost future service revenue,\\u201d he said. PublicInvest Research analyst Lee Wee Sieng opined that the telco industry had a good year in 2014, with DiGi.Com the top performer. \\u201cThat is to be expected, since they are now reaping the benefits of their network modernisation exercise, which was completed in late 2013,\\u201d he said. Lee said U Mobile had also performed well in 2014 due to the lower prices of its products and services, but raised the question of how long the company could sustain that strategy. More intense competition notwithstanding, Lee does not see the possibility of a heightened price war erupting among telcos this year in their effort to expand the customer base. \\u201cThe big three have always been quite rational. I believe they wouldn\\u2019t want to rock the boat,\\u201d he said. As for 2015, Lee said his stock pick is Axiata, as two of the group\\u2019s subsidiaries, XL Axiata and Celcom Axiata, are expected to post better performances, having weighed on the overall group performance last year. As at Sept 30, Celcom\\u2019s gross revenue had decreased 3.8% year-on-year (y-o-y) while profit after tax declined 14.6% to RM1.33 billion. XL meanwhile, posted a 2.2% decline y-o-y in gross revenue and a loss after tax of RM251.1 million. In March last year, XL acquired another Indonesian telco provider, PT Axis Telekom Indonesia, for US$865 million (RM3.08 billion), which is expected to help XL gain extra spectrum capacity, enhance its asset utilisation, and give it a larger subscriber base. \\u00a0 This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on January 14, 2015."}, "402": {"date_posted": "12/1/2015", "title": "Maybank IB\\u2019s top picks for 2015", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: Maybank Investment Bank Bhd (Maybank IB) has named Gamuda Bhd, Hartalega Holdings Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) and Axiata Group Bhd among its top picks for 2015 as it advocates a defensive portfolio for the year.

Maybank IB director and head of equities CK Lim said stocks with higher yields will be another theme for 2015. \\u201cThat basically means utilities and telecommunications as well. What we like is the consistency in revenue, which brings about a stable set of results and obviously, in a tough market, investors don\\u2019t really like surprises,\\u201d he said.

The research house named TNB (TP: RM16), Axiata (TP: RM7.80) and Star Publications (Malaysia) Bhd (RM2.65) as its stock picks based on yield. Besides that, Ong said mergers and acquisitions would be another talking point for the year, with stocks in focus including WCT Holdings Bhd, which could see the listing of its retail assets in the fourth quarter of 2015, S P Setia Bhd on a potential property asset injection by Permodalan Nasional Bhd, and NCB Holdings Bhd, also on a possible injection by MMC Corp Bhd. He added that Sarawak stocks such as Cahya Mata Sarawak Bhd (CMS) (TP: RM4.80) and Hock Seng Lee Bhd (HSL) (TP: RM2.15) are also closely monitored in view of the Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy (Score). \\u201cCMS is very strong on the Score theme and there will be robust and predictable demand for cement and construction materials,\\u201d he said, adding that HSL could also see the momentum of its order book continue.

M & A Securities Research head Rosnani Rasul said Wall Street ended marginally lower on Tuesday as sentiment was hampered by global economic weakness, China\\u2019s decision to tighten liquidity, and Greece\\u2019s new political uncertainty. \\u00a0 Rosnani said economic uncertainties from Japan and China reared their ugly heads yesterday, hurting sentiment. She said Wall Street had a field day yesterday with China's reported tightening of liquidity supply in the banking system, pointing to higher cost of borrowing which could hurt economic growth. Rosnani said if China\\u2019s recent export deceleration was not enough, developments in China\\u2019s banking system had certainly pushed investors to the edge. In Greece, presidential election had been brought forward by two months, the outcome of which could make or break the country's bailout plan. \\u201cWe, at this stage, do not discount entirely Greece opting out of the Eurozone despite the bailout plan as Greece being out of the pact would be better for their survival, given the fact that they badly need monetary independence in order to grow,\\u201d she said.

The expert stock picker also said investors should look at stocks in Malaysia individually to determine what the growth rates are going to be and work out how much more these stocks should be worth. \\u201cAt this stage, there are a number of stocks that you can buy, but I wouldn\\u2019t rush in,\\u201d he was reported to have said on Oct 20. Yet rather than recommending the safety in yields, Mobius could really be looking for entry points to quality growth stocks. In his Oct 28 blog post headlined \\u201cFocus on long-term fundamentals, not fears\\u201d, he says now seems like a good time to examine the role of investor psychology in the market. \\u201cI can\\u2019t say when this current bout of market volatility will end, but I can say, based on decades of experience navigating the markets, it won\\u2019t last forever. And it will likely bring potential opportunities for savvy investors who know where to look.\\u201d Incidentally, Mobius\\u2019 blog post came just a day ahead of the US Federal Reserve\\u2019s Oct 29 announcement of the end of its half-a-decade-long bond purchase programme \\u2014 the latest of which is better known as the third instalment of quantitative easing (QE3) \\u2014 meant to jumpstart economic growth. The next day, the US economy surprised the market by reporting its strongest back-to-back growth in over a decade. After growing 4.5% in 2Q2014, the US economy grew 3.5% in 3Q, beating median forecasts of 3%, according to Bloomberg data. Even before that, investors wanting to look past China\\u2019s bout of poor data releases in August found comfort in the government\\u2019s effort to support its 7.5% GDP growth target for 2014, including pumping US$81.4 billion (RMB500 billion) cash into the country\\u2019s five state-owned banks in September. So, is it time to switch from yield to growth, or at least consider doing so? Michael Kurtz, chief Asia equity strategist at Nomura International (Hong Kong) Ltd, whose team upgraded Malaysia to \\u201coverweight from neutral in an Asean context\\u201d on Oct 8, thinks so. \\u201cWe are growing wary of yield\\u2019s relative performance prospects in the coming quarters \\u2026 Historically, dividend yield stocks tend to underperform the broad market when treasury yields are rising. And the accepted view is that QE tended to suppress yields by substantially augmenting the bid for bonds. So less or no QE should, other factors being equal, free up yields to rise as the Fed\\u2019s bid dries up,\\u201d Kurtz tells The Edge. \\u201cThe time to own dividend yield stocks is when bond yields are falling or likely to remain at the bottom indefinitely, not when yields are moving higher,\\u201d he adds, pointing out that rate strategists at Nomura expect treasury yields to rise \\u201croughly 60 basis points\\u201d from current levels by end-2015 as growth, wage inflation and higher short-term rates all get priced into the yield curve. \\u201cWe believe the point is near where demand growth in the US will begin registering more evident US wage inflation, which will have to get priced into long-end treasury yields.\\u201d Lim Chee Sing, executive chairman of RHB Research Institute in Kuala Lumpur, concurs. If nothing else, the end of QE3 means that investors will have to prepare for the next policy move by the Fed \\u201cand this is none other than the normalising of interest rates from an extremely low level\\u201d, he says. In short, interest rates will rise, but when? For now, most economists expect the Fed to hike rates by 3Q or 4Q2015, if not earlier. \\u201cIn a rising interest rate environment, high dividend-paying stocks that are trading at rich valuations may continue to lose their appeal as the spread between the dividend yield and interest rates [fixed-deposit or risk-free rate] will be narrowing,\\u201d Lim explains. That\\u2019s why \\u201cgrowth over yield\\u201d is what is being recommended over a 12-month time frame by Mixo Das, Nomura\\u2019s Asia ex-Japan equity strategist in Hong Kong, \\u201cfor lower beta and lower correlation to carry trade returns\\u201d. \\u201cThe most important deciding factor there is the direction of bond yields (and thus nominal growth expectations and Fed policy expectations). Earlier this month, the financial markets were pricing in sharp headwinds to growth, which we thought were overdone. \\u201cEconomic data, on the whole, has been mixed, but this only means that the outlook for 2015 [which already expects accelerating global growth from 3.2% in 2014 to 3.6% in 2015] should remain unchanged,\\u201d Das tells The Edge, pointing out that consensus expectations of the Fed\\u2019s first rate hike happening had moved backwards to August from October 2015 after last Wednesday\\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee announcement. To be sure, Das expects 2015 to see \\u201coccasional periods of risk aversion, but the overall direction of bond yields should be higher\\u201d. For Malaysia specifically, Das had, in a recent note, said risks to earnings outlook remain beyond the near term but there are stock-specific re-rating opportunities. \\u201cCapturing earnings growth at a reasonable price will be a key differentiator of performance,\\u201d he writes in an Oct 15 note. Nomura\\u2019s top picks on a 12-month time frame include Malayan Banking Bhd, IJM Corp Bhd, Gamuda Bhd, Mah Sing Group Bhd, Sunway Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd and Genting Malaysia Bhd. Convinced that the US and global economies will continue to pick up in the months ahead, Nomura\\u2019s Kurtz is even more bullish on growth stocks. \\u201cDividend yield names could underperform even more if investors conclude in the months ahead that growth stocks look more interesting, leading to something of a mass exodus from yield.\\u201d Das adds, \\u201cThe other thing to remember is that yield as a style is a very crowded and expensive trade compared with its own past as well as relative to growth.\\u201d Put another way, the switch from yield to growth plays could also be spurred by the fact that yield stocks have already been chased high. \\u201cMore than 40% premium is currently being paid in global equity markets for the higher-yield quartile of stocks,\\u201d Kurtz says. Deep-pocketed pension funds, including the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), favour companies with strong cash flow and dividend-paying capability to add to their pool of realised investment gains to pay annual dividends to members. EPF a net seller For now, however, Bloomberg data lists the EPF as the \\u201ctop seller\\u201d of three of Malaysia\\u2019s four major telecoms stocks: DiGi.Com Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd and Maxis Bhd. Telecoms stocks are known for their dividends and are favourites during periods of slow growth. \\u00a0 Telekom\\u2019s stock price, in particular, has appreciated over 26% year to date and dividends pushed total returns to 40% over one year. DiGi\\u2019s stock price is up by a fifth YTD and has delivered total returns of over 27%. The EPF still owned 12.73% of DiGi as at Oct 27, but had sold nearly 50 million shares or 0.64% in the past three months from 13.37% as at July 22, filings with Bursa Malaysia show. It sold about 43 million shares or 1.36% of Telekom in the past three months and held a 13.14% stake as at Oct 24 compared with 14.5% as at Aug 5. Filings also showed the retirement fund sold about 11 million Maxis shares in recent months with its holding standing at 6.55% as at Oct 27 compared with 6.7% as at July 7. Based on the lowest analyst dividend forecasts on Bloomberg of 23 sen and 21 sen respectively for Maxis and Telekom, there is a downside of 2.5% for Maxis and 16.7% for Telekom from their respective Oct 30 close of RM6.74 and RM7.20 if one used 3.5% yield as a minimum expectation. For DiGi, the upside potential is 13.9% to RM6.86, using the lowest dividend forecast of 24 sen and assuming 3.5% yield. Forecast dividend per share (DPS) for Maxis ranges from 23 sen to 32 sen and averages at 27.9 sen, which values the stock at RM6.98, assuming 4% yield. The DPS forecast for Telekom ranges from 21 sen to 31 sen and averages at 27.3 sen, which values the stock at RM6.83 if one assumed 4% yield. The minimum is above 19.1 sen based on its RM700 million minimum annual dividend promise. Perhaps spurred by expectations of a business trust structure happening, the forecast for DiGi\\u2019s dividend is higher at 24 sen to 29 sen and averages at 26.2 sen, which values the stock at RM8.80 if one assumed 4% yield. Among banking stocks \\u2014 which Mobius also recently reported to like, alongside generous dividend payers such as British American Tobacco (M) Bhd, Guinness Anchor Bhd and Carlsberg Brewery (M) Bhd \\u2014 the EPF pared about 22 million shares or 1.21% of Hong Leong Bank Bhd in the past four months. It still held 13.15% as at Oct 27, down from 14.36% as at June 19. It is worth noting that the EPF said due to its size, it usually chooses to take profit when there is enough buying interest in the market. To be sure, the higher borrowing costs that come with the end of ultra-low interest rates in the easy-money QE era, which drove asset prices higher and fuelled credit growth, are supposed to mean that the US economy is in better shape. As RHB\\u2019s Lim says, the end of QE3 \\u201cimplies that the Fed is increasingly more confident of the US economic recovery and there isn\\u2019t a need for investors to hide behind defensive and high-dividend stocks\\u201d. Still, he reminds investors that the inability of the major world economies to transition from a recovery to an economic boom since the 2008/09 global financial crisis suggests that lack of growth, specifically earnings growth on the part of corporates, is the key problem. \\u201cThis means that to outperform the market, one would need to identify growth stocks to make a difference. At the end of the day, it is earnings growth that will create new shareholder value and bring down valuations to a more attractive level,\\u201d he remarks. In any case, current consensus shows there may well be some six to nine months before interest rates begin to rise. For investors who still want to have yield stocks in their portfolio, see Page 10 for a selection of those with positive quarter earnings growth, single-digit PE multiples and at least 4% yield, according to Bloomberg data.

Nazri said the renewed Japanese optimism reflected hopes that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe seek a fresh mandate \\u00a0(delay a planned tax rise and undertake further reforms and fiscal action) in order to boost growth after Japan unexpectedly slipped into a technical recession. \\u201cThis should complement the positive Asian regional catalyst following the stock connect scheme between the Hong Kong and Shanghai bourses. \\u201cMeanwhile, we expect weaker global manufacturing activity in China to exert moderate downward pressure on global commodities in the next few weeks,\\u201d he said. \\u00a0 Nazri, who is also president of the Malaysian Association of Technical Analysts, said that on the technical front, most FBM KLCI daily oscillators were pointing sideways suggesting a declining bearish momentum and limited downside space. \\u201cThe local benchmark however closed below the 20-day, 50-day and 200-day moving average suggesting weak downside across all time frames. \\u201cThe FBM KLCI has risen 92 points or 5.2% (high-low range of 1766 to 1858 in the last two weeks of October) on a fairly good volume which mean we now expect the FBM KLCI to remain buoyant and maintain support above the 1800 level,\\u201d he said.

However, the index rebounded from the support level we anticipated last week at 1,810 points, which is the 50% retracement level of the bullish trend that started in mid-October. The price rebounded yesterday after testing and breaking below the support level to close at 1,806.48 points on Monday. The rebound yesterday indicates that there is support on the 50% retracement level. However, the momentum is bearish as the momentum oscillators like RSI and Momentum Oscillator fell below its mid-level. Furthermore, the index has also fallen below the middle band of the Bollinger Bands indicator. The index has now retraced to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the bullish trend that started in mid-October. The index has rebounded from this level but it has to increase further to boost market confidence. The rebound may be capped at the immediate resistance level at 1,830 points. However, we expect the index to decline to the psychological level at 1,800 points if the index failed to rebound.  \nBenny Lee is chief market strategist for Jupiter Securities Sdn Bhd.

All the index\\u2019s daily signals turned negative recently.

The KLCI\\u2019s simple-moving averages (18, 40 and 20) depict an emerging downtrend for its daily and weekly charts. With the prices breaking below the larger and lower Rising Wedge support line on Sept 15, 2014, we foresee longer-term selling activities for the index. The selling pressure would be intense and persistent if and when the index rebounds. Downside targets for this move are at 1,730 (in the short term) and 1,682 (in the medium term). Due to the softer tone for the KLCI index, we are recommending a chart \\u201csell\\u201d on British American Tobacco (M) Bhd (BAT). BAT turned into downtrend since hitting its recent 52-week high of RM73.48 in August 2014. At Maybank Investment Bank Bhd, our fundamental analyst has an unchanged \\u201csell\\u201d call on BAT and target price of RM62. In a surprise move in early September 2014, BAT announced an 8% to 9% price hike per cigarette box. This was its third price increase in just over a year, but BAT reversed its decision after two weeks. Despite the surprising U-turn to pre-Sept 8 price hikes, our analyst\\u2019s forecast remains unchanged as he had expected higher operating costs and assumed a larger 12% year-on-year volume contraction will mitigate the higher revenue from the price hike. With the reversion of the price hike, our analyst currently assumes a 6% per annum contraction. A check of the Bloomberg consensus reveals that 17 research houses have coverage on BAT. Of the 17, there are only two \\u201cbuy\\u201d calls, seven \\u201chold\\u201d calls and eight \\u201csell\\u201d calls. This stock currently trades at expensive price-to-earnings ratio of 21.6 times while its price-to-book value ratio of 34.9 times indicates that its share price is trading at a premium to its book value. The reported shareholding changes on Bloomberg revealed net selling by mostly foreign institution funds over the past month. BAT\\u2019s chart trend on the daily time frame is very weak and is firmly down. Its share price made a large plunge since its daily Wave-5 and recent all-time high of RM73.48 in August 2014. Since that RM73.48 high, BAT plunged to its recent October 2014 low of RM65.14. As prices broke above their recent key critical support levels of RM71.50 and RM71.20, look to sell BAT on any rebound to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to medium-term downtrends for this stock. The daily indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD and Oscillator) have issued \\u201csell\\u201d signals and now depict very firm indications of BAT\\u2019s eventual move towards much lower levels. It would attract very weak buying interest at the support levels of RM63.05, RM65.14 and RM65.50. We expect BAT to attract major liquidation towards its resistance levels of RM66.72, RM71.20 and RM71.50. Its downside targets are located at RM62.75, RM61.90 and RM56.90.  \nLee Cheng Hooi is the regional chartist at Maybank Kim Eng.

The market was cautious about the economic development in Europe. The strong US dollar was predominantly caused by the weakening euro, hammered by worsening economic numbers and the further easing of the monetary policy by the European Central Bank in the past month. This caused the ringgit to weaken against the greenback. The declining trading volume indicates market cautiousness. The average daily volume fell to 2.2 billion shares last week compared with 2.8 billion shares two weeks ago. Average trading value was RM2 billion compared with RM2.1 billion two weeks ago, and this indicates that there is a shift in the trading of lower cap stocks to higher cap stocks. Total market valuation fell RM6 billion from last week to RM1,772 billion. Retail market confidence deteriorated and foreign institutions are not so keen as the ringgit weakened against the US dollar. Local institutions were net buyers last week at RM231.5 million.

Crude oil declined only 0.3% in a week to US$92.81 per barrel. Crude palm oil continued to increase after a rebound two weeks ago on stronger demand after the government provided export tax exemptions and a weaker ringgit. Crude palm oil futures on Bursa Malaysia increased 3.2% in a week to RM2,099 per tonne. The ringgit weakened against the US dollar from RM3.20 per US$1 a week ago to RM3.23. The KLCI failed to turn bullish last week as it failed to break above the immediate resistance level at 1,880 points. The KLCI has been whipsawing against the declining short-term 30-day moving average in the past two weeks but started to decline and break below the moving average and the immediate support level at 1,860 points last week, indicating that the trend has turned bearish. Momentum indicators like the RSI, MACD and Momentum Oscillator are showing that the bearish momentum is getting stronger. These indicators broke support levels and the MACD has also fallen below its moving average or trigger line. Furthermore, the KLCI has fallen below the bottom band of the Bollinger Bands indicator. Therefore, the strong selling pressure may cause the market to continue to decline in the short term. The index failed to break above the immediate resistance level and broke below the support level instead. Technically, the KLCI is continuing its short-term downtrend while remaining bullish in the short term. The long-term 200-day moving average is at 1,850 points and this is where the KLCI is expected to retest. A break below the support range between 1,840 and 1,850 points could turn the long-term trend into a bearish one with the next technical support can only be seen at 1,800 points.\n\\u00a0 \nBenny Lee is chief market strategist for Jupiter Securities Sdn Bhd.

OCK is also planning to increase its business footprint in several emerging markets, such as Cambodia and Myanmar. \\u201cWe will [continually] participate in project tendering [in the telecommunication sector],\\u201d said Ooi, adding that the company was also looking at opportunities to outsource its expertise to mobile operators there. \\u201cIn addition, we also intend to own a licence to build telecommunication sites and further explore these emerging markets.\\u201d Meanwhile, Ooi said OCK had secured a fibre trenching work contract from Telecom Cambodia worth some RM20 million. \\u201cBesides this, we were also awarded two contracts from Smart Axiata, a subsidiary of Axiata Group Bhd, to deploy telecommunication transmission towers in Cambodia,\\u201d he said. He said OCK also owns a subsidiary in Fuzhou, China, which serves as a platform for the company to outsource its manpower and prepare for opportunities arising from the telco infrastructure upgrading works there. OCK\\u2019s current order book stands at about RM70 million to RM80 million which is expected to keep the company busy throughout next year. OCK, equipped with Network Facility Provider Individual Licence (NFP), plans to build or acquire more telecommunication sites locally to boost its recurring revenue by leasing back the sites to telcos. Other than those that it manages for the telcos, OCK currently owns 240 telcommunication sites that it leased back to the telcos. It aims to increase the number of owned sites in the country to 300 by year-end. \\u201cWe are in talks with several small-site owners at the moment but nothing has been firmed up yet,\\u201d Ooi said, adding that the company did not set a specific time frame as it is an ongoing process. \\u201cAcquiring a telecommunication site is not an easy task. [The telecom site] has to get approval from the authorities before it can proceed,\\u201d he said. The funding for the acquisition of the sites, among others, will come from the RM150 million sukuk proceeds OCK raised last year, said Ooi, adding that the proceeds could fund its capital expenditure requirements over a three- to four-year period. On a separate matter, OCK said it is eyeing to expand its green technology business, and looking at acquiring more solar farms. \\u201cHowever, the number would depend on the quota set by the government under the feed-in-tariff,\\u201d said Ooi. OCK owns a solar farm in Kelantan and had entered into engineering procurement construction with another three solar farms. Commenting on the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission\\u2019s (MCMC) plan to expand telecommunication coverage in rural areas, Ooi said he is still waiting for more information from MCMC which is expected by end of this month. Responding to the speculations that OCK is the frontrunner for a lion\\u2019s share of the projects to build more telecommunication towers in rural areas, Ooi said it is still early to say as every bidder has an equal chance. MCMC is planning to build 1,000 telecommunication towers nationwide in stages to improve the broadband usage rate and the network coverage in underserved areas. The first phase involves 400 towers while the second phase involves 300. The RM1.5 billion project is expected to be completed three years after its commencement. OCK closed unchanged at RM1.44 last Friday, with a market capitalisation of RM499.1 million. The stock has gained 44% from around RM1.00 in mid-March. RHB Research has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on OCK, with a target price of RM1.65, according to a poll by Bloomberg. \nThis article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on September 15, 2014. \\u00a0"}, "422": {"date_posted": "4/9/2014", "title": "Khazanah sells Islamic bonds in second offer in three weeks", "article": " \n(Sept 4): Malaysia\\u2019s sovereign wealth fund sold Islamic bonds for the second time in three weeks as it buys out the national airline.

After the benchmark S&P 500's latest record closing high - its fourth in the last five sessions - gains may be harder to come by until the market's direction becomes more clear.

Elsewhere, Asian shares rose in early trading on Friday, buoyed by another record close on Wall Street, while the dollar groaned under the pressure of slumping U.S. yields, according to Reuters.

Elsewhere, global equity markets turned\nhigher late on Friday after being down most of the session on concerns about\neconomic growth, while government debt prices fell on surprisingly strong U.S.\nhousing data, according to Reuters.  Major U.S. stock indexes were still on\ntrack for a negative week, with small-caps down for a fourth straight session,\ndespite the benchmark S&P 500 hitting a record high earlier in the week and\nWall Street turning slightly positive on Friday, it said.  Affin IB vice president and head of retail research Dr Nazri\nKhan said that going forward, he expects the local\nmarket to benefit from global weakness and brace for another stronger session\nriding on defensive funds inflow.\\u00a0\\u00a0 Nazri said further strength on top\nBursa dividend stocks namely Maybank, Axiata, TM, Digi, HLFG and IOICorp\nsuggest more upside bias for the FBM KLCI next week.  He said he expects a stronger trend of\nUSA economic readings and favourable start to first quarter earnings to support\na buy on weakness mentality in the FBM KLCI back toward 1,880, positioning for\nan advance to 1,900.  Nazri said the local index should hold\nthe upside gap at 1,867-1,873 following a good reaction to global central bank\npositive tone as reflected by the one-month-high-ringgit and\nrecord-closing-high of the FBM KLCI (1,879.83 on May 15, 2014).\\u00a0 \\u201cWe expect domestic buying momentum to\nincrease riding on three factors (1) Bursa resilience and defensive appeal (as\nit did during the past weak summer seasons May-July) (2) More rotation play\ntowards large cap stocks after the outperformance of FBMSmallCap, FBMFledgling\nand FBMAces Indices (3) More external funds inflow and blue chips positioning\nahead following the extra liquidity from Japan and Europe,\\u201d he said. \\u00a0 He said that on the technical front, the\nFBM KLCI looked set to test the psychological 1,900 support on high volume and\nrising oscillators (MACD, Stochastics) as the last week drive above 1,870 level\nturned the trend in favour of the bull in the near term.  He said any decisive break above the 1,880\nlevel would mark a significant turning point causing a flush of more buying up\nto 1,900, the major resistance level the market perceives as the next breakout\nprice target.  Nazri said technical indicators were\nstill positive with RSI, Stochastics and MACD hovering up and cutting above\ntheir signal line.  He said that from the market breadth\nperspective, there is a positive distribution with weekly advancers beat\ndecliners by a moderate 4 to 3 on a slightly heavier average daily trade of 2 billion\nshares worth RM2.1 billion.

The FBM KLCI mildly rebounded on strong bullish market performance in the US and rebounds in the regional markets. The KLCI increased only 0.3% in a week to 1,866.08 points on Monday after trading in a range of between 1,853.31 and 1,867.40 points. The index could have closed higher if it was not dragged down by strong selling in Petronas Dagangan Bhd (PetDag). Trading volume remained firm but relatively low compared to the previous months. This is an indication that the market is still being cautious. The average daily trading volume in the past one week was 1.7 billion shares. The average trading value was RM1.9 billion compared with RM1.7 billion two weeks ago, indicating the trading of higher priced stocks. Foreign institutions continued to be net buyers throughout last week. The stronger ringgit may be the catalyst for foreign buying. Net buying by foreign institutions was RM327.2 million while net selling by local institutions and retail investors stood at RM271.2 million and RM56.0 million respectively. In the KLCI, gainers beat decliners 19 to 8. Gainers were led by YTL Corp Bhd (+2.5%), Axiata Group Bhd (+2.2%) and Hong Leong Bank Bhd (+2.2%), while decliners were led by PetDag (-10.6%), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (-0.8%) and British American Tobacco (Malaysia) Bhd (-0.8%). Markets were directionless last week and this was a sign of cautiousness. Singapore\\u2019s Straits Times Index declined 0.6% in a week to 3,222.43 points on Monday. Hong Kong\\u2019s Hang Seng Index rose 1.3% in a week to 22,261.61 points and China\\u2019s Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index also increased 1.3% in a week to 2,052.87 points. The US Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1% in a week to 16,695.47 points.

The US dollar index rebounded strongly last week after the US Federal Reserve committed to continuing to keep interest rates low until the economic growth becomes steady. The US dollar index increased from 79.13 points a week ago to 79.96 points. Commodity Exchange Gold declined only 1.1% in a week to US$1,295.50 (RM4,197.42) an ounce. The New York Mercantile Exchange WTI crude rose 1.2% in a week to US$100.62 per barrel. The ringgit strengthened against the US dollar from 3.26 in the previous week to 3.23. Crude palm oil rebounded mildly, rising only 0.2% in a week to RM2,589 per tonne. The KLCI continued to trade within the support and resistance levels of the triangle chart pattern. The trend was bullish as the index stayed above the short-term 30-day moving average and above the Ichimoku Cloud. The short-term or immediate support level remained at 1,845 points and the immediate resistance level is at 1,870 points. The bullish trend should be able to continue if the index is able to break above the immediate resistance level. The momentum of the bullish trend is steady as momentum indicators like the RSI, MACD and Momentum Oscillator are above their mid-levels. Therefore, there is a high chance for the KLCI to test the resistance level at 1,870 points, thus continuing its uptrend. Furthermore, the Bollinger Bands are steadily expanding upwards and the index is trading above the middle band. If the index is able to break above the immediate resistance level of 1,870 points, it confirms the triangle pattern which has a short-term target at 1,900 points. I am expecting the market to be bullish this week as the technical indicators on the KLCI are being supported well. The index is expected to test this immediate resistance level this week and climb higher in the short term towards 1,900 points, unless there are any reversal indications. If the KLCI fails to break above 1,870 points, then expect it to further consolidate sideways. Daily FBM KLCI chart as at May 12, 2014.

Wall Street shares slipped and investors retreated to long-dated government debt on Friday, as enthusiasm over strong U.S. jobs growth was undercut by flat wages and a decline in the number of people looking for work. Traders also said that news on more violence in eastern Ukraine sparked a shift into the bond market that pushed the yield on the 30-year note to lows not seen since last June. Affin IB vice president and head of retail research Dr Nazri Khan said given the strong blue chips performance (led by Astro, Digi, Telekom and Maybank), he\\u00a0 expects the\\u00a0 FBM KLCI to build the second upleg and trend higher towards the psychological 1,900 level. \\u201cWe see signs of local optimism driven by European Central Bank and Bank of Japan aggressive fiscal stimulus and encouraging USA economic data. \\u201cWe note that global stocks are steady after the Federal Reserve continued to reduce its monthly bond buying by a mild amount and indicated the economy was improving at a modest pace,\\u201d he said. Nazri said investors believe the policy statement had been moderately bullish and was in line with expectations, reinforcing the view that tapering is on a gradual autopilot until its completion early next year. He said the chief concern for investors remained the impact of a possible USA/Europe sanction of Russia and its negative impacts on the global market. \\u201cWe however believe (based on previous crisis of USA sanctions), the global interruption of trade sanctions is generally short lived as confidence recover. \\u201cIn fact, (based on the strong global stock prices) there are evidence that the markets had already priced in the risk of Russian sanction and hence should trend higher next few weeks,\\u201d he said. On the home front, Nazri said the new landmark closer Malaysia-USA bilateral relations and Malaysia\\u2019s shift to targeted subsidies with the upcoming implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) would be a vote of confidence to upgrade Malaysia\\u2019s sovereign rating and to induce more investment from American multinationals over the medium term. \\u201cWe expect domestic buying momentum to increase riding on three factors (1) Bursa resilience and defensive appeal (as it did during the past weak summer seasons May-July) (2) More rotation play towards large cap stocks after the outperformance of FBMSmallCap, FBMFledgling and FBMAces Indices (3) More external funds inflow and bluechips positioning ahead following the extra liquidity from Japan and Europe. \\u201cOn the technical front, the near term bias has turned in favour of the bull camp with immediate support pegged near 1,860 level (20-day moving average) and 1,840 (50-day moving average) while resistance spotted near 1880 level (Dec 2013 all-time-high), followed by 1,900 psychological resistance,\\u201d he said. On the bigger picture, Nazri stressed that the long and medium term trend for Bursa composite index remains firmly up (drawing uptrendline from March 2009 low, September 2011 low and August 2013 low) as long as the local benchmark stays above 1,800 level which suggest any short term market weakness was superb buying opportunities. Meanwhile, any positive announcement on the USA-Malaysia new economic pacts following President Obama visit should draw more bulls back into Bursa, he said. Strategy wise, aggressive investors should long index futures on strength (after breakout above 1870 level, positioning for another test higher) while conservative investors should stick with event play blue chips (World Cup 2014) after the recent sell-off. These includes the likes of telco, consumer and media stocks which will benefit from World Cup seasons such as Telekom Malaysia, Digi, Axiata, Astro, Nestle and F&N."}, "443": {"date_posted": "30/4/2014", "title": "Sukuk: Khazanah said considering $1 billion exchangeable dollar sukuk", "article": " (Apr 30): Khazanah Nasional Bhd., Malaysia\\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, is considering selling as much as $1 billion of dollar-denominated exchangeable Islamic bonds, said four people with knowledge of the deal.

Telekom shares slumped 6% over five days after the March 27 announcement that essentially quashed hopes of more special dividend payments in the near term. In addition, start-up losses from the 57% stake in P1 would eat into earnings as Telekom moves into the space where three dominant mobile-phone operators are already finding it tough to grow, observers say.  Telekom\\u2019s group CEO Tan Sri Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa contests this view. \\u201cTM will never be No 4 in anything,\\u201d says a bemused Zamzamzairani on the notion of his company playing fourth fiddle to Malaysia\\u2019s \\u201cbig three\\u201d mobile operators: Maxis Bhd, DiGi.Com Bhd and its former unit Celcom Axiata Bhd.  \\u201cWe want to be No 1 in terms of providing converged services \\u2014 that\\u2019s very different [from TM playing catch-up with the big three]. People look at us as another mobile player but we are not [adding mobility in isolation]. We\\u2019re a converged player focused on giving the best experience to our customers,\\u201d he tells The Edge.  Telekom\\u2019s decision to add wireless mobility to its traditionally fixed line-centric portfolio may not be that different from a mobile-phone operator like Maxis offering its customers a wireline home phone and broadband to sell more services to existing customers. After all, consumers are increasingly accessing the Internet using mobile phones and tablets, thanks to high-speed Internet on-the-go.\\u201cProviding connectivity alone is not enough\\u2026 Looking at the changing behaviour of customers, if we only remain in that same space, we will get further and further away from the end-user. That\\u2019s why we need to move towards enhancing the user experience with content, devices and apps \\u2014 what we call the innovation exchange,\\u201d Zamzamzairani says, relating Telekom\\u2019s desire to offer an end-to-end suite of services to individuals as well as corporate and enterprise customers.  \\u201cIt\\u2019s about life made easier for our customers, business made easier for our corporate customers. That\\u2019s not just our tagline but how we must approach the market [to win and retain customers]. Technology is no longer a differential because anyone with money can buy technology, which is changing every day.\\u201d  The lack of a differential in quality of service means that users are likely to choose a service provider that gives the best value and customer experience, industry experts say.\\u00a0 This realisation has made it easier for telecoms operators to share network infrastructure \\u2014 something unheard of in the mid-2000s when network coverage strength was still used as a selling point to woo mobile-phone customers.  Similarly, Telekom is recouping its RM8.9 billion investment in its HSBB network faster by selling wholesale capacity to rivals. Old timers would remember the reluctance displayed by Telekom, in its old incarnation, towards \\u201cequal access\\u201d, which would allow rivals to piggyback\\u00a0 on \\u201cthe local loop\\u201d to provide the old-school fixed-line phone service.  While the government made Telekom promise to open the HSBB network to any local licensed provider when RM2.4 billion worth of public funds went into building Phase 1 of the RM11.3 billion HSBB network, some experts think it is Telekom\\u2019s control over this trunk wired fibre network that gives it an edge over the local mobile giants.  \\u201cIt is easier for the fixed-line player to move into mobile, not the other way around,\\u201d says a telecoms analyst, explaining how wireless network is relatively faster and cheaper to roll out.  Zamzamzairani admits as much: \\u201cBecause we are strong in [backhaul fixed line] infrastructure, we have greater control over the end-to-end experience.\\u201d While Telekom is open to more acquisitions to improve its service portfolio, he says the company is more likely to make \\u201copportunistic\\u201d purchases rather than actively seeking out targets.  \\u201cNo 1 doesn\\u2019t mean we have to own everything. We can fill gaps through collaborations like P1 or tie-ups with other players as well,\\u201d he says, adding that enterprise services and business process outsourcing (BPO) are among areas Telekom would like to further strengthen.  For now, the focus is to sort out details of the P1 collaboration, which gives Telekom the right to name the latter\\u2019s CEO. With access to P1\\u2019s 50MHz spectrum in the 2.3GHz and 2.6GHz bands for the 4G-Long Term Evolution (LTE) rollout, TM can make greater use of its spectrum in the lower 450MHz and 850MHz bands that have wider coverage capabilities versus the higher capacity to carry data in the higher bands.  \\u201cWhat TM needs now is permission to use the 850MHz spectrum nationwide, beyond the universal service provision (USP) coverage [in rural areas],\\u201d a telecoms analyst says, drawing comfort from the fact that the Malaysian government has hitherto chosen not to charge high spectrum fees to encourage wider rollout.  Zamzamzairani is convinced that Telekom can make a strong case to ask for continued usage of the 850MHz spectrum for nationwide LTE rollout when the spectrum is up for renewal next year. This would allow Telekom to also offer mobile-phone services, on top of wireless broadband.  The other big-ticket item is the outcome of negotiations on the government\\u2019s co-investment in Phase 2 of the HSBB network rollout announced in Budget 2014 last September. Zamzamzairani says it is premature to give any guidance on capital expenditure as negotiations are still ongoing but is \\u201chopeful\\u201d of concluding talks by year-end.  Instead, he points out the strength of Telekom\\u2019s balance sheet to meet the potential rise in capex needs as well as keep its promise to pay a minimum annual dividend of RM700 million.\\u00a0 \\u201cPeak funding was some RM2.7 billion in 2010, when capital needs for HSBB were at their peak\\u2026 We\\u2019re not a start-up. Today our revenues are much stronger\\u2026\\u00a0 We have said there is no change in our dividend policy and we have many other levers [to pull],\\u201d Zamzamzairani says when pressed for details.  \\u201cYou\\u2019re right that this [change in direction] is a chance to review [the dividend policy] but I can tell you that this is not being considered,\\u201d he adds.  Time will tell if the scenario will change should Telekom\\u2019s stake in P1 rise substantially.\\u00a0According to the terms of the planned RM210 million convertible bonds issuance by Green Packet Bhd, Telekom could end up taking over the latter\\u2019s entire 30% stake in the enlarged P1 if Green Packet defaults on the debt papers. This would raise TM\\u2019s stake from 57% to 87%, leaving South Korea\\u2019s leading LTE operator SK Telekom with a 13% stake. As it is, TM is taking up 60% or RM990 million of P1\\u2019s planned RM1.65 billion convertible bonds to raise cash for network rollout over the next three to five years. For now, Standard & Poor\\u2019s credit analyst Mehul Sukkawala says Telekom\\u2019s credit rating is unaffected by its investment in P1 and the LTE rollout, which is expected to raise debt-to-Ebitda levels to about two times over the next two to three years from 1.7 times in 2013. \\u201cEven then, the ratio is likely to remain significantly below our downgrade rating trigger of close to 2.5 times,\\u201d the analyst writes in an April 3 note. Analysts polled on Bloomberg seem split over TM\\u2019s stock performance for the coming 12 months, with eight \\u201cbuys\\u201d versus 12 \\u201cholds\\u201d and 10 \\u201csells\\u201d and price targets ranging from RM4.80 to RM7.22. Using its current share base, yield was 3.36% at last Thursday\\u2019s RM5.83 close, based on its minimum RM700 million, or 19.57 sen per share, dividend payout. That could limit upside for the stock, although analysts agree that strategic assets are rarely ever cheap. Asked on the naysayers, Zamzamzairani said many doubted the HSBB\\u2019s potential when the idea was mooted in 2008 \\u2014 the reason a minimum dividend was promised to reward investors who stuck on during the lower earnings and high expenditure days. \\u201cToday, HSBB take-up is greater than we thought. Who would have thought that after only three-plus years, take-up rate would be 43%?\\u201d  He, for one, has no doubt that Telekom has \\u201call the important pieces\\u201d of the puzzle to regain the dominance it once enjoyed. Does this mean it is a matter of time before Telekom\\u2019s stock moves back to Malaysia\\u2019s top three position \\u2014 just like in the early 2000 when the so-called TMT (Telekom-Maybank-Tenaga) stocks were the bluest of the Malaysian blue chips?  \\u201cWe\\u2019re not after the top market-cap position per se but it is more of providing customers with the best experience\\u2026 I would say that TM is in the best position to deliver an end-to-end service proposition as we have all the pertinent pieces to play with\\u2026 ARPUs [average revenue per user] are rising, so we must be doing something right.\\u201d This story first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly Edition, on April 7 - April 13, 2014."}, "449": {"date_posted": "14/4/2014", "title": "Interview: Telekom eyes No 1 top spot in converged world", "article": " SIX years after demerging its mobile operations into Axiata Group Bhd, the country\\u2019s fixed-line operator Telekom Malaysia Bhd see ms to be back-pedalling by acquiring control of niche fourth-generation (4G) mobile spectrum holder Packet One Networks (M) Sdn Bhd (P1).

The market had stayed in the negative territory for the entire day amid bearish sentiment, with decliners leading gainers by 424 to 389. \\u00a0 Choo Swee Kee, Chief Investment Officer at TA Investment Management Bhd, told theedgemalaysia.com that the local funds were neutral on the market today as there are no major catalysts on the horizon. \\u201cThere were some foreign funds coming into the Asia Pacific market, but not into Malaysia. One reason (for the fall) could be that on comparative valuation, Malaysia is considered a premium compared to regional markets,\\u201d Choo said. The top gainer today was Ecoworld, which saw a 43 sen gain. The top decliner was Dana Infra, which lost 99 sen. The most active stock was Symphony. In the region, most Asian markets rose to shrug off early losses. Reuters reported that the market had risen, helped by Chinese shares rising sharply on stimulus hopes, though Japanese equities slumped as the yen clung to its gains after the Bank of Japan held policy steady. The Kospi rose 0.17% to 1993.03 and the Hang Seng gained 0.98% to 22596.97.

Investor reaction was, however, tepid. Shares for Green Packet Bhd closed down 9.6% at 47 sen last Friday.  Recall that its share price surged as high as 64 sen in October on speculation of an imminent sale of its 55% stake in P1. Meanwhile, the share price for Telekom closed down 4.3% at RM5.93. The lukewarm reaction is understandable. Telekom will inject cash into P1 and recharge its expansion plans, which have slowed significantly over the past year. But that in itself is no guarantee of success in the very competitive telco sector. No cashing out for Green Packet Shareholders of Green Packet are likely disappointed that the much talked about sale values P1 at less than when a 25.8% stake was sold to SK Telecom for US$100 million (RM327 million) back in 2010. Telekom is now paying \\u201conly\\u201d RM350 million for a 57% equity stake in the WiMAX operator.  More importantly, Telekom\\u2019s 57% stake comes from the issuance of new shares by P1. This means that Green Packet does not get a share of the RM350 million proceeds but its stake will be diluted to 30% based on the enlarged share capital of P1.  Having said that, Green Packet will get some cash flow \\u2014 from the issuance of RM210 million worth of redeemable exchangeable bonds to Telekom. The first tranche for RM120 million should be issued later this year with the balance likely in 2015.  Save for some RM30 million that will be used to acquire P1 shares held by minority shareholders, the remaining proceeds can be utilised by Green Packet for settlement of liabilities and working capital. (Telekom can swap the bonds for Green Packet\\u2019s shares in P1 in five years\\u2019 time, if they are not redeemed.)  But given that Green Packet will also subscribe for 15% of the RM1.65 billion redeemable convertible bonds to be issued by P1 \\u2014 equivalent to roughly RM248 million \\u2014 over the next three years, it is unlikely there will be any special payout to shareholders from this whole exercise. This means that Green Packet shareholders will have to continue to be patient. Instead of cashing out, shareholders will have to wait for P1\\u2019s turnaround. In the meantime, the company will likely remain in the red with limited chance for dividends. We have previously mentioned that Green Packet may well want to retain a stake in P1 (article published Oct 16, 2013). The broadband business is its primary thrust going forward unless the company decides on a major strategic change. Its other businesses, the devices unit is very competitive and marginally loss-making while margins for the communications unit are wafer thin with limited prospects. But it is sorely in need of a game changer if it is to turn the company around. Getting Telekom onboard is potentially that game changer. Cash infusion to recharge P1\\u2019s expansion plans One of P1\\u2019s greatest obstacles was the limits of its balance sheet. Unlike deep-pocketed YTL Communications, which could afford a nationwide rollout, P1 has always been very cautious in expanding, adding sites and capacity only in lock-step with demand. We estimate total capital expenditure (capex) spent to date, since 2007, at just about RM1 billion. This rollout model works quite well for the home broadband business. Gradually expanding coverage in the later years allowed P1 to launch limited nomadic broadband services but its roughly 55%-60% coverage is too low to offer nationwide mobile broadband services.  To compete fully in the 4G mobile services market, P1 would need nationwide coverage \\u2014 at least 80% to compete with the likes of Maxis Bhd, Celcom Axiata Bhd and DiGi.Com Bhd. That means substantially more capex, which would be difficult without corresponding improvement in revenue and cash flow. P1 generated RM306 million revenue in 2013 with operating earnings (before depreciation, interest and tax) of just RM38 million and net loss of RM116 million. With Telekom in the picture, P1 is slated to raise RM2 billion in fresh capital \\u2014 RM1.65 billion in convertible bonds and RM350 million from new shares issued to Telekom \\u2014 to fund its LTE network rollout for the next three years. Telekom and SK Telecom will subscribe to 60% and 25% of the bonds while Green Packet will take up the remaining 15%.  Even so, there is no guarantee of P1\\u2019s turnaround. The LTE-space is extremely competitive and dominated by Maxis, Celcom and DiGi while smaller players like U Mobile and YTL Communications also jostle for a share of the already saturated market. And then, there is newcomer Altel Communications, which is owned by tycoon Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Al-Bukhary. P1 a risky bet for Telekom As such, the investment could be a risky one for Telekom. The company has been doing well, focusing on the home broadband market segment that is driven by good take up for its UniFi services. With this proposed acquisition, gearing will rise and earnings in the near to medium term will be hurt by higher interest expenses and consolidation of P1\\u2019s losses \\u2014 probably by between 10%-20% from current earnings estimates.  At the prevailing price, the stock is trading at roughly 22 times our estimated earnings for the current year with net yield of 4.4%. With flattish to slightly negative earnings growth likely for the next year or two, at least, Telekom\\u2019s valuations do not appear attractive. Whether the acquisition turns out to be value accretive depends on P1\\u2019s success over the longer term.

American markets fell on Wednesday night, led down by a softer technology sector (via weakness in King Digital Entertainment\\u2019s initial public offering and Facebook). The SP 500 index fell 13.06 points to close at 1,852.56 points while the Dow tumbled 98.89 points to end at 16,268.99 on Wednesday night. The FBM KLCI traded in a firmer range of 25.84 points for the week with higher volumes of 1.94 billion to 2.08 billion shares done. The index closed at 1,846.87 yesterday, up 7.73 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like Axiata Group Bhd, IOI Properties Group Bhd, Petronas Dagangan Bhd, RHB Capital Bhd and UMW Holdings Bhd caused the index to move up on late local first quarter of 2014 (1Q14) window dressing activities yesterday. The index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (May 2013) and it represents an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cFlat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cPseudo-Bull\\u201d rise completed. The price movements in the index in the next few months following May 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69 (high) and 1,802.88 (low). The index\\u2019s daily signals (like CCI, DMI, MACD, Stochastic and Oscillator) are all positive. As such, its firm support levels are seen at 1,802, 1,820 and 1,846, while the resistance areas of 1,849, 1,852 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some very heavy selling. Our rebound retracement target of 1,839.26 (62% level) had capped the index on March 6. However, the 1Q14 window dressing activities late this month have caused the index to break above that key level. Thus, we may visit upside targets of 1,871 and 1,882 in the\\u00a0 medium term yet again. Its simple moving averages (MA) depict an emerging uptrend for its daily, weekly and monthly charts. Due to its firmer chart signals, we believe investors will continue to adopt a \\u201cbuy on dips\\u201d philosophy for the KLCI. Due to the firmer tone for the KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Inari Amertron Bhd, which broke above the RM1 billion market capitalisation mark on March 7 after our weekly write-up in October 2013 when the market capitalisation was just about RM560 million. The strong rise in the stock can be attributed to investor optimism on its future earnings potential as well as the potential transfer to the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia. For 2Q ended Dec 31 of financial year 2014 (2QFY14), Inari\\u2019s profit before tax (PBT) improved significantly to RM26.6 million from RM11.3 million in 2QFY13. The improved profitability was attributed to the increase in revenue, strong US dollar and favourable gold prices during the period as well as consolidation of revenue and profit generated by the newly acquired Amertron Group. Going forward, Inari expects rising demand to contribute positively to its outlook, as demand for smartphones and tablet computers is expected to grow further in the near term. A check on Bloomberg consensus reveals that only one research house has coverage on the stock, with a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call. The stock is currently trading at a fair historical price-earnings ratio of 14.8 times but a high price-to-book value of 5.9 times. Inari has a fair indicative 12-month dividend yield of 2.29%. Inari\\u2019s chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames are very strong. Its share price made an obvious surge since its weekly Wave-2 low of 37 sen in March 2013. Since that 37 sen low, Inari surged to its recent March 2014 high of RM2.87. Its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to its recent March 2014 high of RM2.87. As it broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of RM2.31 and RM2.54, look to buy Inari on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to medium term uptrends for this stock. The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD and Oscillator) are very positive and now depict the obvious indications of Inari\\u2019s eventual move towards much higher levels. We expect Inari to remain very well sought after on dips towards its support levels of RM2.31, RM2.54 and RM2.78. It may attract minor profit taking at the resistance levels of RM2.85 and RM2.87. Its upside targets are now located at RM3.31, RM3.69, RM3.82 and RM4.51.

MyETF-MMID \\u201cis designed for investors looking to invest in a liquid financial instrument, with an index-tracking feature that focuses on high-dividend-yield, shariah-compliant companies listed on Bursa Malaysia,\\u201d says its prospectus. Put another way, the fund, which has an approved size of 500 million units, issued at RM1 each, is suitable for investors looking for a passive approach to investing in a basket of shariah-compliant equities. Unfamiliar to many, an ETF is an open-ended investment or unit trust fund, that is traded on a stock exchange. It essentially combines the features of an index fund and a stock, where trading liquidity is reflective of its underlying basket of stocks, bonds or commodities. To determine its exposure, investors will need to examine the underlying benchmark and the assets held by the ETF.  MyETF-MMID is a passively managed fund, which means, the manager aims to track the performance of the benchmark index \\u2014 the MSCI Malaysia IMI Islamic High Dividend Yield 10/40 Index \\u2014 rather than seeking to outperform it, which is done by an actively-managed fund that charges higher fees. The Islamic ETF will be managed by i-VCAP Management, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Valuecap Sdn Bhd. i-VCAP also manages MyETF-DJIM25, which was listed in early 2008, and reportedly plans to list at least two more ETFs this year.  For this ETF, the manager \\u201caims to achieve an absolute value of tracking error, of less than 3%, between the NAV (net asset value) of the fund and the benchmark index,\\u201d the prospectus says. The benchmark index is designed as a performance benchmark for the high-dividend-yield segment of its parent index, MSCI Malaysia IMI Islamic Index, and may consist of 16 to 30 shariah-compliant companies listed on Bursa Malaysia, with higher-than-average dividend yields, that are deemed both sustainable and persistent, by the MSCI. As at the last practicable date, the top 10 constituents of the benchmark index, which are reviewed and rebalanced semi-annually, with changes implemented at the close of the last business day in May and November, included DiGi.Com Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, Maxis Bhd, Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd, Hap Seng Plantations Holdings, Ta Ann Holdings Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd, UMW Holdings Bhd, WCT Holdings Bhd and Mah Sing Group Bhd.  As a general rule, the fund invests \\u201cat least 90%\\u201d of its assets in authorised securities, and keeps not more than 10% of its assets in liquid assets, or cash and cash equivalents.  The fund is not allowed to invest in derivatives, or to borrow cash. It may distribute to the unitholders, all or a substantial portion of its distributable income, prorated according to the number of units held by each unit holder, as at the entitlement date of the income distribution.  The ability of the fund to make distributions, depends principally on the dividends declared and paid by the companies, whose securities are held by the fund, and the level of fees and expenses payable by the fund. The manager has absolute discretion over the exact amount to be distributed, and income distribution, if any, is expected to be made annually. The annual management fee is set at 0.4% of the fund\\u2019s NAV per annum, while the annual trustee fee is 0.045% of NAV per annum, subject to a minimum of RM12,000. \\u201cInvestors should be aware that, by investing in the fund, there is no guarantee of any income distribution or returns. There is also no guarantee that investors will enjoy any capital appreciation, or will not experience any loss of capital invested in the fund,\\u201d the prospectus reads.  It adds: \\u201cFactors such as the fees and expenses incurred by the fund, imperfect correlation between the fund assets and the index securities, rounding of share prices, changes to the benchmark index and regulatory policies, may affect the manager\\u2019s ability to achieve close correlation with the performance of the benchmark index.\\u201d Investors who do not hold redemption unit blocks, currently set at 400,000, will only be able to realise the value of their units, by selling them on Bursa Malaysia at market price, which may deviate from the fund\\u2019s NAV.

TM\\u2019s performance was mainly due to a tax incentive while DiGi was fuelled by stronger uptake of its mobile Internet service and better cost efficiencies. Axiata Group Bhd\\u2019s short-term outlook remains challenging due to the integration costs of its Indonesian subsidiary, PT XL Axiata Tbk\\u2019s acquisition of PT Axis Telekom Indonesia, and continued currency fluctuations in all its key regional operations. Maxis Bhd, on the other hand, continued to be lacklustre, as expected, due to its ongoing business transformation plan. The telco sector\\u2019s price-earnings ratio (PER) has a strong correlation with dividend payout rather than the risk-free rate. Based on our consensus dividend payout and yield spread studies, the sector\\u2019s PER has a stronger correlation of 93% with the dividend payout in contrast to -58% correlation with the Malaysian government securities (MGS) 10-year yield. Our findings also showed that the sector\\u2019s PER is likely to be narrowed in financial year 2014 (FY14). Maxis\\u2019 FY14 PER is expected to be narrow while both Telekom and Axiata\\u2019s PER are likely to widen. DiGi\\u2019s PER direction in FY14 is seen to be mixed. As at end-FY13, the smartphone penetration rates for Maxis, Celcom Axiata Bhd and DiGi stood at 56%, 38% and 38.1% respectively, which suggest room for growth in the future. Competition in the fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) segment will likely ease following the review of its home segment by Maxis. We are maintaining our \\u201cneutral\\u201d call on the telecommunications sector. While the data segment remained the key focus for all the celcos, they are also likely focus on spurring smartphone penetration rate through entry-level smartphones as well as widening network coverage in FY14. Our 1QFY14 stock pick, TM, has advanced by 10.1% year-to-date (as at March 25, 2014), outperforming the sector (-0.1%) and KLCI (-1.0%) for the same period. In view of TM\\u2019s current share price which is trading above our target price, we have downgraded the stock to \\u201cmarket perform\\u201d from \\u201coutperform\\u201d. Despite the lower rating, TM (target price [TP]: RM6) remains our top pick for the sector due to: (i) its solid presence in the FTTH market; (ii) the milder competition in its wholesale and fixed-line segments; and (iii) it potentially bagging the second phase of the high speed broadband (HSBB) project, which could lead the company to use the prospective savings in capital expenditure (or government grant) to reward its shareholders. If we are to assume that TM bags the project, we estimate that the government grant could come in at 20% to 25% (or RM360 million to RM450 million, representing 10 sen to 12.6 sen per share), which is similar to the quantum the company received for Phase 1 of the HSBB project. DiGi\\u2019s stock rating has also been lowered to \\u201cmarket perform\\u201d after it advanced by 8.1% YTD and is now trading slightly above our TP of RM5.24.

Year-to-date, revenue was flat with data and value-added services (VAS) the fastest growing segments with double digit growth of 16% and 34% respectively, while voice and SMS declined by 7% and 4% respectively. Non-voice revenue contributed 54% (+4ppt year-on-year [y-o-y]) of XL\\u2019s total usage revenue. Financial year 2013 ended Dec 31 (FY13) earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) decreased 11% y-o-y while margin contracted from 46% to 41% largely due to, among others, the introduction of SMS interconnect. XL recorded 60.5 million subscribers or 32% increase year-on-year (y-o-y). Data and VAS experienced sustainable exponential growth increasing 142% y-o-y and reaching 54,615 terabyte per annum. Data subscribers reached 33 million or about half of the total subscriber base. Data has remained the fastest growing service in FY13 with its contribution to overall sales increasing from 20% to 23%. Catalysts for Axiata Group include higher smartphone penetration boosting data average revenue per user, strong growth in low penetration developing markets and more cost savings from collaboration with DiGi.Com Bhd.

This is in line with our expectations. Its 3Q13 plantation Ebit returned to the black with RM19.9 million in profit.  The heavy industries segment\\u2019s 3Q13 Ebit jumped 46% q-o-q to RM35 million, because of greater work progress for the second batch of littoral combat ships and maintenance, repair and overhaul-related activities. Boustead declared a single-tier interim dividend of 7.5 sen, taking the YTD dividend per share to 22.5 sen. Boustead has proposed to privatise its 53.6%-owned Al-Hadharah Boustead REIT, at RM2.10 apiece. This is a precursor to the eventual listing of the enlarged plantation business. Including B-REIT\\u2019s 19,900ha of plantation land, the company will own a total of 81,300ha. This does not include the 2,409ha it bought in Lahad Datu recently.  We tweaked the FY14F and FY15F earnings by 1%, after revising our crude palm oil price assumptions. We recommend holding the stock for dividend yields of 5% to 6%. Sunway Bhd Target price: RM3.05BUY AMRESEARCH (Dec 2): We upgrade Sunway to a \\u201cbuy\\u201d with an unchanged fair value of RM3.05 per share, based on a 10% discount to an SOP value of RM3.38 per share. Sunway on Dec 6, 2013, announced a 9MFY13 core net profit of RM325.4 million. However, 9MFY13\\u2019s effective tax rate was at only 17%, vis-\\u00e0-vis our projected corporate rate of 25%. Hence, we deem the result to be within expectations. For 9MFY13, property development contributed significantly to the earnings improvement, as the division\\u2019s revenue and estimated Ebit surged 43% and 33% respectively, with high billings from developments in Sunway South Quay, Sunway Velocity and Sunway Nexis. As at Sept 30, 2013, unbilled sales stood at RM2.2 billion, compared with RM2.41 billion a year earlier. Launches as at November 2013, totalled RM1.7 billion. Construction also boosted the group\\u2019s performance, as the division\\u2019s revenue and estimated Ebit rose 29% and 35% respectively. As at November 2013, construction order book replenishment totalled about RM2 billion, including internal works. Tenaga Nasional Bhd Target price: RM11.90BUY RHB RESEARCH INSTITUTE (Dec 3): Energy, Green Technology and Water Minister, Datuk Seri Dr Maximus Ongkili, has announced that electricity rates in Malaysia, excluding Sarawak, will go up by an average 14.9% to 38.5 sen per kWh, effective from Jan 1, 2014. Correspondingly, natural gas prices for power generation will be raised to RM15.20 per million British thermal unit (mmbtu), for the first 1,000 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd), from RM13.70, while the remaining 200 to 300 mmscfd of imported liquefied natural gas, will be supplied at a fixed price of RM41.68 per mmbtu. The tariff revision will be a boon for TNB, as this may potentially mark the commencement of the much-anticipated fuel costs pass-through mechanism, that will allow the company to pass on the fluctuations in fuel costs, to the end-consumer. We lift our core earnings forecasts for FY14 and FY15 marginally higher, by 1.5% and 3.2% respectively. Given that positive reforms are materialising, we peg a revised FY14 P/E multiple, at 15.4 times. Maintain \\u201cbuy\\u201d recommendation.  Berjaya Sports Toto BhdTarget price: RM4.54OUTPERFORM PUBLIC INVEST RESEARCH (Dec 3):\\u00a0 Berjaya Sports Toto announced that it has aborted its proposed listing of STM-Trust on the Singapore Exchange, due to the \\u201ccurrent challenging market conditions\\u201d and the poor performance of listed yield stocks, such as REITs and other business trusts in Singapore. We have always been apprehensive of the proposal, deeming the risk of capital loss to investors holding STM-Trust units being higher than the gains from the special dividend, and 8% yield promised from the listing of STM-Trust. Most business trusts in Singapore have performed poorly post-listing, with average returns of -29% from IPO prices, despite relatively high yields. With the cancellation, it is back to square one for BToto. Therefore, we revert our valuation method to the dividend discount model, and adjust our target price from RM4.42 to RM4.54. We also upgrade our call to \\u201coutperform\\u201d. BToto\\u2019s share price has declined 10% since the beginning of 2013, and with the overhang of the proposed listing removed, we believe the stock will rebound, supported by its strong dividend yield.  Supermax Corp Bhd Target price: RM3.50BUY TA SECURITIES RESEARCH (Dec 4): Glove City\\u2019s development will run concurrently with the proposed Supermax Business Park. In November 2013, the group acquired 100 acres of industrial land in Serendah, for RM78.4 million.  An integrated glove-manufacturing complex will be built on 60% of the land. The complex, to be developed in two phases over nine years, will have a capacity of 15.5 billion pieces per annum. Management does not expect any shortage of natural rubber and nitrile butadiene rubber, in the foreseeable future. In view of the hike in electricity rates in 2014, management anticipates higher cost of RM3.5 million in FY14, which translate into 2.5% of earnings. We impute the new FY13, FY14 and FY15 total installed capacity of 17.8 billion, 23.1 billion and 29.9 billion pieces per annum, respectively. Hence, we raise our FY15 earnings estimate by 6.2%, to RM189.2 million. We continue to like the stock for its undemanding valuation, versus its peers. Inari Amertron BhdTarget price: RM2.18BUY AFFIN INVESTMENT RESEARCH (Dec 4): Our FY14-FY16 EPS forecasts are raised by 17.3%, 38.8% and 35.4% respectively, to reflect our more upbeat outlook on the company\\u2019s performance, after our recent meeting with management. Earnings momentum should continue, supported by a planned 50% capacity expansion to cater for the roll-out of its test and measurement equipment, which are outsourced by Agilent, and an increase in the output of its bread-and-butter radio frequency (RF) products for Avago. We believe that the strong growth underpinning Inari Tech\\u2019s RF division, is the rising rate of long-term evolution (LTE) adoption, which is a natural progression of 3G. According to independent reports, global LTE subscription will hit two billion within the next five years, sealing Inari\\u2019s prospects in this fast-growth, high-demand area. We continue to like Inari, as it is involved in the smartphone and tablet business, which will fuel its earnings growth, at least over the near term. Glomac BhdTarget price: RM1.26HOLD TA SECURITIES (Dec 4): Glomac\\u2019s 1HFY14 core net profit came in within expectations, accounting for 48% of our full-year estimates. Sales during the period stood at RM265 million, a contraction of 31% from the previous year. The absence of new launches was the cause of the decline. The group\\u2019s unbilled sales remained stable at RM858 million, as at October 2013, versus RM852 million a quarter ago.  Following the announcement of cooling measures under Budget 2014, management expects some short-term consolidation in the market, as consumers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, Glomac has decided to re-strategise its FY14 launches, to focus on landed residential products, which are least impacted, and hold back the launch of commercial properties. Hence, FY14 launch estimates have been revised downwards to RM1 billion, from RM1.3 billion previously. We tweak our discounted cash flow-base revised net asset value per share estimate, to RM1.26 per share, from RM1.45 previously. Given an upside potential of 14.5%, we downgrade Glomac to \\u201chold\\u201d from \\u201cbuy\\u201d.Matrix Concepts Holdings BhdTarget price: RM4.80OUTPERFORM KENANGA RESEARCH (Dec 3): \\u201cOutperform\\u201d recommendation and target price of RM4.80, based on a 20% discount on its revised net asset value of RM6 per share. We like the stock on account of developments in Seremban, Negeri Sembilan, and Kluang, Johor, which enjoy growing demand. It is also reaping higher margins, because of low land costs.  After netting off dividends and expected acquisitions, the group has an estimated RM110 million for land purchases. Assuming that land cost is 10% to 15% of gross development value (GDV) and a net gearing limit of 0.3 times, the group can replenish up to RM800 million to RM1.1 billion worth of GDV, from FY14E onwards. For FY13, we believe that the total dividend payout will be 60% (due to the exceptional dividends arising from FY12), which implies a net yield of 9.4%. We expect FY14E dividend payout of 45%, which implies a yield of 7.8%. Valuations are also attractive, since Matrix is trading at 6.6 times and 5.8 times FY13E and FY14E PERs, respectively. Bumi Armada BhdTarget price: RM4.40BUY MAYBANK IB RESEARCH (Dec 4): Bumi Armada continues to benefit from Lukoil. It has secured long-term charters for three new offshore support vessels (OSVs) worth US$500 million (RM1.59 billion), commencing 2014. This is positive for earnings and complements its presence in Filanovsky, Russia.  Meanwhile, the letter of award for the Kraken floating production, storage and offloading vessel, is slightly delayed, but should be made known in a fortnight.  These OSV contracts are for 10 years (US$262 million), with the option to extend for another 10 years (US$221 million). The vessels are scheduled to begin work in November 2015. Pending delivery of these vessels, Bumi Armada has secured an interim contract worth US$18 million, to provide two support vessels and one rescue vessel for one year of work, commencing November 2014. We estimate that these Ice-Class OSVs will generate a revenue of US$26.2 million, and an Ebit of US$5.2 billion to US$6.6 million (20% to 25% margin) annually. \\u00a0 Perdana Petroleum BhdTarget price: RM1.70OUTPERFORM KENANGA RESEARCH (Dec 4): Perdana\\u2019s bonus share issue went ex on Dec 3, 2013, increasing its share base by 40% to 727.2 million. Perdana had announced in August 2013, a 2-for-5 bonus issue. We are positive about the bonus issue, as it will enhance trading liquidity of the stock. Medium-to-long-term prospects are stable, on the back of Perdana\\u2019s long-term contracts. For its existing vessels, at least 10 are chartered until 2018-2019, and three are until 2014-2015. Only four vessels \\u2014 one accommodation barge and three anchor handling tug supply vessels \\u2014 are on spot charters, which Perdana is confident of securing recurring contracts. The enlarged share base reduces our target price to RM1.70 (versus RM2.50), based on an unchanged target price earnings of 14 times (in line with its two-year historical average forward earnings ratio of 14 times, seen in 2007-2008), on its CY14 earnings per share of 14.6 sen. As there is still a 19% upside, we are keeping our target \\u201coutperform\\u201d call on the stock.Axiata Group BhdTarget price: RM7.20HOLD MAYBANK IB RESEARCH (Dec 3): Indonesia\\u2019s Ministry of Communication and Informatics has approved XL\\u2019s proposed acquisition of Axis.  Axiata\\u2019s Indonesian subsidiary XL will be allowed to keep Axis\\u2019 entire 1,800MHz spectrum (15MHz), hence achieving its aim of the acquisition. Nevertheless, we expect a relatively muted impact on Axiata\\u2019s share price, given the diminished significance of XL\\u2019s share price in recent times. Recall the rationale of the deal was purely for spectrum, and a key risk was the ministry ordering the partial or full return of spectrum. XL will be required to return Axis\\u2019 entire 2,100MHz spectrum (10MHz).  XL was initially expecting to retain 5MHz in this band. Nevertheless, XL is already well-endowed in this band and in our view, management is unlikely to lose sleep, over this. After completion of the deal, the merged entity will have 45MHz of spectrum.At present, Axis is loss-making (at the Ebitda level) and hence, the merger will be earnings dilutive to XL, in the near term.  Kossan Rubber Industries BhdTarget price: RM4.29BUY ALLIANCE RESEARCH (Dec 3): Kossan announced that it is acquiring 9.26 acres of freehold industrial land in Mukim Kapar, for RM19.37 million. We are positive about this move over the long term, as it is in line with the group\\u2019s strategy to replenish its landbank, to cater for capacity expansion.  We understand that the land is strategically located near to its factories in Klang, and is well-connected with the infrastructure for glove manufacturing, including natural gas supply.  We believe that this site will only be developed in 2015, with a target production capacity of six billion pieces of gloves per annum. This translates into a 30% additional capacity, from the estimated production capacity of 20 billion pieces per annum as at end-2014.  Kossan\\u2019s balance sheet remained healthy, with a net gearing of just 12.6% as at September 2013. We reiterate our \\u201cstrong buy\\u201d call on Kossan, with an unchanged target price of RM4.29, based on 16 times FY14 P/E. This implies 16.5% capital upside, with a FY14 net dividend yield of 4.1%.

Regional bond risks rose as China\\u2019s inflation eased and producer prices extended declines, adding to the signs that the economy is weakening. The US dollar climbed before the jobs data was due last night.  Expectation that the initial jobless claims would fall caused the American markets to ease off on Wednesday night. The SP500 lost 0.27 points to close at 1,837.61 points whilst the Dow fell 68.2 points to end at 16,462.74. The FBM KLCI traded in a sideways range of 15.4 points for the week with volumes of 1.6 billion to 1.96 billion shares done. The index closed at 1,828.21 yesterday, down 3.09 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like IOI Corp Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, CIMB Bank Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd caused the index to decline on profit taking activities yesterday. The index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (May 2013) and it represented an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cFlat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cPseudo-Bull\\u201d rise completed. The index price movements in the next few months following May 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low) and 1,882.2 (high). The index\\u2019s daily signals are mixed. The CCI and MACD are negative while the DMI, Oscillator and Stochastic are positive. As such, the index\\u2019s obvious support levels are seen at the 1,780, 1,800 and 1,822 levels, whilst the resistance areas of 1,828, 1,849 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some heavy profit-taking activities. Our upside targets of 1,898, 1,900 and 1,924 for the index in the medium term may be deferred for now. Its simple moving averages (MA) depict a double time frame (weekly and monthly) uptrend for now. Its daily chart has turned into a neutral position in January 2014. Due to its mixed signals, we believe investors may adopt a \\u201crange trading\\u201d philosophy as the KLCI remains at fairly lofty levels with bearish divergent signals. As such, profit-taking on index components as well as small to mid caps may persist into the next fortnight. Despite the lofty tone of the KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201cbuy\\u201d on MKH Bhd, which is a RM1.1 billion market cap company with a return on equity of 12% based on its 12-month trailing earnings. The stock made a new recent high of RM3.27 in tandem with the improving sentiment of the small and mid cap property stocks. It seems that the recent recurring theme from the property segment is the asset revaluation approach, where investors favour property companies with strategic landbank with development potential.  The firm rise in the stock price can be attributed to investors\\u2019 optimism on its strong earnings trend led by the plantation and property and construction division. For the fourth quarter of financial year 2013 ended Sept 30, MKH\\u2019s group revenue rose 21%. The rise was attributed to its plantation division\\u2019s higher sales of crude palm oil and palm kernel, as well as the property and construction division\\u2019s revenue from ongoing and new developments. Despite the better profitability, profit before tax was lower due to an inclusion of foreign exchange losses in the current quarter totalling RM63 million due to a weakening rupiah and ringgit against the US dollar. Maybank-IB does not have fundamental coverage on MKH. A check on Bloomberg consensus revealed that three brokers have coverage on the stock, with all having a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the stock.  The stock is currently trading at a reasonable historical price-earnings ratio of 10 times and a price-to-book value of 1.2 times. MKH\\u2019s indicated dividend yield is at 3.14%. Its chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly timeframes are very strong indeed. Its share price made an obvious surge since its monthly Wave-2 low of 57 sen in October 2008. Since that 57 sen low, MKH surged to its recent January 2014 high of RM3.27.  Its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to the recent high of RM3.27. As it broke above its recent key critical resistances of RM2.62 and RM2.85, look to buy MKH on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to long term uptrends for this stock.  The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD and Oscillator) are very strong and now depict the obvious indications of MKH\\u2019s eventual surge to higher levels. We expect MKH to remain very firm towards its support levels of RM2.62, RM2.85 and RM3.10.  It will attract minor profit taking at the resistance levels of RM3.27, RM3.58 and RM4.13. Its upside targets are now located at RM3.45, RM3.76, RM4.09 and RM4.22.

Nevertheless, downside is likely limited, a consequence of the trapped domestic liquidity. We see pockets of trading opportunity given the potential crystallisation of stock-specific catalysts in 2014. The possibility of a price war heading into 2014 cannot be entirely dismissed, particularly after the management restructuring at Maxis Bhd. Nevertheless, the new chief executive officer\\u2019s statement that Maxis will not compete on pricing was a welcome relief. We thus expect competition among the cellular majors to remain rational in the next 12 months. This will allow the companies to continue to focus on further monetising data. The growth in data usage is both explosive and secular, driven by: (i) increased users; (ii) faster Internet access; and (iii) improved content. For fixed-line players, we continue to expect growth in data revenue to more than offset falling voice revenue. With Maxis re-evaluating its integrated model, the competitive intensity in the fibre broadband segment could potentially decline. Within the next 12 months, DiGi.Com Bhd will announce its decision on whether to pursue a business trust (to overcome its dividend payout constraints). Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) could potentially receive a government grant for the rollout of Phase 2 of its high speed broadband service, while Axiata Group Bhd is working on a potentially value creating tower spin-off. In the longer term, Time dotCom Bhd (TDC) could once again unload its remaining DiGi shares. Maxis meanwhile could demonstrate signs of a turnaround. Our only \\u201cbuy\\u201d in the sector is TDC (target price [TP]: RM4.40), as it is most exposed to the secular growth trends of data, and has capital management potential. Among the big caps, our relative preference is TM (\\u201chold\\u201d, TP: RM5.50) and DiGi (\\u201chold\\u201d, TP: RM4.95) given their underperformance in 2013 and the emergence of potential rerating catalysts in the near term. \\u2014 Maybank IB Research, Jan 3 This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on January\\u00a006, 2014."}}
