Affin Hwang wrote in a note today it initiated coverage on Petronas Dagangan with a \"Hold\" rating and a target price of RM29. \"Petronas Dagangan, the marketing arm of national-owned Petronas is a well-established brand. \"It runs over a thousand petrol stations by a name known to many. We like Petronas Dagangan's business model due to its high barriers to entry, established branding and more importantly it operates a cash-cow business,\" Affin Hwang said. At 12.30pm, Petronas Dagangan shares settled at RM26.76 with 253,500 shares traded."}, "1": {"date_posted": "5/9/2018", "title": "Does the rally of Petronas-linked counters still have legs? ", "article": " THE FBM KLCI breached the psychologically critical level of 1,800 points last week. The benchmark index has risen nearly 9% from this year\\u2019s low of 1,663.9 on July 6 and has been on an upward trend since the start of the second half of the year. The climb of three Petronas-linked counters \\u2014 Petronas Dagangan Bhd (PetDag), Petronas Chemicals Bhd (PetChem) and Petronas Gas Bhd (PetGas) \\u2014 has added fuel to the rally. Since July, PetDag has risen 8.5%, PetChem 11.3% and PetGas 9.4%. And analysts who track the stocks believe there is room for the three to go even higher. MIDF Research analyst Aaron Tan says the run-up in the share prices of these companies has been supported by the generally improved sentiment on the local market. Tan says there is no direct relationship between oil prices \\u2014 Brent crude was trading at US$74.48 per barrel as of Aug 25, up 12% year to date \\u2014 but the continued climb of crude oil prices is helping to boost sentiment in oil and gas counters on Bursa Malaysia. However, these factors are not the only impetus for these counters, as each company has its own drivers as well. PetDag, which operates the country\\u2019s largest petrol station chain, reported a 28% year-on-year increase in net profit to RM314.42 million for the second financial quarter ended June 30 (2QFY2018), while revenue grew 10% to RM7.28 billion. Earnings from its retail segment \\u2014 the petrol stations \\u2014 were boosted by the 5% increase in average selling prices (ASPs), an increasing Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS) price trend and lower product and freight costs, which contributed to higher margins. Its commercial segment was also helped by higher ASPs, although sales volume fell 1% due to lower demand for Jet A1 amid the usage of fuel-efficient aircraft and refuelling optimisation initiatives by the airlines. Kenanga Investment Bank analyst Teh Kian Yeong says the results mark a strong rebound after the sharp decline in the preceding quarter, amid higher costs and lower sales volume. Despite the latest strong set of results, Teh says there is not much upside to PetDag\\u2019s share price, in view of the 13.5% gain since the start of the year. \\u201cWe maintain our view that most positives have been priced in following its share price run-up YTD as earnings growth potential is rather unexciting,\\u201d he says. MIDF\\u2019s Tan begs to differ. He believes that there is still room for the counter to rise, at least in the near term. \\u201cI am sure there is still headroom for PetDag\\u2019s share price to climb. At the end of the day, I think investors would not mind paying a premium for a counter they are comfortable with,\\u201d says Tan. However, there is concern over falling sales volume \\u2014 an unsurprising outcome as vehicles become more fuel efficient \\u2014 although Tan says management has effectively reduced costs through upgrading the IT infrastructure and inventory optimisation to preserve margins. PetChem\\u2019s share price, meanwhile, has been heading north, hitting a record high of RM9.44 on Aug 25, thanks to wider margins and the sale of its 50% stake in PRPC Polymers to Saudi Aramco, which was completed in March this year. YTD, the counter has gained more than 20%, closing at RM9.35 last Thursday. For 2QFY18, the group posted a 42% jump in net profit to RM1.37 billion compared with the previous corresponding quarter. Quarterly revenue grew 20% y-o-y to RM4.73 billion. Affin Hwang Capital analyst Tan Jianyuan says the better-than-expected performance was due mainly to higher overall product ASPs and improved plant utilisation in the fertiliser and methanol division as a result of lower maintenance activities at the ammonia and urea plants. \\u201cDespite the share price having already appreciated by 21% YTD, we believe PetChem will see more upside as it benefits from favourable product spreads, which will help to partly offset the anticipated weaker 2H plant utilisation,\\u201d he writes in a recent note. The research house has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the stock with a target price of RM10. An analyst who declines to be named says PetChem\\u2019s sale of its 50% stake in PRPC Polymers was one of the main drivers of the increase in the share price. \\u201cThere are reports speculating that it might pay out a special dividend following the sale of the stake. But, in our base case scenario, we did not price in any potential special dividend, although its cash pile will be bigger,\\u201d he says. The analyst expects the group\\u2019s margins to be sustained until year end, supported by growing Chinese demand for methanol products, which is expected to improve margins from the second half onwards. \\u201cThere will be some major maintenance works in the third and fourth quarters but PetChem is doing it in phases so I don\\u2019t think it will affect its earnings significantly. Moreover, the group will benefit from the strengthening of the US dollar against the ringgit as well, because its sales are denominated in the US dollar,\\u201d he adds. On the other hand, the outlook for PetGas is not as positive as the two other Petronas units, in view of the expected erosion from the Energy Commission\\u2019s (EC) plan to implement incentive-based regulation (IBR) tariffs from January next year. Although its 2QFY2018 results were in line with expectations \\u2014 20% y-o-y increase in net profit to RM509.33 million \\u2014 AmInvestment Bank analyst Alex Goh maintains a \\u201csell\\u201d call on the stock, with a fair value of RM17.50, due to the implementation of the IBR tariffs. Goh highlights that the stock currently trades at a price-earnings ratio of 19 times, which is 17% below its two-year average with a \\u201cfair\\u201d dividend yield of 4%, but says these valuations may not be justified. \\u201cThese valuations are unjustified given that its recurring income and margins are likely to erode over the longer term due to the implementation of IBR, even though management hopes to cushion the impact of the lower tariffs over an undisclosed duration, which is currently under negotiation with the EC,\\u201d he says. Affin Hwang Capital Research has also downgraded its call on the stock to \\u201chold\\u201d from \\u201cbuy\\u201d, following the 2QFY2018 results, as the counter approaches its target price of RM20.10 with limited near-term catalysts. \\u00a0 \\u00a0"}, "2": {"date_posted": "30/8/2018", "title": "Cover Story: Wishes for Merdeka", "article": " It has been an eventful year so far. For many Malaysians, the surprise victory of Pakatan Harapan, led by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, in the 14th general election has ushered in a new era of hope. In conjunction with the country\\u2019s 61st Independence Day celebrations, we asked property experts and industry players three questions: What is your wish for Malaysia Baru? What are the three most important issues facing the property industry? Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why? Read on for their replies. See Kok Loong\nDirector, Metro Homes Sdn Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nMy wish is that the new government will focus on safety, education and healthcare. We need concrete steps to reduce crime and make Malaysia one of the safest countries to live in. We need to ensure that the standard of public education is close to the world standard so the next generation can help the country progress further. There is also a need put aside politics in education and focus on ensuring that all Malaysians get high quality education. The government should also ensure high-quality healthcare for all citizens. The first parliamentary session assured us that institutional reforms will be carried out. I hope the leaders are prudent in ensuring that we have a good balance of development progress and reduction of government debt. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nAffordable housing is the most important issue currently. There is a need to ensure that every eligible Malaysian can afford to buy a home. The government should have proper planning for each development to make sure there is real demand so that there will be no mismatch. Oversupply might be disastrous for the economy. The government should also ensure proper enforcement so as to avoid having abandoned projects. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nKL Railway Station and Railway Administration Building are my favourite buildings. The former was built in 1910 and the latter, 1917, by British colonial architects. Both are well maintained. I still remember taking the train to Singapore from here in the 1980s. The KL Railway Station has witnessed the progress of KL. Although most people take public transport at KL Sentral now, the old station remains a beautiful piece of history and architecture. \\u00a0 Eddy Wong\nManaging director, Nawawi Tie Leung What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nWith the change in government, we are starting a new chapter, full of hope and anticipation.\nI wish for the country to be united as one, where we are all Malaysians, regardless of race, language or religion. Where we can live in harmony without fear or favour, where the rule of law applies equally to everyone. Where good governance is not a privilege but is to be expected from our leaders, and meritocracy is our guiding principle for decisions and policies.\nWe need to be relevant and competitive in the global arena. This is the only way to ensure an exciting and prosperous future for each and every one of us. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nAffordable housing, high household debt and the oversupply situation in the residential, office and retail market sectors. To resolve the affordable housing issue, we must not only look at the supply and the facilitation of the development of affordable homes, but also the demand by raising the income levels of the population. In order to raise income levels, we must review the quality of education in the country. Education should not be politicised; only by equipping the population with the right skills and knowledge through education, and with improved productivity, can we raise income levels and achieve the home ownership dreams of our rakyat. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nI grew up in Johor Baru and one historic building that stands out is Bangunan Sultan Ibrahim on Bukit Timbalan. The former State Secretariat building\\u2019s design and architecture reflects a combination of Johor Malay, Islamic and colonial influences, which not only gives it its uniqueness but also a majestic aura. It is certainly an iconic landmark in Johor Baru. \\u00a0 James Wong\nDirector, VPC Alliance (KL) Sdn Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nI would like the government to come up with a national housing policy so that every person will have a home, an integrated and affordable public transport system for every city and major town and a greener environment with the planting of more trees, reducing the use of plastic and cutting pollution. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nWe need to build more affordable housing to cater for demand, address the mismatch between supply, demand, location and property pricing by increasing supply in the right property sectors and building more homes in areas where there is demand. We also should reduce property prices by having clearer planning guidelines, reducing red tape and implementing the Industrialised Building System. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nKellie\\u2019s Castle in Batu Gajah, Perak, stands out for me. Built in 1915, the six-storey English castle with Scottish, Moorish and Indian architecture was to have a lift and a basement cellar. Scottish planter William Kellie Smith built the castle to persuade his wife, Agnes, to live in Malaya but unfortunately, he died before he could finish it, in 1926. \\u00a0 Lim Poh Yit\nDeputy group managing director, Titijaya Land Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nI wish for a government that places importance on its people. Racial harmony and high religious tolerance should be a priority moving forward. Only then can the country progress and make an impact on the world stage. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThe loan rejection rate is currently very high, so, many people cannot afford to purchase a property of their own. The gap between affordable homes and buyers\\u2019 expectations is also an issue; low-cost housing should not necessarily compromise on quality. Lastly, the process of buying homes is too tedious \\u2014 a qualified buyer has to deal with various agencies. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nPanggung Bandaraya DBKL in Kuala Lumpur. Besides its beautiful architecture, it also plays a significant role in promoting Malaysia\\u2019s performing arts and culture industry. These historic buildings need to be preserved for their long and rich cultural heritage. \\u00a0 Sarena Cheah\nManaging director, property division, Sunway Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nMy wish is for all of us to do our part, learning from our past successes and failures, in starting a new chapter to strengthen our country\\u2019s foundation for a more progressive and sustainable future. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThere is a need for all stakeholders to work together to develop a holistic and coherent strategy in addressing the mismatch between the demand and supply of homes for all Malaysians.\nIt is also crucial that we have a clear plan to improve the country\\u2019s overall productivity and income growth to support a more robust market economy while working on initiatives to help all Malaysians own their first home. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nThe Sultan Abdul Samad Building, which faces Merdeka Square, is a prominent landmark where the nation declared its independence on Aug 31, 1957. It continues to be a popular destination for all Malaysians and serves as a beautiful reminder of the past and brings people of different ethnicities together for one unified purpose. \\u00a0 Samuel Tan\nExecutive director, KGV International Property Consultants (Johor) Sdn Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nI wish for Malaysians to live harmoniously. Each person should be given an equal opportunity to prosper in this nation. Policies implemented must benefit the people. Corruption must be erased and the culprits must be caught and punished. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThe three pressing issues are oversupply, affordability and balanced development. Oversupply of certain property types causes an imbalance in the ecosystem, which is unhealthy. Affordability is the availability of houses that are within the purchasing power of buyers. Increasingly, houses are getting out of reach of the average man on the street. Balanced development means ensuring growth is spread to other areas apart from the growth corridors. There will be opportunities for all to enjoy the fruits of economic growth. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nIn Johor, Bangunan Bukit Timbalan is an outstanding historic building that embraces the rich past of the state. It was used as the State Administrative Centre as well as the command centre during the Japanese occupation. It is a very visible landmark that can be seen from Singapore and its unique design showcases the rich Johor architecture. \\u00a0 Sarkunan Subramaniam\nManaging director, Knight Frank Malaysia What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nMy wish is for Malaysia to be a harmonious and racially tolerant country that practises transparency and accountability. Moving forward, politicians should argue with merit. Also, I wish May 9 could be declared Liberation Day because we were truly liberated by people power. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nFirst is housing affordability. Owning a house gives people a greater sense of security. Second, improving the country\\u2019s economy. This can be done by bringing foreign investors into the high-end residential and big-ticket investment markets. Lastly, cutting red tape in land development and reducing compliance costs. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nBok House in Jalan Ampang, Kuala Lumpur. The building is gone but it is vividly clear in my memory. It was a beautiful building that featured classical European architecture. Also, the widely believed love story behind this mansion amazes me. \\u00a0 Datuk Ewe Swee Kheng\nDeputy executive chairman & group managing director, Ewein Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nIt is uplifting to see that the new government has brought the people so much hope and spirit. I hope that it will deliver on its promises and create new policies that can improve the property market. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nSlow income growth versus demand for affordable housing has been an issue for many years now. Despite more developers venturing into the affordable housing segment, many of the new generation of buyers are still adopting a wait-and-see approach. The term \\u2018affordable housing\\u2019 also needs to be looked into more deeply and redefined, if necessary. As so many of the houses in this category are being introduced and marketed, it may create unrealistic expectations among consumers, which leads to lower buying interest as well as higher loan rejection rates. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nWithout a doubt, Fort Cornwallis on Penang Island is my favourite. It has a long and interesting history. Built in 1786, the fort has never been engaged in combat and has now become a prime tourist attraction. \\u00a0 Datuk Christopher Boyd\nExecutive chairman, Savills Malaysia What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nMalaysia needs much more job-generating investment. Nothwithstanding the change in government, potential investors, both domestic and foreign, need to feel confident that Malaysia is embarking on a long period of political stability. That is my wish for Malaysia Baru. Stability, investment (particularly foreign direct investment) and prosperity. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nMalaysia has no major property problems. Oversupply in some sectors will right itself in time. However, I would like to see: \\u00a0Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nMy favourite historic place is Merdeka Square. Overlooked by Bukit Aman and bounded by the Sultan Abdul Samad Building, the Royal Selangor Club, St Mary\\u2019s Cathedral and what was once one of Malaysia\\u2019s earlier banks, it is a living history book. It tells the story of the city\\u2019s colonial rule, hardship, floods, fires, wars and eventual independence and prosperity. \\u00a0 Ngan Chee Meng\nCEO and managing director, Gamuda Land What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nAn inclusive Malaysia and a transparent and effective government. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThe government\\u2019s role in rolling out affordable homes, as property affordability is largely associated with social inequality. Better connectivity so that developments can expand into suburbs and people can still commute to the city with ease. A good transport infrastructure will reduce the cost of living for people who choose to live in the suburbs instead of the city. Everyone deserves equal access to a greener living environment and the government should promote this for all development projects. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nTo me, it will always be the Sultan Abdul Samad Building opposite Dataran Merdeka. It is an iconic and beautiful heritage landmark that all Malaysians can relate to. \\u00a0 Previndran Singhe\nCEO, Zerin Properties What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nA Malaysia for all Malaysians. An improved education system, talented Malaysians who are nurtured to reach new heights, good morals. Respect for one another, humility and kindness to be the pillars of future generations. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThe property industry has the normal issues experienced in those of other countries. We hope Malaysia Baru can pave the way for a sustainable property industry, with a strong focus on the rakyat. This, plus proper structure and local plans, will give a quality lifestyle to all Malaysians. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nThe 121-year-old Bangunan Sultan Abdul Samad! Its sheer Indo-Saracenic beauty, its history and its location at the confluence of the Gombak and Klang rivers truly take you back to the pre-independence era. It was at one time the biggest building in Malaya. The country was governed from here! \\u00a0 Billy Ong\nGroup managing director, OCR Group Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nI hope Malaysia will move forward from the old chapter and start building a stronger Malaysia Baru to improve living standards and shine again in the region. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThey are affordability, supply of affordable housing and economic uncertainties. The development costs, which include land, construction and compliance, have increased tremendously over the years. This has been the main hurdle for developers to price their products competitively. The affordability gap has become wider as income growth has slowed. Over the years, there have been good efforts on the part of certain government agencies to increase the supply of affordable housing. However, more effort should be put into studying the income and demographic profile of households in particular locations before any project is launched. Economic uncertainties also affect the overall demand in the property market. Purchasers are more sensible in making decisions in the current market, so property developers must ensure that they launch the right properties to meet the demand. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nI do not have a favourite historical building, but I think it is important to preserve such buildings because of their historical and cultural value. \\u00a0 Edward Chong\nManaging director, IJM Land Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nMy wish is for all Malaysians to stay positive, embrace the future with confidence, live together in peace and harmony and have access to a quality home. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nAffordable housing is an important issue that needs to be addressed by multiple stakeholders such as government agencies, policymakers, financiers, utility providers and developers. They need to work together to enable more Malaysians to own a home. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nThe iconic Petronas Twin Towers has been a towering beacon of architectural innovation for the last 22 years and serves to seed progressive forward thinking on city planning and development. It draws global attention to Malaysia and the growth of the nation as it marches towards developed country status. \\u00a0 Datuk Tan Hong Lai\nManaging director and CEO, Green Target Group Sdn Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nAs a Malaysian, I wish that we can value and appreciate each other. I look forward to seeing all Malaysians realising the importance of each other in building the nation and creating Malaysia Baru. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThe government and private sector should work together to provide better housing schemes for the public. The foreign workers policy should be looked at to smooth out construction activities. Also, developers are facing hefty compliance costs such as utilities contributions and other authorities\\u2019 requirements. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nMy favourite historic building is the Stadthuys, or the \\u201cRed House\\u201d, in Melaka. Built in 1650, it is the oldest Dutch building that is still standing in the East. The fact that it is still standing strong shows the quality of the workmanship back then. \\u00a0 Datuk Zamani Kasim\nCEO, Astaka Padu Sdn Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nImproved racial integration and an enhanced Malaysian identity. We need to create stricter laws to punish those who make racially charged comments, especially politicians. The government should rationalise the development objectives of the country for the rakyat, especially the poor, and low and middle-income, rather than showing strong economic indicators whose benefits are not realised by the rakyat. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThe government should promote sustainable development and caring for the environment to benefit the current and future rakyat. Corruption needs to be wiped out completely. The education system needs to be reviewed to create well-balanced individuals. Review the approach to and implementation of affordable housing. Singapore\\u2019s Housing Development Board is a proven example. Business and economic development targets should be further enhanced. Tracking of implementation needs to be improved to ensure that targets are met and jobs are created to meet current and future demand. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nThe Malay traditional home is my favourite. It is green, adapts to the climate and culture, and is aesthetically pleasing. Ezumi Harzani Ismail\nPresident, Pertubuhan Akitek Malaysia (PAM) What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nTo end corruption. We should focus on improving financial management and contract procurement, and curbing abuse of power by local authorities. These are the areas that are always prone to corruption.\nThere is also a need to reinvest in good education and reinstate the budget for higher education that was previously cut.\n\\u00a0What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nOver-regulation in the housing industry is limiting its growth. And there is a mismatch between demand and supply of lower and mid-range properties. Restrictive financial rulings limit property ownership. Tighten rules over other types of spending, but not on purchase of property. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nThe Sultan Abdul Samad Building opposite Dataran Merdeka in Kuala Lumpur. The icon was fully restored to its original condition by me and my team at Arkitek MAA Sdn Bhd in 2008. Built in 1897, it was a government office before becoming a courthouse. \\u00a0 Datuk Sri Amrin Awaluddin\nGroup managing director, Sime Darby Property What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nSime Darby Property hopes to contribute towards building a great nation that can punch above its weight globally. We are a country with great potential and our diverse communities must come together for nation building. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nAffordable housing for first-time homebuyers, unsold stock and the rising cost of doing business. Sime Darby Property will ensure that our products are offered at the right time with the right price, given the soft market. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nIt is the iconic Stadthuys building in Melaka. It has evergreen architecture and is solidly built. It is still standing although it was built more than 360 years ago. Stadthuys is the oldest remaining Dutch colonial building in Asia. It has a rich past that blends well with Melaka\\u2019s local culture and historic attractions. The building also brings back good memories of my childhood spent in Melaka. \\u00a0 Foo Gee Jen\nManaging director, CBRE I WTW What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nLet\\u2019s stop shooting ourselves in the foot. It\\u2019s time for a paradigm shift from affirmative policies to meritocracy, and to develop and provide fair opportunities for all Malaysians. Our education system should impart skills, inspire ingenuity and cultivate values of love and acceptance. Education is a necessity that needs to be enhanced. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nHouse unaffordability could lead to social illnesses. This requires multi-level commitment to streamline actions, reduce red tape and compliance, and elevate incomes. Gazette local and structure plans for transparent practices, revisit the town planning Act and requirements for sustainable development. Lastly, improve the efficiency of the public transport system. Make it more accessible and affordable. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nAfter 61 years, Malaysia is renewing its aspiration to embrace diversity. Kampung Kling Mosque, Cheng Hoon Teng Temple and Sri Poyyatha Vinayagar Moorthi Temple \\u2014 all located within a stone\\u2019s throw of each other in Jalan Tokong, Melaka \\u2014 reflect our embodiment of diversity 300 years ago, long before we called ourselves Malaysians. \\u00a0 Tang Chee Meng\nCOO, Henry Butcher (M) Sdn Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nIt is my wish that, learning from the mistakes and shortcomings of the previous administration, the new government will be able to get the country back on track to become a developed and progressive nation based on policies that are transparent, equitable, non-discriminatory and people-centric. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThe three issues are providing every Malaysian with accommodation that is not necessarily based on the ownership model, relaxing lending guidelines but ensuring that the household debt ratio is still manageable and ensuring that projects are not overburdened by excessive costs to keep prices in check. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nMy favourite is the Moorish-styled Sultan Abdul Samad building. It is an iconic and historic landmark in Kuala Lumpur and a popular tourist attraction, especially since it is located opposite the Tudor-style Selangor Club and Dataran Merdeka. \\u00a0 Michael Geh\nPresident, FiABCI Malaysian Chapter What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nWe should emphasise doing things right from the outset. What we have been doing all this while is very wrong and there is a need to change mindsets. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nLowering all costs in the delivery of affordable housing is vital, as is making available loans for affordable housing. Our building construction system has remained the same over the last decade and we need to have modern construction systems such as IBS (industrial building system) and BIM (building information system) in place for better efficiency in building management. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nBangunan Sultan Abdul Samad, which is most visible during parades and is widely televised. \\u00a0 Sulaiman Saheh\nHead of research, Rahim & Co What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nWith a vision of attaining a more liveable and happier all-inclusive-Malaysia, I wish for a more equitable, sustainable and transparent system that is adaptive and proactive to the needs of the people. Moreover, build and improve on the existing system rather than \\u201cscratch & build new\\u201d for better resource-efficiency, with firmer practice and enforcement on ground. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nFirst, there is a disparity between disposable incomes and new launch prices, which leads to larger numbers of unsold properties. Second, we need a better and more reliable central database system that is publicly accessible to enable all stakeholders to make more prudent and informed decisions. We need to unify the affordable-home agencies under one roof. And we need to empower and encourage more urban regeneration and renewal, enabled by a new \\u2018collective sale\\u2019 mechanism. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nA\\u2019Famosa in Melaka is a reminder of how we can lose our own country and how the people fought to earn back our autonomy (although it was subsequently taken over by the Dutch, and only four centuries later did we regain independence). Today, we need to remind ourselves that neo-colonialism is still an ongoing threat that has now manifested in non-physical ways. \\u00a0 Datuk Lai Voon Hon\nGroup managing director, Ireka Corp Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nMy wish for Malaysia Baru is to regain our status as one of the most progressive and advanced countries in Southeast Asia. Malaysia Baru should strive to not only be advanced in terms of technology and business but also in social, political and cultural development. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nAffordable housing for all Malaysians. There is a need for a comprehensive review of all delivery processes, including land and planning approvals, high charges by utilities companies for residential projects and government funds for maintenance of low-income housing. We should introduce modern planning guidelines for assisted, independent and senior living. We should promote Malaysian My Second Home more. We should promote Malaysia as a regional hub and head office for multinational corporations through incentives and trade promotions so that we can increase the take-up rate of high-end apartments, offices and hotels in city centres. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nOne of my favourite historic buildings is the old Kuala Lumpur Railway Station. It used to showcase the importance of Kuala Lumpur as the largest railway hub in Malaya. I hope the railway station can soon be restored to its former glory as a modern transport hub and hotel, much like King\\u2019s Cross St Pancras in London. \\u00a0 Anwar Syahrin Abdul Ajib\nManaging director and CEO, UEM Sunrise Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nA robust and thriving economy spells a brighter future for everyone. My hope is for the government to propel the economy by proactively encouraging and creating policies that attract foreign direct investments and promote local enterprises to prosper internally and externally. We need policies that promote long-term sustainable growth \\u2014 and these policies must be equitable and inclusive. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThere is a mismatch between new housing supply and household demand and affordability. In addition, there are multiple agencies dealing with, and providing, affordable housing. A one-stop agency would be most efficient and effective. I see the need to streamline processes to reduce compliance costs. There is also a lack of transparency and availability of up-to-date and reliable market data. An integrated database of market supply and demand indicators would help developers and financiers make more informed decisions. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nThe Kuala Lumpur Railway Station, a Mughal-influenced building, is classic in style yet intricate in detailing. This building brings back memories of my schooldays when I had to travel between Kuala Lumpur and Kuala Kangsar. It was a time of mixed emotions. It was hard to leave my family but at the same time, I was also looking forward to being with my friends. I can still remember being dropped off at the station and walking through the building to the platform to take the Ekspres Sinaran Pagi back to Kuala Kangsar. \\u00a0 Datuk Soam Heng Choon\nPresident, Real Estate and Housing Developers\\u2019 Association Malaysia What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nOur wish is for Malaysia Baru to be a nation that has dignity and respect. We wish for fair and inclusive policies that will safeguard the unity of the people with diverse backgrounds, cultures, races and religions. No parties should be marginalised and everyone should be taken care of from both the economic and social aspects. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nFirst is the increasing cost of doing business, which is affecting house prices for the rakyat. The government should look into ways to address this issue in order to assist the rakyat in owning homes.\nSecond is homebuyers\\u2019 ability to secure end-financing. This is especially so for first-time purchasers. Third is affordable housing, which is encumbered by various issues such as cross subsidisation, lack of comprehensive data and distribution and resale of subsidised housing. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nThe Kuala Lumpur Railway Station. Built more than a century ago, it was the main railway station connecting the north and south. Today, it still serves as an important hub for commuters in Kuala Lumpur. It has a fascinating architecture that combined both east and west elements. The beautiful architecture is one of the main factors that it is recognised as an iconic building, attracting tourists from all over the world. \\u00a0 Tan Sri Leong Hoy Kum\nGroup managing director, Mah Sing Group Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nMalaysia is a country that was built on unity, regardless of race, creed and culture. History has proven that as a united nation, we can achieve great things. I hope the rakyat will continue to stand together to build an even better Malaysia for all the generations to come. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nAffordability should be redefined. Also, there is still a big demand-supply gap in Malaysia with more than 120,000 new households formed each year, compared to 88,000 new houses completed each year, from 2012 to 2017. To revive the sluggish market,\\u00a0 we suggest the following: \\u00a0 Chen King Hoaw\nManaging director, LandServe Sdn Bhd What is your wish for Malaysia Baru?\nI wish to see a progressive government that truly cares for every single person who contributes to nation building. I wish that everyone, regardless of race and religion, will work and live together in harmony, making Malaysia a great multiracial nation. What are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nThe three issues are the property overhang, escalated and unaffordable property prices, and lack of coordination among numerous approving authorities and agencies, which continues to contribute to the overhang and mismatch between location, property type and pricing. Which is your favourite historic building in Malaysia, and why?\nMy favourite is the Sultan Abdul Samad Building for the richness of its design, which is similar to buildings built by the British in India during the 19th century. Dataran Merdeka, which lies across the road, used to be the venue for the National Day parade. I would watch the parade on the television without fail when I was young and the building makes a spectacular backdrop."}, "3": {"date_posted": "29/8/2018", "title": "There\\u2019s more to Samchem than chemicals ", "article": " RIDING on industrial production expansion and manufacturing sector growth over the past decades, Samchem Holdings Bhd has established itself as one of the largest distributors of industrial chemicals in the Asia-Pacific. However, it has remained largely under the radar of investors despite boasting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 55% in earnings from the financial year ended Dec 31, 2014 (FY2014) to FY2017, when profits ballooned from RM5.96 million to RM22.4 million. In fact, Samchem\\u2019s operations have expanded to such an extent in Vietnam that it is in the midst of spinning off its Vietnamese business unit on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange. \\u201cWe would like to think that our shares are undervalued. In terms of price-earnings ratio (PER), we are only trading at about 10 times. For a growing company like us, I think we deserve a higher stock valuation,\\u201d Samchem founder and executive chairman Ng Thin Poh tells The Edge in an interview. Its competitors Nylex (M) Bhd \\u2014 a unit of Datuk Dr Siew Ka Wei\\u2019s Ancom Bhd \\u2014 and Luxchem Corp Bhd are trading at PERs of 7 times and 15 times respectively, although it may not be an apple-to-apple comparison. It is learnt that Samchem focuses mainly on making liquid chemicals whereas Luxchem mainly produces solid powder chemicals. Ng founded Samchem in 1989 and listed it in June 2009. Today, the 60-year-old remains the single largest shareholder with a 44.59% direct stake. Based in Shah Alam, Selangor, Samchem supplies about 500 different petrochemicals and services more than 7,000 clients \\u2014 from industries such as automotive, paints and inks, oil and gas, and agriculture \\u2014 across the region. It represents ExxonMobil Chemical, Shell Chemicals, Petronas Chemicals and BASF, which are some of the largest global producers of petrochemicals in this region. Samchem chief operating officer Eugene Chong Wee Yip says after more than 20 years of collaborating with these principals, the group expanded to Asean countries and acquired a wider range of products for distribution, including speciality premium chemicals. \\u201cWe are a distribution house for all these well-known brands. We gather all their strong products, package them and sell them to our customers,\\u201d he says. Among others, it supplies raw materials to pesticide manufacturers Imaspro Bhd and Hextar Holdings Sdn Bhd and agrochemical and fertiliser specialist Halex Holdings Bhd. Chong explains that Samchem is akin to a marketing arm for the likes of ExxonMobil, Shell, Petronas and BASF, as these multinational corporations would rather focus on their research and development work, identify new market trends and deliver innovative products. In FY2017, Samchem posted a 35% increase in revenue to RM937.5 million from RM697.2 million a year ago, while its earnings grew to a record RM22.4 million. Malaysia is the largest contributor to the group with a revenue of RM500 million but Samchem also has operations and strong business presence in Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore. In FY2017, its overseas operations registered strong growth owing to the rising demand for petrochemicals in Asean. Vietnam, which has been Samchem\\u2019s most successful overseas expansion, contributed significantly with revenue increasing 38% to RM303 million from RM220 million. Meanwhile, Samchem Indonesia charted a 28% increase in revenue to RM124 million while Singapore\\u2019s revenue contribution almost tripled to RM11 million. Ng says Samchem\\u2019s turnover could hit the RM1 billion mark in FY2018 and its earnings will continue to grow. \\u00a0 Spin-off listing in Vietnam While Ng declines to share the details of the initial public offering (IPO) in Vietnam, he says the Vietnamese firm will implement a 50% dividend policy after the spin-off listing. Based on the RM10 million profits the Vietnamese operations made in FY2017, RM2.5 million to RM3 million will be effectively distributed back to Samchem as dividends. \\u201cCurrently, Samchem has 63.25% equity interest in the Vietnamese firm. We will enlarge our share capital by 20% during the IPO. Subsequently, our shareholding will be diluted to over 50%, but it is still a controlling stake,\\u201d he says. Ng says the Vietnam IPO is likely to be held as early as the first quarter of next year if market conditions are good. \\u201cWe have submitted all the applications. We hope to put everything in place by the end of this year. We should be able to get the approval by September or October. We had an investor briefing last month. We have not announced the IPO price, but it is not a big IPO.\\u201d He points to the Vietnamese population, which is almost three times Malaysia\\u2019s. Based on Samchem\\u2019s product portfolio, the size of the chemical market in Vietnam is twice the size of Malaysia\\u2019s. \\u201cWe want to enhance the confidence of our customers and suppliers. We want to be a local player. We will bring some money into the company to expand to other Indochina countries such as Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos.\\u201d In other words, says Chong, Vietnam will be the regional hub and be central to Samchem\\u2019s investments in Indochina. \\u201cOur Vietnam operations can be self-funded. They will be relying less on Malaysia so that we can focus on growing the Indonesia and Singapore businesses, as well as the Philippines and Thailand in the future.\\u201d \\u00a0"}, "4": {"date_posted": "28/8/2018", "title": "SE Asian stocks rise on US-Mexico trade deal; Singapore gains 1%", "article": " BENGALURU (Aug 28): Southeast Asian stock markets edged higher on Tuesday as concerns over global trade war eased after the United States and Mexico made a deal to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

It is optimistic about securing more UHP projects from China, where capital spending is at a record high as the country continues to ramp up production capacity of memory chips and integrated circuits, in conjunction with its \\u201cMade in China 2025\\u201d policy. UHP systems are Kelington\\u2019s largest revenue contributor, making up 73% of its top line for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 (1QFY18), up from 42% in 1QFY17, which Kelington chairman and chief executive officer Raymond Gan said is due to China\\u2019s semiconductor expansion. The group, which in January this year forecast a net profit growth of up to 30% for FY18, is also keeping to its double-digit earnings growth projection. It remains bullish about its growth, with China as its \\u201cmain growth engine\\u201d, said Gan in a recent interview with The Edge Financial Daily. In 1QFY18, Kelington\\u2019s revenue contribution from China almost quadrupled year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM46.7 million from RM11.8 million. China\\u2019s contribution alone made up 54% of the group\\u2019s total revenue during the quarter. Under the UHP system segment, the group serves industries that require UHP gases and chemicals in specialised applications, such as semiconductor manufacturing, which is the \\u201ccore\\u201d industry the group serves. Though the US-China trade war is seen as a key risk to the semiconductor industry, Gan is unfazed. He believes the industry as well as the group\\u2019s semiconductor business will continue to grow for the next three to five years. \\u201cWe have seen that the number of projects that have been put out for tendering increasing a lot. So we definitely can see that the momentum is growing,\\u201d said Gan, adding that this has enabled Kelington to be more selective in identifying its clients. \\u201cOur UHP [segment] is more focused on the higher end of the value chain, such as chip manufacturing, and wafer fabrication, which China still lacks.\\u201d The two new UHP projects it expects to secure will come from China and Singapore, said Gan. As at July 15, Kelington had secured new contracts worth RM236 million year to date, bringing its outstanding order book to RM341 million. It has bid for another RM1 billion worth of jobs. Of the RM341 million outstanding order book, UHP projects top the list with 56% of orders, followed by process engineering (29%), general contracting (14%) and the industrial gas business (1%). For the industrial gas business, Gan said Kelington is also eyeing to secure two more projects, though he was close-mouthed about the details. Up to 90% of the group\\u2019s order book will be fully recognised this year, said Gan, which means it will see at least RM272.8 million worth of sales recognised this year. The group is targeting to achieve a net profit margin of about 5% for FY18. Its net profit margin climbed from 2.6% in FY16 to 3.8% in FY17 and reached 4.9% in 1QFY18. \\u201cWe [want to] try to sustain a steady growth. Since last year, we have started to fine-tune and increase our efficiency by getting meaningful projects, and running projects more profitably,\\u201d said Gan. \\u201cWe do not aim to immediately double or triple our revenue as we want to have steady growth,\\u201d he said, adding that the group wants to grow its gross profit margin level more so than revenue. In 1QFY18, Kelington\\u2019s net profit more than doubled y-o-y to RM4.21 million from RM2.07 million, as revenue grew 53% to RM86.55 million from RM56.5 million. Kelington\\u2019s full-year net profit for FY17 jumped 38% y-o-y to RM12.26 million from RM8.87 million, despite revenue slipping 8% to RM317.42 million from RM343.34 million. While UHP was the star performer in 1QFY18 in terms of revenue, the remainder consisted of process engineering (17%), general contracting (9%) and industrial gases (1%). Though the contribution from the last \\u2014 industrial gases \\u2014 looks dismal at this juncture, the group expects it to become a core contributor in the next five years. This is because Kelington will be attaining a new recurring revenue stream under its industrial gas business, Gan said, and the group will continue to invest in it. He was referring to the agreement it secured from Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) last November, under which it will purify and liquefy carbon dioxide waste gas for Petronas into liquid carbon dioxide (CO2) at a new plant it is building, to be sold to end users. The agreement is for 15 years, starting from 2019. \\u201cWe think we will see the full-earnings impact in five years, but the impact will only be seen on the third-year operations ... when the CO2 plant starts production. We will only start seeing meaningful revenue from 2020, as the plant will only be ready in 3QFY19,\\u201d said Gan. Gan added that the industrial gas business is a high-profit-margin business, with the gross-profit margin averaging about 30% to 40%. Kelington also sees expansion opportunities in Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines for its industrial gas, which is in tandem with growing demand for industrial gases in the region. In just two years, Kelington\\u2019s share price has jumped 188% from 30 sen to close at 86.5 sen last Friday. This brings its market capitalisation to RM218.64 million. But Gan thinks Kelington\\u2019s share price is still \\u201cundervalued\\u201d. Since initiating coverage of the stock at 66 sen, Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice president Vincent Lau said the research house remains positive about Kelington\\u2019s prospects. \\u201cKelington\\u2019s 1QFY18 results were strong and we expect the upcoming 2QFY18 results to remain strong,\\u201d said Lau. Rakuten forecasts Kelington\\u2019s net profit to reach RM20 million in FY19. Kelington, with its UHP core business, also has no direct peer in the Asean region, according to Lau. The closest is China\\u2019s PNC Process Systems Co Ltd, which has a trailing 12-month price-earnings ratio of 108 times. In comparison, Kelington\\u2019s 15 times looks much cheaper."}, "7": {"date_posted": "21/8/2018", "title": "Most SE Asian markets rise on Sino-US trade-talk hopes", "article": " BENGALURU (Aug 21): Most Southeast Asian stock markets rose on Tuesday on hopes that the United States and China would be able to ease trade hostilities, while US President Donald Trump's comment about the Fed rate hike cycle calmed nerves about foreign fund outflows.

In an exclusive interview with The Edge, Rozabil, who is president and group CEO, says he has no plans to sell his stake, but will continue to run the group and grow the business. However, he does not discount the possibility of getting fresh funds from new investors. \\u201cIt is a public company. As far as I am concerned, this is my destiny, it is not short term for me. I would love to build up and run this company. As a public company, it goes by the terms and regulations. \\u201cIf there is a strategic investor, for instance, why not? If there is, and if we think that our expansion needs more funds, why not?\\u201d he replies to a question about new investors in the wake of talk that Destini is seeking investments via Project Aero. In a purported fact sheet on Project Aero sighted by The Edge, Destini is promoted as an \\u201copportunity to invest in a fast-growing integrated engineering solutions provider\\u201d. But rumours of a change in shareholders could have been prompted by the general perception of Destini as a \\u201cpolitically linked\\u201d company as it used to land many government contracts. Hence, it is also perceived to be vulnerable to a change in government \\u2014 it was one of the counters badly battered following Barisan Nasional\\u2019s stunning loss of power in the 14th general election. Destini plunged 40.7% to 25.5 sen on May 14, when the stock market resumed trading a week after the polls, before sliding to its lowest in a year of 20.5 sen on May 24. Its share price has since retraced 70.73%, closing at 35 sen last Thursday \\u2014 still a distance from its 52-week high of 65.5 sen. Industry observers say Rozabil wants to exit Destini, or at least reduce his 26.5% stake following the administrative change in Putrajaya. Rozabil maintains that he does not have to sell his stake to make way for new investors and says the group can issue up to 10% of its share base to new investors if Destini needs funds for its expansion programme. To underscore his commitment, Rozabil has come up with a five-year plan to wean Destini off its dependency on government contracts, by focusing on both organic and inorganic growth. The plan includes the acquisition of two Europe-based aircraft safety and survival component businesses, which he says, will be a very substantial acquisition for Destini. \\u201cWe will go big in terms of commercial aviation by either organic growth or M&A. We have set up our safety equipment MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) shop in Bukit Jelutong, in partnership with Avia Technique Ltd. We have two companies based in Europe on our radar now for the component shops as well.\\u201d Destini Aviation Sdn Bhd, the group\\u2019s aviation MRO engineering service subsidiary, has set up a safety equipment inspection, repair and overhaul service facility in Bukit Jelutong in a joint venture with UK-based Avia Technique. The company counts Malaysia Airlines Bhd, AirAsia Bhd and AirAsia X Bhd as its customers. Destini has a RM322 million contract to supply six scout-attack helicopters from MD Helicopters to the Malaysian Army Aviation. However, keen to earn more than a one-off margin from the supply contract, Destini approached MD Helicopters to set up an exclusive service centre for the latter\\u2019s fleet of commercial and military aircraft within Malaysia and managed to clinch the deal. Through a joint venture with Sapura Aero Sdn Bhd, Destini was also appointed the authorised sales representative for MD Helicopters in Malaysia, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. These acquisitions and tie-ups, its existing businesses in the aircraft safety and survival equipment MRO as well as oil and gas (O&G) decommissioning and tubular running services (TRS) will act as catalysts for Destini\\u2019s commercial businesses. Although up to 80% of its order book comprises government contracts, the group is confident of achieving a more balanced representation in contract value by next year as the construction of the three offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) for the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) reaches its 70% milestone next year, thus reducing the scale of government-related jobs. \\u201cWhen I took over the company, the plan was to go commercial. We have a five-year plan to increase the contribution of commercial contracts to our order book. Currently, 80% of our order book is from government contracts because of the OPV and NGPC projects. \\u201cThese two contracts alone are worth more than RM1 billion. But our commercial businesses are doing well,\\u201d says Rozabil. NGPC refers to the Next Generation Patrol Craft, a type of patrol vessel built by Destini for MMEA. The contract secured in 2015 is worth RM381.3 million. Four of the six patrol vessels have been delivered and the remaining two are to be delivered by October. Perhaps the most visible of Destini\\u2019s commercial businesses is O&G, where it undertakes decommissioning and TRS for the oil majors. Its subsidiary, Destini Oil Services Sdn Bhd, secured a decommissioning contract worth RM20.2 million from Petronas Carigali for the Pulai-B work order recently. It was its second oil field decommissioning (OOFD) contract from Petronas. Research firm CGSCIMB\\u2019s analyst Nigel Foo says the contract should contribute RM4.3 million to RM5.8 million to group net profit, or 0.4 sen to 0.5 sen earnings per share, in the financial year ending Dec 31, 2018. \\u201cWe estimate the profit margin for an OOFD job is high (about 30% to 40% PBT margin) as such jobs are specialised and there are not many such players in the region,\\u201d says Foo in an Aug 2 research report. \\u201cThe long-term outlook will also appear to be bright as according to Destini\\u2019s annual report, 65% of Malaysia\\u2019s over-300 platforms are above the age of 25, which is near the end of their life-cycles. \\u201cThat could mean more OOFD jobs for established players like Destini over the next few years.\\u201d In addition to Malaysia, Rozabil divul-ges, Destini Oil is currently bidding for more decommissioning contracts in Thailand and Vietnam.\\u00a0 A TRS contract in Myanmar also looms for Destini Oil, Rozabil says, adding he is also confident of securing another decommissioning contract from Petronas \\u201cin the near future\\u201d.\n\\u00a0"}, "9": {"date_posted": "21/8/2018", "title": "Buzz: Petronas Gas faces support at key levels \\u2014 technicals", "article": " (Aug 21): Shares of Petronas Gas could rise further, charts suggest ** Gas infrastructure and utilities firm's stock faces strong support at its 200-day exponential moving average ** It also faces support at RM18.1, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the uptrend from Dec 4, 2017 low of RM15.82 to Jan 8 high of RM19.50 ** The Stochastics oscillator %K line has cut above the %D line, a bullish sign ** Broader index up 0.2% on the day"}, "10": {"date_posted": "17/8/2018", "title": "Serba Dinamik inks JV deal to develop Pengerang land", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 17): Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd is formalising its joint venture with Izin Budi Sdn Bhd to develop a land measuring 15.87 acres in Bukit Pelali, Pengerang, Johor.

The general opinion is that only fund houses that have the capital to market their products and a strong agency force to distribute their products would have a good track record when it comes to delivering returns to their customers. However, data provided by investment research and management firm Morningstar Inc show that this may not always be the case. Personal Wealth looks at the three and five-year performance (as at Dec 31, 2017) of Malaysian equity unit trust funds across three categories \\u2014 those that invest in large-cap, mid-to-small-cap and income stocks. The data show that the top-performing unit trusts of large fund houses outperformed those of their mid-sized and small counterparts during the periods under review, especially in the large-cap equity category. However, the top funds of some mid-sized and small firms performed better in the mid-to-small-cap equity category. According to fund managers, mid-sized fund houses have about RM1 billion to RM10 billion under management while small fund houses manage less than RM1 billion. The top three performers in the large-cap category over the past three years were InterPac Dynamic Equity, Manulife Investment Regular Savings and Affin Hwang Select Opportunity. The three funds generated cumulative returns of 56%, 35.12% and 32.55% respectively. They were followed by Public Strategic Growth (29.03%) and AmMalaysia Equity (26.99%). The top-performing large-cap funds over the past five years were Affin Hwang Select Opportunity, which saw a cumulative return of 64.96%, Eastspring Investments Growth (55.8%), AmMalaysia Equity (53.61%), InterPac Dynamic Equity (46.23%) and Manulife Investment Regular Savings (44.94%). However, the picture looks somewhat different in the mid-to-small-cap equity space, where the mid-sized and small fund houses outperformed their larger peers. The top three performers in this category for the past three years were Areca Equity TRUST, Phillip Master Equity Growth\\u00a0 and Eastspring Investments Small-cap, which generated cumulative returns of 60.57%, 55.06% and 53.83% respectively. They were followed by Kenanga Growth (52.07%) and Kenanga Malaysian Inc (50.83%). The top funds in the mid-to-small-cap category over the past five years were Eastspring Investments Small-cap, which saw a cumulative return of 194.18%, Eastspring MY Focus (117.76%), KAF Vision Fund (112.03%), Areca Equity Trust (112.6%) and Kenanga Growth (110.03%). In the income category, the results were mixed. The top three performing funds in the past three years were Hong Leong Dividend, Libra DividendExtra Fund and Affin Hwang Select Dividend, which generated cumulative returns of 44.72%, 39.36% and 32.41% respectively. They were followed by Eastspring Investments Equity Income (31.36%) and AMB Dividend Trust (23.44%). The outperformers in the income category for the past five years were Eastspring Investments Equity Income, which saw a cumulative return of 62.33%, Libra DividendExtra Fund (61.22%), Hong Leong Dividend (57.79%), Affin Hwang Select Dividend (57.24%) and AMB Dividend Trust (46.87%). It is essential to note that this analysis is on the top three unit trusts of most fund houses in the Malaysian equity universe. Fund houses that did not perform well in this universe may have performed better in other asset classes or regions. The six largest fund houses by assets under management (AUM) as at end-2017 were Public Mutual Bhd (RM81.44 billion), CIMB-Principal Asset Management Bhd (RM74 billion), Affin Hwang Asset Management Bhd (RM55.1 billion), RHB Asset Management Bhd (RM47.37 billion), Eastspring Investments Bhd (RM39.8 billion) and AmInvest (RM36.1 billion), the asset management arm of AmBank Group. \\u00a0 Fund size matters There are several reasons big fund houses tend to perform better in the large-cap category while smaller fund houses do well in the mid-to-small-cap space, says Areca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong. For one, big fund houses tend to manage large funds. And the larger the fund, the more it would benefit from a large-cap stock rally. (According to Wong, large funds have about RM1 billion under management while small funds manage RM300 million or less.) These rallies occur when market sentiment turns defensive and investors start pouring money into large-cap stocks, which have stronger fundamentals, more visible earnings and stable dividend payouts. The manager of a big fund would have sufficient capital to deploy into the market to snap up large-cap stocks, which tend to be more expensive than other types of stocks. On the other hand, smaller funds are better positioned to ride the mid-to-small-cap stock rally, says Wong. These funds also provide their managers more flexibility to move in and out of the market faster, which means selling or buying shares quickly at the desired price when market sentiment changes. For instance, say the manager of a RM1 billion fund spots an opportunity to buy into a small-cap company and wants to allocate 5% of his portfolio to the stock, he would find it extremely challenging to do so, says Wong. \\u201cThe fund manager cannot do that. How can he buy 50 million shares on the open market without pushing the share price up? Or sell without pushing it down? The share price would move against him.\\u201d By comparison, the manager of a RM300 million fund could easily buy 15 million shares of the small-cap company and allocate 5% of his portfolio to the stock. He could also trade the stock without moving the share price against him. \\u201cIndustry players say smaller funds are more nimble,\\u201d notes Wong. Richard Cheong, vice-president of investment at Phillip Mutual Bhd and fund manager of the Phillip Master Equity Growth Fund, shares this view. \\u201cSome companies were too small for the big funds to buy into. But we invested in them and grew together with them over the years,\\u201d he says. As at April 23, the top five holdings of Areca Equity Trust were Supermax Corp Bhd, Pentamaster Corp Bhd, RHB Bank Bhd, Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd and MI Equipment Holdings Bhd. The top five holdings of the Phillip Master Equity Growth Fund as at June 30 were Samchem Holdings Bhd, Perak Transit Bhd, Nova Wellness Group Bhd, JF Technology Bhd and Denko Industrial Corp Bhd. \\u00a0 Stock selection remains key The Morningstar data show that fund size is not the only thing that determines the performance of a unit trust fund. For example, in the Malaysian equity large-cap category, one of the top-performing funds was Affin Hwang Select Opportunity. It was one of the largest funds in this space, with RM994 million under management. But another outperformer in this category \\u2014 InterPac Dynamic Equity \\u2014 only had a fund size of RM8.41 million. While it is true that most top-performing funds in the mid-to-small-cap space have RM500 million or less under management, the top-performing Kenanga Growth Fund had AUM of RM1.4 billion while the second-best performer \\u2014 Eastspring Investment Small-cap \\u2014 had RM679 million under management as at May 29, according to its fund fact sheet. Ismitz Matthew De Alwis, CEO of Kenanga Investors Bhd, says investment strategy and stock selection based on solid research by fund managers and their research teams are more important than fund size. \\u201cFund performance is more driven by the investment strategy rather than the size of the firm [and fund]. Different investment strategies outperform in different market cycles. Our team is extremely focused on conducting research and investing in undervalued stocks,\\u201d he adds. The top five holdings of the Kenanga Growth Fund as at June 30 were Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd, Dialog Group Bhd, Yinson Holdings Bhd and Petronas Chemicals Groups Bhd. Gan Eng Peng, director of equity strategies and advisory at Affin Hwang Asset Management, says the team behind Affin Hwang Select Opportunity has been striving hard to identify new investment strategies and bottom-up stock ideas as the fund size has grown. He elaborates on how the fund managed to outperform its peers last year. Gan was an early buyer of large-cap banking stocks as he thought the counters were oversold and undervalued on the back of an improving local and global economic backdrop. He also invested in the real estate investment trust sector, with a view that the abundance of liquidity in the local market would drive prices higher. There was also a restructuring play, where the fund invested in listed companies that had Permodalan Nasional Bhd as one of their major shareholders. That was because a new management group, which included Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar, had joined PNB. The market believed a restructuring would happen under his watch. \\u201cOther big bottom-up ideas included investing in an aluminium smelter company, a politically connected construction company and a regional food and beverage and tank farm operator,\\u201d says Gan. Nevertheless, it is getting more challenging for him and his team to maintain the fund\\u2019s performance as it has continued to grow over the years. They have to work harder to identify more investment ideas and opportunities with the growing amount of investor money. \\u201cThe strong performance of the fund and active promotion by various distribution channels resulted in the doubling of the fund size last year. This was challenging as positions needed to be constantly rebalanced ... and there was a constant search for new ideas throughout the year,\\u201d says Gan. The top five holdings of the fund as at May 31 were CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd, Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd and Petronas Dagangan Bhd. \\u00a0 Take note of volatility \\u00a0 When studying the performance of a unit trust fund, investors should do more than just look at the returns generated. They should also look at the volatility level of the fund as the last thing they want is to react emotionally to market swings and sell their holdings when prices are low. Volatility is expressed by the standard deviation assigned to the funds. Simply put, the term reflects how far the returns of each fund could deviate from its average return over the years. The higher the standard deviation, the more volatile the fund performance, and vice versa. According to the Morningstar data, the standard deviation of Malaysian large-cap equity funds from 2015 to 2017 ranged from 1.94 to 3.23 while the average and median standard deviation were 2.53 and 2.45 respectively. By comparison, the standard deviation of local mid-to-small-cap equity funds ranged from 1.86 to 5.01 while the average and median standard deviation were 3.22 and 3.65 respectively. From 2013 to 2017, the standard deviation of large-cap funds ranged from 1.94 to 3.1 while the average and median standard deviation were 2.51 and 2.55 respectively. The standard deviation of mid-to-small-cap funds ranged from 2.17 to 4.88 while the average and median standard deviation were 3.39 and 3.28 respectively. It is not surprising that small-cap companies are often associated with volatile share price movements and that their stocks usually make up a higher percentage of mid-to-small-cap funds\\u2019 portfolios. This translates into higher standard deviations of these funds. From 2015 to 2017, the standard deviation of Malaysian equity income funds ranged from 1.71 to 4.31 while the average and median standard deviation were 2.43 and 2.2 respectively. From 2013 to 2017, the standard deviation ranged from 1.66 to 4.31 while the average and median standard deviation were 2.36 and 2.27 respectively. \\u00a0 How should investors pick their funds? Financial planners say retail investors should do more due diligence before buying into unit trusts, and not buy into funds just because they are associated with a famous brand name and have more market exposure. \\u201cFund performance has little correlation with brand name and market exposure. The key is the fund manager, investment team and processes. Some smaller fund houses may have these capabilities, but do not have the budget to conduct branding and marketing activities,\\u201d says Yap Ming Hui, founder and managing director of Whitman Independent Advisors Sdn Bhd. Bryan Zeng, general manager of FA Advisory Sdn Bhd, says passively buying into funds based on their brand name is not the right move. Investors should compare and assess funds from various perspectives before making a decision. The risk-adjusted returns, represented by the Sharpe ratio, is an important metric that Zeng uses. The higher the ratio, the better the risk-adjusted returns. This ratio is also favoured by Kevin Neoh, a licensed financial planner at VKA Wealth Planners Sdn Bhd. \\u201cI recommend that investors check out this ratio of the funds from the same category. It tells us how many units of risk the fund manager has to undertake to generate one unit of return. Generally, an equity fund with a Sharpe ratio of 0.5 is considered reasonably acceptable,\\u201d he says. It is essential that investors look at the fees that are imposed on them, such as the sales charge, says Zeng. \\u201cInvestors need to understand that any fees charged by the fund house are a drag on the returns they receive from the funds. This factor must be taken into account before buying into a fund.\\u201d He debunks the belief that better-performing funds impose a higher sales charge on investors. \\u201cThe sales charge should be determined by the services provided to the investors. It should not be purely based on past performance because past performance does not guarantee future performance,\\u201d he says. Those who invest in equity funds via unit trust agents are typically charged a 5% to 6.5% sales fee. However, those who can make their own investment decisions could buy into funds with a sales charge of 2% or lower via online portals such as fundsupermart.com. Fund size and fund managers are the two things investors should be aware of, says Zeng. He adds that an equity fund size of less than RM10 million is too small and \\u201cmay not be adequately diversified\\u201d. It is also likely to entail a higher management expense ratio (MER), which will be a drag on the fund\\u2019s performance. The MER is the cost of managing and operating a fund. The expenses are generally fixed costs such as management, legal and auditor fees. Funds with higher returns and lower MERs are preferable. The fund manager is crucial to the success of the fund. \\u201cKnowing the fund manager is similar to knowing the management of listed companies. Investors should get a chance to know the fund manager\\u2019s investment philosophy, risk management framework and thought process,\\u201d says Zeng. Neoh says the portfolio turnover rate (PTR) is another factor that investors can look at. The rate tells them how frequent a fund buys or sells its holdings over a 12-month period. A higher PTR indicates that the fund is trading more actively. It is worth noting that the trading and brokerage fees used to measure a fund\\u2019s PTR are not included in the MER. Investors would need to make the effort to obtain such information. For instance, the fund size is readily available on the fund\\u2019s fact sheet. As for the fund\\u2019s Sharpe ratio, investors can log on to Morningstar\\u2019s website. The Lipper Leaders website allows the public to screen funds, enabling them to gauge the funds\\u2019 volatility level via its \\u201cPreservation\\u201d score of one to five \\u2014 the lower the rating, the higher the volatility. The MER and PTR are available in the fund\\u2019s annual report. Yap says investors should attend events organised by fund houses to listen to their fund manager\\u2019s views or to ask them questions. Alternatively, investors can rely on the historical returns and ratings of investment research firms, such as Morningstar and Thomson Reuters Lipper, to have a sense of how each fund has been performing. Yap suggests that investors look at these metrics from a three-year perspective. That is because one year is too short to make a sound assessment while five years is too long. \\u201cThat is because the fund manager may have left and the investing mandate could change after five years, say, from investing only in Malaysian equities to investing in Asian equities. We would reassess the fund in this case as it would no longer fall under the Malaysian equity category,\\u201d he says. Financial planners say the most important thing investors should know is their investment objectives, time frame, risk appetite and preferred asset allocation. After all, they should bear in mind that the ultimate goal of investing is to achieve their short and long-term financial goals."}, "19": {"date_posted": "10/8/2018", "title": "KLCI edges marginally higher, gains seen capped ", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 10): The FBM KLCI edged marginally higher in early trade this morning, against the weaker opening at most regional markets, but gains at the local bourse were seen capped.

Across Bursa Malaysia today, 2.31 billion shares worth RM2.29 billion were traded. Top gainers included Panasonic Manufacturing Malaysia Bhd, Tenaga and Petronas Chemicals. Leading decliners included KLCI-linked stocks IHH Healthcare Bhd, Petronas Gas Bhd and MISC Bhd. At a glance, the Malaysian stock market today appeared to have taken cue from overnight crude oil losses on Wednesday. Reuters reported that oil prices slid about 3 percent on Wednesday as a trade dispute between the US and China escalated further and after Chinese import data showed a slowdown in energy demand. Brent crude futures fell US$2.37 to settle at US$72.28 a barrel, a 3.17 percent loss. US West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell US$2.23 to settle at US$66.94 a barrel, a 3.22 percent loss. The session low of US$66.32 was the lowest since June 22. On Thursday, oil prices eked out gains, reflecting concerns about Iranian crude supplies as the US hit Tehran with new sanctions, halting Wednesday's declines in the face of an escalating China-US trade dispute and worries over Chinese demand, Reuters reported."}, "21": {"date_posted": "9/8/2018", "title": "Petronas Chemicals advances; volume doubles", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 9): Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd shares rose 2.1 percent, as Malaysia's benchmark index advanced.

Nonetheless, Sapura Energy had not been singled out as most of its oil and gas peers faced the same fate after the meltdown in crude oil prices. Its co-founder Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin, whose remuneration package has hogged the limelight, is confident of the group\\u2019s prospects, despite the increasing need to address its whopping RM16 billion debts. Shahril, who is also president and CEO, tells The Edge that Sapura Energy made a contrarian move to expand its business at the peak of the downturn. \\u201cWe decided to leverage the assets we owned to get more jobs \\u2026 in order to make up for the Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) margin that was shrinking. [There were] very few jobs in Asia.\\u201d With that strategy, Sapura Energy has increased its global footprint, winning contracts in Mexico, Brazil, the Middle East as well as Asean. The group\\u2019s order book is currently at RM16.7 billion. In short, Sapura Energy is not a jaguh kampung that survives on local jobs. The group has a prospective market of US$350 billion to tap compared with US$38 billion previously, according to Shahril. At last Thursday\\u2019s closing of 61 sen, Sapura Energy had a market capitalisation of RM3.65 billion \\u2014 which is too low, says Shahril. The group\\u2019s upstream operation, which it intends to float soon, alone is worth RM7 billion, he explains. It is a bargain for investors at the current price, which is only 13% of its all-time high of RM4.84 achieved on Dec 30, 2013. Looking at analysts\\u2019 recommendations compiled by Bloomberg, Sapura Energy seems to be a \\u201cscreaming buy\\u201d. Less than a handful of the analysts have a \\u201chold\\u201d call. Target prices range from 61 sen to RM1.30. Analysts see value in Sapura Energy because of its ability to generate a healthy operating cash flow, but the group\\u2019s high gearing is a major concern, considering that the O&G business is capital intensive. MIDF Research analyst Aaron Tan notes that the soft share price has been largely due to sentiment, and adds that the fundamentals of the group remain intact given its ability to generate cash. \\u201cFrom a fundamental standpoint, nothing has changed for the company. In fact, the order book is still very strong. The production rates of its gas fields are still decent and the costs of production for its gas fields are very low,\\u201d Tan explains. He points out that the gas sales agreement signed with Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) will augur well for Sapura Energy\\u2019s earnings growth moving forward. Also, the group\\u2019s overseas ventures are doing well, he adds. \\u201cThey (Sapura Energy) have been proving themselves as a capable contractor and have secured many high-profile works. The management is sound and has the experience and should know what it is getting into when it ventures into new markets,\\u201d he says. Tan adds that the group\\u2019s move into Brazil was a good one, considering that a chunk of the group\\u2019s income has been supported by its operations there. According to Affin Hwang Research, the engineering and construction (E&C) segment returned to the black quarter-on-quarter with a profit of RM36.5 million in 1QFY2019, attributable to a doubling of its operating profit in its Brazilian operations, compared with a RM84 million loss in 4QFY2018. A fund manager, who wishes to remain anonymous, concurs that the group would be a beneficiary of an impending recovery in crude oil prices, but notes that the group\\u2019s high gearing of 1.61 times is a key risk. \\u201cWe like the O&G segment and we think that crude oil prices will be sustained at the US$60 to US$70 level. I wouldn\\u2019t discount that the sentiment would be more bullish at some point based on the current state of demand and supply.\\u201d That said, the group\\u2019s debt-heavy balance sheet has made him hesitant despite its current low price. The fund manager says the rising interest rate environment could pose a threat to Sapura Energy, depending on the group\\u2019s exposure to US dollar-denominated borrowings. \\u201cThe group\\u2019s gearing is too much. If it is not handled carefully, there could be cash flow issues down the road. \\u201cIf they have a lot of exposure to US dollar-denominated borrowings, this will also be an issue, especially if the loans are on floating rates.\\u201d As at Jan 31, 2018, Sapura Energy\\u2019s total borrowings was at RM16.4 billion, of which RM10.18 billion was foreign currency-denominated. A large chunk (RM6.82 billion) of its foreign debts are term loans. \\u201cMy problem now is the debt,\\u201d Shahril acknowledges, stressing that the group intends to bring down its gearing ratio by half to 0.7 times in the first half of the financial year ending Jan 31, 2020. It is known that Sapura Energy is exploring options, including an initial public offer and rights issue, to raise funds to slash its borrowings. Shahril confirms that the group is working on a plan to list its exploration and production (E&P) division. It is mulling over a listing on Bursa Malaysia or the Australia Stock Exchange. \\u201cWe could get a higher valuation in Australia but my heart is at home,\\u201d he says. Another analyst, who declines to be named, says the listing of Sapura Energy\\u2019s E&P assets could be a double-edged sword. \\u201cThey might get a good valuation (for the E&P assets). But one of its few profit-making divisions will be removed from Sapura Energy. This will definitely reduce the debt level, but at what cost?\\u201d He adds that a cash call would help to raise fresh capital to pare down Sapura Energy\\u2019s borrowings. However, it would need to convince shareholders that the fresh capital that they pump in will yield good returns. Shahril disagrees that Sapura Energy will lose it shine after it lists the E&P unit. \\u201cEngineering and construction would be the core (business). It would be like what Sapura Crest (Bhd) was before the merger,\\u201d he says, adding that there are enough contracts to keep it going. \\u201cAnd don\\u2019t forget, Sapura Energy will still own a substantial stake in the new listed entity,\\u201d Shahril says, declining to reveal further information on the IPO plan. The contrarian move has put Sapura Energy, a home-grown O&G firm, into the ring \\u201cto rival international players\\u201d, as Shahril puts it. It has a presence in Australia, India, Mexico, Brazil, the Middle East, and East and West Africa. All said, the sceptics may remind investors to be cautious of execution and political risks, which are inevitably in the upstream business worldwide. \\u00a0 \\u00a0"}, "23": {"date_posted": "7/8/2018", "title": "KKB up 3.98% on starting EPCC works for Petronas Carigali job ", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 7): KKB Engineering Bhd rose 3.98% this morning after the company said it has commenced engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC) works for the D18 JT-D wellhead platform off Malaysia last month, which together with the D28 Phase 1 project have a total contract value of RM226 million.

The annual general meeting, he says, was \\u201cdisappointing\\u201d but he is unperturbed, with a lot to do. The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and Minority Shareholders Watch Group (MSWG) opposed some of the company\\u2019s resolutions and made public their displeasure. But how much of an impact will that have on the direction of the company? In an interview with The Edge, Shahril shares some of his thoughts on the outlook for the company, and what transpired at the AGM. Here is an excerpt from the interview. \\u00a0 The Edge: Are the local institutions selling your stock? Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin: But the foreign institutions are buying \\u2026 Usually we won\\u2019t have this issue. Look at my board \\u2014 Tan Sri Hamid Bugo, MACC (Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission) adviser, state secretary of Sarawak, chairman of Petros (Petroleum Sarawak Bhd) \\u2014 we have people of impeccable standing. (Mohamed) Rashdi (Mohamed Ghazalli), risk, at PwC; Gee Siew Yong \\u2014 everyone knows the government puts her everywhere as she is a smart cookie; Datuk Muhamad Noor Hamid, he is a gas expert\\u2026 The share price went from RM1.50 to 40 sen \\u2026 what do you want the management to do? You can take the capitalist route, which I totally respect. Capitalist shareholders will say, okay \\u2026 lose money, understand the environment, sell your shares and walk, but don\\u2019t talk bad about the company. \\u00a0 Aren\\u2019t you concerned about shareholders selling shares? I am totally fine with that. It\\u2019s your right, it\\u2019s your money. \\u00a0 It was asked if profits were to pick up, would your salary rise as well? He (the EPF representative) is a shareholder, so he has a right to whack me, but it\\u2019s all conjecture. But when we were making RM1.8 billion, my salary was the same. \\u00a0 There were questions as to why you are being compensated when you have not sold any shares. If I sold the shares, it (the share price) would be at 10 sen. \\u00a0 Could it be that shareholders are upset that though the share price has fallen and they have suffered losses, you are still getting the same pay? But who caused the share price to fall? When there are more sellers than buyers, the share price will fall. \\u00a0 How much do you think it (the share price) would be if not for the heavy selling? At least 10% to 20% above net book value. (Sapura Energy\\u2019s net asset per share as at end-April was RM1.58.) \\u00a0 Do you think the massive impairments gave a bad surprise to shareholders last year? If I remember correctly, there were two rounds of impairments. The first caused the share price to fall to about RM1, then the second caused it to fall to below RM1. No \\u2026 the selling caused the share price to fall. If you say it\\u2019s because of the impairments, it would be below 60 sen now. It actually went up after the impairments. You see, impairment is a discipline the management must have, and it\\u2019s a rule \\u2014 you have to mark to market \\u2026 although I know in two years, things will pick up. I could have used all the technical arguments against writing off. But I have to err on the side of prudence. \\u00a0 Actually, Sapura Energy\\u2019s impairments came later when compared with others in the industry. Why? We couldn\\u2019t (do them earlier) because we still had contracts. I actually wanted to do them earlier. The first impairment involved our oil assets; the second, our service rigs and vessels. The rigs and vessels had long-term contracts that did not really end. And they could not obtain new contracts, so we impaired them. Secondly, rates were already coming down. A chunk of the vessel cost will be depreciation. When I write off, the depreciable amount will shrink, which means I will be more profitable at a lower rate for the coming contracts. We took the conservative position. It\\u2019s going to be down for longer. We wanted to be more competitive, therefore we argued with the auditors, we wanted to cut. \\u00a0 Have you had any issues with the EPF? I have no issues with the EPF. It is their own assessment, their own valuation, their right to do what they want. We brief them twice a year, and we explain everything (including remuneration packages) \\u2026 (we tell) all the major shareholders every quarter the strategy. \\u00a0 You have an upcoming IPO (initial public offering). Does the EPF\\u2019s reaction at the AGM worry you? No, it\\u2019s a story of there being more buyers than shares to sell. \\u00a0 Tan Sri, some people have asked how much more you are paid compared to (Tan Sri) Wan Zulkiflee (Wan Ariffin), Petronas\\u2019 president and CEO. Wan Zul sits in a company that has the right to the oil in Malaysia. I have to go and find and pay for it, I have to risk it. Wan Zul is a dear friend of mine. One is an entrepreneur \\u2026 you cannot compare an entrepreneur to the CEO of an institution that has skin in the game. \\u00a0 Is your operating environment still as difficult? This is the result of work for the past three years. We can address Southeast Asia, India \\u2026 we can address Australia, we can address Caspian, we can get Mexico, Brazil, East and West Africa. From just RM38 billion, we have grown to a market opportunity of RM350 billion. This RM350 billion is the market we can look at now, but could not look at before. In order to achieve this, we had to do structural changes, we had to change our processes, we had to expand, develop global centres, put in systems \\u2014 all the things that needed to be done, all these were KPIs (key performance indicators) along the way. You cannot just say, \\u2018I want to go there\\u2019, without putting in the logistics, the processes. It\\u2019s a lot like going to war \\u2014 you need to strategise and be very clear on the route you want to (use to) attack the market. We decided we had to increase our top line. In order to increase our top line, we had to increase our footprint. To do the footprint, we needed to continue to develop the platform and the architecture. The board conditions the management to do the right thing. \\u00a0 So what did you do? We had our traditional markets, but the board said we could not go on giving the same ones (markets), so we won an EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contract. Then, in the US \\u2026 in the US, we can do fundamental design in pipeline construction. That is the very top end of engineering, a company called Peritus. We used that company for the design portion, to bid in Romania for a US$1.5 billion contract. Other evidence \\u2014 in the Middle East, we said we would take (jobs). This year, we won something there. We won a US$4 billion bid in Saudi \\u2014 two contracts. In the Middle East, to win, you have to go through a process. In that process, we have had to bid against five giants \\u2014 McDermott, LNT, Technip, Saipem, Subsea Seven. They value you on, judge you on engineering capabilities, fabrication capabilities, installation capabilities, and project management track record. In Saudi (Arabia), Marjan, there are some jobs where only four (companies) are invited, and we are one of them \\u2026 US$800 million. We were invited \\u2026 Those are the kinds of things we have done to qualify ourselves, to get access to this market. If you look at the Romanian tender, you are only allowed to bid after a technical evaluation. We are in the top three \\u2014 Eni, Technip and ourselves. Now, we have to go for an interview and scrutiny in the US at the head office of Exxon \\u2026 a 50% shareholder with OMV \\u2026 We have already penetrated Europe. This is what we have done. Others have been shrinking over the past three years but we have expanded. In 2017, we only had RM2.5 billion in bids for the year. In 2018, at this time, we are already at RM5.8 billion. If we get all our prospects, there is another RM8.2 billion, which is about RM14 billion already. We won\\u2019t win it all but we will be back to pre-collapse levels. (Sapura Energy\\u2019s current order book stands at RM16.7 billion.) If I said three years ago I wanted to build a global company, who would have believed me? \\u00a0 There is talk that your pay, your compensation for the covenant should be reflected differently in your annual report. And it should not be part of your remuneration package. I don\\u2019t know these things, I am straight. My board is very strict and transparent. But a bank guarantee for RM16 billion at 1% is RM160 million \\u2026 so was the board out of line? \\u00a0 On the listing of your exploration and production (E&P) business, there is a question on the prospects of the parent company after carving out a choice asset. There\\u2019s a RM16 billion order book but mainly in E&C (engineering and construction), but we will have a chunk in an E&P company but the debt comes down. \\u00a0 There are quite a few companies you could list, right? Yes. My biggest problem now is (high) debts. When I reduce my debts, (more) revenue will go straight to my bottom line. \\u00a0 There are two things that shareholders would like to know \\u2014 the impairment cycle and likelihood of a cash call. This is up to you to interpret. A cash call is always an option. \\u00a0"}, "26": {"date_posted": "2/8/2018", "title": "MMHE falls 8.8% on second loss-making quarter", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 2): Shares of Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd (MMHE) fell 8.81% at noon today after the company posted a second consecutive quarterly loss and cautioned investors that \"meaningful\" business opportunities could only come next year.

Quarterly revenue declined 13.3% on-year to RM223.04 million from RM257.27 million largely on lower dry docking repair works owing to deferment by several shipowners. For the first half of FY18, MMHE's net loss widened to RM74.75 million from RM30.31 million in 1HFY17. Revenue in the period fell 16.6% to RM411.31 million from RM493.11 million a year ago. MMHE said in a statement yesterday that the meaningful opportunities can only materialise in 2019 amid a slow recovery in the oil and gas sector.

Construction of the office tower atop a retail podium will commence on a four-acre site near Jalan Binjai in Kuala Lumpur after 2030.

Using the heights stated by the Skyscraper Centre as an indication, the proposed Dubai One project, at a height of 711m, will house a total of 161 floors while the Tianfu Centre in Chengdu, at 677m, will be 157 storeys high. \\u201cWhen the government announced the MRT Line 2 project in 2010, it involved a station to be strategically located to provide further connectivity to the KLCC precinct,\\u201d the KLCCH spokesperson says. \\u201cOn May 4, 2017, MRT Corp (MRTC) and KLCCH signed a mutual agreement that paved the way for the integrated transit-oriented development comprising four basement levels (car park), one concourse retail level and four retail podium levels, which also include the foundations for a future tower on KLCC Lots L & M. The MRT2 project includes an MRT KLCC East Station, an underground station on Persiaran KLCC-Jalan Binjai,\\u201d the spokesperson adds. Work has commenced on the KLCC East Station. \\u201cThe concourse and underground car park will be fully integrated with the MRT station, the new North-East Carpark (NEC) with ingress and egress via the new Lorong Kuda Underpass, an extension of the KLCC car and truck tunnel, which is scheduled for completion in 2020. The substructure works for the projects by KLCCH are in progress as planned, concurrently with the MRT station works by MRTC, scheduled to be completed by end-2022. \\u201cThe full development of Lots L, L1, M & N envisages three commercial towers above the podium, which will only be built when full tenancy is pre-secured as KLCCH is not a speculative developer. In view of the current market situation, it is envisaged that the towers will only be built in the distant future (beyond 2030),\\u201d says the spokesperson. The estimated GDV of RM3.7 billion to RM4.2 billion is a back-of-the-envelope calculation by experts based on a 174,240 sq ft site, the current price per sq ft of office space within the KLCC area of around RM2,000 and the potential of a plot ratio of 14 to 16. \\u201cIn 2012, KLCCH undertook a review of the KLCC Masterplan 1995 to enhance the development potential of the remaining undeveloped parcels. This was to ensure that the masterplan\\u2019s legacy continued in the next development phase with fully integrated, mixed-use developments and enhanced by below, on and above-grade connectivity, reaffirming the KLCC precinct as a \\u2018destination\\u2019 and a national symbol,\\u201d the spokesperson explains. \\u201cOur next phase of development saw joint ventures with foreign and local partners, culminating in the ongoing development of Lot 185 and Lot 91. To date, the substructure works at Lot 185 have been completed whilst the superstructure development work of the Lot 91 tower is in progress and targeted for completion by 2020.\\u201d Lot 185 is being jointly developed by KLCCH and Qatari Diar Asia Pacifc Ltd. The 50:50 joint venture is building a commercial development comprising office, retail and hotel. The hotel will be managed by hospitality group Accor Group as a Fairmont property. KLCCH, in another 50:50 joint venture with Sapura Resources Bhd, is constructing an office building on Lot 91, which will be occupied mainly by the latter. According to the spokesperson, a retail study has also been undertaken by Savills, which affirms that the retail and transport services will serve the residential community and hotel and office population in the established area of Persiaran KLCC, Jalan Binjai, Jalan Lumba Kuda and Jalan Tun Razak, in addition to an existing population of about 20,000 within the KLCC precinct. MRT2 will serve a two-million population corridor stretching from Sungai Buloh through the centre of KL to Putrajaya, and is expected to attract even more foot traffic to the KLCC precinct to complement Suria KLCC, whose annual footfall exceeds 48 million. Will the new tower add to the current oversupply of office space in KL? Adzman Shah Mohd Ariffin, CEO and chief real estate consultant of ExaStrata Solutions Sdn Bhd, opines that a proper study has to be conducted to avoid such a situation. \\u201cIt is expected to take some time for the occupancy rate in the office market to improve. With the future supply coming up in Tun Razak Exchange as well as other mega developments in the fringe areas to the tune of 16 million sq ft, the vacancy rate will only improve if demand improves,\\u201d he says. Based on an expected absorption of about one million to 1.5 million sq ft per annum, it could take up to 16 years to fill the available space as well as the incoming stock, he adds. Adzman reckons that Tower M will add another three million to four million sq ft of floor area to the market. \\u201cWith the current trend of office location decentralisation to the fringe and suburban areas due to congestion in the city centre and better accessibility owing to more efficient public transport, it will be a challenge to improve the take-up of office space in the city centre. The feasibility of a mega development such as Tower M may therefore need to take into account future market demand and supply in order to not end up as a white elephant,\\u201d he says. Dispelling such concerns, Previndran says, \\u201cBy 2035, with the current prudent policies being implemented by Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur, we can anticipate a balanced and sustainable development.\\u201d \\u00a0"}, "32": {"date_posted": "17/7/2018", "title": "Barakah Offshore secures one-year contract extension from Petronas", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (July 17): Barakah Offshore Petroleum Bhd has secured an extension to its contract with Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) which is due to expire in December 2018, to December 26, 2019.\\u00a0 In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Barakah said its wholly-owned subsidiary PBJV Group Sdn Bhd has received a conditional contract extension from Petronas for the provision of transportation and installation of offshore facilities via a letter of contract extension dated April 16 2018. \\u00a0 Barakah said the scope of the contract includes transportation and installation of facilities such as pipelines, structures and related equipment for offshore oil and gas fields for Petronas and Production Arrangement Contractors (PACs) within Malaysia.\\u00a0 The value of the contract would depend on the number of work orders issued by the clients during the course of the contract duration, based on mini bidding exercise among contractors. \\u00a0 \"Depending on the actual value of work orders to be secured, the contract is expected to contribute positively towards the earnings and net assets per share of Barakah Group for the entire duration of the contract,\" the filing added. \\u00a0 Shares of Barakah closed 0.5 sen or 3.7% higher at 14 sen at the stock market today, for a market capitalisation of RM115.70 million.\\u00a0"}, "33": {"date_posted": "17/7/2018", "title": "FBM KLCI opens higher", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (July 17): Bursa Malaysia opened higher this morning, despite the mixed global and regional performances of peers as well as overnight trade on Wall Street.

Fortunately, there are still companies whose shares are trading at a bargain with a healthy balance sheet, earnings growth prospects and expansion plans in place. The Edge Financial Daily highlights several undervalued counters with strong fundamentals, supported by movements in key market forces like the ringgit and oil prices. \\u00a0 1. Thong Guan Industries Bhd The poor first-quarter results and the recent equity selldown have pushed down Thong Guan Industries Bhd\\u2019s share price by 38% year-to-date (YTD). Margins for the exporter of plastic packaging products were squeezed by a stronger ringgit and rising operating costs. Its F&B division also stayed in the red, although losses have narrowed. The ringgit has depreciated against the US dollar since April, with year-end estimates varying widely from 3.65 to 4.00 amid persisting headwinds on the greenback and uncertainty over policies of the new Malaysian government that could influence the ringgit. Further, any potential gain in crude oil prices \\u2014 which could hike the ringgit and plastic feedstock prices \\u2014 could be balanced out by a pickup in US shale oil production. To increase sales capacity, Thong Guan plans to commission two new lines by end-2018 and another RM500 million plant in Kedah by the first quarter of 2019, which could house 28 production lines. It has also reportedly signed a contract to supply RM70 million to RM80 million worth of its organic noodles to China annually, pending necessary approvals. The company had cash balances of RM138 million as at March 31, against RM65.75 million in current borrowings, while its gearing ratio stood at 0.19 times. The counter has one \\u201cunderperform\\u201d call by Kenanga Research with a target price (TP) of RM2.25, whereas CGSCIMB Research has given it an \\u201cadd\\u201d call, with a TP of RM4.48. Bloomberg estimated 2018 earnings per share (EPS) of 38.5 sen for the stock. At the latest close of RM2.59, the share price translated into 6.7 times 12-month forward price-earnings ratio (PER). \\u00a0 2. AirAsia Group Bhd Despite a strong net profit growth in the recent quarter, AirAsia Group Bhd shares suffered selling pressure in May after it supported Barisan Nasional in the run-up to the 14th general election (GE14), and also due to a corruption probe into AirAsia India which delayed plans for the unit to go public. Regardless, management is determined to turn the 49%-owned Indian unit to profit in 2018. AirAsia Philippines is also on track for a listing by the second half of 2019. Rising jet fuel prices impacted its core net profit for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Every US$5 (RM19.90)/bbl rise in spot jet fuel prices will reduce the group\\u2019s core earnings by 21%, according to a CGSCIMB Research note dated May 28. AirAsia seeks to mitigate this by improving ancillary sales and group-wide efficiency, including through higher average utilisation rates of its planes. A weaker US dollar could also improve margins for its Philippine and Indonesian units. At end-March, AirAsia had cash balances of RM2.03 billion against short-term borrowings of RM1.42 billion. Its gearing ratio stood at 0.34 times in the same period. Its shares are currently trading at 6.84 times forward-PER based on the last close of RM3.20 and Bloomberg\\u2019s FY18 EPS estimate of 46.7 sen. It has 13 \\u201cbuy\\u201d calls, three \\u201chold\\u201d calls and one \\u201cunderweight\\u201d call, with the lowest TP of RM2.90 by JP Morgan and highest at RM6.30 by Macquarie. \\u00a0 3. DRB-Hicom Bhd Narrowing losses of 50.1%-owned Proton Holdings Bhd in the year ended March 31, 2018, turned DRB-Hicom Bhd profitable for the first time in four years, with a net profit of RM498.44 million on the back of a 6% increase in revenue to RM12.79 billion. DRB-Hicom said the rationalisation exercise of non-industrial assets is expected to be completed by end-2018 \\u2014 largely to refocus its funding on Proton\\u2019s turnaround story. Its aviation unit Composites Technology Research Malaysia Sdn Bhd (CTRM), which turned a profit last year, has secured an order book of RM9.5 billion lasting until 2031. CTRM will also have a new plant by September to add another RM200 million to its annual revenue contribution of around RM900 million. Elsewhere, short-term earnings growth may be minimal from its subsidiaries Honda Malaysia Sdn Bhd and Pos Malaysia Bhd. A weakening ringgit could also hurt margins moving forward. As at March 31, DRB-Hicom had cash and cash equivalents of RM2.85 billion against short-term borrowings of RM2.32 billion, with a gearing ratio of 0.75 times. Despite trading at a 10-year historical PER of around 9.97 times and a high forward PER of 24.03 times, analysts covering the counter are \\u201c upbeat\\u201d based on sum-of-parts (SOP) valuation with six \\u201cbuy\\u201d calls and one \\u201chold\\u201d call \\u2014 with a TP ranging from RM1.99 by AmInvestment Bank Research to RM2.70 by CGSCIMB. \\u00a0 4. Uzma Bhd Integrated oil and gas services equipment (OGSE) firm Uzma Bhd has seen its share price decline in tandem with the decline in the FBM KLCI. The group, which has announced a change in its financial year end, reported a 38.64% fall in net profit to RM24.13 million for the 15-month period ended March 31, 2018, compared with RM39.33 million for the 12 months ended Dec 31, 2016. Revenue slipped 0.72% to RM467.64 million. Aside from foreign exchange losses, the net profit decline was also due to larger operating expenses, which the group said was necessary to incur early on as contracts won earlier are now starting to kick in. Uzma has secured seven multi-year umbrella contracts with Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd since the beginning of this year \\u2014 although the bulk of them are on a on-call basis. It has also scaled up in technology-oriented services with high demand in a low oil price environment, such as well-testing and fishing contracts, and potential products such as laying of non-metallic pipelines, according to analysts. Uzma\\u2019s tender book stood at RM7.3 billion as at end-May. Its order book stood at RM1.4 billion, with another RM400 million expected to come from the umbrella contracts, according to analyst estimates. It commands a 12-month forward PER of 8.82 times, with four \\u201cbuy\\u201d calls and two \\u201chold\\u201d calls presently. Its TP ranges from RM1.04 by Hong Leong Investment Bank Research to RM1.70 by Credit Suisse. \\u00a0 5. OSK Holdings Bhd OSK Holdings Bhd has guided that its property segment will be \\u201cquiet\\u201d in 2018 with fewer ongoing projects. However, unbilled sales had remained attractive at RM1.2 billion as at March 31. Its land bank stood at 2,016 acres (815.85ha), with an estimated gross development value of RM8.5 billion. Its construction division also has an outstanding order book of RM311 million. Meanwhile, its 10.1%-associate RHB Bank Bhd has recently risen to be among the top analyst picks for banking counters amid strong quarterly income growth and expectations of normalising operating expenditure moving forward. Additionally, a few corporate exercises are brewing in the well-established conglomerate, which could prove exciting in the short\\u00a0 to medium term. They include the proposed listing of its cable business unit OCC Cables Ltd on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by end-2018 as it seeks to raise funds for OCC Cables\\u2019 future expansion. The Edge Malaysia weekly also reported in January that OSK was looking to sell its 16-storey Faber Towers in Taman Desa, with a valuation ranging between RM230 million and RM250 million. OSK shares are trading at 4.88 times 12-month trailing PER, although its illiquidity could be unattractive. With consistent dividend payouts over the years, investors can expect an annual dividend yield of 5.22% based on its last closing share price of 99 sen. \\u00a0 \\u00a0"}, "39": {"date_posted": "14/6/2018", "title": "Petronas Dagangan shares advance most this year", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (June 14): Petronas Dagangan Bhd shares rose 3.5 percent, more than any full-day gain since Nov. 13, while Malaysia's benchmark index declined.

Sapura Exploration and Production (Sarawak) Inc (Sapura E&P) is the development and production operator with a 40% working interest in the SK408 development. The estimated reserve for Pepulut has not been revealed yet. Even so, pending the signing of a gas sales agreement with Petronas, which underpins project feasibility, any estimate is likely to be categorised as 2C, not 2P at this juncture. Given that this field is in the vicinity of the Gorek, Larak and Bakong fields of phase 1 in the SK408 PSC, which achieved final investment decision in April 2018, we expect this discovery to further enhance the viability of this project cluster by leveraging on the common infrastructure, pipelines and facilities. As the first three fields will be developed as three separate well-head platforms tied back to the existing processing facility and to the Malaysia Liquefied Natural Gas complex in Bintulu, we expect Sapura\\u2019s fabrication yard utilisation to improve significantly towards the end of the year. The group already secured two Hess Exploration and Production Malaysia BV well-head platforms and the Pegaga central processing platform from Mubadala Petroleum. Sapura E&P\\u2019s financial year 2020 (FY20) forecast production is expected to fall by 12% year-on-year from natural decline. However, the Gorek, Larak and Bakong gas fields in the US$200 million phase 1 of the SK408 PSC are targeted to commence production in FY21, radically transforming annual gas output from two million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) by 10 times to 12 million boe and propel overall hydrocarbon production to 13.4 million boe, up 3.8 times from 3.5 million in FY18. The fields under the SK408 gas field development project, which have an estimated reserve of 2.8 trillion cu ft of gas, are part of the discoveries made by Sapura E&P in its 2014 drilling campaign. The SK408 gas fields will be Sapura E&P\\u2019s second major upstream gas development project in Sabah and Sarawak, after the successful development and commencement of production from the group\\u2019s 30%-owned SK310 B15 gas field late last year.

The group reported a net profit of RM46.97 million for its financial year ended Feb 28, 2018 (FY18), 58% higher than its FY17 net profit of RM29.72 million. Revenue grew by 28% to RM614.68 million. The improvement in performance for Pantech, which is involved in the manufacturing and trading of a wide range of pipes, valves and fittings (PVF) for fluid handling systems, is in tandem with the recovery in the oil and gas (O&G) sector. Crude oil prices have increased by 175% to US$76.87 (RM305.94) per barrel last Friday from US$28 per barrel in early 2016, thus giving support to the O&G sector. Pantech executive director Adrian Tan said the group is positive about prospects for FY19. \\u201cEvery year we set a target of 15% year-on-year revenue growth. We should be able to achieve this looking at some of the O&G projects coming from Sabah and Sarawak and with contribution from export sales from our main export markets such as Indonesia, the US and the Middle East. \\u201cIn 2016, oil prices dropped below US$30 per barrel and this affected the O&G industry as projects slowed down. For us, we were relying on maintenance services during the low oil price environment to [keep the momentum going], and we also embarked on a cost-cutting exercise,\\u201d he told The Edge Financial Daily in an interview. \\u201cToday, oil prices have returned to the normal market situation at over US$70 per barrel and we are seeing more upstream projects coming online. We also benefitted from the shale gas [boom] in the US, which forms part of our export markets, as a lot of our products have been shipped there,\\u201d he said. He added that Pantech\\u2019s manufacturing order book is currently at RM150 million, which would last till September. \\u201cWe are now collecting new orders for October 2018 [onwards],\\u201d shared Tan. Business has been picking up, evidenced by the fact that two of its plants, namely the 21,000 tonnes per year carbon steel fitting plant in Kapar, Selangor and the 16,500 tonnes per year stainless steel pipe plant in Pasir Gudang, Johor \\u2014 are both running at full capacity. \\u201cWe are spending about RM40 million in capital expenditure this year to buy equipment, in order to increase our manufacturing capacity,\\u201d said Tan. Pantech also has a hot-dip galvanising plant in Pasir Gudang, which has a capacity of 48,000 tonnes per year. The plant, which started operations in December 2016, is currently running at 50% capacity. The group\\u2019s sole manufacturing outside Malaysia is its nickel alloys and copper manufacturing plant Nautic Steels Ltd, which is located in the UK. The plant has a capacity of 800 tonnes per year and is currently 65% utilised. Pantech\\u2019s client base comprises mostly leading O&G companies in Malaysia, and the group is on Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u2019s (Petronas) list of international vendors for specified items. The group is also a beneficiary of Petronas\\u2019 Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (Rapid) project in Pengerang, Johor. In FY17, the Rapid project contributed 21% of group revenue, and this increased to 24% in FY18. Pantech has a warehouse in Pengerang to cater for the needs of the project. \\u201cWe have been blessed with the Rapid project, which provides a lot of business opportunities for us. Our business [with parties involved] in Rapid has been booming,\\u201d he said. As of February 2018, the group had a total cash balance including fixed deposits of RM70.22 million. Its total borrowings amounted to RM176 million. \\u201cComparing the cash and fixed deposits against the total borrowings, Pantech Group is not in a net cash position. However, this is not necessarily a bad position as we are employing assets to work. \\u201cPantech Group's borrowings are mainly trade facilities, for our working capital rolling purpose. Our gearing ratio is 0.32 times and this is actually pretty low,\\u201d said Tan. Pantech shares were at an all-time high of 80.1 sen on July 17, 2014 \\u2014 when the oil price was at US$108 per barrel. Its shares plummeted by 55% to as low as 35.9 sen on Aug 26, 2015. Its share price has recovered since then, closing at 60.5 sen last Friday and with a market capitalisation of RM449 million. Its price, according to Bloomberg, is at 8.9 times its forward earnings. This is considered cheap compared with other O&G stocks such as Wah Seong Corp Bhd, which is valued at 10 times, and KNM Group Bhd, which is at 12.19 times. All four research firms that cover Pantech have \\u201cbuy\\u201d calls on the stock. JF Apex has a target price (TP) of 84 sen, TA Securities Research (77 sen), AllianceDBS Research (85 sen), while Kenanga Research has an \\u201coutperform\\u201d call on the stock with a TP of 75 sen. In its note to clients, Kenanga said that its call was premised on Pantech\\u2019s profit margin recovery and its healthy balance sheet, as well as higher order book visibility. \\u00a0"}, "49": {"date_posted": "1/6/2018", "title": "Weekend by numbers: 01.06.18 to 03.06.18", "article": " 5 Musical Delights \\u00a0  Carnival is a musical performance presented by Misa Yamamoto and Felicity Thong, co-founders of the Malaysian Piano Quartet.

We note that the share price has already outperformed the FBM KLCI by nine percentage points (ppts) due to the upturn in crude oil prices over the past six months. Our PChem\\u2019s FY18F to FY20F earnings are maintained as the group\\u2019s first quarter (1QFY18) core net profit of RM1.21 billion generally came in within expectations, accounting for 28% of our FY18F earnings and 30% of consensus, versus 19% to 31% for 1QFY15 to 1QFY17 against their respective years. We highlight that our FY18F to FY20F earnings are 8% to 9% above consensus. The group did not declare a first interim dividend as expected. As we had highlighted in our 4QFY17 results update, the group\\u2019s first half (1HFY18) results are likely to be strong with high plant utilisation rates with only one minor plant maintenance in 2QFY18. However, 2HFY18 earnings could soften as four plants, which include the ethylene cracker, methanol and Asean Bintulu Fertiliser plants, will undergo turnaround activities that could lower the 1QFY18 utilisation rate of 100% to an overall FY18F rate similar to 91% in FY17.

The results were further improved by higher product prices although partly offset by a stronger ringgit. On a year-on-year (y-o-y) comparison, 4QFY17 revenue rose 6% due to higher product prices and commencement of Petronas Chemical Fertiliser Sabah S/B (formerly Sabah Ammonia Urea plant) in May 2017 amid a slight 1ppt improvement in plant utilisation. However, 1QFY18 core net profit dipped 6% y-o-y due to RM120 million under-accrual of FY17 manpower expenses amid a stronger ringgit which offset the impact of higher US dollar revenues. The group\\u2019s product prices have a strong correlation to Brent crude oil prices which have risen 14% since March 31, 2018 to US$79 (RM313.63) per barrel. Likewise, naphtha has strengthened by 13%, while urea 6% and polyethylene 5%. However, benzene and polypropylene was flat, while ethylene fell 10% and methanol 2% due to overcapacity.

The concern stems from a shrinking order book, which may see the company go through a difficult patch in the next couple of years at least. MMHE is 66.5%-controlled by shipping giant MISC Bhd, which, in turn, is a 62.67% subsidiary of national oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas). The stock closed at 76 sen last Wednesday while its net asset per share as at March 31 was RM1.57. Analysts are divided on the stock\\u2019s prospects, although some of them have a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on it based merely on its low valuation. In email replies to questions about a dearth of jobs, MMHE says, \\u201cThe sluggish upstream sector remains a concern to us. We are closely monitoring the situation and have implemented initiatives to stay resilient, which include diversifying into other areas. Currently, we continue to focus on managing cost, optimising resources and improving operational efficiencies to stay competitive.\\u201d It is not known what initiatives MMHE has implemented, but the company\\u2019s financials released early this month were uninspiring, to say the least. In its first quarter ended March 31, 2018 (1QFY2018), MMHE suffered an after-tax loss of RM25.27 million on revenue of RM188.27 million. In the corresponding period a year ago, it posted a net loss of RM16.61 million on sales of RM235.84 million. One of the core issues for the company is replenishing its RM1.3 billion order book, a chunk of which comprises fabrication work amounting to about RM1 billion for the Bokor central processing platform (CPP). To recap, MMHE was awarded the RM1 billion contract in April last year to undertake the engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning of an offshore CPP for Petronas\\u2019 Bokor Phase 3 redevelopment project, located in the Baram Delta off Sarawak. The first steel for the CPP is expected to be cut in the third quarter of this year while the project is slated for completion in the second quarter of 2020. MMHE says the aforementioned RM1.3 billion will last the group until 2020. In a report released last week, TA Securities analyst Kylie Chan Sze Zan says MMHE secured merely RM4 million worth of orders in 1Q2018 \\u2014 far lower than the burn rate of its order book. In the notes accompanying its financials, MMHE says replenishing the order book of its marine and heavy engineering segments remains the priority. It adds that while the steady increase in global crude prices may result in a recovery in oil and gas spending in the coming years, \\u201cthis is unlikely to translate into immediate opportunities in 2018\\u201d. \\u201cThe group is committed to its strategy of expanding into new business segments in oil and gas services to ensure sustainability of income.\\u201d As at March 31, MMHE had cash and bank balances of RM514.56 million and negligible borrowings, putting it in a good position. On whether the company is looking at diversifying \\u2014 using some of its cash pile \\u2014 the spokesperson says, \\u201cOur cash holding is mainly for our working capital. However, if a good opportunity arises that can enhance our value proposition, we will consider it.\\u201d MMHE\\u2019s core businesses include heavy engineering, for which the company has two fabrication yards of about 450 acres in Johor with 2km of seafront, and 450 acres of yard space. Another traditional business is ship repair and dry docking. It is noteworthy that MMHE is building its third ship-repair facility at a cost of RM500 million, which should be ready by 2020. \\u201cThe construction of the third dry-dock facility named Dry Dock 3 is currently 15% complete and is on track to commence operation in 2020,\\u201d it says. According to MMHE, while parent MISC, which has a fleet 120 ships, is a major client, the company managed to secure 26 new clients, both local and international, last year. \\u00a0 What the analysts say Analysts have differing calls on MMHE. For instance, TA Securities\\u2019 Chan has a \\u201csell\\u201d call on the company with a target price of 81 sen, representing a five-sen premium to its close of 76 sen last Wednesday. In a report on MMHE\\u2019s results, Chan says, \\u201cFor the first time since listing (in October 2010) both the heavy engineering and marine segments reported operating losses in 1Q2018.\\u201d TA Securities lowered its FY2018-FY2020 forecasts by 17%-127% after accounting for lower marine vessel repair jobs. It sees the company suffering a net loss of RM2.1 million on revenue of RM887.5 million in FY2018. However, the research house sees MMHE chalking up a net profit of RM17.1 million on revenue of RM1.33 billion in FY2019. AmInvestment Bank\\u2019s Alex Goh has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the stock and pegs a fair value of RM1.13 to it based on a 30% discount to its FY2017 book value, \\u201cunderpinned by a rising momentum of offshore job prospects globally against a backdrop of an improving oil price outlook\\u201d. AmInvestment says MMHE\\u2019s 1HFY2018 results will be weak, given that its yard utilisation remains below its break-even point of 50% as many of its previous projects, such as SK316, Bergading and Baronia CPP, have been completed while existing projects have yet to reach the stage of profit recognition. \\u201cThe stock is trading at a compelling price-earnings ratio of 0.5 times, given the receding risk of further impairments amid brighter tendering prospects, together with attractive dividend yields of 4%,\\u201d Goh says in a note released earlier this month. Nevertheless, while MMHE, at 76 sen, is trading at around its lowest levels since its listing in October 2010, a fund manager says there is a stigma attached to MMHE\\u2019s execution capability. Does the stigma alone warrant such a large discount on the company? \\u00a0 \\u00a0"}, "56": {"date_posted": "22/5/2018", "title": "FY18 volume expected to grow for Petronas Dagangan", "article": " Petronas Dagangan Bhd\n(May 21, RM26.20)\nCut to market perform with a lower target price (TP) of RM25.50: Petronas Dagangan Bhd (Petdag) reported its lowest quarterly earnings in two years, owing to higher product costs coupled with sliding sales volumes. However, we still expect volume to grow by 1% in financial year ended 2018 (FY18) as a fixed or cheaper fuel price should encourage traffic flow. We also see the reversal to old subsidy system having a neutral impact to Petdag. Given the disappointing 1QFY18 and 9% year-to-date (YTD) price appreciation, we cut Petdag to \\u201cmarket perform\\u201d with a revised target price of RM25.50. First quarter in 2018 (1QFY18) core profit of RM210.9m plunged 24% sequentially from RM279.3m in fourth quarter in 2017 (4QFY17) despite revenue inching up by 1% to RM7.07 billion from RM6.99 billion previously. This was principally owing to higher product costs, especially for retail segment, which saw its operating margin deteriorating to 4.5% from 6.3% previously while commercial segment\\u2019s margin fell slightly to 3.5% from 3.6%. Overall, the group\\u2019s operating margin fell to 4.1% from 5.3% previously. On the other hand, the rise in revenue was led by higher average selling price (ASP) which firmed up 3% although sale volume was lowered by 4%. Year-on-year, first quarter in 2018 (1QFY18) core profit contracted 17% from RM252.8m although revenue rose 6% from RM6.69 billion. This was led by the above-mentioned decline in retail earnings on higher product costs, which resulted in segment operating margin falling from 5.6% to 4.5%. However, this was mitigated by higher mogas margin on lower product cost. In addition, operating expenditures (opex) was higher in 1Q18 due to higher salaries, wages and benefit expense. On the other hand, commercial reported lower earnings on higher opex. Overall, retail saw 2% decline in sales volume while commercial posted higher revenue on higher average selling price and volume growth. The new Pakatan Harapan government decided to maintain fuel prices since it won the 14th general election (GE14) on 9 May as opposed to the previous weekly review every Wednesday. The new prime minister said that the government will subsidise whenever costs are higher than selling price. This means it will revert to the old system which was implemented prior to December 2014. Nonetheless, the new measure has neutral impact to Petdag\\u2019s earnings but may affect it cash-flow given the timing to claim back the refund. With its current cash in hand of RM2.69 billion, Petdag should have enough financial strength to facilitate the change. On the other hand, a fixed or cheaper fuel price may encourage traffic flow which is good for sales volumes. In view of the disappointing 1QFY18 results, we trimmed financial year 2018 estimates and 2019E by 13% and 9% as we adjust: (i) volume growth to 1% and 1% from 2% and 1%, and (ii) operating margin to 4.99% and 5.23% from 5.65% and 5.65%. Post earnings revision, we cut target price to RM25.50 from RM27.85 on higher 3-year moving average of 22.9 times calendar year 2019 price-earnings-ratio (PER) of from 22.1 times previously.

In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Petronas Chemicals said revenue rose to RM4.95 billion from RM4.7 billion. \"Revenue increased by RM256 million or 5% to RM5 billion primarily driven by higher sales volumes and product prices, partially offset by the strengthening of ringgit against US dollar. EBITDA decreased by RM100 million or 5% to RM1.8 billion as the increase in sales volumes and product prices were offset by the strengthening of ringgit against US dollar and a once-off adjustment relating to under accrual of manpower-related expenses in the previous periods. \"Profit after tax was also lower by RM274 million or 20% to RM1.1 billion in line with lower EBITDA, coupled with the impact of foreign exchange loss on its shareholder loans pursuant to the divestment of 50% equity interest in a subsidiary,\" Petronas Chemicals said. Looking ahead, Petronas Chemicals said the results of the group's operations are expected to be primarily influenced by global economic conditions, foreign exchange rate movement, utilisation rate of its production facilities and petrochemical product prices. The group said petrochemical product prices have a high correlation with crude oil prices. \"The utilisation of our production facilities is dependent on plant maintenance activities and sufficient availability of feedstock as well as utilities supply.

In fact, the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) yesterday expressed optimism about the long-term prospects of the Malaysian economy under the new government. \\u201cThe EPF anticipates that any potential short-term market dips would provide opportunities for further investments in the domestic markets,\\u201d the retirement savings fund said in a statement. Meanwhile, Finance Minister-designate Lim Guan Eng sought to allay fears, saying the new government has \\u201csteady hands\\u201d to handle any market volatility. Analysts contacted by The Edge Financial Daily said that there may be little to no knee-jerk sell-off on Bursa Malaysia today as renewed demand from both local institutions and foreign investors push share prices up. Much of this optimism hinges on Dr Mahathir\\u2019s pledge to keep the stock market buoyant, saying that his administration will remain business-friendly and that \\u201cthere is no cause to devalue the ringgit\\u201d. Most market observers do not consider his words empty talk, especially with the new Council of Elders introduced on Saturday that will advise the new administration on economic and financial matters over its first 100 days. The council comprises former Bank Negara Malaysia governor Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akthar Aziz, former finance minister Tun Daim Zainuddin, former Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) president and chief executive officer Tan Sri Hassan Marican, businessman Robert Kuok Hock Nien and economist Professor Dr Jomo Kwame Sundaram. Dr Mahathir also announced Guan Eng\\u2019s appointment as finance minister, as well as Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin as home affairs minister and Mohamad Sabu as defence minister. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve been talking about a knee-jerk reaction before, but the appointment of the council is like saying \\u2018enter the dragon\\u2019. I don\\u2019t think there will be any selldown at all come Monday,\\u201d said Kenny Yee, head of research at Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd. Yee added not only will stocks linked to some of the council members\\u2019 benefit, but that most counters should prosper as the team\\u2019s expertise is expected to be a catalyst for Malaysia\\u2019s overall economic growth. Even if there is a drop in the FBM KLCI upon the opening bell, most analysts do not expect it to be sizeable. \\u201cThe index may fall between 50 and 100 points [on Monday], but it should close above 1,800 points,\\u201d according to TA Securities Holdings Bhd technical analyst Stephen Soo, who referenced the FBM KLCI\\u2019s 200-day moving average of 1,795 points. In fact, Soo believed that any intraday decline would easily be offset within the week. \\u201cThere were some undercurrents [last] Tuesday that suggested insiders may have gauged a coming rally,\\u201d he said. In fact, any dip could be a buying opportunity, Yee said. Soo shared the same view, saying, \\u201cI would be buying [on Monday],\\u201d adding that any dip would likely cause investors to experience some short-term pain, but long-term gain if they hold on to their counters. It is difficult, however, to know what the opening bell may bring. \\u201cLocals will react positively but foreigners are not going to be very happy,\\u201d shared the chief investment officer (CIO) of a local financial institution. However, he noted that local institutions are likely to provide support to the market. Foreign participation stood at 25.02% of Bursa Malaysia\\u2019s total value traded as at April 2018, according to the stock exchange\\u2019s statistics. Another supporting factor is Pakatan Harapan\\u2019s emphasis on ridding its administration of corruption, which just might do the trick in wooing foreign investors, said the CIO. \\u201cIt suits the sustainability agenda, which is big in the West,\\u201d he said, adding that an improvement in governance at the federal level could trickle down to corporations. \\u00a0 Counters to watch Stocks that could be in focus over the upcoming weeks stretch from politically linked counters and those that are heavily dependent on government contracts to the construction sector and safe-haven defensives. First to fall could be those in which the Umno has a direct stake, namely Utusan Melayu (Malaysia) Bhd (49.77%) and KUB Malaysia Bhd (52.17% held via Anchorscape Sdn Bhd). Anchorscape is partially controlled by Umno politician Datuk Abdul Rahman Mohd Redza. Star Media Group Bhd, in which the MCA is the largest shareholder (42.46%), is also on the line as only one MCA candidate, deputy president Datuk Seri\\u00a0 Dr Wee Ka Siong, retained his parliamentary seat in the 14th general election (GE14). Other politically connected stocks that may take a hit are George Kent (Malaysia) Bhd, Johan Holdings Bhd and Destini Bhd. The first two are led by Tan Sri Tan Kay Hock and third by Datuk Rozabil Abdul Rahman. Tan is said to be well known in political circles while Rozabil, who is Destini chief executive officer and largest shareholder with a 25.4% stake, is reportedly the Umno Perlis treasurer. Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd is another counter worth watching, after Tan Sri Shahrir Abdul Samad, the chairman of largest shareholder the Federal Land Development Authority, lost his parliamentary seat in Johor Baru. Meanwhile, companies with family links to politicians could also see some action. These include Petra Energy Bhd, where Datuk Mohamed Nizam Abdul Razak, brother of the former prime minister, is the non-executive director and fourth-largest shareholder (9.11%). On the other side of the fence, investors have already flocked towards Opcom Holdings Bhd, which is led by Tan Sri Mokhzani Mahathir and controlled by his brother and newly appointed Menteri Besar of Kedah Datuk Seri Mukhriz Mahathir. Share prices in Eden Inc Bhd and Thriven Global Bhd, which are linked to the son of Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, Datuk Fakhri Yassin Mahiaddin, also picked up days before the election. Meanwhile, companies linked to Kuok who controls conglomerate PPB Group Bhd (50.81%), Shangri-La Hotels (Malaysia) Bhd (23.03%) and Malaysian Bulk Carriers Bhd (with a total 48.46% stake via two separate vehicles), could also see some action. Other prominent corporate figures whose companies may be in the spotlight include Tan Sri Lee Kim Yew, chairman of Country Heights Holdings Bhd, who was among the first of corporate figures to publicly congratulate Pakatan for its victory. Tan Sri Vincent Tan and Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Al-Bulkhary are also said to be close to the new prime minister. One more company investors would be focusing on when the market opens is My EG Services Bhd (MyEG), whose earnings are heavily reliant on government contracts. A foreign research house factored in a 15% downside risk to MyEG if the goods and services tax is abolished as promised, since the group has a contract to monitor the implementation of the tax system. The loss of net profit from the non-renewal of e-government contracts is much smaller at 6%, the report said. \\u00a0 Consumer, construction, banking in focus Last Friday, CLSA Global Research, Maybank Investment Bank Research, CIMB Research, and RHB Research Institute shared positive views on the consumer sector but were cautious about the construction companies, following Pakatan\\u2019s pledge to review all mega infrastructure projects. Construction stocks will be in focus as major infrastructure projects such as the East Coast Rail Line and the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail (HSR) are expected to be reviewed by the new government. The promise to improve transparency and governance could also lead to a slower pace of investment outlays in the short- and medium term, said CIMB Research. \\u201cAmong stocks under our coverage, we believe the top losers are Gamuda Bhd (for its extensive tender exposure to mass rapid transit 3, HSR and highway concessions), YTL Corp Bhd (for its exposure to HSR and Gemas-Johor Baru rail double tracking), Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (for its exposure to HSR and Eastern Dispersal Link), Protasco Bhd (for its exposure to government road maintenance and housing projects) and IJM Corp Bhd (for its exposure to highways and rail contracts),\\u201d it said in a note last Thursday. Views were mixed on the banking sector, which has seen several counters surging to all-time highs recently. CLSA downgraded banking stocks, pending clarity on policies, and was bearish on CIMB Group Bhd in particular as it holds a \\u201cperceived link\\u201d to the Barisan Nasional administration due to group chairman Datuk Seri Nazir Razak being the brother of former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak. Moody\\u2019s Investor Service also cautioned that increasing risks of capital outflows and a further weakening of the ringgit could stress operating conditions for Malaysian banks in a last Friday note. However, a fund manager with a local insurance outfit said that the banking sector should still be supported by the fundamental factor of strong economic growth. Since the dissolution of Parliament on April 6, the FBM KLCI surged to an all-time high of 1,880.49 points on April 19, up 43.38 points from 1,837.01 points on April 6. This rise was also influenced by global factors such as commodity gains and easing trade war fears between China and the US. The benchmark index then lost as much as 2.86% to decline to 1,828.2 points on May 7, influenced by a rise in US treasury yields, before reversing to end up 1% 1,846.51 points the evening before polling day. \\u00a0"}, "60": {"date_posted": "13/5/2018", "title": "Government has steady hands to handle market jitters, says Finance Minister-designate ", "article": " GEORGE TOWN (May 13): Newly appointed Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said the new government has steady hands to handle any volatility that could affect the Malaysian stock market following Pakatan Harapan\\u2019s takeover of Putrajaya in the 14th general elections. \\u201cWe have steady hands handling this situation.

This is in line with management\\u2019s target of first gas for SK408 Phase 1 in 2019 to 2020. \\u00a0 Management had earlier provided guidance that SK408 Phase 1 will incur a net development capital expenditure (capex) of US$200 million (RM776 million) from 2018 to 2020. Additionally, similar to the previous year, Sapura Energy\\u00a0 will not increase borrowings in FY19, and shall finance the exploration and production (E&P) capex (FY18: RM890 million) internally. \\u00a0 We believe this is viable as Sapura Energy\\u2019s near-term liquidity and balance sheet (net gearing: 1.6 times) remain manageable, underpinned by healthy operating cash flows (FY18: RM1 billion; FY17: RM3.1 billion). Furthermore, FY19 cash flows are expected to receive a significant boost from SK310 B15, which started production recently in October 2017. \\u00a0 We believe the timing of this project hits a sweet spot, as it capitalises on the current low cost environment in upstream development. Meanwhile, fast forward two years later, and this project will benefit from the recovery in oil price. \\u00a0 Furthermore, Sapura Energy\\u2019s engineering and construction (E&C) fleet is currently underutilised.

Pursuant to the agreements, Sapura E&P will have a 30% interest in all five exploration permits, which will be operated by OMV.

With its previous five contracts secured earlier this year valued at some RM905 million, MIDF Amanah Investment Bank analyst Aaron Tan said the new contract is worth about RM2.1 billion. \\u201cThis is a very big contract and it is good because Sapura obviously edged out the Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineerings Holdings Bhd/Technip FMC plc (MMHE-TechnipFMC) consortium to clinch it. \\u201cBut when spread out over three years, it\\u2019s not so much. There would be an increase in the share price in the immediate short term, but what matters is its fundamentals. [Those] need to be intact,\\u201d he told The Edge Financial Daily. In the nine months ended Oct 31, 2017 (9MFY18), Sapura reported a net loss of RM217.95 million compared to RM380.64 million in net profit a year ago because of lower revenue from its drilling business, and lower share of profit from joint ventures.

The new contract was awarded to Sapura\\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, Sapura Fabrication Sdn Bhd, by Mubadala Petroleum, following a final investment decision by Mubadala Petroleum and its partners Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd and Sarawak Shell Bhd. Mubadala Petroleum is the operator of Block SK320 with a 55% interest; Petronas Carigali holds 25% and Sarawak Shell the remainder 20%.

Its managing director and group CEO Datuk Kamarul Redzuan Muhamed is optimistic that better times are ahead and that the company will achieve higher earnings. He is one of a few industry players who see the light at the end of the tunnel while most others are striving to keep their companies \\u2014 which are suffering from shrinking revenue and mounting impairments \\u2014 afloat. \\u201cThe overall sentiment has improved worldwide \\u2026 we have spoken to the big players,\\u201d Kamarul tells The Edge. \\u201cWe have seen more activities now. We have seen more jobs coming in. The contracts that we have secured in the past two years are expected to get jobs [orders].\\u201d He notes that \\u201cthere are nascent signs of recovery but not the return of the glory days\\u201d. This is not just wishful thinking on Kamarul\\u2019s part, looking at the pace the company is securing contracts. Since the start of the year, Uzma has secured six umbrella contracts from Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd \\u2014 the upstream unit of national oil firm Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas). But note that such contracts do not immediately generate revenue \\u2014 they are pending job orders from Petronas Carigali. He acknowledges that gone are the days when O&G companies enjoyed lucrative profit margins. The saving grace now is that the pressure on profit margins \\u2014 which have shrunk by one third \\u2014 has eased. \\u201cI think people are slowly realising that there\\u2019s a limit to how low the profit margin can drop,\\u201d says Kamarul. To prevent its margin from eroding, instead of bargaining hard with the oil giants that have turned highly cost-conscious, Uzma is working out solutions for its clients to save costs. \\u201cWe are looking at doing things differently to help our clients,\\u201d he explains. Thus, Uzma is not competing on price to win jobs. While most companies were downsizing and consolidating their operations, Uzma was diving into new areas to weather the storm. \\u201cWe are the first Malaysian company to go into well testing. We continue to get new contracts (from the new venture),\\u201d says Kamarul. \\u201cWe continue to build these capabilities. Every year, we have been able to add [new products]. It is not easy to do that. And I think this is what differentiates us from others. That is why we have been able to continuously grow the company.\\u201d \\u00a0 Profit margin protected It is worth noting that Uzma\\u2019s margin has actually improved, thanks to the introduction of new products. Its operating profit margin grew to 14.76% in the twelve months ended Dec 31, 2017, from 9.28% the year before. It is even higher than the 10.97% achieved in 2014 during the peak of the oil boom. But some may not be impressed with its net profit, which dipped 38.4% to RM24.23 million versus RM39.33 million in FY2016. Administrative expenses fell 16.19% to RM52.46 million from RM62.6 million previously. However, its operating expenditure more than doubled to RM54.91 million from RM21.97 million. \\u201cOur margins and operating profit growth y-o-y has been fantastic. But the pre-tax profit and all that \\u2026 are not that fantastic, simply because we have to spend money to prepare for the contracts that we have won. That offset the improvements that we got,\\u201d explains Kamarul, who expects the new contracts to start contributing in the financial year ending June 30, 2019. Uzma is changing its financial year end to June 30. There will be six financial quarters for the financial year ending June 30, 2018. \\u201cWhen things improve, this (earnings) is going to improve as well. For example, the fishing contract\\u2026 we won the contract in 2016. We were the only winner, but there weren\\u2019t any jobs (orders) until the end of 2017. \\u201cWe have hired people, built the warehouse and bought the tools for the contract. By the time we were ready to deploy, there wasn\\u2019t any job. We had spent the extra RM14 million to RM15 million in the last two quarters, which could\\u2019ve been saved, but we decided to go ahead and spend the money,\\u201d Kamarul explains. \\u00a0 The fishing service is to remove unwanted objects from the wells that disrupt the oil extracting process. \\u00a0 In the 12 months ended Dec 31, 2017, Uzma\\u2019s cost of sales declined by 33.8% to RM230.94 million, from RM348.82 million in FY2016. This boosted its gross profit by 18.4% to RM144.77 million from RM122.23 million in FY2016, although revenue dropped 20.24% to RM375.12 million \\u2014 compared with RM471.05 million in the previous corresponding period \\u2014 for a gross profit margin of 38.53%. \\u201cOur traditional business has been just like everybody else\\u2019s \\u2014 profit margins have been squeezed. But the introduction of new products like the D18 water injection and fishing contracts have improved our margins. And we made a conscious decision to get out from the low-margin businesses,\\u201d says Kamarul. \\u00a0 In the right segment Although Uzma has not emerged from the downturn unscathed, the impact has not been as severe as that as its peers \\u2014 such as offshore vessel operators and oil rig owners \\u2014 have experienced. \\u201cWe do have capex-oriented businesses like drilling, some of which were affected. We have other divisions to cushion the impact,\\u201d says Kamarul. For instance, its drilling service division provides two types of services, namely drilling new wells and servicing existing ones. When cost efficiency is the priority, he says, the cheapest way to produce oil is to extract from existing wells. \\u201cTo do that, you have to maintain the well. That brings us business. We are repairing and stimulating old wells, we do acid washes, and so on \\u2014 something that the oil giants want to do when prices are low.\\u201d Although Uzma\\u2019s jobs are more operating expenditure-driven, its share price has not been able to beat the bearish sentiment. The stock has bounced back from its multi-year low of RM1.28 in early January but it is substantially lower against the record high of RM4.14 reached in July 2014. \\u201cIt is undervalued big time. Things have changed dramatically \\u2026 we lost 60% of our market cap. Obviously, our share price is recovering, but I don\\u2019t think we are out of the woods,\\u201d says Kamarul. \\u201cOur earnings numbers have not grown much (in the past three years) but we have been able to stay profitable (even during the trough of the downturn). I would say we have done fairly well, given the circumstances,\\u201d he says. This is the most severe industry slowdown that the 45-year-old chieftain has experienced. The chill of the downturn stunned him, he says. Nonetheless, Uzma is nimble enough to adapt to the current tough operating environment, characterised by intense competition, scarce jobs and thin profit margins, Kamarul says.

The uncertainties on the home and external front have, however, overshadowed the healthy economic growth prompting investors to seek shelter in the super big-cap stocks (with market capitalisation [cap] of RM10 billion and above) that are perceived to be safe havens, and to retreat from the mid- and small-cap counters amidst liquidity concerns, in addition to earnings disappointments. \\u201cMost investors fear of missing out on the rally in the stock market in anticipation of a synchronised global growth but were also cautious about some of the uncertain news and \\u201cnoises\\u201d that are coming onto the market,\\u201d said a fund manager. The same behaviour is seen in most asset classes including the fixed-income securities as well as the latest hype in the cryptocurrencies as well, according to him. The rush to safe havens, mainly defensive counters that offer regular dividend payments, are getting pricey compared with a year ago as share prices continue to climb. The recent super big-cap stock rally on the local market has some of their yields falling below 3%, for instance Nestle (M) Bhd is at 2.1%, Public Bank Bhd (2.65%), Dutch Lady Milk Industries Bhd (1.48%) and Fraser & Neave (M) Bhd (1.81%). [see table 1] In fact, profit-taking emerged last week among some consumer stocks, like Nestle, F&N and Dutch Lady. Most notably, Nestle was reaching new all-time highs every week since January; its share price surged 55.7% until last Tuesday, only to shed 16.77% in the following three days. Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd climbed nearly 37% to its five-year high of RM20.78 last Tuesday, but slid 8.4% to end last week at RM19.04. A random check on Bloomberg data shows the current safe-haven rush is rather selected. Some of the stocks that are traditionally the defensive counters are still trading at high dividend yields. Interestingly, the defensive darling British American Tobacco (M) Bhd stands out in terms of dividend yield. The tobacco stock is trading at a dividend yield of 6.1%, no thanks to the decline in the share price in the past three years. Besides, the real estate investment trust (REIT) is much higher than the fixed deposit rates rising to above 6% too. YTL Hospitality REIT's yield is at 7.24%, MRCB Quill REIT (7.7%), IGB REIT 6.53% and Pavilion REIT (6.11%). \\u00a0 Why the defensive rush? Inter-Pacific Securities Sdn Bhd head of research Pong Teng Siew pointed out that due to a lack of choice for defensive stocks, investors have been flocking to only these handful of big-cap stocks, pushing some stocks to be overvalued. \\u201cI partially blame this [cautious sentiment] on the overly enthusiastic forecast for the stock market in 2018. Many analysts anticipated a bull market throughout the year. That was why we saw some excitement in January. But investors were caught by surprise in February when the US market plunged, and that has left a nervous market sentiment until now,\\u201d Pong said when asked about the reason for the surge in interest in large-cap stocks. \\u201cAt this point, it is an issue of valuation. Investors retrieved certain defensive stocks whose prices have stretched beyond what is justifiable. This is not sustainable,\\u201d commented Pong. The lower dividend yield will soon result in waning interest as they become unattractive, he added. MIDF head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman, however, reckons that the soaring share price of these defensive stocks may not deter buying interest as investors who buy into dividend yield stocks usually have a long-term investment horizon. Mohd Redza noted that the low liquidity of these companies is a sign that these stocks are not fuelled by short-term trading interest. \\u201cNestle and Dutch Lady, for example, have an average 2018 monthly velocity of 14% and 19% respectively. Among the big-cap stocks, only F&N, KLK (Kuala Lumpur Kepang Bhd), Petronas Dagangan (Petronas Dagangan Bhd) and Public Bank have higher average velocity at 28%, 28%, 26% and 33% respectively,\\u201d he said. In contrast, Areca Capital Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Danny Wong Teck Meng does not quite agree that defensive stocks should be the investment choice now simply because he believes that most uncertainties were triggered by external factors that are relatively insignificant to Malaysia\\u2019s corporate performance. \\u201cAlthough there were some disappointments following the results season for the fourth quarter of 2017, I believe that most companies are still fundamentally strong,\\u201d Wong said, pointing out that the steel tariff imposed by the US President Donald Trump is expected to have minimal impact on the local steel industry. Furthermore, Wong stressed that there is no indication a market crash is on the horizon, so the fears are quite misplaced. He did not agree with defensive strategy, instead he opines that investors should focus on the fundamentals of each individual company, rather than a blanket strategy of rushing to the defensive consumer counters although some of their valuations are already stretched. He noted that the external risks have provided a cue for investors to take profits."}, "82": {"date_posted": "16/3/2018", "title": "PMB Investment eyes O&G in 2018", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: Oil and gas (O&G) and construction are the sectoral themes for PMB Investment Bhd\\u2019s equity investment strategy this year, amid improving prospects underscored by Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u2019s (Petronas) significantly higher earnings last year.

PMB expects the stock market to stabilise in the second half after GE14 with an upward bias. \\u201cBased on our observation, over the last five GEs, only once did the market decline [immediately] post-election,\\u201d Najmi observed. PMB is projecting a year-end target of 1,900-1,920 for the FBM KLCI. The fund management company plans to launch its first international unit trust fund \\u2014 called PMB ASEAN Star \\u2014 in the second quarter of the year and is targeting an initial US$30-US$50 million. Because of its greater liquidity, the fund intends to target Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines for starters. Although other countries such as Vietnam have syariah-compliant equities, Najmi said, \\u201cthe value is small, making it inconvenient for trade.\\u201d Excluding the upcoming ASEAN Star, PMB manages 14 unit trust funds, two wholesale funds and several other portfolio mandates, all of which are invested locally.

PMB also announced the performance of five of its best funds under management, with a rate of return ranging between 23% and 33% for the year ended Dec 31, led by PMB Shariah Small-Cap Fund and PMB Shariah Growth Fund.

Our neighbour, Singapore, too has its own woes and \\u2026 fines. When it comes to fiscal discipline, however, Malaysia has much to learn from the city state. It is easy to dismiss Singapore \\u2014 with a land mass of 721.5 sq km and population of 5.6 million \\u2014 as a much easier place to govern. By comparison, Penang island is 299 sq km and has a population of about 750,000. Including Seberang Perai, the state has a land mass that is 45% larger than Singapore\\u2019s but a population of only 1.75 million or just under a third of the city state\\u2019s. The latter means that Singapore needs to be highly efficient and creative when it comes to land use and future-proofing its economy to remain a respected and highly developed independent nation. Unlike Malaysia, which is blessed with an abundance of natural resources, Singapore has very good reason to be kiasu and kiasi \\u2014 the colloquial speak for being afraid of losing out (overly competitive) and being afraid of doing something wrong (premature death). Singapore, which separated from Malaysia in August 1965 and still buys water from our country, achieved self-reliance in water in 2016 even as supply in several states here was hit by drought. And even as Malaysia racked up debt of over RM687 billion by spending more than we earn \\u2014 during both the good times and the tough times the past two decades \\u2014 Singapore prudently accumulated reserves from its budget surpluses as well as its ability to invest and grow its war chest (a secret number of over S$1 trillion [RM2.96 trillion]). Singapore\\u2019s annual budget began enjoying what it calls a Net Investment Return Contribution (NIRC) from 2000, government data shows. Apart from up to 50% of net investment returns from GIC Pte Ltd, Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore\\u2019s NIRC also comprises up to 50% of net investment income from past reserves and remaining net assets. What was a mere S$2.29 billion (1.4% of gross domestic product) at the turn of the millennium grew to S$7.35 billion (2.2% of GDP) in 2010 and reached S$14.61 billion last year. Now the largest contributor to Singapore\\u2019s budget, the NIRC is expected to reach a new all-time high of S$15.85 billion or 3.4% of GDP this year, which covers nearly 20% of government expenditure. \\u201cSingapore has self-imposed strict fiscal rules to prevent the government from spending beyond its means,\\u201d says Chua Hak Bin, senior economist at Maybank Kim Eng Research. \\u201cFirst, the Singapore government cannot run a fiscal deficit (it must be balanced or surplus) over each term of government (within each electoral cycle). Second, Singapore sets aside all land sales into reserves, which are then invested to generate future returns. For FY2017, land sales amounted to S$12.9 billion, a considerable sum,\\u201d he adds, relating how proceeds from land sales in Hong Kong flow directly into budget revenue and are spent. \\u201cThird, only up to half of the net investment return from reserves (with GIC, Temasek and MAS) can be drawn upon for the budget. The rest will be ploughed back into reserves and reinvested,\\u201d says Chua, who reckons that Malaysia \\u201cwill be hard-pressed to adhere to a balanced budget rule, given rising spending needs and sensitivity of fiscal revenue to energy prices\\u201d despite a broadened revenue base. Singapore had tapped on past reserves (US$4.5 billion during the 2008 global financial crisis) but special permission from the president \\u2014 not the prime minister \\u2014 is necessary. The government also does not borrow to fund its annual budget and has no net debt, according to data on its Ministry of Finance\\u2019s website. \\u201c[Malaysia] ran a budget deficit for the last 20 years, hence the lack of reserves for investment to have an NIRC \\u2026 The amount contributed by Khazanah [Nasional Bhd] in terms of dividend is relatively small by comparison,\\u201d another seasoned economist surmises. Khazanah paid RM500 million in dividend in 2016 and RM1 billion last year while Bank Negara Malaysia paid RM3 billion in dividend in 2016 and RM2.5 billion last year, official data shows. National oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) paid RM16 billion in 2016 and 2017 and has committed to pay RM19 billion this year. \\u201cA strategic case can be made that some proportion of Petronas\\u2019 dividends should be set aside and accumulated in a sovereign wealth fund, which is to be invested in external assets. Recycling Malaysia\\u2019s oil profits and reserves into more oil and gas and domestic assets only concentrates the investment risk on Malaysia\\u2019s economic cycle, oil prices and the ringgit [and the] purpose of setting reserves aside is so that the government can tap on these funds when there is a sharp economic downturn, which often coincides with a collapse in the ringgit or oil prices,\\u201d says Chua. \\u201cThe ideal type of fiscal reserves should, therefore, not be correlated with Malaysia\\u2019s economic or stock market cycle, oil prices or the ringgit. It is an insurance against a crisis.\\u201d As it is, dividends from Petronas, Bank Negara and Khazanah form part of the interest and returns on investment under the federal government\\u2019s non-tax revenue but their contributions pale in comparison with debt service charges of RM26.48 billion in 2016, RM28.87 billion in 2017 and the RM30.88 billion expected for 2018. \\u201cWhile the Malaysian government has committed to fiscal discipline and the progressive reduction in fiscal deficit, there is a general lack of political will to bring its high operating expenditure down to a more manageable level. A bloated civil servant population, high expenditure on their remunerations and a pension scheme that is unsustainable are examples. While efforts have been made to cut subsidies, it appears to have found its way back gradually to the government budget,\\u201d the seasoned economist laments. \\u00a0 How can the government budget better? \\u201c[Malaysia needs to] contain the civil servant population, focus on the productivity and efficiency of government services, restructure the pension scheme to one that is self-sustaining, implement a transparent open tender system of awarding government contracts and optimise government revenue by removing duplicating incentives (that would also cut down abuses),\\u201d says the seasoned economist. While Singapore\\u2019s decision to raise the Goods and Services Tax (GST) by 2% to 9% by 2021 would provide Malaysia with headroom to move its 6% rate higher, economists reckon that the government still needs to manage its finances better by bringing down operating expenditure and leaving room for more development spending (without relying on debt) to grow the economy. \\u201cThe ability to bring about higher labour productivity and income for the population that translates into higher standards of living is important. Otherwise, the rising cost of living would be a real constraint on the low to middle-income groups \\u2026 The other factor to consider is the ability to bring profiteering of traders under better control so that it does not spill over into higher inflation unnecessarily,\\u201d the economist says. That\\u2019s important given that our government \\u201cmay have to plan and prepare for growing liabilities from public-sector pensions and healthcare spending from an ageing demographic (which fortunately, comes at a later time for Malaysia versus Singapore or Thailand), as the existing fiscal revenue sources will likely not be sufficient\\u201d, says Chua, who reckons that the Malaysian government \\u201cmay have to look into future and new revenue sources to finance these needs\\u201d. He believes that Malaysia \\u201cmay want to see how it can consolidate and reduce the number of exemptions within the GST framework first [as well as on e-commerce goods and imported services] before raising the GST. Otherwise, consumers will be even more tempted to switch to internet shopping to escape the GST net\\u201d. Noting that Singapore has been introducing more \\u201cwealth taxes\\u201d on property and personal income to make the overall system more progressive and to fund social transfers to the lower income group, Chua reckons that Malaysia may also want to make the property tax system \\u201cmore progressive\\u201d to bolster its revenue options or sell land to bolster its reserves. \\u201cLand is, however, also a state matter and often the main revenue source for some states. Rights over the proceeds from land sales may, therefore, not be as straightforward as Singapore\\u2019s case. \\u201cSingapore\\u2019s strong fiscal standing has earned the government an AAA credit rating (which is shrinking in terms of the number of qualified countries) and strengthened the Singapore dollar over the years. Strengthening Malaysia\\u2019s fiscal and savings discipline would also raise Malaysia\\u2019s credit standing and the ringgit\\u2019s longer-term resilience,\\u201d says Chua. Malaysia\\u2019s self-imposed 55% debt-to-GDP ceiling and zero deficit targets will lead to some discipline but he reckons \\u201cfurther fiscal discipline might be necessary to keep government guarantees and borrowings via government-linked entities in check\\u201d. \\u00a0 Building a case for the future \\u201cThe Malaysian government has made significant progress so far in the rationalisation of its expenditure. Further efforts in rationalising expenditure would be helpful, such as making subsidies more targeted, right-sizing the civil service and improving healthcare, education and transport service cost recovery,\\u201d says AMRO (Asean + 3 Macroeconomic Research Office) chief economist Khor Hoe Ee, who notes how Singapore\\u2019s government has managed to anticipate the large increases in the coming years and \\u201chas the resources to tackle the challenge\\u201d of ageing and technological changes. \\u201cThe past few [Singapore] budgets in particular have put great emphasis on ageing-related spending, with more financial support for senior citizens, such as the Silver Support Scheme and the Pioneer Generation Package. They have also provided all residents with Medishield Life with universal coverage \\u2026 In terms of labour shortage due to the ageing population, the government is also looking for ways to reduce man\\u00adpower demand, while enabling older workers to continue to contribute to the society meaningfully \\u2026 In the past few years, each of Singapore\\u2019s annual budgets was built on the previous budgets to embrace technological changes,\\u201d Khor adds. It would seem that a bit more kiasuism may be necessary this side of the Causeway. Freedom from a persistent budget deficit would allow Malaysia\\u2019s attention to move further, beyond covering operating expenses and immediate needs to focus more on catering for impending structural changes and the future needs of the people and the economy. \\u00a0  Click / Tap image to enlarge \\u00a0"}, "84": {"date_posted": "15/3/2018", "title": "PMB Investment eyes O&G in 2018", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (March 15): Oil and gas (O&G) and construction are the sectorial themes for PMB Investment Bhd's equity investment strategy this year, amid improving prospects underscored by Petroliam Nasional Bhd's (Petronas) significantly higher earnings last year.

Malaysia, which derived 41% of its revenue from oil in 2009, has now reduced that dependence to 14% this year. The low oil price environment that started in mid-2014 led national oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) to undertake cost-optimisation measures in 2016, which included reducing its capex and opex by RM50 billion over four years, from 2016 till 2020.

Dayang\\u2019s current order book stands at RM3.415 billion, with long-term contracts ranging from two to five years. \\u201cThe company is also in the midst of increasing its order book, currently participating in RM8 billion worth of tenders,\\u201d says Tan. MIDF has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on Dayang with a target price of 95 sen per share, premised on a large potential share price upside, earnings upward cycle for FY2018, an improving oil and gas industry climate with higher activity levels, improving utilisation rate as well as improving conditions for Perdana Petroleum. \\u00a0 Yinson Holdings Bhd Yinson is the world\\u2019s sixth largest floating production storage offloading (FPSO) service provider. A recovery in the oil and gas sector, especially upstream, could see Yinson getting more contracts for its FPSOs. UOB Kay Hian analyst Kong Ho Meng in a Jan 30 note on the counter maintained his \\u201cbuy\\u201d call, with an upgraded target price of RM4.80 from RM4.40 previously. \\u201cOur sum of total parts-based target price is mostly based on discounted cash flow on the FPSO divisions and implies a forward FY2020 price earnings of 18 times.\\u201d \\u201cFor FY2019, Yinson may secure [the FPSO contract for the] Layang [field] and one new mega FPSO contract. Our valuation factors in new contract catalysts, namely 39 sen per share estimate for FPSO Layang, and the option value of 77 sen per share for a mega contract win. \\u201cEven though we have raised our target price as our earlier option value assumed a 40% chance of a mid-sized contract win, we remain conservative on the win chance because of competition from other strong FPSO contenders,\\u201d he writes. \\u00a0 Petronas Dagangan Bhd Petronas Dagangan (PetDag) operates petrol stations and sells downstream oil and gas products. MIDF\\u2019s Tan believes for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2017 (4QFY2017), PetDag\\u2019s normalised earnings \\u2014 excluding its disposals \\u2014 will most likely outpace the firm\\u2019s expectations by 5%. This, he says, is premised on the higher average RON95 price of RM2.26 per litre in 4QFY2017 compared with RM2.10 per litre in 3QFY2017 and\\u00a0 the appreciation of Brent crude oil prices . \\u201cIn addition to the expected commendable earnings, we believe that there could potentially be a special dividend or higher final dividend. The three cumulative dividends declared for FY2017 amounted to 48 sen per share. \\u201cWe believe that there could be an additional 35 sen to 40 sen declared, bringing the total dividend declared to 83 sen to 88 sen per share, with a payout exceeding 80%. This is a result of a large gain on disposal \\u2014 from the disposals of a 100% stake in Petronas Energy Philippines Inc\\u00a0 and 40% equity interest in Duta Inc \\u2014 recorded in 3QFY2017,\\u201d he says. MIDF has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on PetDag with an unchanged target price of RM28 per share. \\u00a0 Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd Serba Dinamik is an engineering solutions service provider for the oil and gas industry and stands to benefit from more operation and maintenance jobs, given its international exposure. Most of its jobs are currently in the Middle East. UOB Kay Hian\\u2019s Kong maintains his \\u201cbuy\\u201d call and target price of RM3.80 in a Feb 6 note on the company. \\u201cThis is pegged to 12 times 2019 forward price earnings, at a premium to local smaller peer Deleum Bhd, given Serba\\u2019s superior diversification, earnings compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% to 36% and return on equity (ROE) of 24%. \\u201cWe continue to like its high growth strategies and believe that an earnings rerating will drive share price upside. We retain our target price for now pending its results announcement at the end of February,\\u201d he writes. \\u201cHowever, we highlighted that in a blue sky scenario, in which we assume the company will close 2018 with an order book of RM7.5 billion \\u2014 implying new order wins exceeding RM3 billion \\u2014 our earnings forecasts could be adjusted upwards by 16%, and target price to RM4.40,\\u201d he says. \\u00a0 Sapura Energy Bhd Sapura Energy is an integrated oil and gas services and solutions provider. It is engaged in providing end-to-end solutions and services to the upstream petroleum industry. In a Feb 6 note on the counter, AmInvestment Bank analyst Alex Goh says even though the pace of offshore projects remains tepid globally, the group\\u2019s order book still translates into 2.2 times forward financial year ending Jan 31, 2019 (FY2019F) revenue, with management hopeful of further wins from tender prospects worth up to US$9.5 billion. \\u201cThe stock currently trades at an attractive 0.3 times FY2018F book value vs 0.9 times for Bumi Armada Bhd and 0.5 times for Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd,\\u201d he says. Goh notes that Sapura\\u2019s last major award announcement was for multiple contracts worth RM1.5 billion on Nov 15 last year, while its FY2018 contract awards totalled RM3.7 billion compared with AmInvestment\\u2019s assumption of RM6 billion. AmInvestment has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on Sapura Energy with a fair value of RM1. \\u00a0 \\u00a0"}, "88": {"date_posted": "2/3/2018", "title": "More rig-contract wins anticipated for UMW Oil & Gas Corp", "article": " UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd\n(March 1, 31 sen)\nMaintain buy with a target price of 44 sen: UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd (UMW-OG) incurred RM982 million asset impairment loss in fourth quarter of financial year 2017 (4QFY17) due to change in daily charter rate (DCR) assumption and weighted average cost of capital. The reasons for change in assumptions were due to slower-than-expected recovery in DCR and change in capital structure of the company post rights issue. Year-to-date rig utilisation rate improved from 21% in FY16 to 70% in FY17 on the back of stabilisation of crude oil prices due to Opec production cut. However, we expect rig utilisation rate to fall to about 60% in 1QFY18 as Naga 2 is warm stacked and Naga 4 is undergoing special periodical survey and will only start its contract from 2QFY18 onwards. Nevertheless, we understand that management is targeting rig utilisation rate in FY18 to at least match the level in FY17. More than 50% of the global rigs are aged more than 30 years, indicating that a significant number of rigs could be scrapped in the longer run and provide significant boast to the DCR. For FY18, we understand that at least 12 jack-up rig contracts are available for tender in Malaysia. This is positive for UMW-OG being one of the only two local players in the industry, the company stands a fairly good chance to secure a sufficient amount of contracts to replenish its order book. At this juncture, the group is participating in 33 rig contract bids (of which 21 are in Malaysia) worth a total of US$812 million (RM3.19 billion), indicating potential more rig-contract wins by the group. Following latest outstanding quarterly results, we opine that earnings outlook of the company has improved significantly and UMW-OG is a major beneficiary of steady jack-up rig demand by Petronas Group given its role as the largest domestic jack-up rig owner.

It is understood that talks between Khazanah Nasional Bhd\\u2019s dual-listed healthcare company and the national oil company are ongoing and that a deal may be struck soon. Petronas declined comment while an IHH spokesperson\\u2019s emailed response was: \\u201cIHH is always looking at various value-accretive opportunities. However, it is not appropriate for us to comment on specific transactions and we will update the market if there are any material developments.\\u201d A source familiar with the deal says, \\u201cYes, they (IHH and Petronas) are in talks. Prince Court \\u2014 or healthcare \\u2014 is not Petronas\\u2019 core business, so it makes sense for them to divest it. And who better to buy it than IHH?\\u201d Another source says the two government-linked companies have been in talks but that the matter is being kept under wraps. Prince Court, a 270-bed private healthcare facility in the heart of Kuala Lumpur, was set up in late 2007 at a cost of RM544 million. For Petronas, a chance to offload Prince Court would bring to an end what looks like an arduous journey from the construction phase. Many would remember how Peremba Construction Sdn Bhd secured a RM357 million contract to build the hospital in September 2002 but failed to do the job even after being given an extension. The contract was terminated in October 2006. Later the same year, Sunway Construction Sdn Bhd was awarded a RM391 million contract to build the medical centre, which it did successfully. The hospital commenced operations in late 2007. However, it was not a straight road from there. As at end-December 2011, Prince Court had reportedly accumulated losses of RM1.08 billion and had not registered a single profitable financial year since its inception. In its financial year ended Dec 31, 2016, the company suffered an after-tax loss of RM4.01 million on revenue of RM211.29 million. Accumulated losses carried forward stood at RM1.42 billion. The medical treatment facility had short-term debt commitments of RM72.39 million and long-term borrowings of RM30 million as at end-2016. On the other side of the balance sheet, it had current assets of RM123.35 million and non-current assets of RM411.98 million. In 2010, there were rumours of a purported sale by Petronas but these were brushed aside by the then president and CEO Tan Sri Shamsul Azhar Abbas. \\u201cWe will not sell Prince Court \\u2026 the medical centre does not have any problems,\\u201d he said at the time. Oil prices averaged just a little more than US$71 in 2010 and about US$87 and US$86 in 2011 and 2012 respectively. With Brent crude averaging US$53 last year, the operating environment has changed drastically and could have nudged Petronas into selling this non-core asset. Company executives have indicated high operating costs as the reason for the red ink at the respectable medical centre. It is understood that the company once had a workforce of 1,100 but has reduced it to 800 now. In mid-2010, it was reported that three of its top officials, including CEO Stuart Rowley, were being investigated in a \\u201croutine audit review\\u201d. Rowley resigned shortly after. In a nutshell, Prince Court has had several episodes that would likely have vexed even the coolest of heads at Petronas. IHH, in contrast, has been doing rather well. It is 41.12%-controlled by state-owned investment arm Khazanah and is dual-listed on Bursa Malaysia and the Singapore Exchange. The medical service provider has a presence in Malaysia, Singapore, Turkey, India, China, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa with more than 10 ,000 beds in 50 hospitals across 10 countries. Some of the brands in IHH\\u2019s stable are Mount Elizabeth, Gleneagles, Pantai, Parkway and Acibadem. In its nine months ended September 2017, IHH registered a net profit of RM868.7 million on revenue of RM8.26 billion. In contrast to the previous corresponding period, net profit was up by a third while revenue was almost 12% higher. The company\\u2019s earnings per share for the nine months stood at 10.35 sen. Since early December last year, IHH\\u2019s stock has gained more than 7% or more than 40 sen. It closed at RM6.02 last Thursday, giving the company a market capitalisation of RM49.6 billion. As at end-September last year, IHH had cash and cash equivalents of RM5.83 billion while on the other side of the balance sheet, it had short-term borrowings of RM6.59 billion and long-term debt commitments of RM578.53 million. Its balance sheet would have no problem with an acquisition the size of Prince Court. Other than Khazanah, IHH\\u2019s shareholders include the well-diversified Japanese giant Mitsui & Co with an 18.03% stake and the Employees Provident Fund (8.43%). \\u00a0"}, "95": {"date_posted": "5/2/2018", "title": "KLCI pulls back after Wall Street's Friday slump", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 5): The local stock market started the trading week on a cautious note following the slump on Wall Street last Friday caused by rising expectation of a rate hike in the US occurring sooner than later.

The oil and gas (O&G) and banking sectors plus some export-oriented stocks were the selling targets. At the noon break, the benchmark index recouped some losses to close at 1,853.38 points, a decline of 0.9% or 17.1 points. Only 102 counters on Bursa Malaysia managed to buck the downtrend to stay in positive territory as of noon break. Decliners led gainers by 975 to 102 with the remaining 231 counters traded unchanged. Trading volume stood at 1.5 billion units worth RM1.31 billion. Among the top gainers are some of the consumer names such as Nestle (M) Bhd, Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd, Heineken Malaysia Bhd, Dutch Lady Milk Industries Bhd and the domestic marketing arm of Petronas, Petronas Dagangan Bhd. The top losers include KESM Industries Bhd, United Plantations Bhd, British American Tobacco (Malaysia) Bhd, Hengyuan Refining Co Bhd and Petron Malaysia Refining & Marketing Bhd. The most active counters are dominated by O&G-related counters such as Hibiscus Petroleum Bhd, Sapura Energy Bhd, Sumatec Resources Bhd, UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd and budget airline operator, AirAsia X Bhd. Hong Leong Investment Bank's head of retail research, Loui Low told theedgemarkets.com that the cautious sentiment has led to the decline seen in the market. \"The pullback is just a reaction to the selldown seen in the US on Friday. From a technical point of view, we see some consolidation in the index to between the 1,830 and 1,850 level as we approached the Chinese New Year,\" Low said. He added that the small caps are the biggest losers so far as the decline was already seen since a week ago. Malacca Securities Sdn Bhd has expected a meaningful consolidation for the FBM KLCI. \"We think a meaningful consolidation could lead the FBM KLCI back to the 1,820-1,850 levels, which would allow the key index to take a breather after the strong recent gains and to build up a base for another run later,\" it said.

At 3.20pm, UMW-OG slid 2 sen or 4.94% to 38.5 sen, with some 104.6 million shares exchanged. The counter previously saw a rally in late December 2017 up to earlier this month, to touch a six-month closing high of 45.5 sen, spurred by the climb in crude oil prices to above the US$65 per barrel mark. At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at US$69.14 per barrel according to Bloomberg data. In a note today, AmInvestment analyst Alex Goh said the counter was downgraded as its share price had rebounded above the research house's target price of 30 sen per share, based on a 40% discount to its diluted book value of 50 sen per share. Goh said he does not expect any near-term re-rating for UMW-OG, as even at full rig utilisation at current day rates, the company will be barely breaking even, notwithstanding the group's efforts to draw cost efficiencies with a stronger credit profile amongst suppliers and financiers. While Goh said there may be 12 rig charters materialising for the company in 2018 \\u2014 compared to five in 2017 \\u2014 he said these may be short-term charters to replace contracts expiring in 2018. \"Even at near full rig utilisation of 90% in 3QFY17, UMW-OG still suffered a minor core loss of RM4 million. As there will be three rigs out of charter in 1QFY18 or utilisation rate of 60%, we expect a resumption of losses for the group. \"Given that the group will incur one-off recapitalisation and rig impairment costs in 4QFY17 amid persistent losses against the backdrop of jack-up charter rates which are just about breaking even, we view the 19% share price discount to its estimated diluted book value as too low,\" Goh added. On UMW-OG's announcement yesterday that it has secured a three-year umbrella contract from Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd for the provision of hydraulic workover units (HWU), Goh noted that there has not been any call-out or work order under the contract that commenced on Dec 22, which will be made at stipulated price, for those HWU services. The contract, which involves maintenance and remedial treatments for an oil or gas well, may comprise a series of individual orders with a term of three years with a one-year extension option. \"Currently, HWUs represent a minor part of the group's asset base and currently register losses for the group given that the HWUs are largely idle over the past year.

The blacklist excludes its unit, THHE Fabricators Sdn Bhd (TFab), from being a main contractor for Petronas\\u2019 major fabrication works. \\u201cWe\\u2019re looking at certain projects in India and the Middle East, particularly in Qatar,\\u201d its chief executive officer Suhaimi Badrul Jamil told The Edge Financial Daily recently. Its entry into these markets is likely to take the form of a joint venture (JV), he said, whereas THHE would focus on its pivot towards shipbuilding and ship repairs in Malaysia in the meantime. \\u201cFor ship repairs, we are in talks for one (project) with a government subsidiary, while another one is commercial,\\u201d said Suhaimi, although he declined to share the value of these projects as discussions are still at a preliminary stage. As for shipbuilding, the company is currently involved in building three offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) for the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) via its JV with Destini Bhd. THHE owns a 49% stake in the JV company, THHE Destini Sdn Bhd, which had earlier this year received the RM738.9 million OPV contract from MMEA. Building of the ships commenced in mid-December last year at THHE\\u2019s fabrication yard in Pulau Indah, following a keel-laying ceremony. The same fabrication yard, which stretches 56.79 acres (22.98ha), is THHE\\u2019s only property, according to its 2016 annual report. Meanwhile, Suhaimi said he is not overly concerned about the group missing out on jobs from Petronas, as THHE did not expect any jobs from the national oil firm due to the gap between industry supply for fabrication works and Petronas\\u2019 demand. \\u201cIf you look at the high side estimates from Petronas, there are only around 10,000 tonnes worth of jobs. Comparatively, the capacity of our yard is about 20,000 tonnes, while the capacity of Malaysia\\u2019s fabrication industry is about 400,000 tonnes in total,\\u201d he said. On top of that, most of the jobs offered by Petronas are in Sarawak and will have to be performed by yards in that state, he said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why we are diversifying away from oil and gas to focus more on shipbuilding and ship repairs,\\u201d said Suhaimi, who is also the group\\u2019s chief financial officer. The move is part of THHE\\u2019s turnaround plans, which has so far seen it receive support from a majority of its creditors for its scheme of arrangement. \\u201cWith the recent approvals from our creditors, we\\u2019re about 70% of the way there in terms of financial restructuring,\\u201d Suhaimi said. On Dec 18, the group announced that all of its secured creditors and 94.5% of its unsecured creditors had backed the group\\u2019s scheme of arrangement at its court convened meeting. Two out of three of THHE\\u2019s subsidiaries, namely TFab and O&G Works Sdn Bhd had also received sufficient support from its creditors. However, its 70%-owned THHE Offshore Services Sdn Bhd saw 81.33% of unsecured creditors voting against the scheme. Suhaimi said the development at THHE Offshore won\\u2019t have any effect on the scheme as the latter is not a major subsidiary. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s important is that we received an overwhelming majority for THHE and TFab,\\u201d he added. THHE has consistently posted net losses every quarter since the beginning of its 2014 financial year. For the nine months ended Sept 30 (9MFY17), the group posted a cumulative net loss of RM70.13 million, significantly lower than the RM171.93 million net loss it posted in the previous year, when it booked a one-off loss on disposal amounting to RM56.3 million. Still, revenue for 9MFY17 declined 61.55% to RM5.05 million from RM13.12 million a year ago on lower offshore crane works and other income. THHE\\u2019s plan to bid for fabrication jobs in India would not be the first time it is eyeing India for expansion. In April 2011, it signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Indian company SEW Infrastructure Ltd to jointly bid for similar jobs. At the time, THHE was listed as Ramunia Holdings Bhd. However, after the partners failed to jointly secure a contract from India\\u2019s Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd (ONGC), the MoU was mutually terminated in June 2012. As Ramunia, the group was also previously blacklisted for two years by ONGC in 2009 over issues related to a US$685 million field development job. Shares in THHE closed one sen or 9.5% higher at 11.5 sen last Friday, giving the group a market capitalisation of RM128.94 million.

", "article": " MALAYSIA\\u2019S aviation industry continued to watch in disbelief as the national airline lost another CEO this year. Peter Bellew, who took the helm at Malaysia Airlines Bhd (MAB) on July 1, 2016, following a one-year stint as its chief operations officer, resigned in October. He was the third CEO to step down in less than three years, following the departures of Christoph Mueller and Ahmad Jauhari Yahya. Bellew was also the airline\\u2019s second non-Malaysian CEO and managing director after Mueller. Bellew\\u2019s sudden departure raised questions as to what really goes on behind the closed doors of Khazanah Nasional Bhd\\u2019s office at the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur \\u2014 Khazanah being the sole shareholder of MAB. This is because Bellew\\u2019s resignation was not announced properly to the public. In fact, London-listed Ryanair Holdings plc let the cat out of the bag in its stock exchange filing when it announced the appointment of Bellew as the low-cost carrier\\u2019s new chief operating officer (COO). Indeed, Khazanah\\u2019s initial response to the media indicated that it was also unaware of Bellew\\u2019s decision. In a statement issued on Oct 17, it said it was caught off guard by the announcement that Bellew would be returning to the Irish airline. Bellew was not forthcoming either. About three weeks before resigning, he had expressed his commitment to MAB. Talk surfaced that Khazanah\\u2019s meddling in the decision to acquire or lease a new fleet of wide-body aircraft led to Bellew\\u2019s resignation. The sovereign wealth fund denied the talk and refuted an article in an English daily about the purported meddling. Now, a new CEO is in the hot seat. Captain Izham Ismail, a career aviation man with more than 30 years of experience, was appointed just three days after Bellew\\u2019s departure. Will he stay?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Peter Bellew CEO, Malaysia Airlines Bhd\\u00a0\n(June 2016 to October 2017) The position as the CEO of a beleaguered legacy airline is not something that many people would want to take, but Bellew was pushed into the spotlight after his predecessor Mueller resigned after about a year at the helm. Bellew carried on Khazanah Nasional Bhd\\u2019s 12-point recovery plan for MAB, which aimed to return the national carrier to profitability by end-2017 and undergo a relisting by 2020. Bellew was confident of turning around MAB. After all, he had been making announcements periodically about the airline\\u2019s operational performance from the get-go, telling the world that the transformation of the group was on track. However, things at MAB started to get controversial when the airline went to the US as part of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak\\u2019s state visit to the White House in September. During the visit, in which Najib famously proclaimed the Malaysian government\\u2019s intention to help strengthen the US economy, Bellew signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Boeing for the purchase of eight Boeing 787 Dreamliners, a wide-body aircraft, in a deal that was worth US$2.5 billion (RM10.2 billion). The media started to treat the MoU as if it were a firm order by MAB, which the airline later denied. It stressed that it had only entered into firm orders for 25 Boeing 737 MAX, while other arrangements were only to allow the group to be flexible in making decisions about its fleet replacement and expansion programme. Had MAB firmed up the MoU and ordered eight Dreamliners, it would have more than doubled its long-haul, wide-body fleet, which consists of six Airbus A350 XWBs. This would mean a diversion from the earlier vision, which was for MAB to become an airline with extensive regional networks, rather than intercontinental. Following the brouhaha in regard to the \\u201cpurchase\\u201d of eight Dreamliners, rumours started to swirl among industry players and observers that Bellew was under pressure to sign the MoU by certain parties, to make the visit to the White House more impactful. There was even an article in a local daily saying that Bellew\\u2019s departure was due to Khazanah\\u2019s interference in the running of MAB, \\u00a0which Khazanah strongly denied. What is interesting in the way Bellew left MAB is the press conference that came with it. Bellew had called for a press conference to explain why he had resigned from MAB, citing his love for Ireland as the main reason for his departure. More interesting was how Bellew went on to criticise Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad during the press conference, after the former prime minister alleged that the Irish man quit MAB because of the government\\u2019s meddling. \\u00a0 Captain Izham Ismail CEO, Malaysia Airlines Bhd The man who was appointed to succeed Bellew is not really new to MAB. After all, he started his career in the aviation industry in 1979, with the then Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS). In the current airline group form, Izham was the COO from Sept 1, 2016, and played an integral role in the ongoing execution of the turnaround plan. However, to the Malaysian public, he is the new kid on the block. What is he made of? Will he be able to steer MAB to sustainable profitability through professional management practices? Besides being a seasoned pilot, Izham\\u2019s management skill was first cultivated when he joined MAS\\u2019 flight operations management team in the 1990s. His major accomplishments include leading the Y2K Air Operations for the Flight Operations Division of MAS, as well as leading the division for the introduction of the Airbus A330-300 and the Boeing 777-200 to service. His areas of expertise include managing projects related to flight operations, and planning and managing fleet operations and training requirements. His first senior position in MAS came in 2012, when he was appointed director of operations and, later, senior vice-president of operations and development. Under the leadership of Mueller, Izham was appointed head of the operations programme management office, overseeing more than 100 projects, which were key to the turnaround of MAS. He is also one of the directors of MAB Kargo, and the CEO of MASwings. His vast experience, from pilot to flight operations and management to air freight, gives Izham all the required knowledge to keep MAB on the right course. Commenting about his appointment to the top post of MAB, Izham says it is both an honour and a big responsibility. He is looking forward to making the national airline the pride of the nation again. With both Mueller and Bellew putting MAB on track to soar again, it is, therefore, a huge responsibility for Izham to ensure that the national airline does not go off course. Can he do that and will Khazanah, being the sole shareholder of MAB, give him the necessary support to steer the national airline forward? The whole nation is watching. \\u00a0"}, "113": {"date_posted": "4/1/2018", "title": "Capital: The Edge Best Call Awards 2017", "article": " PICKINGS were better this year, with several stocks performing much better than expected \\u2014 surprising even the analysts, some of whom were rewarded for choosing to retain a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call against consensus.

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! \\u00a0 \nRHB Research Institute former analyst Ng Sem Guan and analyst Muhammad Syafiq Mohd Salam\\u2019s call on Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd By the time Press Metal was included as an FBM KLCI constituent on Dec 18, the largest integrated aluminium producer in Southeast Asia already had a market capitalisation of close to RM20 billion. It may be hard to imagine that the stock just crossed RM1 billion market capitalisation barely five years ago, in early 2013. By end-2016, its market capitalisation had risen to nearly RM6 billion, double what it was the year before. When RHB\\u2019s former analyst Ng Sem Guan started coverage in June 2013, the comparable (adjusted) share price was 39.7 sen. Four-and-a-half years on, the stock is up a whopping 1,154% to RM4.98 as at Dec 15. Total returns are six times higher, with Press Metal paying dividends every quarter for the past three years, up from twice a year before that, Bloomberg data shows. It also had a two-for-one stock split and 40% bonus issue in 2016. Ng was also acknowledged for his early \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on Press Metal last year. According to Bloomberg data, RHB\\u2019s Muhammad Syafiq Mohd Salam reiterated a \\u201cbuy\\u201d recommendation when assuming coverage on Aug 17 this year. In a note dated Nov 1, he told clients that Press Metal\\u2019s size (RM16 billion marketcap) meant that it could be included as an index constituent, about a month before the inclusion was announced. Press Metal, which ran 113% from the start of the year to RM3.32 on Aug 17, appreciated another 50% over four months to RM4.98 on Dec 15 \\u2014 bringing total gains for the year to 213%. At the time of writing, RHB still had a \\u201cbuy\\u201d recommendation and its RM5.30 target price \\u2014 the highest among four analysts tracking the stock \\u2014 implying only 6.4% upside potential. Risks to his forecast include a sharply weaker greenback, lower aluminium prices and unexpected production disruptions. A notable mention also goes to Kenanga Research\\u2019s Voon Yee Ping, who also rightly stuck with a \\u201cbuy\\u201d recommendation this year despite the strong price gains. Two other houses had \\u201cneutral\\u201d calls from April and August when the stock was below RM3.50, Bloomberg data show. It remains to be seen if Press Metal will provide reasons for further bullishness but the stock did reach RM5.47 intraday on Dec 4, although its highest close so far was RM5.184 on Nov 6. \\u00a0 Nomura Research\\u2019s Tushar Mohata\\u2019s call on Sunway Construction Group Bhd In a nutshell, this is a winning call because the stock price ran shortly after an upgrade to \\u201cbuy\\u201d from \\u201chold\\u201d. But there\\u2019s more depth than that. When Nomura Research\\u2019s Tushar Mohata upgraded Sunway Construction Group Bhd to \\u201cbuy\\u201d on March 9 this year, the share price rose 45% within nine months to as high as RM2.41 on Dec 11, before retracing to RM2.38 on Dec 15. Before the upgrade, the stock price had largely been hovering between RM1.50 and RM1.60 for about a year. His decision to upgrade Sunway Construction resulted from what he calls an \\u201cearnings-cash flow matrix\\u201d as well as \\u201cthe law of diminishing returns\\u201d at a time when most construction companies were already sitting on record-sized order books. A high base means small and medium-sized project awards could mean very little incremental impact on future earnings and share price. That came after he revisited Nomura\\u2019s investment thesis for the Malaysian construction sector. While net profit remains the best long-term predictor for stock price returns, he told clients that the cash conversion of reported earnings was becoming equally important due to rising gearing in a weak property market. The latter was the reason Tushar preferred pure-play Malaysian contractors like Sunway Construction to diversified contractors with exposure to property development. According to him, Sunway Construction\\u2019s earnings \\u201cfairly accurately track its actual cash flows, reflective of its healthy margins and timely collection from customers\\u201d. That\\u2019s a better position than companies which may have good reported earnings but subpar conversion of it to operating cash flow due to reasons such as non-cash earnings stream and growing working capital, which leads to higher gearing (thus burdening the balance sheet). A notable mention also goes to Macquarie Research\\u2019s Aiman Mohamad, who has had a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on Sunway Construction since at least March 2016, according to Bloomberg data. Both Nomura and Macquarie currently have the street\\u2019s most bullish target price of RM2.80. \\u00a0 Affin Hwang Capital Research\\u2019s Kevin Low\\u2019s call on Inari Amertron Bhd Inari Amertron saw its stock price more than double this year. Affin Hwang\\u2019s Kevin Low, started coverage as early as April 23, 2013, when the comparable stock price was 16 sen. He continues to like Inari, calling it a \\u201cpreferred pick\\u201d for the local technology sector due to its \\u201csolid growth in the RF segment given new drivers, including the Osram IRIS IR chip, and its data server chip business from Broadcom\\u201d. Key downside risks to his recommendation include a slowdown in global demand for smart devices, rapid average sale price (ASP) erosion, loss of customer base and the introduction of new technologies that may render Inari\\u2019s products obsolete. According to Bloomberg data, there is currently one \\u201cfully valued\\u201d call from DBS Vickers with a RM2.25 target price. Six analysts have \\u201chold\\u201d or \\u201cneutral\\u201d calls on Inari while the remaining six (including Low) recommend as \\u201cbuy\\u201d. Time will tell who will prove prescient this time next year. This year, a notable mention also goes to Macquarie Research\\u2019s Anand Pathmakanthan, as clients would have benefited from his upgrade from \\u201cneutral\\u201d to \\u201coutperform\\u201d in January when the stock price was RM1.60. Similarly, RHB Research\\u2019s Kong Heng Siong upgraded his call to \\u201cbuy\\u201d when the stock price was RM1.90 on March 22. Credit Suisse\\u2019s Danny Chan, who started coverage with an \\u201coutperform\\u201d call on July 11 when the stock was at RM2.13 apiece, also deserves a notable mention. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 Affin Hwang Capital Research\\u2019s Kevin Low\\u2019s call on KESM Industries Bhd When starting coverage on KESM Industries on Aug 15, 2016, Affin Hwang\\u2019s Kevin Low told clients the company was a good proxy for the stable and growing automotive semiconductor segment, going by growing demand for electronics for vehicles from safety to infotainment and autonomous vehicles. In just four months, the stock has gained 34% \\u2014 making him a winner last year. He continues his winning ways this year: at RM19.50 on Dec 15, KESM shares had doubled from the start of the year \\u2014 and there\\u2019s still upside if Low\\u2019s RM21.80 target price is to be believed. In fact, KESM reached as high as RM20.50 intraday on Nov 23 before closing at RM20.40. \\u201cWe favour KESM for its exposure to the automotive space, an area we believe will continue to benefit from structural growth underpinned by increased semiconductor content in automobiles as well as growth in demand for hybrid and autonomous vehicles,\\u201d Low wrote in a Dec 18 note, reiterating his \\u201cbuy\\u201d call. In an earlier note dated Nov 24, he told clients that KESM\\u2019s revenue and earnings momentum \\u201cremained strong\\u201d, underpinned by aggressive capital expenditure into the automotive burn and test business. He also noted that 1QFY7/2018 net profit would have been stronger if not for higher effective tax rate of 15.5% versus 10.4% in 1QFY7/2017. Key downside risks include a loss of customers and a reduction in the outsourcing opportunities as customers increase their in-house burn-in and test function, he says. Two other analysts have since started coverage on KESM this year, according to Bloomberg data. CIMB Research has an \\u201cadd\\u201d rating and RM22 target price while Kenanga Research is going against consensus with an \\u201cunderperform\\u201d call and RM18.40 target price, which is below open market prices. It would be interesting to see if Low will make it a hat trick next year. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 KAF Seagroatt & Campbell Securities\\u2019 Mak Hoy Ken\\u2019s call on Econpile Holdings Bhd Econpile Holdings shares have gained as much as 77.6% this year, closing at RM3.195 on Dec 4. Even measured from this year\\u2019s cut-off date of Dec 15, gains came to an enviable 73%. In a Dec 29 note last year, KAF\\u2019s Mak Hoy Ken retained his \\u201cbuy\\u201d call. He sees Econpile as the research house\\u2019s \\u201ctop small-cap construction pick for its burgeoning order book, sustained job momentum and attractive margins\\u201d. The civil engineering contractor\\u2019s market capitalisation breached RM1 billion in late October 2016. Back then, he also told clients that more strategic opportunities could stem from Econpile\\u2019s 60:40 tie-up with China Communications Construction Co (M) Sdn Bhd (CCCC) for a substructure and ancillary works package for SUKE highway, as it was a strong endorsement of Econpile\\u2019s position as a piling specialist in Malaysia. At the time of writing, Mak\\u2019s target price of RM3.33 implies only 7% upside potential from RM3.11 on Dec 15. It remains to be seen just how much comfort should be drawn from his Oct 20 note, where he said Econpile\\u2019s earnings visibility \\u201cremains solid, backed by a healthy outstanding order book of RM1.2 billion or around 2.1 times its construction revenue\\u201d. Meanwhile, Macquarie Research\\u2019s Aiman Mohamad, who started coverage with an \\u201coutperform\\u201d call on Feb 23 this year when the stock price was at RM2.07 apiece, also deserves a notable mention, with Econpile shares up 50.2% to RM3.11 apiece in about 10 months. Macquarie has a RM3.50 target price. \\u00a0 \nKAF Seagroatt & Campbell Securities\\u2019 Mak Hoy Ken\\u2019s call on Ann Joo Resources Bhd With shares of Ann Joo Resources Bhd up 83% to RM3.80 as at Dec 15 this year, investors who bought the stock at the start of the year would be sitting on good portfolio gains. KAF\\u2019s Mak Hoy Ken maintained a \\u201cbuy\\u201d on the stock with a higher target price of RM2.42 (from RM2.38) on Jan 5. The stock dipped to RM2.17 \\u2014 its lowest this year \\u2014 on Jan 3. At its peak, it closed as high as RM3.91 on Nov 9. Back then, Ann Joo\\u2019s share price had just gained 224% in 2016 and there were doubts in the market on whether the stock would continue to perform, especially with the direction of international steel prices being mixed at best. Mak was held to his belief that there was more upside to Ann Joo. Among other things, he argued that domestic steel prices would see support from provisional safeguard duties on imported bars and wire rods. With the counter trading at only eight to 10 times forward earnings multiples, he was convinced it was a cheaper alternative play to the Malaysian infrastructure supercycle. There is also a potential lift from a continued recovery in Chinese steel prices as capacity cuts in that country gathers pace. Chinese steel prices have been on a general upward trend this year as the country\\u2019s supply-side reforms took effect. A notable mention goes to Maybank Investment Bank Research\\u2019s Lee Yen Ling, who upgraded her call for Ann Joo on Aug 16, 2016, when the stock price was at RM1.72. At the time of writing, Maybank\\u2019s Lee has since downgraded her call to \\u201chold\\u201d with a RM3.85 target price while KAF\\u2019s Mak continues to call a \\u201cbuy\\u201d with a RM4.10 target price. Watch this space. \\u00a0 \nKenanga Research\\u2019s Desmond Chong\\u2019s call on Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd It was almost as if he had a crystal ball. When Kenanga Research\\u2019s Desmond Chong upgraded his call on Malaysian Pacific Industries (MPI) from \\u201cmarket perform\\u201d to \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Jan 27, the stock price ran up 79% from RM7.97 to RM14.291 on Oct 11. Helping the gains were the better sales that MPI was seeing of its automotive electronics and power management chips as well as improved efficiency. He subsequently raised his target price three more times to as high as RM15.70 on Aug 18. That\\u2019s not all. When Chong turned cautious on its outlook and downgraded MPI to \\u201cmarket perform\\u201d or a neutral stance on Nov 10, the stock price retraced 12% fromRM13.64 to RM12 on Dec 15. In a Nov 10 note issued following a briefing, he highlighted the \\u201cmounting pressure on margins\\u201d coupled with a potential setback from a longer gestation period for its product rationalisation exercise. A special mention also goes to KAF Seagroatt & Campbell Securities\\u2019 Shafiq Kadir and TA Securities\\u2019s Paul Yap, who earlier had \\u201cbuy\\u201d calls that also proved right. Kenanga\\u2019s call got more points as MPI shares ran shortly after his upgrade compared with the two existing \\u201cbuy\\u201d calls. All three currently have \\u201chold\\u201d calls on MPI, in line with consensus. At the time of writing, Affin Hwang Capital Research had the only \\u201csell\\u201d on the stock, with a target price of RM12, according to Bloomberg data. Will he have the last laugh next year? \\u00a0 \nUOB Kay Hian Research\\u2019s Ridhwan Effendy\\u2019s call on Kerjaya Prospek Group Bhd Investors who made money might recall that UOB Kay Hian\\u2019s retail research team started coverage on Kerjaya Prospek as far back as January 2016 when it was still called Fututech Bhd. The team called the stock \\u201can upcoming mid-cap construction company\\u201d that would emerge as an end-to-end building contractor with RM2.7 billion order book after completing the acquisition of two privately-run construction companies. At the time, the (adjusted) stock price was RM1.69. As at Dec 15, it had gained 134% to RM3.97, although that is off as high as RM4.08 on Nov 3. This year, alone, Kerjaya shares were up 83% at the time of writing. On Jan 3, UOB\\u2019s Ridhwan Effendy told clients that 2017 would continue to be an eventful year for Kerjaya \\u2014 which stands out as a potential capital management play \\u2014 given its strong cash pile of RM107 million or 10% of its market capitalisation back then. According to Bloomberg data at the time of writing, UOB is the only house still calling a \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Kerjaya, while the remaining two houses with active coverage have \\u201cneutral\\u201d or \\u201cunderperform\\u201d. The \\u201cunderperform\\u201d call, made in early August when the share price was RM3.54, but the stock is at RM3.97 currently. UOB upgraded the stock to \\u201cbuy\\u201d again on Nov 23 with a higher target price of RM4.53 (from RM3.81) after raising its earnings estimates as well as order book win assumptions. Ridhwan continues to like Kerjaya for its superior margins, high order book cover, net cash of RM163 million (28.9 sen per share) and ability to clinch new contracts. \\u00a0 \nUOB Kay Hian Research\\u2019s Ridhwan Effendy\\u2019s call on Sunsuria Bhd UOB Kay Hian was the first house to initiate coverage on Sunsuria nearly three years ago. At the time, the headline recommendation was \\u201chold\\u201d, based on a 50% discount to its sum-of-parts valuation.\\u00a0 Nonetheless, the research house told clients that it expected the company to take on a major asset acquisition strategy: \\u201cInvestors with the risk appetite for small-caps should consider re-entering ahead of the announcement which is expected to be in 1Q2015,\\u201d it said in a brief note dated Feb 18, 2015. That gives this submission an edge over others. Based on where the stock is today post the corporate developments, the equivalent (adjusted) stock price would be 86.8 sen. A simplistic measurement would show a 78.6% gain at its recent peak of RM1.55 on July 14, 2017. UOB Kay Hian\\u2019s Ridhwan Effendy raised his target price to RM1.25 (from RM1) when reiterating a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on Jan 12 this year as he expected Sunsuria to enter a multi-year growth phase. Riding on the success of Xiamen University, Ridhwan expects its flagship Sunsuria City development to be a key driver for sales and earnings. Sunsuria\\u2019s stock price took only about a month to reach the new target price and on Feb28, Ridhwan raised the target price to RM1.50 \\u2014 which the stock hit on April 10 before retracing to RM1.40-levels. On May 25, Ridhwan downgraded the stock to \\u201chold\\u201d with an unchanged target price after the release of the company\\u2019s 2QFY2017 earnings, telling investors to \\u201ccapitalise on their gains\\u201d as he believed its near-term potential had been reflected after a 42% year-to-date climb.\\u00a0 At the time, the stock price was RM1.41 and the highest it went was a 9.9% rise to a recent high of RM1.55 on July 17 before retracing to RM1.34, about 5% lower than at the point of downgrade. \\u00a0 \nAmInvestment Bank Research\\u2019s Alex Goh\\u2019s call on Petronas Gas Bhd AmInvestment Bank\\u2019s Alex Goh got it right when he cut Petronas Gas to \\u201csell\\u201d from \\u201chold\\u201d on Nov 18 with a RM16.65 target price while the stock was trading at RM20-levels. From there, the price skidded 22% to as low as RM15.88 on Nov 30. The magnitude of the fall is considerably sharp, given that Petronas Gas is a big-cap counter with a market capitalisation of RM33.6 billion. In fact, between Nov 18 last year and the recent low on Nov 30, it lost a whopping RM10.1 billion in market capitalisation. When downgrading his call more than a year ago, Goh told clients about the chances of impending earnings erosion given the Energy Commission\\u2019s upcoming plan to implement incentive-based regulation (IBR) tariffs on the group\\u2019s gas transport tariff. That made it hard to justify the company\\u2019s valuation and share price of above RM20. On Dec 5, Goh seemed to have also rightly upgraded Petronas Gas to a \\u201chold\\u201d with a RM16.65 target price when the share price was at RM16.10. Closing at RM16.96 on Dec 21, the stock had gained 5.3%. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that TA Securities\\u2019 analyst Kylie Chan also had a \\u201csell\\u201d call on the stock, according to Bloomberg data, when many others on the street still said \\u201chold\\u201d. \\u00a0 \nInter-Pacific Securities Research\\u2019s Wong Ling Ling\\u2019s call on Uchi Technologies Bhd 2017 has been a spectacular year for Uchi Technology, as was Inter-Pacific Securities Research\\u2019s Wong Ling Ling\\u2019s \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the company. The company\\u2019s share price had gained between 13% and 30% a year between 2012 and 2016 and this year was beginning to look that way as well until a sharp rally occurred from the middle of the year, barely a fortnight from the time she started coverage on the stock with a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call. Uchi\\u2019s performance likely surprised even her. Only three analysts are actively tracking Uchi, according to Bloomberg data. When Wong started coverage on June 15, Uchi shares were at RM1.84 a share. From there, it rocketed 93% in just over five months to RM3.55 on Nov 29. At RM3.45 on Dec 15, Uchi\\u2019s market capitalisation stood at RM1.57 billion compared with about RM800 million just six months earlier. Wong\\u2019s \\u201cbuy\\u201d recommendation was premised on the company\\u2019s stable earnings growth, unique business model, a minimum dividend payout ratio of 70% of profit after tax, very comfortable profit margins and a clientele comprised of industry market leaders. It would be interesting to see if Uchi, which specialises in the design of electronic control systems for a number of multinational companies that are global leaders in their respective industries, can continue to surprise on the upside next year. \\u00a0 \nHong Leong Investment Bank Research\\u2019s Jeremy Goh\\u2019s call on George Kent (M) Bhd This time last year, HLIB Research\\u2019s Jeremy Goh was the only analyst actively tracking George Kent, telling clients that the water meter-turned-engineering company had RM5.1 billion engineering order book and \\u201ccan no longer be ignored\\u201d. Today, he is one of three analysts calling a \\u201cbuy\\u201d on the company he described as one with 68 sen per share net cash and a \\u201ckey rail play with exposure to the LRT extensions\\u201d. His target price is currently RM3.90. Closing at RM3.62 on Dec 15, George Kent shares had gained 83% year to date, continuing its ascent from the year before. In a Dec 7 note after the company\\u2019s third quarter earnings briefing, Goh noted that George Kent \\u2014 which is the leader for water meters in Malaysia, with over a 50% market share \\u2014 could see the opening of \\u201ca whole new market\\u201d for itself when it commercialises its automated meter reading (AMR) product, which allows remote reading of water meters. Selangor is expected to call tenders for AMR meters in two months for a pilot project while Johor and Penang are also looking to replace traditional meters, Goh said. The company (via a joint venture with Siemens) is also preparing to put in a bid for the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail (HSR) asset company (AssetsCo) that will help develop key parts of the project. That may provide further catalysts for the stock next year. \\u00a0 \nUOB Kay Hian Research\\u2019s Kong Ho Meng\\u2019s call on Sapura Energy Bhd When analysts rushed to revise their \\u201cbuy\\u201d and \\u201cneutral\\u201d calls on Sapura Energy Bhd in early December, after a large quarterly net loss, UOB Kay Hian Research\\u2019s Kong Ho Meng stood out as he had had a \\u201csell\\u201d call for close to six months. The stock tumbled 20% in a single day on Dec 7, after the group announced a quarterly net loss of RM274.4 million for the third quarter ended Oct 31, a sharp contrast to a net profit of RM158 million the year before. Looking back, we see that the share price had in fact been drifting lower since mid-June when the consensus view was that the oil\\u00a0 and gas giant was in calmer waters as the recovery of global crude oil prices gathered steam. Kong\\u2019s timely downgrade of his call from \\u201cneutral\\u201d to \\u201csell\\u201d on June 20 would have saved clients from sizeable portfolio losses. From RM1.67, the stock price tumbled 53% to 78.5 sen at our award evaluation cut-off date of Dec 15. When The Edge went to print, the stock price had slid further to a record low of 71.5 sen on Dec 21. A notable mention goes to Credit Suisse\\u2019s Danny Chan, who also went against the grain with a contrarian \\u201csell\\u201d call since June, although he prematurely upped his recommendation to \\u201cneutral\\u201d while the counter was still heading south. \\u00a0 \nAffin Hwang Capital Research\\u2019s Ng Chi Hoong\\u2019s call on Jaks Resources Bhd Jaks Resources is not well tracked by analysts, many of whom may feel the need to observe the company from the sidelines for the time being since its power generation project in Vietnam will only start contributing in 2020 and be a good source of recurring income. The lack of coverage makes Affin Hwang Capital\\u2019s Ng Chi Hoong\\u2019s \\u201cbuy\\u201d recommendation and analysis stand out even more. Those familiar with the company would know Jaks is undertaking a US$1.87 billion 1,200MW coal-fired thermal power plant project near Hai Duong, together with China Power Engineering Consulting Group Co Ltd (CPECC). Jaks holds a 30% stake in the joint venture and CPECC the remaining 70%. In a Jan 4 note, Ng raised his target price for Jaks to RM2 (from RM1.60) following a review of its assets after the company said it was realigning its focus on Vietnam given the slowdown in the property market in Malaysia. At the time, Jaks\\u2019 share price was at RM1.01. It took barely three months to jump 70% to reach RM1.72 on April 5 before retracing. Following the strong rally, Ng downgraded his call to \\u201chold\\u201d on May 25 when the price was RM1.58. When it skidded to RM1.38 on Oct 17, however, he saw reason to upgrade to \\u201cbuy\\u201d again with RM1.75 target price. Jaks closed at RM1.50 as at Dec 20, up 48.5% from the time Ng reiterated his \\u201cbuy\\u201d call with a higher target price. A special mention goes to Affin\\u2019s Lim Yee Tang, who initiated coverage on Jaks before he moved to equity sales. Ng assumed coverage from November 2016. \\u00a0 \nKenanga Research\\u2019s Raymond Choo\\u2019s call on Hartalega Holdings Bhd At the start of 2017, Kenanga Investment Research\\u2019s Raymond Choo boldly recommended that clients buy Hartalega Holdings shares. He was the only one of 20 analysts tracking the stock to do so, according to Bloomberg data. In fact, there was as many as five \\u201csell\\u201d calls. The lack of enthusiasm may have stemmed from the fact that Hartalega shares were down 17% year on year in 2016 after gaining 72% y-o-y in 2015. A long-time favourite of investors, the leading nitrile glove maker sprang a surprise rebound this year, rising more than120%. The stock moved from RM4.76 as at end-2016 to RM9.75 on Dec 15, our award evaluation cut-off date. As at Dec 20, the stock price reached RM11.40! Investors who bought shares early this year would have Choo to thank. His contrarian stance stemmed from the conviction that Hartalega was capitalising on its new capacity from the NGC plant in Sepang on the back of robust demand and a slower-than-expected production ramp-up in the other rubber glove players. He was convinced by Hartalega\\u2019s constant desire to move up the value chain by offering superior product innovation and automating its production processes. Hartalega\\u2019s recently announced first non-leaching antimicrobial nitrile examination glove is also expected to be a game changer in the rubber glove industry. Inter-Pacific Securities\\u2019 David Lai Yoon Hui also deserves a notable mention for also having a \\u201cbuy\\u201d for the most part, save for a blip in May. \\u00a0 \nMIDF Research\\u2019s Ng Bei Shan\\u2019s call on Superlon Holdings Bhd At its peak, Superlon Holdings Bhd\\u2019s market capitalisation reached RM463.7 million when its share price rose to RM2.92 on Sept 18. While some institutional investors may consider this small, the market cap is already more than double the RM202.47 million the company was valued at on Nov 22 last year \\u2014 the day MIDF Research\\u2019s Ng Bei Shan initiated coverage on the maker of synthetic rubber insulators used mainly for heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC) and refrigeration \\u2014 which are important for high-rise buildings and industrial use. The recommendation was based on the prospects for its new warehouse, which would improve lead time and sales; market dominance; and its sturdy balance sheet (RM39.13 million net cash) that spelt dividend payments. In fact, MIDF had been watching Superlon for some months, starting with a non-rated report in March 2016, when its market cap stood at RM159.6 million. Measured from Nov 21, 2016, the share price appreciated as much as 137% to reach RM2.92 on Sept 11 this year. Part of the gains were thanks to a share split that the company had hoped would improve liquidity \\u2014 a move that was rewarded with the entry of institutional investors, including the emergence of Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) as a substantial shareholder with a 10.49% stake. Closing at RM2.15 on Dec 15, the counter had skidded 26% from its recent peak but it remains about 75% above the time MIDF started calling a \\u201cbuy\\u201d. Ng, who had downgraded the stock to \\u201cneutral\\u201d on Sept 27, when her target price was nearly met and its 1QFY2018 earnings were hit by a spike in raw material price, upgraded her call again to \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Dec 15 following the share price weakness. At the time of writing, its RM2.36 target price implies 9.8% upside potential from current levels.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \nAffin Hwang Capital Research\\u2019s Tan Jian Yuan\\u2019s call on Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd If you had bought Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd shares when Affin Hwang Research\\u2019s Tan Jian Yuan started coverage with a \\u201cbuy\\u201d and RM2.40 target price, you would have seen your holdings rise 67.7% over seven months from RM1.76 to RM3.22 on Dec 15. That\\u2019s if you did not get the initial public offering (IPO) shares for Serba Dinamik, which made a strong debut on the Main Market on Feb 8 this year and went on to become the year\\u2019s best-performing IPO with a gain of 119% as at Dec 15. Kenanga Investment Bank was the IPO lead manager. When Tan started tracking Serba Dinamik about two months from its debut, the stock price had already appreciated 10% from its IPO price. Yet he was convinced that there was at least 45% more upside potential \\u2014 and was proved right. At the time, Tan was upbeat on its growth potential, expecting strong maintenance activity growth and expansion of engineering, procurement, construction and contracting (EPCC) revenue to drive forward earnings. He also expected the group to pay out 25% to 30% of net profits in FY2017 to FY2019, translating into decent yields of3.3% to 5.2%, the initiation report read. A notable mention goes to RHB Research Institute\\u2019s Wan Mohd Zahidi, who initiated coverage on May 8 with a RM2.78 target price when the stock price was at RM1.92, as well as Alliance DBS Research\\u2019s Inani Rozidin, who initiated coverage on May 16 this year with a RM2.90 target price when the stock was at RM2. Investors would also have made good money following their recommendations, despite the later initiation dates. At the time of writing, Tan\\u2019s RM4 target price shows that he remains among the most bullish of all seven analysts calling a \\u201cbuy\\u201d while RHB\\u2019s is the lowest at RM3.10 \\u00a0"}, "114": {"date_posted": "2/1/2018", "title": "T7 Global lands multiple contracts worth RM260m", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 2): T7 Global Bhd via its subsidiaries Tanjung Offshore Services Sdn Bhd and Wenmax Sdn Bhd has received multiple contracts worth a total of RM260 million. In a filing with the stock exchange today, T7 Global said Tanjung Offshore has received a service order from Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Sdn Bhd, to carry out insulation work for the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) Package 14 project. This contract is from November 2017, until the expected completion date at the end of May 2018. Additionally, Tanjung Offshore was awarded a contract by Repsol Oil & Gas Malaysia Ltd, for the provision of blasting and painting services for a primary period of two years, tentatively from November 2017 until October 2019. The contract has an extension option of one year. Repsol also awarded two contracts to Wenmax, one being a 4+4 year contract for the supply of carbon dioxide gas separation membrane elements and consumables, while the other is a one-off supply contract for the provision of MRU absorbent materials for gas MRU field trial. Wenmax\\u2019s other contract was from Petronas Technical Services Sdn Bhd for the engineering, procurement, fabrication, and commissioning of Crude Transfer Metering System (CTMS) package for Pengerang Deepwater Terminal 2, from Aug 2017 until May 2018. It also received a purchase order from Sabah Shall Petroleum Co Ltd for a 5+1 year price agreement contract, for the supply of Single Buoy Mooring (SBM) Hoses until 2019. In the bourse filing, the oil and gas service provider involved in both upstream and downstream processes said the contracts are expected to contribute positively towards earnings and net assets per share of the company from its financial year ending Dec 31, 2018 (FY18) onwards.\\u00a0 In statements accompanying the announcement, T7 Global chairman Datuk Seri Dr Nik Norzul Thani bin N. Hassan Thani said these contracts represented a testament to the strong partnerships the company has with the parties.\\u00a0 \"We are making good progress in replenishing our work orders. We are reasonably optimistic of building up our order book and are actively bidding for projects,\\u201d he said. At noon break today, shares in T7 Global were unchanged at 41 sen, after some 295,000 shares were exchanged, giving it a market capitalisation of RM171.98 million."}, "115": {"date_posted": "2/1/2018", "title": "Top 10 Stock Picks for 2018", "article": " The Edge Financial Daily\\u2019s picks are based on some of the investment themes that fund managers are exploring in 2018. These themes include the turnaround of the badly hit oil and gas industry where many companies\\u2019 share prices have tumbled to all-time lows; better corporate earnings growth amid a synchronised global economy recovery; interest rate hikes globally; and a strengthening ringgit. Meanwhile, the e-commence boom that leads to stronger demand for logistics services and improved consumer sentiments that will boost private consumption could also be the buying impetus that drives investors\\u2019 interests. We did not make a selection based on the 14th general election theme as most research houses have said the market could return to fundamentals after the election. \\u00a0 1. UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd - Bouncing back UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd (UMW O&G) could turn around in 2018 as its earnings recovery is on sight. The country\\u2019s biggest jack-up rig operator has returned to the black in the third financial quarter ended Sept 30, 2017 (3QFY17), with a net profit of RM3.4 million, or 0.16 sen per share, compared to a net loss of RM135.4 million, or 6.26 sen per share. UMW O&G has seen its fleet utilisation improve from a dismal average of 21% in the 1QFY16 to 68% and 90% in 2QFY17 and 3QFY17 respectively. According to TA Securities analyst Abel Goon, UMW O&G\\u2019s management expects the utilisation rate to be greater than 90% in 4QFY17, while FY18 will realise at least 80% utilisation rate. \\u201cFor UMW O&G, one of the key risks is the idling costs incurred. With the utilisation rate now back to about 90% level, the company should see a turnaround in 2018. Although the rates remain at a fairly low level, the company would turn profitable if the management could maintain the utilisation rate,\\u201d Goon told The Edge Financial Daily over a phone call. He added that UMW O&G should be able to secure more drilling contracts from Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u2019s (Petronas) prioritising local content. Based on UMW O&G management\\u2019s feedback, Goon pointed that Petronas requires at least 12 rigs in Malaysia for FY18. UMW O&G currently has seven premium jack-up rigs generating 99% of the group\\u2019s revenue. Further, it is on a stronger financial footing after the completion of RM1.8 billion rights issue. UMW O&G has guided that a one-time write-off of unamortised transaction costs plus potential asset impairment loss arising from a year-end review in 4QFY17 could weigh on its annual earnings for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY17). Goon reckons the market has priced in a large impairment in 4QFY17, which is why the share price remains at a subdued level. At the current price, UMW O&G is trading at about 0.5 times its book value, one standard deviation below its historical average, despite the expected turnaround in its operations, alleviations of short-term liquidity risks and upwards trajectory seen in oil prices. TA Securities has set a target price of 51 sen a share, indicating a potential upside of 67.2% from its closing price of 30.1 sen last Friday. Nonetheless, there remains downside risks for O&G players, especially if the crude oil price sees another sharp decline, which could lead to low utilisation rate. The higher-than-expected finance costs, despite the reduction in borrowings, could also hurt UMW O&G, which has a relatively high gearing level. \\u2014 By Billy Toh \\u00a0 2. Inari Amertron Bhd - Riding on continuous firm demand Inari Amertron Bhd, one of The Edge Financial Daily\\u2019s stock picks for 2017, is also one of the top performers for the year on Bursa Malaysia. It remains as one of our stock picks amid expectations that demand for radio frequency (RF) filters to stay strong despite saturating growth in the global smartphone market. Affin Hwang analyst Kevin Low told The Edge Financial Daily that demand is driven by the increase in bandwidths and complexity in expanding the long-term evolution coverage, and that demand for RF will likely remain robust. Also, Inari\\u2019s customer, Broadcom, is a major player in this space. \\u201cThe number of Inari\\u2019s RF testers grew to 960 units and was projected to reach 1,000 units by end-2017. This had far exceeded our assumptions for FY18 (ending June 30, 2018) to FY20, as we had only expected the 1,000-unit mark to be hit by FY20,\\u201d Low said, adding that the Iris IR chip could be Inari\\u2019s new earnings driver. Inari achieved a net profit growth of 42.4% in the first financial quarter ended Sept 30, 2017 (1QFY17) to RM68.4 million, from RM48 million in the previous corresponding quarter, mainly due to increased demand for its existing and new products which came on stream during the past two quarters. The positive outlook is also supported by the upward forecast revision on global semiconductor sales by World Semiconductor Trade Statistics, which raised its forecast to an annual growth of 20.6% in 2017 and 7% in 2018. Similarly, other market researchers such as Gartner Inc and IC Insights have revised their forecasts upwards on the semiconductor industry due to exceptional growth in the memory device market. Inari\\u2019s share price, which closed at RM3.40 last Friday, has exceeded the average 12-month target price of RM3.09 by analysts based on data compiled by Bloomberg. Despite the optimism on demand, the slowdown in global demand for smart devices, loss of customer base, and the introduction of new technologies may render Inari\\u2019s products obsolete and could dampen its earnings prospects. Investors should also pay heed to a recent report on the forecasts cut on Apple\\u2019s iPhone X shipment by analysts citing tepid demand. In the last five years, Inari\\u2019s investors would have seen an annualise gain of 101.3%. At the current level, the stock is trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio (P/E) of 27 times compared with Apple Inc\\u2019s 18 times. Despite the downside risks, Inari has a proven track record with a good management and is a leading RF test house in Asia, which fit into our selections. \\u2014 By Billy Toh \\u00a0 3. Berjaya Food Bhd - Extra shots from Starbucks Berjaya Food Bhd (BFood) is expected to see its earnings growth moving forward supported by Starbucks due to its store expansion and recovery in same-store sales growth (SSSG). The company will also benefit from a strong ringgit, which will help to expand its profit margin, as up to 50% of its materials are imported. According to the group\\u2019s latest financial results, BFood\\u2019s net profit grew 15.5% to RM5.8 million in the second financial quarter ended Oct 30, 2017 (2QFY18) from RM5 million a year ago, thanks to higher profit recorded by Starbucks\\u2019 operations in Malaysia and lower losses incurred by Kenny Rogers Roaster\\u2019s (KRR) operations in Indonesia arising from further closure of non-performing outlets. RHB Research analyst Soong Wei Siang told The Edge Financial Daily that BFood\\u2019s management is looking to turn around KRR Malaysia in FY18 and had implemented changes such as introducing a new menu and moderating the prices of dishes served. He said BFood\\u2019s management also aims to improve service standards at KRR Malaysia to the level of Starbucks. In previous quarters, BFood\\u2019s earnings were dragged down by KRR\\u2019s operations. With a potential turnaround at KRR Malaysia and the Starbucks-driven growth, Soong said this provides a two-pronged avenue to spur earnings growth. \\u201cThe recent disposal of KRR Indonesia is earnings-accretive, and we believe it would continue to lift sentiments on the stock,\\u201d he said. Nonetheless, BFood is currently trading at a lofty valuation. At its closing price of RM1.85 last Friday, BFood is trading at a trailing P/E of 55 times. In comparison, Starbucks Corp, listed in the US, is only trading at a trailing P/E of 26 times. The downside risks at the current price include a lower-than-expected SSSG growth and rising operating costs. \\u2014 By Billy Toh \\u00a0 4. Straits Inter Logistics Bhd - Bunkering services fuel growth The company seems to have gained a new lease of life. Its net profit jumped 63 times to RM631,000 in the latest third financial quarter ended Sept 30, 2017 (3QFY17) from RM10,000 in 3QFY16, while its revenue grew 63.4% to RM33 million from RM20.2 million during the same period. It has secured a RM45 million bunkering services contract which will provide more stable revenue and wider margins compared with its oil trading operation. According to Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd head of research Kenny Yee, Straits Inter Logistics is the only listed bunkering company on Bursa. Bunkering is basically a \\u201cfloating petrol station\\u201d for sea dwelling vessels. \\u201cI think that while 3QFY17 shows a marked improvement, Straits Inter Logistics\\u2019 future earnings and prospect are bright. Currently, the trading and supply of oil products has been the main revenue contributor and the company is expected to move up the value chain with the acquisition of two bunkering vessels with a combined capacity of one million litres of premium oil,\\u201d Yee said. The two bunkering vessels are docked at Pasir Gudang, Johor and Labuan, according to Yee, and he pointed out the bunkering operations from the Pasir Gudang port had only commenced in 4QFY17, indicating better results in the quarter. In August last year, Straits Inter Logistics, formerly known as Raya International Bhd, unveiled a new corporate brand identity to reflect its new business direction, as a major marine logistics company providing premium oil bunkering services to marine and cargo bulk transporters, O&G vessels, floating production storage and offloading vessels, cruise ships and ferries. Under new managing director Datuk Seri Ho Kam Choy, who replaced Datuk Tan Seng Hu, and with a healthy balance sheet with net cash of RM16.5 million arising from a completed rights issue exercise, Straits Inter Logistics is in a good position to expand its bunkering business. With its share price leaping 94% in 2017, Straits Inter Logistics is trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio of 34.3 times; however, as earnings visibility improves with the start of its Pasir Gudang bunkering operations, the company\\u2019s earnings are expected to catch up with the valuation. Yee has a target price of 31 sen a share for Straits Inter Logistics, indicating a potential upside of 19.2%. \\u2014 By Billy Toh \\u00a0 5. Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd - Record high order book Less than a year after its listing on Bursa, Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd shares more than doubled to end 2017 at RM3.24, versus its initial public offering price of RM1.50. It has a market capitalisation of RM4.33 billion. Despite the volatility in crude oil prices leaving most of Malaysia\\u2019s O&G players beleaguered, the company has seen earnings rise year-on-year. Its net profit jumped nearly four times to RM229.5 million in the first nine months of 2017 due to improved contributions from its operations and maintenance as well as engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning services. Serba Dinamik, providing engineering solutions to O&G and power generation industries, is expected to benefit from a sector-wide recovery as oil prices stabilise, said PublicInvest Research deputy head of research Ching Weng Jin. Affin Hwang Capital Research has raised its target price for the stock to RM4 from RM3.60, touting Serba Dinamik\\u2019s RM4 billion order book target for the latest financial year ending Dec 31, 2018 (FY18) as conservative as the company is expected to expand its asset ownership. \\u201cAn all-time high order book of RM5.3 billion should drive better earnings growth in the financial year ending Dec 31, 2018,\\u201d said the research house in a Dec 13 note. It is screaming \\u201cbuy\\u201d on the stock among analysts who track it, with consensus 12-month target price of RM3.61, according to Bloomberg data. \\u2014 By Samantha Ho \\u00a0 6. CIMB Group Holdings Bhd - In calmer waters An interest rate hike and improved loan growth amid stronger economic growth augur well for the banking sector in 2018. CIMB Group Holdings Bhd may benefit from healthier capital market activities going forward, according to TA Securities. Analysts opine that better growth prospects across its Indonesian and Thai operations are also likely to support earnings. \\u201cWhile we forecast the overall credit charge to remain elevated, we believe the worst, in terms of asset quality, may be over,\\u201d TA Securities analyst Li Hsia Wong wrote in the research firm\\u2019s annual strategy report. Credit costs for CIMB improved to 73 basis points in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2017 from 78 basis points a year ago, despite a 9% quarter-on-quarter increase in absolute gross impaired loans. Also in its annual strategy report, TA Securities highlights CIMB is trading at an attractive price-book value of 1.12 times compared with an industry average of 1.15 times with its large market capitalisation at peers\\u2019 average of 1.5 times. Having rallied to a one-year high of RM7.08 at end-August last year, the share price retraced to RM6.54 last Friday. It has a market value of RM60.34 billion. The group commands 18 \\u201cbuy\\u201d calls, four \\u201cholds\\u201d and two \\u201csells\\u201d, according to Bloomberg data. Out of 24 analysts, 21 have a consensus 12-month target price of RM6.87 a share. \\u2014 By Samantha Ho \\u00a0 7. Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd - Contract wins to buoy Muhibbah New contract wins and positive prospects in the construction, O&G, marine and aviation sectors are expected to continue driving earnings at Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd, which provides engineering and construction services. The group recently secured a RM70 million contract to build a reinforced concrete jetty and platform from Tenaga Nasional Bhd, as well as a RM189 million work package for the mass rail transit 2. This brings its total order book to RM2.7 billion so far. According to MIDF Research head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman, Muhibbah is among the companies expected to benefit as an exporter of services and commodities. \\u201cThe group is expected to benefit from its exposure to Qatar and the tripling of its capacity there,\\u201d Mohd Redza told The Edge Financial Daily, noting the blockade on Qatar by other Gulf countries is unlikely to hamper the group. Additionally, the group is expected to gain from higher aviation activity, with recurring income from its associate, Cambodia Airports, he said. All seven analysts eyeing Muhibbah, and covered by Bloomberg, maintain a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the counter, with a 12-month target price of RM3.65 a share. It last traded at RM2.84, with a market capitalisation of RM1.37 billion. \\u2014 By Samantha Ho \\u00a0 8. Tenaga Nasional Bhd - Analysts screaming \\u201cbuy\\u201d Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) saw its share price soaring further last week following the government\\u2019s decision to fork out RM929 million to subsidise electricity tariff for the first six months of 2018 and also to keep the base tariff at 38.53 sen/kWh until 2020. Pending the release of regulatory period 2 (RP2) input details, most research houses have maintained their earnings forecasts and target prices for TNB. Maybank IB Research, in its latest research note dated Dec 27, said every 0.5 percentage point lower weighted average cost of capital from 2018 impacts the research house\\u2019s target by RM1.30, barring any unforeseen circumstances. \\u201cWe see room for Tenaga to rerate as doubts over the pass-through mechanism eventually dissipate,\\u201d said Maybank IB Research. \\u201cTenaga is seen as a liquid proxy to GDP (gross domestic product) growth,\\u201d MIDF Research\\u2019s Mohd Redza told The Edge Financial Daily on a phone call, adding the utility firm is likely to benefit from an expected economic expansion in 2018. He also pointed out the counter is among the stocks with a high trading velocity due to a strong following among local and foreign funds. Over the past one year, the stock grew about 14.41% to RM15.26 last Friday. According to Bloomberg, of the 25 analysts covering the company, 20 of them have a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the stock, four \\u201cholds\\u201d and one \\u201csell\\u201d. \\u2014 By Wong Ee Lin \\u00a0 9. Tasco Bhd - Clientele diversification the key driver Tasco Bhd has been strengthening its foothold in the logistics industry through diversifying its clientele and moving up the value chain by providing full-fledge logistics solutions to customers. Going into 2018, analysts are sanguine on its future growth following its venture into the cold chain market. It took over Gold Cold Transport Sdn Bhd, one of the largest cold chain logistics players in Malaysia, and MILS Cold Chain Sdn Bhd last year. MIDF Research analyst Adam Mohamed Rahim said the contribution from this segment, which started in the second quarter ended Sept 30, 2017 (2QFY18), is expected to increase moving forward. Adam added that Tasco\\u2019s regional distribution centre in the Digital Free Trade Zone for Renesas, one of the world\\u2019s largest producers of microcontrollers and microprocessors, is also one of the main drivers for Tasco\\u2019s \\u201cbright\\u201d outlook in 2018. Additionally, he noted that Tasco has entered into a shareholder agreement with Yee Lee Corp Bhd\\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary Yee Lee Trading Co Sdn Bhd, expected to provide expansion opportunities for Tasco, enabling the logistics player to access new markets and distribution networks. On whether it is now a good time for investors to buy the stock, Adam reckons so, explaining that Tasco is currently trading at a P/E of 14 times \\u2014 reasonable compared with most of its peers with a P/E of below 10 times and 20 times. Over the past year, the stock has rallied 41.5% to close at RM2.08 in 2017. Analysts\\u2019 target price is between RM2.55 and RM2.69, according to Bloomberg data. \\u2014 by Wong Ee Lin \\u00a0 10. MKH - Young trees to boost yield MKH Bhd, having made its foray into the oil palm plantation business 10 years ago, sees most of its oil palm trees reaching prime age in 2017 and 2018. With the expectation of better fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production to improve in the next few years, the plantation division is expected to sustain strong earnings growth and contribution to the group\\u2019s bottom line. MKH\\u2019s share price fell nearly 68% to RM1.63 in 2017 after its net profit for the financial year ended Sept 30, 2017 (FY17) declined 36.37% to RM130.48 million from RM205.04 million, mainly due to the absence on a net project grant worth RM11.7 million from the government and lower sales revenue. At the current level, MKH is trading at a trailing P/E of 5.8 times. In comparison, MKH trades at an average historical P/E of 9.5 times in the last five years. According to TA Securities analyst Steven Soo, MKH\\u2019s share price has bottomed to a reasonable price level. Hence, he opines that the stock should recover in the second half of 2018. With expectations of the CPO price at a sustainable level above RM2,300 and the attractive valuation that MKH offers, The Edge Financial Daily has selected MKH as one of the stock picks for 2018. MKH\\u2019s exposure to the property and construction segment could also see a turnaround with its launches in Kajang 2 if sales exceed expectations. MKH has deferred property launches on its prime land in Kajang and Semenyih over the past two years as it awaited the completion of key infrastructures such as the RM62 million flyover in Kajang 2, and the Sungai Buloh-Kajang mass rail transit line which has been operational since July 2017, according to AllianceDBS Research\\u2019s research report dated Nov 29. The research house noted the stronger-than-expected sales from launches in Kajang 2 could be a re-rating catalyst. Nevertheless, the key risks AllianceDBS pointed out is that MKH may face margin compression due to rising construction cost for property projects as well as exposure to fluctuations in crude palm oil prices which in turn could increase earnings volatility. \\u2014 by Wong Ee Lin"}, "116": {"date_posted": "2/1/2018", "title": "Factors that swing the market", "article": " As we usher in the New Year after the benchmark FBM KLCI closing in the positive zone in 2017\\u00a0 \\u2014 the first time in three years, many investors would ponder whether the strong momentum could continue into 2018. The following is the list of factors that could possibly swing the market moving forward: \\u00a0 Malaysia\\u2019s GE14 The much anticipated 14th general election (GE14) did not materialise in 2017, will definitely take place in 2018 before Aug 24 this year as the mandate of the ruling Barisan National (BN) coalition will end in June 2018. Analysts have in general expects the GE14 to be the main driver of investors\\u2019 sentiment in early 2018 before a return to fundamentals post GE14. So far, most research analysts view that the poll is likely to be in between February and April. The pre-election rally is expected to lift sentiments and improve the \\u201cfeel-good\\u201d factor, which is important for incumbent governments. The election-play counters, companies that are perceived to have a political favour or have the potential to benefit from a good performance at the ballot box by the incumbents such as Utusan Melayu (M) Bhd, George Kent (M) Bhd and Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd, to name a few, would draw some interest from traders and investors. Of course, just as with everything the upcoming GE14 could also pose a downside risk to the equity market as it might act as a short-term dampener on foreign investors who are wary of political risks. Risks to the equity market also include the outcome of the election, especially since most analysts have not priced in the possibility of an unprecedented victory for the opposition. The return of Malaysia\\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, to active politics, has definitely added a new variable into the equation. Should the unexpected happen, investors, both local and foreign alike, will most likely have to revisit the drawing board to evaluate the unchartered territory as BN has ruled since independence. This would lead to an immediate knee-jerk reaction to the stock market. \\u00a0 Price stability in crude oil The positive outlook and price stability in crude oil are viewed as a positive driver for Malaysia\\u2019s economy. The government has factored only a US$52 per barrel crude oil price in its Budget 2018\\u2019s revenue assumption. Every addition of US$1 per barrel will add up to RM300 million in government\\u2019s revenue and narrow the deficit by two basis points, according to TA Securities. This is positive from a sovereign credit rating perspective, which could also attract foreign investors into both the domestic equity and bond markets in Malaysia. The oil and gas companies that are listed on Bursa Malaysia will also benefit from a stronger and more stable oil price in 2018 after a disappointing performance in the last three years for most of the companies. With most of the impairments being done in previous years, some of these companies might return on investors\\u2019 radar as the oil price continues to make its climb. Nonetheless, in Petronas\\u2019 report on Activity Outlook 2018-2020, it highlighted three key factors that are critical for oil prices to gain strength. The first one is the compliance by Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and non-Opec countries on the output cut accord. The response from US tight oil players is also key to price recovery. It added that the ability to reduce breakeven cost from collaboration with service providers, especially deployment of innovative technology, has sustained the level of tight oil drilling activities in the US. On the demand side, Petronas highlighted that a sustained healthy global demand growth will facilitate oil stock drawdowns and subsequently hasten global oil market rebalancing. TA Securities also pointed out that Saudi Arabia\\u2019s resolve to maintain high crude oil prices may weaken post potential listing of Saudi Aramco in the second half of 2018. Furthermore, a possible fix to US shale players\\u2019 shortcomings in boosting supply, such as storage of hydraulic fracking crew and equipment, could limit the upside for oil prices. \\u00a0 Stronger ringgit The ringgit has make its comeback in 2017 and most research houses expect the trend of a firmer ringgit against the US dollar to continue this year. The local currency is viewed to have been oversold given the prolonged losses in 2014 to 2016. The ringgit is undervalued in view of the supportive fundamentals, a more stable oil price, external reserves rebuilding, sustained trade and current account surpluses, progress in fiscal consolidation, receding foreign holding risk in the bond market as well as resumption in the repatriation of export earnings. Affin Hwang Investment Bank Bhd said in its Malaysia Strategy 2018 Outlook report that typical beneficiaries from a stronger ringgit from an operational perspective includes airlines, auto and media companies on lower operating costs. As for the balance sheet, those with a higher proportion of US dollar-denominated borrowings are also likely to see improvement. The stronger ringgit would have a negative impact on exporters, such as rubber glove players and semiconductor companies but Affin Hwang noted that the negative currency impact on some of these players would be mitigated by the growth drivers in these sectors. \\u00a0 Monetary tightening and unwinding of QE The US has started the ball rolling with its rate hike and unwinding of its quantitative easing (QE). In October last year, the US Federal Reserve started to unwind its balance sheet, starting at US$10 billion every month and this will rise by US$10 billion each quarter onwards to a maximum of US$50 billion per month. The market is expecting another three rounds of rate hikes in 2018. The latest US tax cuts in 2018 that have just recently been passed will also lead to a stronger US dollar and greater inflation. Inflation could rise faster than expected when the higher disposable income from the US$1.4 trillion tax savings over the next decade filters through the economy. The faster-than-expected tightening in the developed markets could also induce volatility in financial markets due to rapid capital outflows from emerging markets such as Malaysia. In Malaysia, it is also likely that the central bank will follow suit as expectations of a hike in the overnight policy rate (OPR) has increased on the back of a strong gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first three quarters of 2017. The prospect of Bank Negara Malaysia raising the OPR will provide a near-term catalyst for the banking sector as banks benefit from an interest rate upcycle as loans are repriced quicker than deposits. Of course, the Malaysian banking sector could see some impact from the implementation of MFRS9 but research houses, such as Affin Hwang, do not foresee any material impact on earnings as asset quality remains healthy. \\u00a0 Corporate earnings expected to grow Corporate earnings among Bursa-listed companies had been disappointing considering the strong GDP growth in 2017. Moving forward, as global economy continues to show synchronised expansion, investors will need to see improvement in earnings to be convinced. According to Maybank Investment Bank (IB) Research\\u2019s report on 2018 Outlook & Lookouts, which was published in mid-December last year, global growth momentum is set to be maintained in 2018, expanding at 3.6%, the same pace as in 2017. Maybank IB Research expects a 5.3% growth in 2018, with domestic demand to continue as growth driver on the back of continued growth in consumer spending, public consumption and gross fixed capital formation on expansions in both private investment and public investment. Maybank IB Research has a core earnings growth estimate of 7.9% for 2017 and forecast of 9.7% for 2018 as compared to the \\u201cno growth\\u201d years between 2014 and 2016. Similarly, TA Securities expects earnings growth under its coverage to increase by 6.1% and 7.5% in 2018 and 2019 respectively. \\u00a0 External risks remain Being an open economy, Malaysia is highly exposed to external risks, such as trade protectionism and economic nasionalism, seen in the US under President Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly spoke of his intent to rectify persistent trade imbalances and trade barriers with other countries \\u2014 with China being on top of that list \\u2014 any trade war or implication of one among the two largest economies in the world will affect the world, including Malaysia. The uncertainty revolving Brexit as well as rising geopolitical tension between some of the countries could also impact investors\\u2019 sentiment. Among the main concerns involving geopolitical tensions are the ongoing feud between the US and North Korea, Arab Saudi and Iran. A potential war would put synchronised global economy expansion at a halt."}, "117": {"date_posted": "27/12/2017", "title": "FBM KLCI up 11.77pts at intraday high", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 27): The FBM KLCI rose 11.77 points or 0.7%, led by index-linked Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd and Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd share gains as both stocks tracked higher commodity prices.

A spokesperson for Dayang Enterprise Solutions Bhd sums it up when he says, \\u201cThe last three years were the most difficult and challenging times that we have ever experienced over the entire 37 years since our inception in 1980.\\u201d This could explain the cautious stand taken by the banks and financial institutions. Deleum Bhd CEO Nan Yusri Nan Rahimy acknowledges that the banks have been more cautious in their lending to the oil and gas sector in recent years. Meanwhile, Datuk Kamarul Redzuan Muhamad, CEO and managing director of Uzma Bhd, opines that it appears to be more difficult for oil and gas companies to get financing nowadays compared with when crude oil prices were above US$100 per barrel. \\u201cThis could be because there is no indication of where the industry is going,\\u201d he tells The Edge. Kamarul adds that the amount of work coming on stream now is considerably more than what was available two years ago, which might raise hopes of less harsh treatment by banks. Singapore banks are said to be less stringent with their clients than their Malaysian counterparts, which, it seems, is after some intervention by the Singapore government, although this cannot be proved. At home, some oil and gas sources say the Economic Planning Unit (EPU) in the Prime Minister\\u2019s Department, which is headed by Datuk Abdul Rahman Dahlan; the Malaysia Petroleum Resources Corporation (MPRC), the industry development agency under the Prime Minister\\u2019s Department; and Petronas are looking at assisting local players with their banking requirements. Unfortunately, messages and calls to Abdul Rahman went unanswered. While details are scarce, one source says the requisite data will be available with the MPRC 100, which is a ranking of the top publicly traded and privately held oil and gas services and equipment (OGSE) companies. MPRC 100 is released either at the end of the year or in March. \\u201cWith the release of the MPRC 100, the data on how well or badly the companies are doing will be available. From what we know, it\\u2019s pretty bad \\u2026 then, they (MPRC, EPU and Petronas) can act on it,\\u201d an industry player says. \\u00a0 Not the same fate for all But then, not all the companies seem to be facing difficulty in obtaining financing from the banks. Barakah Offshore Petroleum Bhd president and CEO Nik Hamdan Daud says, \\u201cOur bankers have been supportive in the last three years (when oil prices came tumbling down). Working capital lines have always been made available to our projects. We also get good support from our bankers on our vessel loans. (We have) deferred principal repayment for two years until 2019 amid the current low market demand for offshore vessels.\\u201d Barakah\\u2019s annual report reveals that the company\\u2019s principal bankers are Malayan Banking Bhd, Export-Import Bank of Malaysia Bhd, Affin Bank Bhd and AmBank (M) Bhd. The largest shareholders of Barakah are Nik Hamdan, with 38.9% equity interest, Sarawak-based Samling group with a 13.6% stake and Felda Investment Corp Sdn Bhd with an 8.91% stake. Similarly, a spokesperson for Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd says banks are still supportive and lending, albeit only when supported by contracts in hand. \\u201cWe must add that local banks have had better appetite than foreign banks in the last few years ... foreign banks are putting on the brakes, tightening the bolts and nuts and this invariably is not helping the industry during this crucial time. \\u201cFor an asset-intensive industry, certain categories of assets, like vessels, would have their valuations greatly reduced and breaches of loan covenants would become common and it is in these areas that it is only fair that bankers give their indulgence,\\u201d he says. Dayang\\u2019s largest shareholders are Sarawak-based Naim Holdings Bhd, with a 29.06% stake, the Ling family (25.25%) and Tengku Yusof Tengku Ahmad Shahruddin (7.52%). \\u201cBarakah and Dayang do not have the EPF or PNB as shareholders. Not exactly strong parentage to warrant such treatment from the banks,\\u201d a fund manager says. \\u00a0 Petronas Activity Outlook Even the Petronas Activity Outlook 2018-2020, which was released earlier in the month and made public for the first time, has many functions. Other than to keep the oil and gas players aware of the jobs being offered, it also highlights to the financial institutions the availability of jobs on the local front, helping to allay whatever fears they may have (see story on Page 72). Dialog\\u2019s Ngau, through an email, tells The Edge, \\u201cPetronas is a seasoned and professional integrated oil and gas company that has lived through the cyclical variations of the industry in the past. This report demonstrates that it has a sound grasp of the current and medium-term environment and a robust plan to progress successfully in this uncertain climate. \\u201cIts continued investment and careful management of upstream and downstream segments provide direction and opportunity for Malaysian companies and foreign investment.\\u201d When asked what he thought of the Activity Outlook, Ngau says, \\u201cIt has particularly highlighted the current investment at the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) and the opportunity for continued development of Pengerang into a regional downstream oil and gas hub, which will spur the growth of Malaysia\\u2019s oil and gas downstream sector, propelling the country into a new frontier of technology and economic development. \\u201cThe PIC is also expected to capitalise on the growing need for petrochemical products in Asia for the next 20 years.\\u201d Barakah\\u2019s Nik Hamdan says of the Activity Outlook, \\u201cIt is quite positive. Several significant contracts are under bidding now, which shows its commitment to roll out more projects.\\u201d Barakah recently signed a consortium agreement with Samling Energy Sdn Bhd and Brooke Dockyard and Engineering Works Corp to jointly bid for oil and gas-related projects in Sarawak. Samling Energy and Brooke Dockyard are Sarawak-based companies while Samling group has a 13.5% stake in Barakah. \\u201cFrom Deleum\\u2019s perspective, the Petronas Activity Outlook outlines the activities. It\\u2019s quite straightforward but these are proposed activity plans; we have to see them rolled out and implemented,\\u201d says Nan Yusri. \\u201cWhat is not clear are the factors that govern it. If the price of oil changes, Petronas will reassess the situation. We have to monitor the factors that govern the plan,\\u201d he says in a brief conversation with The Edge. \\u00a0 Deleum has been in the news lately In October, Deleum, via its 60% unit Deleum Primera Sdn Bhd, was awarded a maintenance, construction and modification contract for gas structures in Peninsular Malaysia by Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd. This could be worth anywhere between RM750 million and RM1 billion. Nevertheless, the margins for these jobs seem tight, largely because of competition. Petronas has some 3,900 companies registered as its contractors. Norway, which has a similarly sized oil and gas industry, has a mere 700 companies. This has resulted in a call for consolidation within the industry. Uzma\\u2019s Kamarul says, \\u201cIt means that people have to work better and people have to have better capabilities. Like it or not, what will happen is the natural attrition of those who are not capable. \\u201cPetronas is ensuring this happens by bringing the bigger contracts; people will say smaller companies are being sidelined, but you need this kind of thing \\u2026 this is the right time to do it.\\u201d Thus far, the only recent attempt at consolidation was a plan to merge Permodalan Nasional Bhd-controlled UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd with Ekuity Nasional Bhd\\u2019s Icon Offshore Bhd and Orkim Sdn Bhd, but the deal fell through. Other than the above, the only sizeable merger was when Dayang made a general offer for Perdana Petroleum Bhd in 2015 \\u2014 just after oil prices crashed. The Dayang spokesperson reminisces on the trials and tribulations after the huge RM1.16 billion takeover offer for Perdana. \\u201cWe quickly reverted to consolidation mode and essentially looked at ways of curtailing costs to sustain the onslaught of rate cuts and discounts. It is a survival of the fittest game as well as a time to demonstrate who can sustain longer and better. For us, we truly adhere to the fact that when the going gets tough, the tough get going. \\u201cIt is true grit and determination that has got us through this far, coupled with the fact that our clients and shareholders were understanding and supportive of our measures. We believe we may have seen the worst and the worst is over!\\u201d he says. \\u00a0 \\u00a0"}, "126": {"date_posted": "21/12/2017", "title": "Perdana Petroleum falls as much as 16.67% on expectation of losses in 2017", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 21): Shares of Perdana Petroleum continued its plunge on its fourth day of trading after a two-year long suspension, falling as much as 16.67% in active trade this morning. At 11.51am, Perdana Petroleum pared some of its losses and was down 13.89% or 5 sen to 31 sen with 30.98 million shares traded. On Tuesday, Perdana Petroleum hit its limit-down on the second day of trading, falling more than 45% to close at 36 sen. MIDF Amanah Investment Bank Bhd Research analyst Aaron Tan told theedgemarkets.com that the fall in the share price was because of market's expectation that the company is due to make massive losses for 2017, its third loss-making year in a row since 2015. However, he expects Perdana Petroleum could possibly stage a turnaround in 2018 due to the positive outlook on offshore activities next year as pointed out in the Petronas Activity Outlook 2018-2020. \"Perdana Petroleum's vessel utilisation rate is expected to hit more than 70% next year, owing to a maintenance, construction and modification (MCM) services contract won by Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd from Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd,\" he said, noting that Dayang owns a 60.48% stake in Perdana Petroleum. \"Perdana Petroleum is reliant on Dayang, and with Dayang's current orderbook worth about RM3.4 billion that could last them until 2022, I expect Perdana to post commendable earnings result in 2018; better than the loss made in the past three years,\" he added. \\u00a0"}, "127": {"date_posted": "15/12/2017", "title": "Uzma implements internal reorganisation", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 15): Not wanting to have all eggs in one basket, Uzma Bhd is undertaking an internal reorganisation exercise so that the group\\u2019s core activities are not housed under one single subsidiary. \\u00a0\nThe proposed reorganisation exercise also aims to streamline the group's structure and management.\\u00a0 In a filing with the stock exchange, Uzma noted many of Uzma's core projects are undertaken by Uzma Engineering Sdn Bhd (UESB), since most of the PETRONAS licenses are housed under this wholly-owned unit. \\u201cThe internal reorganisation was proposed to restructure the current set-up of the group\\u2019s core businesses and to streamline its structure and management.\\u00a0 \\u201cIn order to mitigate over concentrating of contracting risk in UESB, it is crucial to transfer some of UESB\\u2019s businesses to individual entity according to its nature of business,\\u201d the filing read.\\u00a0 As such, the reorganisation will involve the transfer of all cost centres, consultancy and resource solution businesses out of UESB.

KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia-based oil and gas (O&G) outfit De Raj Group AG just got the requisite approvals for a listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in Germany -- far from home but pushed to do so because banks are just not touching oil and gas companies, according to its CEO Vaidyanthan Nateshan. \\u201cWe have bankers telling us they won\\u2019t touch oil and gas companies with a barge pole, so I\\u2019m taking the company to Europe,\\u201d he was quoted as saying in\\u00a0The Edge Malaysia's cover story for the week of\\u00a0Dec 11-Dec 17, 'Oil & gas conundrum', by senior news editor Jose Barrock. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not the equity market that is tough, it\\u2019s the debt market.

Deleum Bhd CEO Nan Yusri Nan Rahimy acknowledged that banks have been more cautious in their lending to the O&G sector in recent years. Likewise, Uzma Bhd CEO and managing director Datuk Kamarul Redzuan Muhamad said O&G companies appear to have more difficulty securing financing nowadays than when oil prices were trading at above US$100 per barrel.\\u00a0 \\u201cThis could be because there is no indication of where the industry is going,\\u201d Kamarul told\\u00a0The Edge. But Kamarul highlighted that the amount of work coming on stream now is considerably more than what was available two years ago. Singapore banks, the weekly wrote, are said to be less stringent with their clients than their Malaysian counterparts, which seems to be the case after some intervention by the Singapore government, although this cannot be proved. As for Malaysia, the weekly wrote, citing O&G sources, that the Economic Planning Unit (EPU) in the Prime Minister\\u2019s Department, the Malaysia Petroleum Resources Corporation (MPRC) and Petronas are looking at assisting local players with their banking requirements. The EPU is headed by Datuk Abdul Rahman Dahlan, while the MPRC is an industry development agency under the Prime Minister's Department. Though details are scarce and Abdul Rahman could not be reached for comment, one source said the requisite data will be available with the MPRC 100, which is a ranking of the top publicly traded and privately held O&G services and equipment (OGSE) companies. MPRC 100 is released either at the end of the year or in March. \\u201cWith the release of the MPRC 100, the data on how well or badly the companies are doing will be available. From what we know, it\\u2019s pretty bad \\u2026 then, they (MPRC, EPU and Petronas) can act on it,\\u201d an industry player told the weekly. In the mean time, the Petronas Activity Outlook 2018-2020, which was released earlier in the month and made public for the first time, is helping to highlight to financial institutions the availability of jobs on the local front to allay whatever fears they have, besides keeping O&G players aware of the jobs being offered. Meanwhile, just over a year after the publication assessed the financial health of 33 listed oil and gas (O&G) companies last October, it conducted a review and found that their performance has not improved in general, according to a related story -- 'Not much improvement -- by writer Adam Aziz.

Revenue surged 42% y-o-y to RM242.62 million. Against this backdrop, the group\\u2019s share price closed at 97.5 sen last Friday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM265.2 million. But some may argue that the regional petrochemical distributor could be worth much more. \\u201cOur investments abroad are finally starting to mature ... Indonesia and Vietnam. This year, we are comfortably on target to generate RM900 million in turnover. Next year? We should be able to exceed RM1 billion in turnover,\\u201d says founder and executive chairman Ng Thin Poh. For the nine months ended Sept 30, the group booked RM14.7 million in net profit on revenue of RM676.18 million, up 28% and 40% y-o-y respectively. Assuming the group maintains its third-quarter performance, it should easily be able to hit Ng\\u2019s targets. \\u201cOur revenue has been driven by increased demand across the board. We are highly diversified and not reliant on any one product or client. Growth has been driven by new customers and increased demand from existing ones,\\u201d explains Ng. So, what does Samchem do? It may be easy to simplify Samchem\\u2019s business as a regional petrochemical distributor. In a nutshell, it procures, warehouses and distributes various petrochemical products. But a closer look reveals that the group has positioned itself as an integral part of the broader manufacturing supply chain. \\u201cOur principals are the top petrochemical companies in the world like Petronas Chemicals from Malaysia, Shell Chemicals from the Netherlands, ExxonMobil from the US and BASF from Germany,\\u201d says Ng. \\u201cAlong with other principals, we are able to supply over 500 different types of chemicals that are crucial for manufacturing. And across the region, we service over 6,000 customers.\\u201d From paints and automotive lubricants to mattresses, Samchem is able to source most raw inputs. In short, if a manufacturing process requires chemicals, Samchem can supply it. \\u201cThe only area we are currently not involved in is food processing and edible products,\\u201d says Ng. The range of products is not Samchem\\u2019s only strength. It would not be fair to peg it as a mere chemical trader \\u2014 a company that simply buys and sells. \\u201cIt is not easy to secure distributorship rights from our principals. They put us through stringent checks, like health and safety,\\u201d says Ng. On top of meeting the strict requirements, the group has also invested in physical infrastructure that gives its distribution network a sizeable reach in the region. It currently operates out of Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam and Cambodia. Looking ahead, Ng plans to expand into Myanmar and the Philippines, positioning the company as one of the major chemical distributors in Asean. \\u201cWhen we look at Malaysia alone, there is a limit to how much we can grow. To continue growing, we must expand abroad. We have strong support from our principals to expand abroad. They like working with us and want to work together to expand into these countries,\\u201d explains Ng. However, it has not been an easy journey. Samchem ventured into Vietnam in 2006 and into Indonesia in 2010. Expansion into both countries were fraught with challenges, says Ng. \\u201cWe made mistakes along the way, but we also learnt from them. Now, when we look to venture into the Philippines and Myanmar, we know how to plan accordingly,\\u201d he says. The cost of the ventures is reflected in the group\\u2019s lacklustre earnings in the last few years. The fall in crude oil prices in 2015 did not help either. But having weathered the difficult initial phase of the ventures abroad, Samchem is starting to reap the fruits. Today, Samchem is one of only three major petrochemical distributors in both Indonesia and Vietnam. For the third quarter, its Indonesian revenue rose 43% y-o-y to RM32.88 million, although profit before tax halved to RM540,000. Meanwhile, its Vietnamese operations saw revenue rise 65% y-o-y to RM75.38 million, driving profit up 25% to RM3.39 million. Samchem wholly owns the Indonesian operations and has a 63% stake in the Vietnamese business. A quick look at Samchem\\u2019s balance sheet reveals RM48.4 million in cash against RM164.3 million in debt, giving it a net gearing of 0.885 times. However, this may not truly reflect the group\\u2019s gearing. Over 98% of its debt is short term, used as working capital to facilitate inventory stocking. \\u201cAlmost all of our debt is for trade financing. We need to ensure that we have enough stock on hand to meet our clients\\u2019 needs. Some of these products take a month or two to be delivered, and our customers can\\u2019t wait so long,\\u201d explains Ng. In fact, he says, the group currently has no plans to make a cash call despite the expansion plans. \\u201cSome funds have approached us, but we are not considering a private placement at this time,\\u201d says Ng. \\u201cWe should be able to fund our capital expenditure plans with internally generated funds now that our Vietnamese and Indonesian operations are performing.\\u201d There is, however, one caveat. Ng is actively looking for merger and acquisition (M&A) opportunities. And if the right opportunity presents itself, the group may raise funds for it. \\u201cI believe the industry is ripe for consolidation. The smaller players are slowly losing competitiveness. And there will be opportunities for us to acquire the business; not the company, the business,\\u201d says Ng. On M&A, he says, \\u201cI have been approached to sell the company before. But I can tell you, I have absolutely no intention to sell. I want to continue growing this business that I have built over the past 28 years.\\u201d On a separate note, Samchem is expanding its footprint in Malaysia. It has acquired a piece of land in Westports and is building a new facility that will become its new headquarters. Including land cost of RM12 million, the facility is expected to cost RM30 million. The company can easily fund the expansion by disposing of its current headquarters in Shah Alam, Selangor, says Ng. He estimates that the capex for the Vietnam and Indonesia operations will be relatively small \\u2014 about US$500,000 (RM2.08 million) for Vietnam and US$500,000 to US$800,000 for Indonesia \\u2014 and unlikely to disrupt dividend payouts. \\u201cNow, we have operations in Jakarta, Surabaya and Medan. We plan to expand to Kalimantan ... Pontianak,\\u201d he adds. For investors eager to take a position in Samchem, however, there is one hurdle that even the fund managers are facing \\u2014 liquidity. The stock appears to be tightly held, making it difficult to acquire. The group\\u2019s average daily trading volume is around 733,000 shares. For fund managers at least, a private placement may be the most realistic way to pick up a meaningful position. \\u00a0"}, "135": {"date_posted": "29/11/2017", "title": "\\u2018Recovery in O&G industry hindered by low capex\\u2019", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd (UMW-OG), a stock that has fallen out of favour after the meltdown of crude prices in late 2014, beat estimates with its first-ever profitable quarter in two years in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2017. The performance brought fresh optimism about earnings recovery for other upstream players. But is the long wait finally over? Analysts are still sceptical, with no consistent work order flow in the local upstream segment with national oil firm Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) sticking to upstream capital expenditure (capex) cuts. \\u201cThe sector is at the crossroads. It looks like the recovery has started, but how strong and rapid will it be is what matters,\\u201d Inter-Pacific Securities Sdn Bhd head of research Pong Teng Siew told The Edge Financial Daily. \\u201cUntil there is a definitive rise in work order flow or upstream capital expenditure by Petronas, profitability of upstream players operating locally will remain subdued,\\u201d Pong said. While a rise in capex is uncertain, UMW-OG did see the utilisation rate of its seven rigs increase to around 90% in the quarter under review. But that was hampered by low charter rates, which barely broke even for some of its rigs, said AmInvestment Bank analyst Alex Goh. Despite the stabilising of oil price to date, the sum of contract awards by value to Malaysian oil and gas (O&G) players lagged in the first three quarters of 2017 \\u2014 it is even lower compared with the first three quarters of 2016, when oil price slumped below US$40 per barrel, meaning the worst in the sector is not over yet. \\u201cThe utilisation rate cannot go much higher, and there are contracts expiring in this quarter,\\u201d said Goh. \\u201cThe risk is still high \\u2014 it can easily go back into losses if no new contract is secured. The company has also warned of possible impairments in this quarter. \\u201cIts performance does not necessarily reflect other players as they are at different stages of the value chain. But work visibility for upstream players in Malaysia is just not present at the moment,\\u201d Goh added. UOB Kay Hian analyst Kong Ho Meng shared a similar view. \\u201cWhich is why I prefer companies that are internationally competitive players like Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd,\\u201d said Kong. But that, too, is not always the case \\u2014 Kong also cited Sapura Energy Bhd, which is a reputable international upstream contractor. For its six-month period ended July 31, 2017 (1HFY18), the diversified O&G group\\u2019s net profit contracted 74.6% to RM56.46 million, from RM222.58 million, while revenue declined 5.28% to RM3.43 billion from RM3.62 billion in 1HFY17. \\u201cIn this case, its earnings are still in a downgrade cycle due to declining rig utilisation and a significant gap in order book replenishment of about RM3 billion,\\u201d he said. The same applies even after discounting the one-off financial impact from the cessation of the Berantai Risk Service Contract, which cost Sapura Energy RM52.76 million in the second quarter of financial year 2018. Kong dismissed the recovering trend of oil price as a significant factor presently, amid the long gestation period before oil majors will again roll out capex, and subsequently, jobs. For now, investors\\u2019 money may be better off in other sectors. Analysts agree that O&G valuations are treading an all-time low \\u2014 a fact that has prompted some to wonder if it can be taken advantage of. \\u201cDefinitely not for quick gains,\\u201d said Inter-Pacific\\u2019s Pong. \\u201cRelative to the earnings of counters with low valuation, it is still not enough to excite any significant trading opportunities. You need to be very, very patient.\\u201d Meanwhile, UOB\\u2019s Kong advised investors to stick to earnings-based valuation when making investment decisions. In the upstream segment, the research house has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) player Bumi Armada Bhd for its international exposure, and ahead of its earnings rerating upon the execution of two FPSOs, Kraken and Olomendo, by the first quarter of 2018. \\u201cWe also like Petronas Dagangan Bhd for its defensive nature in the low oil price environment,\\u201d said Kong. AmInvestment\\u2019s Goh opined that a fruitful Opec meeting tomorrow to extend output cuts will help support oil prices at current levels, which may in turn strengthen the sentiment of sectoral recovery and upstream investment decisions by oil majors. \\u201cBut Petronas has already indicated its intention to spend more downstream, not upstream,\\u201d said Goh. On that note, the house is sticking to Yinson Holdings Bhd for its visible revenue generating contracts, and Dialog Group Bhd amid the promising downstream prospects moving forward."}, "136": {"date_posted": "28/11/2017", "title": "Carimin down 5.48% on 1Q losses", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 28): Shares in Carimin Petroleum Bhd dropped 5.48% this morning, following the release of its first quarter results yesterday.

Quarterly revenue, too, grew 34.4% to RM49.5 million from RM36.84 million in 3QFY17, driven by growth from its trade facilitation business \\u2018e-Work Permit\\u2019 as well as the VEP and VC systems. \\u201cHowever, the increased revenue in IT segment was offset by lower revenue recognition in OGPC Sdn Bhd and lower progressive billing of oilfield drilling services to Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd during the current year quarter,\\u201d said DNex. \\u201cThe group\\u2019s energy division was affected by the lower level of upstream activities as a result of overall market softness of the oil and gas (O&G) industry,\\u201d it added.

DNex clarified that the higher earnings posted in 9MFY16 was due to the one-off share of pre-acquisition gain of excess fair value of RM85.3 million resulted from the completion of acquisition in PING Petroleum Ltd. Save the one-off gain, the group\\u2019s profit before tax (PBT) increased more than two folds to RM48.2 million in the nine-month period compared with RM21 million, it added. Revenue rose 28.15% to RM142.44 million from RM111.15 million a year ago, mainly contributed by the full consolidation of OGPC\\u2019s result and progressive billing of oilfield drilling services under the Umbrella contract to Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd. On prospects, DNex said that it expects to perform well \\u201cin tandem with the improving crude oil price outlook\\u201d. Meanwhile, it will continue to broaden its product range under the IT segment, particularly in the business-to-business (B2B) segment to complement the company\\u2019s position in delivering business-to-government (B2G) services. \\u201cThe new recurring income from operation and maintenance of the VEP and RC System, e-Work Permits, and the 1Trade, a web-based one-stop portal for total cargo and trade management and related services has opened up a new revenue stream for the group,\\u201d said DNex.

However, analysts opine that this will be mitigated in the short term. \\u201cWithout his (Mokhzani\\u2019s) disposal, fundamentally, the share price should be higher,\\u201d says AmInvestment analyst Alex Goh. MIDF Research analyst Aaron Tan concurs. Mokhzani\\u2019s share sale at a discount is a \\u201cnormal business decision\\u201d, he says. \\u201cThe disposal seems natural. He had not held a top position in the company since 2015.\\u201d The day the news broke, Sapura Energy was among the top losers and the most traded counters. Its share price fell 17 sen or 10.5% to its intra-day low of RM1.45 on Nov 2 \\u2014 its biggest one-day loss since August 2015 \\u2014 but later recovered to RM1.49, down 8.02%, with 79.85 million shares traded. Mokhzani had offered to sell the shares, held by his British Virgin Island-registered company, Khasera Baru Ltd, at between RM1.42 and RM1.49 apiece. CIMB was appointed the sole book runner for the deal, Reuters reported. Last Tuesday, Mokhzani ceased to be a substantial shareholder in Sapura Energy after Khasera Baru sold 384.97 million shares for RM577.46 million or RM1.42 apiece, which was below its closing price of RM1.50. After the sale, Khasera Baru is left with 220.03 million shares or a 3.67% stake. Mokhzani still holds 0.16% equity interest in the company. Another of his private vehicle, Kencana Capital Sdn Bhd, holds 0.08%. Sapura Energy has continued trending downwards since, closing one sen or 0.69% lower at RM1.45 last Friday. Khasera Baru obtained the shares from Khasera Baru Sdn Bhd \\u2014 also owned by Mokhzani \\u2014 back in July 2015 through a share transfer, Bursa Malaysia filing shows. The latest share disposal by Khasera Baru could be at a loss for Mokhzani. This is the second time he is selling a substantial stake in Sapura Energy, formerly known as SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd. Sapura Energy shares held by Mokhzani and Khasera Baru were first made available to them during the merger exercise between Kencana Petroleum Bhd and SapuraCrest Petroleum Bhd, in which they were shareholders. The merger was done through special purpose vehicle Integral Key Sdn Bhd in May 2012, with the owners of both companies receiving cash payments and shares in the merged entity. Kencana Petroleum was offered RM5.98 billion or RM3 per share \\u2014 via RM969 million cash and 2.51 billion shares in SapuraKencana Petroleum at an indicative price of RM2 apiece. The deal valued Khasera Baru\\u2019s 31.81% stake in the company at around RM1.9 billion. Minus the cash portion, Khasera Baru received 795.32 million shares or a 13.27% stake in the merged entity, valued at RM1.59 billion. Mokhzani got 9.49 million shares or a 0.16% stake. On Feb 18, 2014, Khasera Baru sold 190.3 million SapuraKencana shares at RM4.30 apiece or RM820 million in total. Khasera Baru netted a profit of RM439 million in that deal. The timing then was good \\u2014 crude prices crashed seven months later that year. Since then, shares of Sapura Energy have slumped amid the global oil glut. The stock has yet to recover. The latest share disposal by Mokhzani did raise some eyebrows, considering Sapura Energy\\u2019s share price is currently hovering at its five-year low. Furthermore, Mokhzani\\u2019s exit came at a time when the price of Brent crude oil is recovering. Brent crude breached the US$60-per-barrel mark in end-October and was trading above US$63 per barrel last Friday. On that note, AmInvestment Bank\\u2019s Goh opines that Sapura Energy\\u2019s prospects, too, will be brighter, after a worse-than-expected performance in the first half of its financial year ending Jan 31, 2018 (FY2018). Earnings recovery is likely to come from Sapura Energy\\u2019s exploration and production segment, he says. The group\\u2019s website shows that it has four blocks of production assets off Kerteh, Terengganu, and five exploration assets in Sabah and Sarawak. \\u201cConsidering the assets it acquired from Newfield previously and other production sharing contracts with Petronas, the company can definitely benefit from higher realised prices per barrel. \\u201cOn top of that, higher oil prices should boost investor confidence, especially when talking to banks for future financing,\\u201d says Goh, who places a fair value of RM1.54 on the counter. MIDF\\u2019s Tan concurs, but points out that Sapura Energy\\u2019s drilling segment will continue to go through a gestation period before its clients are sufficiently convinced of market prospects to give out more contracts. \\u201cThe drilling segment is still making losses as its tender rigs are not fully utilised. They are maintaining their vessel count,\\u201d he says. Sapura Energy has guided analysts that it will see only five rigs utilised by end-FY2018, from six in September. Just last month, it bought over a heavy-lift and pipelay vessel, Sapura 3000, after discontinuing its joint venture with London-based Subsea 7 SA. Tan also expects Sapura Energy\\u2019s engineering and construction segment to see weaker yard utilisation rate in the coming quarters with the completion of some major projects in 3QFY2018. He has a \\u201cneutral\\u201d call on the stock, with a target price of RM1.69. Bloomberg data shows that analyst coverage is broadly mixed on the counter, with three \\u201csell\\u201d, five \\u201chold\\u201d and four \\u201cbuy\\u201d calls.

For starters, THHE may have to acquire another asset to help it generate revenue, as its only other asset capable of generating revenue is a 56.79-acre fabrication yard in Pulau Indah, Klang, Selangor, that has been blacklisted from Petroliam Nasional Bhd contracts since April last year. In fact, in October this year, THHE announced that on Oct 9, THHE Fabricators Sdn Bhd \\u2014 a wholly-owned subsidiary \\u2014 had received a letter from Petronas, excluding it from being a main contractor for major fabrication works; engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning works; engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commission works; procurement, construction, installation and commissioning works; and procurement, construction and commissioning works. \\u201cPursuant to the above exclusion, and so long as THHE Fabricators remains excluded, Petronas (including its subsidiaries) and Petroleum Arrangement Contractors shall not award any new contract to THHE Fabricators for the above scopes and THHE Fabricators shall not be allowed to participate in any tender related to the above scopes,\\u201d THHE said. The fabrication yard in Pulau Indah has a net book value of RM138.3 million as at end-2016. It is not clear what the company plans to do with its only remaining asset. THHE, after much lobbying, has 49% of a joint venture with Destini Bhd to undertake the supply, delivery, testing and commissioning of three offshore patrol vessels valued at RM738.9 million, but how well this contract is doing is not known as the company\\u2019s earnings are very weak. \\u00a0 In dire straits? Things have not exactly been going well at THHE. It managed to obtain an extension of three months from Aug 23 \\u2014 a second extension \\u2014 for its creditor\\u2019s scheme. This means that it has about a month to come up with a plan or some form of compromise with its creditors. For the first half of FY2017 ended June, THHE suffered a net loss of RM37.97 million from only RM4.63 million in revenue. As at end-June, the company had RM22.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. However, it had short-term debt commitments of RM295.1 million and long-term borrowings amounting to RM55.12 million with accumulated losses of RM532.64 million. Much of its revival hinges on the FPSO. \\u201cFabrication contracts were too lumpy and the FPSO was acquired to provide a steady stream of income for THHE, but that hasn\\u2019t quite panned out as planned,\\u201d the oil and gas industry source says. THHE acquired the FPSO, Deep Producer 1, (formerly the 68,000dwt tanker MV Laurita) in July 2011, at a cost of US$82.5 million, which was about 40% of the US$200 million the previous owners spent building the vessel. However, the FPSO was acquired without a locked-in charter contract and burnt in the region of RM2 million a month. The FPSO bagged a US$900 million contract from JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration only in May of 2014, and it was slated to be deployed at the Layang oil and gas field, located in Block SK10 off Sarawak. However, the conversion cost was some US$230 million, or RM875 million back then. The FPSO was to have been ready last year, but THHE managed to get an extension for another two years \\u2014 until 2018 \\u2014 after which the FPSO was to be leased to JX Nippon until November 2023, with an option to extend the lease up to October 2033, annually. At calculations and exchange rates back then, the JX Nippon contract was to provide\\u00a0 THHE recurring income of about RM70 million. But with talk of the FPSO being sold, its revenue stream seems less clear. Worse still, its debts are mounting. The company has a RM240 million sukuk facility, which is secured via a mortgage on the FPSO and the long-term leasehold land and buildings, and is pegged with a coupon rate of 7% per annum. Some RM170 million of the sukuk facility was to be repaid via bullet repayments in September last year, which was also the maturity date, but THHE managed to obtain a one-year extension for the repayment, that is from September 2016 till September 2017, as the company announced that it was in the midst of finalising a scheme with its creditors, including the sukuk holders. \\u00a0 Pilgrim fund unlikely to pump more money into THHE THHE\\u2019s 29.81% shareholder, pilgrim fund Lembaga Tabung Haji (LTH), was the sole subscriber for THHE\\u2019s cash call \\u2014 Islamic irredeemable convertible preference shares (ICPS) \\u2014 in 2015. To recap, THHE had issued 1.19 billion renounceable rights issue of new Islamic ICPS of 25 sen par value at an issue price of 25 sen on the basis of 16 ICPS for every 15 shares held in THHE, with a tenure of five years. LTH subscribed for 99.75% of the 1.1 billion ICPS offered and raised RM275 million for THHE. This means that LTH will control 64.57% of the company if the preference shares are converted. The preference shares can be converted at any time within the five-year tenure. Considering LTH is sitting on a huge loss with THHE, it is unlikely more money will be pumped in. LTH got into this position when it bought into Ramunia Holdings Bhd, the previous incarnation of\\u00a0 THHE, in 2008. To recap, early that year, MISC Bhd proposed to inject its oil and gas unit, Malaysia Machine and Heavy Engineering Sdn Bhd, into fabricator Ramunia in a reverse takeover. The proposal, valued at RM3.2 billion, was called off after MISC announced that there were unsatisfactory due diligence findings. LTH turned out to be the biggest loser as it got stuck with almost 29.7% of Ramunia\\u2019s stock and showed a paper loss of some RM175 million back then, having aggressively accumulated Ramunia shares before the deal fell through and with Ramunia shedding over 70% of its market capitalisation after MISC pulled out. MISC had postponed the completion of its due diligence three times before calling off the deal, which should have been indication enough that not all was well with Ramunia. LTH emerged as a substantial shareholder in Ramunia in early November 2007, two months before the deal with MISC was announced, and aggressively accumulated shares for a good one year until December 2008. \\u00a0"}, "150": {"date_posted": "26/10/2017", "title": "Marine & General jumps 4.25% on Carigali contract extension ", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Oct 26): Marine & General Bhd shares jumped 4.25% early this morning after Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd (PCSB) \\u00a0extended by another year a contract awarded to the company for the provision of two anchor handling tug supply vessels.

According to DRealty CEO Brian Iskandar Zulkarim, the IFM business is highly diversified \\u2014 from facilities management services to maintenance and operations and car park solutions. \\u201cOur potential in this sector is huge. This is why IFM is the linchpin of our strategic restructuring plan. We are focusing on synergising our speciality in project management consultancy and IFM in order to deliver a great value proposition to our clients,\\u201d Brian says in an email response to The Edge. The IFM division\\u2019s subsidiaries include Metro Parking (M) Sdn Bhd, HC Duraclean Sdn Bhd (HCD) and TMR Urusharta (M) Sdn Bhd. Apart from these three areas, DRealty plans to venture into other segments of the industry, including security, cabin management, waste management and food and beverage management, says Brian. \\u201cThe integration of our facilities management subsidiaries allowed us to become a one-stop solutions provider to our clients and has generated new opportunities for us to [enter] new business sectors under the IFM umbrella. \\u201cToday, we are able to provide a great value proposition to our clients, with services encompassing all related areas of facilities management \\u2014 from planning and development to maintenance and operations, car park solutions and management of assets,\\u201d he says. Brian was appointed group CEO of DRealty in September last year. He was previously the general manager of Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd\\u2019s (MAHB) transformation management office. At MAHB, he helped to turn around its facilities management subsidiary, Urusan Teknologi Wawasan Sdn Bhd, where he was CEO. \\u201cThe contribution from property projects varies over time, depending on progress billing and completion rate, while IFM brings in a stable recurring income. So, the strong growth in IFM will drive DRealty\\u2019s performance,\\u201d he says. DRealty\\u2019s IFM division has performed significantly better than last year, with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) growing more than 30%, he says. However, DRealty\\u2019s accounts show that the segment, while profitable, may not have the heft to change the group\\u2019s fortunes. For the six months to June 30 (1HFY2017), the IFM division recorded a profit of RM988,000, compared with RM1.88 million a year ago, despite revenue rising 20.7% to RM99.1 million. This compares with the property segment\\u2019s profit of RM6.05 million and the group\\u2019s consolidated profit of RM4.762 million. As at June 30, DRealty had a debt ratio of 0.73 times. The decrease in profit, despite higher revenue, is due to high initial operating costs, mainly manpower, DRealty says in its financial statement for the second quarter of financial year 2017 (2QFY2017). \\u201cWe registered a lower profit in the first half of the year compared with the [previous] corresponding period due to the nature of most IFM projects. The initial cost of operations outlay during the early stages is high, along with thinner profit margins,\\u201d says Brian. In 1QFY2017 ended March 31, the property services and parking divisions made a combined profit of RM119,000, compared with a combined profit of RM2.27 million in the previous corresponding quarter. In 1HFY2017, the IFM division\\u2019s revenue was lifted by a 92.1% increase in contribution from engineering and maintenance services, due primarily to a contract at Petronas\\u2019 Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) in Pengerang, Johor. To recap, in September last year, TMR LC Services Sdn Bhd, a 70:30 joint venture between TMR and LC Catering Sdn Bhd, received a contract from Petronas Refinery and Petrochemical Corporation Sdn Bhd, for the operation and maintenance of RAPID\\u2019s temporary executive village and temporary management office facilities and infrastructure worth RM124 million. In July this year, Petronas\\u2019 subsidiary, PRPC Utilities and Facilities Sdn Bhd, awarded a contract to provide security management services for RAPID to a consortium of which TMR is a member. The contract is worth RM26.2 million and can be extended to include additional services worth RM9.77 million. Last month, TMR, in a joint venture with KPJ Healthcare Bhd\\u2019s Kumpulan Perubatan (Johor) Sdn Bhd, was awarded a contract to manage a small medical facility in RAPID for 39 months by PRPC Utilities and Facilities for RM27.6 million. The contract includes an optional services contract worth RM7.8 million. Meanwhile, in July, Metro Parking (S) Pte Ltd, 70%-owned by Metro Parking, received a five-year contract to operate and manage car parks at the Singapore Sport Council\\u2019s sport centres, worth RM56.6 million. \\u201cTMR and HCD manage over 10 million sq ft of property and assets for clients, including the government and government-linked companies, throughout Malaysia. In the coming years, IFM will provide the impetus to DRealty\\u2019s growth,\\u201d says Brian. The facilities management market in Malaysia has been experiencing strong growth, driven by rapid urbanisation. From 2011 to 2015, the market grew more than 8% annually to an industry value of over RM4 billion, he says. The facilities management industry will grow more than 8% per year over the next three years, he adds. On the surface, there is huge opportunity in the country for IFM companies, due to the large number of commercial properties, healthcare facilities and infrastructure being developed. However, the type facilities management contracts the companies secure determines their profitability. Apart from DRealty, there are at least three other Bursa Malaysia-listed companies involved in the IFM industry. These include UEM Edgenta Bhd, AWC Bhd and GFM Services Bhd. All of these companies were profitable as at end-June this year. UEM Edgenta is the biggest of the four. In 2QFY2017, the group\\u2019s IFM segments \\u2014 consisting of healthcare, infrastructure and real estate services \\u2014 made a combined profit before tax (PBT) of RM48.5 million, from a combined revenue of RM469.3 million. AWC\\u2019s facilities division made a profit of RM14.3 million during the quarter on the back of RM135.2 million in revenue. GFM, which debuted on Bursa Malaysia last December, made a PBT of RM3.45 million in 2QFY2017, on RM26 million in revenue. Past and current projects for DRealty\\u2019s property business include Taman Damansara Aliff in Johor and Damansara Hills in Kuantan. DRealty is also partnering Country Garden Real Estate Sdn Bhd (CGRE), a unit of China-based Country Garden Holdings Company Ltd, to develop an integrated township on a 53-acre tract in Tebrau, Johor, with a gross development value of RM3.5 billion. The project, called Central Park, will eventually comprise 10,000 residential units, commercial units and amenities, to be developed over several phases in six to eight years. Phase 1 of the project was launched in March. According to Brian, the construction of Phase 1 is ongoing and on schedule. The project, in which DRealty owns a 30% stake in the joint venture with CGRE, is expected to start contributing to the group\\u2019s earnings next year, he says. \\u201cOur priority is to identify those projects that improve our margins and contribute to our cash flow and bottom line. In tandem, we are expanding our project management and consultancy capability to support the group\\u2019s property development projects. \\u201cGoing forward, the momentum from our property segment should continue. We have identified catalyst projects that will play important roles in further improving our cash flow and profitability,\\u201d says Brian. DRealty closed at 54.5 sen last Thursday, giving the group a market capitalisation of RM168.6 million. Thursday\\u2019s share price was 3.8% higher than at the start of the year, although the stock reached a 52-week high of 92.5 sen on March 10. DRealty\\u2019s largest shareholder is Datuk Daing A Malek Daing A Rahaman via a 51% interest in Seaview Holdings Bhd.

There is nothing unusual about this as it had happened in the run-up to past elections. These are stocks that are perceived to have a political flavour or have the potential to benefit from a good performance at the ballot box by the incumbents. But without actual newsflow or a tangible improvement in earnings, the lofty pre-election valuations of such stocks tend to struggle after the ballots are cast. Once the hype passes, investors may come to realise that the rally was not supported by the companies\\u2019 fundamentals, and gradually their share prices come down. For example, Utusan Melayu (Malaysia) Bhd saw its share price rise 30% between Jan 4, 2012, and March 29, 2012, a period of 44 days. Then it dropped from 91 sen to 58.5 sen just before the 13th general election was held on May 5, 2013. The same trend was also seen in the run-up to the 12th general election, in 2007 and 2008. Utusan\\u2019s share price surged 38.9% between March 5, 2007, and July 25, 2007, to RM1.32. It later retracted to 97.2 sen, a drop of 26% in just 17 days. The stock continued its downward trend until the end of 2008, losing 37.2% of its market value along the way. Utusan\\u2019s largest shareholder is Umno, the biggest component party of Barisan Nasional, with a 49.77% stake. The group\\u2019s publications are the mouthpieces of the ruling coalition, especially in Peninsular Malaysia. The pre-election rally also occurred this time round for Utusan. Between March 7 and April 27, its share price jumped 78% to its peak this year at 68.5 sen. The stock retracted by 42.3% to 39.5 sen last Friday. Utusan has been in the red since 2012, when it recorded a net loss of RM16 million on the back of RM349.2 million in revenue. In the second quarter ended June 30, 2017 (2QFY2017), its net loss narrowed to RM10.7 million from RM16.3 million in the previous corresponding quarter. Other companies that have had the effect of a pre-election rally include Petra Energy Bhd, KUB Malaysia Bhd, George Kent (M) Bhd, Fajarbaru Builder Group Bhd, Iris Corp Bhd, Thriven Global Bhd, Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor Bhd and Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd. However, it cannot be said that all stocks that experienced a rally before an election fall after the polls. The fate of the company\\u2019s share price, whether it falls or soars, depends on the outcome of the election and the government\\u2019s policies. For instance, Petra Energy\\u2019s share price continued to soar even after the 13th general election was held in May 2013. The stock rose 25.95% to RM1.30 from March 18, 2013, to May 3, 2013 \\u2014 the last trading day before the election was held. As BN \\u2014 led for the first time by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak \\u2014 was returned with a mandate to continue governing the country, albeit with a smaller majority, Petra Energy\\u2019s share price continued to rise, reaching RM2.19 on July 18, 2013. The stock peaked at RM2.73 on June 19, 2014. The group\\u2019s largest shareholder is Tan Sri Bustari Yusuf with a 27.54% stake, followed by Wah Seong Corp Bhd (26.97%). Lembaga Tabung Haji owned a 9.88% stake in Petra Energy and Datuk Mohamed Nizam Abdul Razak, 9.11%, as at April 3. Nizam is Najib\\u2019s younger brother. The sustainable run of Petra Energy\\u2019s share price between March 2013 and June 2014 was because of big-ticket contracts, including the hook-up, commissioning and topside major maintenance services (2013-2018) awarded by Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd. Petra Energy has seen two rallies so far this year. The first was from Jan 31 to April 25 \\u2014 the group\\u2019s share price rose 38.9% to RM1.25, before retreating 25.2% to settle at 93.5 sen on Aug 24. Between then and last Tuesday, the stock has risen 20.86% to RM1.13. However, it fell 6.2% over the next two days to RM1.06. It traded unchanged last Friday. Petra Energy reported a net loss of RM117.3 million in its financial year ended Dec 31, 2016 \\u2014 the first full-year loss since it was listed in 2007. As at June 30, the group recorded a net profit of RM8.4 million. Another company that rallied after a general election was My E.G. Services Bhd, which relies heavily on government contracts. Between May 2, 2013, and Dec 31, 2013, its share price surged 222.42% to 43.2 sen. This time around, MyEG\\u2019s share price rose 102.22% to RM2.30 from July 25, 2016, to May 16, 2017. The stock has been hovering between RM1.96 and RM2.30 since then. It closed at RM2.05 last Friday.

The letter is another blow to TFSB, which is currently facing a two-year ban from participating in tenders by Petronas Carigali since April 4, 2016, due to what Petronas Carigali described as \\u201cnon-performance\\u201d on TFSB\\u2019s part under the same contract.\\u00a0 Now, the national oil company has excluded TFSB from being a main contractor, conducting major fabrication works, as well as any engineering, procurement, construction, installation, and/or commissioning works, not just for all its subsidiaries, but also for any Petroleum Arrangement Contractors (PACs). The exclusion takes effect from the date of the letter, THHE said. \\u201cPetronas, including its subsidiaries and PACs, shall not award any new contract to TFSB for the above scopes and TFSB shall not be allowed to participate in any tender related to the above scopes,\\u201d THHE added. \\u201cThe letter also states that the upliftment of the exclusion will be subject to TFSB satisfactorily meeting Petronas\\u2019 requirements, which were not mentioned in the letter,\\u201d it added. THHE said it will seek clarification from Petronas, as the contract mentioned had been novated to a third party on Oct 24, 2016, with the consent of Petronas Carigali \\u2014 and that the third party had assumed all rights, interests and responsibilities under the contract. \\u201cThe contract\\u2019s performance now rests with the third party. The novation also released and discharged TFSB from all liabilities under the contract, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the novation agreement,\\u201d the filing added.

Petronas Carigali first awarded the PH II Kinabalu contract to TFSB on Jan 28, 2014. When it received the two-year exclusion from Petronas Carigali, THHE argued at that time, saying the project had achieved an onshore construction completion of approximately 91%, but to no avail.

Brent price rose to US$59 (RM248.98) per barrel last Monday, but slipped to US$57.58 per barrel last Friday, although still far off its 10-month low of US$44 per barrel in June. A possibility that the Opec could extend production cuts at its next meeting on Nov 30 has helped maintain oil price at the current level. Analysts are expecting oil price to average US$50 per barrel in 2017. Given the recent run-up in share prices, most analysts are of the view that the O&G stocks have limited upside potential. They believe selective purchases of O&G stocks are probably the best stance to take at this juncture. A consensus view is that companies with stable earnings and low reliance on oil producers\\u2019 capital expenditure (capex) are likely to be the best bets. These include companies in the midstream energy sector such as floating production storage and offloading players. Downstream engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning companies, as well as petrochemical and retail companies, are also expected to thrive in a low-oil-price environment. According to AmInvestment Bank Equity Research analyst Alex Goh, more investments are being done in the downstream O&G subsegment, developing petrochemical refineries and tanks. The development of the US$27 billion Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex (PIPC) in Johor is seen as the catalyst for the downstream subsegment, while Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u2019s (Petronas) roll-out of maintenance, construction and modification (MCM) contracts for its facilities at PIPC in the third quarter of 2017 was a catalyst for the upstream O&G subsegment. However, Goh opined that the PIPC will only benefit select O&G players, at least in the short to medium term. \\u201cOver time, the projects can witness a critical mass that will benefit other companies not directly involved right now,\\u201d he told The Edge Financial Daily. \\u201cBut at this juncture, it is not incremental to the sector as a whole,\\u201d he added. Goh likes Dialog Group Bhd even though the stock is trading at a 2018 forward price-earnings ratio (PER) of 26 times, below its five-year peak of 29 times. \\u201cWe view the premium as justified given Dialog\\u2019s long-term recurring cash flow-generating businesses, which are largely cushioned from volatile crude oil price cycles, and further underpinned by the Pengerang development\\u2019s multi-year value expansion,\\u201d he said in a report dated Aug 16. He also has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d rating on Yinson Holdings Bhd, noting that the stock currently trades at a bargain 2018 forward PER of 12 times versus over 20 times for Dialog and Sapura Energy Bhd. Affin Hwang Investment Bank analyst Tan Jianyuan concurred, noting that the market is in a rebalancing stage of supply and demand, with O&G companies seeing their revenue grow in the first half of 2017 amid more jobs being dished out albeit at a \\u201cslow pace\\u201d. \\u201cWhile contract flows this year are tracking to surpass 2016 levels, we believe they are still rather lacklustre. Besides that, service providers in the O&G sector continue to see their earnings lag behind their valuations, making them not appealing, apart from a select few names,\\u201d he said. Tan\\u2019s top picks are Bumi Armada Bhd, Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd and Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd. He expects Brent price to be in a range of US$50 to US$55 per barrel in 2017 and US$55 to US$60 per barrel in 2018. Meanwhile, analysts note that O&G players in the upstream subsegment continued to face pressure as seen in their earnings, which did not improve much in the second quarter of 2017. Apart from a select few, asset-heavy companies in the upstream O&G subsegment such as Sapura Energy still suffer from low utilisation, low charter rates and unexciting realised oil price, they added. In a report last Friday, MIDF Research said despite the comparatively stronger global crude oil price, activity level in the offshore O&G sphere was still subdued. \\u201cDue to the persistent struggle in global crude oil price to make meaningful upside recovery, relatively low upstream activities and charter rates stress on offshore heavy assets, we are maintaining our negative stance on the upstream O&G subsegment,\\u201d the research firm said. Affin Hwang\\u2019s Tan downgraded Sapura Energy to \\u201csell\\u201d from \\u201chold\\u201d as the company reported a lower core net profit year-on-year in the second quarter ended July 31, 2017, dragged down by weaker drilling and exploration and production divisions. \\u201cWe believe that the recent share price performance is not reflective of its current fundamentals (trading at a forward 60 times financial year 2018 PER), but rather of sentiment,\\u201d he said in a note dated Sept 28. Tan believes the share price and earnings of other O&G stocks have also yet to bottom out. Counters deemed as trading at a premium by him include Petra Energy Bhd and Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd, he said in a separate report dated Sept 19. Citing cash flow deterioration for 14 listed companies with O&G exposure in the second quarter of 2017, Tan is maintaining a \\u201cneutral\\u201d call on the overall sector \\u201cas valuations continue to trade at a premium of 31 times forward PER\\u201d. Goh, meanwhile, pointed out that fabricators, offshore engineering and construction service companies and offshore support vessel operators are still waiting for oil price recovery \\u2014 and subsequently capex spending of oil majors \\u2014 before any lucrative contracts can come in. He has a \\u201chold\\u201d rating on Bumi Armada and Sapura Energy. Petronas, for example, reportedly said it would allocate RM60 billion for capex in 2017, up 17% from a year ago \\u2014 but the bulk of it goes to downstream projects as part of its effort to future-proofing its overall portfolio, a decision it said is also being undertaken by competitors. An analyst with a local investment bank opined that the RM6 billion worth of MCM roll-out, which is a continuation of existing service contracts, will not be as impactful as anticipated. \\u201cThe figure looks large, but I doubt the value will be meaningful. The contracts, which are split over five years, will be further divided into smaller sizes to be awarded to many different players,\\u201d he said. UOB Kay Hian senior analyst Kong Ho Meng is maintaining a \\u201cmarket weight\\u201d call on the O&G sector. \\u201cWe maintain our sector theme of setting take-profit levels if stock valuation is not supported by earnings rerating.\\u201d"}, "166": {"date_posted": "27/9/2017", "title": "Selldown in equities a \\u2018buying opportunity\\u2019", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: The recent declines in local equities along with the global markets amid escalating tensions between North Korea and the US are seen by market analysts as a buying opportunity. The FBM KLCI has been on a downtrend since mid-September and slipped 3.55 points yesterday to close at 1,765.59 points. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s a knee-jerk reaction from the market following the heightened tension between the US and North Korea. I think the selldown is a buying opportunity for investors,\\u201d Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president Vincent Lau told The Edge Financial Daily over the telephone. North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said on Monday in New York that US President Donald Trump had declared war on North Korea and that Pyongyang reserves the right to take countermeasures. \\u201cSince the US declared war on our country, we will have every right to make all self-defensive countermeasures, including the right to shoot down US strategic bombers at any time even when they are not yet inside the aerospace border of our country,\\u201d Ri said. The comments made by Ri were in reference to Trump\\u2019s tweets on Saturday saying that he and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un \\u201cwon\\u2019t be around much longer\\u201d if they acted on their threats. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has responded to Ri\\u2019s comments by saying that the accusation that a declaration of war is made by the US is absurd. According to Lau, despite the exchange of words between the two countries, there are about four to five other ways that the North Korean crisis could be resolved according to most reports and going to war is still not the base case scenario at the moment. Lau also pointed out that despite the decline seen in the technology (tech) and semiconductor sectors, there is still room to grow. However, he agreed that there are those who have jumped on the bandwagon of the oil and gas (O&G) sector as they switched from tech and semiconductor companies, taking profit after a good run in their share prices this year. \\u201cWith the recovery seen in the oil price, the momentum in the O&G counters is good and should be sustained. While there are those who have taken profit and rotated from the semiconductor and tech players to O&G, I think the tech counters still have legs to go. This recent selldown seen in the tech counters in the US is more of a correction,\\u201d he added. Besides the oil price rally that saw crude oil prices rise past US$59 (RM248.18) a barrel, Lau said that expectations of awards of maintenance, construction and modification (MCM) contracts by Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) to O&G support service providers also provided the catalyst for the run-up among O&G counters. O&G counters including Hibiscus Petroleum Bhd, Sumatec Resources Bhd and UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd dominated Bursa Malaysia\\u2019s most active list yesterday.\\u00a0 Hibiscus gained 5.6% to 66.5 sen with 206.1 million shares traded, Sumatec was unchanged at six sen with 62.3 million shares traded, and UMW O&G fell 7.4% to 31.5 sen with 93.9 million shares traded. Hibiscus, UMW O&G and Sumatec were Bursa Malaysia\\u2019s second, fourth and ninth most active stocks respectively. Affin Hwang Investment Bank analyst Tan Jianyuan said the momentum seen in the O&G counters was a result of strong news flow rather than fundamental improvements. \\u201cIt\\u2019s more of the second liners or cheaper stocks that are seeing these gains even though fundamentally, they are still suffering.\\u201d Crude oil prices rose past US$59 a barrel, its highest level in two years, before moderating to US$58.66 at the time of writing, supported by Turkey\\u2019s threat to cut crude flows from Iraq\\u2019s Kurdistan region to the outside world. Affin Hwang Asset Management portfolio manager Khoo Hsien Liang said despite the heightened geopolitical tension, the company\\u2019s investment position remains unchanged and it would look to add if there are compelling discounts or when value emerges. Khoo added that while the market reacted to the North Korean-US standoff, other factors were at play including Germany\\u2019s election results, property cooling measures in China and profit-taking in the tech sectors.\\u00a0 \\u201cMarkets have responded negatively, mainly as a result of knee-jerk reactions. However, it\\u2019s difficult to fully attribute current market weakness to just North Korea as other factors were at play,\\u201d he added The MSCI\\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell as much as 0.5% to a near three-week low and was last down 0.3% following losses on Wall Street. The KLCI fell by 0.2% or 3.55 points to 1,765.59 points, the lowest level since Aug 29 when it was hovering at 1,761.14. The FBM Top 100 Index, the FBM Mid-70 Index, the FBM Small Cap Index and the FBM ACE Index have all also fallen by 0.27%, 0.47%, 0.41% and 0.89% respectively. Another analyst who declined to be named pointed to the recovery in the stock market towards the end of the day as a sign that the weakness seen yesterday could be temporary.\\u00a0 \\u201cWe see a spontaneous reaction from the market to a scenario that is deemed as the worst- case scenario [if a war were to break out], but as the day went by and more information is digested, the market slowly rebounded from its intraday low of 1,761.21. I think if the US market were to show some signs of recovery overnight, we should see a rebound in the Malaysian equity market tomorrow (today),\\u201d he said. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, agreed, saying that every aggressive sell-off in the equity market and move to safe havens on geopolitical risks have proven to be short-lived. \\u201cThe best-case scenario is for the US to add more pressure on China and Russia, to increase sanctions against Pyongyang and pressure Kim Jong-un to sit around a negotiation table. However, as an investor, you should keep all options on the table,\\u201d he said.\n\\u00a0"}, "167": {"date_posted": "19/9/2017", "title": "T7 Global active, jumps 7.79% on positive news flow ", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Sept 19): T7 Global Bhd, formerly Tanjung Offshore Bhd, jumped 7.79% in active trade early today after teh company said its investment in Triangle Energy Global Ltd has paid off after it hit oil in the coastal Xanadu-1 well in the Perth Basin.

An acronym for Sistem Kawalan Imigresen Nasional (National Immigration Control System), SKIN is a 15-year concession that was supposed to be the key catalyst that would help to justify the group\\u2019s lofty valuations. But the market does not appear to be convinced. Following the announcement last week, Prestariang\\u2019s share price tumbled almost 12.2% to close at RM2.09 last Thursday, down from the RM2.38 close pre-announcement. Even the group\\u2019s bullish outlook on its existing core businesses did not seem to sway investors. \\u201cWe expect revenue from our software and services segment to grow by 25% in FY2018,\\u201d president and group CEO Dr Abu Hassan Ismail told the press last week. Furthermore, he says the group\\u2019s training and certification business is expected to see revenue double, fuelled by the Prestariang Skill Training Institute (PSTI) in Petronas\\u2019 Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (Rapid) project in Pengerang, Johor. Abu Hassan also assures investors that the group\\u2019s loss-making education arm, UniMY, would break even this year. Last but not least, he made sure to play up educloud \\u2014 Prestariang\\u2019s venture into shared cloud services. But even with partners like Alibaba, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, market response has been tepid. \\u00a0 Why the poor response? For starters, it is important to note that analysts concur Prestariang\\u2019s profits should improve going forward, from the third quarter at least. A report by CIMB Investment Bank anticipates core earnings to expand by 143% year on year to 17 sen per share in FY2018. Even the more conservative estimates by AmInvestment Bank forecasts core earnings per share to rise 80% y-o-y to 11 sen. The trouble is, the earnings upside simply aren\\u2019t enough to justify the stock\\u2019s lofty valuations. As at last Thursday\\u2019s close, Prestariang was valued at a whopping 112 times earnings. Of course, this is expected to fall once the earnings growth trickles in. The fact that Prestariang will only control 70% of the SKIN project did not help matters either. \\u00a0 70% \\u2014 not enough skin in the game For context, it is important to remember that back when news first broke that Prestariang was bidding for the SKIN project, the expected value of the contract was much higher \\u2014 as much as RM6 billion. This helped to drive Prestariang\\u2019s share price to over RM3.20 in early 2016. However, uncertainty over whether it could actually bag the contract brought the share price back down to the RM2.20 level over the past year. The company\\u2019s tumbling earnings (see chart) could not have supported such a high share price either. Investors long in the stock at this point were largely betting on the upside potential of SKIN. Thus, it was a relatively nasty surprise that Prestariang only has a 70% stake in the concession. Recall that the actual concession has been awarded to Prestariang SKIN Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prestariang Services Sdn Bhd. However, Prestariang only controls 70% of Prestariang Services. Another 30% of the company is controlled equally by Muhammad Nagib Gopal Abdullah, Raja Azmi Adam Nadarajan and Faisalludin Mohamat Yusuff. When asked why a 30% stake was given to these three individuals, Abu Hassan simply says, \\u201cThese are the original founding members.\\u201d \\u201cThey are not somebody else. They were actually physically with us from day one, and they continue to be with us to add value to make sure they deliver SKIN as part of their commitment to the government.\\u201d Note that Raja Azmi is the CEO of Prestariang SKIN. Whatever the reason however, the financial impact of giving away 30% of the project has not gone down well with investors. Not only will this dilute the earnings from the concession, but Prestariang is expected to bear the entire cost of funding the project\\u2019s construction, approximately RM1billion over 36 months. Assuming the project is 80% financed by debt, a 6% interest rate translates into RM95 million in accrued interest over the first three years of the project. To make matters worse, the exact returns on the project are rather opaque since the internal rate of return (IRR) is not disclosed. \\u201cWe have signed a non-disclosure agreement with the government. We are not allowed to reveal the project\\u2019s IRR,\\u201d Abu Hassan tells The Edge. Instead, he simply guides that the project would reap about RM3.5 billion in revenue from year 4 to year 15 of the project. A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that works out to RM204.2 million per annum over the 12-year period. According to analyst reports, Prestariang\\u2019s management is guiding for a net profit margin of up to 38% a year. That works out to about RM77.6 million a year for the company or 16 sen a share. \\u00a0 No cash call? At the press briefing, Abu Hassan made a bold claim \\u2014 that the entire project could be funded entirely with debt and internally generated funds alone. \\u201cWe have already secured the guarantees from the banks. The government would not award this project to us unless we show proof that we could finance it,\\u201d explains Abu Hassan. An 80:20 debt to equity structure is entirely plausible given that Prestariang is debt free, with RM38.6 million in cash and another RM51.9 million in short-term investments. Assuming the short-term investments can be liquidated at book value, the company has net cash of RM90.5 million. Thus Abu Hassan tells The Edge, \\u201cAs things stand, we do not need to undertake a rights issue or a private placement for this project. Of course, if something happens and we need to raise funds we will.\\u201d However, it is interesting that Prestariang will not be cutting back on dividend payouts. Abu Hassan insists that the group will maintain its 50% dividend payout policy. Assuming the group manages to book the 11 sen to 17 sen earnings per share that analysts forecast, that works out to a payout between RM26.5 million and RM41 million a year. That\\u2019s a pretty sizable cash flow drain. Keep in mind that the SKIN concession has zero cash flow in the first three years. The government only begins to make payments from 2021 onwards. In fact, some analysts are a little more sceptical. AmInvestment Bank\\u2019s report prices in a potential dilution of 18.6% or 90 million new shares issued at RM2 apiece to finance the project. AmInvestment actually downgraded its call on Prestariang to \\u201chold\\u201d with a target price of RM2. Previously, it had made a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call with a target price of RM2.60. This makes AmInvestment\\u2019s call the most conservative on Prestariang. The good news is that the project should have minimal operational risk. Unlike highway concessions for example, which have uncertainty over traffic projections, SKIN\\u2019s revenue projections should be fairly accurate. This would allow the group to borrow at competitive rates. The flipside of course, is that there is minimal earnings upside. \\u201cRight now, the concession includes a provision for us to resize the project at regular intervals, and this has already been priced in. This ensures the system is always able to cope with fluctuations in [immigration] volumes,\\u201d explains Abu Hassan. The only way the RM3.5 billion figure can increase is if the scope of the project grows due to the government adding new border entry points in the future, he explains. \\u00a0 Educloud gets a mixed response Anyone who had the opportunity to sit in on the presentation by Abu Hassan and his team last week would notice immediately that more than half of the slides were dedicated to Prestariang\\u2019s transformation. Key to this transformation, will be educloud \\u2014 a shared cloud services provider targeted at local educational institutions. In simple terms, educloud will enable Malaysian universities to migrate their products, services and data to the cloud. This could range from administrative areas like student enrolment to the education side of the business, like study materials and lectures. In the long run however, educloud\\u2019s vision is to introduce standardised student IDs that the group hopes to monetise through other means like e-commerce or ride-sharing services. Thus far, Prestariang claims it has no trouble soliciting interest from the universities. \\u201cOur problem isn\\u2019t getting interest. Our problem now is making sure we can deliver. The universities see the value in what we are proposing. It can save them millions in costs,\\u201d explains Farad Alhusaini, the cloud system orchestrator for Prestariang Digital Sdn Bhd. Clearly, educloud is on a completely different tack from Prestariang\\u2019s other businesses. Not surprisingly, there are some sceptics. \\u201cIt sounds great, but the immediate worry is whether educloud will be a drag on earnings. How quickly will it start turning a profit?\\u201d one fund manager asks. He points to Prestariang\\u2019s education venture, UniMY, which has been a drag on the group\\u2019s earnings. The good thing about the shared cloud services however, is the fact that it does not require massive capex. \\u201cWe will rely on our partners to build the cloud storage for us \\u2014 Alibaba and Amazon Web Services. We are more like brokers,\\u201d explains Farad. On a positive note, this simply means educloud could achieve scale very quickly. If anything, educloud has the most potential to surprise on the upside going forward. But just like SKIN, this will be new territory for Prestariang and investors will be watching closely to see how well the group can execute such projects. \\u00a0"}, "182": {"date_posted": "1/8/2017", "title": "Mudajaya rises 4.80% on landing Petronas contracts ", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 1): Mudajaya Group Bhd rose 4.80% in early trade after it won two contracts valued at RM151.38 million from Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) to undertake procurement, construction and commissioning (PCC) works for the utilities, interconnecting and offsite (UIO) facilities of the refinery and petrochemical integrated development (Rapid) project in Pengerang, Johor.

Instead, there was a cloud of doubt and scepticism in the foyer of Bursa Malaysia last Tuesday morning as LCT\\u2019s shares began to fall moments after the gong was struck. The petrochemical group\\u2019s share price closed 1.4% lower at RM6.41 last Friday, even with the company snapping up 23.4 million shares to stabilise the price over the week. Clearly, the 22% downsizing of the offering to 580 million shares and the repricing at RM6.50 per share (from initial expectations of RM8) was to blame. But despite the negative sentiment, the entire exercise was far from a disaster. Not only was the deal salvaged, but it also managed to keep to its original timetable. If anything, it showcases the hard work and quick thinking of the investment bankers involved, as well as the flexibility and robustness of the country\\u2019s regulatory framework. In fact, bankers involved in the deal argue that all stakeholders enjoyed positive outcomes from the exercise. At the very least, there were no negative implications from the downsizing and repricing of the initial public offering. That said, the unusual path LTC took to listing certainly demands closer examination \\u2014 what were the circumstances that created this perfect storm? How did the IPO\\u2019s arrangers and promoters negotiate such a swift solution? What are the implications for future listings? Speaking to bankers, regulators and fund managers, The Edge takes a closer look at LCT\\u2019s peculiar listing. \\u00a0 What went wrong? Short answer: Lack of foreign interest in the IPO, and an absolute share price that was too high. Long answer: The foreign investment banks advising on the deal appear to have grossly misjudged foreign institutional interest for LCT\\u2019s offering. One banker familiar with the deal says foreign institutions were initially expected to take up almost 50% of the offering, or almost RM2.95 billion of the RM5.9 billion worth of shares offered (at the initial estimate of RM8 per share). But when it came to the actual book building in late June, most of the foreign \\u201clong funds\\u201d \\u2014 funds that take long positions \\u2014 showed little interest in the placement. Ultimately, foreign institutional investors would take up only 20% of the downsized institutional offering \\u2014 RM710 million worth of shares. That means the global coordinators and joint bookrunners, Credit Suisse and JP Morgan, had overestimated foreign appetite for LCT by a whopping RM2.24 billion. At the same time, the book-building failed to get off the ground with the retail portion of 55.783 million shares undersubscribed by 38%. This has largely been blamed on the uncharacteristically high absolute share price of the IPO. \\u201cOf course, institutional investors don\\u2019t care about absolute share price. They look at the valuation. But for retail investors, this could be a deterrent. And when you go for a listing this size, you definitely don\\u2019t want to alienate any potential investors,\\u201d notes another banker. It is understood that some bankers even pushed for a share split that would have brought the share price down to the RM2 to RM3 range. However, there is a simpler explanation \\u2014 the offering was simply too big for this kind of stock. At the prospective RM8 per share, arrangers would have aimed to raise nearly RM446.26 million from retail investors. Based on RM6.50 per share, only RM224 million was raised from retailers, but that figure will fall as many are expected to accept the company\\u2019s buyback offer. \\u201cThis is not a stock that retail investors typically prefer. Just look at Petronas Chemicals Bhd. It is heavily institutionalised and boring for retail investors. That LCT got as many retail subscriptions as it did is considered pretty good,\\u201d the banker adds. Keep in mind that with sufficient institutional interest, retail undersubscription would not be an issue due to the clawback and reallocation provisions that allow funds to take up the unsubscribed retail shares. \\u00a0 Was the offering too ambitious? Short answer: It was too big for the current market. Long answer: LCT\\u2019s listing was seen as major test for the country\\u2019s capital market after two lacklustre years. It is interesting to note that LCT has an incredibly strong balance sheet \\u2014 with RM1.04 billion in cash and virtually no borrowings. There was no immediate urgency for the IPO, at least one to raise a whopping RM5.9 billion. Around 83% of the proceeds was slated for the construction of a new petrochemical facility in Indonesia over the next three years. A more conservative approach would have been to stagger the fundraising in two rounds. Many smaller and more cautious IPOs in recent years have taken this route \\u2014 following up a relatively small IPO with a rights issue or private placement one or two years down the road. In fact, the downsizing of LCT\\u2019s IPO proves that this was a viable option all along. Nonetheless, some bankers believe the initial sizing and pricing of the offering were not ambitious, given the information at the time. \\u201cRemember, we had the cornerstones come in at RM8. In fact, some had even indicated that they were happy to pay as much as RM8.60. Furthermore, there was no indication that there would be such a poor turnout by foreign funds at the time,\\u201d explains the first banker. He points out that larger IPOs for similar types of companies have been done in the past. Petronas Chemicals managed to raise a record RM12.89 billion in 2010. \\u201cOf course, LCT does not have a parent like Petroliam Nasional Bhd. But it was raising less than half that amount and priced at a discount to PetChem. The size and pricing of the offering was not unreasonable,\\u201d he argues. \\u00a0 Who paid the price? Short answer: Perhaps the investment banks and the promoters, but only very little. Long answer: At face value, almost all stakeholders emerged with positive outcomes from the IPO. Sure, LCT would have liked to have raised more money but, objectively, no one party appears to have been hurt. In fact, an SC spokesperson points out that the transaction actually demonstrates the sophistication and flexibility of Malaysia\\u2019s IPO framework in responding rapidly to market needs without compromising investor protection. After all, retail investors (and bumiputera investors approved by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry) got a pretty good deal \\u2014 a risk-free option to exit at RM6.50. Furthermore, they have the opportunity to observe the post-listing share price until July 18 before deciding. Had the share price improved after listing, retailers would have enjoyed the upside. As for the institutional investors, many were willing to pay RM7.60 to RM8 per share in the first book building. Now, they enjoy a cheaper entry into the stock. Furthermore, they were not forced to participate in the second book building. In addition, the stabilisation action provides an avenue for funds to exit over the first 30 days (or up to 27 million shares). Meanwhile, the investment banks will have to settle for a smaller placement and underwriting fee due to the downsizing of the exercise. Based on the 1.5% fee, and the downsizing of the IPO by RM2.13 billion, the investment banks would lose out on approximately RM32 million worth of fees. In contrast, the total listing expenses were estimated at RM152.9 million. However, this is a small price to pay. \\u201cHad the banks been forced to underwrite the shortfall, we might have had to subscribe for at least US$100 million to US$150 million (RM645 million) worth of shares. The six banks could have taken it on, but it would have been bad for the after-market performance of the shares. The banks would look to get rid of the shares and investors do not like this,\\u201d explains the first banker. Last but not least, LCT itself should not be too displeased by the outcome. Given the lack of foreign interest in the IPO, it is commendable that the deal was still closed, carried primarily by domestic funds. Even though it was downsized to RM3.77 billion, LCT\\u2019s listing is still the largest in the region in recent years. \\u00a0 What are the implications? Short answer: LCT\\u2019s listing is unprecedented but unlikely to make future IPOs easier. Long answer: LCT\\u2019s path to listing was certainly unconventional and it put the regulator\\u2019s flexibility to the test. Despite the massive changes made to the IPO, it did not trigger Section 238 of the Capital Markets and\\u00a0 Services Act, which would have required the filing of a supplementary prospectus. This would certainly have delayed the listing. And an extended delay would have risked scuttling the entire exercise. However, the circumstances surrounding LCT\\u2019s listing were unique. It is highly unlikely that future IPOs will be able to pull off a similar stunt. This is largely due to the nature of LCT\\u2019s business, as well as its healthy balance sheet and cash flow, which gave the company room to manoeuvre when the IPO was downsized. It is understood that Article 238 was not triggered for two key reasons. First, and most crucially, the banks were able to show that the downsized IPO would not materially derail LCT\\u2019s business and its expansion plans. The group convinced regulators that it could still build its Indonesian plant regardless of the smaller IPO. Secondly, the change in size would not adversely affect the voting power of the shareholders. In fact, a smaller issuance increases the voting power of each share.

", "article": " WITH the iconic Petronas Twin Towers looming over Suria KLCC, it is hard to imagine the current challenging retail environment having any impact on the mall. However, the crowded retail market in the Klang Valley might not have spared the upmarket shopping centre. KLCCP Stapled Group \\u2014 which owns and manages office, retail and hotel properties and has a 60% stake in Suria KLCC retail mall \\u2014 has seen declining earnings in the past year. KLCCP Stapled Group comprises KLCC Property Holdings Bhd and KLCC REIT. At RM999.3 million, the group\\u2019s operating profit slipped below RM1 billion in its financial year ended Dec 31, 2016 (FY2016) \\u2014 it achieved an operating profit of RM1.01 billion for the first time in FY2014 \\u2014 on the back of declining results in the office, retail and hotel segments. The average occupancy rate in the retail segment dropped to 96% from 98% in FY2016. Revenue remained stable at RM1.34 billion. The retail segment contributed 35.4% to total revenue compared with 44% for the office segment. Suria KLCC contributed 92% to the retail segment, with the balance coming from the retail podium in Menara 3 Petronas. The downward trend in the occupancy rate appears to be continuing this year as the group\\u2019s latest results for the financial quarter ended March 31, 2017 (1QFY2017) saw the average occupancy rate fall to 95% from 97% in 1QFY2016. If it remains at this level, it would be even lower than the rate of 96% in FY2016. The lower occupancy rate is reflected in its financial results as the retail segment\\u2019s revenue and profit before tax slipped 1.4% and 1.8% to RM121.8 million and RM92.8 million respectively. The group attributed the lower occupancy rate to the transition for retail mixing. It is worth noting that towards the end of the first quarter this year, Melium Group hosted an exclusive shopping event to mark the closing of its two-decade-old luxury multibrand boutique in Suria KLCC, Aseana, as it relocates to Pavilion KL under a new name and brand, M Pavilion. Herm\\u00e8s, a French luxury fashion brand that had a shop in the mall, also closed a while ago. Some retailers told The Edge that rents have been reduced for new tenants. This raises the question as to whether Suria KLCC has lost its shine as one of the country\\u2019s premium malls. In its response to questions from The Edge, KLCCP Stapled Group says the mall sees revisions in its tenancies every year and all revisions have been upwards thus far, while rents for speciality shops have increased annually. \\u201cAs reported in our 1QFY2017 performance, Suria KLCC did report higher rents from new tenants and lease renewals, which was however, offset by the reduced occupancy in transition for retail mixing,\\u201d the group says in an email. In presenting its first-quarter financial performance, the group says new tenants that have opened shop in the mall during that period included Brooks Brothers, Tory Burch, Hyper Gear and Sunglass Hut. With the pressure on the retail segment as well as its office and hotel business, most analysts who cover KLCCP Stapled Group have a \\u201cneutral\\u201d outlook. Bloomberg consensus data shows that 75% of analysts covering the group have a \\u201chold\\u201d call, 16.7% are calling \\u201csell\\u201d and only 8.3% recommend a \\u201cbuy\\u201d. Year to date (as at June 15), the group was one of the underperformers among the 30 constituent companies of the FBM KLCI. It fell 3.7% to RM7.81 during the period compared with the benchmark index that has surged 9%. Compared with the real estate investment trusts on the stock exchange, KLCCP Stapled Group has also underperformed as the portfolio of REITs has gained 3.2% YTD. Despite the underperformance, KLCCP Stapled Group is trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio of 31.49 times. In comparison, Pavilion REIT, which has Pavilion mall in its portfolio, is trading at a PER of 16.88 times while IGB REIT, which manages Mid Valley Megamall and The Gardens, is at 21.96 times. The premium valuation of KLCCP Stapled Group could be because it owns Petronas Twin Towers \\u2014 the world\\u2019s highest twin towers.

It said the olefin produced, on the other hand, would be further processed in LCT's plants to be converted in to polyolefin (end product for sale).

While the offer price of RM1.80 is at a 52% premium to its last-traded price of RM1.18 on May 23 (before trading was suspended following the announcement), it is 34% below the net tangible assets of RM2.73 per share as at March 31, 2017. The announcement of the unconditional takeover came just after Wing Tai Malaysia returned to the black in the third quarter ended March 31, 2017 (3QFY2017). The group recorded a net profit of RM12.3 million in 3QFY2017 from a net loss of RM941,000 in 3QFY2016 on recovery in the retail division. A fund manager with a local asset management company tells The Edge that the offer was decent, considering the level Wing Tai Malaysia was trading at. However, he notes that this would deny investors ownership of the strong brand names Wing Tai has under its umbrella \\u2014 namely Uniqlo, Topshop, Topman and Dorothy Perkins. \\u201cDespite what was reported by the papers on Wing Tai\\u2019s fundamental value, the market has not recognised that in the last two years,\\u201d he says. Nonetheless, he thinks that the offer provides an exit route for investors immediately and for those who are still keen to have a stake in Wing Tai Malaysia, they can buy into Wing Tai Holdings, which is listed on the Singapore stock exchange. Pangolin Investment Management director James Hay says the takeover price is massively undervalued, adding that Wing Tai Malaysia is worth RM1.63 billion or RM3.42 a share (see table). He reckons that Wing Tai Malaysia\\u2019s high-end residential project opposite the Petronas Twin Towers, Le Nouvel, could turn in a profit of RM100 million or 21 sen per share. On this basis, he pegs Wing Tai Malaysia\\u2019s fair value at RM3.63 per share, using a sum-of-parts valuation. Hay also points out that the free float requirement of 25% puts minorities at a disadvantage as they would be forced to accept an unfair offer or end up owning shares in an unlisted vehicle. Bloomberg data shows Pangolin Investment owns about 2% of Wing Tai Malaysia with an average cost of RM1.61; it bought into the company in 2H2014. The Employees Provident Fund (EPF), which first bought into the group in 2015, has a 0.8% stake in Wing Tai Malaysia with an average cost of RM1.17. OCBC Investment Research views the takeover as a positive development for Wing Tai Holdings. It says in a report dated May 24 that the offer price of RM1.80 is reasonable, considering that the net asset value of each Wing Tai Malaysia share is RM2.70. The research house says the offer provides Wing Tai Malaysia\\u2019s minority shareholders the opportunity to exit and realise their investments for cash. \\u201cThe offer will allow Wing Tai Holdings to further explore synergies and integrate their financial and operational resources, which could result in cost savings and improved operational efficiencies,\\u201d it says. Head of research at Etiqa Insurance & Takaful Chris Eng also says the takeover offer seems decent based on the market price. He notes that the market has become more competitive for Uniqlo over the last three years. Loui Low, an analyst with Hong Leong Investment Bank, tells The Edge that the unconditional takeover offers an opportunity for traders to profit from the market. \\u201cWhen the market started trading on Wednesday, it was already limit up. Given that the takeover price is at RM1.80, which is significantly higher than the RM1.18 at the time, it\\u2019s an opportunity for traders to buy in at a lower price before accepting the takeover offer. Of course, it easily hit the ceiling on Wednesday. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s interesting is that despite trading at RM1.78 on Thursday, [the stock is still seeing] a huge buying interest from investors. Wing Tai\\u2019s trading volume in the last one year was only about 101,000 but the volume on Thursday alone was 6.6 million,\\u201d Low says. A Kuala Lumpur-based stockbroker agrees with Low, saying the heavy volume at the RM1.78-to-RM1.79 range indicates that there is an opportunity for the takeover offer price to go higher. \\u201cIt\\u2019s hard to say if the takeover offer price would be revised upwards but the volume has not been seen in the last five years. It could also be that the traders would not mind buying in at this level to make a quick profit when they accept the offer at RM1.80,\\u201d he says. \\u00a0"}, "195": {"date_posted": "31/5/2017", "title": "FBM KLCI up at 11th hour on CIMB, Maybank", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (May 31): The FBM KLCI rose 0.53 point as the index erased losses at the eleventh hour on buying interest in CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd and Petronas Dagangan Bhd shares.

However, the market has moved ahead of earnings for some of the companies, he points out. \\u201cEver since the FBM KLCI breached the 1,770 level, we have not been as bullish about the market and believe that investors should gradually take profit as we expect to see some weakness. Nonetheless, with the results showing positive outlook, it (FBM KLCI) could still head towards the 1,800 level \\u2026 there\\u2019s nothing wrong with the local market and the market sentiment. The concern is more on the global market,\\u201d says Eng. Some of the external factors that he mentions are the investigation into US President Donald Trump\\u2019s ties to Russia, and the geo\\u00adpolitical tension involving North Korea. The stock market appears to have hit a bumpy road as fears of more trouble ahead for the Trump presidency spread across global markets. The FBM KLCI has fallen for three consecutive days up to last Thursday \\u2014 something that has only happened three times this year before the latest decline. A fund manager with a local asset management company, however, brushed off the decline as a temporary blip and insists that stronger earnings will keep the market momentum moving into the second half of 2017. \\u00a0 Construction: 2016 contracts translate into better earnings Jeremy Goh, an analyst with Hong Leong Investment Bank, says the construction sector in general will see strong earnings results for the quarter ended March 31. \\u201cIn general, if you look at the contracts that have been announced on Bursa Malaysia, 2016 saw a record high of RM56.4 billion [domestic contracts awarded to listed contractors] and usually, the impact on profit will come in a year later for a span of three years,\\u201d says Goh. He adds that the momentum for the market rally hinges on the performance of corporate earnings. \\u201cThe stock market will be a bit jittery if earnings disappoint but if it meets expectations, the momentum will continue. Of course, investors would probably still be hopeful if the first-quarter earnings were not on track as they would probably take a wait-and-see approach. But what\\u2019s certain is that the numbers for the first six months will be crucial to keep the momentum going,\\u201d says Goh. Pong concurs but believes that certain companies will perform well in the second half. He highlights Econpile Holdings Bhd as one of the construction companies that is positioned to benefit from the upcoming contracts to be awarded. \\u00a0 Banking: Proxy for economic growth Public Bank Bhd was one of the first few banks to announce its first-quarter results for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2017 (1QFY2017). Net profit rose a marginal 1.5% to RM1.25 billion from RM1.23 billion a year ago. With the Malaysian economy expected to improve moving into next year, the banking sector is likely to see better days ahead, says Etiqa\\u2019s Eng. In the first quarter of this year, the economy grew at its fastest pace in two years as gross domestic product rose 5.6%, according to Bank Negara Malaysia. The banking sector is viewed as a support to economic growth. Thus, the earnings releases of Malayan Banking Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, RHB Bank Bhd and Hong Leong Bank Bhd this week will be closely monitored. The Bursa Malaysia Finance Index has increased 13.6% year to date (up to May 18). \\u00a0 Plantation: Better 1Q but weakness in 2H expected The plantation sector is also expected to see better earnings this week on a year-on-year basis. Alan Lim, an analyst at MIDF Research, says the results could be weaker sequentially but better year on year, in tandem with the movement in crude palm oil prices. Eng says, \\u201cWhile the earnings results are likely to be better in the first quarter as well as the first half, analysts are expecting a weaker second half as a result of weaker CPO prices. On this basis, despite better earnings in the first quarter, most analysts feel that it is in line with expectations.\\u201d The plantation players that will be announcing their results this week include Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd and Sime Darby Bhd. \\u00a0 Oil and gas: Gradual recovery but volatile oil price a key risk An analyst with a local research house says the outlook for the oil and gas sector remains weak and he expects its earnings to remain flattish. \\u201cThe oil price is still volatile while the capital expenditure will take some time to come through. Of course, we have seen a strong rally in some of the O&G counters but it\\u2019s mainly due to a sharp collapse in some of these companies in the last two years. Currently, some of the shares are already back to their fair value and I wouldn\\u2019t advocate chasing after them,\\u201d he says. Petronas Dagangan Bhd is one of the O&G companies that has announced its first-quarter results \\u2014 it saw a 15.4% growth in net profit to RM253.2 million. Most of the O&G companies that announced their results last week saw better earnings than the year before. Raymond Yap, of CIMB Research, says in a report that the 1QFY2017 results for Petronas Dagangan were within expectations but a downward surprise was seen in the decline of sales volume by 4% year on year. \\u00a0 Consumer: Weak consumer sentiment persists After rallying in the last two years, the consumer sector is not looking too bright as sentiment remains weak, according to an analyst from TA Securities. She says a lot of consumer players have had to raise prices due to the rising cost of commodities. With the pressure from rising inflation as well as the weaker ringgit, this has led to weak consumer sentiment. \\u201cEarnings are expected to be weaker or remain flattish compared with the previous year\\u2019s results. [With factors such as] the ringgit remaining low \\u2014 the house view is at RM4.25 against the US dollar \\u2014 and rising price of raw materials such as sugar due to the rationalisation of government subsidies, consumer sentiment is expected to remain weak,\\u201d she explains. However, the analyst says sentiment could improve if an early general election were to translate into more goodies for the public. \\u201cIf that happens, consumer sentiment could improve and this would probably stimulate spending,\\u201d she adds. There are other consumer players that are doing well, such as the poultry players and convenience stores, according to an analyst from a local research house. \\u00a0 Logistics: Long-term growth story Logistics players are not likely to see excitement from their earnings announcements in the coming week, say analysts. \\u201cQuarter on quarter, we think that there will be a slight decline but overall, it should be flattish results for the logistics players. I think that for them, it will be more of a long-term growth story, driven by the e-commerce boom. But in the near term, we\\u2019re not going to see much excitement,\\u201d says Hong Leong Investment Bank analyst Lim Sin Kiat. \\u00a0"}, "198": {"date_posted": "19/5/2017", "title": "FBM KLCI up on crude oil as U.S. shares recover", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (May 19): The FBM KLCI rose 1.11 points or 0.1% as higher crude oil prices led to oil and gas companies' share gains.

But what is next for our corporations and institutions? While it is acknowledged that we have strengthened the foundations of our many organisations, the world races on. If these newfound efficiencies are not rapidly leveraged in our path towards global championship, then the \\u00adpotential for regression in the way we compete and sustain advantage in markets at home and abroad will \\u00adremain high. In a digitally driven and fast-converging global economy, not only consumers but also public audiences determine business reputations and market values where performances reflected in stock prices are sometimes beyond the full control of companies and organisations. In the boardrooms of the branded, it is not just stock movements that are being actively tracked today. Of equal importance is the impact of social media commentary as a parallel barometer on the health of companies, products and services. Given that business agility remains important to corporate success, a critical aspect not yet dominant in our institutional mindset is how to relate business performance with market perception or stock price with consumer sentiment. The solution to strengthening this linkage is brand power \\u2014 the ability to attract, manage and sustain market support better than the competition. Malaysian companies are already strong but when not reinforced with the right foundations, the best of structures can break down. Similarly, the strongest of businesses can quickly lose dominance without the support of loyal markets at home and elsewhere. The crucial next step, which will define our future efforts and legacy as a nation, is not just continuous transformation but the bastion of brand power. To effectively compete on the world stage, we need to build the essential pillars of brand building in form (identity), character (credibility) and delivery (experience). In other words, we cannot create brands only at design, marketing or communications level but elevate brand building to the policy level of the organisation to be championed by boards as a business strategy. If the future of any enterprise depends on the growth and retention of favourable markets, why is stronger brand learning and investment not a board policy to be instituted and monitored for strategic impact? \\u00a0 Brand-aware, not brand-driven The answer to this question is that most of us are brand-aware but not yet brand-driven. As consumers, when we think of a brand, we recall a visual or a jingle: a name, symbol, tune or a combination of all to identify the producer or retailer of a certain product or service. In their tangible forms, brands are recognised through the familiarity of logos, colours, marketing materials and other physical or digital expressions. However, we also know that a brand is more than just a name and a logo. We connect with the brands we support as we like what we see, what we feel and what we remember in our experience with them better than the others. Whether it is a bank, a detergent, a favourite apparel brand, a mobile service provider or the way we choose to transport ourselves, we remain faithful to our chosen brands like timeworn friends through the trust built and the promise of delivery between customer and producer. But what has this brand affinity got to do with the making of Malaysia\\u2019s global champions? And why should companies be more brand-driven? Consider this. If market goodwill drives bottom-line performances through how consumers applaud and differentiate organisations for their products and services, why is the building of brands (which includes the corporate or institutional brand) not embedded in business policy to guide and converge management thinking within current business planning objectives and processes? And why do we not invest enough in what our consumers see, feel and experience in our offerings, especially in markets populated by those with the power to attract and retain market support? Why do we not enhance our competences to confidently enter and grow markets the same way as the branded? \\u00a0 Barriers to better branding In Malaysia, the barriers to better brand building and goodwill management are many: \\u2022\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0Absence of essential brand pillars. As a developing economy, there is a tendency to adopt mature-market knowledge and practices to \\u00adshorten learning curves in everything we do, from strategic planning to production, operations, marketing, distribution and sales. While much of our success has been premised on the production and marketing of goods and services that is comparable to the best in the world, not many have achieved competitiveness through brand power without the convergence of the essential brand pillars \\u2014 board policy, commitment, investment and knowhow; \\u2022\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0Stage of market readiness. In transitioning from production to market orientation, there is an urgent need to evolve developed market practices to one that better suits our stage of market readiness for greater brand success. For example, brand responsibility still resides with product development, marketing or communications, and is not yet conceptualised and designed at strategic levels of the organisation. Products and services are often developed without brand thinking, thereby negating the effectiveness of marketing and promotional support when it is left too late. Finally, brand investments \\u00adbeyond marketing and advertising are seldom adequate to get the product or service \\u201cbrand right\\u201d in the downstream phase of marketing and distribution; and \\u2022\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0Brands as an expense, not strategic assets. Without policy-driven investments to \\u00adensure the evolution of a \\u201cliving brand\\u201d with the potential to become a market winner, measuring the impact of brand investments on business performance is seldom executed. This constraint continues to hamper better brand thinking and commitments at many of our organisations. \\u00a0 Global champions With investment in brand building generally limited to advertising and promotions (A&P), in emerging markets, with the exception of a few in Asia \\u2014 Toyota, Samsung, Sony, Honda, Hyundai, Canon, Nissan, Panasonic, Kia, Huawei and Lenovo \\u2014 not many made it to Interbrand\\u2019s Top 100 as brand-driven global champions last year. In a 2016 regional exploration of consumer \\u00adattitudes, AirAsia (41) was the lone Made in Malaysia brand among Asia\\u2019s Top 100 brands ranked by global information and insight provider, Nielsen. Among Asia\\u2019s Top 1,000 brands in 2016 were Maybank (397), Mister Potato (398), Petronas (409), Spritzer (470), Poh Kong (506), Malaysia Airlines (514), Habib (607), Boh (608), Maxis (636), Firefly (713), Mamee (730), Poslaju (737), CIMB Bank (741), Caring Pharmacy (760), Celcom (871), Bonia (913), DiGi (914), Takaful Malaysia (925) and Mydin (938). The survey with 6,400 respondents from 13 Asian markets (including Australia) and across 14 major categories tracked the most popular brands in Asia from a consumer perspective. The robustness of the Malaysian brand will depend on the brand power of our homegrown champions. Twenty-one brands or 2% of the 1,000 most-favoured Asian brands is a start but if brand equity (the market value a brand potentially generates) is a significant business performance indicator, then more companies need to be empowered with the knowledge and capability. This is not only to retain the goodwill that drove returns on investments in the past but also to confidently compete for market support in the future. The endgame for Malaysia is to champion at least five Made in Malaysia brands into Interbrand\\u2019s Top 100 and target 100 placements on Asia\\u2019s Top 1,000 brands by 2030. Targeting 10 global championships and brand positions over 15 years, South Korea, starting in the late 1990s, continues to run the fastest and most impressive brand race in Asia. With the full commitment of Malaysian boards, CEOs and \\u00adrelated stakeholders, we will be able to \\u00adaccomplish the same, if not more. The sooner we start, the better.

It was the day his flagship company \\u2014 Iskandar Waterfront Holdings Sdn Bhd (IWH) \\u2014 partnered China Railway Engineering Corp (CREC) in inking a RM7.41 billion deal with 1Malaysia Development Bhd to acquire a 60% stake in the 483-acre Bandar Malaysia development in Kuala Lumpur. The RM741 million deposit paid by the consortium proved a boon to 1MDB, which was cash-strapped at the time. \\u201cThe consortium is a highly attractive development partner for Bandar Malaysia and their bid was fully in line with the objectives outlined in the RFP (request for proposal), namely value maximisation, acceptable commercial terms and certainty of transaction execution,\\u201d 1MDB CEO Arul Kanda Kandasamy was quoted in the press as saying at the signing ceremony. He probably breathed a huge sigh of relief as with the sale of the 60% stake in Bandar Malaysia and power assets to China General Nuclear Power Corp, there was cash coming in like rain during a prolonged drought for 1MDB. IWH\\u2019s Lim was probably equally thrilled to secure the opportunity to develop one of last sizeable tracts of land in the city that was only 10km from KL Sentral and the Petronas Twin Towers. Furthermore, Bandar Malaysia is slated to become the city\\u2019s new transport hub with a proposed high-speed rail terminus and MRT station. The estimated gross development value of Bandar Malaysia is in excess of RM150 billion, which would give the KL-born tycoon, most of whose land bank is in Johor, a foothold in the city. Furthermore, he could proudly claim that he had won the land by edging out more than 40 other bidders in an international tender. Down south, Lim\\u2019s property business had been growing slowly but surely. His knack for creating value saw the entry of three large China-based developers \\u2014 Country Garden, R&F Properties and Greenland Holdings Corp Ltd. His developments on reclaimed land in Danga Bay and facing Singapore have been called audacious. Country Garden bought 11ha of waterfront land for RM900 million from IWH in December 2012 and its project \\u2014 Country Garden Danga Bay \\u2014 is the first massive development undertaken by a China-based developer in Malaysia. In less than four years, Country Garden has completed 9,800 residential units with private sandy beaches and recreational facilities. The keys to the homes are to be handed over in July. Like it or not, the tycoon has created demand in China for properties in Johor with the theme that the state is the gateway to Singapore. Back to KL, some quarters believe the signing of the share sale agreement on Bandar Malaysia kick-started Lim\\u2019s lucky streak. Certainly, the past one year has been a bumper year for his other major company, Ekovest Bhd. Once shunned by institutional investors, it became a darling of the market when it struck a deal to dispose of a 40% stake in its wholly-owned subsidiary Konsortium Lebuhraya Utara-Timur (KL) Sdn Bhd (KESTURI) to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) for RM1.13 billion cash. KESTURI is the holding company for the first and second phase of Ekovest\\u2019s Duta Ulu-Kelang Expressway (DUKE). The second phase is expected to be completed in the first half of this year. Lim owns 32.38% of Ekovest, together with Datuk Harris Onn Hussein, who pared down his stake after the stock rallied from 43 sen at end-2015 to a high of RM1.43 in early March this year. Lim is also the company\\u2019s executive chairman. Also last year, Ekovest received approval for the third phase of DUKE. On top of that, the concessionaire secured a RM560 million interest-free advance from the government to support its debt repayments. The advance made Ekovest\\u2019s issue of sukuk worth RM3.64 billion much easier. In short, the government is helping Ekovest load the interest cost of the highway from the first eight years of the concession to the subsequent 15 years under a reimbursable interest assistance scheme. Boosted by the strong tailwind, Lim unveiled the proposed merger of listed entity Iskandar Waterfront City Bhd and IWH. The plan was well received by investors as IWC soared to a record high of RM3.22 on May 2 \\u2014 the day before news of the termination of the stake sale in Bandar Malaysia broke. The abrupt end of the deal has certainly dealt the tycoon a big blow. And for that reason, albeit a wrong one, he is likely to remain in the spotlight for some time to come. \\u00a0"}, "202": {"date_posted": "16/5/2017", "title": "KLCI flat after falling on IHH", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (May 16): The FBM KLCI fell 0.5 point to 1,778.15 points after the index cut losses in the final trading minutes on late buying of Petronas Dagangan Bhd shares.

On May 4, UMW-OG proposed to raise up to RM1.81 billion via a rights issue of up to 6.05 billion new shares together with up to 1.51 billion free warrants at an issue price of 30 sen per rights share.

Hong Leong Investment Bank analyst Lim Sin Kiat concurred, noting other key concerns dragging the share price down. \\u201cSecuring more contracts is good, but there is a share price overhang with the rights issue,\\u201d said Lim, adding that the counter may also face a one-off selldown after UMW Holdings completes the distribution of its stake in UMW-OG to its shareholders. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think they (the shareholders) will hold [the stock].\\u201d Lim, however, opined that the rights issue is the best way for UMW-OG to source its fund right now, lest risking a jump in gearing. \\u201cIt is very tough, as you cannot take in more debt.

The only other way is by equity funding or rights issue. \\u201cOr unless its major shareholder agrees to the issuance of preferred stock, which is what they are doing now,\\u201d Lim said.

We note that UMW-OG\\u2019s share price has risen by 12% since our recommendation upgrade last week. UMW-OG has sold a 50% stake in its semi-submersible rig Naga 1 to Panama-incorporated JDC Panama Inc for US$1.7 million (RM7 million) cash via an open tender. It retains the remaining half. Naga 1, which has a Mitsubishi MD 25-SP propulsion and rated to operate at water depths of 1,000ft (305m), was acquired by the UMW group in 2005. The rig had a 14-year charter with Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd until August 2018. However, the contract was discontinued last year due to an absence of requirements for this rig class and age. Idle since the third quarter of financial year 2016, we are \\u201cneutral\\u201d on the group\\u2019s decision to dispose of Naga 1 to reduce its maintenance costs and operating capital expenditure.

However, based on Naga 1\\u2019s original investment of US$17 million, we estimate a net book value of US$7 million assuming a straight-line depreciation over 20 years. As the group may have made some provisions for the diminution in value of its rig assets last year, we do not expect UMW-OG to register any significant losses from this sale. As the rig itself is not operational currently and hence would not result in additional minority charges from the sale, we expect a marginal reduction in UMW-OG\\u2019s interest costs. With a fleet utilisation that can only reach 50% at best with significantly lower new charter rates, the group\\u2019s losses and negative cash flow are unlikely to abate in the medium term. Hence, the stock currently trades at 35% of its latest book value of RM1.04 per share, which could be eroded by further losses and asset impairments. Nevertheless, we are \\u201cpositive\\u201d on the possibility that UMW-OG\\u2019s proposed RM1.8 billion rights issue with detachable rights may be cut by 60% to RM700 million if the merger is aborted, which will have a significantly lower dilution to shareholders. \\u2014 AmInvestment Bank, May 2"}, "211": {"date_posted": "28/4/2017", "title": "Strong earnings visibility for Yinson", "article": " Yinson Holdings Bhd\n(April 27, RM3.28)\nMaintain buy with a higher fair value (FV) of RM3.90: We maintain a \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Yinson Holdings Bhd with a higher sum-of-parts (SoP)-based FV of RM3.90 per share (from an earlier RM3.83 per share), which implies a financial year 2018 (FY18) price-earnings ratio of 20 times.

As CMMT\\u2019s DPU is paid out on a half-yearly basis, unitholders can expect to receive their 1QFY17 DPU, together with the 2QFY17 DPU, by August 2017. The largest drag on its 1QFY17 income came from Sungei Wang Plaza, which registered a 38.2% fall in NPI to RM4.8 million from RM7.76 million a year ago, as the mall continues to be temporarily affected by the ongoing Mass Rapid Transit works and the closure of BB Plaza. The trust\\u2019s revenue fell 1.28% to RM92.44 million in 1QFY17 from RM93.64 million a year ago. Property developer Yong Tai Bhd said today it is considering disposing of its ailing textile and garment business in the near future. This is in line with the company's plans to diversify its core business to tourism and cultural-related property development, it added. However, Yong Tai noted it has not entered into any formal negotiation or agreement with any third party recently to dispose of the loss-making textile and garment business held by its wholly-owned subsidiary Syarikat Koon Fuat Industries Sdn Bhd. It was responding to an article entitled 'Yong Tai expects to exit garment business by June' in The Edge Financial Daily yesterday, which stated the company was in talks with the previous owner of Syarikat Koon Fuat Industries to dispose of the unit. China-based fabric manufacturer Sinotop Holdings Bhd wants to dispose of an indirect 35.625% equity stake in Suzhou Xuande Zhifu Yihe Investment Management Co Ltd Equity Investment Centre (Limited Partnership) (Xuande) at cost, as the investment failed to provide returns.

JKG Land Bhd\\u2019s rights issue has been oversubscribed by 27.1% or 410.99 million shares after it received valid acceptances and excess applications of 1.93 billion rights shares. The group had made available 1.52 billion rights shares for the exercise, on the basis of two rights shares for one existing share held (2-for-1). The property developer had fixed the rights issue price at 10 sen apiece which would see it raise as much as RM151.7 million from the exercise. The cash call was to raise funds for its property development projects, expansion plans, and working capital, as well as to repay its short-term bank borrowings. Anzo Holdings Bhd has responded to the latest unusual market activity (UMA) query posed by Bursa Malaysia, stating that the group is not aware of any corporate development that would have caused it. Yesterday, Anzo was slapped with the UMA query, after its share price plunged by 19.5 sen or 35.14% to 36 sen. This is the second UMA query received by the construction and timber product manufacturing group within a month; it was queried on March 28 after the share price jumped to 54.5 sen the previous day from 29 sen on March 13. In its reply today, Anzo said that after making enquiries with the directors, major shareholders and any other relevant persons, it is not aware of any corporate development, rumour or report concerning its business and affairs that may have accounted for the UMA.

Landmarks Bhd is proposing a private placement to raise as much as RM36.93 million to revitalise and grow its business through the injection of fresh equity into the group, with an indicative issue price of 76 sen per placement share. The group said the indicative price represents a discount of 9.5% to the five-day volume weighted average price of Landmarks' share price of up to and including the latest practicable date (LPD) of 84 sen. The placement involves issuing up to 48.59 million new shares, representing up to 10% of the group's enlarged issued share capital, to third-party investors to be identified later. The group said it is expected to raise gross proceeds of RM36.54 million under the minimum scenario and RM36.93 million under the maximum scenario upon completion of the proposed private placement. Under the maximum scenario, RM13 million will be used to repay a term loan obtained from Malayan Banking Bhd, RM11.6 million for capital expenditure as part of the development of the 338-hectare Treasure Bay Bintan waterfront resort city in Bintan, Indonesia, RM11.46 million for working capital and the remaining RM870,000 to defray expenses in relation to the exercise.

Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd (MPI) posted an 11% rise in net profit for its third quarter ended March 31, 2017 (3QFY17) to RM43.21 million, from RM38.99 million a year earlier, due mainly to favourable exchange difference and lower operating costs.\n\\u00a0\nRevenue for the quarter gained 12% to RM396 million, from RM352.12 million previously, said the Hong Leong Group member company in its stock exchange filing today.

However, TA Securities maintained its \"sell\" rating with a target price of 96 sen as it sees the company's near-term earnings weakness persisting, underpinned by low yard utilisation. MHB has secured a new RM1 billion contract from Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd, which involves engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning works for the central processing platform (CPP) at Bokor Phase 3 Re-Development Project, the research house said. First steel cut is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2018 (3Q18), and the project is targeted for completion in mid-2Q20, the research house added. \"Assuming a net margin of 4%, this new contract could potentially contribute profit of RM6 million/RM18 million in FY18/FY19,\" said TA securities, adding that inclusive of this new project win, it estimates that the group has an outstanding orderbook of RM1.6 billion. \"On the flipside, we are disappointed by the late commencement date of this new project (1st steel cut: 3Q18). Therefore, we deem this contract as part of FY18 orderbook replenishment,\" said TA Securities, adding that profit recognition will likely to start from FY19. With the new contract win, TA Securities tweaked its FY18 assumption higher to RM1.5 billion, which raised FY18/FY19 core profit forecast to RM24 million/RM48 million from the previous RM18 million/RM30 million. Meanwhile, AmInvestment Bank maintained its \"hold\" recommendation on MHB with an unchanged fair value of RM1 based on a 40% discount to FY17 book valuation. \"The stock currently trades at a P/BV (price-to-book value) of 0.6x due to the likelihood of further operating losses from the upstream sector's slow project rollouts,\" said AmInvestment Bank. AmInvestment Bank noted that even with higher yard utilisation in 4QFY16, MHB's 4QFY16 revenue declined 9% quarter-on-quarter, which resulted in a core loss of RM40 million, including additional one-off margins from marine change orders. Hence, the group's earnings momentum is unlikely to gain traction this year, said AmInvestment Bank. \"[The] management acknowledged the slow rollout of upstream jobs, as scheduled awards have been postponed due to the uncertain oil price trajectory,\" said AmInvestment Bank. \"This Bokor project is much needed for MHB's West yard as its current yard utilisation of 50% to 60% could drop to a relatively idle capacity with the completion of the Baronia CPP and F12 Kumang topside by 1HFY17,\" added AmInvestment Bank. AmInvestment Bank said only the covered workshops in the West and East yards will be busy with the five packages worth RM246 million from Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development.

Scomi Group Bhd has inked a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) to develop a 30MWac large-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) power plant in Bandar Sungai Petani, Kedah, on a build-own-operate basis. Construction of the power plant will be undertaken by Scomi's 30%-owned special purpose vehicle Strong Elegance Sdn Bhd. The remaining equity interest in Strong Elegance is held by Synergy Generated Sdn Bhd (40%) and Lembaga Tabung Angkata Tentera (30%). \"The PPA, which has an expected commercial operation date of Dec 31, 2018, governs the sale and purchase obligations of the energy generated by the project between Strong Elegance and TNB for a period of 21 years from the commercial operation date in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions,\" Scomi said. Top Glove Corp Bhd's wholly-owned unit Top Glove Sdn Bhd (TGSB) has embarked on a joint venture (JV) with Japanese firm Fimatec Ltd, to venture into the manufacturing of rubber reinforcing agent. \"The JV is a long-term investment plan for Top Glove group of companies. It aims to reduce the overall glove production cost, improve glove quality and production efficiency through the supply of good and consistent quality of rubber reinforcing agent,\" said Top Glove. The business will be carried out via Techniglove Asia Sdn Bhd as the JV company, which will be renamed TG FMT Sdn Bhd and commence operations by the first quarter of 2018. The agreement states that TGSB will subscribe for up to RM4.2 million of Techniglove's paid-up capital, and Fimatec will subscribe for up to RM1.8 million. Both parties' subscriptions will be executed in stages. \"In any event of any increase of the share capital of the proposed JV company, the enlarged share capital of the proposed JV company would be 70% by TGSB and 30% by Fimatec,\" said Top Glove. BCB Bhd is acquiring six adjoining plots of agriculture land, measuring a combined 18.91 hectares, in Batu Pahat, Johor, for RM34.6 million, on which it will develop a residential project with an estimated gross development value of RM360 million.

The purchase will be funded via a combination of internal funds and borrowings. \"It is too preliminary at this stage to ascertain the total development cost and expected profits to be derived from the proposed development,\" said the group. \\u00a0"}, "225": {"date_posted": "20/3/2017", "title": "Crude oil price a wildcard in local stock market", "article": " \\u00a0 KUALA LUMPUR: The local bourse started the year on a rather positive note, in line with a positive global growth story and anticipation of better corporate earnings, driven by recovery in commodity prices. It is no wonder the FBM KLCI has gained some upward momentum, up 6.3% year to date (YTD) to 1,745.20 points while the broader market FBM Emas Index has climbed 7.63% YTD to 12,341.34. But the renewed pressure on the crude oil prices is raising concerns about whether the positive sentiment would be sustainable. Pong Teng Siew, head of research with Inter-Pacific Securities Sdn Bhd, cautioned that the recovery in American drilling for oil could drive crude oil prices lower and change the expectation on earnings growth moving forward. According to him, earnings outlook has been better at the moment against the backdrop of higher and stabilise crude oil and palm oil prices. He, however, was not convinced that the oil prices would stay at the current level. A reversal could change expectations about earnings growth. \\u201cI think there is a danger that the market is pricing in a lot of positive factors despite the uncertainties that remain. I have my doubt if the oil will be as bullish as some people are expecting. There\\u2019s a strong production pickup in the oil market especially in the US. Unless demand picks up strongly, it will be difficult for the momentum of the oil price to continue,\\u201d Pong commented. He added that global growth has also relied heavily on China in the past few years and that the market has yet to make sense of what China\\u2019s economy might look like over the next few years. He shared that while growth in the US could pick up, the shale oil production has also expanded rapidly, \\u00a0a counterweight to the effect from stronger demand in the US. Under these circumstances, Pong shared that the market will eventually have to be realistic about the oil price movement. \\u201cThe domino effect from a weakened oil price could hurt other commodities and sectors in the country. The oil and gas players have seen a strong rally since the beginning of the year and if the oil price were to weaken, the sentiment would reverse,\\u201d he said. A technical chartist shared with The Edge Financial Daily that the FBM KLCI has a strong correlation with the oil price movement, with the benchmark index lagged behind the oil price movement. \\u201cIf you look at the collapse of the oil price back in 2014, the index has tracked the movement of the oil. Similarly, when the oil staged a gradual recovery in 2016, the FBM KLCI tried to emulate that. \\u201cThe equity market was affected by other news flow and development but oil has been the main factor in the last two to three years,\\u201d he said and pointed out that the index is likely to be affected by the movement of the oil price in the next few weeks. \\u201cThe sentiment would swing if oil price remains low or shows a declining trend. At the moment, it doesn\\u2019t look that way,\\u201d he added. MIDF Amanah Investment Bank Bhd deputy head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman said that oil price is also one of the determinant of the movement of the equity market but he was more positive about its outlook. He shared that positive corporate news flow such as stabilising crude oil (Brent is now hovering around US$51 [RM225.93] per barrel), which is positive for downstream O&G players such as Petronas Chemicals and Petronas Dagangan. Other factors that have lent support to the local bourse include expectations of better earnings performance this year as well as a lower geopolitical risk impact from Europe and the US. Mohd Redza expects better market sentiment ahead with higher earnings expectations, coupled with favourable operating climate. He, however, cautioned that there could be some shocks from upcoming elections in Europe as well as the movement of oil prices as the Opec agreement on production cut is only valid until the middle of the year."}, "226": {"date_posted": "17/3/2017", "title": "Weekend by numbers: 17.03.17 to 19.03.17", "article": " 3 unusual ways to indulge in the arts Organise a get-together with family and friends or simply mingle with other like-minded individuals at the Dancing in Place session organised by Rimbun Dahan and MyDance Alliance.

On March 10, UMW-OG was awarded a jack-up drilling rig services contract by Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd\\u2019s subsidiary Vestigo Petroleum Sdn Bhd to drill one well. Four days later, the company received a similar contract from British oilfield company Petrofac Ltd for two wells. UMW-OG\\u2019s shares rose \\u00a03.17% to 65 sen yesterday on news of the second drilling contract, but the gain is hardly significant considering that the stock was at the 70 sen level after the announcement of the company\\u2019s demerger from UMW Holdings Bhd on Jan 19. The stock in fact has been lingering between 63 sen and 65 sen since Feb 28. UMW-OG did not disclose the value of both charter contracts, which are set to commission this year, but said that the contracts should contribute to its book in the current financial year ending Dec 31, 2017 (FY17). This adds to its existing contract value worth RM833 million, and lower depreciation following major impairments done in the fourth quarter of FY16. Analysts, however, have opined that contribution from the two contracts \\u2014 being spot contracts averaging 30 days per well \\u2014 will not be significant. \\u201cIt is positive, but the contract is small in value, and they are only there for very short term. I think it will only marginally impact its share price,\\u201d an analyst told The Edge Financial Daily. For many, concerns remain about UMW-OG\\u2019s restructuring plan which involves the demerger from UMW Holdings and the acquisition of Icon Offshore Sdn Bhd and Orkim Sdn Bhd. A week after the Jan 19 announcement, UMW-OG\\u2019s share price dived 23.6% from 89 sen in just a week before hitting an all-time low of 63 sen on Tuesday. According to analysts, the acquisition plan is burdened with pricey valuation of the two companies. Even less attractive is the rights issue at 50 sen per UMW-OG share to raise up to RM1.8 billion, which will be used mainly for the acquisition. AmInvestment Bank said the acquisition is \\u201cvalue-destructive\\u201d for UMW-OG, with the unjustified price-to-book value of Icon and Orkim at 0.7 times and 3.6 times respectively. \\u201cWithout these acquisitions, we estimate that the merged entity\\u2019s much-needed recapitalisation plan could have been cut by 60%,\\u201d it said. TA Securities opines there is another side to the merger. \\u201cUMW-OG\\u2019s cash flow difficulties will be alleviated by Icon and Orkim. Furthermore, after the rights issue, the merged entity\\u2019s net gearing will reduce to 0.91 times from 1.69 times currently,\\u201d it said in a note. Overall, restructuring will be good for the company and industry in the long run, but another bigger issue looms for the jack-up rig service provider \\u2014 oversupply. \\u201cThe mergers will make our industry players stronger and more competitive,\\u201d the analyst said. \\u201cBut the main concern is jobs. If there is no job in the jack-up rig charter market, it will not help,\\u201d he added."}, "228": {"date_posted": "14/3/2017", "title": "Malaysia's Petchem JV search continues after Saudis join hub", "article": " (March 14): Petronas Chemicals Bhd, a unit of Malaysia\\u2019s state energy company, said it\\u2019s in talks with petrochemical firms from Asia and Europe to invest in a US$27 billion oil refining and petrochemical project, sustaining hope the country can find a partner after at least three previous deals fell through. Companies from Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan and Italy have expressed interest in joining the Refinery and Petrochemicals Integrated Development or RAPID, said Chief Executive Officer Sazali Hamzah, declining to identify them. Earlier plans by Petronas Chemicals\\u2019 parent, Petroliam Nasional Bhd, to develop petrochemical plants at the complex in the southern state of Johor with Evonik Industries AG, BASF SE and Kuokuang Petrochemical Technology Co never materialized. RAPID, announced in 2011 and originally scheduled to start last year, got a boost last month when Saudi Arabian Oil Co, the world\\u2019s biggest oil exporter, said it will invest US$7 billion. Talks that led to the deal with the world\\u2019s biggest oil exporter, known as Saudi Aramco, started in at least 2014, Sazali said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s really a tough time to find investors, especially in oil and gas because of the uncertainties of the oil situation,\\u201d Sazali said Monday in Kuala Lumpur. \\u201cIf everyone\\u2019s agendas can be aligned, then it will happen.\\u201d As RAPID\\u2019s development accelerates, Petronas Chemicals plans to increase capital spending by as much as one-quarter this year and next from last year\\u2019s roughly 4 billion ringgit (US$900 million), Sazali said. The company used an oil price assumption of US$50 to US$60 a barrel, when it budgeted for the project in 2015, as part of its \\u201cnew normal,\\u201d he said. 2020 Target Brent crude, the global benchmark, has averaged about US$55 this year, down from almost US$100 in 2014. Shares of Petronas Chemicals have risen 4.9% this year, matching the gain in the benchmark stock index. The increased spending will help raise production capacity of basic chemicals to 16 million tons a year by 2020, from 10.8 million tons now, with most of that coming from RAPID, Sazali said. \"RAPID provides full integration of infrastructure and support facilities\" and also sizeable land for future expansion, Sazali said. Subsequent investments beyond the current RAPID project would enjoy freight savings and that\\u2019s one reason Rapid could appeal to and attract potential investors, he said. The company also wants to expand further into derivative and specialty chemicals and is evaluating the production of ethylene, propylene and butadiene derivatives, he said. RAPID will remain its focus over the next few years and the company will only actively seek overseas acquisitions next decade, Sazali said. The company is targeting a utilization rate of as high as 90% for its plants this year, he said. Pre-tax profits last year would have been about 20% lower, if it hadn\\u2019t pushed rates to a record 96%, according to Sazali."}, "229": {"date_posted": "14/3/2017", "title": "UMWOG losses unlikely to abate in the near term", "article": " \\u00a0 UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd\n(March 13, 63.5 sen)Maintain hold call with an unchanged fair value (FV) of 65 sen: We maintain our \\u201chold\\u201d call on UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd (UMWOG), with an unchanged FV of 65 sen, based on book value at a 20% discount to cost of the group\\u2019s rigs, together with a 30% reduction in acquisition costs of Icon Offshore Bhd and Orkim Sdn Bhd. Our financial year 2017 (FY17) to FY19 earnings forecasts are also unchanged as the new short-term charter for the Naga 2 jack-up drilling rig from Petronas\\u2019 Vestigo Petroleum remains well within our utilisation assumption of 40% to 60%. As the charter is to drill only one firm well, commencing at the end of the first quarter (1Q) of calendar year 2017, we expect the duration to be around one month. \\u00a0 Recall that UMWOG had earlier secured a short-term charter for a minimum of 50 days for its Naga 2 jack-up rig, starting in 2Q17, for the marginal Ophir Field, Terengganu, in which the joint venture partners are Australiabased Octanex (50%), Scomi (30%) and Vestigo Petroleum (20%). Hence, Naga 2\\u2019s work schedule appears to have accelerated by a month. \\u00a0 Late last year, the group managed to secure an 18-month charter for its Naga 8 jack-up rig from Hess Exploration and Production Malaysia BV to operate in the North Malay Basin, off Peninsular Malaysia. This contract, which has already commenced, is attached with an option to extend for a further 12 months. \\u00a0 At this stage, we understand that the other operating rig is Naga 6, which is chartered to Petronas Carigali for two years, with an extension option for another year, while the other six rigs (including Naga 1) in the fleet are warm-stacked. \\u00a0 As a result, there will only be two rigs in operation in 1QFY17 \\u2014 Naga 6 and Naga 8 \\u2014 while Naga 2 will be temporarily added on charter in 2QFY17. With a fleet utilisation rate that can only reach 38% at best and impacted by significantly lower new charter rates, the group\\u2019s losses and negative cash flow are unlikely to abate in the near term unless there is a significant reversal in the regional rig utilisation rate, which is currently below 40%. We maintain our view that the recently proposed acquisition (together with the demerger from UMW Holdings Bhd) of Icon Offshore and Orkim at unjustified prices by volume of 0.7 times and 3.6 times is value-destructive for UMWOG, against the backdrop of an offshore sector still struggling with operating losses. \\u00a0 Without these acquisitions, we estimate that the merged entity\\u2019s much-needed recapitalisation plan (via an RM1.8 billion renounceable rights issue at 50 sen per share, with a free detachable seven-year warrant) could have been cut by 60%. Hence, the stock currently trades at 38% of its latest book value of RM1.04 per share, which could still be eroded by further losses. \\u2014 AmInvestment Bank, March 13"}, "230": {"date_posted": "6/3/2017", "title": "Petra Energy strikes optimistic note despite losses ", "article": " \\u00a0 AFTER a challenging 2016, Petra \\u00adEnergy Bhd may be a counter to follow closely this year as sentiment in the sector improves. Analysts believe that the work orders from its RM2.5 billion Pan Malaysia contract from Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd look set to boost its performance as crude oil prices rebound. Affin Hwang Capital Research says in a \\u00adreport that it is expecting better margins from its \\u201cbread-and-butter\\u201d business \\u2014 the service and marine asset segment \\u2014as activities pick up. Besides, some say Petra Energy could also be a potential beneficiary of the maintenance, construction and modification (MCM) contract from Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas), which is expected to be awarded by the second \\u00adquarter of this year. Petronas\\u2019 five-year MCM contracts, \\u00adestimated at RM5 billion to RM6 billion, will be split into six packages, says Kenanga Research in a \\u00adreport. The research house adds that the Sarawak MCM portion is the largest \\u2014 at RM1.5 billion. It should not come as a surprise if Petra Energy bags a slice of the MCM contract, given that the company has strong political ties at both the federal and state levels. Its largest shareholder is Sarawakian tycoon Tan Sri Bustari Yusof, who holds a 27.5% stake through Shorefield Resources Sdn Bhd. Datuk Mohamed Nizam Razak, brother of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, has 9.1%. Petra Energy is also said to be looking out for more risk service contracts (RSC) after its success in a joint venture with Coastal Energy Company operating the Kapal, Beranang and Meranti (KBM) cluster fields under the RSC. The KBM cluster is estimated to contain \\u00adrecoverable resources of 15 million to 35 million barrels of oil. Coastal Energy is an international exploration and production company with principal assets in Thailand and Malaysia. Now, with crude oil prices rebounding and the ringgit remaining weak against the greenback, Petra Energy stands to gain more from its KBM RSC, which has helped the company stay cash flow positive. Crude oil prices have rebounded from US$34 to US$56 per barrel within a year. Meanwhile, the ringgit has depreciated 5.2% to 4.44 over the same period. According to Public Investment Research, \\u00adPetra Energy and its partner have been fine-tuning the management of its oil well, which resulted in some reduction in its production cost. It adds that the joint venture plans to drill more wells to enhance production, going forward. For the financial year ended Dec 31, 2016, Petra Energy slipped into the red, recording a net loss of RM117. 28 million compared with net profit of RM47.21 million a year ago. Revenue halved to RM333.24 million from RM654.78 million a year ago as fewer work orders were carried out for the hook up, commissioning and top-side major maintenance contract from Petronas Carigali. A large part of the net loss was attributed to the huge amount of impairments, totalling RM77.38 million, made during the financial year. According to Public Investment Research, Petra Energy impaired two vessels and receivables, which accounted for 65% of the loss. While the results look unimpressive, the company\\u2019s balance sheet remains intact. Unlike many of its peers, Petra Energy is in a net cash position. It also declared a single-tiered \\u00adinterim dividend of two sen per share, bringing its total dividends per share to five sen for FY2016. \\u201cThere is more optimism over the prospects for the oil and gas industry in light of the moderate oil price recovery, although market sentiments are still cautious. The group will \\u00adcontinue to manage costs and increase efficiency. In addition, exploring opportunities in the energy sector shall remain a priority for the group,\\u201d Petra Energy says in a filing last Thursday. Public Investment Research opines that Petra Energy is ready to undertake new jobs or to step up on existing ones, where necessary.

Public Investment Research, which has a \\u201chold\\u201d call on the stock, sees Petra Energy \\u00adperforming better in FY2017. \\u201cWe do anticipate a better performance this year, with Petronas having recalibrated its budget to continue its capital expenditure programme, although at a slower pace. To date, Petra Energy has managed to secure more work orders for its Pan Malaysian contracts compared with 2016, which will improve the group\\u2019s performance, going forward,\\u201d it says. \\u00a0 \\u00a0"}, "231": {"date_posted": "6/3/2017", "title": "Multiple Petronas contracts for SapuraKencana", "article": " \\u00a0 SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd\n(March 3, RM1.97)\nMaintain hold call with a target price (TP) of RM1.80: SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd announced that it has been awarded contracts worth a total value of US$97.4 million (RM433.6 million). The awards consist of: i) Pan Malaysia Integrated Offshore Transportation and Installation (T&I) work; ii) the engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC) job for the Sepat mobile offshore production unit (stabilisation and repair works); iii) Polycold Compact Cooler for the air cooler module; and iv) the petroleum clean-up participation programme for Dana and D30 facilities decommissioning project. All of the above jobs were awarded by Petronas. This is still within our order book replenishment assumption for the company. To note, we have imputed RM3 billion replenishment into the group\\u2019s order book, of which RM2 billion has been achieved. Overall margins of these contracts are expected at about 8% to 11%, consistent with its recent reported margins. While relatively small compared with its previous win (RM1.5 billion) announcement in January 2017, it is still positive news to the company and reduces our concern about the company\\u2019s order book replenishment risk. The order book of the company is about RM17.2 billion based on back-of-the-envelope calculations, similar to the level as per announced in the third financial quarter ended Oct 31, 2016 (3QFY17). We expect more contract flows to come in for the group on the expectation of more stable oil prices in 2017. While T&I have seen higher activities, the EPCC division is still slow with only smallish jobs being dished out. We believe this will persist throughout most of 2017 and bigger EPCC jobs would only be seen towards late 2017. Risks include execution risk and prolonged low oil prices. We maintain our forecast with a \\u201chold\\u201d call, as we are turning more positive on the stock premised on a firmer oil price outlook for 2017. However, the recovery has already been priced in and we believe only the materialisation of a major capital expenditure cycle by oil producers would further catalyse the stock. Our TP is maintained at RM1.80 based on an unchanged FY18 price-to-book value of 0.8 times. \\u2014 Hong Leong Investment Bank Research, March 3"}, "232": {"date_posted": "3/3/2017", "title": "SapuraKencana may report 4QFY17 loss, says AmInvestment Bank", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (March 3): AmInvestment Bank Bhd has cautioned that SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd could report a loss when it announces its 4QFY17 corporate earnings later this morning. In a note today, the research house drew parallels with the impairments provided by Bumi Armada Bhd and UMW Oil & gas Corp Bhd, together with the lower asset utilisation during the year-end monsoon season. \"Recall that the group registered a 9MFY17 net profit of RM381 million versus consensus' FY17 earnings of RM250 million and management's guidance of RM100 million-RM200 million, which implies a 4QFY17 loss of RM131 million,\" it said.

Managing director Daniel Aik (pic) said the group\\u2019s growth for the year ending Dec 31, 2017 (FY17) will be partly driven by the expected pickup in the palm oil industry in Indonesia after a slight slowdown in FY16. \\u201cIndonesia is a sunrise market for us, especially when you talk about the palm oil-based business. We intend to expand our product offering in Indonesia within the year,\\u201d he said in an interview with The Edge Financial Daily. Daniel pointed out that the group in January signed an agreement with Chun Khong Engineering Works Sdn Bhd for the acquisition of a pump factory in Ipoh, which currently caters mainly to the Malaysian palm oil mill market. Currently, Dancomech already supplies valves to its palm oil-based clients in Indonesia and plans to begin supplying pumps sometime within 2017. \\u201cThis would provide additional revenue for the company, and we will be selling the pumps to the same customer base as our valves, so we don\\u2019t need to incur extra costs in terms of human resources. \\u201cWe anticipate sales from Indonesia will increase this year, now that the palm oil sector is picking up in line with the better crude palm oil (CPO) price at the moment. We anticipate a revenue growth of 5% to 10% at least for Indonesia this year,\\u201d Daniel said. He added that Dancomech is considering setting up a distribution office in Indonesia in the future, if the prospects are good. Meanwhile, for the Malaysian market, Dancomech executive director Johnson Aik said the group will push through with its plans to set up distribution offices in Johor as well as in East Malaysia, in Bintulu and Miri. \\u201cWe will set up not only offices but we will also keep some stock there to provide better service to our customers, as in faster delivery and easier engagement with potential clients,\\u201d he said. Johnson added that setting up the offices will also translate into cost savings, as the group would be using sea freight to transport its inventory to the offices, rather than airfreighting its products straight to the end-consumer, which is more expensive. He said that the potential for Bintulu is great as the district has the largest palm oil refinery capacity in Malaysia, while an office in Johor provides the group proximity to Petronas\\u2019 Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (Rapid) in Pengerang. Johnson said the group is also eyeing to secure some ad hoc work at Rapid. \\u201cWith our expansion plans for the year, we expect to register [a] growth of about 15% this year,\\u201d he said. For FY16, the group reported a 16% increase in net profit to RM12.85 million or 9.5 sen per share, from RM10.99 million a year earlier. However, revenue fell 12% year-on-year to RM60 million, partly due to lower contribution from Indonesia. \\u201cThat was due to slower activity in the Indonesian palm oil industry, as there was a bit of an oversupply situation. The low CPO price last year was also a factor. But we expect activity to pick up this year,\\u201d explained Johnson. Currently, Dancomech supplies valves to a number of industries, including palm oil, oil and gas (O&G), water as well as rubber glove factories. The largest contributors are the palm oil-based industries and O&G, contributing about 60% and 25% of the group\\u2019s revenue per year.

Don\\u2019t be deterred by the freight elevator-like entrance; once the door opens, you\\u2019ll be transported into the perfect date night in a softly lit dining room with lots of nooks and crannies. The tasting-menu-only evening starts with a complimentary cocktail (currently a warm apple cider with barley shochu) and progresses through 16-odd courses like capellini with truffles, squab with wild blueberries, and Santa Barbara sea urchin.\\u00a0 Before dinner, if it\\u2019s a weekday \\u2026 enjoy some aperitifs at Cindy\\u2019s Rooftop at the Chicago Athletic Association Hotel, a Venetian Gothic landmark from the 1890s which recently underwent a classy, ultra-slick renovation.

Chef Danielle Alvarez, formerly of Chez Panisse, centres her French country cuisine on seasonal produce and old-world techniques. A special Valentine\\u2019s Day menu features rose veal, blood plum, Clair de lune oysters, saffron tagliatelle and wood-oven snapper.

Before dinner, if it\\u2019s a weekday \\u2026 embrace the balmy summer eves with a wander around the gardens of the century-old Strickland House in the eastern suburb of Vaucluse.\\u00a0 Afterwards, lounge on quiet Milk Beach, a small, secret inlet nearby, and watch the sun decline over the horizon. The view of central Sydney across the water is nothing if not romantic. After brunch, if it\\u2019s a weekend \\u2026 pre-order the perfect picnic from Pop-up Picnic and set a late-afternoon delivery time for Bondi Beach. You\\u2019ll be whiling away the afternoon at Bondi Icebergs Club, with laps in the azure pools, a sit in the sauna and a therapeutic massage. The famous health club has been a fixture at the south end of Bondi Beach for more than 100 years. After grabbing a glass of white on the deck, go find your patch of sand for your sunset sandwiches. \\u00a0 Kuala Lumpur Book a table at \\u2026 Cantaloupe Sky Dining, on the 24th floor of the Foster + Partners-designed Troika building. A tasting menu consists of 24 dishes by Chef Christian Bauer, ranging from geoduck carpaccio, roasted beef marrow, and a sweet-and-savoury combination of yuzu watermelon and miso. But it\\u2019s really the interiors, by Melbourne designer Hecker Guthrie, that accentuate the restaurant\\u2019s \\u00fcber-romantic views over KLCC Park and the Petronas Twin Towers. After dinner, if it\\u2019s a weekday \\u2026 stop over at live jazz bar No Black Tie for music and drinks. The club, a favourite among KL-ites, is just a five-minute cab ride from the restaurant and shows can range from more traditional acts, such as drummer extraordinaire John Thomas, to more pop-friendly shows that pay tribute to David Bowie and Justin Timberlake. For Valentine\\u2019s Day proper, the bill features local pianist-violinist duo A9 Strings. Before dinner, if it\\u2019s a weekend \\u2026 sign up for a two-hour cooking class at the newly opened ABC Cooking Studio for a hands-on lesson on making food the Japanese way. Classes are small, limited to four students for every instructor, and you can choose to make anything from sushi and ramen to sesame matcha bun from scratch. This month, a one-off class offers guidance on how to make a heart-shaped chocolate cake. \\u00a0 Vancouver Book a table at \\u2026 Hawksworth, in the celebrated Rosewood Hotel Georgia, which brought luxury to the young Canadian west coast city in the Roaring \\u201920s and whose guests have included British royalty, Nat King Cole, and Marlene Dietrich (and her 40 suitcases).

The group had reported a 51.02% increase in net profit to RM11.15 million for the year ended May 31, 2016 (FY16), after registering a 7.2% decline in the bottom line to RM7.39 million in FY15 from RM7.96 million in FY14. For the first half of FY17, the group saw a 69.46% hike in net profit to RM6.58 million, from RM3.88 million in the same period of FY16. This is despite a 9.62% drop in revenue to RM587.51 million from RM650.08 million. \\u201cThe market condition [has] stabilised. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the [FY17] earnings should be better than last year\\u2019s,\\u201d said Nylex managing director Datuk Dr Siew Ka Wei. The group attributed the jump in FY16 net profit to better showing by its industrial chemicals division, which generated a higher profit before tax of RM11.9 million, against RM10.6 million in FY15, due to higher sales volume and improved margins. Founded in 1970, Nylex is principally involved in investment holding and the manufacturing and marketing of vinyl-coated fabrics, calendered film and sheeting and other plastic products, including geotextiles and prefabricated sub-soil drainage systems. About 89% of the group\\u2019s revenue is contributed by the industrial chemical division. Another 10% is derived from the polymer division, while the logistics division accounts for the remaining 1%. Nylex currently has offices in the entire Southeast Asian region except for Thailand and the Philippines. It is now seeking to expand into the remaining two Southeast Asian markets. \\u201cWe are one of the largest distributors. We have been in the distribution business since 1982,\\u201d said Siew. He said the group does not focus on any one type of business, with the diversified business serving as a \\u201cnatural hedge\\u201d. Siew added that the logistics division, which was incorporated into the group\\u2019s business model during the current financial year, would help Nylex integrate operationally and enhance efficiency. \\u201c[With the logistics division], it will be a fully integrated operation and it can provide customers with a lot of convenience,\\u201d he said, adding that the group will enjoy a cost advantage and also save its time. \\u201cWe try to strengthen the supply chain, so that it can support the distribution division,\\u201d he said. Looking back at the group\\u2019s performance over the years, Siew said profits continued to rise until 2008 when the oil prices continue to move up. He said that during the global financial crisis in 2008, most businesses stop stocking their products in the Southeast Asian region but Nylex continued to stock its products and made good profits a year later. \\u201cWe are strong because we own tanks and we have long-term leases,\\u201d he added. Last April, Nylex signed a contract for the construction and purchase of a chemical tanker. Constructed by Hakata Ship Building Co Ltd of Japan, the tanker sailed to Malaysia last month. Nylex is in the process of getting the necessary certification for the tanker from Petrolium Nasional Bhd (Petronas) and going forward, it is expected to be contributing positively. Nylex has cited the purchase of the tanker as the main factor for its borrowings amounting to RM126.27 million. \\u201cOur net debt is considerably low compared with other companies in the industry. There was this one meeting that we had and the fund manager said that we under-borrowed and should borrow more,\\u201d said Siew. On expansion plans, Siew said Nylex is looking at any business which is profitable. The group, he said, will continue its focus on cost control measures and increase operational efficiencies in order to improve profitability of its manufacturing business for both the polymer division and the industrial chemical division, and consider new opportunities of expanding the distribution network for its distribution business. Nylex\\u2019s share price rose 22% over the past year to 70.5 sen last Friday, with a market capitalisation at RM135.3 million. It is currently trading at a trailing 12-month price-earnings ratio of 9.63 times. Siew said the share price is undervalued as the group\\u2019s net asset per share is at RM1.70. He added that the group\\u2019s market value should be around RM300 million."}, "239": {"date_posted": "10/2/2017", "title": "Perwaja Holdings shares down 30% on aborted regularisation plan", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 10): Shares of\\u00a0Perwaja Holdings Bhd fell as much as 30% in early trading, after the Practice Note 17 steel maker aborted its regularisation plan, following the lapse of its agreements with Chinese conglomerate Tianjin Zhiyuan Investment Group Co Ltd (Zhiyuan). At the close of morning session, Perwaja's stock fell 3 sen or 30% to 7 sen, with 10.45 million shares traded, for a market capitalisation of RM39.2 million. Its 200-day average trading volume is about 1.18 million. Perwaja executive director Tan Sri Pheng Yin Huah told theedgemarkets.com today that the company aborted its plan, because it has yet to get the green light from its creditors, Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) and Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB), to the proposed regularisation scheme. \\u201cZhiyuan did not fulfil its promise [to bring in funds] on time. So Petronas and TNB didn\\u2019t accept and didn't agree with Zhiyuan\\u2019s proposed plan. We had to abort the plan,\\u201d he said via telephone. \\u201cWe will continue to look for a new partner, probably from China as well. We have to decide (on the next course of action) by the end of March,\\u201d Pheng added. In November last year, Pheng told The Edge weekly that the banks have accepted the restructuring plan, but Petronas and TNB, in which Perwaja owes RM132 million and RM250 million respectively, have yet to give their nod. At that time, Pheng did not foresee the two creditors blocking the plan, as he said they would be able to recover 70% of their outstanding amount. On Wednesday, Perwaja announced the proposed regularisation scheme has been aborted. The loss-making company said the parties were not able to fulfil the conditions precedent within the timeline stipulated under the master framework agreement and the supplemental master framework agreement signed between Perwaja, Perwaja Steel Sdn Bhd and Zhiyuan\\u2019s wholly-owned unit Zhiyuan International Investment & Holding Group (HK) Co Ltd. To recap, Perwaja and its subsidiary Perwaja Steel entered into a master framework agreement with Zhiyuan in July 2015, to formalise arrangements in relation to the proposed regularisation scheme. Under the deal, Zhiyuan was to pump in RM1.8 billion to revive the steel maker.

It was a quiet four days of trading due to the long new year weekend. During the period, the single largest transaction by volume was a direct deal of about 85.73 million AirAsia X Bhd shares, representing a 2.07% stake in the budget long-haul carrier. The block of shares was done at 38 sen apiece on Dec 28, valuing the stake at RM32.58 million. The transaction price was two sen or a 5.56% premium over the day\\u2019s close of 36 sen each. At press time, it is\\u00a0 not known who acquired the block of AirAsia X shares. Another notable transaction was the sale of 23 million shares in Boustead Holdings Bhd on Dec 28 at RM2.603 apiece or a total of RM59.87 million. The stake was likely bought by Boustead\\u2019s parent, Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera (LTAT), which has been increasing its shareholding in Boustead over the last few months. In the last few trading days of 2016, LTAT picked up another 27.42 million Boustead shares, including the 23.71 million shares it acquired on Dec 28, according to filings. LTAT now holds a 59.86% stake in Boustead. Market data show the 23 million shares were traded at RM2.603 each, or a total of RM59.87 million. This represents a slight discount to the day\\u2019s closing stock price of RM2.62. Boustead\\u2019s stock price had slumped to a low of RM1.783 but has since recovered to a high of RM2.672 on Dec 30. By value, the single largest transaction was 7.5 million Tenaga Nasional Bhd shares that changed hands on Dec 28 for RM102 million or RM13.60 each. The RM13.60 price tag for the block was in line with Tenaga\\u2019s closing price that day, which was at a six-month low. Many oil and gas-related counters saw a flurry of off-market activity. These included transactions at Borneo Oil Bhd, Bumi Armada Bhd, Carimin Petroleum Bhd, Hibiscus Petroleum Bhd, Perisai Petroleum Teknologi Bhd, SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd, Sumatec Resources Bhd, TH Heavy Engineering Bhd and Yinson Holdings Bhd. This is likely driven by hope that crude oil prices will fare better this year, with major oil-producing countries attempting to address the global oversupply. AmInvestment Research maintained its oil price projection at US$45 to US$50 per barrel compared with US$43 per barrel last year, while cautioning that macro-economic and policy uncertainties still linger. Hibiscus Petroleum saw a good amount of off-market activity, with a total of 45.31 million shares worth about RM18.34 million traded in dozens of transactions, priced at 38 sen to 43.5 sen apiece. Its shares staged a strong rally in the last quarter of 2016, more than doubling from under 20 sen last October to 45 sen per share on Jan 5.

The new wins prompted us to increase our earnings forecasts for financial year 2018 (FY18) and FY19 by 8% and 4% respectively.

We maintain \\u201cbuy\\u201d, but upgrade our sum-of-parts-based TP to RM2.05 (from RM1.84; an 18% upside). SapuraKencana was awarded contracts with a combined value of US$300 million for its E&C and drilling divisions on Monday. For E&C, it landed contracts by Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd for the provision of underwater services in Peninsular Malaysia, and for soil investigation services in Peninsular and East Malaysia.\\u00a0 The company also obtained contracts from Hyundai Heavy Industries Co Ltd for the offshore installation of a central processing platform for the Bardegg-2 and Baronia enhanced oil recovery projects, as well as transportation and installation for the Bunga Pakma field development project. SapuraKencana also announced an award for its tender assist drilling rig, SKD Alliance. We estimate that its E&C order book (ex-Brazil pipelay support vessel) is currently at US$950 million, with visibility up to FY21 (January). We estimate that SapuraKencana\\u2019s Brazil outstanding order book to be at about US$3.4 billion. Over the past one year, it has managed to add US$950 million worth of new orders for its E&C segment. We attribute this ability to beat the industry downturn to its sector-leading position in its ability to provide efficient upstream services. Recall that we have not imputed any new wins for its drilling segment in our Dec 9, 2016 upgrade note. The award for SKD Alliance, a firm five-year contract period plus an optional five years, came as a surprise. This prompted us to upgrade our revenue forecasts for the drilling wing by 10% and 3% for FY18 and FY19 respectively. For the energy segment, at US$70/bbl, we expect the company to register a 5% earnings upside from our crude oil price expectation of US$60/bbl. The US$300 million order book addition prompted us to upgrade our FY18 and FY19 earnings forecasts by 8% and 4% respectively. SapuraKencana is one of the top picks in the Malaysian O&G industry for its position as the bellwether of the sector, expectations of stabilisation of margins and a potential earnings upside from its E&C and drilling segments.

Fund managers and analysts are already expecting several world events next year that will cause more uncertainty. Indisputably, incoming US president Donald Trump\\u2019s foreign and trade policies will be closely monitored by the investing community, which is waiting to see if he will fulfil his policy pledges to \\u201cmake America great again\\u201d. Apart from that, there are also the elections that will be held in several European countries next year. Some fear that the voice of the \\u201canti-EU\\u201d may prevail as member countries continue to suffer years of high unemployment and tepid growth. Maybank Investment Bank Research highlights the risk of more aggressive US Federal Reserve rate hikes as a result of higher inflation and growth expectations from fiscal expansion plans in the US. \\u201cThis will, in turn, widen the monetary divergence between the US and the other major economies, especially with the European Central Bank having extended its quantitative easing to end-2017,\\u201d it says in a recent report. On the home front, some have singled out the 14th general election as a factor that could add uncertainty to the local stock market. However, those who believe in an election rally are expecting the polls to get the bulls charging in. To recap, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak hinted at the recent Umno General Assembly that the 14th general election \\u201ccould come anytime soon\\u201d. Despite the events that could cause market jitters next year, fund managers believe that there are still bright spots. Plantation is one sector that is starting to look interesting again. This is due to the unexpected rebound in crude palm oil (CPO) prices this year. Year to date, they have risen 36.14% to RM3,123 per tonne, the highest since July 2012. At the peak in 2010, it was RM3,619 per tonne. According to Inter-Pacific Securities head of research Pong Teng Siew, this is a good time for CPO as prices tend to move up between November and March because of low output. Maybank IB Research says in a note that it expects CPO prices to start the year on a high but foresees a correction in the second quarter before hitting the bottom in the third when production reaches its peak. The research house says the average selling price forecast for 2017 is RM2,400 per tonne. \\u201cPlantation is a long-term play. Look out for planters with young trees because that is where you will see growth in output,\\u201d says Phillip Capital Management chief investment officer Ang Kok Heng. Construction is another sector worth watching. With massive infrastructure development taking place, such as the mass rapid transit project and Pan-Borneo Highway, and more projects to be implemented over the next two years, construction players are bound to benefit from them. Significant projects slated for the next two years include the East Coast Rail Line, Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail, light rail transit Line 3, Gemas-Johor Baru double tracking and the remaining work for mass rapid transit Lines 2 and 3. There is also the RM30 billion Melaka Gateway trading port, a joint venture by state-funded KAJ Development Sdn Bhd and China-based conglomerate PowerChina International Group Ltd. \\u201cWe like pure construction players. There are a lot of contracts not rolled out yet. Furthermore, the weakness in the ringgit will not affect many of these players as they can source their raw materials locally,\\u201d says Ang. Etiqa Insurance and Takaful head of research Chris Eng prefers smaller construction players but cautions that some companies\\u2019 profit margins may be thin despite securing jobs. Meanwhile, the agreement between the oil producing nations and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) to cut production is expected to rebalance demand and supply of crude oil and provide some reprieve to oil prices. Maybank IB Research, which has upgraded the sector to \\u201cpositive\\u201d, believes that it is a good time to \\u201cbottom fish\\u201d as the sector has seen the bottom, with most stocks having lost much of their value. \\u201cThe sector is due for a cyclical recovery, on improving sentiment and operating outlook. We see further rerating prospects should Saudi Aramco\\u2019s investment of a 50% stake in Petronas\\u2019 RAPID (refinery and petrochemical integrated development) project materialise,\\u201d it says. Crude oil aside, the weaker ringgit has also continued to provide opportunity for export-oriented counters. Ang opines that the soft currency has made Malaysian exports more competitive. This bodes well for the export-oriented companies as well as those catering for both the local and foreign markets. \\u201cYes, export-oriented counters have benefited from [favourable] foreign exchange, but that is only a short-term gain. I believe that there is demand for Malaysian goods and they have become more competitive with the weaker ringgit. Companies with own-brand products should find themselves on a better footing,\\u201d he says. Etiqa\\u2019s Eng says investors should try to buy now and sell by April or May next year, given that most of the closely followed global events will take place in the middle of the year. \\u201cYes, there are definitely more uncertainties next year compared with 2016.\\u201d\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Tenaga Nasional Despite posting a commendable 10% y-o-y gain in core net profit to RM7.7 billion in its financial year ended Aug 31, 2016 (FY2016), TNB\\u2019s share price has been on a downward trend. At its close of RM13.74 last Thursday, the stock had lost 6.52% from its all-time high of RM14.67, recorded in the middle of the year. However, it was still 6.31% higher y-o-y. At this level, TNB is valued only at 10.53 times earnings. A report by TA Securities points out that this is one standard deviation away from the group\\u2019s historical (since 2000) average of 17.1 times. The weakness in TNB\\u2019s share price is indicative of selling by foreign funds, given the recent depreciation of the ringgit. However, it is important to note that there appears to be plenty of demand for TNB\\u2019s shares. Recall that Khazanah Nasional Bhd placed out a 1.5% block of TNB shares at RM14.30 apiece earlier this year. Moving forward, TNB is one of the few blue chips that near-guarantee stable earnings despite the increasingly volatile economic landscape. After all, under the new imbalance cost pass-through mechanism, all variations in fuel costs are passed on to consumers. Hence, neither a recovery in coal prices nor further depreciation of the ringgit should have a sizeable impact on TNB\\u2019s earnings. This resilience makes TNB one of the few defensive stocks that funds can rely on and it is definitely worth more than 10.53 times earnings. Nonetheless, the recent trend of awarding power projects to industry newcomers may cap some of the earnings growth over the next few years.\\u00a0 \\u2014 By Ben Shane Lim \\u00a0 \\u00a0 Gadang Holdings The construction and property developer has lost some of its lustre by becoming selective about its new jobs. Its net profit fell 20% y-o-y to RM16.7 million in the first quarter ended Aug 31. But of more concern is the 60% y-o-y drop in construction revenue during the quarter as its jobs wound up. It does not help that Gadang\\u2019s tender book, which stood at RM10 billion at the start of the year, has fallen to RM5.2 billion. But that is not necessarily a bad thing. Its management has always taken a conservative approach to bidding for work, preferring to avoid projects with low margins that cannot justify the risks. Gadang does not need to bag many projects, just the best ones. With MRT2 now in full swing, Gadang is expected to secure a package, given its performance in constructing viaducts for the first line. A single package would boost the group\\u2019s order book by RM1 billion. Meanwhile, there is the 37km-long LRT3 that Gadang is also bidding for. At last Thursday\\u2019s close of RM1.01, the company is valued at 6.51 times earnings, making it one of the cheapest construction stocks on the market. The average earnings multiple in the sector is 14 times. Beyond construction, Gadang has a sizeable property development arm. This year, the group became development partner for the 24.08-acre Kwasa Damansara township that has an estimated gross development value (GDV) of RM700 million. This is expected to start contributing to earnings in 2018. \\u2014 By Ben Shane Lim \\u00a0 Kerjaya Prospek Group A relatively new name on investors\\u2019 radar screens, the company is the product of a backdoor listing by Datuk Tee Eng Ho. The bulk of its construction business worth RM438 million was injected into it at the beginning of the year. It also came with an order book of RM2.7 billion and a profit guarantee of RM150 million over three years up to FY2018 ending Dec 31. Based on its closing price of RM2.08 last Thursday, Kerjaya Prospek had a market capitalisation of RM1 billion, valuing it at 11.55 times earnings. The company\\u2019s adjusted earnings per share for the year is estimated at 18 sen. Kerjaya Prospek is not a mere asset injection. This year, it managed to replenish its order book with RM1.5 billion worth of jobs, boosting the outstanding amount to RM2.89 billion and improving its earnings visibility. The company should be able to continue to fill its order book, thanks to the projects of its existing clientele, such as S P Setia Bhd\\u2019s Setia Sky Seputeh (GDV: RM950 million) and Eastern & Oriental Bhd\\u2019s Puro Place (GDV: RM800 million), notes Kenanga Research in a report. Kerjaya Prospek is also attractive for its cash-rich balance sheet, which is uncommon among its peers. The company still has a cash balance of RM109 million after paying a four sen per share dividend this year, which works out to cash per share of 21.4 sen. \\u2014 By Ben Shane Lim \\u00a0 \\u00a0 Sarawak Oil Palms SOP\\u2019s forward price-earnings ratio (PER) of 15.42 times is undemanding, especially compared to the average 2017 forecast PER of 19 times of its mid-cap peers. The planter\\u2019s proposal to fully acquire Shin Yang Oil Palm Sdn Bhd for RM873 million in July would add 47,000ha of plantation land to its land bank, of which 23,798ha are planted with oil palm and 6,772ha are unplanted. The average tree age in Shin Yang Oil Palm\\u2019s plantations is seven years, which would reduce the average age of SOP\\u2019s trees to 10.1 years post-acquisition from 11.1 years at present. It is worth noting that Shin Yang Oil Palm is being acquired from SOP\\u2019s major shareholder, Shin Yang Holding Sdn Bhd. \\u201cWe believe the young age profile of the acquisition and maturing area of about 2,200ha between 2017 and 2019 should contribute to above-average fresh fruit bunch growth from FY2017E onwards,\\u201d says Kenanga Research in an October report. To fund the acquisition, the planter issued 128 million renounceable rights shares on the basis of two for every seven SOP shares held. The rights issue was priced at RM2.80 apiece, below SOP\\u2019s market price. Despite a rebound in crude palm oil prices, SOP lagged behind its peers. At its close of RM3.71 last Wednesday, the stock had declined 8.65% year to date. \\u2014 By Esther Lee \\u00a0 \\u00a0 TSH Resources The mid-cap planter was among those that suffered from the effects of El Ni\\u00f1o this year. Nevertheless, analysts are expecting production to improve going forward. For the cumulative nine months ended Sept 30, TSH Resources recorded a net profit of RM81.6 million after stripping out foreign exchange gains and other exceptional items. About 80% of its revenue and profit is derived from its plantation business while the remaining 20% comes from its wood-product manufacturing and bio-integration divisions. It is worth noting that TSH Resources\\u2019 crude palm oil extraction rate is 21%, above the industry average of 20.46%. Its fresh fruit bunch yield is high at 24.7% per hectare compared with the industry average of 18.48% while its average tree age is young at eight years. The planter has 67,853ha of unplanted land, which should sustain its growth over the next 10 to 14 years, says BIMB Securities Research. TSH Resources has proposed to privatise its listed but loss-making subsidiary, Ekowood International Bhd, in which it holds a 67.46% stake. Analysts believe the privatisation will have negligible impact on the planter\\u2019s shareholders. At its closing price of RM1.87 last Thursday, the stock had lost 2.55% year to date. \\u2014 By Esther Lee \\u00a0 \\u00a0 MKH Based on a 2017 price-earnings ratio forecast of 6.65 times, the plantation and property player is a steal for investors, especially since it is expecting the earnings of its plantation division to double next year on the back of stronger crude palm oil prices and better yields. The trees in MKH\\u2019s 15,400ha plantation in Kalimantan, Indonesia, are expected to reach the peak of maturity next year. According to AllianceDBS Research, the estate is expected to achieve a yield of 29 tonnes per hectare, which the research house deems impressive, given the average tree age of seven years. The company plans to purchase 2,000ha of plantation land near its existing estate in Indonesia for RM15 million. This would increase its plantation area to about 18,000ha. As of now, the company\\u2019s largest contributing segment is still its property division, which accounts for 70% of its revenue. MKH has not been spared the effects of a soft property market. However, its focus on providing affordable homes resulted in unbilled sales of RM827.5 million as at Sept 30, which should keep the group going for 1\\u00bd years. The company has a sizeable land bank in the Kajang/Semenyih corridor, which will see it benefit from the completion of the MRT lines next year. MKH recently proposed a cash call followed by a bonus issue. Closing at RM2.86 last Thursday, the stock had gained 34.47% year to date.\\u00a0\\u2014 By Esther Lee \\u00a0 \\u00a0 SamChem Holdings In contrast to the general trend of disappointing corporate results, SamChem\\u2019s earnings are back on the growth path. It posted a net profit of RM11.48 million for the nine months ended Sept 30, 2016, up 48% from the previous corresponding period, while revenue grew 8.3% to RM483.7 million. Its management is confident of sustainable earnings growth, thanks to rising demand for petrochemicals in Asean, especially Vietnam and Indonesia, where manufacturing plants are sprouting up. \\u201cSales volume is growing 30% to 40%. The [growth] pattern is likely to continue, if not become stronger,\\u201d its CEO, Datuk Ng Lian Poh, told The Edge in an interview. According to him, selling prices have also stabilised. The homegrown speciality petrochemicals distributor has a foothold in Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam. With a market capitalisation of RM130 million, it evolved into a leading player in Asean after the consolidation of the regional industry in recent years. Ng believes there are exciting prospects for the petrochemicals industry in Vietnam and Indonesia. However, SamChem is not just targeting these two countries but the whole of Asean with its 450 million population. Demand for petrochemicals usually grows in tandem with increasing affluence. Given its current scale, SamChem forms part of the supply chain of many MNCs that have manufacturing facilities in the region. Furthermore, the high barriers to entry are advantageous to the company. SamChem\\u2019s earnings per share for 9MFY2016 was 8.44 sen. Based on an annualised EPS of 11.25 sen, the stock is trading at 11.28 times. \\u2014 By Kathy Fong \\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hong Leong Industries At its closing price of RM9.38 last Thursday, the company\\u2019s share price had gained 65.8% year to date. However, it was trading at a low 2017 price-earnings ratio forecast of 10.95 times. HL Industries has two core businesses \\u2014 the manufacturing and selling of fibre cement and concrete roofing products under its Hume brand and the more exciting business of manufacturing and trading Yamaha motorcycles in Malaysia and Vietnam through its 24% associate stake in Yamaha Motor Vietnam Co Ltd. Thanks to Vietnam\\u2019s fast-growing economy, many feel HL Industries is facing exciting days ahead. After all, the country has a young population of over 90 million, the vast majority of whom use motorcycles as their primary mode of transport. In its first quarter ended Sept 30, the company registered year-on-year revenue growth of 9%, attributable to strong sales of motorcycles and ceramic tiles. Net profit surged 44.5% to RM64.77 million on higher contribution from motorcycle sales. HL Industries\\u2019 Vietnam associate contributed RM30.7 million to earnings. In fact, HL Industries\\u2019 net profit in FY2016 jumped 42.7% year on year to RM247.22 million due to a higher contribution from its Vietnam associate. Kenanga Research says in a report that the company\\u2019s Yamaha motorcycles are enjoying increasing demand in Vietnam as a result of effective marketing strategies. Currently, Yahama motorcycles command a quarter of the Vietnamese market while Honda dominates 70% of it. \\u2014 By Esther Lee \\u00a0 \\u00a0 Kawan Food Well known for its frozen paratha, the company saw its earnings climb in its latest two quarters after a dip in the first quarter. For the cumulative nine months ended\\u00a0 Sept 30, its revenue increased to RM144.3 million, up 15.6% from a year ago, as it saw higher sales across all regions, save for Europe, while net profit registered a 2.8% growth to RM25.79 million. More than 60% of Kawan Food\\u2019s sales is derived from its export markets. The company has a strong following in the US, which accounted for 34% of its sales in the last nine months of its financial year. CIMB Research says in a report that steady sales in the domestic market also suggest that the frozen food manufacturer\\u2019s local business has recovered from the impact of the Goods and Services Tax. As at Sept 30, Kawan Food had a cash pile of RM67.58 million, and it declared a special dividend of 3.5 sen per share in November. This was on top of a 2.5 sen per share interim dividend that was announced in its third quarter results. At a 2017 price-earnings ratio forecast of 29.92 times, many would consider Kawan Food\\u2019s valuation lofty. However, the potential of better sales in its export markets, given that Malaysian exports have become more competitive with the weakening ringgit, could be a reason to give Kawan Food a second look. \\u2014 By Esther Lee \\u00a0 \\u00a0 E.A. Technique (M) It may not be hard to fathom why this oil and gas stock had tumbled nearly 47% year to date as at last Thursday. The prolonged industry downturn saw it slip from its peak of RM1.46 in August last year to a record low of 45 sen at end-November. It bounced back to 59 sen last Thursday but was still trading below its 2014 initial public offering price of 65 sen. Some fund managers opine that the counter has been oversold, given its high earnings visibility compared with its peers in the oil and gas industry. But its management must be puzzled at the selling pressure on the stock, although the company receives steady recurring income from its long-term charters. E.A. Technique managing director Datuk Abdul Hak Md Amin told The Edge that it was business as usual at the company despite the oil rout. \\u201cWe are less affected by the downturn in the oil and gas industry because our clients are mainly in the mid and downstream segments, such as petrochemical companies and refineries,\\u201d he said, adding that the utilisation of the company\\u2019s fleet of vessels was more than 90%. Furthermore, its vessels are chartered for transporting products, like gasoline and methanol, in the region. Thus, the risk of contract termination is low because the demand for such materials remains steady. For the nine months ended Sept 30, the company posted a higher net profit of RM30.49 million, or 6.05 sen per share, against RM26.19 million, or 5.2 sen per share, a year ago. In the meantime, the new vessels coming on stream with charters are expected to boost its earnings. \\u2014 By Kathy Fong \\u00a0 \\u00a0 EG Industries The Kedah-based company is a growth stock despite the current harsh economic climate. A new substantial shareholder brought change to the company, enabling it to climb the value chain by providing box-building and reap the benefits. Box-building refers to end-to-end manufacturing services that start at designing and end at the shipping of the completed products to end users. EG Industries has graduated from being just an original equipment manufacturer. It now serves world-renowned electrical and electronic brand names in several industries, including consumer electronics, ICT, medical, automotive and telecommunications. In FY2016 ended June 30, EG Industries posted a pre-tax profit of RM19.7 million, down from RM23.63 million the year before. However, it had booked a disposal gain of RM15.38 million in FY2015. Excluding the extraordinary gain, the group\\u2019s pre-tax profit would have been RM8.24 million that year. The company\\u2019s growth momentum continued in its 1QFY2017, with pre-tax profit rising 41.6% year on year to RM7.14 million. \\u201cWe like EG Industries for its gradual transition into a vertically integrated EMS (electronic manufacturing service) player through its continuous expansion into the higher margin, full-assembly services segment, and its projected three-year core earnings CAGR of 40%,\\u201d says UOB-Kay Hian. The research house sees the company\\u2019s net profit ballooning to RM30.6 million, or 11.4 sen per share, in FY2017 and RM36.7 million, or 13.6 sen per share, in FY2018. EG Industries\\u2019 share price was hovering in a tight range of 80 sen to 90 sen for most of the year. \\u2014 By Kathy Fong \\u00a0 \\u00a0 Kimlun Corp The Johor-based company has been a beneficiary of the property boom in the state. While having been involved in a large number of residential projects, Kimlun has also taken on infrastructure jobs in Johor. However, it has risen to prominence for manufacturing segmental box girders for the MRT project under its manufacturing division. At its near-record-high closing price of RM2.14 last Thursday, Kimlun\\u2019s share price had surged 56% year to date. However, its valuation, at 8.23 times earnings, is still not stretched. In the nine months ended Sept 30, the company\\u2019s net profit rose 17% year on year to RM57.7 million. Interestingly, revenue fell 14%, primarily due to lower contributions from the construction segment. The fall was compensated for by higher margins. Kimlun bagged RM1.1 billion of new construction jobs this year (compared with RM700 million in FY2015), boosting the group\\u2019s order book to RM1.93 billion. Its manufacturing segment, meanwhile, saw its orders double to RM300 million, driven by a RM200 million contract to supply segmental box girders for MRT2, which was awarded in March. Moving forward, the group is expected to bag the contract to supply tunnel lining segments for MRT2 as well. Kimlun also supplies pre-cast concrete products to Singapore. It is diversifying its offerings, now also supplying Singapore with rail sleepers and parapet walls. As a result, the company has benefited from the weaker ringgit. Kimlun has paid dividends consistently and is expected to declare a dividend of 6.8 sen this year, for a yield of 3.27%. At the same time, the group has a relatively healthy net gearing of 9.9%. \\u2014 By Ben Shane Lim \\u00a0"}, "246": {"date_posted": "5/1/2017", "title": "UMW, UWM-OG gain on Naga 7's 18-month contract ", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 5): Shares in UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd (UMW-OG) surged to its three-month high at mid-morning today, after its Naga 7 was awarded an 18-month contract by Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd.\\u00a0 At 9.55am, the stock narrowed its gains to trade at 93.5 sen, still up 2.5 sen or 2.75%, after climbing to a high of 94.5 sen shortly after opening bell.\\u00a0 A total of 1.42 million shares were exchanged between 91 sen and 94.5 sen.

Secondly, the Development of Kwasa Damansara Plot C-8 worth RM3.08 billion, Kuala Lumpur Sports City valued at RM1.6 billion and Cyberjaya City Centre with a gross development value of RM9 billion and finally the potential sale of the Eastern Dispersal Link (EDL) highway for RM1.8 billion to unlock its balance sheet. Tune Protect Group Bhd (Buy rating with TP of RM2.18) MIDF Research is overweight on Tune Protect Group premised on the fact that the group has a first mover's advantage of digital insurance space and it will continuously grow within that parameter. Tune has also predominant market share in local travel insurance and extends to establish new airline partnerships and venture beyond airline industry in the next two years. This will translate into positive significant fundamental impact, which the firm expects a sturdy FY17 estimated earnings growth and improvement in underwriting margin of 15% and 23% respectively. On balance sheet, the group will stand on strong forecasted double-digit return on equity of 17% and a net cash position. Malaysian Bulk Carriers Bhd (Maybulk) (Buy rating with TP of RM1.04) The Baltic Dry Index (BDI), which measures charter rates across dry bulk ship sizes and routes, has recently surpassed the 1,200 level after averaging at 500 for the majority of 1HFY16. The recent surge in the BDI can be attributed to a recent increase in coal and iron ore imports from China due to lower domestic production of these materials and a pick-up in demand for construction and power generation. In addition, the prospects of the US embarking on infrastructure spending as part of its stimulus measures have also propped up sentiment on the industry. The firm's 'buy' call on Maybulk with target price of RM1.04 is based on five-year average price-to-book ratio of 0.88x. Deleum Bhd (Buy rating with TP of RM1.25) Deleum is an oil and gas services specialist with undemanding valuation currently trading at forward price-earnings ratio (PER) of only 7x. The company's orderbook stands at approximately RM2.9 billion, providing earnings visibility of up to four years. In addition, the company is a frontrunner for Petronas maintenance, construction and modification works worth approximately RM500 million for its portion. The TP of RM1.25 is based on earnings per share (EPS17) of 12.5 sen pegged to PER17 of 10x. The firm's target PER17 is based on its five-year historical average rolling PER. At peak valuation, the stock traded at PERs in excess of 18x. Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd (Buy rating with TP of RM3.05) Key catalysts for the group are a construction orderbook of RM3 billion providing 36-month construction backlog or 3.5x construction revenue, a steady growth of 15% from operating income and an annual growth of 5 million from 3.3 million passengers (11% growth rate) for the three concession airports: Siem Reap, Sihanoukville and Phnom Penh, Cambodia. AirAsia Bhd (Buy rating with TP of RM3.45) MIDF Research said Airasia makes a re-entry into its top 10 picks after a recent share price correction which saw a 21% drop from its high of RM3.20 reached in August 2016 stemming from the ringgit losing ground against the greenback. However, the research house said it was not too concerned about the falling ringgit as AirAsia's unhedged exposure to US dollar for its borrowings and expenses are capped at 33% and 50% respectively. Meanwhile, AirAsia recently recorded a cumulative nine-month (9MFY16) load factor of 89% which was a group record. Looking ahead, the fourth quarter of 2016 will be even better as October\\u2013November loads have already hit 93%. AirAsia highlighted that it has received eight non-binding bids for full ownership in Air Aviation Capital and one for an 80% stake. MIDF Research said it is increasingly optimistic on the potential for special dividends as the deal draws nearer to a possible conclusion. It said that a divestment of a 70% to 80% stake in AirAsia's leasing arm could translate into proceeds of RM2.9 billion to RM3.3 billion (RM1.04 to RM1.19 per share) which could be used to pare debts, fund future expansion and be paid out as special dividends. Ta Ann Holdings Bhd (Buy rating with TP of RM4.70) MIDF Research favours the company for its good set of earnings in 9MFY16 due to better-than-expected fruit bunch production, its strongest production growth among peers (+8% year-on-year (y-o-y) in 9MFY16) and a better outlook for timber division due to recent strengthening of US dollar and Sarawak State Government's effort to promote timber products in Japan. My E.G. Services Bhd (MyEG) (Buy rating with TP of RM2.84) MIDF Research said MyEG has an attractive business model and strong cash-rich balance sheet. As at 1QFY17, it has a net cash position of RM49.7 million. It is also enjoying an attractive profit margin of more than 50%. The upcoming implementation of the customs tax projects would also reaffirm the group's revenue and earnings growth trajectory. Our TP of RM2.84 is premised on FY18 EPS of 10.8 sen pegged to FY18 forward PER of 26.3x. Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (Buy rating with TP of RM29.05) Key positives about the company include its high exposure to palm oil business and good earnings growth of +33% y-o-y to RM1.05 billion in FY16, new capacities in the fatty acid business has started to contribute positively to the company, with FY16 EBIT for downstream division surging by 75% to RM323 million. Bermaz Auto Bhd (Buy rating with TP of RM2.45) MIDF Research said significant value has emerged after a 10% fall in share price since the market selldown post-US elections. Ex-cash, Bermaz Auto now trades at just 9x CY17 earnings. The Japanese yen has actually weakened to RM3.80\\u2013RM3.90 levels and it was mainly the US dollar (which Bermaz Auto has no exposure to) that strengthened against the ringgit in the past month. Key share price catalysts over the next 12 months include an attractive dividend yield of 7% (based on 85% payout ratio) underpinned by net cash which accounts for 12% of market capitalisation and a solid 9% free cash flow to equity yield (FY17F). \\u00a0"}, "249": {"date_posted": "21/12/2016", "title": "KLCI down with Petronas Dagangan, KLK as Bursa volume falls", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 21): The FBM KLCI fell 4.93 points or 0.3% mainly on late selling of Petronas Dagangan Bhd and Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KLK) shares.

David Smith, who is head of corporate governance at Aberdeen Asia, said the EPS growth of Malaysian corporates is expected to be higher than the forecast 4% to 5% of gross domestic product growth for Malaysia in 2017. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s positive for us on Malaysian equities is that domestic consumption has stayed resilient despite the goods and services tax [implemented in 2015]. \\u201cWe think Malaysia is somewhat attractive within this region, [but it comes down to] stock selection. We have to find companies that are going to be leveraging off domestic consumption and demand,\\u201d he said at a news conference in conjunction with Aberdeen\\u2019s \\u201cAugmented Reality\\u201d presentation yesterday. Aberdeen Asia-Pacific head of multi-asset solutions Irene Goh said that at present, Malaysia and other Asian equity markets are not seeing a multiple expansion in indices due to uncertainties such as the pressure on currencies and capital flight from emerging markets. \\u201cHopefully when we get to 2017, there will be more clarity on trade policies, and [if] Donald Trump the pragmatist and businessman shows up in the White House rather than Donald Trump the populist, maybe we can get tailwinds that are supportive of better market performance for equities in the region,\\u201d she said. As for the outlook for fixed income investment in Malaysia, Aberdeen Islamic Asset Management investment manager Mohammad Hasif said that bonds with longer terms, or at the \\u201clong end\\u201d of the curve, are attractive. \\u201cAt Aberdeen, we have been fundamentally positive on Malaysia for some time, so we took opportunities in the longer end of the Malaysian bond space, basically 20- to 30-year Malaysian Government Securities, as we think that part looks attractive, even on a forward-looking basis. \\u201cThe longer end of the Malaysian government bond space has generally been well supported by the Employees Provident Fund, insurance companies and pension funds, so we think that part of the bond curve is well anchored,\\u201d he said. Mohammad Hasif said another theme adopted by Aberdeen is to move into US dollar Malaysian bonds. \\u201cUS dollar Malaysian issuances such as Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) issuances and Axiata Group Bhd\\u2019s [US dollar bonds] which have [been] sold off and had been expensive previously, have now started to look quite cheap. \\u201cSo what we have done is switching from some of our expensive bonds such as [South] Korean US dollar bonds to some of the Malaysian bonds which have started to look cheap after the sell-off. For US dollar credits, we look at it more on a spread basis as opposed to an outright yield. \\u201cWe are fundamentally positive on these companies. Petronas, for example, despite the [low] oil prices, has had a very disciplined management of its finances, and has a very pragmatic management of its capex (capital expenditure) programmes. So with that, and a cheap valuation, it was a very easy decision for us to make,\\u201d he said. Total assets under management for Aberdeen Asia amounted to US$76.2 billion (RM339.85 billion) as at September 2016."}, "252": {"date_posted": "17/11/2016", "title": "Lim to inject WCT assets into Pavilion REIT ", "article": " \\u00a0 BUSINESSMAN Tan Sri Desmond Lim Siew Choon is performing a corporate manoeuvre that may unlock value worth billions after emerging as the largest shareholder in WCT Holdings Bhd last Tuesday, say sources. At the heart of Lim\\u2019s plan is the injection of WCT\\u2019s three shopping malls into Pavilion Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), in which he and his wife, Tan Kewi Yong, together hold a 37.35% stake. This will, in turn, help WCT clean up its balance sheet and lower its gearing ratio, which analysts believe will remove a persistent discount on the company\\u2019s share price. While WCT had previously mooted a possible REIT listing of its malls by the end of the year, injecting them into an existing REIT would prove faster and easier to accomplish. Analysts have pegged a valuation of RM1.2 billion to WCT\\u2019s three malls, namely Paradigm Mall in Petaling Jaya, AEON Bukit Tinggi Shopping Centre in Klang and [email\\u00a0protected] in Sepang. The group has another Paradigm Mall coming up in Johor Baru that is scheduled to open next April, according to its website. To recap, Lim got the market excited last Tuesday after he surfaced in WCT as its biggest shareholder with a 19.67% stake. His vehicle, Dominion Nexus Sdn Bhd, had acquired the shares in a direct deal from WCT Capital Sdn Bhd, which is the vehicle of WCT co-founders Peter Taing Kim Hwa and Wong Sewe Wing. The acquisition price was not disclosed to Bursa Malaysia. However, Bloomberg data shows that several blocks of shares transacted at RM2.50 apiece last Tuesday, representing a premium of 42.85% to the stock\\u2019s closing price of RM1.75 that day. At RM2.50 each, the transaction would have cost Lim a total of RM614.3 million. Following the property tycoon\\u2019s emergence in WCT, the company saw a boardroom shake-up with the old guard making way for Lim\\u2019s new line-up. In a flurry of filings with Bursa last Wednesday, WCT announced that Datuk Capt Ahmad Sufian @ Qurnain Abdul Rashid had given up his post as board chairman. Lim is taking his place as executive chairman with immediate effect. Meanwhile, Taing has resigned as managing director, citing his cessation as a substantial shareholder of the group. Executive director Wong Yik Kae, who is Sewe Wing\\u2019s son, has also exited the company to pursue personal interests, as has non-executive director Choo Tak Who. Two independent, non-executive directors \\u2014 Tan Sri Marzuki Mohd Noor and Datuk Abdul Wahab Khalil \\u2014 have been named to the board, as has Datuk Lee Tuck Fook as non-independent, non-executive director. Property developer Malton Bhd, in which Lim and his wife hold 35.34% equity interest via Malton Corp Sdn Bhd, also announced last Tuesday that Lim will be redesignated from executive chairman to non-independent, non-executive chairman from Jan 2. It cited Lim\\u2019s entry into WCT as the reason he relinquished his executive role in Malton. While the exact terms of the mall injection are unclear for now, a cash payment for the assets would be a boon for WCT, which has been saddled with high gearing and a capital-intensive property operation that has been dragging its cash flow. As at June 30, WCT had total borrowings of RM2.73 billion, RM578.5 million cash and total equity of RM2.707 billion, which translated into a net gearing ratio of 0.79 times. The group burnt cash in four of six consecutive financial quarters up to June 30. An analyst suggests that this may be why the stock is relatively undervalued despite jumping 5.9% the day after news broke about the emergence of a new shareholder. It closed at RM1.80 last Wednesday. Its price-earnings ratio (PER) that day was 10.92 times compared with its peers\\u2019 average of 16.73 times, based on Bloomberg data. Hong Leong Investment Bank and AmInvestment Bank ascribed a sum-of-parts (SOP) valuation of RM3.52 billion and RM3.98 billion respectively to WCT compared with its market value of RM2.25 billion at the close of trading last Thursday. The SOP valuations translate into an implied share price of RM2.12 and RM2.38 each. This means Lim may have put a much higher valuation on WCT if he had indeed bought in at RM2.50 apiece on Nov 1. The huge premium may also represent a carrot to WCT\\u2019s co-founders to exit immediately rather than pursue a longer-term, value-unlocking strategy via the original REIT listing proposal. One possibility is that the RM2.50 share price is the valuation Lim is eyeing when the dust settles on his upcoming plan to unlock value in WCT via Malton and Pavilion REIT. \\u201cOf course, there would be concerns [among the minority shareholders] over whether the valuation is fair,\\u201d says an analyst. Sources say following the injection of WCT\\u2019s malls into Pavilion REIT, the next step could be to streamline Malton\\u2019s construction business into WCT, which is far larger and has an established track record. For perspective, Malton\\u2019s market capitalisation as at Nov 3 was RM302.7 million or just under 14% that of WCT. WCT\\u2019s construction order book stands at RM4.28 billion, a quarter of which is from its contracts totalling RM1.1 billion at the Petronas Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development project. Its construction arm saw total revenue of RM1.51 billion in the second quarter ended June 30 (2QFY2016), of which 58% were external sales. In comparison, Malton\\u2019s construction arm reported a turnover of RM503.7 million in 2QFY2016 \\u2014 57.4% of which was internal, meaning it was undertaking its own construction projects. With a common major shareholder in Lim, these construction jobs are likely to be fed to WCT, boosting the latter\\u2019s construction business. Streamlining the construction businesses under WCT would pave the way for Malton to focus on its property business, which is what the company is primarily known for. Similarly, WCT\\u2019s property division is relatively small compared with its larger operation as a group. In 2QFY2016, this segment accounted for only 14.7% of quarterly group revenue, although its contribution to operating profit was larger at 43.1%. Analysts generally agree that it is still early days to tell how the minority shareholders will be affected by Lim\\u2019s plan. In a Nov 2 report, AllianceDBS Research says Lim\\u2019s emergence has cast uncertainty on the future direction of the company until more details are announced. HLIB echoes the sentiment, saying a potential risk is a significant change in WCT\\u2019s strategic direction. Other analysts, however, feel that Lim\\u2019s presence as a shareholder is an upside for WCT, given his successful Pavilion brand name, noted business acumen and reputation for deal-making. For now, this is a space to watch for Corporate Malaysia observers.\\u00a0 \\u00a0"}, "253": {"date_posted": "17/11/2016", "title": "Dayang Enterprise seen as one of the front runners for MCM works", "article": " \\u00a0 Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd\n(Nov 16, 78 sen)Upgrade to buy with an unchanged target price (TP) of 95 sen: Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd\\u2019s third quarter of financial year 2016 (3QFY16) earnings is likely to swing into the black due to lower one-off expenses during the quarter, coupled with more aggressive cost-cutting initiatives at both Perdana Petroleum Bhd and the parent company.

On PetDag's retail segment, MIDF Research said both revenue and profit posted declines of 13% and 25.8% respectively due to a 14% decline in average selling price, which had impacted the diesel and mogas fuel contributions. \"The declines were further exacerbated by impairment charge on receivables of RM89.9 million and higher operating expenditure,\" it added.

According to the automotive parts and components maker, a new joint venture company (JV Co) will be incorporated in Vietnam under the proposed name 'APM TACHI-S Seating Systems Vietnam Co Ltd', with an investment capital and charter capital of US$2.5 million. APM Automotive will contribute 49% or US$1.23 million to the JV Co, while TACHI-S will contribute 51% or US$1.275 million. Besides the business of developing, manufacturing, assembling and selling automotive seats in Vietnam for OEM, the JV Co may also undertake other businesses that are deemed fit and beneficial to both JV parties Loss-making SMTrack Bhd has proposed to acquire U.S.-based Wellspring Worldwide Ltd for an undisclosed amount. \\u00a0 Wellspring Worldwide is the global master licensor of Tutti Fruitti Frozen Yogurt, O'My Buns! and YoFlavor. SMTrack said the purchase consideration will be decided upon completion of a due diligence conducted by the company, and will be satisfied by issuance of new SMTrack shares. \"The proposed acquisition is subject to the vendors providing a profit guarantee on the minimum profit after tax of the Wellspring Group for two financial years, following the completion of the proposed acquisition,\" it added. \\u00a0\\u00a0\nPetronas Gas Bhd signed an agreement today to set up a joint venture company with Linde (M) Sdn Bhd to develop an air separation unit (ASU) plant in Pengerang, Johor. Petronas Gas said it will hold a 51% stake in the venture, while Linde, which is involved in the manufacturing and distribution of industrial gases, will own 49%. It said the plant is being set up at the Pengerang Integrated Complex to meet its demand for gaseous oxygen and gaseous nitrogen. \\u201cThe revenue stream is expected to cover capital and operational expenditure for the construction and operations of facilities. \\u201cThe total project cost is estimated at US$172 million, with Petronas Gas\\u2019 portion of the cost amounting to an estimated US$88 million. The source of funding for the project is expected to be via a combination of equity and debt from the respective parties,\\u201d said Petronas Gas. Higher contribution from its solar segment business lifted Tek Seng Holdings Bhd's second quarter net profit by more than four-fold to RM16.23 million or 4.89 sen per share, from RM3.69 million or 1.5 sen per share a year ago. \\u00a0 Revenue for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016 (2QFY16) doubled to RM159.53 million, from RM78.87 million previously, due to higher sales across all its business segments. The Penang-based PVC products manufacturer turned solar cell maker, declared a one sen interim dividend, payable on Sept 9. \\u00a0 According to its filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Teck Sing\\u2019s solar segment swung into the black with a profit of RM13.23 million, as compared with a loss of RM3.66 million a year ago. \\u00a0 Stronger ringgit boosted Guan Chong Bhd's net profit for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016 (2QFY16) to RM10.66 million, which is over five times the RM1.96 million it had recorded in the same period last year. The leading cocoa processor in Asia told the stock exchange today that better earnings were due to higher net gain on foreign exchange. Revenue, on the other hand, only gained 1.2% to RM583.39 million, from 576.56 million a year ago, which is mainly due to higher average selling price of cocoa solids. The stronger quarterly earnings also lifted its net profit for the cumulative six months ended June 30, 2016 (1HFY16) to RM24.36 million, from RM108,000 a year earlier; while revenue improved 14.7% to RM1.17 billion, from RM1.02 billion. Federal Furniture Holdings (M) Bhd proposes to acquire 60% of construction company Pembinaan Masteron Sdn Bhd (PMSB) for RM33 million, in order to diversify its core business. The group expects the new construction business to grow and subsequently contribute positively to its earnings and profitability, it said it a filing to the bourse today. Federal Furniture said the proposed acquisition would be satisfied via a combination of RM6 million cash and an issuance of 270 million new redeemable convertible preference shares of 10 sen each in the furniture company. \\u201cPresently, the group\\u2019s revenue is principally derived from manufacturing and trading of furniture, as well as undertaking interior fit-outs projects, primarily for the property development and hospitality sectors,\\u201d it said. The group said the acquisition would enable it to diversify its revenue streams and reduce its dependency on the current core activities, as well as to derive synergistic benefits."}, "273": {"date_posted": "11/8/2016", "title": "Cover Story:Corporate Malaysia paid lower dividends in 1Q2016 ", "article": " \\u00a0 IN the current low interest rate environment, investors are increasingly turning to dividend-paying stocks for yields and safety. Despite declining earnings in the past two years, most companies listed on Bursa Malaysia have been able to maintain their dividend payouts at above 3%. However, some pertinent questions come to mind, especially for income investors: Can the companies maintain dividends amid a slowing economy? What sectors and companies are reducing dividends? And more importantly, are there any sectors or companies that are paying better dividends? By compiling data from cash flow statements, Chart 1 shows the dividends paid to shareholders in the past five years and the first quarter of 2016. While companies may pay dividends in the next quarter after they have declared the quantum, most of them pay out at a predictable frequency and time every year, making such cash flow data comparable on a year-on-year basis. That said, it should be noted that the dividend data from cash flow statements is lagging by a quarter and it disregards the sources of the funds, that is, the dividends could come from non-operating activities. For instance, companies could sell their assets and pay dividends with the proceeds. As shown in Chart 1, dividends paid by Bursa-listed companies dropped 6.3% to RM11.6 billion from a year ago, albeit by a lesser extent compared with an 18.4% fall in aggregate 1Q2016 corporate earnings. Sectors that paid lower dividends in the first quarter \\u2014 a RM2.3 billion reduction \\u2014 include plantation, telecommunications, oil and gas and automotive (see Chart 2). \\u00a0 Dividend cut by heavyweight sectors The plantation sector accounted for 28.7% of the RM2.3 billion reduction in dividends, followed by conglomerate (26%), telecommunications (17.3%), oil and gas equipment and services (5.8%) and automotive (3.8%). Together, the five sectors (based on Bloomberg classification) accounted for 82% of the amount. At the company level, conglomerate Sime Darby Bhd saw the biggest reduction in dividend payout \\u2014 RM639 million \\u2014 in the first quarter due to lower earnings from its plantation, industrial and motor segments (see Table 1). Note that the plantation segment was the group\\u2019s largest earnings contributor, accounting for a quarter of its revenue and a third of its operating income in FY2015. Other plantation companies that cut dividend sharply include Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KLK) and IOI Corp Bhd, which were affected by weak crude palm oil prices last year. While KLK saw its FY2015 earnings fall 12.3% to RM869.9 million from a year ago, IOI Corp\\u2019s earnings plunged 95% to\\u00a0 RM168.1 million from FY2014, mainly due to its large US dollar debt exposure. As for Kulim Malaysia Bhd, the company paid a special dividend of RM500 million in 1Q2015 instead of an interim dividend like in 2014. This came about after it disposed of New Britain Palm Oil Ltd to Sime Darby. Having completed its capital reduction and repayment exercise on July 5, Kulim is in the process of being taken private by controlling shareholder Johor Corp. Over at DiGi.Com Bhd, the dividend cut reflects its lower profitability due to intensifying competition and the fact that it has been paying out close to 100% of its profits in the past three years. As Maxis Bhd has so far maintained its profitability relatively well, the dividend cut last year was because it lowered its dividend payout ratio to below 100% and stopped borrowing to pay dividends. Shares of Maxis and DiGi have been recovering since May, partly due to decent yields \\u2014 3.3% for Maxis and 4.3% for DiGi. Nonetheless, with competitive pressures limiting growth opportunities (for example, Telekom Malaysia Bhd\\u2019s (TM) new 4G LTE mobile service webe) and the upcoming spectrum reallocation exercise, dividend upside for this sector seems limited and there is a possibility of further dividend cuts due to either spectrum fees or lower profitability. \\u00a0 Higher dividends by GLCs Sectors that paid higher dividends contributed RM1.5 billion more in the first quarter, mostly led by individual companies (see Chart 3 and Table 2). TM, MISC Bhd, Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd, Petronas Gas Bhd \\u2014 government-linked companies (GLCs) with a dominant industry position or strong parentage backing \\u2014 accounted for over 60% of the amount. However, at a closer look, things are not exactly rosy. For TM, the RM455 million paid out in 1Q2016 was due to a change in the timing of dividend payments. The integrated\\u00a0 telecoms service provider, which is 28.6%-owned by Khazanah Nasional Bhd, changed the dividend type of its second payout for FY2015 from final to second interim dividend, accelerating its dividend payment by two to three months to 1Q2016. MISC, which is 62.7%-owned by Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas), raised its dividend payout ratio from 10.7% in 2013 to 54.3% last year. The shipping company paid out\\u00a0 RM401.7 million in 2014 and 50% more last year, although earnings grew only 12% in the same period. In 1H2016, dividends rose to\\u00a0 RM1 billion, 66.7% higher than that of last year. The higher dividends could be attributed to the disposal of its international tank terminal business, VTTI BV, for RM3.4 billion in 4Q2015 as part of its initiative to hive off uncompetitive non-core businesses. MISC is currently divesting its logistics arm, MISC Integrated Logistics Sdn Bhd, which is expected to bring about RM358 million in total proceeds. The stock took a dive in late April from RM8.90 to a one-year low of RM7.25 on May 9, following consensus earnings cut due to the weaker outlook for petroleum and liquefied natural gas shipping rates. Data compiled by Bloomberg shows that the street expects MISC\\u2019s operating profit to decline 21% this year, with a lower yield of 2.9%. Another Petronas subsidiary that paid higher dividends is Petronas Chemicals. It paid 25% or RM160 million more in the first quarter. As the petrochemical company has been paying out about 50% of its profits, the bigger payout was because of improved profitability last year. Despite a 7.3% drop in revenue due to lower crude oil prices, net profit rose 12.9% year on year to RM2.8 billion, thanks to a higher plant utilisation rate of 85% and weaker ringgit. Supported by its strong cash flow generation, Petronas Chemicals is expanding its capacity over the next few years through the Sabah ammonia urea project and the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development Project in Johor. Taking the multi-year capacity expansion plan into account, analysts are forecasting 10.2% earnings growth for the company next year. Other non-GLCs that paid higher dividends in 1Q2016 include property investment company Selangor Properties Bhd, brewer Heineken Malaysia Bhd, Hong Leong Bank Bhd and hard disk drive component maker JCY International Bhd. Both Selangor Properties and JCY incurred a loss in the latest quarter, largely due to foreign exchange losses on overseas investments and receivables/hedging instruments. Mounting dividend risk with declining profits While companies could liquidate assets or borrow to pay dividends, the ability to sustain and grow dividends is still driven by profitability. As shown in Chart 4, corporate profits in the past five quarters have been particularly impacted by rising operating costs as well as ringgit volatility, which led to foreign exchange losses and higher import costs. Despite the declining earnings from 1Q2015 to 4Q2015, listed companies have been paying a similar level of dividends throughout the year, resulting in a jump in dividend payout ratio from 53% in 1Q2015 to 72% in 4Q2015. As this practice is not sustainable, 1Q2016 saw a reduction in dividends. Nevertheless, as some companies may not pay dividends in the first quarter, the 1Q2016 dividend data may not be complete and sufficient enough to identify sectors or firms that have been growing their dividends. Hence, we have also compiled a list of the top 50 companies that have paid higher dividends (in absolute value) in the past five years (see Table 3 on Page 68). Many of these dividend growers have unique competitive strengths to capture the growth of their respective industry. That said, past performance is by no means indicative of future results and certain companies like DiGi and Sime Darby have reduced their dividends due to new industry developments. As dividends include proceeds from asset disposals, an increased payout could indicate a business restructuring or change in business model and, thus, may warrant a closer look. For example, both MISC and RCE Capital Bhd paid out much higher dividends last year as a result of initiatives to focus on their core business or to achieve a more efficient capital structure.\\u00a0"}, "274": {"date_posted": "10/8/2016", "title": "CIMB downgrades Petronas Gas", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 10): CIMB Investment Bank Bhd cut its current year Petronas Gas Bhd (PetGas) earnings per share (EPS) forecast by 2% after taking into account higher cost.

EARLY last month, Otto Marine Ltd, which owns a large fleet of offshore support vessels, became the first company listed on the Singapore Exchange to be taken private since the onset of a downturn in the oil and gas sector. Controlling shareholder Yaw Chee Siew, via his vehicle Ocean International Capital Ltd, offered 32 Singapore cents (96 sen) per share or a total of S$26.37 million (about RM79 million) for the 38.8% stake in Otto Marine that he does not own. Yaw is the son of Tan Sri Yaw Teck Seng, the patriarch of the Samling group, which has interests in the plantation, logging, property development and automotive sectors, among others. The senior Yaw is listed by Forbes as Malaysia\\u2019s 19th richest man. Prior to the general offer, Otto Marine was trading at a heavy discount to its book value at 0.17 times. Interestingly, since the offer by the Yaw family, a possible privatisation wave is expected to hit the republic. Analysts and market watchers have a long list of potential privatisation candidates, including ASL Marine Holdings Ltd, PACC Offshore Services Holdings Ltd (in which Malaysian Bulk Carriers Bhd owns a 21% stake), Marco Polo Marine Ltd, Mermaid Maritime Public Co Ltd, Baker Technology Ltd, CSE Global Ltd, Dyna-Mac Holdings Ltd. In Malaysia, while some industry players have admitted to having contemplated a privatisation, obtaining funding seems to be an uphill task, given the rather unexciting economic outlook. Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) president and CEO Datuk Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin summed it up well in an interview with The Edge recently on mergers and acquisitions: \\u201cBecause of the difficulty in predicting what the future prices will be, there is a very big gap in terms of expectation from the buyer\\u2019s and seller\\u2019s side. The buyer\\u2019s side will say oil price will continue (being depressed) for a long time but the seller\\u2019s side will say, no, it will pick up.\\u201d \\u00a0 This scenario could be true for privatisations as well, perhaps. An analyst says she sees only one likely candidate \\u2014 Bumi Armada Bhd, whose share price had been beaten down to 65 sen at end-May. \\u201cThere are many factors at play when you talk about a privatisation, most importantly, whether you can get the requisite funding. How much of the company does the controlling shareholder own, can they raise funds?\\u201d Here are some companies that a handful of industry players and analysts think may take the privatisation route. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 Bumi Armada Billionaire T Ananda Krishnan controls 34.92% of the company. At its closing price of 73 sen last Tuesday, Bumi Armada\\u2019s market capitalisation was RM4.28 billion compared with RM15.5 billion at its peak of RM2.64 in April 2012.\\u00a0 It would cost Ananda Krishnan some RM2.8 billion to buy out the other shareholders, excluding any premium. Bumi Armada has an order book of RM24.2 billion and an extension option of RM12.2 billion. The company is in the process of completing the conversion of three floating production storage and offloading vessels while the floating storage unit Malta is undergoing conversion this year. In 1QFY2016 ended March 31, Bumi Armada posted a net profit of RM23.43 million on revenue of RM430.77 million. Its cash pile stood at RM859.82 million while on the other side of the balance sheet, it had long-term borrowings of RM6.04 billion and short-term debt of RM1.44 billion. Its net asset value per share was RM1.14. While there has been talk of Ananda Krishnan looking to sell his block to MISC Bhd or Shapoorji Pallonji Mistry, none of it can be substantiated. \\u00a0 Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd\\u00a0 Earlier this year, there was talk of the company being taken private but this did not materialise. \\u00a0 MISC Bhd holds a 66.5% stake in the group while Petronas controls 62.7% of MHB.\\u00a0 Since September 2014, MHB\\u2019s shares have tumbled more than 65%. They closed at RM1.12 last Tuesday, giving the company a market capitalisation of RM1.79 billion. In the first quarter of FY2016, MHB suffered a net loss of RM7.58 million compared with a net profit of RM36.03 million in the previous corresponding period. Revenue plunged to RM256.72 million from RM719.50 million previously. However, oil and gas stalwarts doubt that MHB will be privatised. \\u201cIt (MHB) was listed in late October 2010. The talk then was that Petronas wanted to share some of its wealth, thus the listing of some of its companies,\\u201d an oil and gas executive says. \\u00a0 SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd The company\\u2019s shares hit a record low of RM1.29 on June 27 but rebounded to close at RM1.44 last Tuesday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM8.63 billion. Other than the challenging environment, Seadrill Ltd, the vehicle of billionaire tycoon John Fredriksen, sold out of SapuraKencana in April, adding to the gloom. At its peak, Seadrill held about 12% of SapuraKencana but gradually pared down its holding in large tranches as the company suffered from the fall in oil prices. \\u00a0 The shares have shed 65% of their value since September 2014. As at April 30, the company\\u2019s net asset value per share was RM1.98. In the first quarter ended April 30, SapuraKencana posted a net profit of RM110.31 million from RM1.94 billion in revenue. The Shamsuddin family, which is the controlling shareholder with a 17% stake, would have to fork out close to RM6.94 billion in market value to privatise SapuraKencana, excluding any premium offered. The Employees Provident Fund is the second largest shareholder with 15% while the others are Permodalan Nasional Bhd (11.76%) and Tan Sri Mokhzani Mahathir (10.18%). SapuraKencana\\u2019s asset base, which includes producing blocks such as PM323, PM318, PM329 and the AAKBNLP field, all off Kertih, and exploration assets such as SB310, 311 and 312 planned for 2016 and SK-318 off the coast of Miri slated for production at the tail end of 2018, and its drilling and pipelay assets could nudge banks into financing such a takeover. \\u00a0 Boustead Heavy Industries Corp Bhd Though not a pure oil and gas counter, BHIC does have a fabrication yard and builds offshore support vessels for the sector. Back in 2007, Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera (LTAT) and its units took over PSC Industries Bhd with much fanfare. There was so much hope for the company and it was the darling of investors back then. Today, Boustead Holdings Bhd, a unit of LTAT, controls 65% of BHIC. The army fund also owns an 8.16% direct stake in BHIC. This means LTAT and its unit control at least 73% of BHIC. Since October last year, BHIC\\u2019s shares have shed more than 36%. The stock hit its 52-week low of RM1.41 on June 24 and closed at RM1.56 last Tuesday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM387.6 million. In the first financial quarter ended March, BHIC suffered a net loss of RM19.04 million on sales of RM62.99 million. \\u00a0 Yinson Holdings Bhd Last Tuesday, Yinson\\u2019s shares surged 10 sen to close at RM2.88, giving it a market capitalisation of RM3.14 billion.

While there has been no real drop in Yinson\\u2019s share price \\u2014 down only 16% since September 2014 \\u2014 the argument for privatisation could stem from the current uncertain economic outlook. \\u00a0 The Lim family, headed by patriarch Lim Han Weng, has 33.57% equity interest in the company while Tan Sri Mokhzani Mahathir has 17.54%.\\u00a0 Collectively, the two hold 51.11% of Yinson. The other substantial shareholders include the EPF (10.53%) and AIA Bhd (7%). In its first financial quarter ended April 30, Yinson posted a net profit of RM22.38 million on revenue of RM211.38 million. Its net asset value per share stood at RM1.55. It is noteworthy that Mokhzani surfaced in Yinson in June 2014, forking out RM2.20 per share in a rights issue when crude oil prices were starting to slide.\\u00a0 Losing almost a third of their share prices has made most oil and gas companies attractive targets for privatisation. As market watchers say, as long as the world needs fossil fuel, \\u00a0well-managed oil and gas firms will remain attractive and some will regain their lost lustre.

In this report, we argue that in the long run, utility stocks with cheap valuations offer higher returns to investors than those with rich valuations. Our analyses show that the stocks with relatively cheaper valuations \\u2014 Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB), YTL Power International Bhd and Cypark Resources Bhd \\u2014 not only offer more favourable risk-reward, but also stronger long-term earnings growth prospects than Petronas Gas Bhd, Malakoff Corp Bhd and Gas Malaysia Bhd. Utility stocks under our coverage can be roughly divided into two camps. Firstly, those with earnings uncertainty or ambiguity, such as TNB, YTL Power and Cypark, trade at only nine to 16 times calendar year 2017 forecast (CY17F) price-earnings ratio (PER). Secondly, those with historically stable and predictable earnings, such as Petronas Gas, Malakoff and Gas Malaysia, trade at steep valuation levels of 17 to 24 times CY17F PER. Our analyses show that the valuations of stocks in the former camp will still be on par, if not cheaper, than those of stocks in the latter camp even if all the key earnings risks of the former materialise. This, coupled with the probability that the earnings risks may never happen, means that the former group offers far superior risk-reward than the latter. On top of that, TNB, YTL Power and Cypark have stronger earnings growth prospects than Petronas Gas, Malakoff and Gas Malaysia. Companies in the former camp, in our opinion, operate in an environment where there is an abundance of horizontal expansion opportunities. We believe cheap utility stocks could react more strongly to positive news than to negative news as positive news gives the market a reason to buy the stocks, while the impact of negative news is buffered by their already-cheap valuations. TNB remains our top pick for the sector as its valuation is not only relatively cheaper, it also has a strong potential near-term rerating catalyst. TNB currently trades at only 10.8 times CY17F PER and may raise its dividend payout as part of its initiative to optimise its capital structure. \\u2014 CIMB Research, July 13"}, "280": {"date_posted": "14/7/2016", "title": "No adverse impact from cessation of Berantai RSC", "article": " This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on July 14, 2016. \\u00a0 KUALA LUMPUR: SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd said it does not anticipate an adverse financial or operational impact arising from the mutual cessation of the Berantai risk service contract (RSC) with Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas).

On Monday, national oil company Petronas said it is taking back control of the development of the Berantai gas field, which is located off Terengganu, from UK oil services provider Petrofac Energy Developments Sdn Bhd and SapuraKencana after five years. Petronas said the cessation of the RSC contract will allow it to minimise the project\\u2019s long-term value erosion, and optimise development and production activities in Malaysia, in line with its efforts to reduce costs and increase the efficiency of its operations. With the cessation of the RSC, which will be effective on Sept 30, Petronas will reimburse all outstanding capex and opex to the contractors by June 2017.

Our forecasts are unchanged, pending the announcement of the group\\u2019s second quarter of FY17 results (2QFY17) in September this year, which will provide guidance on the group\\u2019s low asset utilisation levels. Recall that the group\\u2019s 1QFY17 results already reached our FY17 forecast net profit. SapuraKencana, with its partner Petrofac Energy Developments Sdn Bhd, has reached a mutual agreement with Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) for the cessation of the Berantai risk service contract (RSC), which was the first Malaysian RSC signed on Jan 31, 2011, with its first gas in October 2012. This is the second cessation of an RSC, the first being Dialog Group Bhd-RocOil\\u2019s Balai project earlier this year. The cessation of the RSC, which contributed RM100 million of group net profit in FY16, will be effective on Sept 30, 2016, which means that this project will continue to contribute as usual to SapuraKencana\\u2019s 2QFY17 earnings. As Petronas will reimburse all outstanding capital and operational expenditures to the contractors by June 2017, we do not expect any loss on this development. The ownership of Berantai floating, production, storage and offloading (FPSO) will be transferred to Petronas, which has announced that the cessation will minimise the project\\u2019s long-term value erosion, and optimise the development and production activities in Malaysia, in line with its efforts to reduce costs and increase the efficiency of its operations. In our opinion, the low-oil price regime has forced Petronas to redeploy its assets in a more clustered approach to tap the surrounding area\\u2019s network of shared resources. The Berantai development, which is a wellhead platform connected to Berantai FPSO while gas is exported by a 30km subsea pipeline to the Petronas Carigali-operated Angsi field, is located 150km off Terengganu, 10km south of the Tapis field and 30km north-east of the Angsi field. Recall that the project\\u2019s capital expenditure (capex) had reached US$1 billion (RM3.98 billion), of which FPSO accounted for half the cost. We understand that almost half of the capex has already been recovered over four years of the nine-year RSC. We are neutral on this development as the cash proceeds of up to RM1 billion (6% of the group\\u2019s net debt of RM16 billion) from the Berantai RSC can be redeployed into the group\\u2019s production sharing contracts (PSCs) off Sarawak. Recall that the group\\u2019s B15 Gas Field within the SK310 PSC area is earmarked for development with a cost of US$280 million, while a final investment decision is also likely to be reached on the larger SK408 block next year.

SapuraKencana announced in a bourse filing yesterday that the companies Petroliam Nasional Bhd and Petrofac Energy Developments Sdn Bhd have mutually terminated the Berantai gas contract with effective Sept 30 this year. Following the termination, Petronas will reimburse all outstanding capital and operational expenditures to the contractors by June 2017. Analysts are largely positive on the development, as they do not see any adverse impact on SapuraKencana. Commenting on this, AmInvestment Bank Bhd is maintaining its \"Hold\" call on the stock, citing the integrated oil and gas services provider may realise a cash proceeds of up to RM1 billion (6% of the group's net debt of RM16 billion), which it could redeploy into the group\\u2019s production sharing contracts (PSC) off Sarawak. The firm's oil and gas analyst Alex Goh noted SapuraKencana's B15 Gas Field within the SK310 PSC area is earmarked for development with a cost of US$280 million, while the larger SK408 block is also likely to reach final investment decision next year. \"The cessation of the risk service contract (RSC), which contributed RM100 million to group net profit in FY16, will be effective on Sept 30, which means that this project will continue to contribute as usual to SapuraKencana\\u2019s 2QFY17 earnings,\" he said. \"Our forecasts are unchanged pending the announcement of the group\\u2019s 2QFY17 in September this year, which will provide guidance on the group\\u2019s low asset utilisation levels,\" he said, adding that the group's 1QFY17 results have already reached its FY17 net profit forecast. His target price on SapuraKencana was RM1.40 per share based on FY17 book value, which includes a 50% discount on the group\\u2019s intangible asset value. Meanwhile, PublicInvest Research also viewed the cessation positively, considering questions on the economic viability of this development, given the sharply lower oil prices amid significantly higher operational costs with the involvement of floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO). \"As a matter of prudence, we had excluded contributions from the Berantai project in our initial earnings and valuation assumptions, given the very possibility of this happening,\" the firm said. PublicInvest thus continue to maintain its Outperform call on SapuraKencana, with unchanged target price of RM1.90, based on blended sum of parts (SOP) valuation. AllianceDBS Research retained its \"Fully Valued\" call with unchanged target price of RM1.20 on SapuraKencana, after the RSC contract termination. The firm's analyst Tan Jianyuan believed the negative sentiment impact of this news is mitigated by good progress made thus far, in terms of new gas discovery in the longer run. \"We expect the proceeds to be used towards paring down the group\\u2019s gearing to 1.15 times by FY18, from 1.27 times currently, with the projected annual interest cost savings amounting to RM45 million to RM50 million. We are also delighted to see its net gearing being pared down to more manageable levels,\" he added.

Meanwhile, Petrofac said it will use the cash proceeds for general corporate purposes. The company added that as a result of the cessation of the RSC and the FPSO transaction, it will incur a small impairment charge. On Jan 31, 2011, Petronas had awarded the RSC for its Berantai field to Petrofac to lead the development and production of petroleum from the Berantai field. It was the first RSC awarded by Petronas and had marked the start of development for the country\\u2019s marginal oil and gas (O&G) fields.

The Berantai partners were to develop the field and subsequently operate the field for a period of seven years after first gas production. When fully operational, the field was expected to produce about 150 million standard cu ft of gas per day (mmscfd) and 10,000 barrels of oil. In November 2012, Petronas announced that natural gas production from the Berantai field was successfully brought on stream on Oct 20, 2012. The gas is processed at the Berantai FPSO and exported to the existing onshore terminal at Kerteh. The full field development, excluding delivery of the FPSO, was anticipated to require capital investment of approximately US$800 million, of which Petrofac\\u2019s share was 50%.

As at April 30, 2016, SapuraKencana\\u2019s total borrowings stood at RM17.34 billion versus its cash and cash equivalents of RM2.34 billion. Its net-debt-to-equity ratio stood at 1.3 times for the financial year ended Jan 31, 2016 (FY16). An analyst who declined to be named said the cessation is positive to SapuraKencana\\u2019s balance sheet as the company could use the cash proceeds to pare down its debt. \\u201cUnder the current operating environment, cash conservation is very important for any company so that they can look out for new opportunities,\\u201d said the analyst, estimating that SapuraKencana may need another four years to recoup its investment in the Berantai field should the contract continue. Another analyst believed that the termination could be due to the low oil price environment. \\u201cBrownfield projects come at a higher production cost. At the current oil price of US$45 to US$50 per barrel, it is either the company did not make money or made razor thin profits from the oil being produced.\\u201d A third analyst said his FY17 earnings forecast for SapuraKencana has factored in the termination of the Berantai field as the management had indicated it during a recent results briefing. SapuraKencana slipped to a net loss of RM791.56 million for FY16 from RM1.43 billion in FY15, due to impairment provisions on O&G assets totalling RM1.14 billion and deposit on acquisition written off worth RM172.5 million."}, "284": {"date_posted": "11/7/2016", "title": "SapuraKencana says Berantai contract with Petronas to cease this September", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (July 11): SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd said its Berantai risk service contract (RSC) from Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) would ceased this September following a mutual agreement between the RSC owners and Petronas.

SKE is the operator of the Block SK310 PSC, which was awarded by Petronas on June 17, 2008 to NewField, which later sold its Malaysian upstream assets to SapuraKencana. Hence, SKE has a participating interest of 30%, Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd at 40%, and Mitsubishi Corporation\\u2019s Diamond Energy Sarawak Sdn Bhd at 30%.

The B15 development cost has been reduced by 24% from an earlier approved US$370 million (RM1.5 billion) to US$280 million due to optimisation of project engineering, execution and procurement. However, it will still comprise a central processing platform with a 35km gas evacuation pipeline to be tied into existing infrastructure. Recall that the B15 Gas Field will deliver 100 MMscfd (million standard cubic feet per day) of gas for five to six years to the Malaysia Liquefied Natural Gas complex in Bintulu, Sarawak, with first gas delivery targeted for the fourth quarter of 2017.

He says Icon will expand its operations regionally, become a market leader in the OSV space and even possibly expand into new asset classes to support the O&G segment. \\u201cDefinitely a regional play. It is never enough to look only at the home base,\\u201d he says. While Amir paints a pretty picture of the company\\u2019s prospects, Icon just announced its second consecutive quarterly loss late last month. It suffered a net loss of RM5 million on revenue of RM51.83 million for the quarter ended March. For the final quarter of FY2015, net losses were RM376.89 million on RM65.3 million in revenue. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0 As at end-March this year, Icon had RM35.85 million in cash. Its long-term debt amounted to RM501.47 million and short-term borrowings RM163.16 million. Its accumulated losses stood at RM188.09 million. \\u00a0\\u00a0 A saving grace for Icon could be its strong controlling shareholder. Ekuiti Nasional Bhd, the state-controlled private equity (PE) firm, controls 42.57% of Icon\\u2019s stock. Other substantial shareholders include Lembaga Tabung Haji with 8.43% equity interest. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 On whether or not the O&G industry has bottomed out, Amir says, \\u201cWell, I think there have been some good signs. When I joined the company in March, in the first quarter of the financial year, we saw the oil price at its lowest point of US$27 per barrel. By April, [oil was at] US$40 and now it is in the US$50s. The industry is reacting now, in the sense that, maybe the market has bottomed out a bit,\\u201d he says. Singing the same tune as Amir, Maybank Investment Bank\\u2019s T J Liaw says in a report on Icon late last month, \\u201cWe expect improved 2Q16 earnings on higher asset utilisation. The OSV market remains challenging but is in its trough. Icon aims to be resilient in such times and targets to be ahead in M&A activity, when opportunity arises. Its M&A prospect is a key standout, a rerating catalyst once it crystalises.\\u201d He has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call based on valuations and M&A perspectives, ahead of a cyclical recovery. And he says his target price of 42 sen is based on one times enterprise value over replacement value. In early May, Icon announced a RM42 million contract from ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Malaysia Inc for the supply of two straight supply vessels for two years with an option for a year-long extension. Liaw adds that with the two new contracts secured last month, Icon\\u2019s utilisation rate of its vessels in the second quarter of the year will be above the break-even 50%, and more than the 45% it reached in the first quarter. Maybank assumes an overall OSV utilisation rate of 53% for this year and 65% for 2017, which would indicate that the worst is over for Icon. While Icon may bag new jobs and increase its utilisation rate, daily charter rates of OSV\\u2019s remain depressed, which could continue to weigh on its earnings. Spot market and long-term charter rates have fallen considerably to US$1 to US$1.10 per bhp per day from US$1.20 a year ago. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 Nevertheless, Maybank forecasts that Icon will turn the corner and register a net profit of RM6.8 million for the current financial year, on the back of revenue of RM254.6 million. In FY2017 the bank-backed research outfit has Icon\\u2019s net profit pegged at RM27.4 million from RM327.1 million in sales. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 Interestingly, Liaw refers to Icon as an \\u201cM&A hotbed\\u201d and cites Amir\\u2019s association with Petroliam Nasional Bhd (where he had worked from 2000 until recently), the oil company\\u2019s call for consolidation and Ekuinas\\u2019 role as a PE investor, as among the factors for its positive outlook. \\u00a0 However, he says, \\u201cSize matters, after all, but it needs to be complemented with returns and profitability.\\u201d\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u2018We will build a brand new industry\\u2019 Amir Hamzah Azizan has been in the oil and gas (O&G) industry for 27 years. Earlier this year, he left Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) to become managing director of Icon Offshore Bhd, a company controlled by Ekuiti Nasional Bhd (Ekuinas). The move caught many by surprise. In a candid interview with The Edge, Amir explained the move and shares his views on the local O&G industry. Here are excerpts. \\u00a0 The Edge: Why did you join Icon? Amir Hamzah Azizan: To be fair, I was very comfortable and enjoying myself in Petronas, I was still in the midst of running the lubricant business. There\\u2019s never a time when someone thinks that he has reached a point and say, \\u2018I\\u2019m done, there\\u2019s nothing left for me to do here\\u2019, because there\\u2019s always something to do. And here comes Ekuinas, which says, would you now come and join us? The reality is that it (Icon) has potential. It is going to face a lot of headwinds because we have seen the oil price move the way it has ... what better time for you to shape the industry? \\u00a0 You talk about consolidation. Is there any mandate to consolidate the O&G industry, or is it your own direction for the company? When you talk about a mandate, what do we mean by that? Does it mean the government tells me, I direct you to do it? There\\u2019s no such thing. We will build a brand new industry for Malaysia and that\\u2019s an interesting proposition. Not saying that it\\u2019s easy \\u2026 it\\u2019s difficult, but I\\u2019ve got quite a supportive shareholder. \\u00a0 You hope for Icon to lead the consolidation. Do you see any room for entrepreneurs to be involved in running the company? \\u00a0 I think it\\u2019s possible. I don\\u2019t think organisations can run without some sense of entrepreneurship. The entrepreneurial spirit must be there. \\u00a0 Would consolidation entail Icon having the whole spectrum for offshore support vessel (OSV) services? I think today, consolidation play is very useful because most of the players are quite subscale at this point. Scale gives you the ability to have a wider range of vessels, more resources to introduce better systems and processes and all the good things that come with scale. But scale also creates challenges. You must be good in management \\u2026 a lot of moving parts. \\u00a0 Will Icon move from predominantly shallow water OSVs? It is within our scope to look at, but in order for me to make the next leap, I have got to be sure I can integrate and hold the process well. \\u00a0 Isn\\u2019t the recent increase in oil price to US$50 a dampener for the consolidation? Well, at US$50 oil, I don\\u2019t think anybody is rolling in money. So the logic for consolidation is still there because at the end of the day, instinct tells you that you have to get bigger because you need to be able to support the majors in a different playing field. When you had the majors all operating at US$100 oil, you had the rich man\\u2019s disease, right? When you\\u2019re rich, you drop a dollar, you drop fifty cents, you don\\u2019t pick it up \\u2026 you just walk away, it\\u2019s too much of a problem picking it up right? When you are a poor man, you will dig wherever you are, looking for pennies \\u2026 even in cracks. That\\u2019s where we are. I think everybody whom we have broached the idea to would like to consider it ... but I won\\u2019t say we are in detailed negotiations or anything of the like, but at least I have the alignment. No one has come back and told me it\\u2019s stupid (to consolidate). \\u00a0 So where does Petronas come in? It can create an environment to help. I\\u2019m not saying Petronas is going be asked to put in unreasonable catalysts. There\\u2019s enough competition to keep everybody honest. But at least for the people who combine and do something \\u2014 offer (them) a longer-term contract. That allows them to fund the business better and gives them stability. \\u00a0 What is your definition of scale? For the first phase, maybe call it the next two or three years, getting to a level of 50 to 80 ships. It will mean you have to have a base fleet here, but it will also offer you enough excess to play significantly in other regional markets that you want. \\u00a0 \\u00a0"}, "288": {"date_posted": "21/6/2016", "title": "Sanichi active, rises 3.57% on partnership to bid for Petronas jobs", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (June 21): Sanichi Technology Bhd rose as much as 0.5 sen or 3.57% to 14.5 sen after it partnered with licensed Petroliam Nasional Bhd's (Petronas) vendor Petrowangsa Sdn Bhd to jointly bid for Petronas' oil storage tank terminal contracts in the oil and gas industry in Malaysia and the region.

Market expectations for an interest rate hike dwindled ahead of the FOMC meeting amid a lacklustre May job report and concerns about a British exit from the European Union. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 34.65 points to 17,640.17, while the S&P 500 Index inched down 3.82 points to end at 2,071.5. The FBM KLCI plunged despite a narrower range of 20.8 points traded for the week with sluggish volumes of 1.46 billion to 1.56 billion dealt. The index fell 13.06 points and closed at 1,614.90 yesterday from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like British American Tobacco (M) Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Genting Bhd, MISC Bhd and Petronas Chemicals Bhd caused the index to fall on major selling activities. The ringgit was slightly weaker against the US dollar at 4.1000 as Brent crude declined to US$46.75 (RM191.68) per barrel.\\u00a0 The FBM KLCI rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (July 2014) and it represents an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cflat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cpseudo-bull\\u201d rise completed. The next few months\\u2019 index price movements since July 2014 comprised key swings of 1,671.82 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,503.68 (low), 1,727.41 (high), 1,600.92 (low) and 1,729.13 (high). The index managed to surpass the key 62% Fibonacci retracement (FR) level of 1,728.54 to a recent high of 1,729.13 on April 14, 2016. Very heavy liquidation at that level had caused the index to decline and move into a downward phase for its 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages (SMA) with a \\u201cDead Cross\\u201d on its short-term daily chart.\\u00a0 The index\\u2019s price bars are now below the 50-day and 200-day daily SMA and this depicts a downward phase for the FBM KLCI in the medium to longer term. Medium- to longer-term prospects look bleaker as the weekly 50-day and 200-day SMA have also issued a \\u201cDead Cross\\u201d in June 2016. Any bargain hunting on the index will be met by heavy longer-term selling on rallies.\\u00a0 The index\\u2019s daily signals are weaker, with all its Commodity Channel Index (CCI), Directional Movement Index (DMI), oscillator and stochastic depicting very obvious sell signals. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) remains positive for now. As such, the index\\u2019s weaker support levels are seen at 1,567, 1,595 and 1,600, while very heavy liquidation at the resistance areas of 1,614, 1,664 and 1,729 will cap the index\\u2019s rise.

The daily indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD and oscillator) have issued clear sell signals and now show firm and obvious indications of UEM Edgenta\\u2019s eventual plunge towards much lower levels.\\u00a0 It would attract very weak buying activities at the support levels of RM2.96, RM3.16 and RM3.22. We expect UEM Edgenta to witness very heavy activities at its resistance levels of RM3.27, RM3.56 and RM3.61. Its clear downside targets are located at RM2.87, RM2.26 and RM2.13.

Seacera Group Bhd has fixed the issue price for the third tranche of its private placement exercise at RM1 per share. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, the ceramic tiles manufacturer said the issue price of RM1 apiece represents a premium of approximately 9.89% to the five-day volume weighted average price (VWAP), including June 10, of 91 sen per piece. \"The payment from the placee is expected to be received within five market days from the price fixing date,\" it added.

This follows the disposal of 137.6 million BAuto shares in the same manner and price between April 14 and June 10, for RM288.96 million in total, cash. The disposal price of RM2.10 per share for BAuto was at a 7.89% discount to its current market price of RM2.28 per share. Meanwhile, pressured profit margin in its Malaysian subsidiaries due to intense competition, coupled with foreign exchange losses and higher vehicle costs here as the local currency depreciated against the Japanese yen, caused Berjaya Auto\\u2019s earnings in the fourth quarter ended April 30 (4QFY16) to slip by 6.6% to RM51.6 million. In comparison, the group posted a net profit of RM55.3 million in 4QFY15. The crimp in its earnings was, however, mitigated by improved results from its Philippines operation, which saw a 128% jump in pre-tax profit to RM15.3 million, from RM6.7 million, and lower group employee stock option scheme expense incurred (halved from RM1.6 million to RM800,000).

In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, Favelle Favco said CHOC is seeking the sum for the loss, cost of removal of a damaged crane and related costs of a temporary crane and replacement crane, as well as interest and legal costs, following the incident on a CHOC platform. Favelle Favco does not expect any financial and operational impact, because notwithstanding the outcome of the arbitration proceedings, FFCM is fully covered by insurance.

PETRONAS Chemicals Group Bhd (PetChem), which had a weak start to the year as first-quarter net profit slipped 2% from a year earlier, has no plans to slow down anytime soon. After putting its house in order over the last two years, the group is all set to ramp up capacity and feedstock supply reliability in order to increase its share of the market and fend off incoming competition, especially from the Middle East. Besides the Sabah Ammonia and Urea (Samur) plant in Sipitang, Sabah, which will provide an additional 1.2 million tonnes per year of granulated urea once commissioned by year-end, PetChem is spending US$2.7 billion (RM10.8 billion) to build four petrochemical plants in Pengerang, Johor. It currently produces 1.4 million tonnes of granulated urea a year. So far, the group has awarded four contracts worth a combined US$1.36 billion to two consortia to build the four polyethylene and glycol processing plants in the US$27 billion Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) project. But, considering the adverse conditions in the oil and gas (O&G) market, is it a good time to make such huge investment now? PetChem managing director and CEO Datuk Sazali Hamzah tells The Edge in an interview last Monday that the group\\u2019s investment in RAPID is not just another capacity expansion decision by the group. The project will not only make PetChem the largest producer of polyethylene and glycol in the region, but will also pave the way for a future without natural gas \\u2014 a commodity that is in critical shortage in the country. \\u201cWhy is RAPID a good project for us? First, our gas capacity is already at its peak. Gas supply [from Petronas] can only be sustained at our current capacity for the next 20 years. To grow our gas-based petrochemical productions, the supply would not be enough,\\u201d Sazali says. \\u201cWe can grow a little bit here and there, but not in a big way. Thus, we have to start using naphtha [as feedstock]. Naphtha is usually a by-product of oil refining. It can also be refined from coal, tar and shale oil. \\u201cAnd now is the best time for us to compete in the naphtha area as we still have the advantage of having big margins in our gas-based business.\\u201d\\u00a0 According to Sazali, about 30% of petrochemical players in the world are gas-based producers, with PetChem being one of the largest. It is worth noting that gas-based players, especially those subsidised by governments or quasi-government entities such as Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas), enjoy better margins than naphtha-based producers. While Malaysia is blessed with abundant natural gas reserves, most of the proven reserves have been \\u201cpledged\\u201d to North Asian countries on long-term contracts. Petronas has even ventured into British Columbia in Canada to secure gas supply for future requirements. Despite the depleting gas reserves, Petronas is still committed to supporting PetChem\\u2019s growth as a gas-based petrochemical producer. Sazali says the group recently finalised a new gas supply agreement with its parent company, Petronas, before the current 20-year contract expires this September. Apart from the ability to start a naphtha-based petrochemical plant, the investment in four plants in RAPID will increase PetChem\\u2019s capacity by half once they are up and running by late 2019 or early 2020, says Sazali. \\u201cWith the projects in RAPID, naphtha-based petrochemicals will constitute 30% of our production capacity. We would be much more robust than those players that are 100% naphtha-based producers, while on the gas-based side, nobody can be as big as us in this region,\\u201d says Sazali. The O&G industry has been facing one of the worst downward cycles in history over the last 2\\u00bd years, with crude oil prices plunging from above US$110 per barrel in June 2014 to US$28 per barrel in January this year. Last Friday, international Brent crude futures were trading at US$47.66 per barrel. While acknowledging that nobody can tell what the demand for petroleum and petrochemical products is going to be like over the next five years, Sazali says that, based on his past experience, there should be at least two upward cycles in the O&G industry over a 20-year period. For a petrochemical project, one upward cycle is enough to recover the initial capital outlay, says Sazali, speaking from his experience during the construction of the Kerteh Integrated Petrochemical Complex (KIPC) in Terengganu in the early 1990s. \\u201cIt was the same scenario during that time. I was involved in the development of the aromatics complex in KIPC. People were asking why we were spending RM2 billion \\u2014 a huge amount at that time \\u2014 on these two plants. \\u201cWhen we first ran the aromatics operation, the price was at the lowest margin. We built big plants with low margins but two years after that, the market picked up quickly. So, if we had not followed our discipline along the way back then, we would not be able to enjoy the benefits now,\\u201d says Sazali. He adds that demand for petrochemical products is growing, especially in a region where 50% of the population is forecast to reach middle income level by 2030. Today, Southeast Asia has a population of 620 million. To fulfil the growing demand for petroleum and petrochemical products, Sazali estimates that there is a need for eight integrated refinery and petrochemical complexes the size of RAPID in the region. To illustrate the high demand for petrochemical products in this region, Sazali says up to 70% of Samur\\u2019s capacity has been committed to customers so far, although demand for the products could take up the entire annual capacity of the plant. PetChem\\u2019s balance sheet is still healthy, with cash and cash equivalents of RM8.57 billion and only RM15 million in borrowings as at March 31 this year. The group generated RM891 million in cash from operations in the first quarter ended March 31 (1QFY2016). While the investments in RAPID will require PetChem to utilise its cash hoard and take up borrowings, Sazali assures that the group\\u2019s dividend payout policy of 50% of earnings will not be affected. In 1QFY2016, PetChem posted a lower net profit of RM592 million compared with RM605 million a year ago, while revenue slipped 0.2% to RM3.15 billion from RM3.14 billion previously. However, during the quarter, PetChem\\u2019s plant utilisation across the group reached its highest level since listing, at 92%, compared with 90% in 1QFY2015. Its olefins and derivatives business recorded plant utilisation of 97% during the period, while fertilisers and methanol was 89%. PetChem\\u2019s share price has been on a steady increase over the last one year, adding 7.7% over the period to RM6.45 last Thursday. Between Aug 24, 2015, and Jan 8, 2016, PetChem\\u2019s share price rose 40.3% to RM7.74. \\u00a0Last Friday, the counter closed at RM6.20, 16.7% off its 52-week peak. Analysts are quite bullish about the group\\u2019s prospects. Maybank Investment Bank Research has a target price of RM7.80 on PetChem over the next 12 months with a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call, while Kenanga Research has placed a fair value of RM7.30 per share on the stock. \\u00a0 \\u00a0"}, "295": {"date_posted": "1/6/2016", "title": "UMWOG bags drilling rig provision contract from Petronas", "article": " This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on June 1, 2016. \\u00a0 KUALA LUMPUR: UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd (UMWOG) unit UMW Offshore Drilling Sdn Bhd has received a conditional letter of award from Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd for the provision of a jack-up drilling rig for an undisclosed value. In a statement to the bourse, UMWOG said it will assign its UMW Naga 6 rig for the contract for a duration of two years. The contract also carries a one-year extension option. \\u201cUMW Naga 6 is a premium independent-leg cantilever jack-up rig that has a drilling depth capability of 30,000 feet (9,144m), and has a rated operating water depth of 375 feet,\\u201d said the group. It said the contract will contribute positively to the group\\u2019s earnings and net assets for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2016 (FY16). The winning came amid analysts\\u2019 bearish view of the stock, on concerns that the oil and gas services provider\\u2019s earnings may continue to be under pressure due to the weak demand for oil rigs and drilling service, coupled with the declining charter rates for jack-up rigs. This has prompted them to revise UMWOG\\u2019s full-year core net loss forecast for FY16 to FY18 by 35% to 84%, in anticipation of a lower average rig utilisation going forward. \\u201cIt is difficult for jack-up rig services provider to find employment for their rigs. Jack-up rigs are used for the exploration part of the oil and gas value chain, and exploration capital expenditure is the first to be cut in a sustained oil price bear market,\\u201d CIMB Research said in a note dated May 24. AllianceDBS Research shared the same sentiments, saying five out of eight of UMWOG\\u2019s drilling rigs are still idle. \\u201cIts average rigs utilisation rate fell from 95% in 2014 to 52% in 2015.

Although the share price of the petrol station operator has come off from its two-year high of RM25.54 of late, still it is looking expensive trading at a price-earnings ratio (PER) of nearly 27 times, compared to the FBM KLCI\\u2019s 15.96 times. Analysts and fund managers opine that Petronas-related stocks tend to carry a premium because of their stable business model and their status as syariah-compliant component stocks. Furthermore, the group is rather generous in dividend, paying out at least 74% of its profit over the past three years, to a large extent institutional funds would want the stock in their portfolio. But whether Petronas Dagangan will revisit its historical high of RM30 that it recorded in the first quarter of 2014 is a tricky question to answer as some quarters see that its business of selling petrol seems to be maturing. Phillip Capital Management Sdn Bhd chief investment officer Ang Kok Heng said Petronas Dagangan\\u2019s growth story previously came from expanding its petrol station market share by opening more stations. Last year, it finally overtook Shell Malaysia Ltd by having over 1,000 stations, versus the near-900 stations the rival had. \\u201cOf course Petronas Dagangan still has a long-term upside. It\\u2019s the medium-term outlook that is not as robust; the company is not expanding [its petrol station count] as aggressively anymore and the business has a strong correlation to economic growth, which as we know is expected to grow at a slower rate this year,\\u201d Ang told The Edge Financial Daily over the phone last Friday. A TA Securities note earlier this month said Petronas Dagangan had reduced its target of annual petrol station additions to a range of 20 to 30 this year. Before, its target was up to 40. The research house\\u2019s target price of RM18.55 on Petronas Dagangan is one of the lowest among eight analysts covering the group. However, that target price was based on 21 times projected earnings per share (EPS) for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2016 (FY16), when the stock has been trading at nearly 30 times. AllianceDBS Research, meanwhile, pegs Petronas Dagangan at 28 times its estimated PER, which analyst Inani Rozidin said is the five-year mean historical ratio. Kenanga Investment Bank, the only research house that gives Petronas Dagangan an \\u201coutperform\\u201d rating, has a target price of RM25.40, which is 27 times the projected EPS of 94 sen in FY17. Bloomberg data showed analysts project Petronas Dagangan to make a net RM873.7 million in FY16, 10.6% higher than last year\\u2019s RM789.98 million. On a per share basis, its FY16 earnings would be 88 sen. While the analysts\\u2019 average target price is RM22.10, if one were to use the historical five-year earnings valuation of 28 times earnings, Petronas Dagangan could be valued at RM24.64 per share. In the first financial quarter ended March 31, 2016, its net profit grew by 6.63% year-on-year to RM219.402 million. Its growth was stunted by a 6.2% drop in the commercial segment\\u2019s operating profit to RM133.62 million, as there was lower demand for diesel from Petronas\\u2019 exploration and production companies, and fishery sectors. The retail segment\\u2019s operating profit meanwhile was up by 12.28% to RM154.29 million, thanks to a healthy growth in its other income. AllianceDBS\\u2019 Inani, in her May 12 note, highlighted the risk of Petronas Dagangan making inventory losses if oil prices continue to drop. As the group holds one to two weeks\\u2019 worth of inventories and Malaysia\\u2019s petrol pumps adjust their prices only once a month, falling petrol prices in the future would lead to margin compression when they were purchased at higher prices previously. Another analyst said that crude oil prices stabilising currently at the US$45 (RM184)-to-US$50 level per barrel bodes well for Petronas Dagangan. \\u201cWhile the group is competing in a volume game, removing the oil price volatility will bring security to its margin,\\u201d said the analyst. Since April, spot Brent crude has gone up by 25.23% to US$49.59 a barrel last Thursday.

UMW Oil and Gas Corp Bhd (UMW O&G) posted a net loss of RM65.08 million in the first quarter ended March (1QFY16) compared to a net profit of RM32.15 million a year ago. The group told the bourse that its revenue more than halved to RM87.68 million from RM312.5 million. It said both its drilling services and oilfield services segments contributed lower revenue in 1QFY16 due to much lower levels of exploration, development and production activities in the oil and gas industry. Lafarge Malaysia Bhd's net profit fell nearly 72% to RM20.65 million in the first quarter ended March (1QFY16) from RM73.69 million a year ago, on lower contribution from its cement segment, following continued price competition. One-off Holcim integration costs also affected earnings, its bourse filing today showed. \"The higher share of loss in an associate, coupled with higher depreciation charges and higher finance cost arising from the borrowings raised late last year to fund the acquisition of Holcim Malaysia, also contributed to the group's lower profit before tax,\" it said. Its interest income of RM600,000 for the current quarter was also lower compared with RM1.9 million in the corresponding quarter last year, due to lesser amount of funds placed on short term deposits. Quarterly revenue, meanwhile, slipped 3.8% to RM669.78 million from RM696.09 million a year earlier, mainly attributed to lower sales contribution from its cement segment, due to stiff competition in the market and continued pricing pressures. JCY International Bhd has ceased the operation of its subsidiary in China, Foshan YK HDD Co Ltd, with immediate effect in view of the sluggish demand on hard disk drive (HDD). The integrated HDD component maker told the stock exchange in a filing today the global demand for HDD products continues to face a very challenging global economic environment. The integrated HDD component maker noted there will be an estimated one-time cost impact arising from fixed assets impairment and/or fixed assets written down of RM12.6 million, being 1.7% of its net assets as at Sept 30, 2015. Malakoff Corporation Bhd's net profit for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016 (1QFY16) fell 19.1% to RM84.1 million from RM103.9 million a year ago. The group told the exchange that this was mainly due to higher maintenance costs and share of losses from its associates and joint ventures, offset by lower forex losses and lower finance costs, following the redemption of the unrated Junior Sukuk Musharakah. Revenue slipped slightly to RM1.34 billion from RM1.35 billion in 1QFY15, following lower revenue from Port Dickson Power Bhd as its power purchase agreement (PPA) expired on Jan 21, while the PPA extension period started on March 1, offset by revenue contribution by Tanjung Bin Energy Sdn Bhd. TH Plantations Bhd slipped into the red to the tune of RM7.15 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016 (1QFY16). In comparison, it reported a net profit of RM6.58 million in 1QFY15. The group told Bursa Malaysia the loss was due to lower oil palm production on the back of dry weather brought on by the El Nino phenomenon, lower fair value recognition of forestry assets and a foreign currency translation loss from its Indonesian assets. This was despite the group's revenue for the period increasing 8.77% to RM89.52 million from RM82.3 million. British American Tobacco (Malaysia) Bhd (BAT) has appointed its North Asia area director Erik Stoel to assume the managing director (MD) post, effective June 1. Stoel, from the Netherlands, is to replace the group's former MD Stefano Clini who resigned on May 3 this year and will be returning to his home country Italy after concluding his international assignment here. According to the bourse filing, Stoel held numerous top brand marketing positions in the conglomerate in Korea, Ukraine, Dubai (UAE), Hong Kong, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Vietnam and Malaysia, over the past 20 years. Landmarks Bhd's net loss widened to RM6.59 million from RM1.54 million in the first quarter ended March (1QFY16), due to expenses incurred in the course of business commencement and start-ups. This is despite revenue for the quarter rising nearly 24% to RM23.92 million from RM19.3 million a year ago, attributed to performance of The Andaman, which recorded strong growth in operating results by RM2.52 million for the first three months of 2016. Tanjung Offshore Bhd's net loss widen by 138.1% to RM4.69 million in the first quarter ended March (1QFY16) from RM1.97 million a year ago, on lower revenue from its engineering packages and higher cost of sale and expenses. In a filing to the bourse today, Tanjung Offshore said its quarterly cost of sale went up 73.2% to RM11.14 million from a year ago, while its operating expenses expanded by 56.8% to RM5.48 million. Revenue, however, increased by 47.3% to RM11.99 million in 1QFY16 from RM8.14 million, mostly on contributions from its Operational Reliability and Integrity Gauging of Instrument based Safeguards (ORIGInS) contract secured from Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) in September 2014. Sunsuria Bhd has appointed Koong Wai Seng as its new chief executive officer (CEO), with effect from today. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Sunsuria said Koong, 49, who is currently the group's deputy CEO and executive director (ED) will be replacing Ho Hon Sang, who has resigned from the CEO's post to pursue other interests. Ho, 59, will be undertaking the advisory role to the founder and executive chairman of Sunsuria, Datuk Ter Leong Yap. Sunsuria also announced today that its net profit for the second quarter ended March 31, 2016 (2QFY16) more than doubled to RM3.15 million from RM1.47 million a year ago, due to a disposal gain. Revenue also more than doubled to RM38.82 million from RM17.07 million a year earlier as both its property and manufacturing segments posted better results compared to last year, the group said in a filing today. Rubberex Corp (M) Bhd's net profit grew 28.9% to RM3.6 million in its first quarter ended March 31, 2016 (1QFY16) from RM2.8 million last year, due to overall improvement in product mix and better production efficiencies. The group told the bourse that favourable foreign exchange rates of the group's trading currencies such as the US dollar and euro contributed to the improved results. Revenue came in 5.3% higher at RM74.5 million in 1QFY16 compared with RM70.7 million a year ago, it said. Rubberex also declared a first interim single tiered dividend of 1.5 sen per share of 50 sen each for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2016 (FY16), payable on July 28. The entitlement date falls on July 1. The Store Corp Bhd's net profit for the second quarter ended March 31, 2016 (2QFY16) fell 48.3% to RM4.24 million from RM8.13 million a year earlier due to lower sales. Its revenue for the quarter was 18.4% lower at RM386.78 million versus RM474.07 million in 2QFY15, dragged down by weak consumer sentiments, weakening ringgit as well as implementation of the goods and services tax and increasing cost of living. For the six-month period (1HFY16), its net profit was 46.33% lower at RM7.39 million as compared to RM13.77 million in 1HFY15 due to the same reason. Revenue retreated by 14.7% to RM745.47 million from RM874.43 million a year earlier. EG Industries Bhd has clinched a two-year contract worth US$36 million (RM146 million) from Swedish-based Shortcut Labs AB to be the sole manufacturer of a wireless smart button, known as Flic. EG Industries group CEO and ED Alex Kang said in a statement the contract has opened prospects for the group to support the fast-growing adoption of smart interconnecting devices, apart from affirming its proposition as a one-stop manufacturing partner. Chemical Company of Malaysia Bhd (CCM) slipped into the red after posting a net loss of RM250,000 for its first quarter ended March 31, 2016 (1QFY16) compared to a net profit of RM3.95 million in 1QFY15. This was dragged by lower revenue and trading margins, and higher loss from its discontinued fertiliser division. The group said in a bourse filing today that it registered a revenue of RM151.5 million for 1QFY16, which is 7.1% lower compared to RM163.1 million a year ago. Ho Hup Construction Company Bhd is revising its growth in profit after tax (PAT) downwards to between 15% and 20% in financial year ending Dec 31, 2016 (FY16), in view of the slowdown in the property market. Ho Hup initially targeted an increase of 20% to 25% in PAT in FY16. Ho Hup CEO Datuk Derek KL Wong said after the company's annual general meeting today, the group is readjusting the timing of property launches, and the management is cautious given the slowdown in the property market. The group also told the bourse today that its net profit for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016 (1QFY16) dropped 5.04% to RM19.08 million from RM20.09 million a year ago, due to additional financing cost incurred for corporate acquisitions as well as cost for funding new project developments. Revenue dropped 7.83% to RM81.08 million from RM87.96 million, due to no progress billings for the quarter pertaining to the joint development agreement with Pioneer Haven Sdn Bhd, in relation to the joint venture in Bukit Jalil City and Tower C joint venture with Gemilang Eramaju Sdn Bhd. Genting Plantation Bhd's net profit slumped 48.75% to RM26.99 million in the first quarter ended March 31, 2016 (1QFY16) from RM52.66 million a year ago, due to lower contributions from Malaysia's plantation and property businesses. According to the group's announcement to the bourse, the group's revenue fell 19.58% to RM260.87 million from RM324.4 million in 1QFY15. The group also noted its profit before tax in Plantation-Malaysia fell 28% to RM49.1 million, while property, slumped 62% to RM11.4 million. Pos Malaysia Bhd's net profit for its fourth quarter ended March 31, 2016 (4QFY16) fell 27.89% to RM14.35 million from RM19.9 million a year ago, mainly on higher transportation cost for its transhipment business, and higher recognition of expired postal order in the previous year's corresponding quarter. Quarterly revenue, however, rose 9.63% to RM433.64 million from RM395.54 million in 4QFY15. For the full year (FY16), Pos Malaysia's net profit halved to RM63.09 million from RM127.05 million, as profitability was affected by higher staff and transportation costs. Revenue, meanwhile, grew 14.95% to RM1.72 billion from RM1.49 billion, due to strong growth in its international and courier business. PRG Holdings Bhd posted a net profit of RM1.57 million or 1.07 sen per share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016 (1QYF16) driven by the profit recognition from Picasso Residence and progress billings on the progress of works from the construction contract in Ipoh. It had recorded a net loss of RM361,000 or 0.25 sen per share for 1QFY15. Revenue rose 15.7% to RM31.02 million from RM26.82 million a year. Axis Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) has proposed to acquire a warehouse facility in Pasir Gudang, Johor, for RM33 million cash. This will increase the total assets under the trust's management to RM2.19 billion. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Axis REIT Managers Sdn Bhd, the manager of the trust, said the trust will be acquiring the facility in the Pasir Gudang Industrial Area from Orientant Int Sdn Bhd. The property, located within Iskandar Malaysia, is a parcel of 2.51 acres of industrial land together with a single-storey warehouse building and other ancillary buildings erected on it. Progressive Impact Corp Bhd sank into the red with a net loss of RM2.79 million in its first quarter ended March 31, 2016 (1QFY16) from a net profit of RM2.49 million a year earlier, mainly due to loss incurred by Saudi operations and foreign exchange loss from its subsidiaries. This marked the second consecutive quarter it sank into the red. In the immediate preceding quarter, it registered a net loss of RM9.7 million on revenue of RM21.55 million. According to its bourse filing, its revenue for the quarter rose marginally by 0.65% to RM20.05 million from RM19.92 million a year earlier. Paramjit Singh Gill, a major shareholder of Multi Sports Holdings Ltd, has requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting to seek the appointment of five individuals to the company's board. The shoe sole maker said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia that Paramjit claimed he is the beneficial owner of not less than 10% of the paid-up capital of the company held through JF Apex Nominees (Tempatan) Sdn Bhd. He is seeking the appointment of Kasinathan Tulasi, Naren Anand Gill, Clarence Yeow Kong Chew, Cheh Chee Mun and Guan Swee Kee as directors of the company. Reach Energy Bhd planned to raise up to RM180 million via placement of new shares, to facilitate its qualifying acquisition (QA). In a bourse filing today, the company said it will issue up to 305.08 million new shares for the placement to raise the said amount, supposing 25% of its shareholders vote against the QA.

The index managed to surpass the key 62% Fibonacci retracement (FR) level of 1,728.54 to a recent high of 1,729.13 on April 14, 2014. Very heavy liquidation at that level had caused the index to decline and move into a downward phase for its 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages (SMA) with a \\u201cDead Cross\\u201d on its short-term daily chart. The index\\u2019s price bars are now below the 50-day and 200-day SMA, and this depicts a downward phase for the FBM KLCI in the medium to longer term. Medium- to longer-term prospects look bleaker as the weekly 50-day and 200-day SMA have also issued a \\u201cDead Cross\\u201d in November 2015. Any bargain hunting on the index will be met by heavy longer-term selling on rallies. The index\\u2019s daily signals are mainly negative, with its Commodity Channel Index (CCI), Directional Movement Index (DMI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and oscillator all depicting very obvious sell signals. As such, the index\\u2019s weaker support levels are seen at 1,595, 1,611 and 1,621, while very heavy liquidation at the resistance areas of 1,633, 1,700 and 1,729 will cap the index\\u2019s rise. The daily downside targets for the index are located at 1,569 and 1,527. All rebounds on the index to its 23%, 38%, 50% and 62% FR clusters of 1,637.77, 1,639.57, 1,653.76, 1,656.69, 1,666.69, 1,670.52, 1,679.62 and 1,684.35 would be met with very obvious longer-term selling and liquidation activities. Due to the very weak tone for the FBM KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201csell\\u201d on Naim Holdings Bhd . The company is into property development and investments, as well as construction and civil engineering works. It also manufactures and sells reinforced concrete piles, as well as provides earthwork contractor services. A check on the Bloomberg consensus reveals that three research houses cover this stock, with a \\u201cbuy\\u201d, a \\u201chold\\u201d and a \\u201csell\\u201d call each. Maybank Investment Bank Bhd does not cover Naim on a fundamental basis. Naim\\u2019s chart trend on the daily, weekly and and monthly time frames is firmly down. From a monthly Wave C high of RM4.51 (May 2013), its prices have plunged 56.3% on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames to a daily Wave 3 low of RM1.91 (May 2016). As prices broke above their recent key critical support levels of RM2.24 and RM2.42, look to sell Naim on any rallies to its resistance areas, as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term downtrends for this stock. The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD, oscillator and stochastic) have issued clear sell signals and now show firm and obvious indications of Naim\\u2019s eventual plunge towards much lower levels. It would attract very weak buying activities at the support levels of RM1.60, RM1.70, and RM1.91. We expect Naim to witness very heavy activities at its resistance levels of RM1.92, RM2.24 and RM2.42. Its clear downside targets are located at RM1.81, RM1.31, RM1.24, RM1.16 and RM0.83.

IT\\u2019S been slightly more than a year since Datuk Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin took the helm of state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) as its president and CEO \\u2014 and what a tumultuous time it has been. For starters, earlier this year, the company offered a rare separation scheme, \\u00a0reducing its staff count by 1,060, or about 2% of its 51,000 workforce. This comes against a backdrop of plummeting oil prices. International benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) \\u00a0hit a record high of more than US$145 per barrel in early July 2008 but plunged to a 13-year low of US$26.21 in February this year. Over the past 12 months, WTI has averaged only US$44.08. As a result, Petronas has scrapped several plans, such as the once-in-vogue enhanced oil recovery or EOR and the development of marginal oil fields. There have also been significant cuts in capital expenditure (capex) and operational expenditure (opex) of RM50 billion over the next four years, starting with RM15 billion to RM20 billion this year alone. \\u00a0 Earnings drag The oil company\\u2019s earnings for the year ended December 2015 took a beating as well. It recorded a revenue of RM247.66 billion, a 25% dip from 2014, and after-tax profits of RM20.86 billion, 56% lower than 2014. Petronas made provisions for impairments of \\u00a0close to RM17.7 billion in 2015, and RM23 billion in 2014, which added to the bleak financial performance. In an exclusive interview with The Edge, Wan Zul, in his candid manner, explains, \\u201cWe just want to be prudent, and of course when the price comes back, we can always write back.\\u201d\\u00a0 Asked about the downturn, he says, \\u201cI think it\\u2019s a real test for the whole industry. It\\u2019s a structural shift for the industry, and for Petronas, we are responding to the environment. What we do not want to do is to waste a crisis, so we are looking internally at how to improve and looking at how we can be more efficient. This has been the focus for the last few months. \\u201cThe psyche of the organisation is different at US$100 or US$110 oil than at US$30 or US$40 oil. At the current US$30 or US$40 oil, the psyche is that we have to be efficient and lean. It\\u2019s easier to get that kind of behaviour now than in an US$100 or US$110 oil situation. So, we are being tested in a very different way today. Our role here is also to prepare an organisation that can withstand the test of time in terms of all these challenges that we see and work on a new normal,\\u201d he goes on.\\u00a0 In a nutshell, while oil prices have dropped close to 60% over the past f ive years, crimping profits, Petronas still has to proceed with some of its larger investments, such as the RM53 billion Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) Project. Meanwhile, the US$36 billion (RM140 billion) Canadian liquefied natural gas (LNG) project and export terminal is still awaiting the final environmental certificate from the Canadian government.\\u00a0 The transformation of Petronas is hinged on Project Cactus, which aims to expedite cash generation and cost-efficiency initiatives and simplify procedures, among other things. For the longer term, the national oil corporation will spend a lot more time on the culture of the organisation. \\u201cThis is our strategic response to the whole crisis. We intend also to look at what we can do to make the Malaysian oil and gas industry more efficient, but this will be going forward, after we have all these internal things in place,\\u201d Wan Zul says. He seems to have his work cut out for him. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 Industry consolidation While Petronas has talked about consolidating the many oil and gas service providers, there has been little indication of how this will be done and when it will take place. Wan Zul says the oil company is presently undertaking a study and more clarity will come towards the end of the year. While not divulging any details, he says the \\u00a0intention is to make the whole industry more efficient. He highlights the requirement for companies to be registered with Petronas to win jobs, which could indicate that there will be higher barriers to entry for the sector. That may successfully force consolidation and weed out the weaker players, something that requires political will. At present, one of the notable mergers and acquisitions involves Dayang Enterprise Solutions Bhd taking over Perdana Petroleum Bhd. In May last year, Dayang launched a mandatory general offer (MGO) to acquire all the remaining shares and warrants of Perdana it didn\\u2019t already own at an offer price of RM1.55 per share and 84 sen per warrant, in a deal worth RM787 million. The MGO was triggered after Dayang upped its stake from 29.77% to 35.51% when it bought a 5.74% block from Affin Hwang Asset Management for RM66.6 million, or RM1.55 per share. While there has been talk of a controlling block in Bumi Armada Bhd, as well as a strategic stake in Perisai Petroleum Teknologi Bhd, being put up for sale, nothing significant has materialised. Wan Zul reiterates that there will be more clarity at year-end. \\u201cI do not want to pre-empt anything. We really need to do a lot of stock taking and [look at] what the options are, what is the least painful way, and how Petronas can play its role.\\u201d Some observers have pointed out that while Malaysia has 3,200 oil and gas companies, which are registered with Petronas, Norway just has 700 players in this sector, which would indicate that something has to be done. Open tenders have also been the norm, with the previous management of Petronas wanting the local companies to be more competitive. But this did not go down well with the players, many of which are politically linked. Groups such as Majlis Tindakan Ekonomi Melayu and Malay rights group Pertubuhan Pribumi Perkasa Malaysia have been especially vocal about this. Some companies, including TH Heavy Engineering Bhd, a fabricator controlled by pilgrim fund Lembaga Tabung Haji, have been badly hit by the open tenders. Even Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd \\u2014 an indirect subsidiary in which Petronas has a 66.5% stake \\u2014 has been affected. Wan Zul admits that there are huge tasks confronting him. \\u201cIt will be a challenge but I think we just have to give it a shot because that\\u2019s the right thing for the industry. We have to take it one day at a time.\\u201d\\u00a0 His predecessor, Tan Sri Shamsul Azhar Abbas, had come under fire in 2013 for similar attempts to make the industry more competitive and implement higher standards in the industry. Wan Zul is likely to know more about this than anyone else. While he appears confident and at ease, his struggle to change the way things are being done now won\\u2019t be easy.  No longer a lifelong employer A job with Petronas was once seen as a life-long career, but Wan Zul is out to change that notion. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t take your job for granted. If you don\\u2019t perform, there\\u2019s a chance you won\\u2019t have a job in this organisation. It must be merit-based; we place a lot of emphasis on meritocracy,\\u201d he says. Petronas\\u2019 recent layoffs came as a shock, but its review of staffing needs is likely to be an ongoing process. Retrenchments at other oil majors, such as Royal Dutch Shell, have been even more severe. Shell is letting go of some 10,300 of its 94,000-strong workforce. Oil and gas service provider Schlumberger is looking at retrenching 10,000 more employees. That would mean it has cut 34,000 jobs, or 26% of its \\u00a0workforce, since November 2014. Haliburton, meanwhile, is laying off 5,000 employees, or 8% of its workforce. Compared to these, the layoffs at Petronas do not seem that \\u00a0significant. But whether Wan Zul can further trim the workforce remains to be seen. His goal is to make Petronas more efficient and lean. \\u00a0 Potential minefields Some of the issues Wan Zul has raised are potential minefields, but it remains to be seen if he will actually get to see his plans through. One of his predecessors, Tan Sri Hassan Marican \\u2014 who was Petronas CEO and president from February 1995 until February 2010 \\u2014 had the support of then prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad to implement his vision. Industry insiders were aware at the time that irking Hassan meant irking the \\u00a0premier, which gave the Petronas chief a freer hand to run the company. \\u00a0 Shamsul replaced Hassan in February 2010 and continued until March 2015. He was 57 and had already retired when he was called to take over the reins. Some of his initiatives drew strong criticism from bumiputera business associations. So, how Wan Zul fares will likely depend on the support he gets from the government. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 There is also the question of how much dividends Petronas will be able to pay its sole shareholder \\u2014 the government. For the longest time, Petronas\\u2019 chiefs have had to grapple with balancing the need to re-invest some of its earnings for future profits and paying dividends to the government. Wan Zul, however, is unperturbed. \\u201cI think the shareholder understands [and] takes a long-term view. I don\\u2019t have much issue in discussing the quantum of dividends,\\u201d he says.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0"}, "301": {"date_posted": "13/5/2016", "title": "Petronas Dagangan posts 1QFY16 net profit of RM219.4m", "article": " This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on May 13, 2016. \\u00a0 Petronas Dagangan Bhd\n(May 12, RM22.72)Upgrade to outperform with a higher target price (TP) of RM25.40: We are upgrading Petronas Dagangan Bhd (PetDag) to \\u201coutperform\\u201d with a new TP of RM25.40 following its recent share price weakness.\\u00a0 First quarter of financial year 2016 (1QFY16) earnings threw no surprises with its bottom line normalised sequentially from margins compressed in the fourth quarter of 2015 (4Q15) on Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS) shock.\\u00a0 Going forward, with crude oil prices at year\\u2019s high with a more stable price movement, earnings shock is unlikely in the upcoming 2QFY16. All these should be good reasons enough to accumulate this index-linked stock. PetDag reported its 1QFY16 results, which came within expectations with a net profit of RM219.4 million, accounting for 26%/25% of house/street FY16 full-year estimates.\\u00a0 A 12 sen net dividend per share was declared for 1QFY16 (ex-date: May 24; payment date: June 8), which was lower than the 20 sen paid in 4QFY15, but the same as 1QFY15. Despite revenue sliding 18% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) to RM4.93 billion, 1QFY16 net profit surged 138% to RM219.4 million from RM92.1 million in 4QFY15, as the preceding quarter results were hit by a sharp decline for a brief period in MOPS prices as crude oil prices plunged 30% q-o-q back then.\\u00a0 In addition, 1QFY16 operating expenditure was lower by RM107.1 million on lower repair and maintenance, as well as lower staff costs. On the other hand, the decline in top line was mainly led by a 21% contraction in the overall average selling price (ASP), but sales volume increased. 1QFY16 net profit rose 7% year-on-year from RM205.8 million in the same quarter last year, which was mainly helped by other higher income by RM27 million, due to accounting reclassification arising from the goods and services tax, as well as a higher interest income.\\u00a0 Meanwhile, 1QFY16 revenue declined 19% from RM6.1 billion in 1QFY15, as the overall ASP fell 20% as MOPS decreased. This included a 12% dip in ASP for the retail segment and a 29% plunge in ASP for the commercial segment. If prices remain at their current high levels or trend higher for the remaining quarters, 2QFY16 ASP is likely to be stronger q-o-q, which may help to boost its top line.\\u00a0 Meanwhile, in view of the relatively stable movement of crude oil prices in contrast to the sharp decline during the brief period in the second half of 2014 and 4Q15, this could reduce the risk of earnings shock in the coming quarters. We keep our FY16 to FY18 estimates unchanged for now. With the rolling over of valuation base year to calendar year 2017 (CY17) from CY16, our new TP is now raised to RM25.40, based on -0.5 standard deviation (SD) three-year moving average price-earnings ratio (PER) of 27 times, from RM24.20 previously, which was pegged to -0.5SD three-year moving average PER of 28 times.\\u00a0 The share price of PetDag has fallen 11% since our last downgrade to \\u201cunderperform\\u201d three months ago.

However, Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd (PetChem) is cancelling the elastomer project in Rapid. The projected investment cost of the elastomer plant is approximately US$1.3 billion (RM5.07 billion) out of the total US$3.9 billion estimated for the total investment cost of its polymer, glycol and elastomer projects.\\u00a0 The other two projects (polymer and glycol) will continue according to schedule. The company noted that the cancellation of the elastomer project will result in 350,000 tonnes of capacity reduction per annum out of the total 3.5 million tonnes per annum. PetChem guided that the decision to cancel the elastomer project was arrived at after taking into consideration the less-than-favourable product market outlook and estimated return on investment of the project. In fact, the company further noted that the cancellation is expected to improve the overall returns of PetChem\\u2019s investments in Rapid. In light of the soft market outlook for certain petrochemical products and continued uncertainty in global crude oil prices, we believe PetChem is taking a very bold and prudent approach in its investment decisions. Nevertheless, PetChem remains committed to its other projects in Rapid, namely the polymer and glycol projects. Back in Nov 23, 2015, PetChem, via its unit PRPC Polymers Unit Sdn Bhd, awarded the consortium comprising Tecnimont SpA, Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corp, TechnimontHQC Sdn Bhd and TechnimontHQC S.C.A.R.L. an engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC) contract for a 900,000-tonne-per-annum polypropylene plant within Rapid worth US$482 million.\\u00a0 Also, back in Dec 4, 2015, PetChem awarded two EPCC projects (polyethylene and glycol) worth a collective US$882 million to the consortium of Samsung Engineering Co Ltd, Samsung C&T Corp and Samsung Engineering (M) Sdn Bhd. We are maintaining our \\u201cneutral\\u201d recommendation on PetChem with an unchanged TP of RM6.86 per share as we believe the outlook, fundamentals and stock price performance have improved significantly. Our TP is premised on a target financial year 2016 (FY16) price-earnings ratio (PER) of 17.5 times pegged to FY16 earnings per share of 39.2 sen. Our target PER is the company\\u2019s average quarterly rolling PER since its listing. It is, however, worthwhile to note that the company\\u2019s PER is a premium to its regional competitors\\u2019 average PER of only 14.5 times due to the company\\u2019s relatively cheaper and more reliable feedstock advantage from Petronas. \\u2014 MIDF Research, April 15"}, "309": {"date_posted": "15/4/2016", "title": "PetChem, RHBCap, XOX, BAuto, CMMT, CLIQ Energy, MRCB, Asia Knight, IHH Healthcare, MSM Malaysia, Emas Kiara and MNRB", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (April 14): Based on corporate announcements and news flow today, companies that will be in focus tomorrow (Friday, April 15) may include: Petronas Chemicals Group (PetChem), RHB Capital (RHBCap), XOX, Berjaya Auto (BAuto), CapitaLand Malaysia Mall Trust (CMMT), CLIQ Energy, MRCB, Asia Knight, IHH Healthcare, MSM Malaysia, Emas Kiara Industries and MNRB Holdings.\\u00a0\nPetronas Chemicals Group Bhd (PetChem) has cancelled a proposed elastomers project at the Refinery and Petrochemicals Integrated Development (Rapid) project in Johor.

Sapura Industrial Bhd saw its net profit for the fourth quarter ended Jan 31, 2016 (4QFY16) jump 232.65% to RM5.08 million from RM1.53 million a year ago. This follows a 12.09% rise in revenue to RM61.1 million from RM54.5 million in 4QFY15, the group said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia today. For the financial year ended Jan 31 (FY16), net profit dipped 6.44% to RM7.71 million from RM8.24 million in FY15, while revenue fell 3.6% to RM224.3 million from RM232.7 million. The drop in revenue was mainly due to lower domestic volume for certain models, said Sapura Industrial. Moving ahead, the group said the total industry volume for 2016 is projected at 650,000 motor vehicles amidst uncertain economic factors, which have led to a subdued business environment and moderation in consumers' spending. Crescendo Corp Bhd's net profit plunged 90.4% to RM3.3 million or 1.43 sen per share in the fourth financial quarter ended Jan 31, 2016 (4QFY16), from RM34.4 million or 15.12 sen per share a year earlier, due to lower property sales. Aside from lower property sales this year, the group said it had recorded a realised gain from the transfer of property development to investment properties, amounting to RM23.3 million, and a gain from fair value adjustment on investment properties, amounting to RM7.4 million in the previous year. Stripping out those gains, its profit before tax for 4QFY16 was 54% lower at RM7.6 million, as compared to RM16.5 million, it noted. Revenue for the quarter also weakened 18.8% to RM61.4 million, from RM75.6 million. The weaker performance notwithstanding, it is recommending a three sen final dividend, payable on Aug 29. Meanwhile, its annual FY16 net profit came in 85.1% lower at RM17.8 million or 7.81 sen per share, from RM119.7 million or 52.29 sen per share in FY15, due to the same reasons; while revenue slipped 27.6% to RM194.6 million, from RM268.9 million in FY15. Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd (MHB) announced that its managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) Datuk Abu Fitri Abdul Jalil will relinquish his position this April 30.

MHB is a 66.5%-owned subsidiary of MISC Bhd, which in turn is a 62.67%-owned unit of Petronas. \"In view of the current challenges in the O&G industry and pursuant to the group-wide transformation exercise being undertaken by Petronas, Abu Fitri has been called back into the service of Petronas,\" said MHB in its filing to the stock exchange.

Yinson Holdings Bhd saw its net profit drop 53% to RM47.43 million or 4.44 sen a share for the fourth financial quarter ended Jan 31, 2016 (4QFY16), from RM99.91 million or 10.51 sen a share a year ago, due to a gain on disposal in the preceding year. Revenue for the quarter was down 5% at RM241.07 million compared with RM253.62 million in 4QFY15. For the 12-month period to Jan 31, 2016 (FY16), net profit fell 10% to RM221.99 million or 20.8 sen a share from RM247.68 million or 26.06 sen a share a year ago, in line with a 10% decline in revenue to RM975.53 million in FY16 from RM1.083 billion in FY15. The integrated offshore production and support services provider told Bursa that its results were lower for FY16 due to the recognition of a gain on disposal of subsidiary and joint venture of RM20.87 million and a fair value gain of RM30.52 million in forward contracts in FY15. Excluding the gains, the group said its other operations segment saw an increase of RM17.23 million, which was attributed to net foreign exchange difference of about RM52 million, but was offset by impairment of available-for-sale financial assets of RM17.55 million and realised loss on derivatives of RM8.15 million. Sona Petroleum Bhd, which is in the midst of securing its qualifying asset, has adjourned its extraordinary general meeting (EGM) after shareholders said they were unclear about the company's proposed RM80 million capital repayment. The capital repayment hinges on the success of Sona's planned acquisition of the Stag Oilfield in Australia. After the EGM, Sona chairman Andre van Strijp said Sona would have another meeting within 30 days. Today's EGM was intended to get Sona shareholders' consent for the group's planned acquisition of the Stag Oilfield for US$25 million (about RM99 million). \"We have just finished our EGM and the decision is to adjourn the EGM. We will have another within one month. We hope to obtain support of shareholders for the QA (qualifying acquisition) in Australia (then),\" van Strijp told reporters. He said the adjournment was due a number of shareholders who were unclear about the possibility of Sona's capital repayment and complained that there were not enough details on the capital repayment. \"They requested for more information on the capital repayment before voting on the Stag Oilfield buy proposal,\" he said. Lay Hong Bhd has formed a joint venture (JV) with Tokyo-listed NH Foods Ltd (NHF) to expand meat-based business to the overseas market, such as Singapore and Japan. In a filing with Bursa today, Lay Hong said it entered into a JV agreement with NHF to leverage on the latter's research and development and manufacturing skill to expand to markets with huge potential. Lay Hong said the JV company would be named NHF Manufacturing (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, and will operate the business under the brand name 'Nippon Nutriplus'.

YKGI, which was responding to an unusual market activity (UMA) query by Bursa Malaysia, said apart from that, there are no other new developments that may account for the UMA. YKGI is involved in the manufacture and sale of galvanized and coated steel products. It has been in the red for the past seven consecutive quarters, since the second quarter ended June 30, 2014 (2QFY14). Annual net loss for FY15 narrowed to RM16.5 million, from RM26.64 million in FY14, mainly due to cheaper raw materials. Revenue was 8.6% weaker at RM491.63 million, from RM537.69 million in FY14, due to weaker market and lower demand of its products. Perdana Petroleum Bhd, which proposed the acquisition of two barges for US$84 million (RM330 million) last June, has decided to cancel its order for one of them due to the poor market conditions in the O&G industry. The company said it has so far not identified any potential charter contract for the barge, and will have to incur additional operating and finance costs for servicing the loan if it accepted the delivery of the vessel. \"This will put unnecessary strain on the group's balance sheet and cash flows especially if the vessel remains idle for a prolonged period,\" it said in its filing with Bursa today. Perdana Petroleum did not mention if it was reconsidering the acquisition of the second vessel as well. The company said it has written off RM36.1 million being the 20% deposit for the first vessel, in the financial statement for the year ended Dec 31, 2015. \"The board do not foresee any financial impact in 2016,\" it added. \\u00a0"}, "312": {"date_posted": "30/3/2016", "title": "Petronas' unit MHB announces change of guard", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (March 30): Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd (MHB) managing director and chief executive officer Datuk Abu Fitri Abdul Jalil will relinquish his position this April 30.

They were worried that Muhibbah Engineering\\u2019s earnings would be hard hit by the downturn in the O&G industry. Its share price halved from the peak of RM3.40 in July 2014 to a low of RM1.60. The stock revisited the trough in August last year when crude prices sank below US$50 per barrel. Nonetheless, the company has demonstrated its resilient earnings and ability to replenish its order book. Muhibbah Engineering has been able to keep its net profit at around RM80 million in the past three financial years. \\u00a0 Few may have expected Muhibbah Engineering to be among the key beneficiaries of the refinery and petrochemical integrated development (Rapid) \\u2014 a massive downstream project that Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) did not shelve despite the slash on capital expenditure (capex) by the national oil firm. \\u00a0 Currently, the company has an order book of RM2.35 billion, of which RM1.73 billion is from the construction division; RM694 million from the cranes division; and RM105 million from shipyards. This order book is expected to last two to three years, according to its financial director Shirleen Lee. Muhibbah has secured two contracts so far in 2016. Last year, Muhibbah Engineering secured about RM800 million to RM1 billion contracts, including jobs from Rapid. Lee foresees the company being able to bag contracts of similar values this year too. In short, its order book would continue to grow, so too would Muhibbah Engineering\\u2019s earnings.\\u00a0 She believes that securing contracts of RM800 million to RM1 billion is achievable this year. Lee opines that the construction industry is in its most buoyant time that one has seen in the last 20 years. \\u201cThe size of cakes is so huge, so all these capex will be the revenue for contractors,\\u201d she told The Edge Financial Daily. \\u00a0 Besides the ballooning order book, Muhibbah Engineering has a steady recurring income from its concession business, including airports in Cambodia. In other words, the rising tourist arrivals in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap would help to boost Muhibbah Engineering\\u2019s earnings.\\u00a0 Muhibbah owns a 21% effective stake in Cambodia Airports, which manages three international airports namely Phnom Penh, Siem Reap and Sihanoukville airports, in a consortium with Vinci SA, a French conglomerate.\\u00a0 Cambodia Airports derives its income from airport passenger tax, ground handing fee, rental of duty free shops and profit sharing, aircraft landing fees, and cargo handling fees.\\u00a0 The concession period for the three international airports is up to 2040. In financial year 2015 (FY15), total passengers for the three airports were 6.47 million, an increase by 13% from 5.73 million in FY14. Lee anticipates passengers to continue to grow by double digits this year, which will sustain the company\\u2019s earnings going forward. The passenger capacity of Phnom Penh and Siem Reap airports has doubled after the refurbishment works in 2015. Lee also pointed out that Muhibbah Engineering holds a 21% stake in Roadcare (M) Sdn Bhd, the company that has recently been granted a renewal by the Malaysian government of a 10-year concession for road maintenance jobs in several states.\\u00a0 \\u201cThis contributes about a few millions a year to our earnings. It fluctuates between RM5 million and RM10 million,\\u201d Lee said, adding that if the government requests to build new roads, then Roadcare will stand a chance to earn an extra income. Given the lesson learnt in the past on cost overruns, Muhibbah is more cautious about expanding its businesses, and sensitive in risk management. \\u201cCost overruns are just a part of the puzzle of the business. You have to continue sharpen your sword. The construction business is up and down. If you estimate it correctly, do it efficiently; you will make more. If you underestimate it, you make less,\\u201d she said. When asked if the group is facing cost overruns given the weakening ringgit, she said, \\u201csome are, and some are not, and some are better. Eventually, with a more diversified portfolio, it will be mitigated by each other.\\u201d She takes the reversing trend of the ringgit against the US dollar and oil prices recently as examples in mitigating risks. When oil prices [are] up, it augurs well for its crane business, but when oil prices fall, the group\\u2019s construction works would cushion the impact. About 60% of the group\\u2019s earnings are dominated by US dollars, Lee noted, and that this may change going forward, as Rapid may play a bigger role in the future. Lee sees this as a \\u201cbalancing strategy\\u201d that helps the group to mitigate potential risks. While Petronas is lowering its budget and cutting capex, Lee emphasised that the downsizing is for upstream, and that construction contracts are different from ship-chartered contracts as the charges are fixed according to the signed contracts. Muhibbah Engineering\\u2019s share price has rebounded from its recent low of RM1.60 for late-August.\\u00a0 A senior fund manager is of the view that Muhibbah Engineering\\u2019s valuation is not expensive at 10 times price-earnings ratio for the earnings forecas for FY16 and nine times for FY17. The fund manager highlighted that the concession businesses (airport and road maintenance) which contribute 20% of total profit before taxes provide a good cushion against \\u00a0any external shocks, while Cambodian airports concession is expected to register strong growth in the next few years following the recent extension works.\\u00a0 Alliance DBS Research analyst Chong Tjen-San projects a 23% increase in net profit for FY16. Muhibbah Engineering posted a net profit of RM85.58 million compared with RM81.55 million the year before.\\u00a0 \\u201cSo far 2015 construction margins are higher than 2014. I think their order book now comprises higher margin jobs. Going forward, \\u00a0as long as there are ample job flows and the raw material environment remains benign, I think margins should be stable,\\u201d Chong said. Besides, cash generating from Cambodian airports concession continues to deliver strong double- digit passenger arrivals, and will benefit from the recent expansion to 12 million passengers per year while its road maintenance division recently received an extension for another 10 years. Chong sees Petronas\\u2019 licence is a trump card that the company holds to compete effectively in the highly competitive and crowded civil engineering space.\\u00a0 Meanwhile, RHB Research O&G analyst Wan Mohd Zahidi said that the company has a track record of downstream O&G construction, having done work in Malaysia, Singapore and the Middle East. \\u201cMuhibbah is not a new kid on the block. I am sure it has experienced its fair share of difficulties in the industry and knows how to mitigate the slowdown in the industry. Having said that, I think being in the downstream segment of the O&G industry, Muhibbah is relatively sheltered from the difficulties being experienced by their upstream counterparts,\\u201d he added."}, "314": {"date_posted": "18/3/2016", "title": "Sapura Resources\\u2019 asset sale fails to excite investors", "article": " This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on March 18, 2016. \\u00a0 KUALA LUMPUR: The proposed divestment deal that is expected to earn Sapura Resources Bhd RM315 million cash, a sum bigger than its market capitalisation, has failed to lift its share price.  The stock opened on a strong note and soared to a four-month high of RM1.60 within 10 minutes after the opening bell. But the rally lost momentum later in the afternoon, Sapura Resources\\u2019 share price closed one sen lower at RM1.36 yesterday. Its trading volume swelled to 2.95 million shares \\u2014 the highest level since July 2014. Investors have shrugged off the proposed divestment mainly because a large portion of the cash received would be ploughed back to Sapura Resources for investment, which would have a gestation period before yielding any return. Sapura Resources would only distribute barely RM6.98 million in the form of special dividend to shareholders. This would translate into dividend per share of 3.6 sen. In short, earnings visibility isn\\u2019t clear while dividend payment is minimal, said a fund manager. To recap, Sapura Resources announced on Wednesday that it intends to sell off its education assets to Ilmu Education Group Sdn Bhd, the education arm of government-owned private equity firm Ekuiti Nasional Bhd, for RM246.99 million cash. Prior to the stake sale, there will be a proposed reorganisation, which will involve the disposal by APIIT to Ilmu of its entire interest in Asia Pacific Schools Sdn Bhd for RM138.8 million. Thereafter, APIIT will declare dividends, whereby Ilmu and Sapura Resources will be entitled to dividends of RM70.79 million and RM68.01 million respectively. The education assets comprise a 49% equity interest in APIIT Sdn Bhd, 49% stake in Asia Pacific University Sdn Bhd and 37.61% stake in Asia Pacific Institute of Information Technology Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. The remaining interest in these assets is already owned by Ilmu. Sapura Resources said it is disposing of its education assets as it is more value accretive to the group in the long run to use the funds from the disposal to concentrate on growing its property business, namely its Lot 91 Kuala Lumpur City Centre Development, as well as its aviation business. The company\\u2019s aviation service business at Subang Skypark and Senai International Airport remained loss-making as at Oct 31, 2015, while its property development joint venture is still in its infancy. The current slowdown in the property market does not draw keen interest in the group\\u2019s joint development of office tower and convention centre with KLCC Holdings Sdn Bhd in Jalan Kia Peng, a stone\\u2019s throw from Petronas Twin Towers. Furthermore, the stake in APIIT is the key earnings contributor to Sapura Resources. For the nine-month period ended Oct 31, 2015 (9MFY16), Sapura Resources\\u2019 aviation service business posted a pre-tax loss of close to RM2 million, while its property investment business contributed a profit before tax of RM8.74 million. On a net of tax basis, Sapura Resources was in the red in 9MFY16, with a net loss of RM548,000, compared to a net profit of RM20.1 million in the previous corresponding period. The earnings in the previous corresponding period were boosted by a RM14.3 million gain on investment from the purchase of a 50% stake in a 1.88-acre (0.76ha) parcel of commercial freehold land in Jalan Kia Peng."}, "315": {"date_posted": "15/3/2016", "title": "Alam Maritim rises 1.41% on RM54.2m Petronas job", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (March 15): Alam Maritim Resources Bhd shares rose 1.41% in early trade today after it bagged a RM54.2 million contract for the provision of workboat for Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd.

Top Glove Corp Bhd proposed to undertake the secondary listing of all the company's existing shares, which are listed in the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia, to the Main Board of the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX-ST) by way of introduction. Under the proposal, a shareholder holding Top Glove shares listed on Bursa Malaysia may transfer such shares to SGX-ST and vice versa for trading on the respective stock exchanges. The proposed secondary listing will not involve any issuance of new Top Glove shares. The transfer is subject to the fulfilment of transfer conditions and criteria, Top Glove told Bursa Malaysia today. Top Glove also intends to explore with its substantial shareholders the possibility of selling a portion of their shareholdings in the company of approximately S$20 million, or RM59.4 million, in value on the open market in Singapore. The glove maker said the proposal \"is expected to enhance Top Glove's investor reach and diversify its investor base as well as allow direct participation by investors in Singapore in the equity of Top Glove\". With the proposed secondary listing, it enables Top Glove to tap into a new platform for potential future fundraising as well as merger and acquisition exercises. \"It enhances the visibility of Top Glove's profile among international investors, analysts and media, thereby potentially resulting in stronger brand awareness for Top Glove,\" it said. The proposals are conditional upon approvals from the relevant authorities and the group's shareholders. Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd (FGV) said it is now deliberating on the change of its chief executive officer (CEO). The post is currently held by Datuk Mohd Emir Mavani Abdullah. \"The board of FGV will deliberate on the appointment/change of FGV CEO and will make the requisite announcement immediately upon the receipt of the nomination letter from the relevant authority,\" it said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia today. FGV had on Friday issued a statement, saying Emir will continue to serve as its CEO and president, after local media reported that he may be replaced next month. According to The Star newspaper, Emir, who was appointed to his current post on Jan 1, 2013, is expected to be replaced by Datuk Zakaria Arshad, the head of the group's downstream operations.

The group said the contract is expected to contribute positively to the future earnings of the group and its earnings per share. \"Any further renewal or extension of the contract's duration is at the government's discretion,\" it added. Hibiscus Petroleum Bhd plans to settle the US$5.4 million it owes Ping Petroleum Ltd via the issuance of up to 53.85 million new shares, which represent a 4.88% stake in Hibiscus. The sum it owes is the remainder of the US$6 million (RM24.68 million) introducer fee for its acquisition of the Anasuria Cluster oil and gas fields in Central North Sea in the UK. In a bourse filing today, Hibiscus said it had agreed to pay the introducer fee to Ping upon successful completion of the Anasuria Cluster acquisition as Ping had already achieved the preferred bidder status with the vendors prior to Hibiscus' entry into the transaction. The proposed settlement will be implemented in two tranches within six months from the date of approval by Bursa Malaysia. Meanwhile, Bumi Armada Bhd has filed a suit in Australia against Woodside Energy Julimar Pty Ltd over the termination of its Armada Claire floating production storage and offloading contract. It told stock exchange today that its unit Armada Balvanes Pte Ltd (ABPL) has filed its writ of summons in the Supreme Court of Western Australia. ABPL is seeking a declaration that the contract was repudiated by Woodside purporting to terminate the contract by issuing the notice of termination dated March 4 to ABPL. It is also seeking damages for alleged breach of contract over the repudiation, the amount of which will be quantified at a later stage, and an additional sum of US$66.19 million for work done and materials supplied pursuant to the contract. Protasco Bhd has received an extension of 10 years for the concession to do maintenance work for the Peninsular Federal Road, with most of the tenure's compensation to be on a performance-based contract. The construction firm said in its bourse filing that it had received a letter from the Malaysian government for the extension of concession for maintenance of the Peninsular Federal Road, good for 10 years. The interim period of two years from Feb 17 this year to Feb 16, 2018, Protasco said, keeps the same terms and conditions of the existing concession. But the remaining eight years of the concession, which shall end on Feb 16, 2026, will be based on the performance-based contract model. Ho Wah Genting Bhd's rights issue with free warrants was undersubscribed by 294.98 million shares or 49.07%, almost half the 601.15 million rights shares made available for subscription. The wires and cables manufacturer said as at the close of acceptance on March 9, total valid acceptances and valid excess applications received for its cash call was 306.17 million rights shares, together with 244.94 million warrants, representing a subscription of 50.93% of the rights shares. \"The valid acceptances received were 229.68 million shares or 38.21%, while the valid excess applications were 76.49 million shares or 12.72%,\" it added. In view of the fact that the rights shares with warrants have not been fully subscribed for, Ho Wah Genting said it will allot the shares with warrants to all successful applicants. It added that as the acceptances and excess applications received fall below the maximum issue size of 601.15 million rights shares, the issue size of the rights issue with warrants shall be based on 306.17 million rights shares and 244.84 million warrants, with fractional warrants disregarded. Bursa Malaysia has given more time to Asia Knight Bhd (A-Knight) to submit its regularisation plan. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, A-Knight said the stock exchange has granted it an extension time of up to June 30 to submit its regularisation. If it fails to do so, its shares would be suspended from trading and subsequently delisted from the stock exchange. The plastic parts manufacturer had earlier aborted a plan to venture into construction, as part of its Practice Note 17 (PN17) status. The company fell into PN17 status on Oct 31, 2014, following a disclaimer of opinion issued on its financial statement ended June 30, 2014. SMTrack Bhd has received an unusual market activity query from Bursa Malaysia for the sharp rise in trading volume of its shares today. The stock closed unchanged at nine sen, giving it a market capitalisation of RM28.78 million. Trading volume surged to 37.58 million shares as compared to last Friday's 456,000 shares. The group posted a net profit of RM720,000 in the third financial quarter ended Dec 31, 2015 (3QFY16) as compared to a loss of RM6.73 million in the previous corresponding quarter on higher revenue on more software solutions and related equipment supplies secured locally. It also attributed the better quarterly results to a gain on disposal of RM690,000 and an impairment of investment of RM4.99 million. Revenue increased 11 times to RM2.55 million in 3QFY16 from RM214,000 in 3QFY15. For the cumulative nine months (9MFY16), net loss narrowed to RM6.58 million from RM10.2 million a year ago, while revenue increased 71.07% to RM3.26 million from RM1.91 million in 9MFY15.

Energy stocks like Chevron Corp advanced after weekly supply data boosted speculation that a steeper-than-forecasted decline in gasoline supplies will lead to a drawdown in crude oil\\u2019s glut. The S&P 500 Index rose 10 points to 1,989.26, while the Dow gained 36.26 points to end at 17,000.36. In Malaysia, the FBM KLCI moved in a narrower range of 33.27 points for the week with higher volumes of 1.75 billion to 2.44 billion shares traded. The index closed at 1,690.91 yesterday, up 4.56 points from the previous day as blue chip stocks like Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd, Petronas Chemicals Bhd and UMW Holdings Bhd caused the index to surge on buying activities. The ringgit gained slightly against the US dollar at 4.0960 as Brent crude oil rose to US$39.80 (RM163.97) per barrel. The index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (July 2014) and it represents an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cflat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cpseudo-bull\\u201d rise completed. The next few months\\u2019 index price movements since July 2014 comprised key swings of 1,671.82 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,503.68 (low) and 1,727.41 (high). The index\\u2019s decline from 1,867.53 (April 2015) to 1,503.68 (August 2015) was in a perfect 1.62 ratio of the initial down-thrust from the high of 1,896.23 (July 2014) to the 1,671.82 low (December 2014). The subsequent rebound from the 1,503.68 low stalled at the 1,727.41 high, which is also a perfect upward 62% retracement of the 1,867.53 to 1,503.68 move. The index\\u2019s next two minor swings comprised a minor low of 1,622.84, which then stalled at the 1,706.25 minor high on Dec 30, 2015. Its persistent weaker price action in January 2016 was in tandem with the softer tone for global markets and the index troughed at 1,600.92 on Jan 21, 2016. The index\\u2019s next rebound from the 1,600.92 low surged to a new recent high of 1,710.20 on Monday. The index\\u2019s daily signals are mainly positive, with its Commodity Channel Index (CCI), Directional Movement Index (DMI), oscillator and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators showing chart buy signals. As such, the index\\u2019s firm support levels are seen at the 1,631, 1,676 and 1,690, while obvious profit-taking at the resistance areas of 1,710, 1,727 and 1,744 may cap any index rebound. The FBM KLCI\\u2019s 18-day and 40-day simple moving averages (SMA) depict an emerging trend for its short-term daily chart. The index\\u2019s price bars are finally above the 50-day and 200-day daily SMA, and this depicts a better upward phase for the FBM KLCI in the medium to longer term too. Due to the upbeat tone for the FBM KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Guinness Anchor Bhd (GAB). GAB produces, packages, markets and distributes beer. A check on the Bloomberg consensus reveals that nine research houses cover this stock, with nine \\u201cbuy\\u201d calls. Maybank Investment Bank Bhd\\u2019s analyst upgraded GAB recently to \\u201cbuy\\u201d with a discounted cash flow target price of RM15. Its six months financial year 2016 (6MFY16) results were above expectations on better-than-expected cost efficiencies, marginally lower tax rates and higher sales. GAB declared an interim dividend of 20 sen and a bumper special dividend of 30 sen to commemorate its 50th jubilee. GAB remains a defensive stock with an attractive dividend yield of 7.8% (FY16 estimate). GAB\\u2019s chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames are firmly up. From a weekly Wave-3 high of RM19.72, its major weekly Wave-4 low of RM11.35 was formed in October 2014. Since that RM11.35 low, GAB rose to its recent March 2016 high of RM14.80. As its price broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of RM13.01 and RM14.46, look to buy GAB on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term uptrends for this stock. The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD, oscillator and stochastic) have issued clear \\u201cbuy\\u201d signals and now show firm and obvious indications of GAB\\u2019s eventual rise to much higher levels. It would attract firm buying activities at the support levels of RM13.01, RM14.46 and RM14.66. We expect GAB to witness some mild profit-taking activities at its resistance levels of RM15.30, RM17.17 and RM19.72. Its clear upside targets are located at RM16.18, RM17.50 and RM21.45.

AWC Bhd hopes to earn total revenue of about RM555 million from the renewed 10-year concession awarded to the company to provide building maintenance support services for federal government buildings in southern Peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak. In addition, the company expects to earn RM145 million from a new 10-year contract to undertake the refurbishment of critical assets deployed in the federal government building. The building facilities management and engineering services provider told Bursa Malaysia today that its wholly-owned subsidiary Ambang Wira Sdn Bhd (AWSB) executed the privatisation agreement on March 7. AWSB had been handling the management, maintenance, upkeep, and support services for the federal government buildings for the Southern Zone covering the states of Malacca, Negeri Sembilan and Johor, and Sarawak Zone, since June 1998. Nexgram Holdings Bhd said its investigation committee has appointed Ferrier Hodgson MH Sdn Bhd as the special auditor to carry out independent verification over certain assets within Nexgram Group, such as cash and bank balances, and pre-development costs. The special audit is expected to be completed within eight to 10 weeks, the information technology services provider said. The special committee was formed on Jan 22, following inconsistencies found with regards to details of certain assets within the Nexgram Group. The committee comprised its executive director Chen Chuen Sum, as well as three non-executive directors, namely Fu Lit Fung, Helmi Faisal bin Fuad and Zaharin Ahmad Zamani. Carimin Petroleum Bhd has bagged a contract from Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd to provide mechanical services. The group, via its wholly-owned subsidiary Carimin Engineering Services Sdn Bhd, was awarded the contract on Feb 24. The project will be for two years from March 2 this year to March 1, 2018, with an option to extend for another year. The contract is on a call out basis with Petronas Carigali issuing the release order as and when there are requirements to perform the service. As such, Carimin said the contract value was not disclosed as the total value of the scope of work will depend on the duration of the services and cost related to the project management, mechanical services, materials and other related services. TSR Capital Bhd's wholly-owned subsidiary TSR Bina Sdn Bhd has bagged construction jobs worth RM268.9 million from Kwasa Land Sdn Bhd. The group accepted the letter of award (LoA) from Kwasa Land for the construction and completion of common infrastructure works for work package contracts WPC1B and WPC1C at the Kwasa Damansara Township Development in Sungai Buloh, Selangor. The project is for a period of 104 weeks and is expected to be completed by March 12, 2018. PBA Holdings Bhd is expected to pay about RM61.5 million as water intake fee for a three-year period, effective this year. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, PBA said it received a letter from the Penang government on Feb 26, saying the water intake fee is revised from three sen to six sen per cubic metre, based on the actual production volume from 2016 to 2018. The water intake fee is regarded as recurrent related party transaction (RRPT) pursuant to the Listing Requirements by virtue of the substantial shareholdings held by the state government through the State Secretary Inc, Penang (SSI) in the company, and the relationship between the state government and SSI,\" the filing said. \"SSI is a major shareholder of the company, holding 55% of the total issued and paid-up capital of the company as at Dec 31, 2015. \"The RRPT involves the payment of annual water intake fee to Penang, of which SSI is deemed to have an interest,\" said PBA. Gadang Holdings Bhd is proposing to undertake a private placement exercise in order to raise funds for the expansion of its property development business, which it expects will contribute positively to the group's future profitability. The group said the expansion activities for its property development segment may include potential acquisition of additional viable land banks, and property development and investment projects. The private placement will entail the issuance of up to 23.51 million shares or 10% of its issued and paid-up capital, the company said. The placement share will not be priced at more than 10% discount to the five-day volume weighted average market price of Gadang's share prices, immediately before the price fixing date. Assuming an indicative issue price of RM1.88 per share, the proposed private placement is expected to raise gross proceeds of up to RM44.2 million. Damansara Realty Bhd has bagged a cleaning contract at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) worth RM35 million, excluding goods and services tax. The property developer said its subsidiary TMR Urusharta (M) Sdn Bhd won the comprehensive cleaning and related services contract from Malaysia Airports (Sepang) Sdn Bhd. It is for a three-year period from April this year to March 2019, with an option to extend for a further two years, on the same terms and conditions. Reach Energy Bhd is acquiring a 60% stake in Kazakhstan's Emir-Oil Fields for US$154.9 million (RM638.2 million). Emir will be Reach Energy's first hydrocarbon asset. The special purpose acquisition company said it was buying a 60% stake in Netherlands-based Palaeontol BV, which owns 100% of Emir. Palaeontol BV is wholly owned by Palaeontol Cooperatief UA, which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hong Kong-listed MIE Holdings Corp. Reach Energy said that since the producing fields within the Emir-Oil Fields are already in production and with established infrastructure of gas pipeline, gas processing plant, oil processing, oil storage and transportation facilities in place, the proposed acquisition is expected to immediately contribute positively to its revenue. CLIQ Energy Bhd said it has received numerous offers to undertake its liquidation and is currently in the process of shortlisting the liquidator. The company will make an announcement once the liquidator is decided, it said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia. To recap, the second oil and gas special purpose acquisition company listed on Bursa announced on Feb 24 that it will be liquidated after the Securities Commission Malaysia declined its request for more time to acquire its qualifying asset. Encorp Bhd has been awarded a RM8.9 million contract by MSM Sugar Refinery (Johor) Sdn Bhd in relation to the proposed construction of a sugar refinery in Johor Bahru. The group said its subsidiary Encorp Construction & Infrastructure Sdn Bhd received the LoA on March 4, and the contract period is from that date to Aug 3. \"Encorp Construction will be appointed as the main contractor for the construction works; the scope of works shall include construction and completion of earthworks and temporary site facilities for the project,\" said Encorp. The awarded contract is deemed a related party transaction, as both companies have ties to the Federal Land Development Authority (Felda). Len Cheong Holding Bhd said it is unaware of any reason for the recent sharp rise in price and volume of its shares. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Len Cheong said after having made due enquiries with the directors, major shareholders and such other relevant persons, it is not aware of any corporate development relating to the group's businesses and affairs, which has not been previously announced, that may account for the unusual market activity.

Note that FY15 earnings have been adjusted to exclude a fair value gain of RM109 million due to a remeasurement of the equity interest held in Perdana Petroleum Bhd on July 24, 2015. Disappointing FY15 numbers were hammered by losses incurred by its subsidiary Perdana Petroleum in FY15. Dayang\\u2019s core profit before tax (PBT) margin was lower at 12% in FY15 against FY14\\u2019s margin of 22%. \\u00a0 No dividend was declared during the quarter.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Dayang\\u2019s FY15 revenue was down to RM779 million (-11% y-o-y) mainly impacted by a lower contribution from the offshore top marine services segment, which posted a weaker revenue of RM704 million (-18% y-o-y) due to lower work order value during the period. Similarly, Dayang\\u2019s FY15 core PBT also slipped by 49% y-o-y to RM99 million impacted by the lower earnings contribution from Perdana Petroleum, which suffered a loss of RM77 million in the fourth quarter of FY15 due to the challenging offshore supply vessel business in tandem with the drop in oil prices.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 We remain upbeat on Dayang\\u2019s long-term outlook driven by the group\\u2019s sizeable order book of approximately RM3.8 billion as at December 2015, which is expected to last the group until FY18. Note that the majority of its order book is derived from three hook-up and commissioning (HUC) jobs secured in May 2013. Recall that Dayang won a new contract worth RM250 million in June 2015, awarded by Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd for the provision of facilities improvement projects for Petronas Carigali\\u2019s Package A: Sarawak Operations and Sabah Operations Offshore. The group\\u2019s outstanding tender book stood at approximately RM350 million as at December 2015. We are positive on its latest takeover of Perdana Petroleum, which would further strengthen Dayang\\u2019s business expansion, especially on the HUC services by leveraging on Perdana Petroleum\\u2019s expertise as a marine player with a fleet size of 17 vessels (eight anchor handling tugs and supply, seven work barges and two workboats). Furthermore, it would be a strong selling point for Dayang in bidding for new tenders.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 We have done some housekeeping exercise, and come out with new FY16 and FY17 earnings forecasts of RM115 million (+83% y-o-y) and RM159 million (+38% y-o-y) respectively. We expect the group to face a challenging period in FY16 on weaker-than-expected work orders for HUC jobs in line with the softening in oil prices, but FY17 earnings are expected to stabilise as we factor in higher contract wins with an expected rebound in oil price movements. Nonetheless, there is a stress point for Dayang following Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u2019s decision to cut capital expenditure by RM15 billion in 2016. This, like it or not, may affect marine players as the renegotiation of contracts could be on the plate. There could be some short- to medium-term negative sentiment for oil and gas players, especially when the protracted weakness in oil prices has yet to see light at the end of the tunnel.\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0 We revalue Dayang at RM1.26, based on seven times price-earnings ratio (PER) (45% discount to average three-year low PER of 13 times) pegged to FY17 earnings per share of 18 sen and the stock is a \\u201chold\\u201d underpinned by i) slower-than-expected order book replenishment; and ii) weaker HUC\\u2019s margin. \\u2014 M&A Securities, March 1"}, "320": {"date_posted": "4/3/2016", "title": "Petra Energy bucks the trend", "article": " This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on February 15 - 21, 2016. \\u00a0 The recent news that oil and gas major Dialog Group Bhd mutually terminated its small field risk service contract with Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) has sparked concerns about the viability of the other RSCs with local oil and gas players. Shareholders of Petra Energy Bhd, which is also one of the RSC recipients, however, should have little to worry about. A brief look at the company\\u2019s earnings in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015, would be enough to tell that Petra Energy has already recovered the capital expenditure incurred for the RSC, given that it posted its first profit of RM15.1 million with contributions from its 30% associate company, Coastal Energy KBM Sdn Bhd (CEKBM). \\u201cThis suggests [that CEKBM] has recouped all its capital costs, and the remuneration fee has started to kick in in 3Q2015, which was earlier than what management had [initially] guided. Therefore, future allocated revenue \\u2014 70% of KBM cluster field\\u2019s revenue \\u2014 will only be used to cover the operating cost, with the remaining sums available to be used to pay remuneration fees to CEKBM,\\u201d states Affin Hwang Capital in a Jan 20 research report. Petra Energy has a 30:70 joint venture with an oil and gas company with assets in Thailand \\u2014 Coastal Energy Co \\u2014 operating the Kapal, Beranang and Meranti (KBM) cluster under the RSC, which achieved first oil in December 2013 and is currently producing 13,000 barrels per day. Reports have indicated that the KBM cluster is estimated to contain recoverable resources of 15 million to 35 million barrels. It is understood that its cumulative production is approaching 10 million barrels. It is noteworthy that the small field RSC for the KBM cluster is for eight years, commencing June 2012. Market experts say the estimated production cost at KBM is US$20 per barrel, which indicates that it is still profitable for the joint venture to continue production despite the depressed crude oil prices. Last Thursday, Brent crude traded at US$30.83 per barrel. At its peak in July 2008, the crude oil price was at US$145 per barrel. Nevertheless, Petra Energy\\u2019s success in the oil production and development segment is only one aspect of it bucking the trend. Petra Energy\\u2019s net profit for the nine months ended Sept 30, 2015 (9MFY15), increased 32.3% to RM36.89 million from a year ago. Revenue rose to RM449.65 million from RM417 million previously. The higher profit was aided by increased contributions from its RSC project and marine assets segment. Petra Energy\\u2019s marine assets segment registered a profit of RM7.23 million for 9MFY2015, compared with a loss of RM4.84 million previously. This, says the company in its results notes, was due to the higher utilisation rate of its vessels. Currently, the utilisation rate of its vessels is about 50%. Market experts say the segment will continue to be profitable as long as the company is able to keep the utilisation rate at above 40%. Petra Energy\\u2019s services segment saw a decline in revenue and profit in the third quarter due to unrealised foreign exchange losses from its US dollar-denominated borrowings. However, the segment\\u2019s 9MFY2015 profit was higher, at RM23.93 million, compared with RM21.49 million previously. This was due to higher contributions from the hook up, commissioning and top-side major maintenance (HuC and TMM) contract from Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd (PCSB), says the company in its notes. According to Affin Hwang Capital\\u2019s estimates, Petra Energy has realised only RM880 million worth of orders out of the RM2.5 billion contract from PCSB. The contract was awarded on May 21, 2013, for the provision of HuC and TMM services in offshore Sabah and Sarawak for five years. \\u201cThis (the remaining RM1.62 billion worth of orders) is sufficient to tide the segment over through 2018, even if Petra Energy fails to win any new contracts,\\u201d says the research house. However, the research house also highlights that there could be a risk that the RM2.5 billion contract may be deferred due to depressed crude oil prices. \\u201cWe see limited risks in the pan-Malaysian order book under normal circumstances as maintenance activities for ageing brownfield facilities are a prerequisite for PCSB to sustain oil production at an optimal level. But, we cannot be so sure now, given the recent plunge in crude oil prices to below US$29 per barrel,\\u201d it says. That said, Petra Energy\\u2019s balance sheet looks healthy with its net gearing ratio at only 0.38 times as at Sept 30, 2015 \\u2014 one of the lowest in the industry \\u2014 which will place it in a better position than its peers in withstanding industry headwinds. It is worth noting that all three research houses covering Petra Energy have \\u201cbuy\\u201d calls on the stock with an average 12-month target price of RM1.62. Petra Energy\\u2019s net asset per share of RM1.73 as at Sept 30, 2015, is also 51.75% higher than its last Thursday\\u2019s closing share price of RM1.14, translating into a market capitalisation of RM365.88 million.

Pandan MP Rafizi Ramli said losses sustained through Tabung Haji's investment in Tabung Haji Heavy Engineering (THHE) could one day affect the amount of dividends to its depositors and its ability to subsidise pilgrimages. Rafizi said Tabung Haji had poured RM1.4 billion in risky investments into THHE, an oil and gas engineering firm formerly known as Ramunia Holdings Berhad, between 2008 and 2015. A large portion of that RM1.4 billion, totalling RM981 million, is in the form of a corporate guarantee from Tabung Haji to THHE. This financial aid had been declared high risk even by Tabung Haji's investment risk panel, Rafizi said. The RM981 million corporate guarantee was given even though it breached the Tabung Haji Act of 1995, which states that financial assistance may only be given to a subsidiary of the pilgrims' fund,\\u00a0 Rafizi added. According to documents leaked to PKR, the RM981 million had also been approved by the Finance Ministry, Rafizi said. Tabung Haji has 8.85 million active depositors, all of whom are Malaysian Muslims saving up money with the fund to perform the haj. Of the remainder of the RM1.4 billion which Tabung Haji could lose, RM100 million could also come from the fall in share prices of Ramunia Holdings Berhad, which the pilgrims' fund had bought in 2008. It also includes RM275 million in Islamic irredeemable cumulative preference shares (ICPS) issued by THHE and bought by Tabung Haji after they were not well received by investors, Rafizi said. Tabung Haji had also bought RM50 million worth of sukuk bonds issued by THHE in 2010. Added to the RM981 million, these individual investments totalled RM1.4 billion in potential loss, Rafizi said. Tabung Haji's interest in THHE began in 2008 when it was still Ramunia, an engineering firm whose share prices had shot up due to rumours that it would be bought by a subsidiary of national oil giant Petronas. \"This was also at a time when oil prices were above US$100 per barrel and if the rumours were true, Ramunia would be getting a lot of jobs from Petronas,\" Rafizi said. In 2009 however, Ramunia ran into financial troubles and was unable to pay its contractors, causing it to be sued. In 2010, its share prices plunged from a high of RM1.95 in 2008 to 20.5 sen. Further trading of its shares was suspended from the stock market. Yet Tabung Haji continued to invest in Ramunia and in 2010, when it was rebranded to THHE, became its biggest share holder. Tabung Haji then bought up RM275 million in ICPS from THHE. In late 2015, it approved RM981 million in corporate guarantees even though the latter\\u2019s performance was worrying, Rafizi said. \"The question is how can Tabung Haji assure its depositors that this was a worthwhile investment and that THHE can get back on its feet in the next five to eight years at a time when the oil and gas industry has been badly hit?\" This is since THHE is dependent on work in the oil and gas industry at a time when many companies are shedding staff and cutting back on projects due to the low oil price. Rafizi was also sceptical of THHE\\u2019s ability as the firm had still run into financial trouble in 2008 and 2009 when oil was above US$100."}, "324": {"date_posted": "24/2/2016", "title": "PetGas' 4Q profit falls 27.4% on lower JV profit, higher costs", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 24): Petronas Gas Bhd (PetGas) reported a 27.44% drop in its net profit in its final quarter of financial year ended Dec 31, 2015 (4QFY15) to RM414.5 million or 20.95 sen per share, mainly due to lower share of profit from joint ventures, attributable to recognition of deferred tax assets (DTA) on investment tax allowance (ITA) granted for the Kimanis Power Plant in the corresponding quarter.

Higher operating costs, driven by its focus to improve asset integrity under PetGas\\u2019 transformation initiatives, also impacted the group\\u2019s latest quarterly earnings, according to its bourse filing today. \\u201cThese were partially offset by unrealised forex gain on finance lease liabilities due to strengthening of the ringgit against US dollar during the quarter,\\u201d it added. Revenue for 4QFY15 came in at RM1.14 billion, which was 2.26% higher than the previous corresponding quarter\\u2019s RM1.11 billion.

Yesterday, the company announced a net loss of RM409.13 million in 4QFY15, versus a net profit of RM71.95 million in the previous year's corresponding quarter, on the back of a 60% contraction in revenue to RM130.96 million. Impairment losses and shrinking business activities were largely to blame for the massive quarterly net loss. The loss for the quarter translated to an annual net loss of RM372.31 million for the financial year ended Dec 31 (FY15), from a net profit of RM252 million a year earlier. Following the lower-than-expected results, CIMB Investment Bank Bhd today maintained its \"reduce\" call on the stock, with a target price (TP) of 38 sen.

The oilfield services also reported a pre-tax loss of RM8.4 million for the quarter, from a profit of RM3 million in the previous year. \"The low crude oil price has caused a halt in the bulk of exploring activities, which led to a lower level of activities in the development stage, where UMW-OG's drilling rigs services are utilised. \"We believe 2016 will be another challenging year for UMW-OG to secure new contracts for all of its drilling rigs and hydraulic work-over units (HWUs). Furthermore, daily charter rates for the rigs are also substantially lower than before the fall in oil price,\" said CIMB. Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd, which has a \"sell\" call and a TP of 69 sen on the stock, also expects dampened performance ahead, as UMW-OG's Naga 6 contract will be expiring soon.

The pilgrim fund\\u2019s reserves have been substantially depleted due to the practice of paying bonuses that have exceeded its earnings since 2012. A look at Tabung Haji\\u2019s 2014 annual report reveals that in 2012, the fund paid RM2.46 billion in bonuses \\u2014 at a rate of 8% \\u2014 to its depositors, although net profit came in at only RM2.15 billion. Then in 2014, it did the same, paying out RM3.24 billion to depositors \\u2014 at a rate of 8.25% \\u2014 even though it only earned RM2.98 billion (see Table 1).  The 8.25% bonus rate in 2014 was the highest since 1998, according to Tabung Haji\\u2019s annual reports.\\u00a0 Interestingly, in the same period, when it obviously dipped into its reserves for the higher payouts, the growth rate of depositors\\u2019 savings exceeded that of its assets. Depositors\\u2019 savings doubled between 2010 and 2014 while its net assets expanded by 90.9% (see Table 2). \\u201cThe key point is, why did Tabung Haji continue to pay high dividends [bonuses] when it wasn\\u2019t supported by [a similar increase in] income growth?\\u201d asks an economist with a local asset management fund. \\u201cThe point of having reserves is to smooth out fluctuations in returns from year to year. So, save in a good year, run it down in a bad year. But it seems like they have been running it down even in the good years.\\u201d Since reaching a low of 3.25% in 2001, Tabung Haji\\u2019s bonus rate has been on an upward trend. In 2005, the bonus rate was 4.5% while in 2010, it increased to 5.5%. To recap, in the leaked Bank Negara Malaysia letter dated Dec 23, 2015, governor Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz reminded Tabung Haji chairman Datuk Seri Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim that the fund only had 98 sen of assets for every RM1 in liability. Note that Section 22 of the Tabung Haji Act says the fund cannot announce dividends and bonuses to its depositors if its assets are worth less than its obligations. Bank Negara did not stop with that reminder. On the same day, Zeti also sent a letter to the minister in charge of Islamic affairs, Datuk Seri Jamil Khir Baharom, to warn him that Tabung Haji\\u2019s finances could have a financial impact on the government as depositors\\u2019 savings are guaranteed, according to the Tabung Haji Act. Tabung Haji has not revealed its financial performance for the year ended Dec 31, 2015 (FY2015), but the leaked letter has raised concerns over its ability to pay bonuses to its depositors for FY2015. In response, Tabung Haji has given the assurance that it can still do so and that depositors\\u2019 savings are intact. The quantum of the bonus payout, however, will depend on the fund\\u2019s FY2015 performance. \\u201cLast year was a challenging one for us but due to our asset allocation strategy and risk management, we have managed to record a good performance,\\u201d Tabung Haji CEO Tan Sri Ismee Ismail said in a statement following news of the leaked letter. \\u201cHowever, Tabung Haji has to be prepared to face the challenging economic environment in 2016 and in the future so that it becomes more competitive. Therefore, we have to take into account the current economic situation in setting bonus rates,\\u201d added Ismee, who took the helm of the pilgrim fund in 2006. According to the statement, the assets and liabilities cited by Bank Negara in the letter do not take into account the current market value of equity investments under Tabung Haji\\u2019s subsidiaries and associate companies as well as its plantation and real estate assets. However, Tabung Haji\\u2019s equity investments last year do not look rosy, thanks to the bearish local equity market since the collapse in crude oil prices and slowdown in domestic and external economic growth. The FBM KLCI fell 3.44% in 2015 while the broader FBM EMAS came in 2.01% lower. According to Bloomberg, Tabung Haji\\u2019s largest holdings in Malaysian stocks by value are its shares in BIMB Holdings Bhd, followed by Sime Darby Bhd, Maxis Bhd,\\u00a0 TH Plantations Bhd, Malakoff Corp Bhd, Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd, IJM Corp Bhd, and Gamuda Bhd. Besides BIMB, in which Tabung Haji is the largest shareholder with a 52% stake, the fund is also the largest shareholder in TH Plantations with a 78.82% stake, and holds more than 10% equity interest in Malakoff, Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd, WCT Holdings Bhd, MCT Bhd and Pelikan International Corp Bhd. Of the fund\\u2019s top 10 stock holdings, only Maxis, Petronas Chemicals and IJM turned in a positive share price performance last year (see Table 3). The worst performing stock among the 10 was TH Plantations, which saw its share price drop 30.5% last year to RM1.16 as at last Thursday. TH Plantations has been hit by the drop in crude palm oil prices since 2011. Its earnings more than halved to RM17.9 million in the nine months ended Sept 30, 2015 (9MFY2015), from RM38.2 million in the previous corresponding period. Tabung Haji is also the largest shareholder in TH Heavy Engineering Bhd (THHE), a loss-making oil and gas fabrication and construction company. THHE\\u2019s losses widened 54% to RM30.2 million in 9MFY2015, from a net loss of RM19.5 million in the previous corresponding period. The fund is also the largest shareholder of information technology company Theta Edge Bhd \\u2014 which has been loss-making since 2010 \\u2014 with a 68.7% stake. As at Sept 30, 2015, Theta Edge was still in the red with a net loss of RM6.65 million. Besides the fund\\u2019s holdings in public-listed companies, it also invests in real estate. Among its real estate holdings are Menara TH in KLCC\\u2019s Platinum Park, several hotels in Saudi Arabia, three office buildings in the UK and a Grade A office building in Melbourne, Australia. Perhaps the most notable real estate acquisition undertaken by Tabung Haji recently was its purchase of a 0.64ha parcel in Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) from 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) last year for RM188 million, on which it intends to develop a residential tower. The purchase drew criticism from the public as it was done at 43 times the price paid by 1MDB when the latter acquired the TRX land from the federal government. Tabung Haji chairman Azeez later said the fund would sell the land and realise gains, although no deal has been announced to this day. To be fair, the problem with its liabilities outweighing its assets \\u2014 which pushed its reserves into the red \\u2014 lies mostly in the fund sustaining its high bonus rates. So unless there is a run on the fund by its depositors, Tabung Haji\\u2019s situation should be manageable, says the economist. \\u201cAs long as everybody doesn\\u2019t try to withdraw all at once, Tabung Haji should be okay,\\u201d he adds. There may be no immediate risks but it is always better to be safe than sorry and rein in the numbers before things take a turn for the worse."}, "328": {"date_posted": "27/1/2016", "title": "KLCI continues positive streak, up 4.88pts", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 27): The FBM KLCI continued its winning streak for the third straight session today, in tandem with the performance of regional markets.

To recap, SapuraKencana entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement with Petronas for a value of US$400 million back in November 2014. The latest development came after oil prices tumbled to below US$30 (RM129) per barrel recently, making the deal unattractive.\\u00a0 The cancellation of the deal would enable the group to preserve cash for working purposes, especially during tough times like this. We are keeping our earnings per share forecast as we did not include any potential contribution from the proposed acquisition. SapuraKencana has recently secured jobs with a combined value of US$117 million, namely hook-up and commissioning services for KNPG-B Phase II, a Kinabalu non-associated gas development project by THHE Fabricators Sdn Bhd for eight months starting the first quarter of 2016 (1Q16); engineering, procurement and construction of subsea isolation value systems by Hess Exploration & Production Malaysia BV at Block PM302, North Malay Basin, for 18 months ending 1Q17; and semi-tender assist drilling rig SKD Esperanza will be deployed to service Sarawak Shell Bhd/Sabah Shell Petroleum Co Ltd for 18 months with an optional extension of another 18 months.

Oil traders, analysts, stock market enthusiasts and government economists have spent the best part of 2015 crunching numbers, keeping an eye on regional geopolitical developments and anticipating volatile crude oil price movements in order to avoid placing the wrong bets on oil. Brent crude lost 35.3% in 2015 and hit its lowest price for the year at US$36.1 per barrel, sending chills down the spines of market observers. So, the question of how low crude oil prices can go must seem old by now. Yet, for those who are still looking to wager on the beaten sector, recent developments in the oil market show investors could be in for another rough ride in 2016. In September 2015, US investment bank Goldman Sachs, and more recently the International Monetary Fund, warned that crude prices could plummet to as low as US$20 a barrel in 2016 on the back of a persistent glut. With the possibility of Iran, which owns the world\\u2019s fourth largest oil reserves, pumping more after Western powers lift sanctions, the US Congress lifting a 40-year ban on crude exports and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) continues playing hardball over scaling down production, it is reasonable to expect the market to be flooded with cheap oil next year. Local analysts, however, tell The Edge that the forecast may be overbearish. MIDF Research analyst Aaron Tan says, \\u201cThe main issue with the oil price is not just oversupply, but deliberate oversupply. \\u201cSo, when you talk about the oil price, you have to consider two factors \\u2014 the asset break-even point, which is the point at which a particular oil asset can generate positive cash flow, and the fiscal break-even point at which the minimum sale price for a barrel of oil for a country to reach a budget surplus. After a certain point of decline, low prices become unsustainable.\\u201d Deliberate oversupply by Opec in its relentless drive to knock out shale competition will eventually have to end, he says. Opec has an unofficial production ceiling of 30 million barrels per day (bpd), but is producing 32 million bpd. Opec can still ramp up production to 36 million bpd, but the strain of overproducing in a climate of low prices is starting to show. Saudi Arabia has unveiled cuts to government expenditure, raised taxes and slashed fuel subsidies to cope. Bahrain has approved measures to cut state spending by 30% to weather the oil storm. The emir of Kuwait has pressed parliament to implement similar fiscal reforms. Even the oil cartel itself is reportedly tightening its belt by reducing expenditure on travel and freezing recruitment at its headquarters in Vienna. The same is being done by non-Opec countries like Malaysia. Further, worries over US oil flowing into the open market may also be overplayed. US shale oil is \\u201cheavy\\u201d and has a higher sulphur content than its competitors. A higher API gravity of shale means many refineries in the world are still unable to process it. \\u201cEven if you want to export US crude, you need to have offtakers. Globally, not many refineries can process heavy oil. To do that, you have to recalibrate your facilities and that can take six months to a year,\\u201d Tan says. Taking these factors into consideration, he says the chances of oil prices reaching US$20 per barrel and staying there is very unlikely. \\u201cI expect prices to rebound in the second half of 2016, and oil to trade around US$50 per barrel.\\u201d That, though, is not to say there is nothing to worry about for investors looking to put their money in oil and gas stocks. Analysts say even as oil prices recover in 2016, corporate earnings for oil-related stocks are expected to come under more pressure, the value of contracts to be awarded next year to shrink and an increasing number of impairments and assets and revision of prices of tendered projects. Such a prognosis makes even cherry-picking stocks difficult. However, Kenanga Research analyst Sean Lim says although catalysts for a rally in oil and gas stocks will be hard to come by, opportunities can still be found in companies whose share prices have been beaten down during the oil price collapse. \\u201cIcon Offshore Bhd and SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd are two companies that have suffered in 2015 due to their share prices. In a sense, their prices already bottomed out during the global stock market rout in August and have stopped reacting wildly to crude oil price volatility. The plus side here is that these stocks should rally when there is a sustained recovery in oil prices,\\u201d says Lim. Longer-term recommendations for the sector include companies that have a resilient cash flow to weather the weakness in crude oil prices. \\u201cYinson Holdings Bhd, which is expected to secure at least another floating production storage and offloading contract, and Dialog Group Bhd, which has Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u2019s Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development project in Pengerang to back its earnings, are safe longer-term options,\\u201d says Lim. Tan says the downstream subsegment is also expected to remain robust and relatively insulated from crude oil price troubles. His stock picks include Petronas Chemicals Bhd, which has announced three petrochemical projects within the Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex, and KNM Group Bhd, which stands to be a beneficiary of the supply of specialised process equipment.\\u00a0 For investors seeking exposure to a more predictable downstream company offering stable earnings, he recommends Gas Malaysia Bhd, as the adoption of the incentive-based regulation regime will provide better earnings visibility and predictability."}, "337": {"date_posted": "18/1/2016", "title": "Sultan of Kedah confers Datukship on MHB's MD", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 18): Malaysia Marine and Heaving Engineering Holdings Bhd's (MHB) managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO) Abu Fitri Abdul Jalil was conferred the Anugerah Darjah Datuk Setia Diraja Kedah (DSDK), which carries the title of Datuk, by the Sultan of Kedah.

ICON Offshore Bhd, which prides itself on being the largest pure offshore support vessel (OSV) provider in Malaysia, has had a rough voyage since its listing on Bursa Malaysia in June 2014. Some may blame it on the bad timing of the initial public offer by its controlling shareholder Ekuiti Nasional Bhd (Ekuinas). Its share price tanked shortly after the debut and shed 80.5% from RM1.85 in June 2014 to 36 sen last Tuesday \\u2014 barely one-fifth of the IPO price of RM1.85. Those who have a long-term view on the stock seem to think that the share price has reached the floor, barring any unforeseen circumstances. This nascent optimism stems from the fact that the company has seen signs of improvement operationally in its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3QFY2015). For one, the utilisation rate of its vessels improved to 61% from 58% in the previous quarter, albeit still lower than 79% a year ago. Meanwhile, its tender success rate also improved to 45%, compared with 33% in the previous quarter.  \\u00a0 Icon Offshore chalked up net profit of RM5.53 million in 3QFY2015, an improvement from RM4.57 million in 2QFY2015 but still far less than the RM18.95 million recorded in 3QFY2014. More importantly, it has a new management. Oil and gas industry veteran Amir Hamzah Azizan will take over the helm as managing director effective March 1 next year. Amir, son of the late Petronas CEO Tan Sri Azizan Zainul Abidin, will be leaving the national oil company. He is currently CEO of Petronas Lubricants International. He was also at the helm of Petronas Dagangan Bhd and MISC Bhd previously. His appointment is expected to boost investor confidence, says Maybank Investment Research. In addition, Captain Hassan Ali has been appointed chief operating officer while Ekuinas CEO Datuk Abdul Rahman Ahmad has been redesignated to executive director from non-executive director previously. Ekuinas has the lion\\u2019s share in Icon Offshore, holding a 48.5% stake through its vehicles Hallmark Odyssey Sdn Bhd and Sempena Fokus Sdn Bhd. \\u201cThe change in management will definitely help. Before this, it felt as though there was not really anyone in charge of things,\\u201d comments an analyst. Shortly after its debut, Icon Offshore was hit hard by the plunge in global crude oil prices from the peak of US$115 per barrel. By January this year, crude oil prices had more than halved to US$46.59 per barrel. Early this month, they were at around US$36. As if the weakness in crude oil prices wasn\\u2019t bad enough, Icon Offshore suffered another blow in April when its then CEO Dr Jamal Yusof and COO Rahman Yusof were sought by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission to assist in investigations. Until today, the nature of their involvement in the investigations has not been disclosed, but both men have resigned from the company. The company also had to deal with rumours of falsification of its bollard pull certificates for some of its vessels. It has denied all allegations. However, the future looks brighter. Maybank Research says in a recent report that Icon Offshore has outperformed its peers in terms of cost management, noting that its OSV peers are in the red despite operating at higher utilisation levels. \\u201cIcon\\u2019s ability to cost-down effectively and in a timely manner is commendable, with management having placed emphasis on fuel consumption optimisation, overhead cuts and savings from proactive vessel lay-ups and minimal safe manning, where possible,\\u201d says Maybank Research. An analyst says Petronas\\u2019 preference for Malaysian vessel owners will help companies like Icon Offshore. In fact, Maybank Research mentions in its report that the company had secured two charter wins in the third quarter and another three jobs in the fourth quarter at a time when its peers were being hit by early termination of contracts. \\u201cBut with crude oil prices hovering around US$40 per barrel, Petronas is having a hard time too. I think they will not be able to assist much unless oil prices rebound. That will be a catalyst for Icon,\\u201d opines the analyst. Looking at Icon Offshore\\u2019s balance sheet, short-term borrowings at RM158.76 million is more than five times the amount of cash available at RM29.78 million. The company\\u2019s times interest earned stands at only 1.64 times, based on its 3QFY2015 earnings. According to Maybank Research, Icon Offshore\\u2019s balance sheet discipline is evident from its decision to defer delivery of four new OSVs and terminate the purchase of an OSV asset to conserve its cash flow. \\u201cThe company planned to embark on a refinancing exercise, but so far, there hasn\\u2019t been any firm answer on that aspect. It would be difficult to refinance during such times, when liquidity is shrinking, and I don\\u2019t think banks are very keen on refinancing oil and gas companies,\\u201d says an analyst. At its current share price of 36 sen apiece, Icon Offshore is trading at a price-earnings ratio of 4.66 times. The stock has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d and three \\u201chold\\u201d calls. Only time will tell whether the new management will be able to continue turning around the company in an industry that is perceived by some to be overcrowded, at least for now. \\u00a0"}, "339": {"date_posted": "13/1/2016", "title": "Bina Puri targets RM1 bil worth of project wins in 2016", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 13): Bina Puri Holdings Bhd targets to secure construction projects worth RM1 billion this year, from both overseas and domestic market. \"We are confident of securing RM1 billion worth of construction projects, based on our previous track record,\" its group executive director Matthew Tee told pressmen in a media briefing today, adding that the group secures projects in excess of RM1 billion on a yearly basis.

We believe Muhibbah is well ahead of other contractors in this segment. Some 50% of the RM6 billion tender book is downstream oil & gas and marine/port-related, of which the bulk could be from Rapid. Just a 20% success rate will translates into RM1.2 billion in potential wins for Muhibbah in 2016, higher than our assumption of RM800 million.\\u00a0 The other RM3 billion from the total RM6 billion tender book are non-oil & gas jobs. New wins from the RM2.6 billion EPCC package to Samsung Engineering could be on the cards. The stock is trading 15% below its 2015 high. We believe there are several potential rerating factors in the coming months, including sustained positive newsflow for the infra segment; recovery in Rapid awards; other infra jobs in the rail, highways, and port/marine segments; margin expansion for its infra division; stronger earnings for its US dollar-driven Cambodian airport concessions, and recovery in foreign shareholdings which currently stand at just 10%. The stock trades at a still-attractive price-earnings ratio (PER) of 8-9 times financial year 2016-17 (FY16-17), which is at a 28% to 35% discount to the average construction sector PER of 13-15 times, unjustified in our view.

Also, he said any revenue and profit contributions from the themed attractions have not been imputed in the forecasts as ticket prices have not been finalised. \"Based on OWG's historical ticket prices in Genting Highlands, an average RM30 per ticket is not unreasonable. At pre-tax margin of 30%, the themed attractions division could lift FY16 to FY18F EPS by 10% to 25% and could raise our share price valuation to RM6.03,\" he noted. \"If we include the upside potential both from higher ticket prices and the themed attractions, our FY16 to FY18F EPS could rise by 16% to 71%, which could lift our share price valuation to RM8,\" he added. CIMB Research maintained its \"add\" rating on OWG, with an unchanged target price of RM4.93. Year to date, the counter has risen 239.33%.

YTL Power International Bhd yesterday signed a 30-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with PT PLN (Persero) worth US$2.7 billion (RM11.61 billion), marking the group's second investment in Indonesia. In a statement, YTL Power said its 80%-owned subsidiary, PT Tanjung Jati Power Co Ltd, has inked the PPA to restate and amend the original PPA that was entered into on April 2, 1997. Under the agreement, YTL Power is tasked to construct two units of 660-megawatt (MW) coal-fired power generating facility. Correspondingly, it will sell the energy and capacity from the facility to PLN. The project is expected to contribute positively to YTL Power\\u2019s future earnings. According to YTL Power, the project known as Tanjung Jati 'A' Coal Fired Independent Power project will be located at Cirebon, West Java, Indonesia, which will expire in 2051. YTL Power managing director Tan Sri Dr Francis Yeoh said in the statement the project will utilise state-of-the-art coal-fired technology and will be among the most efficient of the new generation of plants in the Indonesian system. YTL Power made its first Indonesian venture in 2004, after purchasing a stake in the 1,220MW Jawa Power project through its wholly-owned subsidiary PT YTL Jawa Timur. YTL Power owns 57.14% shares of YTL Jawa Power Holdings BV, which in turn owns 35% of the Jawa Power project. Gas Malaysia Bhd announced today that the government has increased the natural gas tariff for the non-power sector in Peninsular Malaysia by 17.11% on average, which will come into effect on next Friday (Jan 1, 2016). In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, Gas Malaysia said the gas tariff has been increased to RM25.53/mmbtu (million British Thermal Units) from RM21.80/mmbtu. The tariff for residential consumers, however, has been kept unchanged at RM19.52/mmbtu.\nConsumers that use up to 600mmbtu annually, under tariff category B, will see a higher tariff of RM23.78/mmbtu, from RM20.30 previously. The category C tariff (between 601mmbtu to 5,000mmbtu) will be 17.16% higher at RM23.90/mmbtu, while the category D tariff (between 5,001mmbtu to 50,000mmbtu) will go up 17.18% to RM24.14/mmbtu respectively. The new tariff for categories E and F stood at RM25.19/mmbtu, from RM21.50/mmbtu previously, while those consuming more than 750,000mmbtu will be charged RM26.03/mmbtu, compared to the previous RM22.22/mmbtu. Garments and plastic packaging products manufacturer Magni-Tech Industries Bhd saw its net profit soar 2.7 times year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM21.63 million in its second quarter ended Oct 31, 2015 (2QFY16) from RM8 million, largely due to the stronger US dollar against the ringgit during the period. Revenue for the quarter rose 21.8% y-o-y to RM197.34 million from RM162.04 million, its filing to Bursa Malaysia today showed. The company also declared a single-tier interim dividend of 5 sen per share, along with a special dividend of 3 sen per share for the financial year ending April 30, 2016 (FY16). Both dividends are payable on Jan 26, 2016, and will go ex on Jan 7. The group said its profit before taxation for the current quarter rose by 165%, mainly due to higher garment revenue and higher other operating income, which was largely contributed by the favourable currency exchange rate. It highlighted the stronger greenback resulted in a 27.5% increase in the segment's revenue, though that was partly offset by a 2.6% fall in revenue from its packaging business. For the first half of its financial year (1HFY16), net profit more than doubled y-o-y to RM37.2 million from RM18.09 million, as revenue rose 15% y-o-y to RM391.16 million from RM339.28 million. Going forward, the company expects its garments business to remain its major revenue contributor, which accounted for about 84.8% of its revenue for the financial period, and expects both its business divisions to remain profitable in the current financial year. However, it remains cautiously positive for the remainder of FY16, amid the uncertainty in the global economy. Aeon Credit Service (M) Bhd registered a net profit of RM53.36 million or 34.54 sen per share for the third quarter ended Oct 31, 2015 (3QFY16), on the back of RM245.78 million in revenue.\nThere were no comparative figures available, as the non-bank financial institution had changed its financial year-end to Feb 28 from Feb 20 previously. For the cumulative nine months (9MFY16), Aeon Credit\\u2019s net profit stood at RM160.09 million or 103.94 sen per share, while revenue stood at RM706.94 million, its filing with Bursa Malaysia today showed. Aeon Credit said its non-performing loans (NPL) ratio was 2.68% as at Nov 30, compared with 3.07% as at Nov 20, 2014 while total transaction and financing volume in 3QFY16 and 9MFY16 had risen by 8.71% to RM921.621 million and by 3.9% to RM2.658 billion respectively, compared with 3QFY15 and 9MFY15. Aeon Credit recorded other operating income of RM21.628 million for 3QFY16, mainly from bad debts recovered, commission income from the sale of insurance products, and AEON Big loyalty programme's processing fee. Ratio of total operating expenses against revenue for the quarter under review stood at 63.3% from the 60.4% seen in the quarter ended Nov 20 previously, mainly due to higher allowance for impairment losses on financing receivables. Going forward, Aeon Credit expects to maintain its performance for the financial year ending Feb 29, 2016 (FY16), based on the implementation of its business plan. Construction and engineering services specialist Eversendai Corp Bhd\\u00a0has inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Puspajaya Aluminium Sdn Bhd (PASB) today to jointly bid for projects. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, Eversendai said under the MoU, PASB shall be awarded as a subcontractor for works comprising the design, supply, fabrication and installation of aluminium/glazing facade should Eversendai Corp Sdn Bhd secure an award. Eversendai said the strategic tie-up with a facade specialised contractor of PASB's reputation, experience and standing will enhance the group's proposal for tenders as PASB has built a reputation as specialist in aluminium facade works with over 40 years of experience. PASB is a private company involved in the design, supply, fabrication and installation of facade and aluminium products, and related subcontract works. Timber products manufacturer Subur Tiasa Holdings Bhd saw its net profit for the first financial quarter ended Oct 31, 2015 (1QFY16) plunge 98.7% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM72,000 from RM5.69 million, on lower export volume of logs, plywood and particleboard. In its filing with Bursa Malaysia, the group also attributed the weaker performance to the drop in crude palm oil (CPO) and fresh fruit bunch average price, and higher raw material cost for timber and timber products. Revenue for 1QFY16 was down 32.9% y-o-y at RM145.21 million from RM216.27 million. On outlook, Subur Tiasa said timber prices are expected to sustain in anticipation of tight supply of logs and firm demand from timber consuming countries, especially India, which is a steadily growing market. The company said the strong US Dollar (USD) against the ringgit will also help its export sales, which are predominantly in US dollar. Mudajaya Group Bhd has bagged a RM220 million contract to undertake engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning works of warehouses and workshops for the refinery and petrochemical integrated development (Rapid) project in Pengerang, Johor. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Mudajaya said its wholly-owned subsidiary Mudajaya Corp Bhd was awarded the contract on Dec 11 by PRPC Utilities and Facilities Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of Petroliam Nasional Bhd.

In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, the civil engineering outfit said its wholly-owned subsidiary, Gadang Engineering (M) Sdn Bhd, has been awarded with the contract by PRPC Utilities and Facilities Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary under the Petronas Group last Friday (Dec 11). Gadang is tasked to undertake a project known as \"Utilities, Interconnecting, Offsite (UIC) facilities: procurement, construction and commissioning (PCC) of civil and intrastructure works\" at Storm Water East Area at Pengerang, Johor.

In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, Wintoni said the delay is due to it only recently finalising the appointment of a third party audit firm to provide an opinion on its results, and more time is required for the audit firm to finalise its opinion. To recap, Wintoni, a business solution provider and designer of automation systems, had seen a 62.5% drop in its share price from 16 sen on Nov 25 to 6 sen on Dec 7, after the company said it was unable to submit its financial statements for 3QFY15 due to loss of data, following a recent break in to its office.

Comintel said profitability improved on account of higher profit margins contributed by the manufacturing segment, while strengthening of the US dollar, shipment of better margin products and cost improvement initiatives have helped to improve profit margins. The manufacturing segment recorded an increase in revenue of RM23.2 million to RM105.2 million, due to more products shipped in 3QFY16; as well as the strengthening of the US dollar against the ringgit. The company said its communication and system integration segment saw an increase of RM2.5 million to RM4.3 million, due to the completion of more projects in 3QFY16. REDtone International Bhd posted a net profit of RM398,000 or 0.05 sen per share in its second quarter ended Oct 31, 2015 (2QFY16), on a revenue of RM35.07 million.

RAM Ratings, which has assigned an AA1(s)/stable rating to Samalaju\\u2019s proposed Sukuk Murabahah programme, said Samalaju will be the operator of the RM1.9 billion Samalaju Port upon its expected completion by the fourth quarter of financial year 2016 (4QFY16), under a 40-year contract. The construction of the port will also be financed with a government grant of RM500 million, and an equity injection from Samalaju\\u2019s parent company Bintulu Port Holdings Bhd (BPHB) of RM600 million. RAM Ratings said its rating on Samalaju\\u2019s programme reflects an unconditional and irrevocable corporate guarantee extended by BPHB (rated AA1/stable/P1). \\u201cIn view of BPHB\\u2019s solid relationship with the Malaysian government \\u2014 given the latter\\u2019s shareholdings in BPHB through various government agencies, the Sarawak government and Petronas (Petroliam Nasional Bhd) \\u2014 the state is seen as having an incentive to provide the company with financial assistance, which includes subscribing to a portion of the proposed sukuk, if necessary,\\u201d the statement read. As such, it \"believes the company will continue to derive financial flexibility from BPHB and the state\". The construction of the port will take place in two phases \\u2014 the construction of Phase 1, which is on-going, is expected to cost RM1.6 billion, while interim port facilities have been completed in April 2014 and have been operational since, the statement read. However, delays in the construction of capital dredging, reclamation work and breakwater section has, as at end-November 2015, pushed Samalaju approximately 6.7 months behind schedule, RAM Ratings said. Therefore, the ratings agency has factored in an additional RM61.3 million construction cost overrun in its projections against Samalaju\\u2019s estimate of RM28.4 million and assumed a lower cargo volume, after the port becomes fully operational, as six energy-intensive companies that will operate at the Samalaju Park have not made any long-term throughput commitment to the port. Hence, RAM Ratings said it foresees Samalaju incurring further debt (in absence of shareholder support), with the projected gearing ratio to peak at a high 2.95 times over the next five years and its funds from operations debt coverage ratio averaging at a weak 0.06 times, as compared to the vompany\\u2019s projection of 1.30 times and 0.17 times, respectively. Meanwhile, the port\\u2019s proposed tariffs, although approved by the state government in October 2015, have yet to be gazetted, even though it is expected to be completed by end-2015. \\u201cWe highlight that the company\\u2019s earnings and cashflow will come under further pressure, should the gazetted tariffs be lower than the proposed tariffs,\\u201d said RAM Ratings. However, it noted that any additional debt would be subordinated to the proposed sukuk in terms of coupon, tenure and security. The port is anticipated to handle up to 46 million tonnes when fully completed, and will function as a logistical hub for the import of raw materials and export of finished products from heavy-industry companies located at the Samalaju Park.

Top Glove Corp Bhd\\u2019s net profit jumped about 2.6 times or 163.7% to RM128.35 million in the first quarter ended Nov 30, 2015 (1QFY16), from a year earlier, as rubber glove sales volume grew amid weaker raw material prices and ringgit. In a filing with Bursa, Top Glove said its 1QFY16 net profit rose from RM48.68 million. Revenue was higher at RM800.28 million versus RM567.63 million. \"Sales volume (quantity sold) attained an all-time high, which signifies a growth of 15% against 1QFY15, largely attributed to nitrile glove sales, which increased 54% compared with 1QFY15. \"The strong US dollar and lower raw material prices have further boosted the group\\u2019s performance,\" Top Glove said in notes accompanying its financials. Top Glove's chairman Tan Sri Lim Wee Chai said in a separate statement that the company's 1QFY16 revenue at RM800.28 million was a quarterly record. WCT Holdings Bhd has bagged a RM322.57 million construction contract at Petroliam Nasional Bhd's (Petronas) Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (Rapid) in Johor. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, WCT said the contract involved storm drainage work at Rapid.

UEM Edgenta Bhd is acquiring 80% in integrated facilities management specialist KFM Holdings Sdn Bhd for RM128 million, a deal which is expected to provide it with immediate access to KFM's clientele in Malaysia and abroad. In a statement to Bursa Malaysia, UEM Edgenta said it signed the share sale agreement with Nurolamin Abas and Fardan Abdul Majeed to buy the 80% KFM stake under a cash and share deal. Nurolamin and Fardan are currently the sole owners of KFM. \"KFM is a key player in the integrated facilities management sector, with strong track record.

PPB Group Bhd's 18.3%-owned associate, Wilmar International Ltd, is capitalising on newly-appointed chief operating officer Pua Seck Guan's expertise to undertake property projects. Singapore's The Straits Times quoted Wilmar chairman and chief executive Kuok Khoon Hong as saying that the Perennial Real Estate chief executive Pua could open the door to ventures into real estate projects for agribusiness-based Wilmar. \"In many places where Wilmar has significant operations, we have been offered attractive projects by the local government, which we declined, as we do not have expertise in property development. \"With the association with Perennial through Mr Pua, these projects can be undertaken by Perennial, with Wilmar maybe taking a small stake. Successful development of these projects will enhance Wilmar's relationship with the government and standing of the company in those places,\" Kuok said. Wilmar and Perennial are listed on the Singapore exchange, while PPB is listed on Bursa Malaysia. Hiap Teck Venture Bhd registered a net loss of RM37.22 million for its first quarter ended Oct 31, 2015 (1QFY16), mainly due to its share of loss from a jointly controlled entity, making it its fourth consecutive quarterly loss. A year ago, it registered a net profit of RM2.85 million, its filing to Bursa Malaysia showed. Its latest quarterly revenue, however, was 3.2% higher at RM317.31 million, compared with the RM307.46 million it recorded in the same period last year. Its share of loss from the jointly-controlled entity amounted to RM50.21 million, which is due to unrealised foreign exchange loss arising from US dollar-denominated shareholders' loan and higher costs associated with trial production. \"To minimise its losses, the jointly controlled entity has temporarily suspended its trial production in October 2015,\" it added. Pintaras Jaya Bhd's unit, Pintaras Geotechnics Sdn Bhd, has bagged a piling contract for a service apartment project here, valued at RM21.5 million. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, the civil engineering company said it had received a Letter of Award dated Nov 27, 2015 from City View Ventures Sdn Bhd. The contract was for the execution and completion of piling works for a proposed service apartment at Jalan Kia Peng, Kuala Lumpur. \"The said works are to commence tomorrow (Dec 16), with a completion period of 10 months,\" it added. Pintaras Jaya expects the contract to contribute positively to its future earnings. Johor-based electronic manufacturing services provider VS Industry Bhd saw its net profit jump 70.8% to RM60.18 million in the first quarter ended Oct 31, 2015 (1QFY16), from RM35.22 million a year earlier, on higher sales from its Malaysian operations and foreign exchange gain. 1QFY16's revenue grew 12.5% to RM612.47 million, from RM544.56 million, its filing to Bursa Malaysia today showed. VS Industry said the improved earnings for the quarter was mainly due to higher sales from its Malaysian operations, while it recorded a net foreign exchange gain of RM14.61 million versus RM61,000 in the same period last year. It also declared a first interim single-tier dividend of 1.5 sen per share for the financial year ending July 31, 2016 (FY16), payable on Mar 11, 2016. OCK Group Bhd's rights issue with warrants has been oversubscribed by 28.16% at the close of acceptance and payment on Dec 8, with a total of 338.44 million valid applications for the issuance, against a total number of 264.08 million rights shares available for subscription. The rights shares and warrants are targeted to be listed on Dec 22, 2015. The group said it aims to expand either through the acquisition of telecommunication companies or assets, or via building its own telecommunication infrastructure and equipment. OCK said it had, with its partner King Royal Technologies Co Ltd, entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Telenor Myanmar Ltd, to build and lease tower infrastructure to Telenor, and the agreement is expected to be finalised this month. Berjaya Media Bhd saw its net profit for the second quarter ended Oct 31, 2015 (2QFY16) plunge 92.7% to RM54,000, from RM741,000 in the previous year, largely on lower revenue registered by Sun Media Corp Sdn Bhd (SunMedia), the publisher of The Sun newspaper. Revenue for the quarter was down 13.23% to RM11.81 million, from RM13.61 million, due to lower advertising income recorded by Sun Media. \\u00a0 For the six months period (1HFY16), Berjaya Media sank into red with a net loss of RM951,000, compared with a RM1.98 million net profit in 1HFY15. \\u00a0 This was due to lower revenue and impairment loss on fair value of quoted investments, according to the group's filing with Bursa today. \\u00a0 Going forward, Berjaya Media expects it to continue to operate in a competitive business environment, and will continue to focus on improving its advertising revenue.

The construction giant could sell the block of shares, a source familiar with the company says.  The source adds that while the block of shares has drawn interest from some parties, no decision has been made on what IJM Corp will do with it. IJM Corp\\u2019s lack of interest could be due to the dampened sentiment since the oil boom ended, which has caused Scomi\\u2019s share price to tumble. One of the interested parties looking to buy the 7.66% stake or 119.11 million shares is said to be a group of businessmen that includes Datuk Kamaluddin Abdullah. It is understood that talks between the two parties \\u2014 IJM Corp and the group of businessmen \\u2014 have been ongoing. \\u201cThere is still time to decide what to do with the stake in Scomi; IJM Corp has options,\\u201d the source says. To recap, IJM Corp\\u2019s initial plan was to hold as much as 25.08% equity interest to become the controlling shareholder of Scomi in a deal valued at RM149.31 million back in 2012. IJM Corp took up a 119.11 million share placement or 9.6% of Scomi for RM39.31 million or 33 sen per share. In addition, it subscribed for three-year zero coupon redeemable convertible secured bonds with an aggregate nominal value of RM110 million. If IJM Corp converts the bonds, it would have about an additional 15.5% in Scomi. The bonds held by IJM Corp are convertible into new Scomi shares at a conversion price of 36.5 sen per share. The bonds mature on Feb 5 \\u2014 barely two months from now. Scomi\\u2019s shares closed at 20.5 sen last Friday, after hitting a low of 14 sen in late August. Considering the current price of Scomi shares, and the prevailing poor sentiment in the oil and gas sector, the conversion of the debt paper into shares seems unlikely.  Given the current weak share price, the logical move for IJM Corp is to ask for a cash redemption of the convertible bonds which carry a 10% annual yield. As at end-September, Scomi had cash balances of RM236.03 million, with short-term borrowings of RM695.72 million and long-term debt amounting to RM180.10 million. For its six months ended Sept 30, Scomi registered a net profit of RM14.74 million on the back of RM717.65 million in revenue. It is noteworthy that Scomi\\u2019s finance cost for the six months under review was RM18.26 million, close to 124% of its net profit. Scomi\\u2019s three main businesses are directly owned oil and gas mud drilling, monorail systems manufacturing held under its 72.33% owned subsidiary Scomi Engineering Bhd, and oil and gas support services housed under its 65.66%-owned unit Scomi Energy Services Bhd. Both subsidiaries are public listed entities. If Kamaluddin were to buy the block in Scomi it would strengthen his grip on the company. He and his business partner, Shah Hakim @ Shahzanim Bin Zain, the CEO of Scomi, have a joint 11% stake via Kaspadu Sdn Bhd. The relationship between the two soured in 2012, and IJM Corp\\u2019s entry into Scomi was seen as a means to prevent Kamaluddin and parties acting with him from gaining control of Scomi. While it is not clear what happened, Kamaluddin is said to have had differences of opinion with Shah on the direction of Scomi. Some of the corporate personalities who rallied behind Kamaluddin then and acquired substantial stakes were Tan Sri Abu Sahid Mohamed, and Datuk Phillip Siew Mun Chuang. Scomi partnered Australian outfit Cue Energy Resources Ltd, looking to morph into a risk service contractor and develop a marginal oil field for Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas), but this did not materialise. A year later, Scomi\\u2019s luck improved, and the company, partnering Ophir Production and Vestigo Petroleum Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned unit of Petronas, bagged a small field risk service contract. Of late, Kamaluddin, who is the son of former prime minister Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, has been in the corporate news, surfacing in Enra Group Bhd (formerly known as Perduren (M) Bhd) with a 36.4% stake. Enra is exploring opportunities in the oil and gas sector and has appointed such powerhouses as Tan Sri Shamsul Azhar Abbas, the former president and CEO of Petronas, and Datuk Anuar Ahmad, former executive vice-president of Petronas\\u2019 gas and power business, to Enra\\u2019s board. Will IJM Corp\\u2019s divestment plan pave the way for Kamaluddin to strengthen his hold on Scomi? And subsequently, will the duo from Petronas be appointed to Scomi\\u2019s board if Kamaluddin takes control? While this remains to be seen, one thing is for sure \\u2014 Scomi needs money for the bond redemption.

Petronas Dagangan Bhd (PetDag) will be divesting its Vietnamese businesses after its wholly-owned subsidiary PDB (Netherlands) B.V (PDBN) entered into two share sale and purchase agreements (SSPAs) with Totalgaz Vietnam Ltd, as part of the group's portfolio rationalisation strategy. The SSPAs with Totalgaz will see the divestment of PDBN's entire 100% equity interests in Petronas (Vietnam) Co Ltd and Thang Long LPG Company Ltd. The group said both companies, incorporated in Vietnam, are involved in the bottling and distribution of liquefied petroleum gas in Vietnam. The divestment is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2016, subject to the conditions of the SSPAs being met. Major oil palm growers, including Malaysia's Sime Darby Bhd will conduct trials of a sustainable cultivation scheme under the Sustainable Palm Oil Manifesto. Companies including Sime Darby, Singapore-based Musim Mas and the US' Cargill Inc are signatories of the manifesto, which advocates the high carbon stock (HCS) scheme launched today. Sime Darby said the HCS methodology was built on three pillars. The list comprises ecosystem maintenance, socio-economic benefits for local communities and economic viability. Sime Darby's unit, Sime Darby Plantation Sdn Bhd's managing director Datuk Franki Anthony Dass said the group intended to carry out trials at its oil palm plantations in Liberia. He said Liberia was chosen, because Sime Darby's estimated 10,000 ha of plantations there, were the group's only greenfield development. Comfort Gloves Bhd's performance in its third quarter ended Oct 31, 2015 (3QFY16) continued to show the fruits of its expansion exercise this year, when net profit came in almost 11 times higher year-on-year (y-o-y) at RM7.17 million, from RM672,000 previously. Revenue for the quarter under review rose 59.6% y-o-y to RM61.28 million, from RM38.39 million, according to the company's Bursa Malaysia filing today. The company was formerly known as Integrated Rubber Corp Bhd. On a cumulative basis (9MFY16), Comfort Gloves' net profit rose a little over 10 times to RM16.26 million, from RM1.59 million; while revenue came in 51.2% higher y-o-y at RM171.2 million, from RM113.22 million previously. Looking ahead, Comfort Gloves said it expects the demand and consumption of rubber gloves in Asia and other emerging economies to increase, on the back of rising awareness in healthcare. As such, it expects it will continue to capture a bigger market share in Asia and United States, which currently contributes 80% to its revenue. Pasdec Holdings Bhd, a 51.65%-owned subsidiary of the Pahang state government, has warned it will slip into its first full-year net loss this financial year ending Dec 31, 2015 (FY15), after three years of profits, mainly due to higher expenses incurred from the relocation of its automotive manufacturing operations from South Africa to Botswana. For the nine months period ended Sept 30, 2015 (9MFY15), the group reported a net loss of RM18.13 million, compared with a net profit of RM981,000 a year ago, dragged by relocation, training and retrenchment costs, following the relocation of its auto manufacturing activities. Revenue fell 4% to RM145.86 million, from RM151.96 million. Pasdec's senior vice-president of corporate resources, Goh Song Han, said it would likely take another year for the business to turn around in FY17. Goh said the group is also looking to balance its business portfolio between property development and auto manufacturing in the next two to three years. For now, the property segment which accounted for 47% of its revenue in 9MFY15, will remain the main contributor to the group\\u2019s turnover, while the group waits for the auto manufacturing business in Botswana to stabilize. Today, Pasdec also signed a share subcription agreement with BDC to formalise the group's commitment to invest in Botswana. Under the joint venture (JV), Pasdec will hold a 70% stake in the JV company, Pasdec Automotive Technologies Proprietary Botswana Ltd (PAT BW), while BDC will own the remaining 30% shares. PAT BW's chief executive officer Datuk Kevin Pather noted that the total investment to construct the Botswana plant is around US$15 million, which will cater to the auto market in the northern and central African regions. In the next 18 to 24 months, Pather said PAT BW will invest around US$10 million in the Botswana plant, that will cater to its two major customers \\u2014 Volkswagen and Nissan/Renault \\u2014 in the immediate term.

Ooi had disposed of 41.39 million shares of the company, representing a 22.29% indirect stake, on Nov 13. After the disposal, Ooi is left with a 0.96% indirect stake.

Reuters reported that Felda Group still plans to buy 37% of PT Eagle High Plantations Tbk in a restructured deal, a managing director of the Indonesian firm's parent company said, sending shares in Eagle High soaring. The companies are finalising the price, Rajawali's managing director Darjoto Setyawan told Reuters in a text message interview. Last month, the Malaysian group's main unit, Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd (FGV), said it needed to rethink its planned purchase of a 37% stake in Eagle High for USUS$680 million, after its shareholders criticised the deal as too expensive. The deal was set to be biggest acquisition so far for Felda Global, the world's no. 3 palm plantation operator, which has been looking to expand its landbank. Under the new deal, Felda Global may take less than 10% in Eagle High, with the remainder bought by Felda Investment, a separate unit of Felda Group. In response to the Rajawali comments, Felda Global said in a statement that it was continuing to evaluate a possible different mode of investment in Eagle High and that an announcement would be made in 2016. Shares of Eagle High jumped 8.1% in afternoon trade today. It closed at IDR132, up 18.92%. FGV ended 1.9% higher at RM1.61.

But the company has run into more than a little resistance. The day YTL Power\\u2019s power purchase agreement (PPA) expired, Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) immediately cut off the gas supply to the Paka power plant, as well as YTL Power\\u2019s 400mw plant in Pasir Gudang that expired on the same day. Note that the Paka plant has been awarded an extension for only 600mw of the total capacity. The Pasir Gudang plant did not get an extension. Likewise, Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) disconnected both plants from the grid, according to industry sources. This means that in the event of a power shortage, the national grid would not be able to draw on some 1,200mw worth of power controlled by YTL Power. At the same time, both government-linked companies (GLCs) have been giving YTL Power (fundamental: 1.50; valuation: 1.40) a tough time in finalising the PPA extension for the Paka plant. According to the industry sources, Petronas has been delaying the signing of the new gas supply agreement (GSA), which is critical for the new PPA. It is worth noting that YTL Power is suing Petronas for an estimated RM700 million in overpayments for gas supplied. In a written reply, Petronas tells The Edge, \\u201cThe GSA between Petronas and YTL Power came to an end on Sept 30, 2015. A new GSA has yet to be entered into. As with any commercial arrangement, the terms of the agreement will have to be agreed to by both parties and are subject to the approval of both parties\\u2019 management.\\u201d At the same time, TNB has also not signed the PPA, saying that YTL Power needs to first sign a new land lease agreement (LLA) for the land on which the Paka power plant stands. The land is owned by the utility.\\u00a0 However, the government has already intervened, hoping to resolve the impasse, say sources. Following mediations between the conflicting parties last month, the Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water instructed Petronas to sign the GSA and TNB the PPA. But the GLCs have yet to sign on the dotted line. Is Petronas obliged to\\u00a0supply gas? On one hand, it can be argued that Petronas is obliged to supply gas to YTL Power since it holds a monopoly on gas in the country. But if that is the case, why did the ministry need to intervene? Applying the Competition Act 2010 should have resolved the issue. Some might argue that Petronas does not monopolise the country\\u2019s gas supply, since the regasification terminal in Melaka has open access, allowing for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by third parties. Although it hasn\\u2019t been done yet, YTL Power could theoretically import its own LNG. Even if it were more expensive, any increment on fuel costs will be passed on to TNB. However, industry players say such an arrangement would be impractical and not commercially viable simply because LNG would be supplied on a take or pay basis while the PPA with TNB is not. It would make more sense for the stakeholders involved for Petronas to supply the gas. The question is \\u2014 why is it holding back on the GSA? \\u201cPetronas views the arbitration matter and the new GSA as two separate and distinct matters,\\u201d the state oil firm stressed when asked on the matter. But with such a large sum \\u2014 RM700 million \\u2014 at stake, observers say Petronas could be holding back on signing the GSA as leverage. Recall that earlier this year, Petronas sought to arbitrate the matter with YTL Power in London. It was reported that evidential hearings since March had ruled in favour of YTL Power. In brief, Petronas had a contract to supply gas to YTL Power for its two power plants at a predetermined price in 1993, but it raised prices in 1997. YTL Power had to pay the excess over the years but is now suing Petronas for the difference \\u2014 approximately RM700 million with interest. Petronas could not comment on the arbitration since it is subject to a confidentiality agreement, but tells The Edge that it has filed an application to set aside the arbitration award at the Kuala Lumpur High Court. \\u201cIn turn, YTL has also applied to strike out Petronas\\u2019 application. Both applications will be heard on Nov 30, 2015,\\u201d adds Petronas. \\u00a0 Unable to land the PPA TNB wants to sign a new LLA with YTL Power, despite the fact that the existing lease expires only in end-2018. And without the new LLA, TNB is reluctant to enter into a PPA with YTL Power.\\u00a0 The extension for YTL Power\\u2019s power plant runs from March 1, 2016 to Dec 31, 2018. Hence, there is no need to renegotiate the LLA. It is understood that the Energy Commission originally intended to extend YTL Power\\u2019s PPA until end-2019 but settled for the shorter extension to match the existing LLA. \\u201cYTL Power\\u2019s land is about 16ha but not all of it is in use. TNB wants to sign a new LLA so that it can take back the unused portion,\\u201d explains one source. When contacted, TNB declined to comment. It is learnt that the Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water wrote to TNB saying that the new LLA should not be a condition precedent to the signing of the PPA. But even if TNB were to sign the PPA, it would still be useless without a GSA as the PPA is conditional upon YTL Power securing a GSA from Petronas.

The announcement, however, did not have the expected impact on the stock, which shed seven sen to close at RM2.19 last Thursday.\\u00a0 Naturally, SapuraKencana will not see any contribution from the development of the gas field in the near term, but it is likely to become a fresh recurring income source for the group in two years.\\u00a0 The share price had in fact rebounded from a historical low of RM1.47 recorded on Aug 25, gaining more than 50% \\u2014 that is \\u00a0until last Thursday \\u2014 possibly buoyed by the impending news of the FDP. President and CEO Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin tells The Edge: \\u201cThis is a significant milestone as we will begin the monetisation of the seven gas discoveries we have to date off Sarawak. First gas is expected to flow in the final quarter of 2017 and we will see healthy cash contributions over the life of this development. \\u201cLooking ahead, given the discoveries and the ongoing exploration programme, SapuraKencana will be a strategic leader in the Malaysian liquefied natural gas business. We will have clear visibility of the cash flow once the development of these discoveries commences.\\u201d The gas fields are a result of SapuraKencana acquiring Newfields Holding Inc\\u2019s Malaysian oil and gas assets for US$898 million early last year. Petronas had awarded Newfields, Mitsubishi and Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd a production-sharing contract for Block SK310 off Sarawak in June 2008.\\u00a0 Newfields was appointed the operator of the block, which is located in water depths of between 50m and 100m in the Central Luconia Province, off Sarawak, and covers about 3,460 sq km. \\u201cIt [new gas field development] should be good with the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons reaching equilibrium in 18 to 24 months,\\u201d Shahril muses. To recap, SapuraKencana has a 30% stake in the gas field while Petronas Carigali, the exploration arm of Petronas, owns 40%. The remaining 30% is held by Diamond Energy Sarawak Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of Japan\\u2019s Mitsubishi Corp. \\u00a0 Besides the 30% of the profit it should rake in, SapuraKencana could also bag jobs for the development of the field. \\u201cJobs will be tendered out for the project and not just us but everyone. SapuraKencana will have to be competitive,\\u201d Shahril says.\\u00a0 He is understandably tight-lipped, unwilling to divulge any details of the possible contracts the company is eyeing. According to the company\\u2019s announcement to Bursa Malaysia, among the big-ticket items is a central processing platform (CPP) with a 35km gas evacuation pipeline that is tied to the existing infrastructure. SapuraKencana, of course, has the expertise in both the fabrication of CPPs and pipe laying. Considering that the gas field is not that large, the CPP fabrication job should be worth a few hundred million US dollars while the pipe-laying contract, depending on a whole host of factors, could also come up to hundreds of millions of US dollars. Should SapuraKencana win any of these jobs, that would add to its RM23 billion order book, comprising largely international transport and installation, and fabrication jobs in several parts of the world, including Brazil. While Shahril would not comment on the likelihood of a gas sales agreement being concluded, Kenanga Investment Bank\\u2019s oil and gas analyst, Sean Lim, says: \\u201cWe were guided that the gas sales agreement has a duration of 5.5 years and that the field is estimated to generate total Ebitda of US$83 million (US$25 million for SapuraKencana\\u2019s 30% stake) per annum for the field, assuming the field is able to ramp up to full production within three to six months of the commencement of operations at current oil prices.\\u201d According to Lim, the field can produce 100 million standard cubic feet per day of hydrocarbon gas for Petronas LNG\\u2019s complex in Bintulu, Sarawak. While the selling price of gas at the point of production in 2018 is uncertain, at present, LNG is going for about US$3.60 per million British thermal units (mmbtu). SapuraKencana, Petronas Carigali and Mitsubishi are expected to split the profits after deducting the cost of production, tax and royalties, among others. An industry observer opines that with the locked-in gas sales agreement, there is limited risk for the three partners, but cautions that the earnings will only trickle in from 2018, which explains why there was no effect on SapuraKencana\\u2019s share price. Says the oil and gas market watcher, \\u201cIt [field development plan approval] will only start having an impact on SapuraKencana\\u2019s bottom line in 2018 as first gas delivery is likely to be in the fourth quarter of 2017.  \\u201cThere are no earnings as yet, so there will be no impact [on the bottom line] until a few years, maybe three, from now and not many people factor in the three years ahead.\\u201d She also says diversification into gas from just oil will add a new income stream to SapuraKencana, which augurs well for the company.\\u00a0 Like most oil and gas players, SapuraKencana has been adversely affected by soft crude oil prices, which have fallen off a high of US$110 per barrel in September 2013 to below US$50 per barrel now. \\u00a0 For its six months ended July 31, 2015, SapuraKencana registered a net profit of RM364.8 million from revenue of RM5.1 billion. It had cash amounting to RM1.8 billion, long-term debt commitments of RM9.5 billion and short-term borrowings of RM8.4 billion. According to Kenanga\\u2019s Lim, the capital expenditure needed for the project is estimated at US$300 million, stretching up to the fourth quarter of 2017. He says SapuraKencana has already secured the funding for its 30% stake, which works out to US$90 million, through multi-currency facilities. This means there is no impact on the company\\u2019s gearing, which at present stands at \\u00a0about 1.3 times. Lim maintains his \\u201cmarket perform\\u201d call on SapuraKencana and has revised his target price from RM2.04 to RM2.38, valuing the group at a target price-earnings ratio of 14 times to factor in better prospects from its gas project."}, "372": {"date_posted": "25/11/2015", "title": "Petronas Gas awards contract to Barakah", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 25): Barakah Offshore Petroleum Bhd secured a RM12.3 million gas-transport project from Petronas Gas Bhd.

In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, the water treatment operator, which has ventured into oil and gas, said its revenue for 3QFY15 slumped 76.06% to RM46.25 million from RM193.22 million a year ago. For the cumulative nine months ended Sept 30, 2015 (9MFY15), the company's net profit slipped 0.83% to RM165.3 million, from RM166.68 million last year. Revenue dropped 52% to RM175.18 million from RM364.99 million in 9MFY14. According to management, the decrease in revenue in the current financial quarter and financial year to date was mainly due to lower revenue contribution from the oil and gas segment as a result of the downturn in the oil and gas sector. For the current quarter under review, the water and wastewater segment reported a loss before interest and tax of RM3.6 million, compared to RM2.2 million last year, mainly due to higher operating expenses. The oil and gas segment also reported a loss before interest of RM17.9 million as compared to a profit before interest of RM7.5 million last year, because of the lower revenue as a result of the downturn in the oil and gas sector. The construction segment, however, reported a profit before interest of RM1.1 million in the current financial quarter as compared to a loss before interest of RM7.2 million last year, due to higher profit contribution. Post completion of the proposed disposals of water assets, the group is looking to continuously expand its operations in areas related to its core businesses and core competencies in water and wastewater, sewerage, environmental engineering and construction and oil and gas, both locally and abroad. Meanwhile, the group will also explore opportunities in new business sectors, such as oil palm plantation sector and property development sector. Despite the downturn in the oil and gas sector, the group hopes to secure projects for its transportation and installation operations of offshore facilities under the ongoing Pan Malaysia Package B contract with Petronas from 2014 to 2016. On the construction sector, the group will continue to be involved in the construction of water-related and sewerage facilities.

While MHSB shall make available, or procure Angkasa to make available, its customer network for the marketing and distribution of the new company's products. Sport shoes sole maker Multi Sports Holdings Ltd sank into the red for the second consecutive quarter, no thanks to the sluggish consumer sentiments arising from headwinds in the global and China's economies, which resulted in lower sale number. The higher operating costs have also eroded the company's margins for the quarter, it told Bursa in a filing today. For its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3QFY15), Multi Sports reported a net loss of RM9.79 million or 1.89 sen per share compared to a net profit of RM7.75 million or 1.5 sen per share a year ago. In the immediate preceding quarter (2QFY15), Multi Sports recorded a net loss of RM6.09 million. Revenue came in 23.5% higher at RM123.24 million from RM99.78 million in the previous year. For the cumulative half-year period (1HFY15), Multi Sports registered a net loss of RM9.72 million, compared to a net profit of RM27.10 million in 1HFY14; while revenue climbed 7% to RM301.84 million from RM281.64 million a year ago. Kretam Holdings Bhd posted a net loss of RM8.08 million or 0.43 sen per share for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3QFY15), compared with a net profit of RM1.57 million or 0.08 sen per share in the same quarter last year, largely on rising costs, and falling earnings in its plantation and mill operations due to lower crude palm oil (CPO) prices. Notably, its cost of sales and services for the latest quarter rose 16.44% to RM101.19 million versus RM86.9 million in 3QFY14, while its \"other expenses\" grew over 45 times to RM7.87 million, from a mere RM172,000 previously, its filing to Bursa today showed. Meanwhile, revenue gained 6.9% to RM111.81 million, from RM104.6 million in 3QFY14. For the cumulative nine-month period (9MFY15), Kretam posted a net loss of RM13.24 million or 0.71 sen per share, compared to a net profit of RM8.64 million or 0.47 sen per share in 9MFY14. Revenue for the period was down 0.3% at RM289.3 million versus RM290.15 million in 9MFY14. Steel manufacturer Lion Corp Bhd's net losses doubled to RM176 million or 13.35 sen in the first quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (1QFY15) from RM85.93 million or 6.53 sen per share a year ago as revenue shrunk, and foreign exchange (forex) losses came in higher. Revenue for the quarter shrunk 43.7% to RM340.6 million, from RM605.3 million in the same quarter last year, as its performance continued to be affected by foreign steel producers' dumping activities, as the measures imposed by the authorities are generally seen as ineffective. Lion Corp expects the operating environment to remain tough in the coming quarter, if no effective measures are undertaken by the government to curb dumping activities, which would cause local steel producers to continue to suffer. However, it said, the announcement by the government in September 2015 on the safeguard investigation augurs well for the group. C.I. Holdings Bhd saw its net profit for the first financial quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (1QFY16) jump 12 times to RM10.07 million or 6.21 sen per share from a year ago, due to the consolidation of the results of its 60%-owned subsidiary, Palmtop Vegeoil Products Sdn Bhd. The group posted a profit of RM846,000 or 0.52 sen per share in the corresponding quarter last year, its filing to Bursa today showed. For the same reason, revenue surged to RM260.09 million from RM87.54 million in 1QFY15. JCY International Bhd's net profit in its fourth quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (4QFY15) surged a little over 4.5 times to RM75.6 million or 3.7 sen per share compared to RM16.5 million or 0.81 sen per share in the same quarter last year, driven by a stronger US dollar against the ringgit. Revenue inched up 0.75% to RM465.9 million in 4QFY15 compared to RM462.4 million last year due to lower sales volume. It declared a fourth interim dividend of three sen per share, bringing its full year's dividend to 6.75 sen versus 4.25 sen in FY14. Net profit for FY15 came in 91% higher at RM209.5 million from RM109.9 million in FY14. Revenue improved by 4.02% to RM1.94 billion compared with RM1.87 billion in FY14. Oriental Interest Bhd's net profit for the first quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (1QFY16) more than tripled to RM9.75 million or 10.77 sen per share from RM2.59 million or 2.86 sen per share driven by its property development and general construction segment. The improvement in performance was mainly contributed by a surge of 109% and 353% in progress billings and pre-tax profit respectively from property development, with much improved project margin, it said. A hike of 79% and 88% in total billings and pre-tax profit respectively from general construction has also lifted its earnings for the quarter. Revenue almost doubled to RM67.13 million from RM34.13 million in 1QFY15. Zelan Bhd registered a 75.9% increase in net profit for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3QFY15) to RM23.45 million from RM13.33 million a year ago, largely due to a RM26 million provision write-back and a RM15.9 million tax refund. The write-back was on its provision for late payment interest charge on tax in Indonesia, while the tax refund was on tax paid in Indonesia. Also contributing to the better results was a RM1.8 million tax refund from India, and higher unrealised forex gain of RM10.3 million, its filing on Bursa today showed. Revenue for the quarter rose 49.1% to RM94.03 million from RM63.1 million in 3QFY14, contributed mostly by local projects as well as the Meena project in Abu Dhabi. For the nine-month period (9MFY15), net profit rose 34.08% y-o-y to RM49.02 million while revenue rose 48.4% to RM297.13 million. Despite lower CPO prices and weaker hospital profit, TDM Bhd saw its net profit for the third financial quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3QFY15) surge 59% to RM12.05 million or 0.81 sen per share from RM7.6 million or 0.51 sen per share a year earlier on deferred taxes. In a filing with Bursa today, the plantation and healthcare player said its revenue inched up 0.3% to RM98.57 million versus RM98.31 million in 3QFY14. During 3QFY15, TDM registered deferred tax of RM342,000 versus tax expenses of RM6.42 million. For the nine-month period (9MFY15), net profit halved to RM17.52 million from RM36.81 million a year earlier. Revenue fell 6.35% to RM268.27 million from RM286.47 million a year ago. Malakoff Corp Bhd's net profit jumped 44.3% to RM156.02 million or 3.12 sen per share for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3QFY15), from RM108.13 million or 3.02 sen per share a year ago, thanks to lower losses recorded by its associate company Kapar Energy Ventures Sdn Bhd and lower finance costs, following the redemption of its sukuk from its initial public offering (IPO) proceeds. Revenue for 3QFY15 fell 9.2% to RM1.28 billion, from RM1.41 billion a year ago on lower capacity factor registered by its gas-fired and coal-fired power plants and the scheduled outages taken by certain plants, as part of its maintenance requirement. The independent water and power producing company recommended an interim dividend of two sen, totalling RM100 million for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2015 (FY15), payable on Dec 28. For the nine-month period (9MFY15), Malakoff's net profit gained 51.7% to RM346.21 million or 7.91 sen per share, from RM228.86 million or 6.39 sen per share in 9MFY14. Revenue slid 4.4% to RM3.93 billion, from RM4.11 billion a year earlier. Pos Malaysia Bhd saw its net profit plunge 89.8% to RM3.48 million or 0.65 sen per share for its second financial quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (2QFY16) from RM33.99 million or 6.33 sen per share in 2QFY15. The national postal company attributed the lower earnings to the lower profits from mail and retail segments, caused by higher transportation cost for transhipment business and recognition of expired postal order in 2QFY15. However, revenue came in 7.3% higher at RM398.8 million from RM371.67 million a year ago, underpinned by its mail and retail segments, which registered an increase in turnover of 11% and 15.3% respectively during the quarter. For the first half of FY16 (1HFY16), Pos Malaysia posted a 57.1% decline in net profit to RM26.22 million or 4.88 sen per share from RM61.1 million or 11.38 sen per share a year ago due to the same reasons. Revenue for 1HFY16 gained 6.6% to RM789.17 million from RM740.46 million in 1HFY15. Going forward, Pos Malaysia said its revenue growth will be mainly driven by the growth in products and services related to e-commerce, namely courier, small packets and parcels products. Although the e-commerce growth trend is expected to have long-term potential, it pointed out that the softening near-term economic and market sentiments are expected to be challenging for the group's prospects. Property developer and theme park operator I-Bhd saw its net profit for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3QFY15) fall 39.9% to RM8.56 million, from RM14.24 million a year earlier, as revenue dropped 28.65% to RM55.22 million, compared with RM77.39 million a year ago. It told Bursa that its property development segment \\u2014 the group's biggest revenue contributor \\u2014 recorded lower sales and pre-tax profit because its ongoing developments were at their initial stages of construction. For the cumulative nine months (9MFY15), net profit fell 31.29% to RM27.31 million from last year's RM39.75 million. Going forward, I-Bhd expects its property development and leisure segments to continue contributing positively to its financials in FY15.

The downgrade reflects Alam Maritim\\u2019s weakened business risk profile arising from a tough operating environment for offshore support vessel (OSV) providers, said the local rating agency. \\u201cThe group\\u2019s operating performance has been affected by a decline in contract order book and lower charter rates for its vessels,\\u201d said MARC in a statement yesterday.

In a statement today, the credit rating agency said that it had reiterated its conclusion in its analysis of three Malaysian corporate sukuk which it rated in 2015, namely Axiata Group Bhd (Baa2 stable), Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) (A3 positive), and Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) (A1 stable). Moody's assistant vice president Nidhi Dhruv said that from a credit-risk perspective, these sukuk structures do not have any material asset-backed or equity features. \"As such, investors ultimately rely on the creditworthiness of the corporates backing the sukuk to ensure that all payment obligations are fulfilled,\" he said. He added that Moody's rates US$5 billion (RM21.56 billion) of sukuk instruments from Malaysia-based non-financial corporates as of November 2015, and all sukuk ratings are on par with the companies' respective senior unsecured ratings, reflecting the companies' underlying credit quality. Moody's analysis is contained in its just-released report Axiata, Petronas, TM: Sukuk Ratings Reflect Underlying Corporates' Credit Quality, co-authored by Dhruv as well as associate analysts Maisam Hasnain and Vincent Tordo. Both Hasnain and Tordo are Islamic finance specialists in Moody's corporate finance group. The report provides an overview of the factors it considers when analysing the credit quality of sukuk. \"The three sukuk we rated this year have similar structures whereby the underlying corporate sets up and manages a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to hold the assets and issue the sukuk. \"The SPV (on behalf of investors) also assigns the corporate as its agent. In this capacity, the agent is effectively responsible for using the sukuk proceeds to purchase the sukuk assets, manage the sukuk portfolio and pay associated cash flows,\" said Hasnain. Moody's further noted that additional structural features, which include the underlying corporates' flexibility in selecting sukuk assets, do not affect the credit quality of the sukuk. \"In line with its senior unsecured rating, Petronas' sukuk rating is higher than that of TM and Axiata, reflecting the company's fundamental credit quality, which is the strongest of the three owing to its low leverage and strong interest coverage,\" said Moody's. In its analysis, Moody's does not provide an opinion on the sukuk transactions' compliance with syariah. \"Compliance is a subjective matter for the parties involved, who rely on the endorsement of a recognised board of syariah experts,\" said Moody's.

Its executive director Mohd Imran Mohamad Salim said MRCB intends to undertake a de-gearing exercise this year, but did not say what it would do to pare down MRCB's debt-to-equity level. The RM1.6 billion construction value of the project is pegged to the 92.5-acre land that it will receive as compensation for the job.

Revenue for the quarter came in 19.2% lower at RM436.25 million, from RM539.79 million in 3QFY14, mainly driven by its marine business segment, which saw higher on-year revenue \\u2014 and operating profit \\u2014 due to higher value for vessels repaired.

Going forward, MMHE said the downturn in upstream O&G industry is expected to be protracted and this adverse market scenario will impact its offshore business unit, but its marine segment is anticipated to remain strong and cushion the downturn's impact somewhat.

South Australian Deputy Premier John Rau was reported as saying that the next step was requests for proposals from the shortlisted developers. The developers are to come up with schemes to transform the existing 275,000 sq m of buildings into a project that could rival elements of Sydney's Barangaroo precinct, another site undergoing an urban transformation which is expected to be completed in 2023. National oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) is injecting three companies that are currently undertaking petrochemical works at its RM60 billion Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) project in Johor into Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd (PetChem) for RM13,000. Following that, the chemical arm of Petronas will assume the assets and liabilities of the three companies, which amount to approximately US$110 million (RM470.52 million). PetChem, which is 64.35%-owned by Petronas, is acquiring the units from Petronas Refinery and Petrochemical Corporation Sdn Bhd (PRPC), a wholly-owned unit of Petronas. \"The payment for the paid up capital in the companies of RM13,000 is expected to be paid to PRPC on Nov 3, 2015, while the liabilities of the companies of US$110 million is expected to be settled by the respective companies before the end of the year,\" said PetChem in an announcement to Bursa Malaysia today. The three companies are currently working on petrochemical projects with a future total investment cost of about US$3.9 billion (RM16.68 billion), with a combined total capacity of approximately 2.7 million tonnes per annum (2.7 mtpa), it added. Following the acquisition, PetChem said the three companies will become its wholly-owned subsidiaries. However, the chemical products manufacturer said there may be a potential dilution to its equity in the project companies, based on current arrangements between PRPC and its existing partners \\u2014 but did not elaborate. PetChem said the transaction does not have any effect on its issued and paid up share capital, nor its earnings or the net assets at the transaction date of Nov 3. \"The [three companies'] project(s) are expected to contribute positively to both future revenue and earnings,\" it added. Tasek Corp Bhd's third quarter net profit fell from a year earlier as the cement manufacturer lowered selling prices amid costlier raw materials. Tasek told Bursa Malaysia today that the group's net profit fell to RM18.04 million in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3QFY15) from RM21.47 million. Revenue was higher at RM165.57 million versus RM148.68 million in 3QFY14, mainly due to higher sales volume registered by both cement and ready-mixed concrete divisions. Tasek said cumulative 9MFY15 net profit fell to RM72.79 million from RM77.49 million a year earlier. Revenue was higher at RM514.11 million compared to RM483.09 million in 9MFY14. Despite lower 3QFY15 profit, Tasek plans to pay a dividend of 20%, which translates into 20 sen a share. The ex-date falls on Nov 18.

Hibiscus Petroleum Bhd, which was slapped with an UMA query by Bursa Malaysia earlier today, said some shareholders may be subject to margin calls on shares that have been collateralised and are being asked to regularise their margin positions. Aside from that and two drilling programmes undertaken by its jointly-controlled Norwegian entity and Australian unit, the O&G player said it was not aware of any other possible explanation for the sudden fall in its share price.

Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd (F&N) saw its net profit for the fourth quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (4QFY15) fall 8.8% to RM56.7 million or 15.5 sen per share from RM62.2 million or 17 sen per share in the same period last year, on weaker performance in its soft drinks segment. Quarterly revenue, however, came in 3.7% higher at RM1 billion from RM964.52 million a year ago, underpinned by better revenue from its dairies operations in both Malaysia and Thailand. The dairy products and soft drinks manufacturer proposed a 35.5 sen dividend for the current quarter under review, payable on Feb 4, 2016, bringing its full-year dividend to 57.5 sen per share. For the full year (FY15), its net profit rose 8% to RM280.07 million against RM259.43 million last year, due to higher revenue and lower milk-based commodity cost during the year. Revenue grew 6.3% on year to RM4.06 billion from RM3.82 billion in FY14, due to strong revenue growth from its dairies operations in both Malaysia and Thailand, which registered an increase of 3% and 17.7% respectively. Going forward, F&N expects to see challenging trading conditions in both Malaysia and Thailand against a softer consumer sentiment \\u2014 which would manifest in intense price competitions \\u2014 and volatile currency exchange rates.

Revenue for the quarter came in 19.2% lower at RM436.25 million, from RM539.79 million in 3QFY14, mainly driven by its marine business segment, which saw higher on-year revenue \\u2014 and consequently operating profit \\u2014 due to higher value for vessels repaired.

Bursa Malaysia is advising investors to exercise caution in the trading of the shares of XOX Bhd after the recent spike in the mobile operator\\u2019s share price. The regulator also drew investors\\u2019 attention to the company\\u2019s responses to the unusual market activity (UMA) queries issued by Bursa Malaysia on Oct 5, 2015 and Oct 26, 2015, which confirmed it was not aware of any corporate development or explanation that could give rise to the unusual trading activities in its securities. Nevertheless, Bursa advised investors to exercise caution and to make informed decisions in the trading of XOX\\u2019s shares. XOX\\u2019s shares hit a high of 34.5 sen after going up as much as 11.29% today, before paring gains. After Bursa\\u2019s caution at 3.02pm, XOX pared gains to trade at 29 sen, down two sen or 6.45%, after some 118.01 million shares changed hands, making it the most actively-traded counter on the bourse today. Meanwhile, a 20% rise in Lay Hong Bhd\\u2019s share price over the past three days has prompted Bursa Securities to issue an UMA query to the poultry egg producer. Bursa, via a filing today, requested Lay Hong to furnish any known information over any unannounced corporate development or rumour that could have led to the recent sharp rises in its share price and trading volume. Today alone, Lay Hong\\u2019s shares closed 70 sen or 12.07% higher at a new all-time high of RM6.50 with 342,400 shares traded. The company is now valued at RM303.6 million.

PetDag has therefore declared a higher interim dividend of 14 sen per share for the quarter \\u2014 payable on Dec 4 \\u2014 compared to the 12 sen declared for the same period last year. In its quarterly Bursa Malaysia disclosure today, PetDag said its revenue for the quarter dipped by 20.63% to RM6.53 billion from RM8.23 billion in the previous corresponding quarter, largely as a result of a decrease in average selling price and sales volume. PetDag\\u2019s cumulative nine-month (9MFY15) profit rose 39.26% to RM697.86 million from RM501.13 million last year. Its cumulative revenue fell 23.16% to RM19.12 billion from RM24.89 billion. Destini Bhd posted a 66% rise in third quarter net profit from a year earlier as the aviation maintenance, repair and operations specialist\\u2019s revenue jumped 130%.

Top Glove Corp Bhd expects to conclude at least one acquisition in the fiscal year through August as the Malaysian company seeks to maintain record earnings momentum. Bloomberg reported that the world\\u2019s biggest rubber-glove maker is targeting rivals as well as manufacturers of condoms and catheters and will raise as much as RM1 billion in bank loans to spend on acquisitions, Top Glove chairman Lim Wee Chai said in an interview on Thursday. The company is working with banks including HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co on potential deals, he said. The company is making acquisitions a priority to sustain growth after profit more than doubled in the last quarter. \\u201cIn order to continue to grow, it is very important for us to do M&As (mergers and acquisitions),\\u201d said Lim in the interview. \\u201cBig or small, we will be interested as long as it is relevant and suitable,\\u201d he added. Special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Sona Petroleum Bhd plans to buy Australia\\u2019s Stag Oilfield for US$50 million (RM215.2 million), and the transaction is also intended to be the SPAC\\u2019s qualifying acquisition. Sona Petroleum said in a filing today that its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Sona E&P (Perth) Pty Ltd (Sona Australia) will serve as the buyer, and Sona Petroleum as guarantor for the sale and purchase agreement with Quadrant Northwest Pty Ltd and Santos Offshore Pty Ltd, whom are the sellers. The agreement entails Sona Australia acquiring 100% interest in the production license WA-15-L and pipeline license WA-6-PL and the associated assets, collectively known as the Stag Oilfield, along with the operatorship of the oilfield. The Stag Oilfield is a producing oilfield located in the Dampier sub-basin of the Carnarvon Basin, offshore Western Australia and in a water depth of approximately 50 metres and approximately 60 kilometres offshore. It was discovered in 1993 and commenced production in 1998. As at June 30, 2015, the Stag Oilfield was producing oil at the rate of 4,600 barrels per day from 10 active wells. The agreement is expected to be completed by March 31, 2016, subject to approval from the Securities Commission Malaysia and the shareholders of Sona Petroleum for the acquisition, as well as notice of no objection from the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board. The acquisition will be funded entirely in cash via funds raised from the initial public offering (IPO) held under a trust account amounting to approximately RM525.6 million as at Oct 30, 2015. The group is also proposing to utilise part of the IPO funds for the infill development of the Stag Oilfield. Icon Offshore Bhd has appointed Amir Hamzah Azizan as its new managing director effective March 1, 2016. He will also be appointed to the board of the oil and gas service provider.

KNM Group Bhd has fixed the issue price for its proposed private placement of up to 193.89 million shares at 50 sen per share. In a filing with Bursa today, KNM said the issue price represents a discount of 6% to the five-day volume weighted average price of the shares up to and including Oct 30, being the last full trading day immediately prior to the price fixing date, of 53 sen per share. On Oct 21, the company had proposed to undertake a placement of up to 10% of its issued share capital to be placed to third party investor(s). Based on the issue price of 50 sen, the exercise would raise RM96.95 million. The group intends to use the proceeds raised from the proposed placement to repay borrowings and for working capital. FSBM Holdings Bhd\\u2019s auditor has issued a qualified opinion on its audited financial statements for the financial year ended June 30, 2015 (FY15). This was due to the external auditor not being able to ascertain whether RM8.66 million in trade and other receivables of the group due from Technitium Sdn Bhd is recoverable. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, FSBM noted that its external auditor Messrs Ernst & Young said that included in trade and other receivables to its FY15 financial statements is an amount due from Technitium of RM7.61 million (RM33.74 million less impairment amount of RM26.13 million) and RM1.05 million (RM8.77 million less impairment amount of RM7.73 million) respectively. \\u201cThe directors have commenced certain debt recovery legal proceedings and are of the view that the carrying amount is recoverable. Accordingly, the balance of the carrying amount was not impaired as at reporting date. \\u201cHowever, as the outcome of the various debt recovery legal proceedings cannot be ascertained at this point of time, we are unable to satisfy ourselves as to whether the above carrying amount is recoverable,\\u201d said Ernst & Young in its audit report. Kamal Abdul Aziz, one of the newly appointed executive directors of Wintoni Group Bhd who joined its board on Sept 10, has resigned from his post with the industrial automation systems provider. In a filing with the exchange today, the 45-year-old director, who is also a full-time stock trader according to Wintoni\\u2019s filing in October, cited needing more time for his own business and to pursue other personal commitments as the reasons behind his resignation. Kama was appointed to the board following the en masse resignation of the former board of directors after 10 minority shareholders requisitioned for an extraordinary general meeting to remove the whole board in August. Following that, former chairman Datuk Khairuddin Mat Yusof, together with two executive directors, including Datuk Tey Por Yee, and four independent directors and CEO Choong Siew Meng, had all resigned. The company had then appointed former Agriculture and Agro-based Industry deputy minister Datuk Seri Mohd Shariff Omar, six directors and two executive directors, including Kamal, to the board.

It posted a net profit of RM418.63 million or 21.16 sen per share in the same period last year. Revenue for the quarter inched up 0.89% to RM1.13 billion, from RM1.12 billion in the previous year, driven by higher regasification revenue from higher storage fees and higher gas processing revenue, in line with the higher performance-based structure income. But these were partially offset by lower utilities revenue resulting from electricity tariff rebate given to customers, said PetGas in its filing to Bursa Malaysia today. Despite lower earnings, Petronas Gas declared a 15 sen dividend, payable on Dec 14 this year; it paid a 20 sen dividend last year. For the cumulative nine months (9MFY15), net profit came in 23.62% higher at RM1.57 billion or 79.49 sen per share, from RM1.27 billion or 64.28 sen per share in 9MFY14. Revenue for the cumulative period rose 1.22% to RM3.32 billion, from RM3.28 billion a year earlier. PetGas told the stock exchange that its profit before tax (PBT) was lower by RM133.7 million, as compared to last year, due to unrealised forex loss on financial lease liabilities totalling RM167.5 milllion, following the weakening of the local note against the greenback. \\u201cExcluding impact of the forex, PBT increased by RM17.3 million or 3.1%,\" it added. It pointed out profit for the quarter decreased by RM111.4 million, in line with lower profit before taxation. However, excluding the impact of forex, profit for the quarter increased by RM39.6 million or 9.1%, contributed by higher revenue and other income, it said. Going forward, PetGas expects its performance for its gas processing, gas transportation and regasification segments in the current financial year ending Dec 31, 2015 (FY15), to remain stable. This is expected to come from the steady revenue generated from its gas processing, gas transportation and regasification services agreements signed with Petronas. \"Whilst performance for the utilities segment will continue to be driven by petrochemical customers' demand,\" it added. Shares in PetGas closed two sen or 0.09% lower at RM22.98 today, for a market capitalisation of RM45.47 billion.

Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB) has clinched two major jobs totalling RM4.78 billion and also announced it would be taking up a major role in the development of the Cyberjaya City Centre (CCC), which carries an estimated gross development of almost RM10 billion. The two jobs it won were: the development and construction of the Kwasa Utama commercial development worth RM3.15 billion, and the refurbishment and upgrading of facilities at the National Sports Complex in Bukit Jalil, Kuala Lumpur, worth RM1.63 billion. MRCB told Bursa Malaysia it had entered into a management contract with Kwasa Utama Sdn Bhd (KUSB), under which MRCB was appointed the management contractor for the development and construction of Kwasa Utama \\u2014 a 29.82 acre commercial development in the new Kwasa Damansara township in Sg Buloh. KUSB is 95%-owned by the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and the remaining 5% stake is held by Kwasa Land Sdn Bhd, which is wholly-owned by EPF. The 29.82-acre Kwasa Utama development, which will span over a period of 12 years from 2016 to 2027, is expected to comprise seven separate development plots. It will feature eight office towers, a hotel, an auditorium and a common facility block. As for the RM1.63 billion job to refurbish and upgrade the Bukit Jalil National Sports Complex into the Kuala Lumpur Sports City (KL Sports City), it will be repaid by the government with three pieces of leasehold land, totalling 92.5 acres nearby. The job was awarded to MRCB\\u2019s Rukun Juang Sdn Bhd, which was chosen by the federal government for offering \\u201cthe best overall development concept\\u201d, after 11 companies submitted proposals in an open nation-wide tender, MRCB said in a statement this evening. The upgrading project will be undertaken in two phases; the first is to get the national stadium ready to host the 2017 Southeast Asia Games. The second phase will commence once the SEA games are over and will create KL Sports City, a fully-integrated sports hub with, among others, world-class infrastructre and a sports-focused mall. Phase 1 is to be completed in 18 months and will begin one week after the necessary approvals are obtained. Phase 2 \\u2014 to begin no later than Jan 1, 2018 \\u2014 is slated to complete in three years. Lastly, MRCB\\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary MRCB Land Sdn Bhd is expected to fork out RM269.5 million for a 70% stake in CSB Development Sdn Bhd, the joint venture company (JVC) that will undertake the development of CCC. It said MRCB Land has entered into a joint venture agreement with Cyberview Sdn Bhd, a government-owned company wholly-owned by the Minister of Finance for the development. Cyberview will take up the remaining 30% in CSB Development for RM115.5 million. Cyberview, mandated by the Malaysian government to spearhead the development of Cyberjaya, has earmarked approximately 141.27 acres of land located in Cyberjaya for development of the CCC. Property developer Eastern & Oriental Bhd (E&O) has awarded RM2.32 billion worth of land reclamation works to Chinese contractor China Communications Construction Co Ltd (CCCC) for the proposed Seri Tanjung Pinang Phase 2 (STP2) project in Penang. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, E&O said its subsidiary Tanjung Pinang Development Sdn Bhd has issued a letter of award (LOA) to CCCC's Malaysian unit China Communications Construction Co (M) Sdn Bhd (CCCC (M)) to undertake the proposed project. The LOA serves primarily as an acceptance of the tender to reclaim Phase 2A of STP2, an area measuring 384 acres which includes the 131-acre Gurney Drive foreshore (Package 1), for a contract sum of RM1.035 billion, with works to be completed within two years and five months from the acceptance of the LOA. The LOA also includes the conditional award for the proposed land reclamation works for the remainder of STP2, made up of Phase 2B and Phase 2C covering an area of 507 acres (Package 2), with a contract sum of RM1.285 billion. Maxis Bhd said its third quarter and nine-month revenue rose from a year earlier, as the mobile telecommunication network provider secured more prepaid subscribers. In a statement to Bursa Malaysia, Maxis said revenue in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3QFY15) rose 5% to RM2.17 billion, from RM2.07 billion; while net profit, however, fell 6% to RM420 million, from RM449 million. Cumulative 9MFY15 net profit declined to RM1.27 billion, from RM1.38 billion a year earlier; while revenue was higher at RM6.43 billion versus RM6.27 billion in 9MFY14. The company said year-to-date, service revenue grew 4% to RM6.379 billion, driven by the strong performance of the prepaid segment. Prepaid service revenue grew 7.2% to RM3.143 billion, whilst post-paid service revenue was relatively stable at RM2.92 billion. However, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (Ebitda) fell to RM3.17 billion, from RM3.23 billion, due to unrealised foreign exchange losses from the weakening ringgit and higher staff costs largely due to a non-recurring reversal made in the same period last year, which was partially offset by lower prepaid service tax. Maxis proposed a dividend of five sen a share for 3QFY15. The ex-date falls on Nov 26 this year. Looking ahead, Maxis said it expects low single-digit service revenue growth in FY15, while Ebitda is seen at similar levels, compared to a year earlier. MISC Bhd\\u2019s wholly-owned unit AET Inc Ltd has commissioned the construction of eight new vessels for approximately US$500 million. In a statement, MISC said AET signed shipbuilding contracts today with Samsung Heavy Industries Co Ltd, for the construction of four new 113,000 dead weight tonnes (DWT) Aframax vessels, which are slated for delivery in 2018. The company inked similar contracts with Hyundai Heavy Industries Co Ltd for the construction of two new 114,000 DWT long range 2 (LR2) product vessels, and two new 158,000 DWT Suezmax vessels. These four are to be delivered to AET in 2017. The combined value of the shipbuilding contracts are approximately US$500 million. The two LR2 product vessels are tied to long term time charters, which has been awarded with a strategic oil major client, MISC said. The six other new vessels will replace older tonnage in the AET fleet, ensuring AET continues to deliver optimum solutions for its customers, it added. The vessel purchases will be funded by AET\\u2019s internally-generated funds and external borrowings. NCB Holdings Bhd, which is in the midst of a takeover attempt by its second largest shareholder MMC Corp Bhd, returned to profitability in its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3QFY15), with a net profit of RM10.89 million or 2.3 sen earnings per share, compared with a net loss of RM2.3 million or 0.5 sen loss per share in 3QFY14. The better earnings was driven by the higher revenue registered by the port operations, due to higher throughput handled for the current quarter under review, it told Bursa Malaysia in a filing. Revenue for 3QFY15 was 9.47% higher at RM218.41 million, from RM199.51 million in 3QFY14, on better container and conventional businesses and marine operations. For the cumulative nine months (9MFY15), NCB's net profit soared 460.5% to RM29.54 million or 6.3 sen per share from RM5.27 million or 1.1 sen per share in 9MFY14. Revenue for 9MFY5, however, was marginally lower by 0.38% at RM608.59 million against RM610.91 million a year ago. UMW Oil and Gas Corporation Bhd (UMWOG) has bagged a drilling rig services contract from Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd (PCSB) for an undisclosed value. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, UMWOG said its unit UMW Offshore Drilling Sdn Bhdhas received a letter of award from PCSB for the contract for the provision of a jack-up drilling rig, whereby UMW NAGA 7 has been assigned for the contract. The contract, which commenced on Oct 15, 2015, is for seven firm wells with extension option of one plus one well, and an estimated duration of minimum one month for each well, it added. UMW NAGA 7 is a premium independent-leg cantilever jack-up rig that has a drilling depth capability of 30,000 feet and has a rated operating water depth of 375 feet. Caring Pharmacy Group Bhd reported a 83.94% increase in its net profit for its first quarter ended Aug 31, 2015 (1QFY16) to RM1.02 million, from RM554,000 a year ago, due to the opening of a total 12 new outlets in FY15 and the recently-concluded quarter. The group reported a 4.7% increase in revenue to RM92.55 million for 1QFY16, from RM88.4 million last year. Looking forward, the group expects to perform profitably on the recent zero-rated medical items announced in Budget 2016, which may improve retail pharmacy market sentiment. Under Budget 2016, the government has announced that the number of zero-rated GST medicines has been doubled from 4,215 to 8,630. Sunway Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) will be able to pay higher non-taxable income distribution from the first quarter of its financial year ending June 30, 2016, onwards, after winning a judicial review that allows it to claim for industrial building allowance (IBA) for its properties. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, Sunway REIT said the entitlement came after the Inland Revenue Board (IRB) withdrew its appeal at the Court of Appeal against the High Court\\u2019s judgment, allowing the REIT to claim for IBA. The REIT said its manager Sunway REIT Management Sdn Bhd will compute income distribution by claiming IBA on its hotel properties from 1QFY16, which will result in a higher non-taxable income distribution to be paid. The REIT\\u2019s manager is currently liaising with IRB on the manner of refund to unitholders, as a result of the higher withholding tax amount paid to IRB in relation to the affected distributions.

It is understood that about eight companies, including some sizeable foreign firms, have expressed interest in MILS. \\u201cFor foreign companies, with the weak ringgit, they can buy the company (MILS) for cheap,\\u201d one source explains. The local currency has depreciated more than 20% against the US dollar this year, touching 4.1295 last Friday. Another industry player who is aware of the sale says there is no outright tender, but as MISC \\u2014 which has been on a divestment trail, disposing of its non-core assets \\u2014 is known to have wanted to sell the land transport business since last year, several parties are looking at the asset now. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not a formal bidding process but many parties are pursuing it (MILS),\\u201d he adds. MISC (fundamental: 1.20; valuation: 0.80) did not reply to The Edge\\u2019s email enquiry on the matter. Individuals and companies that are said to have expressed interest in MILS include tycoon Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Albukhary; Datuk Che Azizuddin Che Ismail, a former CEO and executive director of Konsortium Logistik Bhd; and Utusan Melayu (M) Bhd, in which Umno has a 49.77% stake. The price tag is said to be in the region of RM250 million. It is not clear which vehicle will be used by Syed Mokhtar to acquire MILS as the businessman has extensive presence in the logistics industry through his flagship companies, MMC Corp Bhd and DRB-Hicom Bhd. It is noteworthy that this is not the first time\\u00a0 Utusan Melayu has wanted to take over MILS. In March last year, the group, through Golden Age Logistics Sdn Bhd, entered into an agreement to buy MILS for RM250 million. The consideration was arrived at on a willing-buyer, willing-seller basis after taking into account MILS\\u2019 unaudited net assets of RM246.5 million as at Dec 31, 2013. But the deal fell through in January this year. Little-known Golden Age is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Utusan Printcorp Sdn Bhd, in which Utusan Melayu has a 40% stake. In an announcement to Bursa Malaysia, MISC said the deal was not completed as \\u201cGolden Age was not able to fulfil its obligations for completion as stipulated in the agreement for sales and purchase of shares dated March 21, 2014\\u201d. Insiders, however, say Utusan Melayu and its units were not able to raise the funds needed for the acquisition. As at end-June this year, Utusan Melayu\\u2019s cash balance stood at RM30.3 million while it had short-term borrowings of RM123.3 million and long-term debt of RM83.8 million. Meanwhile, MILS could be a prized asset for logistics firms as it is a registered vendor of parent company, Petronas, as well as a multimodal transport operator. It is worth noting that the previous deal with Golden Age was conditional upon the receipt of a letter of undertaking, or letter of confirmation, from Petronas stating that the national oil firm plus its subsidiaries and associate companies would not terminate any current contract that they might have with MILS, or any licence granted by them to MILS, by reason of the change in shareholding in MILS, from MISC to Golden Age. However, it is not known if MISC will have such a condition in the new deal. Before the haulage market was liberalised some 15 years ago, MILS had been one of the five companies given the requisite licence to operate haulage trucks. The others were Konsortium Logistik; Diperdana Holdings Bhd, which has been taken over by Konsortium Logistik; Kontena Nasional Bhd, which is wholly owned by port operator NCB Holdings Bhd; and Multimodal Freight Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Keretapi Tanah Melayu Bhd. The sale of MILS for RM250 million may not be a sizeable transaction for MISC, which has a market capitalisation of RM39.5 billion. But it would add to its coffers, which currently hold RM4.63 billion. With the divestment of MILS, MISC would move closer to becoming an energy carrier. As at June 30, the shipping giant had RM1 billion worth of assets held for sale. While on the divestment trail, MISC sold off its loss-making bulk carrier and liner operation as well as a 36.8% stake in Affin Merchant Bank Bhd. In 2004, MISC hived off 15 bulk carriers to Thailand\\u2019s Precious Shipping PCL for US$98 million and sold 32 more bulk carriers to Greece\\u2019s Restis group for some US$740 million, exiting the business. MISC decided to leave the liner business in November 2011 after racking up US$789 million in losses over three consecutive financial years. At end-2012, the company sold its 50% stake in Gumusut-Kakap Semi-Floating Production System (L) Ltd to E&P Venture Solutions Co Sdn Bhd, a unit of Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd, for RM934.4 million. MISC also sold its 15.7% stake in NCB Holdings to Syed Mokhtar\\u2019s MMC for RM222 million in December last year. Just two months ago, the shipping giant disposed of its 50% stake in VTTI BV for US$830 million or some RM3.4 billion.

The KL Construction Index closely tracked the FBM KLCI Index over the past one year to close at 275.9 points last week, down 5.92% year on year. In contrast the benchmark index has lost 5.66% y-o-y to close at 1,706.54 points last Friday. But the construction sector is unlikely to see a sharp slowdown in jobs simply because of expectations that the government would have to continue infrastructure building in order to sustain economic growth. Indeed, there is an an estimated RM240 billion worth of projects in the pipeline. (see Table 1) The government\\u2019s pump priming efforts to lift the domestic economy out of the 1997/98 financial crisis put in place the foundations for some of the biggest blue-chips in the stock market. But some quarters have their reservations about the government\\u2019s ability to spend. \\u201cRumours are for an increase in development expenditure, although I struggle to see where that will come from. There could be more goodies for Sarawak ahead of the upcoming state elections and the usual Sarawakian construction counters will benefit,\\u201d says Chris Eng, head of research at Etiqa Insurance & Takaful. Major projects in the pipeline for Sarawak include the RM27 billion Pan-Borneo Highway as well as smaller projects like transmission lines and sewerage treatment plants. The Pan-Borneo Highway will have a lot of political hurdles to clear if it is to be executed, but it is one of the most lucrative since it would be fully funded by the government. Expected beneficiaries of the project include UEM Group Bhd, which is said to be taking a leading role in the project. And word in the industry is that Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar AlBukhary\\u2019s MMC Corp Bhd (fundamental: 1.10; valuation: 2.40) might no longer be involved. Sarawakian counters expected to be involved in the project include Cahya Mata Sarawak Bhd (CMS) (fundamental: 2.70; valuation: 0.50), Hock Seng Lee Bhd (fundamental: 2.40; valuation: 1.20), Shin Yang Shipping Corp Bhd (fundamental: 0.20; valuation 0.90) and Naim Holdings Bhd (fundamental: 1.20; valuation 1.80). Another major project that everyone in the industry is eyeing is the KL-Singapore High-Speed Rail (HSR). While there has been some doubt about whether the HSR would get moving anytime soon, the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD) and Singapore\\u2019s Land Transport Authority (LTA) last week issued a request for information (RFI) for the project. \\u201cThe RFI caught many players in the industry by surprise. SPAD and LTA did not give any indication that they would issue an RFI so soon. The RFI is just a way for them [SPAD and LTA] to gauge industry interest in the project. Realistically, contracts won\\u2019t be awarded till 2017,\\u201d says one industry executive who plans to bid for the project. Given the sheer scale of the project, however, the civil works are likely to be broken into many smaller packages and many construction counters could get a slice of the action. Interestingly, the RFI submissions can be sent separately to both SPAD and LTA, says the industry executive. \\u201cAt this stage, why can\\u2019t the RFIs be sent to a single project management company jointly controlled by LTA and SPAD? Do they still have some issues to sort out, or was the RFI rushed? Either way, it doesn\\u2019t inspire confidence that the project will get moving anytime soon,\\u201d the executive says. More importantly, funding was specifically mentioned as one of the criteria that SPAD and LTA are looking for in the RFI, along with HSR design, construction, operations and maintenance. This has given rise to speculation that the RFI was also a way for SPAD and LTA to gauge private sector confidence in investing in the project. On that note, a lack of funding could be the main challenge going forward. There have been concerns surrounding Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u2019s (Petronas) US$16 billion Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (Rapid) in Pengerang, since the sharp fall of crude oil prices. While the project is unlikely to be scrapped, industry observers are expecting that Rapid will be rolled out at a slower pace and possibly on a smaller scale as well. That said, Petronas has still been awarding contracts for RAPID. The most recent was the RM489 million contract awarded to Mudajaya Group Bhd (fundamental: 0.35; valuation: 0.90) to construct a workers village and temporary construction facilities for the utilities, interconnecting and off-site facilities. It is notable that the contracts will also flow down to subcontractors. For example, Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd (fundamental: 1.10; valuation 0.80) earlier this year secured a RM158.2 million job from Toyo Thai Malaysia Sdn Bhd for works related to the steam cracker complex. \\u201cAs long as there are no major cuts in the development budget it should be good for the sector. The Rapid project has been coming along, contrary to earlier expectations that works would be slow. At the same time, Putrajaya jobs are still carrying on,\\u201d says Eng who is \\u201coverweight\\u201d on the sector. One project that seems to have hit a funding speed bump is the KL118 development under Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB). UEM Group, together with South Korea\\u2019s Samsung, are reported to be front runners for the project and industry sources say PNB recently put the project on hold for 90 days, although the groundworks for the skyscraper are already underway. On the bright side, both the third light rapid transit (LRT) line and the second mass rapid transit (MRT) line are not expected to be delayed. Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB) (fundamental: 1.30; valuation: 2) and George Kent (M) Bhd (fundamental: 2.10; valuation: 0.80) were recently appointed project delivery partners (PDP) for the LRT line 3. Meanwhile, it is understood that packages for MRT line 2 will begin tendering in the next few weeks. The PDP for MRT line 2 is Gamuda Bhd (fundamental: 1.30; valuation: 1.40) and MMC Corp. As for the highways, only the Kidex highway seems to be stalled indefinitely, whereas long-delayed projects like the Damansara-Shah Alam Elevated Expressway (DASH) and the Sungai Besi-Ulu Kelang Elevated Expressway (SUKE) finally seem to be gaining traction with the pre-qualifying process under way. IJM Corp Bhd (fundamental: 1.30; valuation: 1.80), Sunway Construction Group Bhd (fundamental: NA; valuation: NA), MRCB, Mudajaya and UEM Group have been shortlisted in the pre-qualifiers for DASH and SUKE. Other highways that are expected to kick off in the near term are the Maju Expressway (MEX) extension and the Damansara Ulu Kelang Expressway (DUKE) extension, DUKE 3. After getting approval from the Economic Council over one year ago, the MEX extension is now pending the approval of UKAS \\u2014 the Public Private Partnership Unit. Meanwhile Ekovest Bhd\\u2019s (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 1.40) DUKE 3, is also in the process of finalising the alignment of the highway with UKAS. But how much of these projects are already priced into construction stocks? Since the start of the year, some construction stocks have taken a beating in line with the selldown on the broader market. The big-cap construction stocks, in particular, haven\\u2019t performed very well. Part of the reason was due to some of their exposure to the property development sector. Affin Hwang Asset Management Bhd head of Equity Strategies and Advisory Gan Eng Peng is less convinced about the sector\\u2019s prospects going forward. \\u201cThere will be more money for infrastructure projects, but it is not expected to be very big. The fiscal deficit is very close to the limit and with contingent liabilities, it is well over the limit. I don\\u2019t see how the budget will be a magic bullet for the sector,\\u201d says Gan. \\u201cThe major construction companies are already very big and they have lots of huge projects under their belt. Take Gamuda, for example. A new RM1 billion project would only add 5 sen to 10 sen to its value. It would take very big contracts to get people excited about these stocks and I don\\u2019t see that happening. Perhaps with the high-speed rail, but that is a few years off,\\u201d says Gan, who is more focused on the big-cap construction stocks. \\u201cLet\\u2019s say they [construction companies] are very big but cheap, that would be worth looking at. But they are very big and they are not cheap,\\u201d he adds. Gamuda, for example, saw its share price fall on foreign sell-offs back in August, despite announcing that it had been selected as the PDP for Penang\\u2019s Transport Master Plan worth RM27 billion. By the same token, Eng, who is \\u201coverweight\\u201d on the sector, names IJM Corp, Mitrajaya Holdings Bhd (fundamental: 1.50; valuation: 2) and Protasco Bhd (fundamental: 0.75; valuation: 1.20) as his top picks. Other stocks that might be worth watching include the purer construction plays like Kimlun Corp Bhd (fundamental: 1.70; valuation: 2.60) or stocks with a political angle like CMS, which have seen strong trading interest. Otherwise, stocks that look cheap (see Table 2) include Gadang Holdings Bhd (fundamental: 1.70; valuation: 3), which is trading at less than six times earnings. Gadang, which has been able to get jobs in the previous MRT line, could be a beneficiary of the second line.

Palm oil conglomerate IOI Corp Bhd expects a 10% fall in fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production due to the current El-Nino effect and the ongoing haze that has blanketed the region, but said this would provide support for crude palm oil (CPO) prices. IOI Corp chief executive officer Datuk Lee Yeow Chor said the group is entering seasonal low production period, and that the El-Nino effect and haze has further weighed down production. This has prompted the group to lower its full year FFB production growth forecast to 3%\\u20135%, from 5%\\u20137% previously. Nevertheless, Lee said he does not see negative impact to IOI Corp\\u2019s profitability, adding there is a good chance for CPO prices to go up, when the inventory is declining. After the group\\u2019s annual general meeting and extraordinary general meeting today, he told reporters he reckoned CPO prices to likely stabilise at the current level until the end of the year, whilst having the potential to rise further in the first quarter of next year.

Revenue for 3QFY15 also increased 5.3% to RM1.22 billion, from RM1.16 billion in 3QFY14, driven by growth in domestic sales, led by new product launches and the successful \\u2018Lagi Sihat, Lagi Happy\\u2019 consumer campaign, as well as improvements in its export business. The group declared a second interim dividend of 65 sen per share, amounting to RM152.43 million for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2015 (FY15), payable on Dec 2. For the nine-month period (9MFY15), Nestle Malaysia\\u2019s net profit rose 8.6% to RM490.94 million or 209.36 sen a share, from RM452.08 million or 192.78 sen a share in 9MFY14. However, it saw a marginal 1.6% decline in revenue to RM3.64 billion in 9MFY15, from RM3.7 billion in 9MFY14. Milux Corp Bhd, which announced its property diversification last week, said today that its maiden property development in Pahang has been revised to five condominium blocks with retail and club facilities, instead of the six blocks that were originally planned. The home appliance maker said the estimated gross development value (GDV) of the project is RM2.13 billion, while its gross development cost (GDC) is estimated at RM1.05 billion. Last week, Milux announced it is partnering RGF Cabaran Sdn Bhd (RCSB) to jointly develop 12 pieces of land, measuring 25,832.31 sq m in Bentong, Pahang, into a residential property, consisting of condominiums. On Monday (Oct 18), it told the exchange that the development would consist of six condominium blocks, with construction expected to begin in June 2017 and complete in December 2020. Public Bank Bhd reported a 0.8% rise in its third quarter net profit at RM1.2 billion, from a year earlier, on higher net interest, besides fee and commission income. Foreign exchange gains also supported bottom line growth. Public Bank said its net profit in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (3QFY15) of RM1.2 billion, was in comparison to RM1.19 billion previously. \\u201cThe improved earnings was mainly due to higher net interest income, higher foreign exchange income and higher net fee and commission income, partially offset by higher other operating expenses and higher loan impairment allowances,\\u201d Public Bank said. For the cumulative nine months (9MFY15), net profit rose to RM3.57 billion, from RM3.26 billion a year earlier. Revenue was higher at RM14.25 billion, versus RM12.33 billion. As at Sept 30, Public Bank said gross loans rose 12.9% to RM268 billion, from RM237.5 billion a year earlier. Customers\\u2019 deposits climbed 10.4% to RM296.3 billion.

SATS plans to pay the RM218 million to Brahim's in two portions. Brahim's said the first RM110 million portion would be paid upon completion of the transaction. The remaining RM108 million is conditional upon certain financial targets being met, according to Brahim's.\n\\u00a0TAS Offshore Bhd saw its net profit soar 60% to RM8.73 million for the first quarter ended Aug 31, 2015, from RM5.45 million in the previous year, due to foreign exchange gains. However, the company's 1Q revenue dropped 1% to RM75.5 million, from RM76.3 million a year ago, according to its filing on Bursa Malaysia today. The increase in profit was due to gain on foreign exchange recorded during the current quarter, as the US dollar and Singapore dollar strengthened, the company said. The company expects demand for both platform support vessels and anchor handling tug supply vessels to remain weak in the short term, but it remains cautiously optimistic in the long term, that oil price will recover. Fidelity Investments (FMR LLC), one of the largest mutual fund and financial services groups in the world, has emerged as a substantial shareholder in glovemaker Supermax Corp Bhd, with a 5.13% stake.

This translated into an earnings per share (EPS) of 1.72 sen in its latest quarter, compared to 2.33 sen in 2QFY15. Revenue was down 14.12% at RM121.41 million, from RM141.37 million a year earlier, according to its announcement to Bursa Malaysia today. Nevertheless, the pipes and fittings manufacturer, which primarily serves the oil and gas (O&G) industry, has declared a second interim dividend of 0.6 sen per share for its FY16, payable on Jan 14; the ex-date is on Dec 18. Pantech said the weaker sales performance was mainly due to weaker demand delivery in local and overseas O&G sector, while more competitive pricing has caused its profit to shrink. As for its six months ended Aug 31, 2015 (6MFY16), net profit fell 27.54% to RM19.55 million, from RM26.98 million in the same period last year, which caused its EPS to shrink to 3.23 sen, from 4.7 sen; revenue fell 4.41% to RM260.04 million, from RM272.05 million. Pantech's filing showed the weaker performance was caused by the decline in local and export demand, by both its trading and manufacturing divisions. Hua Yang Bhd's net profit for the second quarter ended Sept 30, 2015 (2QFY16) grew 10.4% year-on-year to RM28.69 million or 10.87 sen per share, from RM25.98 million or 9.84 sen a year ago, due to better performance from the property development segment. Revenue for the quarter increased 8% to RM150.62 million, from RM139.49 million in 2QFY15, its filing with Bursa Malaysia revealed today. For the cumulative six months (6MFY16), its net profit increased 17.4% to RM58.58 million or 22.19 sen per share, versus RM49.92 million or 18.91 sen per share in 6MFY15.

Alam Maritim Resources Bhd has bagged a RM53.5 million subcontract from Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas). In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, the company said its wholly-owned subsidiary, Alam Maritim (M) Sdn Bhd, received a letter of award from Petronas Floating LNG 1 (L) Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petronas, for the subcontract for the floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) offshore works of final positioning and mooring system hook-up, including flexible riser installation, pre-commissioning and commissioning of pipeline, pipeline end terminal and riser from KAKG to FLNG (Package No 2).

Tex Cycle Technology Malaysia Bhd, which saw its share price nearly hit a nine-year high today, said it is not aware of any reason that may have contributed to the recent sharp rally in its share price. In response to the unusual market activity (UMA) query issued by Bursa Malaysia earlier today, the recycling and recovery of scheduled waste specialist said it is not aware of any corporate development, rumour, report or explanation, to account for the sharp rise in its share price. However, it pointed out that its single largest shareholder Can Cycle Sdn Bhd, had on Oct 7 and Oct 19, sold a total of 10 million shares to institutional funds at RM1.20 a piece, for a total consideration of RM12 million.

In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Barakah said its wholly-owned subsidiary, PBJV Group Sdn Bhd, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Hilong Marine Engineering (Hong Kong) Ltd (HMEL), a subsidiary of Hilong Holding, for the team-up.

The scope of works entail the cover design, approval, build and delivery for Phase 1 of the project, which includes piling and pile caps for the entire project, all building, architectural and mechanical and electrical works.

In its filing with Bursa today, KNM said the placement entails the issuance of up to 193.89 million shares, representing approximately 10% of the issued share capital of the group. It added that the issue price of the placement shares will be determined and announced at a later date, after receiving the relevant approvals and having considered prevalent market conditions. Still, the issue price should not be a discount of more than 10% to the five-day volume weighted average price (VWAP) of KNM\\u2019s share price immediately prior to the price fixing date, and its par value of the shares of 50 sen. Assuming KNM manages to raise RM106.64 million, the group would use RM51 million (47.82%) for repayment of borrowings, RM52.66 million (49.38%) for working capital, and the remaining for expenses related to the proposed placement. \\u201cThe group requires additional working capital to fund the newly-secured projects, and potential additional contracts to be secured in relation to the Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex Project in Johor,\\u201d it said. As at June 30, 2015 (2QFY15), KNM\\u2019s total borrowings stood at RM676.38 million, of which RM392.4 million were short term loans and borrowings, with a gearing ratio of 0.29 times.

Year-to-date, the counter has seen a marginal 3.7% drop from RM1.474. Yesterday, WCT Holdings won a RM754.8 million contract from 1MDB Real Estate Sdn Bhd (1MDBRE) to build infrastructure and roadway works for the TRX. The two-year contract will cover underground road structures, installation of direct buried utilities, at-grade and elevated roadways, as well as associated earthworks, and mechanical and electrical works. This follows an earlier award of an earthwork contract package in 2013. The group's indirect wholly-owned unit WCT Precious Development Sdn Bhd also entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement with 1MDBRE's wholly-owned unit KLIFD Sdn Bhd to buy a 0.7ha freehold development land, forming part of the TRX, for RM223 million or about RM3,100 per sq ft (psf). WCT Holdings revealed that the proposed development comprises a tower block of high-end serviced apartments, with complimentary retail components at an estimated gross development value (GDV) of RM1.1 billion. Meanwhile, analysts raised or reiterated the stock calls to \"buy\" with a higher target price seeing that WCT Holdings' order book remained robust, sufficient to sustain the group for two years. \"WCT Holdings' outstanding order book remains robust at about RM3.4 billion from about RM2.6 billion previously, which is sufficient to sustain the group for two years. \"That said, WCT Holdings is still looking to secure more domestic jobs, such as from Petronas RAPID (Pengerang, Johor) works (RM1.0 billion), KL118 project in Kampung Attap, Kuala Lumpur (RM2 billion) and also West Coast Expressway (RM600 million),\" said Kenanga IB Research analyst Adrian Ng, adding that target price was increased to RM1.81 from RM1.42 in a note to clients. BIMB Securities Sdn Bhd retained a \"buy\" call with a 23.4% rise in target price to RM1.75 as it anticipated more domestic catalysts for the group next year. \"We anticipate there are still plenty of domestic catalysts for WCT Holdings with possible involvement in packages of Kwasa Damansara (township in Selangor) and RAPID which shall be awarded next year. \"Nevertheless, over a longer-term period, the group could be banking on its property development and investment projects with numerous developments are now on table and remaining GDV of about RM21.9 billion,\" it said in a note. CIMB Research analyst Sharizan Rosely upgraded the stock to \"add\" with a higher target price of RM1.63 as it has shown signs of long-awaited recovery of its construction division. \"We now believe that the recovery momentum for job flows has just begun, and could exceed expectations. WCT Holdings has shown signs of a long-awaited recovery of its construction division. \"We believe its appeal in the months ahead focuses on private sector jobs, which are largely due for awards in the medium term.

However, the rate hikes are expected to ease the cash flow of the companies, they added. In a note today, Hong Leong Investment Bank said the toll rate hikes are expected to have minimal earnings impact for most concessionaires as the companies were already receiving their stipulated rates contained in the concession agreements (CA) via compensation from the government. \"In essence, the hikes merely transfer the burden of the toll, which was previously shared between motorists and the government, solely to the motorist,\" the note read. \"Cash flows of concessionaires will nonetheless be eased as they no longer have to wait for compensation to be paid,\" it added. Yesterday, it was reported that toll rates across major highways will be increased between 20 sen and RM3 effective Oct 15. There have been no rate increases over the past seven years, with the government subsidising the stipulated rate hikes, Hong Leong Investment Bank said. Last November, the Malaysian government had reportedly staved off scheduled rate hikes this year and paid RM559 million in compensation to highway concessionaires to cover lower toll rates compared to the stipulated rates in the CA. Hong Leong Investment Bank also said the toll rate hikes will result in lower traffic volume over the affected major highways as motorists are hit with higher expenditure. \"Based on the experience from past hikes, our simple back of the envelop calculation suggests that every 10% toll rate increase would result to a 1% drop in traffic volume,\" the note read. \"However, given that the hike this time around is more widespread (ie previous hikes were very highway specific), the price elasticity of motorists could be higher,\" it added. The research firm maintained its \"overweight\" call on the construction sector. Hong Leong Investment Bank maintained its \"buy\" call and target price (TP) of RM5.01 for Gamuda Bhd, which holds a 45.5% stake in LDP concessionaire Lingkaran Trans Kota Holdings Bhd (Litrak) and a 50% stake in SMART. It also maintained its \"buy\" call and TP of RM3.92 on IJM Corporation Bhd, which owns the New Pantai Expressway (NPE) and Besraya Expressway as well as a 50% stake in Leburaya Kajang-Seremban (Lekas). In a note, MIDF Research said Litrak is expected to gain from the toll rate hikes across the Sprint highway rather than the LDP. This is because the revenue received by Litrak from the LDP is unchanged while a sharp increase (an average of 72%) in rates on the Sprint highway will flow directly to Litrak. \"We had not expected such a large increase and thus, revise our earnings contribution forecast upwards for SPRINT highway by 21.5% for financial year 2016 (FY16) and 43% for financial year 2017 (FY17),\" the note read. However, the research firm said a toll rate hike of about 30% to 50% is expected on the LDP highway next year, which will likely be subsidised by the government as the toll subsidy bill has now reduced sharply. MIDF Research reiterated its \"buy\" call on Litrak, with a higher TP of RM5.84 from RM5.07 on the back of higher contributions from Sprint highway and the expected rate hike on LDP highway from 2016 forward. Meanwhile, in a separate note, MIDF Research also said it was imperative that the government achieve a low budget deficit in the coming years, and it needed to cut back on operating expenditure that is deemed as \"inefficient\" for the economy. \"This is due to the fact that the low oil price \\u2014 which is expected to remain low for quite some time \\u2014 has caused a significant cutback in the government's revenue, and will most likely be reduced further next year due to the lower dividend payment by Petronas (Petroliam Nasional Bhd),\" the note read. \"Much of the cutback in operating expenditure is expected to be spent on development expenditure, which would provide higher multiplier impact to the economy while at the same time help to boost the economy in the midst of economic uncertainty,\" it added.

Back of the envelope calculation \\u2014 assuming current net margin of 7% (SKP is not exposed to forex movements) \\u2014 suggests an annual profit contribution of RM70 million. Add that to annualised 1QFY16 results, net profit would total some RM142 million \\u2014 meaning its FY17 P/E will drop to 10.4 times. Importantly, SKP has a long track record of paying out around 50% of annual profits as dividends. At this payout ratio, yield would rise from the current 1.4% to about 4.8%. Looking ahead, there is room for further growth. Including the latest contracts, its new plant in Senai is only 35% utilized. Note that its 1QFY16 earnings included contributions from three newly acquired subsidiaries from Tecnic Group, which was completed in March 2015. The subsidiaries produce commercial lubricant packaging and tool fabrication for clients including Petronas, Nestle and Unilever. The new businesses account for some 25-30% of SKP\\u2019s revenue and are expected to see steady 8-12% annual growth.

The TPP, in which Malaysia joins ranks with Vietnam, Singapore, Australia, the United States, Mexico, Canada and others, aims to liberalise trade and set common standards in these countries which produce 40% of global economic output. All member countries have up to two years to ratify the agreement. Malaysia\\u2019s International Trade and Industry Minister Datuk Seri Mustapa Mohamed, in a posting on his Facebook account last Tuesday, said that the contents of the agreement and a cost benefit analysis will be tabled in Parliament in two months, whereby Parliamentarians will debate and decide to agree or disagree to the TPP. While some quarters have argued that the TPP will offer developing countries like Malaysia and Vietnam greater access to markets across the world, others argue that it will open the door to biased arbitration favouring corporate interests above the government\\u2019s and restrict access to important goods such as cheaper medication. \\u00a0 Independent economist Lee Heng Guie said while increased market accessibility and lower tariff barriers will enhance trade, the extent to which the Malaysian government is willing to compromise on its interests in areas such as government procurement, affirmative action policies, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and investor state dispute settlement remains unclear.He said while consumers will see lower prices of goods and services as there will be varied influx in the domestic market, it will also compel companies here to increase the quality of their goods and services to gain access to markets such as the US, Canada and Australia. This follows various standards covering areas such as compliance, quality and sustainability implemented in these nations, he said. \\u201cCompetition is good because it will bring down prices,\\u201d he told The Edge Financial Daily. \\u201cAt the same time, it is a test for Malaysian exporters and companies in terms of compliance. \\u201cYou\\u2019re dealing with developed economies like the US and Canada, so it is not going to be easy,\\u201d he said. Lee expects the government to safeguard its interests from being weighed down by the TPP. The question is whether it will be effective,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAs for government procurement and SOEs, they \\u2014 besides Khazanah Nasional Bhd and Petronas (Petroliam Nasional Bhd) \\u2014 are created for the domestic market, so once they are open to competition with all these foreign players, in a way, it will lift up their standards as well,\\u201d he said. Referencing the term \\u201ccompetitive destruction\\u201d, Lee said the companies that are not able to keep up with quality, efficiency and productivity will be left behind grappling to secure its hold in the market. \\u201cAt the end of day, only the fittest will survive. It will force you to become more competitive, cost-efficient, productivity-driven rather than just relying on some protection to survive in the domestic market,\\u201d he said. Lee said the sectors that stand to benefit from the TPP agreement are electrical and electronics (E&E), rubber, palm oil, timber and automotive components due to lower tariffs on exports to US. However, Lee cautioned that Malaysia will not be able to compete with Vietnam in low-end, low-cost manufacturing industries such as textiles and to a certain extent, electronics. He also said the national cars may lose their market share due to increased competition posed by carmakers from the US. Furthermore, it is not clear what impact the pact will have on the National Automotive Policy. According to the Malaysian External Trade Development Corp, Malaysia\\u2019s total exports in 2014 amounted to RM1.45 trillion, an increase of 5.9% from RM1.37 trillion in 2013.Out of the total exports, 33.4% constituted E&E products at RM256.15 billion, followed by petroleum products at 9.2% (RM70.36 billion), liquefied natural gas at 8.4% (RM64.29 billion), chemicals and chemical products at 6.7% (RM51.51 billion), palm oil at 6.1% (RM46.95 billion) and crude petroleum at 4.4% (RM33.79 billion), among others. According to data from Bank Negara Malaysia, the US constituted 8.4% of Malaysia\\u2019s total exports in 2014, making it the country\\u2019s fourth largest trade partner.\\u00a0 Data from the US Census Bureau\\u2019s website shows that Malaysia\\u2019s exports to the US totalled US$30.42 billion in 2014, an increase of 11.47% from US$27.29 billion while imports were flat at US$13.07 billion in 2014 compared with US$13 billion in 2013. Meanwhile, CIMB Investment Bank Research analyst Saw Xiao Jun said in a note that although Malaysia has reportedly won concessions in several areas such as bumiputera\\u2019s interest and government procurement, the TPP poses a risk to all drug makers based in Malaysia. He said the Malaysian Medical Association had highlighted that the TPP agreement will extend the exclusivity period of new drugs, and generic drug producers may have to push back on new product launches which may dent their profit margins. \\u201cCurrently, generic drug makers rely on new product launches to offset the declining profit margin of older generic drugs,\\u201d he said. He also said the investment firm believes that government procurement and SOEs will be subjected to greater competition, and earnings could be at risk.\\u201cThe government is the key customer of state-owned drug makers such as Pharmaniaga Bhd and CCM Duopharma Biotech Bhd,\\u201d he said. \\u201cTheir manufacturing profit margins are higher than those of their peers and their earnings are at risk should competition intensify,\\u201d he added. MIDF Research had said last Tuesday in a note on the TPP agreement that member countries have reached a compromise on pharmaceutical patent protection of between five to eight years compared with US\\u2019 demand of 12 years. Saw also said while the TPP should reduce or remove the barriers to the export of drugs to other member countries, most local pharmaceutical companies are focused mainly on the domestic market. He said companies such as Hovid Bhd and Pharmaniaga that are eyeing international markets are looking to venture into Nigeria, the Philippines and Indonesia \\u2014 countries that are not part of the TPP. He also said Pharmaniaga derives most of its revenue from sales to the government and any changes in the government procurement policy poses a risk to its long-term earnings prospects. As for Hovid, Malaysia\\u2019s largest exporter of pharmaceutical products, the impact is slight as Hovid\\u2019s key export markets are not involved in the pact, he added. While the effects of the TPP will take years to manifest, he said the TPP agreement still poses a risk to the valuation of the pharmaceutical sector as it could alter its long-term prospects. As for consumers, Saw said longer patent protection will not result in higher prices for drugs but rather a longer waiting period for cheaper, generic drugs. CIMB has maintained a \\u201cneutral\\u201d call on the sector.\\u00a0 The research firm maintained its \\u201chold\\u201d call on both Hovid and Pharmaniaga, with a target price of 42 sen and RM6 respectively, with Hovid as its preferred stock. When contacted, an economist with a local bank, who requested anonymity, said ports are also expected to gain from the increased trading activities catalysed by the TPP, with Westports Holdings Bhd benefitting from it. However, he said it is still early days to ascertain a definite view on the impact of the TPP on other sectors as details of the TPP are sketchy."}, "421": {"date_posted": "9/10/2015", "title": "KLCI rises 1.02%, firmly above 1,700 level", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Oct 9): The FBM KLCI rose 1.02% at the midday break today, staying firmly above the 1,700-point level in line with the strong gains at regional markets.

The stock surged 10.3% to RM1.29 yesterday despite the absence of fresh corporate developments. Petra Energy is primarily involved in the provision of integrated brownfield maintenance and engineering services to the upstream O&G industry.

The company\\u2019s revenue jumped 16.3% y-y to RM283.7 million, which was attributed to higher contributions from a hook up, commissioning and top-side major maintenance contract from Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd. Stripping out an unrealised forex gain of RM7.1 million in 1H2015, the company\\u2019s pre-tax profit rose by 26.5% to RM14.9 million.

THE outlook for the oil and gas sector may be gloomy but KKB Engineering Bhd\\u2019s recent fabrication contract wins have helped it buck the trend. Expectations rose when the Sarawak-based KKB\\u2019s 43%-owned Oceanmight Sdn Bhd was granted an offshore fabrication licence by Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) in March 2013. Essentially, such a licence is necessary to participate in the oil and gas fabrication jobs dished out by Petronas. Not surprisingly, after securing the licence, KKB\\u2019s shares surged 96% to RM2.65 in just five months. There are seven Petronas-licensed fabricators and KKB (fundamental: 1.95; valuation: 2.40) is one of two in Sarawak. The other is Brooke Dockyard and Engineering Works Corp, which operates a more than 100-year-old yard.\\u00a0 Considering that Sarawak has quite a number of oilfields to be developed, KKB should prove to be at an advantage compared with the fabricators from the peninsula, who have to grapple with high transport costs.\\u00a0  Nevertheless, in tandem with the crumbling crude oil prices \\u2014 now trading just below US$50 per barrel \\u2014 KKB\\u2019s share price plunged 55.46% to RM1.18 in January. It has since gained 30.04% and closed at RM1.54 last Friday, giving the company a market capitalisation of RM397 million. According to Bloomberg, MIDF Research and AmResearch have a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on KKB and a target price of RM1.80 and RM2.05 respectively. A technical note by UOB-Kay Hian says KKB managed to penetrate its breakout level of RM1.51 on Sept 14 and rose 4.8% or seven sen that day to reach an intra-day high of RM1.52.\\u00a0 The research house adds that the technicals indicate stronger buying momentum ahead and has target prices of RM1.73 and RM1.92 for the stock.\\u00a0 This was just after the group announced a slew of contracts worth RM171.1 million the week before.\\u00a0 Alliance DBS Research, on the other hand, says the upside indicates an urgency to establish stock position. Following its close on Sept 14, the stock is expected to test higher ground again with the immediate hurdle being RM1.56. To recap, KKB\\u2019s share price jumped after the announcement of its second offshore fabrication job from Talisman Malaysia Ltd for the engineering, procurement and construction of a wellhead platform for the Kinabalu redevelopment project off the coast of Sabah; the award of a tender from Syarikat SESCO Bhd for the annual supply and delivery of steel products; and a letter of award from Sarawak Energy Bhd for the supply, delivery, erection and commissioning of a 1,000-tonne fuel storage tank for the Lawas power station in Sarawak.\\u00a0 Collectively, the three deals have a value of RM171.1 million and should contribute to KKB\\u2019s earnings over the next few years.\\u00a0 \\u201cFor a small and new oil and gas fabrication player to have been able to grab the Kinabalu job is a testament to the group, especially when it\\u2019s in an environment where offshore fabrication jobs are hard to come by. KKB is still trying to get other fabrication jobs but competition is tight and margins need to be sacrificed,\\u201d says an industry observer. She notes that KKB\\u2019s offshore facility construction, major onshore fabrication licence is valid only for three years and expires in 2016.\\u00a0 Although there is a slowdown, she adds, there is room for KKB to secure more jobs. \\u201cIf not in oil and gas, KKB can still participate in other civil construction works as it is still vying for jobs under the Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy and road and pipe works in Sarawak, among others,\\u201d she says. AmResearch forecasts KKB achieving a net profit of RM37.4 million on the back of revenue of RM149.7 million for FY2015 and a lower net profit of RM34.2 million on a revenue of RM102.3 million for FY2016.  The revised forecast is based on KKB\\u2019s net profit, which fell to RM6.66 million in its second quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2QFY2015) from RM7.59 million during the same quarter the year before. This was also on a lower revenue of RM30.12 million in 2QFY2015 from RM48.47 million previously. In the first half of 2015 (1HFY2015), KKB\\u2019s net profit surged to RM33.33 million from RM11.39 million during the same period last year. This was on the back of a higher revenue of RM106.84 million in 1HFY2015 from RM91.09 million a year ago. AmResearch maintains KKB\\u2019s new oil and gas fabrication order assumption for OceanMight Sdn Bhd at RM150 million each in FY2015 and FY2016. Its analyst Thomas Soon says in a research report on Sept 14, following KKB\\u2019s latest contract win, OceanMight\\u2019s tender book stands at RM150 million. \\u201cWe believe other tenders are being pursued to the tune of RM120 million. KKB is aggressive in pursuing jobs in Sabah and Sarawak.\\u201d Apart from oil and gas fabrication, Soon cut KKB\\u2019s conventional job assumption for FY2015 to RM80 million from RM250 million previously. \\u201cOur new order assumption for FY2016 and FY2017 is now RM200 million each versus RM250 million and RM280 million respectively previously.

Asdion Bhd announced that Tengku Azlan Ibni Sultan Abu Bakar, Datuk Yen Soon Ai and Datuk Mohamed Ridzuan Nor MD resigned last Saturday. In its Bursa filings today, the computer software specialist said former chairman Tengku Azlan, and the two former executive directors Yen and Mohamed Ridzuan did not give reasons for their resignations.\nThey were supposed to stand for re-election today at Asdion\\u2019s annual general meeting. Their resignations followed a recent announcement on Asdion\\u2019s higher audited net loss for financial year ended March 31, 2015 (FY15) compared to the unaudited figures. Asdion told the exchange on Sept 1 this year its FY15 audited net loss was RM2.81 million versus the unaudited net loss of RM2.07 million.\n\\u201cThe deviation is mainly due to wrong calculation of the non-controlling interests for newly acquired subsidiary,\\u201d Asdion said then. MMC Corp Bhd's wholly-owned subsidiary, Senai Airport City Sdn Bhd (SACSB), has leased 24.75 acres of its industrial land to Japanese food products supplier Fuji Oil Asia Pte Ltd, for RM53.9 million.\nFuji Oil Asia, which is part of the Fuji Oil Group, entered into a lease agreement with SACSB for 60 years to construct and operate its manufacturing facility, said MMC Corp in a statement today. Headquartered in Japan, Fuji Oil Asia is a global supplier of intermediate food ingredients, particularly specialty oils and fats, confectionery and bakery, soy protein and its related consumer food products. The facility will be its largest outside Japan and is located adjacent to its major client: US-based confectionary Hershey\\u2019s largest chocolate manufacturing facility outside of North America. SACSB is the master developer of the 2,718 acre integrated industrial development known as Senai Airport City, with various industrial segments such as free industrial zone, hi-tech and general manufacturing, aerospace maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) as well as logistics and mixed development, which are currently being developed in phases with 40% completed to date. According to the statement, MMC Corp is leveraging to capitalise on the sale and/or lease of its strategic property assets in Johor, comprising almost 5,000 acres of industrial land in both Senai Airport City and the Tanjung Bin Petrochemical & Maritime Industry Centre developments. It is also looking to unlock the values of almost 500 acres of pockets of lands and buildings mainly in the central and northern states to support its revenue growth in the next five years. Consumer product manufacturer Takaso Resources Bhd\\u2019s net loss widened to RM4.88 million for its fourth quarter ended July 31, 2015 (4QFY15) from RM3.01 million in 4QFY14. On a cumulative full year basis, its annual net losses for the financial year ended July 31, 2015 widened to RM7.99 million from RM5.95 million in the previous year. \"The increase was mainly due to additional impairment loss on plant and machinery of RM1.5 million and impairment loss on receivables of RM820,000 during the current quarter and cumulative period under review compared with the corresponding quarter and cumulative period ended 31 July 2014,\" said Takaso in a filing with Bursa today. Revenue contracted 20% to RM6.35 million from RM7.94 million previously due to the slowdown in its computer accessories business. Full year revenue was weaker at RM36.76 million, down 2.1% from RM37.56 million a year ago. The lower revenue was caused by a slowdown in cathode ray tube glass business and trading in consumable products despite improvements in its electrical and mechanical products and computer accessories segment. \\u00a0 The company has been facing challenges in its core business of manufacturing and marketing of condoms and baby products as raw material prices and operational cost rose over the last few years. Bursa Malaysia will proceed to delist Practice Note 17 company Octagon Consolidated Bhd from its Official List of Securities tomorrow, despite the company's appeal. In its filing with Bursa today, Octagon said that Bursa has informed the company that the decision of its listing committee is final, and reiterated that the securities of the company will be removed from the official list of Bursa Securities tomorrow.\nOctagon submitted a letter of appeal to Bursa Malaysia last Friday, appealing against its delisting and seeking approval from the regulator for an extension of time, up to 60 days, from the date of the letter of appeal to submit its proposed regularisation plan. Trading in the securities of Octagon was suspended on Nov 27, 2013. It last traded at seven sen for a market capitalisation of RM11.7 million. Aluminum billets manufacturer A-Rank Bhd saw its net profit for the fourth quarter ended July 31, 2015 (4QFY15) climbed 32.8% to RM3.98 million from RM2.99 million a year ago, due to the overprovision of deferred taxation in prior years.\nEarnings per share expanded to 3.31 sen from 2.49 sen. However, A-Rank announced to Bursa today that its revenue for the quarter fell 6.4% to RM115.48 million from RM123.35 million in the same corresponding period.\nThe company explained the decline in revenue was due to lower business volume although average selling prices were higher as a result of the increase in raw material cost. A-Rank has proposed a first and final single-tier dividend of 2.25 sen per share, amounting to RM2.7 million, for FY15. For FY15, A-Rank's net profit rose 8.63% to RM10.32 million, or 8.6 sen per share, against RM9.5 million, or 7.92 sen per share, a year earlier.\nRevenue was almost flat at RM485.95 million compared with RM487.3 million in FY14. A-Rank said the volatility of aluminium prices and weak ringgit has had adverse impacts on its profit margins and the increase in natural gas pricing from July 1 has also added further pressure to margins. Barring unforeseen circumstances, the company said it is \"optimistic\" to remain profitable for the forthcoming quarter. Tadmax Resources Bhd is divesting its entire stake in wholly-owned Usama Industries Sdn Bhd to individuals Phua Bok Chuan and Nai Kin Nai Chooi for RM1.99 million. Tadmax entered into a share sale agreement for the proposed divestment aimed at realising the net assets value of an inactive entity. Property developer Tadmax added that the proceeds from the sale will be channelled to working capital purposes, including overhead expenditure.\nIt does not expect the sale to have any material impact on the company\\u2019s earnings and net assets for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2015. Usama Industries\\u2019 primary activity was the extraction and trading of timber logs, but the company has been dormant since July 2010 after the expiration of its timber concession in Kapit, Sarawak. Tadmax\\u2019s original cost of investment in Usama Industries was RM200,000 in August 1993. The original cost of investment was reduced by RM100.08 million following the payment of dividend out of pre-acquisition profits during the financial year ended Dec 31, 2005. Abu Dhabi state fund Aabar Investments may refuse to invest in a RM2.5 billion (US$565 million) rights issue by RHB Capital, Reuters reported. RHB announced the rights issue in April to support its growth and meet regulatory requirements for capital. Aabar owns about 21.09% of the bank group. But three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters in the last few days that Aabar was unlikely to buy into the offer partly because it was disappointed by the performance of its investment in RHB as Malaysia\\u2019s currency and financial markets sag. A Malaysian investment banker who requested anonymity said Aabar was not happy with their RHB investment and will not subscribe. Penang-based Pentamaster Corp Bhd is proposing to acquire Origo Ventures (M) Sdn Bhd, a property project management company for RM5.78 million.\nIn its Bursa filing today, Pentamaster said that it entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire two ordinary shares, representing a 100% stake in Origo from Sulaiman Ahmad and Sabariah Ahmad. \\u201cOrigo is headed by an experienced general manager that has more than 14 years of architecture and property project management experience that span across major Malaysian property companies, namely Sunway Bhd, TRC Development Sdn Bhd, Talam Corporation Bhd and IOI Properties Bhd,\" said the global manufacturing industries automation solutions provider. On April 15, Origo was contracted by by Maarij Development Sdn Bhd to project manage a mixed development project measuring about 9.88 acres in the new township of Tunjong, Jajahan Kota Bharu, Kelantan. The gross development value is approximately RM164 million, and the total remuneration for the project management agreement shall equate to 60% of the net profit generated from the development. To date, Origo has an outstanding billing of approximately RM3 million to Maarij, upon the completion of stages of work done. The proposed acquisition is expected to be financed through Pentamaster's internally generated funds. Upon the completion of the proposed acquisition, the group also stands to gain financially from Origo's existing contract, it said. Muar Ban Lee Group Bhd's (MBL) wholly-owned unit Muar Ban Lee Engineering Sdn Bhd (MBLE) is subscribing to a 51% stake in PT Serdang Jaya Perdana (SJP), which is IDR 15.3 billion or RM4.57 million, to venture into the upstream industry of palm kernel oil processing and manufacturing. In a Bursa filing today, MBL said that MBLE today subscribed to a new additional allotment of IDR 15.3 billion paid up share capital in SJP at par value, equivalent to 51% shareholdings, to be satisfied in cash generated internally. Pursuant to the subscription, SJP will become a subsidiary of MBLE. The purchase was arrived on a willing buyer-willing seller basis after taking into consideration the audited consolidated net assets of SJP as at Dec 31, 2014 and the potential earnings of SJP. The subscription will be completed within 60 days. MBLE is principally involved in manufacturing and trading in all kinds of machinery, tools, plants, hardware, building materials, accessories and engineering requisites, while SJP operates a palm kernel crushing plant where crude palm kernel oil is extracted from palm kernel. Gamuda Bhd's net profit declined 25.4% to RM153.68 million in the fourth quarter ended July 31, 2015 (4QFY15) from RM205.89 million a year ago, mainly due to the completion of the electrified-double tracking railway. In the filing to Bursa filing, the construction company said its revenue rose 5.28% to RM623.27 million from RM592 million a year ago. The earnings per share (EPS) was 6.39 sen versus 8.89 sen.\nFor the full year of FY15, Gamuda's net profit fell 5.2% to RM682.1 million from RM719.4 million. Annual EPS decreased to 28.94 sen from 31.29 sen.\nRevenue was at RM2.4 billion, a slight increase of 7.62% compared with RM2.23 billion in FY14. Gamuda attributed the increase in revenue to higher contribution from Kesas Sdn Bhd as a result of the additional stake in the concessionaire of Shah Alam Expressway. Moving forward, the group anticipates a good performance next calendar year from ongoing construction projects and steady earnings from the water and expressway concessions division. \"However, with the softening residential and non-residential property market, weaker growth for the property division is expected over the coming quarters,\" it added. Gamuda's share price has fallen from a peak of RM5.15 in May to a 28-month low of RM3.85 last month. Lembaga Tabung Haji (LTH) has raised its stake in Cypark Resources Bhd to 10.17%, from 8.52%, after purchasing four million shares over a four-day trading period last week. In its Bursa Malaysia announcement today, Cypark Resources said LTH bought total of four million shares between Sept 21 and Sept 25.

The delay in the RAPID project has widened APFT\\u2019s net loss from RM19.7 million in FYMar2014 to RM22.5 million in FY2015.

This also allows transfer of knowledge, technology and capability to Malaysian yards,\\u201d read the statement. In July, a platform piece weighing as much as 14,000 average family cars was manoeuvred at a record-breaking height. Specially-built structures lifted the 13,800-tonne \\u201ctopside\\u201d \\u2014 with its production equipment and living quarters \\u2014 to a height of 40m before moving 90m across and then lowering it onto the hull. The operation was completed in 11 days, followed by weeks of integrating systems and testing. In total, the integrated platform \\u2014 the first of its kind in Malaysia \\u2014 weighs 27,500 tonnes. Shell Global Solutions Malaysia managing director (MD) Simon Ong said the record breaking feat was achieved thanks to the excellent collaboration among Petronas, Shell, TMJV, ALE Heavylift Sdn Bhd and Shell\\u2019s other subcontractors. \\u201cOur projects in Malaysia have allowed Shell to share deep-water expertise with the Malaysian oil and gas industry, assisting in the government\\u2019s goal to create an offshore industry hub,\\u201d said Ong. MMHE MD and chief executive officer Abu Fitri Abdul Jalil concurred. \\u201cMalikai will be Malaysia\\u2019s third deepwater project to be safely completed by MMHE. This project has helped develop local deepwater resources, infrastructure and expertise, towards securing Malaysia\\u2019s position as a regional deepwater hub and centre of excellence,\\u201d said Abu Fitri. Technip Asia Pacific president KK Lim said the group is proud to see the results of its mutual cooperation come to fruition. \\u201cThe \\u2018superlift\\u2019 brings us a step closer to completing the first TLP platform for Malaysia. The Shell Malikai TLP adds to our technological leadership in executing and delivering Malaysia\\u2019s deepwater field development projects and the world\\u2019s first two floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facilities \\u2014 Petronas FNLG 1 and Shell Prelude \\u2014 which will be based in the Asia Pacific,\\u201d said Lim. Located 100km offshore in Sabah, Malikai is Shell\\u2019s second deep-water project in Malaysia, following the successful start-up of Gumusut-Kakap last year. The project is expected to have a production capacity of 60,000 barrels per day. Globally, Shell has produced around 370,000 barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) every day from deep-water projects in 2014, comprising nearly 12% of the group\\u2019s total global production. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), around 270 billion barrels of recoverable oil lie beneath deep water. Deep-water oil already accounts for 7% of all conventional oil produced.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries\\u2019 (Opec) monthly oil report predicted higher crude oil demand of 30.3 million barrels per day next year, supporting the view that the pressure on declining oil prices would control the US shale boom and cut global surpluses. China and Latin America have been said to contribute to slower growth next year on weaker economic outlooks. The US Energy Information Administration also published data showing a slowdown in US oil production to 9.13 million barrels per day, which is significant and accelerating, equivalent to entire outputs of countries such as Ecuador and Libya\\u2019s current production levels. To recap, we touched on our view of the W-shaped course in March \\u2014 the crash, recover, crash, recover trend, whereby we are at the bottom part of the \\u201cW\\u201d. This drop could be longer than expected, considering a chain of events snowballing to this point but will eventually rebound on the back of expectations such as the International Energy Agency\\u2019s view that non-Opec production will fall by 500,000 barrels per day in 2016. We retain our \\u201coverweight\\u201d view on the sector, premised on our view that oil price stability seems to be in sight, assuming that supply overhang issues will eventually be erased with rising global demand and shrinking US output estimates. The Iraqi government has warned oil companies about expected lower reimbursement levels due to a fall in oil sales revenue, which would reduce funds available to the oil ministry, on the back of Iraq increasing production of more than four million barrels per day. Issues of oil companies unable to operate in Iraq securely and dependant on consistent payments from the government could hinder the country\\u2019s long-term ability to continue increasing its oil output. The domestic oil and gas market is stimulated by Petroliam Nasional Bhd, in anticipation of more contracts, delayed since the second half of financial year 2014. Contract \\u00a0types include engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning, fabrication, maintenance services and various jobs for the refinery and petrochemical integrated development. US dollar appreciation in recent days has made commodities more expensive for other currency holders, placing further stress on an oil price rebound. In the United States, indebted companies are increasing as traditional lending and equity markets are less willing to fund marginal companies. So, these companies are turning to private equity investors who are also on the lookout for them, but most often at steeper interest rates and demanding terms for the operators. Devaluation of the yuan shook the world, even as Chinese stock exchanges fell, reinforcing concerns about China\\u2019s economic health. Some red flags have been raised with high levels of provincial debt, an inflated stock market and environmental pollution that could force the Chinese government to loosen its reins on two decades of phenomenal growth. China\\u2019s fragile condition, coupled with evidence of a growing crude glut build-up, could serve as a dampener on oil prices. Countries that depend heavily on exports to China also saw their currencies sliding. Japan recorded a 1.6% annualised contraction in gross domestic product in the first half of 2015, on the back of weak domestic consumer spending and slowing exports. Its weak numbers contributed to the recent sell-off as well. The Indonesian government approved plans to invest US$3.7 billion (RM15.69 billion) to develop 18 oil and gas fields to offset declining production and to boost government revenue. Indonesia wants to secure supply contracts with Opec members, following its plans to ramp up its refining capacity. The country has been lobbying for this and has also been confirmed to be rejoining the Opec as a full member in December, with an aim of producing 825,000 barrels per day this year, although it could miss this target as only 812,000 barrels per day are expected to be produced. Uzma Bhd will be buoyed by full-year contributions from MMSVS Group Holdings Co Ltd and Premier Enterprise Corp (M) Sdn Bhd, a stake increase in Setegap Ventures Petroleum Sdn Bhd to 49%, awards for Sazma Aviation Sdn Bhd and a D-18 Water injection facility for Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd (PCSB). Petra Energy Bhd saw an early activation of a topside major maintenance services contract by PCSB for its Sabah operation effective since July 4, 2014, and will last until May 20, 2018, as well as higher work orders under the Pan Malaysia contract. Its KBM cluster RSC have produced four million barrels of oil to date.

It climbed above the short-term 30-day moving average and this indicates that the trend is turning bullish. However, the index is still below the Ichimoku Cloud indicator and the long-term 200-day moving average. This indicates that the market is currently in a bearish trend correction. The thin Ichimoku Cloud indicator in the next one week indicates that the market is headed for a sideways movement.

However, the FBM KLCI may face resistance at 1,660 points and the bearish global market performances may weigh down the market.

The proposed private placement is expected to entail the issuance of 50.25 million Nova MSC shares, representing 10% of its enlarged issued and paid up share capital. Using an illustrative price of 10.5 sen per placement share, which is priced at a discount of 9.48% of the five-day volume weighted average price (VWAP) of Nova MSC shares up to and including Sept 11, 2015, the proposed private placement is expected to raise gross proceeds of up to RM5.28 million. Of this, RM5.13 million is expected to be utilised for working capital purposes, while the remaining RM150,000 is expected to be used for the expense of the placement exercise. The placement shares will be issued based on a discount, if any, of not more than 10% of the five-day VWAP of Nova MSC shares, immediately preceding the price-fixing date. The proposed private placement may be implemented in tranches within six months, the filing stated. The trading of Fututech Bhd shares will be suspended tomorrow pending the injection of two building construction firms into the company. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, Fututech said it is expected to make an announcement tomorrow. It is learnt that Fututech is expected to finalise its asset injection exercise by its controlling shareholder. Fututech had on Feb 6, 2015 entered into a heads of agreement with Fututech executive chairman Datuk Tee Eng Ho, Datin Toh Siew Chuon and Tee Eng Seng to explore and negotiate further the proposed acquisitions of Kerjaya Prospek Sdn Bhd and Permatang Bakti Sdn Bhd. The purchase consideration was RM380 million, which will be settled by the issue of 280 million new ordinary shares of 50 sen each in Fututech at an issue price of RM1.16 per share and the balance in cash. Super Enterprise Holdings Bhd will be delisted from the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia this Friday (Sept 18). The company said that it has received a letter today from Bursa, which stated that pursuant to Paragraph 16.07(a) of the Main Market Listing Requirements, the entire issued share capital of Super Enterprise will be removed from the official list of Bursa with effect from 9am on Friday. Nasdaq-listed Multi-Color Corp (MCC) had on June 17 launched a takeover offer to acquire all the shares in Super Enterprise, which manufactures product decorating and labelling solutions and is involved in the sale of labelling machines, at an offer price of RM3.80 per Super Enterprise share or RM158.4 million. The offer became unconditional on Aug 11, after MCC\\u2019s indirect wholly-owned subsidiary MCC LABL2 Netherlands BV, which made the takeover offer, received valid acceptances for 37.87 million shares or 90.87% in the company. Shares of Super Enterprise have been suspended from trading since Sept 4. Halex International Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of Halex Holdings Bhd, has entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the major shareholder of VW Win Holdings Plc (VW Win), Goh Teik Keng, for a proposed acquisition of at least 51% stake in the latter. VW Win currently operates a licensed lottery gaming business in Cambodia, and intends to apply for and operate an online gaming license in the country. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, Halex said that the proposed acquisition shall be conditional upon the fulfilment of the conditions as stated in the MoU by Dec 10, this year. The conditions stipulated in the MoU include Halex International receiving necessary approvals from the relevant authorities in Cambodia with regards to the proposed sale and purchase of the shares as well as regulators Bursa Malaysia and Securities Commission. The MoU also states that VW Win must obtain a valid online gaming licence in Cambodia. Goh has also agreed to execute and provide a valid guarantee to Halex that the group\\u2019s annual net profit shall not be less than US$3 million, for a period of three years beginning financial year 2016, according to the filing. Metal Reclamation Bhd, which is in Practice Note 17 status, has been granted a two-week extension for a restraining order the company had obtained to ensure its proposed corporate debt restructuring scheme is carried out fairly. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, Metal Reclamation said the court had extended the restraining order for 14 days from Sept 2, 2015. Metal Reclamation said the group had sought to restrain all potential litigations or proceedings which may affect the formulation of the proposed corporate debt restructuring scheme. The company found it necessary to obtain the order to ensure that the creditors of the company and its subsidiaries were treated \\u201cequally and efficiently\\u201d. Metal Reclamation said the debts owed by the company and its subsidiaries to the creditors will be restructured under the scheme, which is pending the finalisation of the proposed arrangement for the scheme creditors. This is the third extension granted by the courts to Metal Reclamation\\u2019s restraining order.

Barely a fortnight after the world began talking about the possibility of crude oil prices dropping to US$30 a barrel, Brent prices jumped by the most in 6\\u00bd years last Thursday and went on to reach US$48.45 before settling at the US$47 level for the week. The 14.7% surge to that intra-week high, from its lowest in almost seven years of US$42.23 intraday on Aug 24, helped Malaysia\\u2019s bellwether FBM KLCI stock index gain 5.3% over four days to end the week at 1,612.74 points. While Wall Street\\u2019s rally on renewed optimism of a US economic recovery also lifted spirits across global stock markets last week, those gains on Bursa Malaysia took some by surprise, as it came ahead of the Aug 29 and 30 Bersih 4 street rally calling for transparency and electoral reforms. The gains also came even as ratings agency Moody\\u2019s Investors Service says \\u201cclouds are gathering on Malaysia\\u2019s positive [sovereign ratings] outlook\\u201d. Depending on whom one asks, there are people who reckon Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak last week won some brownie points by bringing critics and old guard alongside academics and corporate chieftains on board his 10-man special economic committee to minimise the impact of \\u201cany arising economic issues\\u201d. The members include former second finance minister Tan Sri Nor Mohamed Yakcop \\u2014 who in 1998 helped former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad put in place the since rescinded ringgit peg and capital controls \\u2014 and CIMB Group chairman Datuk Seri Nazir Razak, who has been openly critical of the current administration. \\u201cWill speak [the] truth to [those in] power & hope it will help [the] government to steer economy through this turmoil and lessen the pain,\\u201d Nazir said on his Instagram account last Thursday, after the surprise appointment. \\u201cI hope the new economic committee will take the bull by the horns and introduce radical reforms rather than adopt superficial measures. We are coming from a position of weakness because of the current policy framework, and politics is a sign of that weakness. Too much politics is bad for economics and progress,\\u201d says Tan Sri Ramon Navaratnam, chairman of ASLI\\u2019s Centre for Public Policy Studies. Others, however, point out that Malaysia already has res- pected policymakers like Bank Negara Malaysia Governor Tan Sri Zeti Akhtar Aziz, who was not selected to join the committee, whose chairman, Datuk Seri Abdul Wahid Omar, is minister in the Prime Minister\\u2019s Department in charge of the Economic Planning Unit. They also reckon the ringgit\\u2019s precipitous fall in recent weeks was more than a mere reflection of wavering confidence. INCEIF emeritus professor Datuk Mohamed Ariff, for one, says the country needs to act fast to regain confidence and credibility, and that there are \\u201cclear writings on the wall\\u201d that Malaysia\\u2019s economic fundamentals \\u201chave weakened considerably in recent times\\u201d. \\u201cIt appears that the country is in denial mode \\u2026 The sharp fall in commodity prices, rapidly shrinking ringgit, ballooning external debt, ailing stock market and falling central bank reserves are all taking a heavy toll on the Malaysian economy. And yet, we keep hearing that the fundamentals are still strong. Such talk only serves to dampen investor sentiment further, as these give rise to the impression that the government cannot even recognise or understand that there is a problem in the first place, let alone fix it,\\u201d he says, adding that Malaysia cannot blame all its woes on external factors. \\u201cThe crisis the country currently faces is largely home-grown. It smacks of poor governance and mismanagement. The ongoing financial scandals speak volumes. The poor handling of the issues with no straight answers and the absence of checks and balances have affected the country\\u2019s image in the global arena \\u2026 The economy is bogged down in a crisis of confidence and credibility. To put the economy back on track, we must restore confidence and credibility, which can only come with increased transparency, disclosures and accountability.\\u201d That Malaysia\\u2019s public debt has ballooned considerably on the back of 18 straight years of budget deficits limits policy manoeuvres when the country needs to weather global economic headwinds. While the headline debt-to-gross domestic product ratio is below the 55% self-imposed ceiling, public debt is north of 66% if quasi-government guarantees were to be included, experts say. \\u201cStock market volatility, commodity market selldown and economic slowdown in China, not to mention the eurozone malaise, are all symptomatic of an impending global deflation,\\u201d says Ariff, without providing a timeframe. As he sees it, Malaysia is \\u201cmost vulnerable\\u201d to happenings in the Chinese economy, as China is currently the number one destination for Malaysia\\u2019s exports and number one source of Malaysia\\u2019s imports. \\u201cObviously, we are less prepared now than we were in the mid-Nineties for such eventualities. In the mid-Nineties, we had five consecutive years of budget surplus (1993-1997), our short-term external debts accounted for less than a third of the total. Now, we are inflicted with budget deficits year after year since 1998, while foreigners hold roughly half of government bonds,\\u201d says Ariff. With at least 25% of government revenue still coming from oil and gas (although down from 39.6% in 2008), experts like him doubt higher tax receipts, including those from the newly implemented Goods and Services Tax, can fully make up for smaller oil-related receipts, thus there is limited room for fiscal stimulus. A new normal for oil prices, at US$30 to US$40, should it happen, \\u201cwill likely imply a significantly higher fiscal deficit (exceeding 4% of GDP) and a structurally lower current account surplus,\\u201d says Chua Hak Bin, head of emerging Asia economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BaML). \\u201cIt will also mean that the government can no longer rely on Petronas (Petroliam Nasional Bhd) as a lender and banker of last resort in times of crisis,\\u201d he says. Already, the national oil company, when announcing a 47% drop in its second-quarter net profit on Aug 14, said it needed to draw on its reserves and \\u201cpersevere with more austerity measures\\u201d as its operating cash was not enough to cover both its capital expenditure and the RM26 billion dividend committed to the government this year. \\u201cPolicy options are becoming more limited. Governor Zeti and Prime Minister Najib have ruled out capital controls. Forex intervention will have to be conducted more sparingly, given the rapid depletion of Bank Negara\\u2019s foreign exchange reserves,\\u201d Chua says, adding that US$8.8 billion was spent defending the ringgit in July and another US$2.2 billion in the first two weeks of August. Bank Negara will release its end-August reserves figures on Sept 4. As at mid-August, the central bank\\u2019s reserves stood at US$94.5 billion (RM356.4 billion), down 33.2% from the recent peak of US$141.43 billion in May 2013. While the reserves are still adequate to finance 7.5 times retained imports and are one times short-term external debt, RHB Research Institute executive chairman and chief economist Lim Chee Sing says the latter \\u201cis a weakness and a concern should there be a more significant erosion in foreign investor confidence, causing them to sell down their holdings of financial assets in the country and/or withdraw whatever deposits they have placed with the Malaysian banking system\\u201d. While local institutions, such as the Employees Provident Fund \\u2014 whose total investment assets stood at RM667.21 billion as at end-June 2015 \\u2014 insurance companies and sovereign wealth funds, have sufficient liquidity to absorb foreign selling, Lim says \\u201cprice will have to give if there is continuous foreign selling\\u201d. That foreign investors still hold 47.84% of the RM345.84 billion outstanding Malaysian Government Securities means there will be pressure on the ringgit and Bank Negara reserves if redemptions accelerate the way they did on the local equity market where foreign holdings are estimated at around 23% in August. Foreigners have pulled RM11.8 billion out of the local bourse year to date, surpassing the RM6.9 billion net outflow for the whole of 2014. Between March 2013 and June 2015, the balance of payments saw RM29.1 billion net outflow, largely because the RM129.2 billion net outflow from the financial account exceeded the RM100.4 billion net inflow in the current account, where a surplus position has dropped to RM7.58 billion in June 2015 from nearly RM40 billion in September 2008 as Malaysia\\u2019s exports to the world fell faster than its imports. A negative balance of payments erodes Bank Negara\\u2019s reserves position. \\u201cThe impending US Federal Reserve interest rate hike, under current market conditions, will only worsen the sell-off in the ringgit,\\u201d BaML\\u2019s Chua says, pointing out that the market currently expects 50% chance of a rate hike happening by year-end and only 16% in September. \\u201cOur [ringgit-US dollar] forecast of 4.28 is for end-2016 and is now close to being breached. We will review the forecast, pending our assessment on the Fed rate decision, given current market developments,\\u201d he adds. The US Federal Market Open Committee is scheduled to meet in mid-September, late-October and mid-December this year. Bank Negara\\u2019s monetary policy committee will meet three days earlier, on Sept 11, when it is expected to keep the key interest rate unchanged, at 3.25%. Citi Research economist Kit Wei Zheng, in a recent note, says the 100 to 150 basis point rate hike that \\u201cmost thought\\u201d is needed to defend the ringgit \\u201cis unpalatable, given softening growth and limited evidence of imported inflation\\u201d. \\u201cDrastic rate hikes will also be counter-productive as softer domestic demand and knock-on impact from non-oil fiscal revenues could give speculators another reason to short the ringgit,\\u201d he adds. Malaysia\\u2019s high household debt, at 87.8% of GDP \\u2014 among the highest in the region \\u2014 also raises the odds of savers being taxed with negative real (inflation-adjusted) returns. Deutsche Bank economist Diana Del-Rosario is more sanguine about Bank Negara\\u2019s reserves building up again, pointing out that Malaysia recorded a surplus in the balance of payments in the second quarter, driven by a turnaround of other investments like loans and forex deposits to net inflows. \\u201cWe do not know the reason behind these inflows, but we suspect they could be due to the weaker ringgit or a result of a government/Bank Negara initiative to contain the decline in reserves. If so, then it is likely these inflows could continue for the rest of the year,\\u201d she says, adding that the current account surplus \\u201ccould also widen as exports slightly improve and imports soften because of weak demand prospects\\u201d. She also reckons the government could \\u201cmake modest adjustments to its foreign exchange administration policies\\u201d such as cutting the time limit for the repatriation of export proceeds to less than six months. According to Citi\\u2019s economists, a sizeable difference between trade data reported by Malaysia and its trading partners \\u201csuggested that a chunk of export earnings were kept offshore, notwithstanding Bank Negara regulations that export proceeds have to be repatriated within six months\\u201d. Still, they also told clients that the government\\u2019s appeal to repatriate liquid foreign assets had hitherto had only limited effects as some government-linked investment companies claimed that such decisions \\u201cwould have to be made primarily on commercial grounds, given the need to hit target returns\\u201d. \\u201cAn easier option would be the conversion of about US$30 billion of foreign currency deposits with onshore banks,\\u201d the Aug 24 note reads. Yet the impact of such moves would be fleeting, should there be high selling pressure, experts admit. \\u201cWhether the market has been overly bearish and if there is more weakness to come will depend largely on whether the major world economies can do more to hold up growth, if need be, or whether more policy missteps \\u2014 such as China\\u2019s heavy intervention in the equity markets and renminbi devaluation that derailed confidence \\u2014 are being taken to cause the global growth cycle to turn down earlier than expected. \\u201cWhether Malaysia has enough policy options to weather the storm also depends on the extent of the storm, and whether it is global in nature, although there is room for the country to take appropriate measures to mitigate it,\\u201d RHB\\u2019s Lim says. Over the longer term, he says Malaysia \\u2014 which is stuck in the middle-income trap \\u2014 needs a stronger ringgit to encourage industries to gradually advance up the value chain to restore competitiveness. \\u201cEmphasis on the quality of products and services with good branding is what we need as the country evolves into a developed country by 2020.\\u201d That means Malaysia needs to get its act together quickly for the ringgit to strengthen again.  This article first appeared in digitaledge Weekly, on August 31 - September 6, 2015."}, "445": {"date_posted": "11/9/2015", "title": "Uzma confident of resilient earnings growth ", "article": " Although the low crude oil price environment has seen Uzma Bhd\\u2019s share price more than halve within a year, the oil and gas service provider is expecting resilient earnings growth for at least three more years. The stock dove 64.87% to a 52-week low of RM1.32 in December last year from a peak of RM3.75 in the same period. It has since regained 26.55% and closed at RM1.71 on Aug 28. Uzma CEO Datuk Kamarul Redzuan Muhamed tells digitaledge Weekly that the group is in a safe spot because it is involved mainly in a business that caters for fields in production. \\u00a0 \\u201cThey [oil companies] need to produce regardless [of the price environment] and they probably need to produce more with the drop in prices. So, Uzma is in the right kind of market [brownfield services],\\u201d he says. Kamarul acknowledges the dramatic change in the industry over the past three months but he believes Uzma can weather the storm that is expected to blow for a while. His confidence stems from the group\\u2019s order book \\u2014 which stands at RM2.7 billion and will keep the group busy until 2021 \\u2014 and its ability to provide services to oil companies so that they can produce oil economically. \\u201cThere are basically no activities in exploration at the moment, which is why rig counts are down. The budget for exploration has been slashed but production has to continue and the products that Uzma has to offer support existing production. That\\u2019s why we feel we are slightly different from the others,\\u201d Kamarul remarks. He explains that Uzma is not only involved in exploration but also in the provision of services for already producing fields. On top of that, it has recurring income from its chemical business, amongst others, which is in demand as long as production continues. \\u201cThe country needs the production; there is no point in slowing down. If Petroliam Nasional Bhd does not keep up with production, it won\\u2019t have any money \\u2014 that\\u2019s its revenue,\\u201d says Kamarul. \\u00a0 It bears noting that the current market is much more challenging than when Uzma got listed in 2008. However, Kamarul says the company is doing well and is still looking at 30% to 40% revenue growth in the next three years. Uzma (fundamental: 1.10; valuation: 1.80) reported a 7.05% year-on-year increase in net profit to RM9.26 million or 3.44 sen per share in its second quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2QFY2015). Revenue, especially from secured long-term contracts, rose 31.45% to RM104.09 million. In the first half of FY2015, the group posted a 1.35% y-o-y increase in net profit to RM17.31 million on revenue that rose 41.28% from the previous corresponding period to RM288.62 million. Kamarul sees a stronger second half for the group, thanks to its risk-service contract and D18 water injection facility (WIF), among others, which will spill over into FY2016. Uzma\\u2019s revenue growth projection is backed by its contract wins this year. It kicked off the year with a RM50 million contract from Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd for the provision of through tubing downhole tolls and services. It was later awarded a contract for the provision of cased hole electric-line logging perforation and other services for RM59 million.\\u00a0 Petronas Carigali also awarded the group two contracts for the provision of helicopter services in Sabah for an aggregated value of RM166.5 million and one for the leasing, operating and maintaining of the D18 WIF for the oil company. The latter, which has an estimated value of RM400 million, involves the complete engineering and construction, installation and commissioning of the WIF and providing operational and maintenance services. Apart from these jobs, Uzma also entered into a memorandum of understanding with the East Coast Economic Region Development Council to develop an integrated offshore supply base in Kemaman, Terengganu, for the group\\u2019s use that has a potential investment of RM471.48 million over 15 years. \\u201cWhile everybody has been quiet, we have been getting quite a few jobs and all the contracts that we announced recently are related to existing oil production. Existing oil is the cheapest to produce and at this point in time, everybody has come to the realisation that things are challenging. \\u201cOur biggest challenge at the moment is margin pressure. Not only Petronas but everybody else is pushing for lower margins. In the first quarter of this year, everybody was negotiating contracts or renegotiating existing contracts,\\u201d says Kamarul. Although he does not state the group\\u2019s margin, according to The Edge Research, Uzma saw its net margin rise to 8.14% in FY2013 from 7.66% in FY2012. Currently, it has a lower rolling 12-month net margin of 6.62%. Kamarul points out that Uzma goes through three \\u201chealth checks\\u201d: the health of its bid book, the utilisation of its assets and the value rates of its services. \\u201cBut the problem with rates is that they are going down everywhere. The only way to manage the rates is to actually manage our subcontractors.\\u201d\\u00a0 He sees a healthy bid book after the completion of the group\\u2019s three acquisitions and the establishment of three new companies last year. \\u201cThe three new companies, which include our RSC, will bring in income this year. These income streams did not exist before. Then, we made three acquisitions last year. These six things will spur our growth this year,\\u201d In 2014, Uzma acquired Well Services (Thailand) Ltd and MMSVS Group Holdings Ltd for a total of RM95 million. It also took over Premier Enterprise Corp (M) Sdn Bhd, which is involved in the supply of chemicals for oil recovery, for RM20.60 million. Kamarul notes that the group is still in acquisition mode and is looking at a few technology companies to acquire this year. Investing in technology-based companies will enable the group to offer efficiency in an environment that is cost-sensitive. \\u201cWhen Petronas tells us to cut cost, we do, and it\\u2019s because we feel that it\\u2019s a moral obligation. Everyone is obligated to share the burden at the moment. What we can do now is to improve our efficiency, renegotiate with our sub-vendors and come up with better technology,\\u201d says Kamarul, adding that although more capital is needed to improve technology-wise, there will be no recurring cost. \\u201cTechnology will drive cost down.\\u201d On Uzma\\u2019s cr\\u00e8me de la cr\\u00e8me project, the Tanjung Baram RSC in Sarawak, the group announced along with its 2QFY2015 results that the first production flowed in June. Kamarul says there have been delays, though just by a month or two, in seeing first oil and that the RSC will start contributing to the group\\u2019s earnings by the end of the year. \\u201cInvestors should know that the oil price does not have a bearing on our rent fee for the RSC. Our rent fee is fixed regardless of the oil price. So, the risk is on Petronas. But cost recovery has a bearing based on how quick capital expenditure and operational expenditure is recovered as that is based on the oil price,\\u201d Kamarul explains. He adds that if the RSC\\u2019s capex and opex are low in the current environment, it can survive. Uzma had previously announced a RM100 million capex for its RSC and to date, that is the lowest to be spent on such a project. \\u201cIt [the RSC] is still commercially viable; it\\u2019s just that people are not getting the same rate of returns as us. We are probably still going to get the same rate of returns, regardless of the oil price.\\u201d To recap, Uzma\\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary Uzma Energy Venture (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd and EQ Petroleum Developments Malaysia Sdn Bhd in March last year signed a small field RSC with Petronas to carry out the development and production for the Tanjung Baram fields. Kamarul sums up that Uzma has the capability to produce oil economically, which is what is needed in the current industry environment.

Following our recent meeting with the management, we understand that the offshore support vessel market remains in a lull, where contract awards have been slow against the backdrop of a slowdown in upstream activities. However, the group indicated that it is relatively less impacted as most of its vessels service production platforms which are insulated from capital expenditure cuts.\\u00a0 Alam Maritim is also looking into participating more in the Middle Eastern market, where activity appears to be more robust. Alam Maritim currently has two vessels in the Middle East on long-term contracts. The group has also recently won a third contract to provide its multipurpose tug vessel, MV Setia Emas, to a United Arab Emirates client for a fixed period of three years, with an extension of another two years for RM41 million. Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd has yet to have any call-out for vessels for its umbrella contract. To recap, Petronas Carigali has earlier awarded an umbrella contract for the provision of spot charters for marine vessels, for which Alam Maritim was awarded seven of eight packages. We have not factored this in earnings as the contract value is not fixed and will depend on the actual number of days the vessels are on hire, based on a call-out basis by Petronas Carigali. Overall, Alam Maritim has faced a daily charter rate reduction of 3% to 10% for eight of its vessels with existing contracts, as requested by Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas).\\u00a0 Alam Maritim has yet to take delivery of its diving support vessel (DSV), pending the approval of a US dollar loan. This would replace the currently chartered-in vessel, which would subsequently improve margins. The group expects about two DSV contracts to be awarded in the second half of FY15 (2HFY15).\\u00a0 We expect a pickup in earnings in the offshore installation and construction (OIC) division in 2HFY15, upon the execution of the remainder of the transport and installation contract secured with Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd and Technip Geoproduction (M) Sdn Bhd.

On Aug 28, 2015, MAHB had issued a statement saying it was considering taking stern action, including issuing letters of demand and seeking legal recourse, to recover overdue payments from airlines, but did not name them. It added that the arrears were mostly related to collection of passenger service charges (PSC). The PSC is a government-regulated charge that the airlines collect in advance from passengers, by including the same in the ticket price paid by passengers. The PSC is then handed over to MAHB, which will be used for the maintenance and enhancement of the airport facilities and services.

We are open to any possible opportunities,\" he told a media and analyst briefing today. He added that nothing's been firmed up at this point. The potential acquisition or merger was first reported by The Edge weekly in March this year, which had reported that HeveaBoard was planning to acquire smaller counterpart SHH. At the time, details of the acquisition were reportedly being discussed. HeveaBoard is a particle board-related manufacturer that exports to China and Japan, while SHH is a solid wood furniture manufacturer that exports to the United States.

IFCA MSC Bhd is acquiring the business of PT IFCA Consulting Indonesia (PICI), including its trade receivables and all the rights under its existing contracts, for RM32 million. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, IFCA said it signed a business sale agreement with PICI today to undertake the proposed acquisition. The two companies had entered into a heads of agreement on May 20, 2015 for the deal. The business sale agreement stipulates that half of the purchase consideration will be fulfilled by the issuance of 16 million new IFCA shares of 10 sen each, at an issue price of RM1 per share. The balance RM16 million will be satisfied with cash, of which RM4 million will be paid to PICI on the date of completion of the proposed acquisition and the balance RM12 million will be paid accordingly under the profit guarantee mechanism. IFCA said it will funded the cash consideration via internal funds. It added that the purchase consideration represents a price-to-earnings multiple of 8 times forward earnings based on the three years (ending Dec 31, 2016 to 2018) profit guarantee of RM4 million per year. As this is a profit guarantee from PICI, in the event of a shortfall in net profit, IFCA is authorised to deduct the balance cash consideration to be paid to PICI. On the rationale, IFCA (fundamental: 3.0; valuation: 1.5) explained that the proposed acquisition will accelerate its market penetration into Indonesia, which is in line with its regional expansion plans. The proposed acquisition is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year.

Both Macly managing director Herman Chang and Roxy-Pacific executive chairman Teo Hong Lim have established themselves as bone fide developers in Singapore over the years, and as such come with the experience and resources to develop quality products. They hope to replicate their success here in Malaysia. Macly Group was founded by Chang and started developing projects in 1987. To date, it has built, commercial high-rise and cluster housing projects. From 2008 to 2014, the total gross development value (GDV) of its projects amounted to S$1.041 billion. The group also owns and operates hotels under the brand Lloyd\\u2019s Inn. Roxy-Pacific Holdings was established in 1967 and was listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange on March 12, 2008. It has developed residential and commercial properties and is the owner of Grand Mercure Roxy Hotel and other investment projects. Between 2004 and 2014, it completed and launched projects with a total GDV of S$2.184 billion. Together, the two developers formed joint-venture company Macly Equity Sdn Bhd in 2013 to develop their maiden project in Kuala Lumpur, called The Colony. The 1.4-acre project will be situated right next to Quill City Mall. There is already construction activity on the freehold plot, which was purchased in 2012 for RM90 million. Teo says they are laying the foundations of the project first in order to build public confidence that they will deliver the project on time and as promised. Being new in town, he believes this is important to establish their reputation, especially since they view Kuala Lumpur as an important market. \\u201cKL is one of the key markets we want to expand to,\\u201d says Teo. \\u201cBecause Singapore is quite dry right now. After making all the money in Singapore, we need to establish a second market.\\u201d The Colony, according to Chang, is the brand name of the project, which is used for marketing purposes. But the actual name of the structure being built is Wisma Infinitum. Both gentlemen believe their RM800 million project will appeal to homebuyers and investors alike, thanks to its neighbour Quill City Mall. But Chang highlights two more reasons The Colony is an attractive proposition. It is an eight-minute walk to the Medan Tuanku monorail station, which is linked to major areas in the city centre as well as Kuala Lumpur Sentral, and close to the retail strip of Jalan Bukit Bintang. Chang and Teo also recognise that smaller sized units in city centres are currently in demand simply because of the price factor. With this in mind and their experience in building small yet liveable units, The Colony will offer 723 compact dual-key small offices/home offices units that will offer buyers various options for how they wish to use their unit. Chang says a homeowner can live in one side of the unit and rent out the other side for passive income. Or the space can be used as an office. The units will be spread across two towers. Tower A is 35 storeys with 423 units, while Tower B will be 43 storeys with 300 units. The built-ups will range from 675 sq ft to 1,180 sq ft. The facilities include a swimming pool that looks out toward the Petronas Twin Towers, an outdoor dining area with barbecue, a residents lounge and a gym. Tower A will be launched first sometime in September, while Tower B will be launched at a later date. The target market is investors and young working adults in their 30s who do not have a family yet and like living in the city. The Tower A units range from 705 to 1,155 sq ft, with most of the units in the 705 to 945 sq ft range. The average selling price is RM1,380 psf and the estimated gross rental yield is between 5.5% and 6%. The maintenance fee is about 40 sen psf. \\u201cWe compare ourselves to other developments in KLCC [Kuala Lumpur city centre], and we find ours is the most compact in size,\\u201d says Chang. \\u201cWe are compacting the size of the units to achieve higher per sq ft yield. That means we are making your per sq ft work harder for you on two fronts. One, because it is an efficient design and very useable. Two, it is dual key.\\u00a0 And yet for the selling price, we have done a study, and I think we have the most competitive pricing in the KLCC area.\\u201d Designing small units is not new to Chang as he was among the first to do so in Singapore. \\u201cI am one of the pioneers of the shoebox apartment in Singapore. So I am used to designing compact spaces,\\u201d he says. The shoebox concept featured in Macly Group\\u2019s Mackenzie 138 project, which offered 35 apartments in Mackenzie Road, Singapore. According to Chang, the smallest unit\\u2019s built-up is 409 sq ft, while the average built-up in the project is 450 sq ft. The Singapore government defines a shoebox unit as one that is below 500 sq ft. Incidentally, the project was sold out within a month in 2004. The Colony units have bathrooms in both dual-key spaces and there is a washing machine niche, Chang says. They also come with kitchen cabinets, hob and hood, sink and tap, bathroom fittings, water heater and air-conditioning units. To facilitate buyer needs, the developer is offering two packages for sale. The first is the semi-furnished package in which curtains and lights will be done for the buyer, leaving them with the option to buy their own loose furniture. The second option is the fully furnished fit out package in which everything is done for the buyer, including buying the loose furniture, making the unit move-in ready. The prices of the packages will range from around RM50,000 to RM100,000 While the project looks promising, it does come at a challenging time. According to research consultancy DTZ\\u2019s Property Times Kuala Lumpur 2Q2015 report, smaller-sized apartments with built-ups of less than 1,000 sq ft are expected to do better than those with a larger built-up due to budget constraints, but there is a large supply of small unit apartment projects in the pipeline that is expected to moderate demand. So, how will The Colony\\u00a0 compete in such a market? \\u201cThere is differentiation in The Colony \\u2014 it has compact and dual-key units,\\u201d Teo explains. \\u201cIf we are working on the same regular product as a local developer, it is not easy for us to compete in the market. It is a calculated risk [with our design] because we don\\u2019t want to be foolish and do something very crazy that the local market cannot take. So based on our judgement, our product does have its differentiation. It is not purely on price. Price cannot be the only factor.\\u201d Besides the substantial residential offering, The Colony also has a retail component over three levels. There are 31 lots with a net lettable area of 36,000 sq ft. There are no plans to sell the lots, although details of what will be in the space are still under discussion. Chang and Teo are considering the possibility of finding a management company to manage the retail area. While it seems strange to provide retail lots when The Colony is situated right next to Quill City Mall, Chang says the retailers in The Colony will complement rather than compete against the huge shopping centre. A strong partnership The Colony is Chang and Teo\\u2019s first project together in Malaysia, but they have forged a strong partnership over the years. Their individual companies have operated successfully over the years and they would have been happy to continue on their merry way if not for the 2007 Lehman Brothers\\u2019 collapse that brought them together. \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t get hit badly [then] but we thought that post-Lehman, we had to reinvent ourselves \\u2026 A few of us developers said we should sometimes join forces and work together, share our ideas, to reinvent the wheel, and at the same time pool our resources,\\u201d Teo explains. \\u201cSo it was a natural progression that brought a few developers like us to the next stage.\\u201d The partnership has so far been a pleasant experience for both parties. \\u201cIn a partnership you need to enjoy the journey together, rather than you \\u2018guard\\u2019 against your partner. I think this is very important because we both believe in working hard, don\\u2019t be \\u2018funny\\u2019 with each other or take advantage of each other. So it is very enjoyable working together,\\u201d says Chang, who trained as a civil engineer. The first project they worked on together was Haig 162 on Haig Road in Singapore. This 16-storey high-rise offered 99 units. \\u201cIt was a good collaboration; we sold 99% of the units in a few hours,\\u201d recalls Teo with a smile. He is a chartered accountant by training. To ensure that both parties continue to remain happy working together, they have structured their joint-venture companies a little differently from the usual 51:49 ratio. For example, for Macly Equity Sdn Bhd, Macly Group holds 48%, Roxy-Pacific, 47% and a friendly real estate third party familiar with the two gentlemen the remaining 5%. This tripartite structure was instituted to ensure that no one would lose out in the end. \\u201cIn a structure of 51:49, nobody is thinking,\\u201d Chang says. \\u201cThe company with 51% will say, \\u2018I\\u2019m dominating\\u2019, I don\\u2019t want to think, because I will sure win any matter.\\u2019 The 49% will say, \\u2018I will sure lose, so I don\\u2019t want to think, since you have 51%, you do the thinking.\\u2019 In the end, nobody is thinking. So our joint venture is always like this, two dominant parties and then an in-between party, a real estate person who can potentially mediate if the need arises.\\u201d So far, they have not had to utilise this mediation function as they have been able to iron out any issues amicably. Teo also highlights that this agreement protects both parties in case something happens to either one. \\u201cWe could be very good friends and we proceed along that line, but what happens if something happens to me and somebody takes over and starts to be unreasonable?\\u201d Teo explains. \\u201cAt least the common party in between us are reasonable people and mutual friends who will take the side of the guy that is working for the good of the company. We don\\u2019t want to end up with a deadlock.\\u201d As both Chang and Teo work at establishing themselves in Kuala Lumpur, they are also looking forward to working together on another JV project in Malaysia, this time in Balakong. Plans are still being finalised but the six-acre plot is looking to have a mixed-use layout with residential and commercial components. While the two partners continue their fine relationship, they also have individual projects that their respective companies are embarking on. With a keen focus on doing a good job and not getting into any \\u201cfunny business\\u201d, this partnership may very well be a long and fruitful one.

Power plant operator Malakoff Corp Bhd\\u2019s net profit fell 27% in its second quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2QFY15) to RM86.29 million from RM118.08 million a year earlier, as revenue fell after its gas-fired power plants generated less electricity. In a statement to the exchange, Malakoff said the earnings contraction was also because the group's bottom line a year in 2QFY14 included fair valuation gains from the acquisition of the remaining 75% stake in Port Dickson Power (PDP). Its 2QFY15 revenue came in at RM1.3 billion, 11.56% lower from RM1.47 billion. Its cumulative six-month (1HFY15) net profit, however, rose to RM190.2 million from RM120.73 million a year earlier, though revenue was marginally lower at RM2.64 billion compared with RM2.7 billion. Looking ahead, Malakoff expects its FY15 financials to improve compared to FY14, taking into account contribution from Tanjung Bin power plant and PDP, besides lower finance expenses. Oil and gas (O&G) brownfield services provider Petra Energy Bhd\\u2019s net profit jumped 84.5% to RM14.9 million from RM8.1 million a year ago in its second quarter ended June 30 (2QFY15), on positive contribution from its services segment and lower finance cost. Earnings per share rose to 4.63 sen, from 2.51 sen per share a year ago, its filing to Bursa today showed. Revenue for 2QFY15 came in at RM164.7 million, 29.3% higher than the RM127.4 million in 2QFY14, as a result of a higher contribution from the hook up, commissioning and top-side major maintenance (HuC/TMM) contract from PETRONAS Carigali Sdn Bhd (PCSB). In its first half ended June 30 (1HFY15), Petra\\u2019s net profit rose 86.5% to RM16.98 million (5.28 sen per share), from RM9.1 million (2.83 sen per share) a year ago; while revenue up 16.3% at RM283.7 million, from RM244 million in 1HFY14. On prospects, Petra (fundamental: 1.0; valuation: 2.0) said it will focus on growing the current business and aggressively explore new opportunities in the oil and gas value chain for new revenue streams \\u2014 which will remain a priority. Sunway Construction Group Bhd (SunCon) recorded a net profit of RM37.8 million or 2.92 sen per share for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2QFY15), mainly on contributions from ongoing local construction projects and its supply of precast concrete products to projects in Singapore. Revenue for 2QFY15 stood at RM500.22 million, its filing with Bursa showed. For the six months period, the group recorded a net profit of RM72.16 million or 5.58 sen per share on revenue of RM996.29 million. No comparative figures were available for the preceding year's corresponding period as SunCon was only listed on the Main Market of Bursa on July 28. Looking forward, the group believes it is well-positioned to bid for government-initiated projects given its track record. APM Automotive Holdings Bhd\\u2019s net profit dropped 28.4% to RM18.3 million or 9.36 sen a share for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2QFY15) from RM25.55 million or 13.05 sen a share a year ago, as production declined on fixed overhead, and raw material became more expensive due to a stronger US dollar. In a filing with the exchange, APM (fundamental: 2.5; valuation: 2.4) said revenue for 2QFY15 fell 10.1% to RM305.76 million from RM340 million in 2QFY14, on lower demand from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for certain car models.\\u00a0 Despite the lower earnings, APM declared an interim dividend of 7.5 sen per share for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2015, payable on Sept 29.\\u00a0 For the cumulative six months period (1HFY15), the automotive component maker posted a 29.1% decline in net profit to RM36.13 million or 18.47 sen per share, compared with RM50.96 million or 26.04 sen per share a year ago. Revenue was also down 3.7% to RM624.02 million in 1HFY15 from RM648.13 million in 1HFY14. Moving forward, APM warned that the group\\u2019s results for the second half of the year is expected to be adversely affected by excess production capacity. Oil palm player Sarawak Plantation Bhd\\u2019s second quarter net profit fell 66% from a year earlier, on lower crude palm oil (CPO) prices. In a statement, Sarawak Plantation (fundamental:2.4; valuation: 2.2) said net profit for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2QFY15) fell to RM4.5 million, from RM13.34 million. Revenue was lower at RM87.46 million, against RM94.58 million. During 1HFY15, Sarawak Plantation registered lower net profit at RM11.92 million, versus RM39.75 million a year earlier. Revenue fell to RM158.37 million, from RM198.58 million. Going forward, Sawarak Plantation said its performance would largely depend on CPO and PK output and prices. TIME dotCom Bhd\\u2019s net profit for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2QFY15) jumped seven times to RM315.43 million or 54.97 sen per share, largely on a fair value gain of RM274 million from the disposal of a portion of its quoted equity investments. The telecommunications provider\\u2019s net profit in the previous corresponding quarter came in at RM44 million or 7.68 sen per share. Revenue for the quarter climbed 5.16% to RM163.77 million, from RM155.74 million last year, underpinned by higher revenue contributions across all product segments \\u2014 except for global bandwidth sales and non-recurring contracts. For the cumulative six months (1HFY15), TIME (fundamental: 2.4; valuation: 1.4) posted a 406.69% increase in net profit to RM372.01 million or 64.83 sen per share, compared with RM73.42 million or 12.81 sen per share a year earlier, also due to the fair value gain. Revenue rose 16.7% to RM335.5 million, as compared to RM287.6 million a year earlier. Innofarm Sdn Bhd, the majority shareholder of poultry company Lay Hong Bhd (fundamental:0.75; valuation: 1.4) with a 37.97% stake, has emerged as a substantial shareholder in baby products and condoms maker Takaso Resources Bhd, after acquiring a 6.8% stake in the latter. In its filing with Bursa, Takaso (fundamental: 1.65; valuation:0) said Innofarm had on Aug 14, acquired 13.997 million Takaso shares (6.8% stake) in the company. It was reported that on the same date (Aug 14), Takaso's former executive chairman Tee Tze Chern had disposed of 24.1 million shares (11.73% stake) held through his interest in Nextplus Fortune Sdn Bhd, at 55 sen per share or RM13.26 million in total. Boustead Heavy Industries Corp Bhd (BHIC) is undertaking a reorganisation of its corporate structure for better operational efficiencies, organisational clarity and focus on its core businesses. In a statement, BHIC said the reorganisation will see the group divided into three distinct divisions reflecting its principal business activities, namely the defence and security division, the commercial division and the energy division. The reorganisation exercise, which should take some nine months to complete, will also see seven dormant companies in the BHIC Group be liquidated. As the exercise involves only internal entities within the BHIC Group, there will be no material effect on the share capital, earnings, net assets or gearing of BHIC, it said. BHIC (fundamental: 0.45; valuation: 0.3) managing director Tan Sri Ahmad Ramli Mohd Nor said the group recognised that the corporate structure it inherited from its financial restructuring in 2007 was confusing to many of its stakeholders.

The company, which is undergoing a private placement to raise up to RM23.6 million, initially allocated 40.6% of the proceeds to purchase oil and gas equipment with intention to bid for the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) project by Petronas. However, due to weak oil prices and the delay in RAPID project, APFT decided to revise its utilization plans. Accordingly, 60.0% of the proceeds will be used for working capital, 25.4% for aircraft purchase, 13.6% for loan repayment and the balance 1% for proposal expenses. Last Friday, the company announced that it has submitted an application to Bursa Malaysia Securities to extend the deadline of the said private placement to February 2016. The delay in the RAPID project has widened APFT\\u2019s net loss from RM19.7 million in FYMarch2014 to RM22.5 million in FY2015. This was mainly due to impairment of goodwill on consolidation of RM10 million from the acquisition of PT Technic (M) Sdn Bhd (PTTSB), an oil and gas company.

The former prime minister said this in response to a question from the audience at a public lecture in Seri Iskandar, Perak, today. He was asked if he had considered his successors\\u2019 leadership potential before passing on the mantle. The question was asked by Ibrahim Aziz, a former stock broker, at the public lecture on \"Social evolution in Malaysia: what next?\". Explaining his answer, Dr Mahathir also took a dig at his immediate successor, Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, as well as current Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, without mentioning any names. \"We can only guess, when someone is known as 'Mr Clean', we choose lah, but once he entered the arena, he became dirty. \"So I tried to find a cleaner replacement, who knew, this new guy's idea (would be) 'cash is king' and if you give people money, they will like you.\\u201d In a veiled attack at Najib, Dr Mahathir said: \"But in giving money to people, we must have money.

The prevalent uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook pressured the FBM KLCI to hit a three-year low to close down 1.52% or 24.28 points to 1,572.54 \\u2014 the lowest closing price since June 7, 2012. The benchmark index was hovering between 1,594.46 and 1,569.19 throughout the day. There was also no respite for the ringgit, in part due to China\\u2019s yuan devaluation, as the local currency further weakened to close at 4.1020 against the US dollar yesterday, after touching an intraday high of 4.1370. An analyst with HLIB Research sees the KLCI hovering around 1,500 points in the near term. \\u201cShould the benchmark index touch a low of 1,480 points, a technical rebound is expected to happen,\\u201d he told digitaledge DAILY. A head of a local research firm,\\u00a0 who declined to be named, said the index\\u2019s decline was a continuation of last week\\u2019s downward trend, spurred by the uncertainty in local politics, fear of a US rate hike, the recent devaluation of the yuan, as well as weak oil prices. \\u201cToday\\u2019s (yesterday\\u2019s) decline may have been further spurred by comments from Petroliam Nasional Bhd (last Friday), stating that it must dip into its cash reserves to fund its capital expenditure,\\u201d he said. Petronas chief executive officer Datuk Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin last week said the national oil company was bracing itself for more challenges ahead as it does not see a reprieve from the low oil prices in the near future. Reuters reported that oil prices fell toward six-year lows after data showed Japan\\u2019s economy contracted and producers in the US added drilling rigs for a fourth straight week despite a recent rout in prices. Despite the continued decline in the KLCI, the research head said on a fundamental basis, the index is still undervalued, noting that the index is trading at 13.5 times its price-earnings ratio (PER). \\u201cAt 13.5 times PER, it should be valued at 1,600 points and the FBM KLCI traditionally does not trade below 13 times PER in a non-recession year. \\u201cHaving said that, given the current political situation, the catalysts for a rebound would be either a sharp jump in oil prices or a quick resolution to Malaysian politics,\\u201d he said. The research head added that the net foreign inflows since 2011 have already been reversed. The KLCI was not a lone decliner yesterday, as other Asian markets also dipped, with Hong Kong\\u2019s Hang Seng down 0.74% and South Korea\\u2019s Kospi falling 0.75%. In Southeast Asia, Singapore\\u2019s STI fell 1.51%, Thailand\\u2019s SET was down 0.12%, while Indonesia\\u2019s Jakarta Composite Index rose 0.02%. On the ringgit, the research head said the constant weakness is driven by similar factors behind the KLCI\\u2019s decline, adding that the currency is undervalued. \\u201cFundamentally, everything is undervalued. There may be a slowing of economic growth due to the political uncertainty but at the moment there is no sign of a recession and thus markets and the ringgit are both undervalued,\\u201d he said. AmBank FX Research noted that the ringgit had led the decline in Asian currencies last week, followed by the yuan and Singapore dollar. \\u201cThe ringgit fell 3.5% against the US dollar to be the top loser among Asian currencies to trade a high of 4.12 in response to the depreciation pressure of the Chinese currency, falling commodity prices, record high cross SGD/MYR of 2.9346 and sharp sell down in local equity markets. \\u201cThe one-month volatility also touched a record high of 15.74% last Friday compared with historical average of 7.8% as the one-month NDF (non-deliverables forward) rate tested a high of 4.1450. \\u201cThe better-than-expected second-quarter 2015 gross domestic product growth of 4.9% and current account surplus of RM7.6 billion (expectations of RM6.1 billion), however, failed to keep markets on the optimistic side of the equation,\\u201d said the research house.

The land was independently valued at RM261 million as at April 3, it noted.

Barakah Offshore Petroleum Bhd has bagged a two-year contract worth an estimated RM30 million from Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd, to provide cleaning pig and associated services in East Malaysia. In a filing with Bursa today, Barakah (fundamental: 1.95; valuation: 0.3) said its wholly-owned subsidiary PBJV Group Sdn Bhd has received the letter of award from Petronas Carigali. The actual contract value, however, depends on the actual work orders issued by Petronas Carigali during the tenure. The contract also carries a one-year extension option to June 25, 2018. Malaysia Smelting Corp Bhd (MSC) narrowed its losses by 49% to RM14.91 million in the second quarter 2015 (2QFY15), compared with last year\\u2019s RM28.83 million, as revenue expanded on higher sales of refined tin. Revenue came in at RM452.98 million, up 5% from RM431.71 in the preceding quarter, according to its filing to Bursa today. However, it announced a loss before tax from continuing operations of RM19.2 million for 2QFY15, compared with a profit of RM6 million in the same period last year, due to a significant increase in the non-cash adjustments linked to the unfavourable valuation of its Butterworth smelter\\u2019s closing stock of in-plant inventory. A major portion of this inventory is recirculating stock in the smelting operations; and a downward adjustment in inventory value pegged to lower tin prices has contributed to the bulk of its losses in 1HFY15. MSC's (fundamental: 0.55; valuation: 0.3) earnings were also affected by the negative impact of foreign currency translation, due to ringgit depreciation. Its cumulative first half 2015 (2HFY15)\\u2019s net loss expanded 25% to RM17.8 million, from last year\\u2019s RM14.2 million; while 1HFY15 revenue dropped 3% to RM834.62 million, from RM860.81 million last year.

Its 2QFY15 revenue grew more than four times to RM53.66 million, from RM10.78 million in 2QFY14, on revenue generated by its jack-up drilling rig and Perisai Pacific 101. But Perisai\\u00a0 (fundamental: 0.65; valuation: 1.1) revealed it is exploring the possibility of deferring taking delivery of a second jack up rig until it secures a rig contract for it, as demand for offshore assets within Southeast Asia has softened, due to capital expenditure cuts among exploration and production companies. Meanwhile, in its cumulative six months (1HFY15), Perisai Petroleum returned to charting a net profit of RM8.64 million or 0.72 sen per share, as compared to a loss of RM2.03 million or 18 sen per share in 1HFY14; while revenue leapt to RM110.39 million, from RM21.65 million previously. The group attributed the improved earnings to drilling operations which began in August 2014 with the new jack-up drilling rig Perisai Pacific 101 (PP 101), a higher share of contributions from joint ventures and associates, higher forex gain and higher finance cost. Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Bhd's net profit for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2QFY15) declined 8.2% on-year to RM38.95 million, from RM42.44 million previously, mainly on lower surplus transfer from both family and general takaful.

In the first half of FY15 (1HFY15), it\\u2019s net profit was RM85.17 million or 10.45 sen per share, up 9.9% from RM77.52 million or 9.52 sen per share a year ago, mainly on higher wakalah fee income. Revenue in 1HFY15 also improved 16.2% to RM995.99 million, as compared with RM856.83 million in 1HFY14, on higher sales from both family and general takaful business, and higher net investment income. Press Metal Bhd\\u2019s net profit for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2QFY15) plunged nearly 59% to RM24.73 million or 1.91 sen per share, from RM60.03 million or 11.57 sen per share last year, on unrealised foreign exchange (forex) losses. Press Metal (fundamental: 0.95; valuation: 2) said the sharply lower earnings was due to a RM50.5 million unrealised forex losses recorded for the quarter under review, arising the group's US dollar-denominated loans.\n\\u00a0\nRevenue for the quarter was down 5.27% to RM947.26 million, from RM1 billion a year ago, on lower sales from its Samalaju Smelting Plant, after it shutdown in May due to a fire. \\u00a0 The group declared a second interim dividend of 1.5 sen, payable on Sept 10.

Quarterly revenue dropped by 0.77% to RM11.59 million, from RM11.68 million in 2QFY14, Landmarks said in a filing to the Bursa today. For the six months ended June 30, Landmarks' (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 0.9) net loss declined slightly to RM5.31 million, from RM5.43 million last year; while cumulative revenue grew 5.5% to RM30.9 million, from RM29.3 million a year ago. For the six-month period, Landmarks said the resort and destination development division recorded an operating loss of RM9.29 million, compared with RM9.19 million in the corresponding period of 2014. The higher net loss was mainly due to the pre-operating expenses for Phase 1, Chill Cove, Treasure Bay Bintan, it added. Hong Leong Bank Bhd (HLB) has proposed to undertake a renounceable rights issue to raise up to RM3 billion for the group\\u2019s working capital and banking purposes. Meanwhile, its parent Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd (HLFG) which owns 64.23% of HLB, is also making a cash call to raise money to subscribe to its banking arm\\u2019s proposed rights issue. In the filing to Bursa, HLFG said based on its direct shareholdings of 64.23% in HLB and the intended gross proceeds of up to RM3 billion to be raised from its consumer banking arm\\u2019s rights issue, the capital outlay required by HLFG to fully subscribe its entitlements is expected to be about RM1.9 billion. On HLB\\u2019s (fundamental: 2.8; valuation: 2.2) proposed rights issue, the bank said the entitlement basis is assumed to be nine rights shares for every 55 HLB shares held by shareholders. The bank also said the issue price for the shares have not been fixed at this juncture. In a separate filing, HLFG said the entitlement basis is assumed to be three rights shares for every 34 HLFG shares held by shareholders. It also said the issue price is assumed to be RM11.84, which represents a discount of RM3.28 or 21.69% to the TERP of RM15.12, based on the five-day VWAMP of HLFG shares, up to and including the LPD of RM15.41. The proposed rights issue will enlarge HLFG\\u2019s issued and paid-up share capital to 1.15 billion shares, from 1.05 billion shares. Flexible packaging manufacturer Daibochi Plastic and Packaging Industry Bhd\\u2019s net profit rose 15.7% to RM7.19 million in its second quarter ended June 30(2QFY15), from RM6.22 million a year ago, on higher export sales and a favourable product mix. Its latest quarterly revenue came in 3.1% higher at RM89.67 million, from RM86.98 million in 2QFY14, according to its filing with Bursa Malaysia today. Daibochi (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 1.1) also declared a second interim single tier dividend of 4 sen per share, in respect of the financial year ending Dec 31, 2015 (FY15), payable on Sept 29.

Property developer cum apparel retailer Wing Tai Malaysia Bhd\\u2019s net profit in its fourth quarter ended June 30, 2015 (4QFY15) fell 41.8% to RM17.3 million or 5.46 sen per share, from RM29.7 million or 9.44 sen per share a year ago, as revenue was considerably weaker. Its latest quarterly revenue has more than halved to RM66.5 million, from RM146.6 million, according to its quarterly report to Bursa today. Wing Tai said lower revenue from the property development division was mainly attributable to the sale of Plaza DNP in FY14, and lower revenue recognition for its Verticas Residensi project in the current financial year. Its profit margins from the retail segment also came under pressure from higher import cost due to weaker ringgit, compounded by weaker consumer spending. Despite weak financials, Wing Tai (fundamental: 1.05; valuation: 2.4) recommended a first and final dividend of 3 sen per share for the financial year ended June 30 (FY15), amounting to RM14.2 million (FY14: 5 sen per share, with a special dividend of 2 sen per share; totaling RM22 million). Meanwhile, for the full FY15, Wing Tai\\u2019s net profit declined a marginal 1.52% to RM69.6 million or 22.06 sen per share, from RM70.7 million or 22.49 sen per share; while revenue fell 27.2% to RM316.3 million against RM434.6 million in FY14. Separately, Wing Tai announced it has appointed Christopher Chong Lye Sun, 48, as its new chief financial officer to replace Lee Kong Beng, 64, who has resigned to pursue other interests. Nestle Malaysia Bhd (Nestle)'s profit rose 5% to RM123.9 million in its second quarter ended June 30 (2QFY15), from RM118.48 million a year ago, on lower costs and cheaper raw material prices. However, revenue shrank 10% to RM1.14 billion, from RM1.27 billion last year, on weaker consumer spending post-implementation of the goods and services tax (GST), which saw its domestic sales slide 2%. Overall, exports were also lower by 5%. Nestle (fundamental:1.75; valuation: 1.5) declared an interim dividend of 65 sen per share, which amounted to a payout of RM152.43 million, payable on Sept 10. The stock will go ex-dividend on Aug 26. Meanwhile, its cumulative six months (1HFY15)\\u2019s net profit rose 3% to RM311.78 million, from RM302.01 million a year ago, on a healthier profit structure, lower costs and cheaper raw material prices. However, Nestle\\u2019s revenue for its first half 2015 (1HFY15) dropped 5% to RM2.42 billion, from RM2.54 billion last year, again mostly due to weaker consumer spending. The world\\u2019s largest condom manufacturer Karex Bhd has proposed to purchase loss-making company Medical-Latex (Dua) Sdn Bhd (MLD) from Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft AG for RM13 million cash. Karex told Bursa that the acquisition, expected to be completed by early October, will be financed by the proceeds raised from its private placement exercise completed in March this year.

MyEG Capital currently has an 80% stake in Car X\\u2019s, while the remaining 20% is held by Bridge Barn\\u2019s shareholder, Jason Chan Ling Khee. In a filing with Bursa, MyEG said MyEG Capital has entered into a shareholders agreement with Bridge Barn, Car X, Chan and Dr Ng Kee Aun to develop, manage and expand Car X, the company behind MyMotor. The deal was primarily to bring Dr Ng, one of the directors of Bridge Barn, and the co-founder of Motor Trader magazine, on board Car X.

Petronas Gas Bhd (PGB) management indicated that the RM407.4 million deferred tax assets (DTA) arising from the investment tax allowance granted for the plant rejuvenation and revamp project that was recognised in the second quarter of financial year 2015 (2QFY15) is a one-off item. There is no further major tax incentives (apart from the tax exemption for the utilities segment). We also understand that the sharp drop in associate and joint venture (JV) income in 2QFY15 (RM3.3 million versus RM23.8 million in 1QFY15 was mainly due to Kimanis, which was negatively impacted by an unrealised loss from the revaluation of long-term forex contracts. Their utilities segment was also impacted by a plant shutdown. The 1.7% year-on-year (y-o-y) contraction in 2QFY15 revenue was mostly due to lower sales booked by utilities. The segment\\u2019s sales fell by RM26.1 million compared with 2QFY15. Apart from the impact of lower electricity tariff, the segment was negatively impacted by plant shutdowns, resulting in lower off-take of industrial gases. Management indicated that it is just regular planned maintenance shutdowns. No further maintenance shutdowns are planned in the second half (2HFY15). Management expects utilities sales to play catch-up in the remainder of the year. PGB\\u2019s throughput services also benefited from the higher base income. In 1HFY15, the gas processing revenue rose 4.3%, thanks to higher capacity reservation fee under the new gas processing agreement, which came into effect on April 1, 2014. We understand that the group also managed to achieve the overall equipment effectiveness target for two months in 2QFY15, resulting in it being able to claim the PBS incentives. Coupled with lower cost, gross profit of this segment rose 14.5% y-o-y in 1HFY15. Meanwhile, the gas transportation segment booked a 4% y-o-y increase in 1HFY15 revenue, benefiting from higher capacity booking under the new gas transportation agreement. The incremental revenue added RM19 million to the group\\u2019s gross profit. FY15 earnings estimate upgraded 22% after imputing the RM407.4 million DTA recognised in 2QFY15. FY16 and FY17 earnings forecasts were upgraded 0.9% and 1.2% respectively, to take into account the better- than-expected contribution from the gas transportation segment. With the improved cash flow on the back of a lower tax burden, the FY15 dividend estimate adjusted higher to 65 sen per share (59% payout ratio).

The group also declared an interim dividend of 14 sen per share for the quarter, to be paid on Sep 22, 2015, its filing with Bursa Malaysia today showed. PetDag said the lower operating expenditure was mainly due to lower bonus provision for its financial year ending Dec 31, 2015 (FY15) resulting in lower manpower expenses for the current quarter. Lower advertising and promotions expenses, together with other cost reduction efforts, also contributed to the lower operating expenditure. The group also attributed its increase in profitability for the quarter to higher margin contribution from both its retail and commercial segments. However, PetDag\\u2019s latest quarterly revenue dropped 22% to RM6.49 billion from RM8.37 billion in 2QFY14, as average selling price fell 17%, coupled with a 6% decline in sales volume.

Loss-making AirAsia X Bhd, which will fly four times a week from Kuala Lumpur to Sapporo, Japan, starting Oct 1, 2015, is banking on new routes to help it improve its revenue and turn itself around in the second half of this year, said its acting chief executive officer Benyamin Ismail. The low-cost, long-haul affiliate of AirAsia Bhd plans to next launch its first US flights to Hawaii in November, to fill a gap left by the axing of routes to Nagoya, Narita and Adelaide this year. Benyamin said AirAsia X targets to carry close to 100,000 passengers on the Kuala Lumpur-Sapporo route in the first year of operations. The new route is in addition to its existing flights to Osaka and Tokyo. \"To make sure that we achieve good profitability (on the route), we have to make sure that we achieve 75% to 80% (of average load factor),\\u201d Benyamin told a press conference to announce its new flights from Kuala Lumpur to Sapporo today. As part of its restructuring plan, the loss-making airline is dropping some of its unprofitable flights and slowing its aircraft deliveries. \\u201cWe will cut routes that are not performing and where the market is already oversupplied,\\u201d Ismail said. \\u201cBut that doesn\\u2019t stop us from investing into new routes. The message to the team is to look at routes that we think are profitable,\\u201d he added. Automotive stocks such as Cycle & Carriage Bintang Bhd and Berjaya Auto Bhd (BAuto) may come into focus tomorrow, after the Malaysia Automotive Association (MAA) trimmed this year's total industry volume (TIV) to 670,000 units from 680,000 units earlier amid a challenging economic outlook. Its president Datuk Aishah Ahmad said the revision after considering many factors, include ongoing inflationary pressures, fluctuations in oil and commodity prices, foreign exchange rate volatility, subdued business optimism and moderation in consumer's spending due to economic uncertainties and increasing cost of living. She added that more stringent lending practices such as hire purchase loans among financial institutions do not help the sentiment. Nevertheless, she expects the sentiment to improve in the second half of 2015 as consumers adjust to the effect of the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST), which she said will return to \"new spending normalcy\". In the first half of this year, sales volume declined 3.3% to 322,184 units from 333,156 units a year ago on falling sales in passenger and commercial vehicles, which dropped by 3.5% and 2% respectively. For 2016, Aishah expects TIV to grow by 2% to 683,400 units. Alam Maritim Resources Bhd's unit Alam Maritim (M) Sdn Bhd has bagged a RM6 million contract to provide splash zone structural repair and maintenance to Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd. Alam Maritim (fundamental: 1.6; valuation: 1.5) told Bursa Malaysia today that the contract is for a period of two years, effective from June 8, 2015 until June 7, 2017. The contract also comes with an extension option of one year, to June 7, 2018. The sub-sea engineering and offshore oil and gas (O&G) services provider expects the contract to contribute positively to its earnings and net tangible assets for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2015 and beyond. Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd (MHB) saw its net profit for the second financial quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2QFY15) fall 55% to RM18.03 million from RM39.73 million a year ago, on lower income from its O&G structure construction unit. MHB (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 1.1) said its revenue was also down 40.65% to RM582.14 million versus RM980.92 million in 2QFY14. The group noted its offshore segment registered lower revenue and operating profit, as most projects have been completed or sailed away while the newly-secured projects are still at the early stage of its project life cycle. Its marine segment's revenue and operating profit is higher against corresponding quarter, mainly due to higher value of vessels repaired, especially from rigs/special vessels, FSU (floating storage unit) and general cargo categories. For the six-month period (1HFY15), MHB's net profit fell to RM54.05 million from RM74.36 million a year earlier. Revenue was lower at RM1.3 billion compared with RM1.65 billion. Looking ahead, MHB said it is mindful of uncertainties in the O&G industry, amid low crude oil prices. The group said it had seen projects being deferred, due to the uncertainties. Property developer Talam Transform Bhd is targeting new launches in the financial year ending Jan 31, 2017 (FY17). \"We are in the midst of getting approvals from the authorities to be able to build again,\" its executive director Chua Kim Lan told reporters after the group's annual general meeting today. Elaborating on the type of new launches, she said they would comprise landed and condominium projects in Ulu Klang and Selayang, Selangor, but declined to reveal the gross development value (GDV) of these launches. Talam Transform (fundamental: 0.35; valuation: 0.9) currently has a total land bank of about 1,200 acres in Selangor, with a GDV of RM5 billion to RM6 billion. Fajarbaru Builder Group expects a double-digit growth in its earnings and revenue starting from the financial year ending June 30, 2017 (FY17), driven by upcoming property launches and strong unbilled order book from its construction segment. Speaking at a press conference today, Fajarbaru's executive director Ooi Leng Chooi said the group intends to undertake three residential development projects in the country with a combined GDV of RM728 million. The group has an unbilled order book of RM450 million, which will keep it busy for the next two years. It is also tendering some RM500 million worth of projects. Ooi said the projects in the pipeline include a condominium in Bandar Kinrara, Puchong (RM400 million GDV); a serviced apartment in Sentul (RM250 million GDV); and serviced apartments in Pulau Melaka (RM78 million GDV). \"We will be launching our Puchong project by the end of this year, followed by Sentul and Pulau Melaka, which will be launched in the first quarter and third quarter of 2016, respectively,\" he added. Fajarbaru (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 1.8) is also expected to start recognising contributions from its maiden overseas property project, the \"Gardenhill Condominium\" in Melbourne, by end of next year or early 2017. IGB Real Estate Investment Trust (IGB REIT), the manager of Mid Valley Megamall and The Gardens Mall in Kuala Lumpur, announced that its distributable income rose 11.7% to RM75.45 million in the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2QFY15) from RM67.54 million a year ago. It said the distributable income, which translates to a distribution per unit (DPU) of 2.18 sen per unit, consists of realised profit of RM65.8 million and the non-cash adjustment arising mainly from manager fee payable in units of RM8.2 million. This brings its half year (1HFY15) DPU to 4.47 sen per unit (1HFY14: 3.89 sen), which will be paid on Aug 28, and represents 100% of its RM155.05 million distributable income for the half year period, which is up 15.54% from 1HFY14's RM134.2 million. Looking forward, IGB REIT (fundamental: 2.8; valuation: 0.65) is unfazed with the challenging operating environment in the retail sector. \"Given the current satisfactory performance of its existing business portfolio, the REIT's operational results for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2015 (FY15) are expected to be satisfactory,\" it added. Jiankun International Bhd plans a 377-unit serviced apartment with an estimated GDV of RM180 million on a piece of freehold land measuring approximately 0.81ha in Daerah Petaling, Selangor. The development, Jiankun said, will be undertaken by its unit JKI Development Sdn Bhd together with the land owner Five Star Development (Puchong) Sdn Bhd. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Jiankun (fundamental: 0.6; valuation: 0.9) said Five Star agrees to grant JKI the exclusive right to develop and construct the proposed development in return for 20% of the GDV, estimated to be RM36 million. Jiankun said the sole cost and expense of construction will be borne by JKI, which is estimated to be RM147.20 million, inclusive of Five Star's entitlement. \"The construction cost is to be funded via a combination of bank borrowings and proceeds from its rights issue on Dec 31, 2014,\" it added. Only World Group Holdings Bhd (OWG) is acquiring a 60% stake in Escaperoom Holdings Sdn Bhd (EHSB) for RM5.4 million as part of its expansion strategy and long-term objectives of becoming a market leader in the leisure and hospitality industry. OWG today signed a conditional share sale agreement (SSA) with EHSB shareholders Datuk Ong Kee Seng, Datuk Victor Lo Tung Ho and Datuk Leung Chak Sum Jason. EHSB is principally engaged in real-life physical adventure games. On funding, OWG said the acquisition would be funded entirely by its internal funds. Under the SSA, EHSB would guarantee a RM4 million net profit for two financial years ending June 30, 2016 (FY16) and FY17. Perusahaan Sadur Timah Malaysia Bhd's (Perstima) net profit for the first quarter ended June 30, 2015 (1QFY16) rise 62.8% to RM9.31 million or 9.38 sen per share from RM5.72 million or 5.76 sen per share a year ago, on higher profit margin coupled with higher sales volume. The tin plate manufacturer said its revenue for the quarter increased 6.38% to RM158.35 million from RM148.85 million. Going forward, Perstima said operating environment will become more challenging and competitive due to greater presence of imports from overseas and the weakening of the ringgit against the US dollar. Despite this, it said it will continue with its cost saving measures and is confident that the profitability of the group for the financial year ending March 31, 2016 (FY16) will be satisfactory. Caring Pharmacy Group Bhd's net profit more than doubled to RM2.63 million or 2 sen per share for its fourth financial quarter ended May 31, 2015 (4QFY15) from RM1.28 million or 0.59 sen per share a year earlier. This was contributed by new store openings and revenue growth from existing outlets. Revenue for 4QFY15 rose 8% to RM95.41 million from RM88.64 million in 4QFY14. It also declared final dividend of 2 sen per share for the financial year ended May 31, 2015 (FY15), pending to shareholders' approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting. Despite noting the implementation of the GST in April has dampened consumer sentiment, Caring remained cautiously optimistic of its performance for the next financial year. Education service provider SEG International Bhd (SEGi) saw its net profit for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2QFY15) grow 18.1% to RM7.96 million or 1.16 sen per share from RM6.74 or 1.05 sen per share a year ago, due to better product mix and demand for higher-end programmes. It told Bursa Malaysia today that its revenue for the period was RM65.07 million, up 5.3% from RM61.81 million in 2QFY14. For the first half period (6MFY15), SEGi's net profit expanded by 34.6% to RM18.78 million or 2.76 sen per share from RM13.95 million or 2.17 sen per share. Revenue for 6MFY15 was at RM132.43 million, up 7.4% from RM123.33 million a year ago. SEGi (fundamental: 1.8; valuation: 1.1) said it has launched a number of new initiatives in the last two years that have a strong foundation for growth. \"With this in place, the group expects its financial performance to improve further for this and the coming years,\" it added. Property developer EcoFirst Consolidated Bhd has return to profitability in its fourth financial quarter ended May 31, 2015 (4QFY15), with a net profit of RM4.68 million or 0.64 sen per share underpinned by higher income from its retail malls and its condominium development in Ipoh, Perak known as \"Upper East @ Tiger Lane\". It posted a net loss of RM3.89 million or 0.6 sen per share in 4QFY14. Revenue for 4QFY15 grew 560.64% to RM42.06 million, mainly from the recurring income from the two retail malls of the group and the Upper East @ Tiger Lane, in Ipoh, which is progressing according to schedule. For the full year FY15, its net profit fell 79.63% to RM6.13 million or 0.87 sen per share from RM30.11 million or 4.63 sen per share in FY14. Moving forward, EcoFirst (fundamental: 0; valuation: 0.3) said rental income from the two retail malls will continue to form a substantial source of recurring income for the group.

In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Alam Maritim (fundamental:1.6; valuation: 1.5) said its wholly-owned subsidiary Alam Maritim (M) Sdn Bhd has recently received a Letter of Award from Petronas Carigali for the contract. \"The contract is for a period of two years, effective from June 8, 2015 until June 7, 2017 with an extension option of one year, from June 8, 2017 to June 7, 2018,\" the sub-sea engineering and offshore oil and gas services provider said. On financial impact, Alam Maritim expects the contract to contribute positively to its earnings and net tangible assets for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2015 and beyond. For the first financial quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1QFY15), Alam Maritim's net profit was down by 45% to RM8.59 million against RM15.59 million a year ago, due to lower average utilisation rate of offshore support vessels (OSV) and lower revenue from the offshore installation and construction (OIC) segment. It said profitability of the OSV segment was lower by 34.7%, primarily due to lower average utilisation rate of OSV. Revenue for the quarter came in 6.88% lower at RM73.71 million, as compared to RM79.15 million last year. Nevertheless, the group is confident the O&G sector should be able to withstand short term uncertainties and sustain with solid fundamentals in the long run. At 12.30pm midday break, the counter fell 0.5 sen or 0.98% at 50.5 sen, bringing its market capitalisation to RM471.48 million.

The tender, which was held by Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB), is said to have closed on June 26. Although not set in stone, this would indicate that these three bids will be favoured over those by TSR Capital Bhd in a JV with Daewoo Group and the Seacera Group Bhd-Spaz Sdn Bhd-Sinohydro Corp-Shanghai Construction Group consortium. It is learnt that another bidder, IJM Corp Bhd in partnership with Norwest Holdings Sdn Bhd and Shimizu Corp of Japan, pulled out earlier. Some of the smaller players, it seems, could not even come up with the performance bonds, which make up a small percentage of the contract value. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a closely contested affair \\u2026 the pricing is very close. PNB will need to scrutinise the details of the bids before selecting the winner,\\u201d a source says, adding that Malaysia\\u2019s leading investment conglomerate will take a holistic view of the bidders \\u2014 how they performed in previous contracts and if they had faced any problems in past awards \\u2014 before giving out the RM5 billion contract for the 610m tower. While all the construction companies have issues, some of their problems stand out more than the others. MRCB (fundamental: 1.30; valuation: 1.40) has definitely blossomed under Tan Sri Mohamad Salim Fateh Din but it is still saddled with the Eastern Dispersal Link Expressway, said to be the most expensive highway built in the country. In its first quarter ended March 31, 2015, the company posted a net profit of RM237.9 million on revenue of RM404.2 million. \\u00a0 While many say UEM-Samsung is one of the favourites to bag the job, the delays at klia2 will weigh on the bid. \\u00a0 UEM\\u2019s arm UEM Construction Sdn Bhd and its partner Bina Puri Holdings Bhd took a lot of flak for the holdup at klia2. While certain quarters blamed budget airline AirAsia Bhd for changing the specifications of the airport, fingers were pointed at UEM as well. UEM and Bina Puri had the job of building the main terminal building, the satellite building, the piers and the sky-bridge. Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd\\u00a0 officials have said the liquidated and ascertained damages that could be charged to UEM-Bina Puri for the delay could be around RM60 million. There is also talk of UEM selling its construction outfit UEM Builders Bhd, which raises the question as to how it will execute its portion of the work. Nevertheless, UEM, which is wholly owned by state-controlled investment arm Khazanah Nasional Bhd, posted an after-tax profit of RM1.1 billion on revenue of RM8.9 billion in its financial year ended Dec 31, 2013 (FY2013). It had current assets of RM10.2 billion and non-current assets of RM9.5 billion. On the other side of the balance sheet, the company had long-term debt commitments of RM5.3 billion and short-term borrowings of RM4.4 billion. The provision of engineering-based infrastructure and services is UEM\\u2019s mainstay and it has an established track record and global operations, having delivered key projects for the public and private sectors, including expressways, bridges, buildings, urban transit, water infrastructure, airports, hospitals, township and property developments, and asset and facility management. Samsung, meanwhile, had participated in the building of many of the world\\u2019s tallest skyscrapers, including the 452m Petronas Twin Towers and the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, currently the tallest building in the world at 828m and 163 storeys high. WCT\\u2019s partner Arabtec, in partnership with Belgium\\u2019s Besix, was among the key players in the building of the Burj Khalifa, which was officially opened in January 2010. However, Arabtec had some issues when its CEO Hasan Ismaik suddenly left the company in June last year. The talk then was that there was a fallout between him and Aabar Investments, a large shareholder of Arabtec. After buying Ismaik\\u2019s stock, Aabar Investments has just under 35% of Arabtec. \\u00a0 Ismaik was the driving force behind Arabtec\\u2019s expansion and aggression, thus his departure could have adversely affected the company. China\\u2019s construction industry has been badly hit by the recent bankruptcy of the Baha Mar resort in the Bahamas. Although not very clear, the unit involved could be owned by China State Construction Engineering. News reports have it that delays in completing the project brought about an inability to generate funds, which, in turn, resulted in the bankruptcy. The US$3.5 billion project was slated for completion late last year but was extended to March this year. The other companies involved are likely to have some issues as well. The Edge had reported in May that industry players had picked the WCT-Arabtec JV and the UEM-Samsung partnership as the front runners in the bidding for KL118. However, the MRCB-China State Construction Engineering bid cannot be taken lightly.  This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on July 6 - 12, 2015."}, "468": {"date_posted": "24/7/2015", "title": "Cover Story: IBs brace for prolonged dry spell", "article": " IN a challenging and frustratingly slow year for the country\\u2019s investment banks (IBs), many have been forced to re-look their strategies. Nevertheless, the IBs still see opportunities despite the competitive industry landscape. An initial public offering (IPO)\\u00a0 drought \\u2014 there have been only three listings so far this year \\u2014 and a slowdown in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and other fundraising activities in the capital market since the second half of last year have left IBs considerably less busy. \\u201cWe\\u2019re seeing investment bankers clocking out [of the office] before nightfall ... a telling sign of how slow things are,\\u201d an official at one of the larger IBs tells The Edge. The slowdown has affected the earnings of some of the major banks. And like many of the global IBs, some have resorted to retrenching staff or moving them to overseas offices that are still growing \\u2014 instead of recruiting new workers \\u2014 in a bid to contain costs. CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, for example, which has one of the largest Asia-Pacific-based IB franchises, started cutting its workforce in the investment banking division in February. \\u201cThe realities of today\\u2019s capital markets require us to recalibrate,\\u201d it had said then. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a case of too many IBs chasing too few deals. Fees are coming down because IBs are undercutting each other to clinch deals, which are not even large ones \\u2014 those are rare these days \\u2014 but more small-to-mid-sized ones,\\u201d says a veteran investment banker. The slowdown, especially in deal value, is not unique to Malaysia, but seen throughout the region, bankers say. In the first quarter of this year, net revenue from investment banking in Southeast Asia (SEA) dropped to US$238 million (RM893.4 million) from US$300 million in the previous corresponding quarter, according to Dealogic, a firm that tracks such data. This followed a weak 2014 for investment banking in SEA, with net revenue falling to US$1.3 billion from US$1.7 billion in 2012, when the region was a hotbed for deals. Bankers say the overall sentiment in the region has definitely been less upbeat, with investors and corporates affected by uncertainties in global markets and the volatility of regional currencies and commodity prices. Political risk also seems to be a common theme in Asean this year, notes Affin Hwang Capital group managing director (MD) Maimoonah Hussain. \\u201cIn Malaysia, IPO [activity] has declined considerably and secondary fundraising has also been down. Looking at the level of rights issues, capital-raising dropped more than 50% this year compared with last year. The only bright spot is M&A, which hasn\\u2019t dropped that much, but if you share the pie among the IBs, this is not big income. Fees for corporate advisory and M&A are generally non-big ticket unless it\\u2019s an M&A that comes with funding,\\u201d says Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd (HLIB) MD and CEO Lee Jim Leng. The situation is not expected to improve any-time soon despite initial expectations that the capital markets will pick up in 2H2015. The Edge spoke to the heads of six of Malaysia\\u2019s 11 IBs \\u2014 CIMB Investment Bank Bhd, Maybank Investment Bank, RHB Investment Bank Bhd, HLIB, Affin Hwang Capital and Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd \\u2014 and was told that a pick-up in activity was not imminent. They expect the capital markets to see a prolonged period of slow activity and soft sentiment. \\u201cLooking at the indicators, the outlook for the second half of 2015 is not promising, especially for the cash equities business in the nearer term, as the market is going through a period of consolidation,\\u201d says Tengku Datuk Zafrul Aziz, CEO of CIMB IB. \\u201cHowever, this will be partially offset by a better fixed income performance as the corporate bond market continued to trend positively in 1H2015 and will likely see a slightly stronger level of issuances across Asean this year.\\u201d He says the capital market environment was subdued not just in Malaysia but across Asean in 1H2015 as investors generally viewed the region as one asset class. \\u201cThe slowdown in investment banking was perhaps more prominent in Malaysia and Singapore, given the relatively strong deal flows in recent years. Nevertheless, each Asean market has its own challenges and it will take time to address the issues. Having said that, we believe, as in all cycles, the Asean markets will return as economies grow and investments resume,\\u201d he adds.  Tweaking strategies In the meantime, most of the IBs say they have to tweak their strategies to make the best of the longer-than-expected dry spell and position themselves better in anticipation of a recovery. Many are also striving to contain costs at this time. \\u201cObviously, the outlook isn\\u2019t promising, so we can\\u2019t rely on the traditional ways of doing business anymore. We\\u2019re reinventing the wheel ... doing more new things in the market like unrated debt papers. The big funds have a good appetite for such papers,\\u201d says Roslan Tik, Kenanga IB\\u2019s executive director and head of group investment banking and Islamic banking. Non-bank-backed Kenanga IB is one of the smaller IBs in the country. \\u201cOur size actually works to our advantage because we are nimble and have the agility to adjust and respond more easily to market conditions,\\u201d says Roslan. \\u201cCorporate activities like financing, IPOs and M&A in the small and mid-cap sectors are still quite vibrant. Kenanga IB is focused in this space. In fact, in recent times, some of the larger IBs have moved into this space because of the lack of deals in the big-cap sector.\\u201d Indeed, industry sources say the small IBs are coping better in this slow period because they are able to continue to tap the small corporates that big IBs had ignored in better times. But the big regional IBs also have an advantage in that they are able to pursue deals in other markets like Thailand and Indonesia, where deal flows are relatively better, especially in the IPO space. Roslan says Kenanga IB has adequate deal flows in the pipeline to keep it busy in the next 12 months. \\u201cOur pipeline is very much equity driven. We are still optimistic about the market. The liquidity is there, but what has been missing in the last six months was investor confidence and trust. It goes back to the basic requirement of integrity and credibility of the issuer.\\u201d CIMB IB, which regularly tops the investment banking league table, says it is important that it retains its leadership position in these tough times. \\u201cOur focus is to ensure that we continue to retain our position so that when the markets turn bullish, we are there to capture the opportunities. Hence, as the markets slow down, we will pursue revenues from non-capital market activities and increase regional and cross-border M&A activities in view of moderating valuations and distressed situations. At the same time, we are also actively containing our costs and reviewing our operating cost base,\\u201d CIMB IB\\u2019s Tengku Zafrul says.  HLIB\\u2019s Lee doesn\\u2019t think IBs should focus on being the best in all business segments in these difficult times. \\u201cIt\\u2019s no longer relevant to be everything to everyone in these times of declining market revenue. Increasingly, people are concentrating on things that they do best. They\\u2019re looking for niches that they can build on rather than being a leader of everything. They need to reinvent themselves.\\u201d She says product innovation is important for HLIB. \\u201cProducts work based on different environments, different cycles. We have to be innovative and look at what works best for our clients.\\u201d RHB IB CEO Mike Chan points out that no matter the market cycle, investment banking is a long-haul business. He says IBs should use this downtime to \\u201crefocus\\u201d. \\u201cFor RHB, we take this year to basically look through our internal structure, do some cost optimisation and relook at the business model to make us more efficient. We\\u2019ve tweaked our business model slightly to focus more on coverage as one of the pillars, giving more emphasis to relationship management. All the capital market activities like ECM (equity capital market), DCM (debt capital market), institutional and retail equities, asset management, sales and trading and advisory ... these are the key pillars that we will deepen our capabilities in across the region.\\u201d Affin Hwang Capital says it has always positioned its business for the long term. \\u201cWe do not believe in second-guessing short-term cycles and macroeconomic gyrations nor do we build our strategy around short-term goals or market conditions. Our overall strategy is about revenue growth and cost control over a period of five years,\\u201d says Maimoonah. \\u201cThe theme is to build resilience across our businesses, to position [them] such that whether it\\u2019s a good year or a bad year, we keep our seat at the table.\\u201d Silver lining Despite the current gloomy environment, bankers say there are still opportunities. \\u201cThere are some bright spots in capital-raising, particularly to fund infrastructure projects. We expect many of these projects to be financed through the debt capital market, sukuk issuances, project financing or loan syndication,\\u201d says Maybank IB CEO John Chong, who is also CEO of Maybank Kim Eng. Some of the group\\u2019s clients have managed to lock in rates successfully for Islamic and conventional bonds, he says. \\u201cIt is a matter of identifying potential windows for pricing and launching the transactions.\\u201d Overall, the group still has a healthy pipeline of potential deals, he adds. \\u201cHaving said that, the conversion of these deals will depend very much on the issuers\\u2019 decision, market condition and timing.\\u201d CIMB IB, too, notes that there has been continued growth in infrastructure investments across Asean, which will translate into fundraising opportunities for IBs. \\u201cThe demand for sovereign and corporate debt issuances remains strong, and CIMB has been involved in several landmark sukuk issuances by Malaysia and Indonesia as well as corporate issuers like Petronas,\\u201d says Tengku Zafrul. Despite the weak market outlook, CIMB IB\\u2019s deal pipeline remains \\u201crelatively healthy\\u201d, he adds. The big IBs believe M&A activity will pick up, given that valuation levels have come down somewhat. \\u201cM&A is something that we see is going to ramp up in Asean, so we have strengthened the team that focuses on that business. There\\u2019s a lot of demand in the areas of education, healthcare, fast-moving goods and oil and gas downstream activities, which are infrastructure-related, like tank farms and so on,\\u201d says RHB IB\\u2019s Chan. He notes that as global IBs cut back in the region, there are opportunities for Malaysia\\u2019s top three regional banks \\u2014 CIMB IB, Maybank IB and RHB IB \\u2014 to grab big M&A deals that global players used to dominate. As for IPOs, the outlook remains uncertain, but Thailand and Indonesia seem to be bucking the trend. Maimoonah notes that Thailand saw eight IPOs in the first quarter alone. And although Indonesia has had only three so far this year, 32 others are in the pipeline. \\u201cWhether these materialise or not, given that we are already halfway through the year, it remains to be seen.\\u201d Malaysia and Singapore are among the weakest in terms of IPO volumes. Malaysia has two slated for listing this week, bringing the total to just five so far this year. These include last month\\u2019s listing of Malakoff Corp Bhd \\u2014 the biggest \\u2014 which raised RM2.7 billion and was heavily oversubscribed by institutional investors. However, the stock failed to shine upon listing. Singapore had only two listings this year \\u2014 crushed limestone producer GCCP Resources Ltd and property management group LHN Ltd \\u2014 which raised just RM110 million in total. The performance of both counters have been poor, having declined over 30% since their listings, says Maimoonah. \\u00a0 This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on June 29 - July 5, 2015."}, "469": {"date_posted": "23/7/2015", "title": "PetChem to jointly build new plant with BASF", "article": " Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd\\u00a0\n(July 22, RM6.58)\nMaintain hold with higher fair value of RM6.20 per share from RM5.30 per share previously.

We are maintaining our earnings projection and target price at 41 sen based on 11 times price-earnings ratio (PER) on unchanged calendar year 2016 (CY16) earnings per share (EPS). Management shared that domestic oilfield revenue contribution will remain low due to lower rig counts and activities in Malaysia (total rig count of nine of which five are Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u2019s [Petronas]). Petronas\\u2019 contributions are expected to decline from 16% to average around 8% of company revenue. We expect to see the Middle East, Brazil and Argentina pick up in activities moving forward. Management aims to improve its gross profit margin from the current 24.4% to a range of 26% by adopting more stringent controls on its chemical and logistic costs. The outlook for the marine segment remains gloomy from the impact of low coal prices, hence affecting the volume of coal tonnage transport. As we understand, Petronas has asked SES to relook at its project costing. Management has resubmitted a new design plan and it is in the process of being reviewed by Petronas for approval. Management assures that at a lower oil price of US$55 (RM208.45) per barrel, Ophir RSC is still worthwhile to be given the green light based on the revised design plan. Ophir\\u2019s first oil timeline by the second half of 2016 remains unchanged. SES is looking at a few marginal field developments locally as well as India and Indonesia via partnerships. SES\\u2019 stock performance has been affected no thanks to a series of unfortunate events, from the tumble in oil prices as well as an adverse domestic and international economic environment. However, we view SES as a beneficiary of the stronger US dollar as 80% of its revenue is denominated in the currency. SES will also benefit from its wide range of new products and services offering via new acquisitions or joint ventures, hence further increasing its global market footprint. We are maintaining our financial year 2016 (FY16)/FY17 earnings projections at RM86.2 million and RM87.5 million as we prefer to remain conservative given the current ongoing sector headwinds for the year. We maintain our target price at 41 sen based on 11 times PER on unchanged CY16 EPS.

Protasco wants to forge ahead in the construction and property development sector, says Chong, putting an end to any question of whether the group is going to pursue diversification into the oil and gas sector. In January last year, the company announced the acquisition of a 63% stake in an Indonesian oil and gas company, PT Anglo Slavic Indonesia (ASI), for RM68.4 million from PT Anglo Slavic Utama (ASU). The deal was later aborted after the sale and purchase agreement lapsed. A boardroom tussle between Chong and Datuk Tey Por Yee, a substantial shareholder of Protasco, followed. Protasco alleged that Tey and his partner Ooi Kock Aun, who were both board members of the group from late-2012 to 2014, had breached their fiduciary and statutory duties. Chong alleged that Tey and Ooi held indirect interests in ASU. Protasco sued ASU to return the US$22 million it had paid for the purchase of the stake in ASI. Tey and Ooi later counter-sued Chong and Protasco, alleging that RM10 million had been siphoned off to Chong\\u2019s private vehicle. However, on June 3, Tey and Ooi\\u2019s counterclaim was struck out by the Kuala Lumpur High Court. The suit by Protasco is set for trial on Oct 1 and 2. Tey and Ooi have filed for a stay application pending arbitration. When asked about the lawsuits, Chong declines to dwell on them, saying that he\\u00a0 is leaving them to the courts to decide and just wants to focus on Protasco\\u2019s current businesses. He adds the squabble with Tey does not affect Protasco\\u2019s ability to secure jobs and deliver good earnings to shareholders. With its oil and gas aspirations snuffed out, Protasco can focus on growing its construction and property development business. However, it has only been getting government contracts and concessions so far. \\u00a0 The bulk of the group\\u2019s orders is made up of the RM578.5 million contract to build 1,680 apartments for civil servants in Putrajaya. Protasco bid for jobs for Petronas\\u2019 Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development project in Johor last year but did not manage to clinch any, reveals Chong. Protasco is arguably an expert in road construction and maintenance through its subsidiaries Roadcare (M) Sdn Bhd and HCM Engineering Sdn Bhd. Roadcare holds a 15-year concession to maintain federal roads in the states of Selangor, Pahang, Kelantan and Terengganu worth RM358 million. Meanwhile, HCM holds a 15-year concession to maintain Federal roads in Sibu, Bintulu and Mukah in Sarawak worth RM232 million. Roadcare and HCM\\u2019s concessions will expire in February 2016 and February 2018 respectively. Chong says Protasco is in negotiations to renew the Roadcare concession in Selangor. MIDF Research analyst Hafiz Hassan does not expect any problem there as the the same concession in the southern region has been renewed. \\u201cThat will guarantee the bulk of the group\\u2019s earnings visibility for the next 10 years,\\u201d says Hafiz in a research report dated May 28, 2015. The road maintenance business contributed about half of Protasco\\u2019s revenue of RM1.15 billion last year, and about 70% of its profit after tax of RM67 million. Besides the federal road maintenance concessions, Protasco also has long-term contracts to maintain state roads in Selangor, Terengganu and Perak. The Selangor contract will expire in September this year, followed by the Terengganu contract in July next year and the Perak job in December 2019. The contracts are valued at about RM240 million. Protasco is negotiating with the Selangor government to renew the contract, confirms Chong. However, Chong feels that Protasco should grow its construction business to give its shareholders double-digit earnings growth. \\u201cNevertheless, I am comfortable with the outstanding order book that we have right now, although we can always take in more. We can assure our shareholders an earnings growth of about 15% this year,\\u201d he says. In early April, the group secured from Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd a federal road construction contract worth RM77 million in Sarawak and a RM58 million contract to connect Jalan Klang Lama with the New Pantai Expressway. In the first quarter ended March 31, Protasco\\u2019s net profit grew 24% to RM13.1 million, compared with RM10.6 million in the same quarter last year. Revenue increased 48% to RM219.1 million from RM147.8 million.

In a management meet-up with SES, BIMB learnt the former was awaiting approval for a new design plan on the Ophir risk service contract\\u00a0 (RSC) from Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas), which asked it to re-look into their project costing. \\u201cThe management assured that at lower oil price level of US$55/barrel, Ophir RSC is still worthwhile to be given the green light, based on the revised design plan. Ophir\\u2019s first oil timeline by the second half of 2016, remains unchanged,\\u201d BIMB said in a company update note. According to SES, the domestic oilfield revenue contribution would remain low, due to lower rig counts and activities in Malaysia, where five out of nine rigs belong to Petronas. Contributions to SES from Petronas are expected to decline from 16% to average about 8% of company\\u2019s revenue, BIMB was told, adding it expects to see the Middle East, Brazil and Argentina pick up in activities, moving forward. SES (valuation: 0.5; fundamental: 1) was also looking at a few marginal field developments locally, and India and Indonesia via partnerships. \\u201cSES aims to improve its gross profit margin from the current 24.4% to a range of 26%, by adopting a more stringent control on its chemical and logistic costs. \\u201cThe outlook for the marine segment remains gloomy from the impact of low coal prices, hence affecting the volume of coal tonnage transport,\\u201d BIMB said. Despite the tumble in oil prices and adverse domestic and international economy, BIMB views SES as a beneficiary of a stronger dollar, because 80% of its revenue is USD-denominated. It stated SES would also benefit from the wide range of new products and services offering, through acquisitions or joint ventures that could increase its global market footprint. \\u201cWe are maintaining our financial year 2016 and 2017 earnings projection at RM86.2 million and RM87.5 million, as we prefer to remain conservative, given the current ongoing sector headwind faced for the year. \\u201cWe maintain our target price at 41 sen, based on 11x PER on unchanged CY16 EPS. Given that the current stock price has been dragged down by a series of misfortunes and present more than 10% upside, we upgrade SES to buy,\\u201d BIMB added. At 12.30pm, SES shares remained unchanged at 34 sen, giving it a market capitalisation of RM796.15 million.

There is no doubt that major infrastructure projects are in the pipeline, such as the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Line 2, Light Rail Transit (LRT) Line 3 and Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u2019s (Petronas) Rapid project. But, in his opinion, these jobs are not expected to be awarded soon. Nonetheless, Sim doesn\\u2019t seem to be overly worried. That\\u2019s because Kimlun is winning jobs across the causeway. The stronger Singapore dollar, which appreciated to RM2.7876 last Friday from RM2.6471 in early January, is working in Kimlun\\u2019s favour. \\u201cRight now, jobs in Singapore are more promising. They are smaller, but more consistent and less lumpy,\\u201d Sim tells The Edge. Kimlun is looking forward to securing some jobs from Singapore\\u2019s MRT line extension works, he says. These include packages for the MRT lines as well as electrical cable tunnelling jobs, he says, noting that Kimlun has been able to win jobs in the highly competitive market there. The Singaporean government is planning to double its rail length under its 2013 Land Transport Master Plan. The new 20km Jurong Region Line is expected to be completed by 2025, while the extension of the Circle Line, Downtown Line and the Northeast Line will add about 8km by 2030. On top of that is a proposed 50km cross-island line that is due by 2030. Most of these projects will have substantial underground sections that require the pre-fabricated concrete that Kimlun is manufacturing in Johor, where production costs are relatively lower than in the island republic. Sim notes that the weaker ringgit not only helps widen the profit margin of existing jobs, but also makes Kimlun more competitive in bidding for future packages in Singapore. The company isn\\u2019t overly-reliant on Malaysian mega projects to replenish its manufacturing order book. More than half of its pre-fabricated concrete product manufacturing order book is denominated in Singapore dollars \\u2014 about RM131 million worth \\u2014 for various infrastructure projects in the island state. Manufacturing orders at home amount to about RM135 million, according to Sim. Despite the gloomy outlook for corporate earnings, Kimlun managed to chalk up strong profit growth in the first financial quarter ended March 31. The Johor-based company\\u2019s core net profit ballooned 73% y-o-y to RM14.1 million in the quarter after stripping out a gain of RM15.4 million from disposals in the previous corresponding quarter. In the first quarter, Kimlun\\u2019s construction revenue rose 26.5%, driven by larger project billings. But more importantly, the division delivered better profit margins, up 0.4 percentage points to 6.7% mainly owing to its order book entering the mid-stage of construction, according to Kenanga Research. Kimlun is relatively well-positioned to weather the current slowdown. The group boasts an order book of RM1.33 billion \\u2014 RM1.1 billion for construction and RM230 million for manufacturing. On top of that, the property development arm is sitting on unbilled sales of RM73 million. While the total order book is substantially lower than the RM2.3 billion attained as at end-2013, Sim says it is enough to tide Kimlun over. In the meantime, he points out that the company\\u2019s factories for pre-fabricated concrete products are still \\u201cquite full\\u201d. The slowdown in new property launches may be dragging overall construction work but there is still strong demand for affordable housing projects \\u2014 the mainstay of Kimlun\\u2019s construction work. \\u201cWe expect to see a bit of a slowdown this year in terms of new orders, but it will pick up again in 2016,\\u201d Sim says. The group\\u2019s construction division is working with big property players such as IOI Properties Group Bhd, UEM Sunrise Bhd, United Malayan Land Bhd and Country View Bhd, on projects ranging from serviced and affordable apartments to factories and infrastructure works. In view of the slowdown, Sim says the group is placing emphasis on improving its profit margins this year. This will be aided by lower material costs, managing labour costs and taking on \\u201csimpler\\u201d affordable housing projects\\u201d. \\u201cThere are more jobs around the corner like the MRT line 2, LRT line 3 and Petronas\\u2019 Rapid project. But these are still some time off, and will not be awarded so soon,\\u201d he says. The three mega projects could be a big boost to the group\\u2019s manufacturing arm, which specialises in prefabricated concrete products, such as the segmental box girders used for the elevated viaducts in Line 1 of the Klang valley MRT that is under construction. \\u201cTheoretically, we should have an edge in the project since we already have the moulds from Line 1. However, that is assuming there isn\\u2019t too much variation in the design. Furthermore, the total cost of the moulds isn\\u2019t that high. Depending on the size and volume of the orders, the moulds make up less than 5% of cost. In fact, it is less than 3% to 4%,\\u201d Sim, explains. He expects the size of the orders from Line 2 to be smaller. Kimlun\\u2019s share price has been hovering at the RM1.20 to RM1.35 level so far this year. The stock tumbled from its peak of RM2.10 in June 2013 to RM1.30 last Friday despite a steady growth in profit over the past four quarters. Kenanga has an \\u201coutperform\\u201d call on Kimlun with a target price of RM1.66, based on a price earnings ratio of 10 times and a net profit estimate of RM46.2 million and RM49.9 million in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Kenanga\\u2019s optimistic view stems from the expectation that there will be more affordable housing jobs in the Southern region. However, AmResearch remains cautious, citing a \\u201cmacro slowdown in Johor\\u201d. \\u201cWe maintain \\u2018hold\\u2019 on Kimlun with an unchanged sum-of-parts based fair value of RM1.38 per share. This implies a target PE of 13 times FY15 forecast earnings,\\u201d the research house said in its report. \\u00a0 This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on June 15 - 21, 2015. \\u00a0"}, "480": {"date_posted": "6/7/2015", "title": "Jaks, OSK Holdings, MMC Corp, Pentamaster, Public Bank and Oriented Media", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (July 6): Based on corporate announcements and news flow today, the companies that may be in focus tomorrow (Tuesday, July 7) could be the following: Jaks, OSK Holdings, MMC Corp, Pentamaster, Public Bank and Oriented Media.

Regus Management (M) Sdn Bhd (Regus Malaysia) opened a business centre in Johor Baru City Square office tower in April this year. \\u201cWe are targeting the manufacturing, logistics, biodiesel business and other project-based business,\\u201d Regus Malaysia country manager Vijayakumar Tangarasan told The Edge Financial Daily in a recent interview. Measuring about 8,000 sq ft, he expects demand to come from multinational companies (MNCs), small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups. \\u00a0 Vijayakumar said business activities have started to pick up in Johor, which is also seeing an improvement in its infrastructure. He noted that there is massive development in the state, not only in Iskandar Malaysia, but also Senai, Skudai and Pasir Gudang. \\u201cWe did not see a slowdown in Iskandar Malaysia last year, but we expect investments to pick up due to the tax relief and other benefits provided,\\u201d he explained. Despite the glut and overdevelopment in Iskandar Malaysia, the robust activities in Johor are \\u00a0expected to provide opportunities for local SMEs and MNCs. Vijayakumar sees Johor being developed into a logistics hub over the next three years and Petroliam Nasional Bhd's (Petronas) Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development project in Pengerang boosting demand for serviced offices. Regus provides more flexibility to its clients in terms of the tenure and the rental space, enabling cost savings for businesses. Its other services include virtual office (VO) and business lounge membership. VO provides it clients a business address in the right place, a local contact number answered in their company name, and a team that manages calls and handles mails. Regus' Businessworld exclusive membership scheme allows its clients to access its business lounges across its network. Describing it as the \\u201cright time\\u201d for Regus to expand into Johor, Vijayakumar said some of the project-based companies do not look for conventional office space, but smaller and more flexible workspace like what Regus has got to offer. He also pointed out Johor\\u2019s proximity to Singapore has played a role to increase demand for serviced offices in the state where rental costs and labour costs are comparatively lower. \\u201cWe are going into Iskandar Malaysia in a year\\u2019s time. The demand is already there,\\u201d he added. Regus Malaysia is also looking to expand into Pasir Gudang, Skudai and Tampoi. Apart from Johor, Vijayakumar said Regus Malaysia is also eyeing places like Melaka and Ipoh. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have a target, but will continuously grow,\\u201d he said, adding that Regus Malaysia has been growing aggressively in recent years and it has expanded from six business centres in 2012 to 23 now.\\u00a0 Currently, Regus Malaysia occupies 24,000 sq ft of office space across the Klang Valley, Penang, Kota Kinabalu, Labuan and Johor, and the overall occupancy rate is at 80%. Most of its business centres are located in the Klang Valley. He said most of the company\\u2019s clients are from the oil and gas and informtion technology industries. Its products are also popular among project-based engineers, legal firms and start-ups. He added that 60% of its clients are locals, while 40% are MNCs. Commenting on the oversupply of office space in the Klang Valley, Vijayakumar noted that property developers are adding more offices to the market even though the occupancy rate is about 82%. \\u00a0 \\u00a0 He explained that as the company is providing small spaces, the impact is less on its business, adding that most of the rooms Regus provides are mostly for three to four people. \\u00a0 On competition, Vijayakumar said price war does happen as there are similar providers locally. \\u201cCompetitors are not there yet, not at this (Regus') scale.

Little known Kelington Group Bhd, for one, said it sees opportunities amid the current low price environment. Two years into its O&G venture, things are getting exciting for Kelington (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 1.4). On June 3, it inked a collaboration agreement with Petro Allied International DMCEST (PAI), which will pave the way for it to access the world\\u2019s largest crude oil production hub. Its joint venture (JV) with PAI, a company incorporated in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, will allow it to bid for Middle East O&G jobs. \\u201cDespite the weakening of crude oil prices, the Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (Opec) have no plans to reduce their production. Activities did not slow down and opportunities are still available,\\u201d said Kelington chief executive officer (CEO) Raymond Gan. Last November, the powerful oil cartel Opec said it had no intention of cutting production levels to stem the collapse in oil prices. At that time, oil prices had fallen by about a third from a high of US$115 a barrel three months earlier. Analysts have estimated that global oil prices will stay below US$80 (RM303) per barrel in 2015. A relative newbie in the industry, Kelington, which aims to become one of the major engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC) contractors globally, has been busy building up its track record in the last two years. It has so far managed to bag two contracts amounting to RM22 million from BASF Petronas Chemicals Sdn Bhd and Petron Refinery Malaysia Bhd in Port Dickson, Negeri Sembilan.\\u00a0 Despite being a relatively new player, Kelington believes it has an advantage over more established rivals in that it can offer competitive bids. \\u201cThe decline in oil price has prompted all O&G firms to cut their expenses. As a new player, we can offer a more competitive bid. When there is a downturn, the owners are more likely to [keep a closer watch on] cost, and they are more willing to consider new players,\\u201d he explained. Gan said the company\\u2019s focus will be on the downstream side of the industry, such as jobs to build oil tanks and piping works.\\u00a0 The new venture with PAI will take time to yield results. Gan said it was unlikely that the venture would be able to secure any material projects this year as it would need time to prepare for future work. He expects the group\\u2019s revenue growth to stay flat this year. \\u201cBased on the current order book we have, we are of the view that revenue for the current financial year ending Decr 31 2015 (FY15) will be comparable with FY14,\\u201d he said. In FY14, the group registered a net profit of RM5.18 million on the back of revenue of RM189.66 million. As at May 31, 2015, Kelington\\u2019s order book stood at RM250 million, with RM197 million outstanding. With this, the group expects to be kept busy for the next 12 to 15 months. The group is also tendering for some RM640 million worth of projects. For its first quarter ended March 31, 2015, Kelington\\u2019s net profit was flat at RM2.08 million despite revenue falling by 27.42% to RM38.52 million from the same quarter a year ago. On its RM148 million healthcare project from International Healthway Corp (IHC) in China, which has been put on hold, Gan said that the owner of the project has yet to get the licence from the authorities. The project was temporarily put on hold in the second half of 2014 pending the authorities\\u2019 approval for the change of layout design, from a maternity centre to a full-fledged hospital.\\u00a0 \\u201cWe are not too sure when they are going to do that (get the licence). But we are actively talking to them and there is a possibility to break the contract or keep it hanging there,\\u201d he said. He said there is also the possibility that the owner may give up on the project. \\u201cIf so, then we may have to take out this project, about RM100 million in value, from our order book,\\u201d he remarked. If that were to happen, he doesn\\u2019t think it will have a significant impact on Kelington. \\u201cWe would still have a RM150 million order book that could support the company\\u2019s earnings,\\u201d he explained. Over the past one year, trading in Kelington shares has been very volatile. From a high of 47.5 sen on Oct 3 last year, the stock dipped to a low of 30.5 sen on Dec 16 in the same year.\\u00a0 The stock has, however, recovered somewhat over this year. It closed unchanged at 38 sen last Friday, with some 20,000 shares changing hands, with a market capitalisation of RM83.17 million.

It isn\\u2019t a pretty picture and it is time for a reality check. Last Friday, Malaysia reported an 8.8% contraction in exports in April \\u2013 a fall that was worse than consensus forecast of minus 5.5%. Commodity exports continued to drive down export growth, led by LNG (down 40%), refined petroleum products (down 37%) and crude palm oil (down 20%). Chua Hak Bin, Asean economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, opines that falling LNG prices will worsen Malaysia\\u2019s export slowdown, hurting economic growth and external balances. Electrical and electronics (E&E), which helped sustain export growth in the last six months, fell 3%. \\u201cThe latest reading and recent job cuts at electronics firms suggest that this engine of growth may be faltering,\\u201d says Chua. The export contraction comes after a 2.3% expansion in March. Economists generally view the positive performance in March as a technical rebound from February\\u2019s sharp fall of 9.7%. Going forward, economists aren\\u2019t expecting a turnaround. This is because they see continued subdued demand from major markets like China, Singapore and Japan. \\u201cThe April numbers are a better reflection of underlying global demand, which thus far has not been as strong as expected,\\u201d says DBS Research in a report. Private investment isn\\u2019t doing too well either. Total investments in the manufacturing sector may have risen 152% to RM33.7 billion in the first quarter of this year but the bulk of it, RM25.4 billion, was accounted for by Petronas\\u2019 investment in the Pengerang project. Indeed, stripping out this lumpy item, the investment number tells a more worrisome trend. Total investments in the period would have fallen 51.5% \\u2014 a continued downtrend from the 50.9% plunge in the fourth quarter of last year. Domestic investments showed a spectacular 595% turnaround to RM27.7 billion in the first quarter from a drop of 49.2% in 4Q2015. However, without Petronas\\u2019 contribution, the number would have shown a sharp fall of 42.5%. Meanwhile, foreign direct investments (FDIs) registered a sharper fall of 55% to just RM5.9 billion in the first quarter compared with 4Q2015\\u2019s drop of 52.2% to RM4.6 billion. Most economists are of the view that private investment isn\\u2019t likely to show improvement anytime soon. In fact, increasingly, the view is that the trend will likely continue to worsen, as confidence and sentiment in the country have been shaken by the current uncertain political climate and the 1MDB debacle. \\u201cBusiness owners are likely to want to take a wait-and-see stance before putting in more investments in their operations or to expand, pending further developments in the political scene and clarity on how 1MDB will unfold,\\u201d says an industry observer. The situation is compounded by the discovery of 139 graves in multiple human trafficking camps in the Malaysian jungles. Malaysia is already on the US\\u2019 human trafficking blacklist, and this could impact trade and investment flows into Malaysia from the US in the months ahead. Incidentally, the US was Malaysia\\u2019s top foreign investor in the first quarter of this year, accounting for 36.3% of total approved FDIs. Consensus forecast on private investment growth in 2015 is around 8%, down from 11% recorded in 2014. It must be noted here that private investment is a key driver in Malaysia\\u2019s Economic Transformation Programme (ETP), launched in 2010. For some years now, Malaysia\\u2019s growth has been driven by strong consumer spending. A setback, though, is in the offing as Malaysians generally have begun to cut back on their spending, due mainly to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), tougher guidelines on bank lending to curb household debt, an anaemic stock market performance (erosion of wealth) and a weakening ringgit. Already, the signs are there. A dipstick poll of some retail, restaurant and hotel operators showed that business has shown a sharp drop since the implementation of GST on April 1. The fall is partly because consumers had gone on a buying spree pre-GST. Economists see a consumer spending slowdown in the next few months, with a clearer picture emerging towards the end of the year as spending patterns normalise. But the general trend is downwards. BofAML\\u2019s Chua, for example, says: \\u201cWe are expecting the lower energy prices and GST to hurt investment, exports and consumer spending.\\u201d Sentiment took a further beating from a falling stock market and weakening ringgit. While regional markets have all fallen in recent weeks on concern of a rise in US interest rates, Bursa Malaysia is turning out to be the worst performer. In May, Bursa Malaysia fell 3.9%, due largely to foreign selling. BIMB Securities Research notes that the total net foreign outflow from the equity market in May was RM2.5 billion, the highest for the year. Year-to-date outflow was RM5.8 billion, compared with a total outflow of RM6.9 billion in 2014. Comparatively, in May, Singapore fell 2.73%, the Philippines 1.74%, Jakarta was up 2.55%, and Thailand was down 2.01%. Going forward, market observers see further downside bias, not least because of a deterioration in corporate earnings. Earnings reported in the first quarter of this year were generally down, and corporate earnings growth has been revised downwards since then to around 6%, from 6.7% before. \\u201cWe suspect the selldown may not be entirely due to market fundamentals but instead attributed to prevailing political undercurrents coupled with an imminent re-rating by Fitch in June,\\u201d BIMB Securities says. Second Finance Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Husni Hanadzlah warned last week that failure to resolve the 1MDB issue could have knock-on effects on the government\\u2019s fiscal balance as well as the ringgit. Again, while the region\\u2019s currencies have weakened in recent weeks, the ringgit is one of the worst performers. Thus far in June, the local currency has depreciated by 1.37%, after falling 2.8% in May. Last Friday, the currency revisited March lows, trading around the RM3.72 level against the US dollar and reached a new all-time low of RM2.762 against the Singapore dollar. It traded around RM5.69 against the British pound and RM4.19 vis-a-vis the euro. Prospects ahead aren\\u2019t looking good either, weighed down by expectations of a significant slowdown in economic growth in the next few quarters, the political uncertainty and the ongoing 1MDB debacle which has hurt investor sentiment. Some economists are projecting lower 2015 gross domestic product (GDP) at between 4.3% and 4.6%, compared with 6% in 2014. GDP growth in the first quarter came in at 5.6%, supported by stronger private investment and consumer spending ahead of GST implementation. Given expectations of a significant reduction in growth in the months ahead, a view is that Bank Negara Malaysia could go for a rate cut in the later part of the year to support the economy. Already, many Asian central banks have cut interest rates since the beginning of this year, including India, Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand and China. Bank Negara has room to cut rates as inflation is still under control. Expectations are the central bank will reduce the overnight policy rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 3% by the end of the year. \\u00a0 This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on June 8 -14, 2015."}, "485": {"date_posted": "26/6/2015", "title": "The Edge Billion Ringgit Club: Meet the CEO: Petronas Dagangan proves resilient to oil price slump", "article": " PETRONAS DAGANGAN BHD, the domestic marketing arm of Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas), has proved its resilience despite the slump in oil prices. The sharp fall in prices taught the company a valuable lesson, Petronas Dagangan CEO and managing director Mohd Ibrahimnuddin Mohd Yunus says during The Edge Billion Ringgit Club \\u201cMeet the CEO\\u201d session last Friday, which drew a full house. \\u201c[In response,] we brought down our operating cost by 30%, especially transport and entertainment expenses,\\u201d he tells students at KDU Glenmarie Campus. Ibrahimnuddin notes that oil prices tumbled 45% to a five-year low of US$50 a barrel in January this year, which shocked not only Petronas Dagangan (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 1.1) but also the whole world. \\u201cThis had an adverse effect on our margins,\\u201d he says, adding that most of Petronas Dagangan\\u2019s margins come from the retailing business. He acknowledges that it was a difficult time. \\u201cWhen that happened, we lost a lot of money. Normally, we register profits of between RM150 million and RM200 million every quarter. For the fourth quarter of last year, we were really lucky to just make money (some profits).\\u201d In the fourth quarter ended Dec 31 last year, Petronas Dagangan\\u2019s net profit plunged to RM445,000, a decline of 99.7% year on year. Revenue was 11.13% lower at RM7.45 billion. Earnings per share fell to 0.04 sen from 15.20 sen the previous year. The deterioration in its 4QFY2014 results came on the back of a decrease in sales volume and average selling price, the company said in an announcement dated Feb 12 this year. However, in the first quarter ended March 31 this year, Petronas Dagangan staged a firm rebound, registering a net profit of RM205.77 million against RM155.08 million in the pre\\u00advious corresponding period. Revenue, meanwhile, dipped 26.43% y-o-y to RM6.1 billion. The resurgence of profit was mainly due to lower operating expenditure and higher other income by RM19.9 million, according to an announcement dated May 11. In the event of another oil shock in the future, Ibrahimnuddin, 51, says Petronas Dagangan will be able to face it as \\u201cwe have put in a lot of strategies to address these issues\\u201d. Before embarking on his journey as Petronas Dagangan chief in February last year, Ibrahimnuddin had served in Petronas for 26 years. He also did a stint in Bank Negara Malaysia after graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from York University in Canada. Responding to a question on how he overcame the challenges during his tenure with Petronas, Ibrahimnuddin says, \\u201cIn my journey to become a CEO, I failed many times but I did not give up.\\u201d His advice to the students is, \\u201cYou will fail and there\\u2019s no rosy path to success, but don\\u2019t give up. There\\u2019s always room for improvement to make everyone better.\\u201d He reminisces about the time when Petronas started off in a small office in the 1980s. \\u201cWe have progressed so much \\u2026 After the oil crisis in the 1970s, we had to become a domestic player to ensure ample supply to the market.\\u201d At the moment, Petronas\\u2019 operations span over 50 countries in every continent. \\u201cWe are ranked 69 in terms of revenue in the Fortune Global 500 ranking. We are number two in terms of production in the world.\\u201d Petronas produces about two million barrels of oil per day, he says. \\u201cWe are in surplus, [and therefore we] export our oil.\\u201d Ibrahimnuddin says Petronas\\u2019 RM60 billion Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development project is in progress. \\u201cJohor is going to be where the action is.\\u201d Petronas Dagangan has four core businesses, namely retail (products sold in petrol stations), commercial (supply of diesel, jet fuel and so on), liquefied petroleum gas and lubricants. It owns more than 1,000 petrol stations nationwide. It also has the biggest network in Malaysia with 750 Petronas Kedai Mesra, which is its one-stop convenience centre. On top of that, Petronas provides retail offerings such as Starbucks, Dunkin\\u2019 Donuts and KFC in some of its petrol stations. \\u201cWe feel that it\\u2019s a win-win partnership between all these outlets and us at our retail stations. \\u201cWhen our customers come and fill up petrol, they can enjoy Starbucks and Dunkin\\u2019 Donuts or any other quick-service restaurants at the same time.

The four pillars involve focusing on the offshore support vessel (OSV) market, the brownfield O&G segment, maintenance and its wholly-owned subsidiary Gas Generators (M) Sdn Bhd (GasTec). \\u201cMuch [profit turnaround] still depends on the overall market situation such as a pick up in the O&G sector and whether we can weather the storm. But I think the situation will be better by early next year,\\u201d Tanjung Offshore group chief executive officer Rahman Shamsudin told reporters after the group\\u2019s annual general meeting yesterday. \\u201cWe will let the authorities investigate all the old issues (previous controversial deals). Our focus now is to turn around the company,\\u201d he said. Tanjung Offshore executive deputy chairman Tan Sri Tan Kean Soon said the group is looking at several brownfield projects both locally and aboard to add to its RM500 million order book. \\u201cWe are keeping a close eye on new O&G discoveries in Malaysia, particularly Sarawak, Sabah and Terengganu,\\u201d he said. It is also looking for opportunities in Indonesia, Vietnam and Myanmar. \\u201cWe have the right mix of services to grow with these new discoveries in undertaking onshore and offshore projects,\\u201d said Tan. The group plans to inject some RM100 million in capital expenditure (capex) over the next few years for its brownfield segment activity. In addition, Tanjung Offshore will strengthen its maintenance and services division by forming partnerships with international O&G players to undertake maintenance and services projects at the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (Rapid) project in Pengerang, Johor. \\u201cWe are in talks with major contractors from South Korea and Japan on possible joint venture opportunities,\\u201d said Tan, but nothing has been confirmed yet. Despite noting that the O&G sector has been slowing down on the capex side, Tan said O&G firms did not cut down their operating expenditure (opex). \\u201cThey still need to spend on the maintenance of their safety equipment at their platforms. There is no way for them to compromise on this. We are eyeing these kinds of jobs,\\u201d he said. \\u201cMost of our Petronas\\u2019 (Petroliam Nasional Bhd) assets out there are quite old assets and they need maintenance. As such, we are on the right track and in good position on this,\\u201d he said. Additionally, Tanjung Offshore will re-enter the OSV market following the expiry of the three-year \\u201cnon-compete clause\\u201d. Tanjung Offshore had sold off its OSV arm Tanjung Kapal Services Sdn Bhd to Equiti Nasional Bhd in 2012. \\u201cIt (the non-compete clause) will lapse in mid-July this year,\\u201d said Rahman. \\u201cOSV (business) can be one of the group\\u2019s revenue contributions provided charter rates are favourable,\\u201d he said. \\u201cTanjung Offshore\\u2019s business activities are not heavily contingent on oil prices and the group is seeking out technologies that would enable lower operational costs,\\u201d he said. On its subsidiary GasTec, Rahman said the group will look to expand into the mechanical and engineering segment. For the first quarter ended March 31, 2015, Tanjung Offshore fell into the red, registering a net loss of RM1.97 million against a net profit of RM2.1 million a year ago. On its eight-storey office building in Birmingham, the United Kingdom, Rahman said the group has yet to decide whether to sell or retain it for recurring income. \\u201cDisposal could be one of the options. We can either dispose or add yield to it (the property) by undertaking a refurbishment of the property. But the question is what kind of refurbishment, be it a residential, a hostel or other form,\\u201d he said. Rahman said the final decision will depend on the outcome of the investigations. Over the past one year, the trading of Tanjung Offshore shares has been very volatile. Its share price was traded at a high of 61 sen on July 9 last year and plunged to a low of 30 sen on Dec 17 in the same year. Since then, the stock has slowly recovered and closed two sen or 4.08% at 47 sen yesterday, for a market capitalisation of RM185.74 million.

We maintain our forecasts, which have already assumed revenue of RM120 million and RM150 million for forecast financial year 2015 (FY15F) and FY16F respectively for the transport and installation and underwater services divisions. Based on a pre-tax margin assumption of 15%, we estimate that this project could generate earnings of approximately RM2 million for FY15F for Alam. Alam would most likely utilise its 300-man pipelay accommodation workbarge, 1Mas- 300, for this project which involves four to five pipelines at the terminal. We are positive on this news, given that this is the second installation job secured by the group this month amid a slow capital expenditure cycle, which would offset the muted performance of its offshore support vessel segment. The group\\u2019s order book stands at approximately RM900 million, and it is bidding for RM2.5 billion to RM3 billion worth of projects.

In a filing to Bursa, Destini (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 0.8) said it had entered into a heads of agreement (HoA) for the proposed acquisition of Destination Marine Services Sdn Bhd (DMS) with Ultrasama Marine Sdn Bhd, Goldleaf Pavilion Sdn Bhd and Radzuan Idris (the vendors) today. It said the consideration for the proposed acquisition may be satisfied via a combination of new shares and/or cash. DMS manufactures paramilitary boats and various types and sizes of vessels and its track record spans over four decades, besides providing ship repair and marine-related engineering services. Destini said DMS was recently awarded with a three-year contract by the Malaysia Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA), valued at RM381.3 million, to build 6 units of patrol boats.

On whether Muhibbah fears any payment delay by Petronas, Ngan Boon said this is part of the risk in the construction sector, but added he did not see Petronas to unreasonably delay its payment. Apart from focusing on its four key divisions (construction and engineering, crane, shipyard and airport concession), Ngan Boon did not dismiss the possibility of the company diversifying into other \"interesting\" businesses.

It is learnt that the two have put in \\u201cthe best bids thus far, and are favourites to bag the large-scale job\\u201d, a source says. Some of the bidders contacted by The Edge were also aware of WCT-Arabtec and UEM-Samsung leading the pack for the job, which is likely to be awarded by Permodalan Nasional Bhd in the next few months. The two front runners are among six shortlisted bidders. The other four are a tripartite joint venture between IJM Corp Bhd (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 1.4), Norwest Holdings Sdn Bhd and Shimizu Corp; a collaboration between Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB) (fundamental: 0.6; valuation: 0.8) and China State Construction Engineering Corp; a partnership between TSR Capital Bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.2) and Daewoo Group; and a bid by Seacera Group Bhd (fundamental: 1.6; valuation: 3.0), which is partnering its 60% unit Spaz Sdn Bhd and China\\u2019s Sinohydro Corp-Shanghai Construction Group. A UEM official says, \\u201cUEM\\u2019s subsidiary UEM Builders Bhd has submitted a bid for the project,\\u201d but did not elaborate. UEM is a wholly-owned unit of state controlled Khazanah Nasional Bhd, which would indicate that it has deep pockets. UEM\\u2019s partner, Samsung, has participated in the building of many of the world\\u2019s skyscrapers including the 452m Petronas Twin Towers, which was the tallest structure in the world at the time of its completion. In 2010, Samsung delivered the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which is currently the tallest building in the world at 828m and 163 storeys high. Meanwhile, WCT has a strong partner in Arabtec. Arabtec, Samsung and Belgium\\u2019s Besix were the key players that built the Burj Khalifa. Officials of WCT could not be reached for comment. According to its 2014 annual report, as at end-March this year, WCT Capital Sdn Bhd \\u2014 the vehicle of managing director Taing Kim Hwa and Wong Sewe Wing \\u2014 was the largest shareholder with 19.5% equity interest in the construction company. Other substantial shareholders include pilgrim fund Lembaga Tabung Haji with 10.2%, the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) with 9.1%, Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) with 7.5% and AmanahRaya Trustees with 7.2%. For the financial year ended Dec 31, 2014, WCT posted a net profit of RM120.5 million from almost RM1.7 billion in revenue. As at end-December last year, WCT had cash and bank balances of RM950.8 million, long-term debt commitments of RM1.8 billion and short-term borrowings of RM584.1 million. While UEM-Samsung and WCT-Arabtec are the front runners, industry sources do not discount the likes of MRCB nicking the job. \\u201cYes they are the front runners, but it\\u2019s not like all hope is gone \\u2026 we are still hopeful. We have our strengths as well,\\u201d one of the other bidders says. Some of the bids, it seems, were not competitive. Others were said to have dropped out. One source says that IJM and its partners have pulled out of the race, but this remains unverified. IJM managing director Datuk Soam Heng Choon could not be contacted, while some of the other senior officials were abroad. IJM\\u2019s partners in the bid are Shimizu, a large Japanese construction company, and local firm Norwest. IJM had previously worked with Shimizu, together with UEM and Nishimatsu Construction, on the RM2 billion tunnelling portion of the Pahang-Selangor interstate water transfer project a few years ago. Norwest is the vehicle of Aziz Bahaman, who has links to IJM \\u2014 he was a director of Industrial Concrete Products Bhd, a unit of IJM. While MRCB and China State Construction Engineering are not the front runners, sources say they cannot be written off. \\u201cMRCB has built quite a few buildings \\u2014 it does have the experience. And its partner [China State Construction Engineering] is a US$45 billion company \\u2026 so they cannot be taken lightly,\\u201d one source says. It is also noteworthy that MRCB is 38.4% controlled by the EPF. For the year ended December 2014, MRCB reported RM152.6 million in net profit from RM1.5 billion in revenue. As at the end of last year, MRCB had deposits, cash and bank balances of RM660.7 million. During the period under review, the company had short-term borrowings of close to RM1.4 billion and long-term debt commitments of RM1.2 billion. TSR Capital, at its close of 84 sen last Thursday, had a market capitalisation of RM97.7 million. For the financial year ended December 2014, it posted a net profit of RM2.5 million from RM107 million in revenue. Nevertheless, TSR\\u2019s partner \\u2014 South Korea\\u2019s Daewoo Group \\u2014 is one of the largest conglomerates in Asia. Daewoo Engineering & Construction Co Ltd has a market capitalisation of almost US$3 billion. Seacera, at its close of 79 sen last Thursday, had a market capitalisation of RM143.3 million. Seacera\\u2019s partner and 60% unit, Spaz, is also relatively small, but the strength of its bid comes from its Chinese partner, Sinohydro Corp-Shanghai Construction Group. Seacera last October concluded the acquisition of 60% of Spaz for RM3 million. The other 40% is held by Mohd Azami Idris via his vehicle Actual Capital Sdn Bhd. Spaz posted after tax profits of RM72,660 from RM36.9 million in revenue for the financial year ended December 2014. It is noteworthy that Seacera\\u2019s partnership with the Chinese party was sealed in May last year in Beijing, during premier Datuk Seri Najib Razak\\u2019s visit to China. Nevertheless, for the smaller companies, the payment of the performance bond \\u2014 amounting to 5% of the construction cost \\u2014 could be problematic. If the construction portion is RM3 billion, as stated in news reports, the performance bond could amount to RM150 million, which may deter some of the smaller companies.

On KKB (fundamental: 1.95; valuation: 1.4), Soon said AmResearch had an FV of RM2.05 for the stock. Sarawak Cable is put in good stead to secure jobs from construction of dams, thanks to its position as the leading domestic integrated electricity transmission player. \\u201dSome near-term prospects for Sarawak Cable include: (i) TNB\\u2019s (Tenaga Nasional Bhd's) tenders for cable supply for distribution lines amounting to ~RM1.2 billion; (ii) underground cables for 132kV lines in Petra Jaya; and (iii) TNB\\u2019s 500kV overhead transmission lines.\\u201d Meanwhile, HSL is said to be a strong contender for work packages of the Pan Borneo Highway, given its expertise in land reclamation jobs. \\u201cHSL is also tipped to secure the second phase of the Kuching central sewerage system, which will be worth at least ~RM500 million. It had in 1Q15 completed the first phase, which was worth RM452 million,\\u201d Soon said. KKB will benefit from government expenditure in rural development. Soon said this would involve steel pipe supply for water projects there. But analysts have also noted KKB's oil and gas (O&G) related ventures, which are deemed crucial earnings growth factors for the company. \\u201cKKB\\u2019s earnings profile is anticipated to change significantly, given its foray into O&G support services via 42%-owned associate and Petronas-licensed services provider Oceanmight Sdn Bhd,\\u201d Soon said.

Sunway Iskandar Bhd (SISB), an indirect subsidiary of Sunway Bhd (fundamental:1.5; valuation: 2.4), is partnering with Daiwa House Malaysia Sdn Bhd (Daiwa) to construct 100 pre-fabricated homes in Iskandar, Johor, a project which carries an estimated gross development value of RM210 million. In a filing with Bursa, Sunway said SISB has entered into a subscription and shareholders agreement today with Daiwa and the JVCo \\u2013 Daiwa Sunway Development Sdn Bhd \\u2013 with the intention of establishing the joint venture via the JVCo. Under the SSA, Daiwa will hold 70% of the JVCo, while SISB will own the remaining 30%. On the same date, SISB had also entered into a lease purchase agreement (LPA) with the JVCo for the disposal and lease transfer of a piece of 13.02 acre land in Iskandar, Johor, for RM63.07 million. The proposed development will use prefabricated technologies to build 100 landed properties comprising bungalows, semi-detached, and cluster homes in a gated and guarded community, with its own facilities. Lysaght Galvanised Steel Bhd announced today that its board of directors have rejected nomination notices for the election as directors that were submitted by two shareholders ahead of its annual general meeting (AGM) on June 22. In an announcement with Bursa, Lysaght (fundamental: 1.95; valuation: 2.4) said the board had received the notices of nomination from the two shareholders on June 9 and June 10, and after deliberating them at a special board meeting yesterday (June 10), decided to reject them. \\u201cThe board wishes to announce that following the deliberation and taking into consideration a legal opinion which has expressed that the notices submitted by the two shareholders were not valid, the board has rejected the said two notices,\\u201d the filing read. \\u201cAccordingly, the persons being nominated in the notices will not be eligible for election as directors and their nominations will not be tabled at the forthcoming AGM,\\u201d it added. Lysaght said the board's decision was arrived at, after a vote with three directors voting in favour, two directors against, and two directors abstaining. The Edge Weekly had reported Lysaght managing director Liew Hoi Foo and his sister-in-law Annie Chew Meu Jong are currently in a tussle over leadership of the company, one that was precipitated by the passing of Lysaght founder Chew Kar Heing in February last year. The feud reportedly began when Meu Jong objected to Lysaght\\u2019s proposal, which was mooted by Liew last year, for a share split, bonus issue and free warrants. The proposal was aborted in October last year. Meu Jong is the oldest daughter of Kar Heing and an Australian citizen who sits on the board as non-executive director. The weekly also reported that Liew\\u2019s position hangs in the balance until the AGM, as shareholders decide on his re-election. Sunsuria Bhd is targeting to enjoy RM1 billion property sales per year, moving forward. Its executive director Kong Wai Seng said the group is targetting to record sales of about RM900 million for the current financial year ending Sept 30, 2016 (FY16). The property developer has changed its financial year-end from March to September. Kong said the total launches of the group would be worth about RM1 billion in the next 12 months. He said the bulk of the launches will be coming from the group's township development around the Xiamen University Malaysia campus in Bandar Kota Warisan, Sepang, Selangor, which measures 331.27 acres, with a gross development value (GDV) of RM6.4 billion.

In a strongly worded statement, MISIF president Datuk Soh Thian Lai said the federation was \\u201cutterly disappointed\\u201d and \\u201cdeeply concerned\\u201d with the natural gas price increase as not only is it being imposed in an inopportune time but also is not justifiable as energy prices are low. \\u201cGas Malaysia, a monopoly supplier of natural gas to the industrial users in the country, has recorded sterling profit results of above RM160 million continuously for the past three financial years (2012 to 2014),\\u201d he said. \\u201cWith such excellent earnings, we view the recent price increase as not only unjustified but also smacked of excessive profiteering. \\u201cTherefore, we strongly oppose to this price increase of natural gas by Gas Malaysia and we urgently request the government to undertake immediate measures to prevent the intended price increase from taking effect,\\u201d he added. On Tuesday, Gas Malaysia (fundamental: 2.1; valuation: 1.1) announced that the government will increase natural gas tariff for the non-power sector by 10.27% to RM21.80 per one million British thermal units (mmbtu) from RM19.77 per mmbtu previously effective July 1. This is despite an announcement made by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak while unveiling the revised national Budget 2015 on January 15 this year that the scheduled gas price hike for the industrial sector will be postponed amid falling crude oil prices. Gas Malaysia has said in its announcement in Bursa Malaysia that the hike is to take into account the increase in the purchase price of gas that Gas Malaysia procures from Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas). The Edge Financial Daily reported today that Gas Malaysia\\u2019s profit margins are likely to improve due to the hike, projecting an increase between 25% and 38% in the group\\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) over the following three years. Soh said there is justifiable reason for the increase in the gas price as the international natural gas price is currently traded at only US$2.84 per mmbtu (RM10.70 per mmbtu) at the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex). Moreover, the NYMEX natural gas price was US$4.53 per mmbtu one year ago, a drop of 37.3% year-on-year as compared to Gas Malaysia\\u2019s tariff, which increased from average tariff of RM19.32 per mmbtu to RM21.80 per mmbtu, an increase of 12.8%, he added. \\u201cThis clearly shows that the domestic natural gas pricing is moving against the world trend,\\u201d he added. Soh said the steel industry is an energy intensive industry that consumes between 5 mmbtu and 7 mmbtu of natural gas for each metric tonne of steel making or rolling activity and the increase in natural gas price will adversely affect competitiveness in the international markets and would severely jeopardise exports of steel products. The increase in natural gas tariff translates to an average of 3% to 4% increase in the total production cost, resulting in additional cost of about RM100 million per year to the steel industry, he added. \\u201cThe industry would have difficulties in passing the increase in costs to end-users as the latter might opt to import to maintain their competitiveness,\\u201d he said. This is crucial as the industry is already facing fierce competition from imported steel products from all over the world, especially China, and there has been severe influx of imported iron and steel materials into the country, Soh said. He said the increase in imports of iron and steel products continues to haunt the industry, whereby imports have increased nearly 50% from 5.17 million tonnes in 2011 to 7.73 million tonnes last year. \\u00a0 The iron and steel industry is one of the manufacturing industries that had to bear the brunt of higher fuel costs since the previous hike on October 29 last year, whereby the natural gas tariff for the non-power sector was raised by around 2% on the back of the government\\u2019s tariff revision. Soh had previously said the hike was done during a bad time, marked by falling oil prices, low steel prices coupled with the goods and services tax. Gas Malaysia shares are currently trading unchanged at RM2.80, with 13,500 shares done.

Piarapakaran noted today that this development was contrary to the expectation that Malaysia would enjoy cost reduction beginning April this year, due to global low energy prices. Piarapakaran pointed out that the Energy, Green Technology and Water Ministry (KeTTHA) had announced in a statement on Jan 21 that any decrease or increase in the world crude oil prices can only be reflected in the price of LNG for Peninsular Malaysia, after five to seven months. KeTTHA\\u2019s statement had said that this was due to the fact that the market price of LNG supplied to Peninsular Malaysia is linked to the ex-Bintulu LNG Price and the Japan Customs-Cleared Crude (JCCC) price, with a time lag of 2-4 months and 5-7 months respectively, said Piarapakaran. \\u201c[So] why is the government increasing natural gas price, while Malaysia is supposed to enjoy cost reduction now, due to the time lag effect in LNG price? Does the price difference between piped gas and LNG equate to cost of liquefaction, shipping and regasification of LNG?,\\u201d he asked. \\u201cHas there been a transparent calculation reflecting international pricing mechanism that is widely accepted?\\u201d he further questioned. \\u00a0 This is the second natural gas tariff increase in less than nine months.

The 207-room five-star urban resort hotel on Jalan Ampang, close to the iconic Petronas Twin Towers, is believed to have already drawn interest from potential buyers, including foreign investors. SDB (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 3.0), when contacted via email to confirm if it was seeking to dispose of the asset, would only say that there had been interest in the hotel. \\u201cWith regard to Hotel Maya, we have been getting strong interest in the hotel for the past six months,\\u201d Lina Othman, SDB\\u2019s head, communications and corporate affairs, tells The Edge. \\u201cAs a business owner, we are always open to any business opportunity that may arise and are also on the lookout for any prospective business development potential. As you know, SDB is a property company and our core business is property development,\\u201d she says. SDB did not disclose the price at which it would be willing to let go of the property. The company\\u2019s 2014 annual report shows that the net book value of this freehold property was RM150 million as at March 31, 2014. According to the project manifest prepared for potential buyers that was sighted by The Edge, the hotel was originally built with 280 rooms. Ten years later, in 2005, following extensive renovations, some rooms were merged to offer larger units. This resulted in the room inventory being reduced to 207. The new owner, however, has the option to revert to the original room count, if it wishes to. The document also reveals that the asking price for this accommodation is RM800,000 per room. Based on the 280-room inventory, this works out to RM224 million. The owner is also asking RM22.35 million for the parking bays, bringing the total to RM246.35 million. The final asking price has been set at around RM231.35 million as the price is being reduced by a total of RM15 million in room conversion cost. SDB has appointed Zerin Properties as its exclusive agent to conduct the sale. In terms of performance, in the financial year ended March 31, 2014, the hotel\\u2019s average occupancy rate declined to 58.9% from 62.3%. Total hotel revenue in FY2014 rose 2.99% to RM27.5 million, contributing 7.3% to total group revenue of RM322.28 million. But in that same year, the hotel\\u2019s net operating profit slipped to RM428,000 from RM1.4 million achieved in FY2013. SDB attributed the impact on its bottom line to lower occupancy and average room rate. There was also an impact from the introduction of the minimum wage, increase in energy tariffs and property assessment rates. SDB said it had also spent a significant amount on engineering expenses to look into wear and tear rectifications in the hotel building and operating equipment. The project manifest projects that in 2016, with a 280-room inventory it will be able to achieve an occupancy rate of 72% and average room rate of RM450. It also forecast that the rooms will be able to rake in RM33.2 million in revenue while the food and beverage segment will add another RM17.88 million. It further indicates that the earnings after tax could be as much as RM11.47 million in 2016 and increase to RM14.69 million by 2020. Meanwhile, in the nine months ended Dec 31, 2014, SDB posted a group revenue of RM296.12 million, up 7.37% from RM275.79 million in the previous corresponding period due to better work progress in two of its property development projects \\u2014 Windows On The Park in Cheras and By The Sea in Penang. The hotel operations contributed RM17.92 million in revenue in the first three quarters of FY2015, or just 6% of total revenue. Net profit for the period was lower at RM31.03 million, compared with RM33.41 million previously. This was attributed to the impact from the slowdown in the tourism industry, which adversely affected its hotel business. In its 19-year history, the hotel has changed names at least four times. It first opened in 1996 as Radisson Plaza and subsequently operated as Park Plaza. Later, the owners decided to take over the management from the international operators and renamed it Grand Maya Hotel. In 2005, after a RM46 million renovation, it reopened as Hotel Maya and was marketed as an urban resort hotel. Facilities include an indoor pool and a sky lounge. The building has a gross floor area of 38,991 sq m, with the hotel component taking up 26,229 sq m and the car park the remaining space.

From an all-time low of 5 sen and market capitalisation of a mere RM28 million at the beginning of the year, it closed last Friday at 20.5 sen, with a market capitalisation of RM128.8 million. The rally came before last Friday\\u2019s signing of a collaboration agreement with Zhiyuan Investment Group Co Ltd, which will invest RM300 million to equip and upgrade Perwaja\\u2019s Kemaman plant in Terengganu to make stainless steel. However, it is still too early to say if the Chinese firm has cemented its commitment in Perwaja (fundamental: 0; valuation: 0). This is because the initial RM300 million plan, covering an 18-month period, will only involve the Chinese party leasing and equipping the Kemaman plant. Pending regulatory approval of Perwaja\\u2019s restructuring scheme to deal with its RM2.2 billion debt liabilities, it is learnt that subscription of equity by the Chinese firm will only come after one year, possibly via \\u201cinjecting\\u201d its machinery installed and related upgrading works at the Kemaman plant, into Perwaja. But details remain sketchy at this juncture. According to information given at the signing, Zhiyuan\\u2019s initial RM300 million investment will be divided into two phases. Under the first phase, the Chinese firm will invest RM100 million, of which RM30 million will be a security deposit for the leasing of the Kemaman plant from Perwaja, and the balance being the value of new machinery that it will bring into the plant. For the second phase, Zhiyuan will invest RM200 million to further equip or upgrade the plant, with the aim of producing 400,000 tonnes of semi-finished stainless steel slabs every year. Further investments by Zhiyuan will only be revealed 18 months down the road under the third phase of Perwaja\\u2019s five-year revival plan that will see it producing 800,000 tonnes of alloy steel per year. When asked about the immediate plans, Perwaja\\u2019s director Tan Sri Pheng Yin Huah says if everything goes smoothly, a formal agreement will be signed between Perwaja and Zhiyuan within three months and the production line in Kemaman plant will be reactivated in six months. Pheng\\u2019s listed vehicle Kinsteel Bhd currently owns 31.25% of Perwaja. \\u201cI believe Perwaja\\u2019s collaboration with Zhiyuan at this juncture is timely as demand for stainless steel has been stable, while we can avoid stiff competition in the traditional market due to duplication of products,\\u201d Pheng told reporters after the collaboration ceremony last Friday. While he offered no details, the Kuantan-based businessman says\\u00a0 Zhiyuan is expected to emerge as a substantial shareholder of Perwaja. \\u201cEven though Kinsteel\\u2019s shareholding in Perwaja will be reduced post-restructuring, we will remain a major team member.\\u201d Perwaja director Datuk Alan Ong says the entry of Zhiyuan will inevitably see a dilution of the present substantial shareholders\\u2019 stakes in the steelmaker. \\u201cImportantly, Kinsteel\\u2019s stake in Perwaja will be reduced. But Kinsteel will stay on as a significant shareholder in Perwaja,\\u201d he stresses. Another substantial shareholder of Perwaja is Tan Sri Abu Sahid\\u2019s Maju Holdings. Ong says it is premature to talk about how Perwaja would facilitate the entry of Zhiyuan as a shareholder or the size of the latter\\u2019s stake. It is worth noting that at the group level, Perwaja has accumulated losses of RM1.89 billion, as well as total debt liabilities of RM2.22 billion owed to banks, statutory bodies as well as energy suppliers Tenaga Nasional Bhd and Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas). Perwaja\\u2019s Kemaman plant was forced to close in August 2013 after its energy supply was cut as the company had repeatedly missed payments to Tenaga and Petronas. Of the RM2.22 billion debt, Ong says Perwaja owes RM450 million to Tenaga and Petronas, RM200 million to the Ministry of Finance and the balance to banks and other creditors. The proposed corporate and debt restructuring scheme is subject to the approval of Perwaja\\u2019s creditors and regulatory authorities. \\u201cWe hope that the creditors are in favour of what we are doing. {To restart Kemaman plant}, we need the banks\\u2019 consent because the land is currently charged to them. If they say no (to Zhiyuan), we can\\u2019t even start,\\u201d says Ong. He, declines to comment on whether the creditors will have to take a haircut. On leasing the Kemaman plant to Zhiyuan, Ong explains that at the initial stages, the Chinese firm will import machinery from China to facilitate the quick start-up of operations for the manufacturing of intermediate alloy steel-related products. \\u201cThese operations will later dovetail into the manufacturing operations of Kemaman plant, which will be modified for the eventual production of stainless steel products,\\u201d he says. In conjunction with that \\u2014 if market regulators approve the restructuring scheme \\u2014 Perwaja will carry out a fundraising exercise and use the proceeds to purchase the new machinery brought in by Zhiyuan as well as refund the safe deposit to the latter. Should Zhiyuan also participate in the fundraising exercise, the scheme could be seen as the Chinese firm injecting its machinery into Perwaja in return for a substantial stake. News of Zhiyuan coming in has lifted sentiment on Perwaja\\u2019s stock. However, market observers warn of the potentially huge dilution to existing shareholders, noting that Zhiyuan\\u2019s initial RM300 million investment alone is 2.3 times Perwaja\\u2019s current market capitalisation of RM130 million. There is also the risk that if things do not work out, Zhiyuan may relocate its machinery back to China. Nevertheless, for now, Zhiyuan\\u2019s entry is crucial to restart the Kemaman plant and rehire some of the workers who have been out of work for almost two years.

Its subsidiary, Sandvik South East Asia Pte Ltd (Asia Pacific) oil and gas regional sales manager Benno Wagner told reporters today that though it worked with Petronas on four projects here, regular discussions were ongoing with the latter as it was a major player in this region. \\u201cWe currently work on four projects with Petronas, in which we supply corrosion resistant super-duplex stainless steel tubing, umbilical tubing and oil country tubular goods (OCTG). \\u201cOur discussions include showcases of our latest products, including the hyper-duplex umbilical tubing SAF3207 that are used for drilling in water depths more than 3,000 metres and withstand pressures of 20,000 PSI (pounds per square inch),\\u201d he said on the sidelines of the Oil and Gas Asia 2015 event.

Wagner added that while this year has been challenging for the industry due to the drop in crude oil price, Sandvik was able to sustain the downturn because its contracts commenced before the slump in October last year. \\u201cWe could become affected after 2016 if conditions continue as is next year. But for now, we cannot say how bad the impact would be for us next year because we cannot predict oil prices,\\u201d he said. He added that corrosion of tubing materials in seas here was one of Sandvik\\u2019s main challenges in this region, but was keen on overcoming the problem for its customers that wanted to move into deeper waters. This was a result of reduced stock in shallow waters that has spurred oil players to seek production at lower depths, he said, adding that Sandvik\\u2019s customers in West Australia would be utilising its SAF3207 tubing next year. \\u201cAs subsea oil and gas productions move to deeper wells, operations at higher pressures and in more adverse conditions are required.

Petronas Dagangan chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director Mohd Ibrahimnuddin Mohd Yunus notes that it is crucial to look for the optimal inventory level to make sure that its retailing segment does not keep too much stock as the possibility of a further fall on oil prices lurks. \\u201cWe order our supplies at the right moment and right time to ensure our stocks are not too high if there\\u2019s a plunge in oil prices in the future,\\u201d Ibrahimnuddin explained to 180 students at The Edge Billion Ringgit Club \\u201cMeet the CEO\\u201d event at the KDU University College Glenmarie campus last Friday. \\u201cMeanwhile you have got to be very careful because you don\\u2019t want to disappoint your customers to a point that there\\u2019s no stock in your retail store,\\u201d he said, adding that the company also needs to ensure the efficiency of its supply and distribution.

Normally, we register [quarterly] profit between RM150 million and RM200 million every quarter.

Revenue came in 11% lower at RM7.45 billion from RM8.39 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share fell to 0.04 sen from 15.2 sen a year ago. The deterioration of its 4QFY14 results was mainly because of the decrease in sales volume and average selling price, Petronas Dagangan explained in its results note. For the full FY14, Petronas Dagangan\\u2019s net profit slumped to RM501.57 million from RM811.75 million the year before, although its revenue was flat at RM32.34 billion.

The low-cost airline recorded a 6.9% increase in net profit to RM149.33 million or 5.4 sen per share in 1QFY15, from RM139.72 million or 5 sen per share a year ago, as it benefited from lower fuel expenses and a gain on disposal of interest in AirAsia Expedia Travel.

It said the profit rise was also due to a higher foreign exchange gain of RM232.6 million, higher unrealised mark-to-market gain on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) of RM213.1 million, and higher fee income of RM151.9 million. Genting Malaysia Bhd\\u2019s net profit grew a marginal 1% to RM362.10 million in the first quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1QFY15), from RM358.29 million a year ago, mainly due to contributions from its Malaysia and US operations. Revenue was up 3% at RM2.09 billion, from RM2.03 billion in 1QFY14, its filing on Bursa showed. Genting Malaysia (fundamental: 2.4; valuation: 0.8) also said its Malaysian business\\u2019 revenue grew 2% to RM1.39 billion, primarily on higher volume of business, despite lower hold percentage in the premium players business. Revenue from the group\\u2019s US operations, including Resorts World Bimini (Bimini) in the Bahamas, improved by 22% to RM313.8 million, largely contributed by higher volumes of business from the Resorts World Casino New York City (RWNYC) and Bimini operations. Its UK business revenue, however, fell 7% to RM355.7 million, mainly due to lower hold percentage and volume of business in its international markets division, which cater to the premium players business. Goldis Bhd\\u2019s net profit jumped 71% on-year to RM33.39 million or 5.49 sen per share for its first quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1QFY15), from RM19.56 million or 3.31 sen per share, as its property development segment saw a 95% revenue spike. The group\\u2019s revenue for the quarter was up 13% on-year at RM365.50 million, from RM322.06 million, a filing with Bursa showed. The increase in revenue was mainly contributed by the property development segment, which leapt to RM89.4 million, from RM45.8 million in 1QFY14, on the completion and hand-over of 468 units of service apartments at G Residence, which achieved over 93% in sales with a value of RM157 million, said Goldis (fundamental: 0.5; valuation: 1.1). Karex Bhd saw its net profit rise 31.8% to RM15.21 million or 2.45 sen a share for the third financial quarter ended March 31, 2015 (3QFY15), from RM11.54 million or 1.9 sen a share a year earlier, on sales of higher profit margin products, favourable currency exchange rates and lower raw material prices. Revenue, however, was 4.3% lower at RM71.4 million, from RM74.62 million in 3QFY14, due to higher commercial orders received in the current quarter, resulting in longer lead time for production. The condom manufacturer's cumulative nine months (9MFY15) net profit increased to RM42.59 million or 6.96 sen a share, a 90.3% increase from RM22.38 million or 5.5 sen a share a year ago; while revenue also increased by 39.4% at RM218.53 million, from RM156.79 million in 9MFY14. In a filing with Bursa, Karex said demand for condoms remains strong around the world, with consumption of condoms expected to rise in tandem with population growth and increasing awareness on the importance of condom usage among the younger generations. IHH Healthcare Bhd\\u2019s net profit increased 7.8% to RM171.48 million or 2.1 sen per share in the first quarter ended March 31 (1QFY15), from RM159.05 million or 1.96 sen per share in the previous corresponding period, on higher inpatient admissions and overall revenue growth. In a filing with Bursa, IHH Healthcare (fundamental: 1.65; valuation: 0.7) posted a 13.6% increase in revenue to RM2 billion in 1QFY15, compared to RM1.76 billion in the first quarter of financial year 2014 (1QFY14). The company said the improved earnings were primarily driven by higher inpatient admission, overall revenue intensities and the ramp up of operations of Acibadem Atakent Hospital in Turkey, as well as Pantai Hospital Manjung in Malaysia \\u2014 both of which opened in 2014. IHH Healthcare also said the group reaped the benefits of its diversified operations across 10 countries, as a strong Singapore dollar helped to offset the translational loss of a weak Lira to the group\\u2019s reporting currency, the ringgit. Number forecast operator Magnum Bhd's net profit jumped 9.97% to RM90.76 million or 6.4 sen per share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1QFY15), from RM82.53 million or 5.8 sen per share a year ago, on higher gaming profit, mainly due to lower prizes payout. Magnum\\u2019s (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 1.4) quarterly revenue, however, fell slightly to RM791.28 million, from RM792.55 million in 1QFY14, on lower gaming sales for the current quarter, due to one less draw which was mitigated by higher sales from the jackpot game and contribution from the new game. CB Industrial Product Holding Bhd (CBIP) is expected to secure up to RM500 million worth of contracts for its palm oil engineering business, giving it a double-digit growth in revenue this year. Its managing director Lim Chai Beng said the group is currently bidding for 10 palm oil mill projects, worth some RM10 million to RM70 million each, with most of the projects located overseas, from Indonesia to Papua New Guinea. Year-to-date, CBIP has secured four palm oil mill contracts worth RM250 million, said Lim, who expects more contracts in the next two to three months. The current outstanding orderbook for the palm oil engineering division is RM420 million, which will last the group one-and-a-half years. RAM Rating Services Bhd downgraded its outlook on Tan Chong Motor Holdings Bhd\\u2019s long-term debt ratings to negative, from stable. In a statement, RAM's consumer and industrial ratings head Kevin Lim said the negative outlook on Tan Chong (fundamental: 0.55; valuation: 2), which distributes Nissan cars in Malaysia, was due to the company's cash flow-protection measures and profit margin concerns. The revision of the outlook is premised on RAM\\u2019s concern that the group\\u2019s cashflow-protection measures and margins will remain pressured by intense competition in the automotive industry and the weak ringgit, amidst dampening demand post-implementation of the GST. Engineering and construction services provider Kimlun Corp Bhd\\u2019s net profit for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1QFY15) was down 25.6% to RM14.12 million or 4.7 sen per share, from RM18.97 million or 7.02 sen per share a year ago, primarily due to gains made from land disposal in 1QFY14. Its revenue in 1QFY15 had also dipped 3.2% to RM322.17 million, from RM332.69 million in 1QFY14. Kimlun (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 2.4) said if contribution of the disposals is removed, the group would have achieved a growth in revenue and gross profit of 12.6% and 34.6% respectively in the current quarter, as compared to 1QFY14.\n\\u00a0\nThe construction division\\u2019s revenue, which improved by 14% with a few large projects secured, continued to be the main revenue contributor to the group \\u2014 making up 84% of the current quarter\\u2019s revenue. Perwaja Holdings Bhd saw its net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2015 at RM119.57 million, on zero production and low sales volume. It told Bursa that its financial year end has been changed to June 30, from Dec 31, to cover the 18-month period from Jan 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014, hence there is no corresponding quarter for comparison. Perwaja said within the current quarter under review, the group reported a revenue of RM200,000, mainly due to zero production and low sales volume. The zero production was affected by the gas and electricity supply curtailment by Petronas and TNB, at the material time, which had caused Perwaja\\u2019s unit Perwaja Steel Sdn Bhd (PSSB)'s to be unable to secure the necessary working capital for resumption of production. For the cumulative nine months ended March 31, the group's net loss was at RM233.72 million. Dominant Enterprise Bhd (DEB) has proposed a twin-bonus for shareholder: a bonus issue of some 27.5 million new shares, on the basis of one bonus share for every five shares held by its shareholders, together with the issuance of 45.8 million free warrants to accompany the bonus issue, on the basis of one warrant for every three existing shares held. DEB (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 3.0) said the entitlement date for the issuances will be determined at a later date. Meanwhile, DEB saw its net profit decline 24% to RM9.57 million or 6.96 sen per share for its fourth quarter ended March 31(4QFY15), from RM12.52 million or 8.99 sen per share a year earlier. The lower net profit was despite a 16% increase in revenue to RM143.63 million, from RM123.74 million in the previous year. The group proposed a single-tier final dividend payment of one sen per share for FY15, bringing its total dividend payment per share to five sen for the year. Full year net profit fell 3% year-on-year to RM22.43 million, from RM23.13 million; while revenue rose 15% to RM547.61 million, from RM477.73 million. DEB said its manufacturing division had posted lower operating profit of RM1.86 million in 4QFY15, despite an increase in revenue, market share expansion and newly-developed products. Lion Corp Bhd saw its net loss widen 14% to RM105.93 million for its third quarter ended March 31, 2015 (3QFY15), from a net loss of RM92.88 million a year before, as revenue dipped 6.6% to RM571.47 million, from RM611.93 million. For its nine months ended March 31 (9MFY15), Lion Corp\\u2019s net loss deteriorated 40% to RM315.17 million, from RM224.90 million in 9MFY14. Revenue meanwhile, declined 9% to RM1.65 billion, from RM1.82 billion during the same period, its filing to Bursa showed. The Practice Note 17 (PN17) company said its weaker 9MFY15 performance was due to sluggish demand for flat steel products in both the domestic and overseas market, and a foreign exchange loss of RM47 million resulting from the strengthening of the US dollar against the ringgit. The group said dumping activities by foreign millers remain rampant and that the group continues to run its plants at low production capacity, which caused it to incur losses for the quarter under review. Genting Bhd\\u2019s net profit for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1QFY15) went up 24.6% to RM620.1 million, from RM497.5 million, partly driven by gains on the disposal of financial assets. Revenue however, dipped 6.9% to RM4.37 billion, from RM4.69 billion in 1QFY14, its filing to Bursa showed. Genting (fundamental: 2.1: valuation: 0.8) saw lower revenues from Resorts World Sentosa (RWS)\\u2014 both the gaming and non-gaming segments; its casino business in the UK, its plantation segment, as well as its power division.

Uzma Bhd today announced its 40% associate company Sazma Aviation Sdn Bhd has secured two contracts from Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd for the provision of aviation services, collectively worth RM166.5 million. The first is a six-month contract worth RM12.5 million to provide helicopter services for Petroliam Nasional Bhd's (Petronas) well drilling campaign at the east coast of Sabah. Effective from May 15, the contract is expected to complete on Nov 14. The second contract, valued at RM154 million, is for the provision of aviation services for five years to Petronas Sabah Operations. The contract, which will commence from March 23 this year and end in March 22, 2020, carries a one-year extension option. Uzma (fundamental: 1.30; valuation: 1.50) said the contracts are expected to contribute positively to the earnings of the group for the financial year ending December 31, 2015 and in the future. Uzma also saw its net profit drop 4.4% to RM8.05 million or 3.01 sen a share for its first quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1QFY15) from RM8.43 million or 6.38 sen a share a year earlier, as higher gross profit was not enough to offset higher administrative and operating expenses and higher finance costs. The group's revenue for 1QFY15, however, grew 52% to RM148.53 million in 1QFY15 from RM97.72 million in 1QFY14, contributed by long-term contracts.

Eastern & Oriental Bhd (E&O)'s net profit for its fourth quarter of its 2015 financial year has doubled to RM100.76 million from RM50.5 million in its previous corresponding quarter, due to substantial divestment gains.\\u00a0 Revenue, however, declined nearly 38% to RM143.04 million from RM229.69 million a year ago. Cumulative net profit for the FY15 was up 34.5% to RM152.35 million from RM113.24 million in FY14, even though revenue was 9.6% lower at RM449.5 million against RM497.14 million in FY14. In a filing to Bursa Malaysia, E&O (fundamental: 1; valuation: 0.8) said that its rise in the fourth quarter's profit was driven by its investments and others segment. The increase in operating profit in the current financial year, meanwhile, is mainly due to a gain of RM100.533 million recognised during the current quarter, comprising of a gain of RM56.242 million on the disposal of 49% equity interest and a gain of RM44.3 million on re-measurement of its remaining 51% equity interest in Patsawan Properties Sdn Bhd.

UOA REIT (fundamental: 1.0; valuation: 2.3) told Bursa its total expenditure for the quarter has increased by 8%, mainly due to increases in property operating expenses and borrowing costs. Revenue for the 1QFY15 was RM22.78 million, up 3.34% from RM22.05 million last year from a 3% improved in gross rental from revision in rental rates and steady occupancy rates of its investment properties.

Its filing to Bursa today showed its revenue grow 8.1% to RM699.29 million from RM646.85 million, supported by greater contribution from its property development division, infrastructure services and integrated facilities management. At the conclusion of its annual general meeting today, UEM Edgenta (fundamental: 2.5; valuation: 1.1) managing director and chief executive officer Azmir Merican said the group expects to see growth this year on the back of key initiatives that were recently announced in the 11th Malaysia Plan. \"We are seeing opportunities in the 11th Malaysia Plan announcement.

It also recommended a single-tier dividend of 4 sen per share in respect of FY15, subject to shareholders' approval at its forthcoming annual general meeting. Comparatively, it declared a 2.5 sen dividend in the same period last year. Full year (FY15) net profit was, however, flat at RM74.295 million or 17.66 sen per share compared with RM74.62 million or 17.75 sen per share in FY14, despite revenue improving by 15.6% to RM616.31 million from RM533.13 million in FY14.

Hap Seng Plantations Holdings Bhd saw its net profit plummet 49% to RM21.49 million or 2.69 sen per share in the first quarter of financial year 2015 ended March 31, 2105 (1QFY15), compared to RM42.23 million, or 5.28 sen per share in the previous corresponding quarter as low palm oil prices, lower sales of palm kernel (PK) and higher production costs hit earnings.

Supermax Corp Bhd posted a net profit of RM24.95 million in the three months period ended Mar 31, 2015, a decline of 6.2% from RM26.6 million in the same period in the last financial year due to lower average selling prices. This translated to a lower earnings per share (EPS) of 3.67 sen compared to 3.91 sen a year earlier. In a filing with Bursa, Supermax (fundamental: 1.0; valuation: 1.8) \\u00a0said revenue was at RM223.21 million, down 4% compared to RM232.27 million. Supermax has changed its financial year end from Dec 31 to June 30. Kulim (Malaysia) Bhd's net profit for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1QFY15) surged over 35 times to RM1.36 billion or 102.51 sen a share from RM38.14 million or 2.98 sen a share a year ago, due to a gain of RM1.34 billion from the disposal of its stake in New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL). Kulim (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 2) had on Feb 26 this year completed the disposal of its entire equity interest in NBPOL to Sime Darby Bhd (fundamental: 1; valuation: 1.4) for \\u00a37.15 per share or \\u00a3525.4 million (RM2.75 billion). Stripping out the disposal gain, Kulim's profit from continuing operations would have been 11.6% lower to RM15.03 million in 1QFY15 from RM17 million a year ago. Revenue for 1QFY15, meanwhile, declined 2.9% to RM268.17 million from RM276.2 million in 1QFY14, dragged by poor performance of its plantation division, which registered a 30.5% and an 81% slump in revenue and pre-tax profit respectively. Signature International Bhd saw a net profit of RM13.39 million or 11.2 sen per share in the third quarter ended March 31, 2015 (3QFY15), up 225% from RM4.12 million or 3.5 sen per share a year earlier, on higher revenue from its kitchen and wardrobe segment and improved margin. Revenue increased 109% to RM87.54 million from RM41.9 million, which Signature (fundamental: 2.3; valuation: 1.5) said was due to higher revenue from project division of kitchen and wardrobe segment and manufacturing of glass and aluminium products. Signature proposed a first interim dividend of four sen per share for FY15, payable on July 2, 2015. For the nine-month period (9MFY15), Signature posted a net profit of RM32.25 million or 26.9 sen per share, up 256% from RM9.06 million or 7.6 sen per share on higher revenue and margins. Revenue rose 95% to RM217.97 million from RM111.83 million in 9MFY14. Project division of kitchen and wardrobe segment has been the main contributor to the increase. Boustead Holdings Bhd's net profit for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1QFY15) has plunged 99.8% to RM100,000 or 0.01 sen per share from RM56.4 million or 5.45 sen per share a year ago, on lower revenue. Revenue was down 24.3% to RM1.89 billion from RM2.499 billion in 1QFY14, its filing to Bursa Malaysia today showed. Despite the weaker financials, Boustead (fundamental: 0.65; valuation: 2) declared its first interim dividend of 5 sen per share in 1QFY15, which will be paid on June 30, 2015. In a media statement, Boustead deputy chairman and group managing director Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin said 1QFY15 has been a challenging period as external pressures and a general 'wait-and-see' mood in the consumer market is definitely bearing down on the group's earnings. Segmentally, Boustead's plantation revenue registered an 80% slump in pre-tax profit and a 32.4% drop in revenue, which the group blamed on declining fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production (down 16%) and bearish palm product prices. Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd's (fundamental: 2.3; valuation: 2.1) net profit fell 9.8% to RM47.23 million or 15.45 sen per share in the first quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1QFY15) from RM52.33 million or 17.12 sen a year ago, as customers opted to maintain minimal stocks ahead of the goods and services tax (GST) implementation. Revenue dropped 3.7% to RM429.45 million in 1QFY15 from RM445.94 million in 1QFY14. Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd (FGV) (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 1.4) ventured into the Philippines markets to supply its premier oil palm seeds to planters in Mindanao. In a statement, FGV said its subsidiary Felda Agriculture Services Sdn Bhd (FASSB) has signed a memorandum of collaboration with Bali Oil Palm Produce Corporation (BOPPC) to explore the possibility of collaborating with each other in agricultural related products and services. According to FGV, FASSB is committed to deliver the first oil palm seeds to Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) and BOPPC in 2015. FASSB will deliver 110,000 DxP oil palm germinated seeds to PCA and one million DxP oil palm germinated seeds to BOPPC commencing June 2015, FGV said. FGV also believes the collaboration will be a springboard for Mindanao to become one of the major world-class palm oil exporters together with FGV and other world's top producer. Snacks and candies manufacturer Cocoaland Holdings Bhd said it has decided to reject Navis Asia Fund VII, LP's takeover offer of RM377.52 million or RM2.20 per share. In a statement to the bourse today, Cocoaland said its board of directors have deliberated on the proposed acquisition by Navis Asia VII Management Company Ltd, who made the offer on behalf of Navis Asia Fund VII, and \"unanimously rejected the offer\". \"The offer price for the proposed acquisition was RM377.52 million (RM2.20 per share),\" it added. Last Friday, Cocoaland (fundamental: 2.5; valuation: 1.4) said it had received a 'non-binding indicative offer letter' from Navis Asia VII to acquire all its assets and liabilitites. The offer price of the acquisition was not disclosed back then, and the counter was suspended from trading until 5pm on Monday; it will resume trading tomorrow. Separately, Cocoaland saw its net profit more than double to RM8.01 million or 4.67 sen per share for the quarter ended Mar 31, 2015 (1QFY15) from RM3.41 million or 1.99 sen per share a year ago, mainly on increased trading volume from its contract manufacturing of hard candy production. Revenue grew only 14.32% to RM67.74 million in 1QFY15 from RM59.25 million last year, but lower advertisement expense incurred and lower impairment of receivables also facilitated better profit margin for the group, the filing showed.

The shipping company broke its silence after a week, saying, \\u201cIn response to recent market speculation, MISC confirms that petroleum shipping is a core element of its current and ongoing business and, as such, has no plans to divest itself of its petroleum tanker subsidiary\\u201d, referring to the rumoured sale of AET. This response \\u2014 much clearer than the one issued earlier in the week that \\u201cMISC is not in a position to comment on Teekay\\u2019s business plans\\u201d \\u2014 should put an end to the speculation. Nevertheless, MISC\\u2019s shares, which have been climbing steadily since early 2013, soared to a record high of RM9.35 last Friday from RM7.20 in January \\u2014 up nearly 30% year to date. The excitement could have been created by the over US$2 billion price tag on AET\\u2019s fleet of 72 tankers, according to online platform VesselsValue.com. Had the sale materialised at this estimated price, more than RM7 billion cash or RM1.57 per share would have been added to MISC\\u2019s coffers. A shipping industry veteran acknowledges that he had heard that Teekay was looking at AET. \\u201cTeekay is a well-run company, its management is good and it could be looking to beef up its fleet,\\u201d he says, adding though that he was not sure if MISC was interested in selling. AET chief executive Hor Weng Yew was quoted by the media as saying, \\u201cIndustry participants talk about mergers and acquisitions all the time but one shouldn\\u2019t believe in rumours.\\u201d He said AET was continuously renewing its fleet. \\u201cFinancial returns have picked up for tanker owners and operators globally in recent months but the outlook is still not conducive for investing in fleet expansion. \\u201cEarnings have improved but from the investment perspective for the long term, they are still not good enough,\\u201d Hor was quoted by energy and metals information provider Platts as saying on the sidelines of an international oil pollution conference organised by Singapore\\u2019s Maritime and Port Authority. Nevertheless, rumours of AET being up for sale are not surprising, considering MISC\\u2019s penchant for asset disposal and the difficult environment in which AET is operating. Indeed, AET posted losses in its financial year ended Dec 31, 2012 (FY2012) and FY2013. It suffered an after-tax loss of RM555.8 million on revenue of RM2.5 billion in FY2013. Its financial performance was almost identical the year before \\u2014 an after-tax loss of RM553.6 million on revenue of RM2.6 billion. As at Dec 31, 2013, AET had non-current assets of RM9.4 billion and current assets of almost RM1.2 billion. Long-term liabilities stood at RM5.6 billion while short-term debt commitments amounted to RM711.2 million. Looking at AET\\u2019s financial performance, it actually makes sense to sell the company. An analyst with a local brokerage firm offers a possible reason for MISC to hive off AET \\u2014 a weak lightering market in the US, which is key to the latter. Lightering is the transfer of cargo \\u2014 in this case, oil \\u2014 to a facility onshore from a small vessel. An example would be an Aframax tanker removing cargo from a very large crude carrier (VLCC). Of AET\\u2019s 72 vessels, 48 are Aframax tankers that are usually involved in lightering. In the US, the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port is the only facility at which a VLCC can berth, so lightering is needed to transport crude oil to the onshore refineries. AET has been a victim of the contraction in the US oil imports in recent years, due partly to the development of unconventional energy \\u2014 shale gas, of which the world\\u2019s largest economy has ample supply. Data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) indicates that the US imported 9.2 million barrels of crude oil per day in 2010 but only 7.3 million per day last year \\u2014 down almost 21%. According to EIA, 27% of the petroleum consumed by the US was imported last year, the lowest level since 1985. Petroleum includes crude oil and gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, jet fuel, chemical feedstock, asphalt, biofuel (ethanol and biodiesel) and other products. While Teekay has also been adversely affected by the lower oil imports of the US, it posted a net profit of US$33.9 million on revenue of US$235.6 million in FY2014. As at Dec 31, 2014, Teekay had US$162.8 million in cash, which means it would have borrowed heavily to acquire AET. In terms of fleet size, Teekay is smaller with a fleet of 32 vessels. The acquisition of AET would have expanded its fleet substantially \\u2014 by about three times. In fact, in 2003, when MISC purchased AET for US$445 million, the latter\\u2019s fleet size was the same as Teekay\\u2019s. On top of that, MISC funded a US$75 million dividend from AET to Neptune Orient Lines, the company that had owned AET. Later, MISC transferred its crude petroleum tanker assets to AET, expanding the latter\\u2019s fleet to more than 50 vessels and forming assets worth in excess of US$2 billion. Had MISC sold AET, its fleet would have been reduced to about 60 ships, almost half of them liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers and a quarter of them offshore floating facilities. In FY2014 ended Dec 31, MISC registered a net profit of RM2.2 billion on almost RM9.3 billion in sales. Its energy-related shipping division accounted for 67% or RM6.23 billion of the group\\u2019s revenue and 81% of its operating profit of RM1.84 billion. For some analysts, MISC without AET, and only its LNG tankers and 66.5%-owned fabricator Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Bhd (MMHE), would be \\u201cunexciting\\u201d, considering that the latter is not performing well. MMHE has been dogged by a lack of jobs, which is surprising, considering that MISC is 62.7%-controlled by national oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas). In its final quarter of 2014, MMHE registered a meagre profit of RM16.5 million on revenue of RM508.3 million. \\u201cMMHE is not competitive, so while its parent (Petronas) gives it jobs, this is not often or consistent enough,\\u201d says an analyst. MISC\\u2019s management would also have to be more aggressive and proactive if it did sell AET. \\u201cMISC is lethargic and was slow to exit the container business \\u2026 it left at the end of 2011 but container shipping was already in a downturn after the 2008 global financial crisis. In three years, the ships aged as well,\\u201d says the analyst. At the end of last year, MISC sold its 15.7% stake in NCB Holdings for RM221.9 million or RM3 per share. While the selling price was at a premium to NCB\\u2019s trading price at the time, the stock had not traded lower in four years and last traded at the RM3 level in mid-2011 and above RM4.80 in mid-2014. The analyst opines that perhaps it is best for MISC \\u201cto stick with AET and ride the cyclical shipping waves together\\u201d.

Meanwhile, Ling acknowledged that Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u2019s (Petronas) announcement to renegotiate for lower charter rates in the offshore supply vessel market due to lower crude oil prices may impact Perdana\\u2019s earnings. But he pointed out that the impact is industry-wide and not unique to Perdana. Thus far, the group has agreed to provide discounts in one or two of its charter contracts, which Ling said Perdana had \\u201cmore or less\\u201d recouped most of its investments. However, the group may find it difficult to provide discounts for newly secured charter contracts as the investment recoupment is huge, according to Ling. \\u201cThey (Petronas) ask us to reduce the rates a lot, [but it is] very difficult because we have invested big money and have not recovered it,\\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Perdana yesterday announced that its net profit for the first quarter ended March 31 plunged by 60% to RM8.64 million from RM22 million a year ago. Revenue contracted 20% to RM69.5 million, compared with RM87.3 million a year ago. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia yesterday, the group said the steady decline in profits and revenue was due to lower vessel utilisation from the slower work orders and contract awards from the oil majors caused by the low crude oil price. On Dayang\\u2019s equity stake, last week, Dayang (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 2.1) announced it had entered into a conditional share sale agreement with Affin Hwang Asset Management Bhd to acquire its 5.74% stake, or 42.96 million shares, in Perdana, at RM1.55 per share or RM66.59 million in total. The share purchase would raise Dayang\\u2019s shareholding in Perdana to 35.51% from 29.77%. Consequently, Dayang is obliged to launch a mandatory general offer to all shareholders in Perdana at RM1.55 per share. Dayang wants to have Perdana remain as a listed entity.

Cahya Mata Sarawak Bhd\\u2019s (CMS) share price is hovering at a record high currently. The stock had risen from a low of RM3.35 in mid-December last year to RM4.96 last Thursday. CMS\\u2019 associate company, KKB Engineering Bhd (fundamental: 2.5; valuation: 1.4), has also seen keen interest of late. Its share price has gained 23% in the past fortnight, giving it a market capitalisation of RM435.7 million. From RM1.37 on April 2, the stock rose to RM1.69 on April 15. Trading volume has picked up as well with 1.3 million shares traded on April 15 compared with 88,900 shares on April 1. Analysts say apart from the election theme, the rise in KKB\\u2019s share price could be due to the expectation that the company would be a beneficiary of CMS\\u2019\\u00a0recently awarded RM308 million contract to build a world-class museum and heritage trail in Kuching. CMS (fundamental: 3; valuation: 1.1) is a major shareholder in KKB with a 20.1% stake. Only Sarawak\\u2019s polls are held at a different time from the general election. The 10th Sarawak election was in April 2011. \\u201cThe CMS contract could signal the start of more projects to come, ahead of the impending state election. As we noted earlier, there is a possibility that CMS will subcontract some jobs to KKB, insofar as they relate to steel fabrication and supply of pipes,\\u201d says AmResearch analyst Thomas Soon, who tracks Sarawak-based companies. On the museum contract, Maybank Investment Bank Research, in an April 15 report, states that it represents CMS\\u2019 first major construction job win since 2009, lifting its order book by a significant 51% to an estimated RM908 million. The research house points out that this could be a prelude to more construction job wins for CMS in the near term, especially works related to the Pan-Borneo Highway and Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy (SCORE). \\u201cMeanwhile, its cement and construction material businesses are key beneficiaries of the growing construction activities, driven by the upcoming state election, the Pan-Borneo Highway and the 11th Malaysia Plan,\\u201d it adds. While the awarding of infrastructure jobs in Sarawak is picking up, analysts say the macro operating landscape continues to be tough for companies there, and KKB is no exception. \\u201cKKB has seen a slowdown in its conventional steel fabrication/engineering business, and the operating landscape remains challenging. Its prospects will largely hinge on its oil and gas venture, through its associate OceanMight Sdn Bhd, which has the expertise and capacity,\\u201d says Soon. \\u201cDespite a tougher operating environment for oil and gas companies, we still expect them (KKB\\u2019s associate) to get projects from Petronas. They are now finishing their RM20 million maiden project.\\u201d It has not been plain sailing for KKB all these years. Its 43%-owned associate OceanMight became a Petronas-licensed fabricator in 2013. Being the only fabricator in Sarawak, it was expected to stand a better chance of landing jobs than players from the peninsula, but so far it has yet to generate any major contribution. The sharp fall in crude oil prices, which is causing a slowdown in the oil and gas sector, has not helped matters either. KKB started diversifying, which includes its venture into the oil and gas sector, as it has a long-term plan to move up the value chain in structural steel fabrication. Apart from its core steel fabrication business, it is into civil construction as well as the manufacture of steel pipes and liquefied petroleum gas cylinders. \\u00a0 Over the years, KKB\\u2019s margins have been declining, from 44.11% in 2010 to 28.57% last year. Its earnings have been on a downward trend as well. For the financial year ended Dec 31, 2014, KKB saw its net profit drop almost 32% year on year to RM23.9 million. Likewise, its gross dividend per share decreased from 17.5 sen in FY2010 to only four sen in FY2014. Even so, the group saw its cash triple to RM98.6 million as at Dec 31, 2014, from RM37.5 million a year earlier. AmResearch\\u2019s Soon observes that there has been a decline in large investments in Samalaju Industrial Park, a SCORE hub that front-loaded investments for the major engineering projects. \\u201cWhat are left now are piping jobs that have lower margins compared with engineering. However, there are other growth nodes within SCORE that can still bring in jobs,\\u201d he says. \\u201cWhat we need to see that will help companies like KKB is a step-up in rural infrastructure work in Sarawak. The Pan-Borneo Highway will help as it will be spread out evenly among companies, including privately owned entities. We do not expect just one major player to get a chunk of it.\\u201d In a Feb 18 report, AmResearch notes that\\u00a0KKB\\u2019s unbilled sales stand at RM105 million, which would last nine months. It adds that KKB has bid for RM47 million worth of conventional (steel structure/engineering) jobs, over and above its earlier bids of RM130 million. \\u201cWe are assuming new orders of RM250 million, RM280 million and RM300 million over the next three years,\\u201d says the research house, which has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the stock, with a fair value of RM2.05.

The research house pointed out that Perdana currently has five workbarges and a workboat deployed to Dayang on long-term charters. \\u201cThe control of Perdana would give Dayang better access to Perdana\\u2019s young fleet of 19 vessels, of which 17 are in operation and two are due for delivery in financial year 2016 (FY16),\\u201d it said. Meanwhile, Kenanga Research noted that it is no secret that Dayang intends to take Perdana private. This is due to the more compelling valuation of Perdana following the crude oil price slump while synergistic benefits can also be achieved with Perdana\\u2019s fleet of vessels complementing Dayang\\u2019s hook-up and commissioning (HUC) capabilities. \\u201cWe believe the deal could put Dayang in a better position to target a bigger slice of the next round of the Pan Malaysia HUC Umbrella contract (possibly worth RM10 billion) expected to be awarded in 2018 to 2019,\\u201d said Kenanga.

Coupled with higher costs, the company said compounding factors resulted in a higher percentage drop in revenue for the same period. For the cumulative nine-month period (9MFY15), REDtone\\u2019s net profit contracted 12.3% to RM12.88 million or 2.47 sen a share, from RM14.68 million or 2.9 sen a share a year ago. This came on the back of a 10.2% improvement in REDtone\\u2019s revenue for 9MFY15 to RM118.49 million, from RM107.48 million a year ago. Ancom Bhd (fundamental: 0.55; valuation: 1.2) swung to a net loss of RM2.27 million in the third financial quarter ended Feb 28, 2015 (3QFY15), compared to a net profit of RM3.76 million a year ago, mainly due to lower contribution from its investment holding, agricultural and industrial chemicals, information technology, as well as logistics divisions. This translates into a loss per share of 1.05 sen in 3QFY15, from an earnings per share of 1.74 sen per share in 3QFY14. Its revenue for 3QFY15 dipped 14.56% to RM339.64 million, from RM397.53 million a year ago. For the nine months period (9MFY15), the group posted a net loss of RM2.24 million, as compared to a net profit of RM9.95 million a year ago; while revenue fell 19.72% to RM1.14 billion, from RM1.42 billion in 9MFY14. Going forward, Ancom said its agricultural and industrial chemicals, as well as polymer divisions, are expecting challenging business environment with continued pressure on profit margin, as product suppliers and logistic providers seek higher prices. Taliworks Corp Bhd (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 2.4) is looking at one or two mergers and acquisitions (M&A) involving operational brownfield infrastructure assets in Australia and other foreign markets, to increase its revenue. Executive director Lim Yew Boon told reporters today that the M&A move \\u2014 which is being pursued by Taliworks EPF Instructure Sdn Bhd (TEI), its 51:49 joint venture firm with the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) \\u2014 is however only at its exploratory stage at the moment. He said TEI is looking at acquiring long-term highway concessionaires that have strong recurring assets. As for the group, Taliworks has a few infrastructure projects, including water supply ones, earmarked in the current financial year. Taliworks' order book stands currently at RM500 million. Lim said the group was confident of seeing a slight improvement in its revenue in its next financial quarter (2QFY15), following the contribution from the water tariff reviews in Selangor and Langkawi, Kedah, early last year. Petronas Gas Bhd (PetGas) will allocate RM5 billion as capital expenditure (capex) over the next five years. Managing director cum chief executive officer Yusa Hassan said 60% of the capex would finance PetGas' (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 1.1) liquified natural gas (LNG) regasification terminal and air separation projects in Pengerang, Johor. The balance 40% portion is for maintenance and operation capex, according to him. Yusa also said the company's \"immediate growth\" would come from the LNG regasification and air separation projects. On the regasification terminal, he expects the first tank to start operations by the end of 2017, while the second tank is anticipated to commence operations in the middle of 2018. Yusa said the air separation unit was expected to begin operations by end of 2018. MISC Bhd\\u2019s (fundamental: 2; valuation: 1) first quarter net profit came in flat at RM486.31 million, as compared to the RM486.4 million it saw a year earlier, on lower income from liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipping operations and higher cost at its heavy engineering unit. MISC said higher minority interest also led to lower profit in the first quarter ended March 31, 2015, from RM486.4 million. Revenue however rose 8.7% to RM2.49 billion, from RM2.29 billion. It said group operating profit of RM468.2 million was 7.2% lower than the corresponding quarter's profit of RM504.3 million, mainly due to lower revenue in LNG business and additional costs incurred on some heavy engineering projects. However, higher profit in offshore business and lower losses in chemical business helped to mitigate the decrease in group operating profit, said MISC, which is a 62.67%-owned subsidiary of Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas). MISC's heavy engineering unit comes under 66.5%-owned unit, Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd. Particleboard maker HeveaBoard Bhd (fundamental: 1.3, valuation: 1.4) has proposed a 1-to-4 share split of every one of its existing ordinary share of RM1, held on an entitlement date to be determined later, into four shares of 25 sen each. HeveaBoard said the proposed share split, to be implemented within the next one month, is expected to \\u201cenhance the marketability and trading liquidity\\u201d of the shares of the company. It further noted that the proposed corporate exercise will result in an adjustment to the market price of the ordinary shares of HeveaBoard, making the shares more affordable to appeal to a wider group of public shareholders and/or investors to participate in the company\\u2019s growth. The company\\u2019s issued and paid-up share capital currently stands at RM99.45 million, comprising 99.45 million shares. The company has 42.66 million outstanding warrants prior now. Assuming the full exercise of the warrants prior to the entitlement date, the enlarged issued and paid-up share capital of the company shall be RM142.11 million, comprising 568.43 subdivided shares, upon completion of the proposed share split. Parkson Holdings Bhd said its indirect subsidiary Parkson Corp Sdn Bhd (PCSB) has entered into an agreement with Studio Kingdoms Network Sdn Bhd (SKN) to establish a 70:30 joint venture in the business of operating a theme park, education centres, nursery centres, food and beverage operations and merchandising operations in Malaysia. PCSB is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parkson Retail Asia Ltd, which is in turn a 67.61%-owned unit of Parkson Holdings. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, Parkson said Studio Kingdoms will manage the JV company, which will be named Parkson Edutainment World Sdn Bhd. \\u201cThe initial project of the JV shall be situated in Maju Junction Mall, Kuala Lumpur, and shall involve a total investment of approximately RM11 million,\\u201d the filing read. \\u201cIn addition to the initial paid-up capital of RM1 million, both PCSB and SKN will provide the JV company [with] an interest-free shareholders\\u2019 loan of up to RM7.8 million and up to RM2.2 million respectively,\\u201d it added. PCSB\\u2019s initial paid up capital will be sourced from internally-generated funds, the filing stated. Parkson (fundamental: 1.8; valuation: 1.7) said any further funding requirements will be fulfilled by shareholders\\u2019 loans or external bank borrowings. Under the JV, the theme park will operate within shopping malls in Malaysia, and feature 35 \\u201cHappy Toon World\\u201d characters from the US.

Both marine \\u2014 from higher value for vessels repaired \\u2014 and offshore segments contributed to the higher revenue.

Securing a charter for Sovereign within a short window despite being served an early termination notice is positive for Perdana Petroleum. It reflects a demand for brownfield-supporting vessels (work boats, accommodation work barges). For that, we expect Odyssey to secure a charter soon. The cut in our 2015 net profit forecast by 20% mainly reflects lower earnings from Sovereign/Odyssey on lower operating days (a decline of 50% or 26%) to 180/270 days.

In the earlier half of this period, local institutional fund buying lifted prices, as they have for much of this year. Notably though, foreign buying provided the boost in the later half. Some of the biggest gainers were index-linked stocks such as Petronas Chemicals, PPB Group, IHH Healthcare, CIMB, RHB Capital, YTL Corp and Genting. Retail investors, by and large, remained on the sidelines. It is unclear if the recent inflow of foreign funds is sustainable or just a blip in the broader downtrend. Malaysia has seen the largest net outflows so far this year, compared to our neighbours, weighed down largely by domestic issues. In fact, Indonesia and the Philippines enjoyed net inflows while Thailand saw comparatively mild net selling. Regional markets were broadly higher last week, due, in part, to the US Federal Reserve\\u2019s statement, which pared projections on the pace of interest rate hikes. As a result, monies have resumed their flow to emerging markets, where average valuations are also lower compared with US stocks. In line with this, the US dollar gave up some of its gains. The ringgit traded slightly stronger against the greenback, now at around 3.685 from as low as 3.73 at the end of the previous week. The weaker dollar lent strength to commodities. Oil prices rose further after Saudi Arabia initiated military operations in Yemen, fanning concerns that the conflict will spread and threaten the flow of supply. But gains were tempered by prevailing supply glut. Brent crude futures are hovering around US$58 per barrel, at the point of writing. \\u00a0 Shares in my portfolio did well last week amid improvement sentiment for the broader market. Total value for my portfolio was up 0.98%, outpacing the 0.54% gain for the FBM KLCI. Last week\\u2019s gains boosted the portfolio\\u2019s total returns, since inception, to roughly 7.8%. I continue to outperform the benchmark index, which has fallen by 0.9% over the same period. My latest acquisition, Lii Hen (Fundamental score: 2.5/3, Valuation score 2.4/3) did well enough. The stock traded as high as RM4.14 before closing at RM4.04 last Friday. Notably, Oceancash (Fundamental score: 1.4/3, Valuation score 0.6/3) gained 12.7% on renewed investor interest.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 I kept the portfolio, now 56% invested, unchanged. I am still cautious on the market\\u2019s outlook, despite the benchmark index\\u2019s recent gains. There remain many unresolved domestic uncertainties that had resulted in hefty foreign fund selling and sharp fall in the ringgit thus far. Come April 1, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be implemented. Prospects for corporate earnings growth remains muted. The impact of rising costs on consumer spending may not be fully reflected in prevailing projections. A ratings downgrade by Fitch, though the smallest of the three global rating agencies, if it comes to pass will further weigh on investor confidence.

Muhibbah's (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 0.8) tender book stood at about RM4 billion, while its order book was slightly over RM2 billion as at February this year, she said. On whether Muhibbah will tender for new jobs for Petronas' Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex, Lee said the firm may consider doing so on a selective basis. \"We see how it goes because we are pretty busy. We have to be selective. We can't take on every job,\" she said. Lee foresees that for the next seven to 10 years, Malaysia will experience an enormous growth in infrastructure jobs whether in the oil and gas, marine or onshore segments. She pointed out that international contractors have been seeking business opportunities in Malaysia, and thus, investors should closely watch the construction industry.

However, Icon Offshore, in a statement to Bursa Malaysia yesterday, said it is not aware of the \\u201cdetails of the nature of the investigations or their status\\u201d. The company said it is committed to upholding the company\\u2019s corporate values that promote integrity throughout the entire company. Icon Offshore also said it has a code of conduct that places a high priority on upholding high ethical standards. \\u201cThe board takes serious exception to any breaches in policies and integrity, and will not hesitate to take appropriate actions if necessary. We will continue to monitor the situation and any material development shall be announced,\\u201d it said. Jamal, who is Rahman\\u2019s younger brother, ceased to be a substantial shareholder of Icon Offshore on March 9, according to filings with Bursa. However, the statements did not indicate his equity interest after selling one million shares or a 0.08% stake on that date. He has continued to pare down his stake after that, selling some 6.2 million shares or a 0.53% stake from March 10 until April 21. Prior to his cessation as a substantial shareholder, Bloomberg data showed that Jamal\\u2019s reported shareholding in Icon stood at 5.02% with 59.08 million shares, while Rahman had a 1.24% stake or over 14.61 million shares. Ekuiti Nasional Bhd (Ekuinas) had a 42.28% stake or 497.76 million shares in the company as at August last year. Jamal has over 17 years of experience in the offshore supply vessel (OSV) industry. He is the president of the Malaysia Offshore Support Vessels Owners\\u2019 Association, a position he has held since April 2013. Prior to his venture into the oil and gas sector, the 48-year old was a practising dentist for almost 10 years. Rahman, 54, is a marine engineer by profession. He has over 32 years of experience in the marine transport and shipbuilding industry, including a senior manager position he held in MISC Bhd until 2006. According to Icon Offshore\\u2019s website, Rahman is responsible for the group\\u2019s entire fleet operations, both shore-based and shipboard. In addition, he oversees the implementation of the group\\u2019s health, safety and environment (HSE), and security policies and procedures. Icon Offshore is the OSV unit of Ekuinas which was listed in mid-2014. Icon Offshore\\u2019s initial public offering raised about RM944.92 million \\u2014 RM534.69 million of it was accrued to the selling shareholders through the offer for sale of up to 289.02 million shares, while the public issue of up to 221.75 million shares raised RM410.23 million. Most of the RM410.23 million was slated to be used for the expansion of its vessel fleet within 24 months and repayment of bank borrowings within 12 months. Icon Offshore is Malaysia\\u2019s largest pure play OSV provider with a fleet of 32 vessels, Jamal said during the launch of the company prospectus last year. He also said the management intended to up the fleet size to 39 vessels by the end of this year. In February, Icon Offshore clinched six out of the eight packages being offered by Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd under the latter\\u2019s umbrella contract for the provision of spot charter marine vessels.

The index reached a high of 1,856.51 points last Tuesday, before retreating to close at 1,844.31 points on Friday. Hurt by the weak ringgit and low oil prices, the FBM KLCI\\u2019s decline towards the end of 2014 had wiped out considerable gains from the year\\u2019s high, which had briefly exceeded 1,890 points in July when the market had begun to look overvalued. This year, the local bellwether has gained more than 5% to date. Meanwhile, its regional peers, the Hang Seng Index and Nikkei 225, have each gained over 14%. At current levels, which is almost back to last year\\u2019s high, fund managers and analysts are mixed about the local stock market\\u2019s valuations \\u2014 some say it is still overvalued, while others say there is still upside potential. Pacific Mutual Fund Bhd chief investment officer Koh Huat Soon believes that at the current price-earnings ratio (PER) of 16 times, the FBM KLCI is overvalued as it is trading above the historical average. According to him, the expensive valuation is mainly supported by government-linked domestic funds. \\u201cThe government faces tremendous challenges in meeting budget targets as we are not out of the woods yet in terms of the impact of cheap oil prices on the budget and current account. This makes Malaysia vulnerable to a credit rating downgrade,\\u201d he tells The Edge. As it is, Fitch Ratings last month said Malaysia\\u2019s credit rating is \\u201cmore than 50% likely\\u201d to be downgraded on a worsening trade balance and the inability of state investment fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) to meet its debt obligations. Pacific Mutual expects the FBM KLCI to reach 1,817 points by year-end, 1.6% lower than its current level. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t see much upside. With headwinds before us \\u2014 namely the challenges of meeting budget targets, shrinking current account surplus, heightened political risks and threat of a rating downgrade \\u2014 it is difficult to justify paying above-mean valuation for this market at the moment,\\u201d Koh explains. On the contrary, Danny Wong, chief executive of Areca Capital Sdn Bhd, believes that factors such as weak oil prices, the impact of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the possibility of a rating downgrade have largely been priced in. \\u201cI think many have priced in the negative factors. Some foreign funds may return due to our economic growth and continued Economic Transformation Programme initiatives, especially our subsidy reforms. What we need is to overcome the bearish ringgit issues,\\u201d Wong tells The Edge. The ringgit has plunged more than 18% against the greenback since August last year, hitting a low of 3.73 on March 20, 2015. It is currently hovering around 3.66. Wong says the FBM KLCI and Malaysian stocks in general deserve a premium over their peers due to their defensive nature and high dividend yields. Over at Etiqa Insurance and Takaful, head of research Chris Eng says the FBM KLCI is \\u201cnot yet overvalued\\u201d. However, the market is expected to continue seeing some volatility, and Etiqa is forecasting a broad range of 1,828 to 1,870 points for the year. The following are some FBM KLCI component stocks on the radar screen of the investment community that may be worth a look. Tenaga Nasional Bhd \\u201cOn Tenaga, we continue to see relatively low coal prices and increasing market share as the company completes its Manjung 4 [coal-fired] power plant and hydro dams,\\u201d says Eng. Manjung 4 recently missed its end-March commercial operation date and is expected to be delayed for another two to four weeks. But TA Securities\\u2019 James Ratnam says the delay is not expected to have any operational impact on Tenaga (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.8) given the short delay and 30% reserve margin. \\u201cTenaga\\u2019s unit fuel cost is expected to fall as it increases the use of coal \\u2014 a cheaper alternative to gas \\u2014 in the coming quarters as Manjung 4 comes on stream,\\u201d says Pacific Mutual\\u2019s Koh. \\u201cLower generation cost would present an opportunity for the subsidy on liquefied natural gas to be reduced without an adverse impact on tariff during the next review.\\u201d Tenaga has also just received 90.21% acceptance for its offer to take over Integrax Bhd, a strategic move that will ensure the latter focuses on its coal handling services to Tenaga\\u2019s Janamanjung power plant complex. Including the 1,000mw Manjung 5, the complex will have a total capacity of 4,000mw \\u2014 16% of Peninsular Malaysia\\u2019s capacity. TA raised its target price on Tenaga to RM16.29 from RM16.25, and has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the stock. Tenaga closed at RM14.50 last Friday with a PER of over 11 times \\u2014 still cheap, according to Etiqa\\u2019s Eng. \\u201cAs it is, Tenaga trades on a calendar 2016 PER of just 12 times against the market\\u2019s FBM100 PER of 15 times. Tenaga deserves to be re-rated to at least parity with the market,\\u201d says Koh. RHB Capital Bhd A catalyst to watch for in RHB Cap is a possible internal reorganisation of the group, whereby RHB Bank will take over RHB Cap\\u2019s listing status and house all its entities. The exercise, which could include a rights issue, is expected to improve the group\\u2019s tax efficiency, although details are not yet clear. \\u201cOn RHB Cap, plans to restructure the bank and the return of foreign interest (to the FBM KLCI) should help boost the company, which also has a new CEO,\\u201d says Eng. On March 5, RHB Cap (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 2.1) announced that group CEO Kellee Kam had resigned from his position. This will take effect in May. The group has identified a successor and is awaiting Bank Negara Malaysia\\u2019s approval. Some quarters do not expect the banking sector to see exciting prospects in the near term. That said, RHB Cap\\u2019s valuations may still be a selling point at this time. \\u201cBank stocks are not currently overvalued. They are good as defensive and dividend-yielding stocks,\\u201d says Edmund Tham, head of research at Mercury Securities Sdn Bhd. \\u201cConsumer loan growth may be slower due to the GST, which may affect sentiment, and Bank Negara guidelines [which may result in] low approval rates. But corporate banking, trade finance and investment banking will still be growing,\\u201d he adds. Where RHB Cap is concerned, its 12 months trailing PER is just under 11 times \\u2014 compared with Public Bank Bhd\\u2019s 16 times and Malayan Banking Bhd\\u2019s 13 times \\u2014 and it has a dividend yield of 1.96%. Public Bank In a banking sector that is experiencing a slowdown in growth and an increase in non-performing loans, Public Bank (fundamental: 2.8; valuation: 1.5) has largely bucked the trend. The banking group outperformed its peers by a large margin in numerous valuation metrics, and its position as a favoured stock among fund managers could point to further upside. \\u201cPublic Bank\\u2019s share price is expensive but investors are willing to pay a premium because it is perceived as a defensive pick. The stock carries a large weight in the composite index, so it has to be reflected in a fund manager\\u2019s portfolio,\\u201d says Koh. Compared with its banking peers, Public Bank was a top performer for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2014. Return on equity stood at 19.9% compared with the industry average of 13%. Its loan growth saw a 10.8% increase on a year-on-year basis, also outperforming the industry average of 8.7%. In a March 25 note, Affin Hwang Capital Research says it expects the banking group to continue the outperformance this year, pegging a target price of RM21.80 to the stock. \\u201cThe group has the lowest gross impaired loan ratio (of 0.65%), the number one position in franchise retail banking and a well-capitalised balance sheet,\\u201d it says. MISC Bhd Ever since the failed takeover bid by national oil firm Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) in 2013, MISC\\u2019s (fundamental: 2; valuation: 1) share price has appreciated by leaps and bounds. The stock gained 24% this year as at April 10, making it one of the best-performing stocks among the 30 constituents in the FBM KLCI. Being one of the few niche industry stocks on the component index, MISC is influenced by external factors in the shipping sector. With the prevailing low oil price environment prompting companies to store their oil inventory, crude tanker rates have seen a resurgence, thanks to the uptick in demand. A lifting of sanctions on Iranian oil production is also set to offset the delivery of newbuild ships, ensuring that tanker demand outpaces supply. \\u201cBoth factors are significant re-rating catalysts for MISC. In a prolonged situation of cheap oil, the demand for storage will continue to grow if the oil oversupply continues. Current crude tanker rates are already at multi-year highs, which is indicative of a longer-term trend,\\u201d says an analyst of a bank-backed research house, who has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d rating on MISC. \\u00a0 This article first appeared in Capital, The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on April 13 - 19, 2015."}, "553": {"date_posted": "21/4/2015", "title": "MISC rises 22 sen on asset disposal speculation", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Apr 21): MISC Bhd rose as much as 22 sen or 2.45% to RM9.21 on reports speculating the shipping firm may sell its loss-making tanker unit to Canada-based Teekay Tankers Ltd.

On KLCC Prop\\u2019s Lot D1, Hashim said the group has yet to secure an anchor tenant for the development. \\u201cThe management has been striving to get an anchor tenant, because, as you know, we are not a speculative developer.

We\\u2019ve been working very hard with InvestMalaysia and InvestKL to bring in MNCs (multinational corporations), but to date, we have not been successful,\\u201d said Hashim. On why KLCC Prop has not been able to secure an anchor tenant, Hashim said it is mainly due to tenants not having enough capacity to occupy the 800,000 sq ft allocated. As for the new mixed development to be constructed near the Dayabumi Complex, he said the demolition of the City Point shopping centre at the project site has already commenced. The development will comprise 500,000 sq ft of office space, a hotel and a service retail element. It is to be completed in 2019. \\u201cBasically, we are looking at another development which is equivalent to the Menara 3 Petronas project,\\u201d Hashim said.

PetDag (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 1.1) is expected to fund its capex via internal cash balance, which leaped five times to RM1.84 billion currently from RM358.63 million in 2013, following the implementation of the managed float system by the government in December last year. The system was introduced to determine the price of both petrol and diesel, based on the monthly average of world crude oil price. The capex is seen as important to improve its profit margin amid the falling oil prices. Petronas CEO and PetDag chairman Datuk Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin also denied a report yesterday that said Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd, the exploration and production arm of Petronas, had issued an internal memo asking its staff to take a 20% pay cut due to low oil prices. \\u201cIt is misreporting. There is no salary cut for Petronas staff, including Petronas Carigali, and there will be no retrenchment of Petronas staff,\\u201d he said. In a statement, Petronas clarified that Petronas Carigali had distributed a memo to five management service contractors (MSCs) that provide professional manpower to Petronas. \\u201cDue to current market conditions, Petronas, as with all oil and gas players globally, has initiated cost-cutting measures among contractors and vendors. The salary reduction of 20% in the [media] report affects 170 professionals hired by MSCs. It does not involve Petronas employees,\\u201d the statement read. Meanwhile, Mohd Ibrahimnuddin said PetDag sees opportunities to increase its profit margin in the aviation fuel segment, mainly due to the implementation of the Asean Open Skies policy and the opening of klia2, which saw an increase in jet fuel demand and passenger traffic. \\u201cOverall, the aviation segment contributes about half the total commercial sales or some 10% to our overall margin. The commercial division contributed 51.4% to our revenue last year. We see the expected growth of 3% in passenger traffic to 85.3 million this year to spur demand in this division,\\u201d he said. Currently, PetDag has 13 aviation terminals nationwide. On retail products, Mohd Ibrahimnuddin expects sales to increase with the opening of some 20 gas stations this year. Currently, the company has 1,057 stations nationwide. PetDag\\u2019s sales of retail products \\u2014 petrol and diesel \\u2014 dropped 1.9% to 7.1 billion litres in 2014 from 7.2 billion litres in 2013, dragged by the disruption of its operations in the East Coast due to floods in the fourth quarter of last year, heightened enforcement activities, and the delay in opening of new petrol stations. Analysts estimated that a 1% drop in sales will trim PetDag\\u2019s net profit by RM5 million. Mohd Ibrahimnuddin expects the liquefied petroleum gas and lubricant business overseas to benefit from deregulation, particularly in Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. \\u201cCurrently, overseas business contributes less than 3% to the overall revenue. In the long run, we expect the contribution to increase to 10%. It will take time,\\u201d he noted.

We have worked on a design and it is acceptable by Petronas (Petroliam Nasional Bhd),\\u201d he told a press conference after the company\\u2019s annual general meeting yesterday. When asked about the prospects for its fabrication segment that caters mainly to the oil and gas industry, Ahmad Ramli said there are still fabrication works for grabs, despite a slowdown in the sector. According to BHIC executive director David Berry, there are some replenishment to be done on certain existing offshore sites. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not just for new build on new site, some of the old sites are at a point where they need some refurbishments or replacements. What the oil majors have done is cut down on new spend for capital expenditure but they don\\u2019t necessarily want to cut back on existing production,\\u201d said Berry. Ahmad Ramli noted that Petronas has a few fabrication-related tenders in the pipeline and BHIC is actively pursuing these contracts. Meanwhile, he highlighted that BHIC\\u2019s current focus now is on its military shipbuilding capabilities as the company had a bitter experience in commercial shipbuilding in 2008. \\u201cBut we can\\u2019t completely ignore commercial. \\u201cWe are smarter now.

For the FSO business, EA Technique has a vessel, MT Nautika Muar, operating in the Kayu Manis Oilfield in Bintulu, Sarawak, with three years remaining on the charter contract. The group\\u2019s second FSO vessel, MT Fois Nautika Tembikai, is slated for delivery this April to the Tembikai Oilfield in Terengganu under a six-year charter contract. An FSO vessel is a tanker-based vessel that functions as a semi-permanent offshore storage facility for oil and gas. \\u201cFSO vessels will become our main revenue earner this year, next year and in the future. One FSO vessel can bring in about RM10 million a year in pre-tax profit,\\u201d Abdul Hak tells The Edge. He holds an 18% stake in the group while Sindora Bhd, a unit of Kulim (M) Bhd, is the major shareholder with a 50.6% stake. EA Technique reported revenue of RM155.66 million in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2014 (FY2014), with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) and net profit of RM59.28 million and RM14.63 million respectively. It was listed on the Main Board of Bursa Malaysia in December 2014. While EA Technique\\u2019s second FSO vessel will boost revenue in this segment, the group had also last month secured an engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning (EPCIC) contract for an FSO vessel for a full field development project in the North Malay Basin. Based on the group\\u2019s filing with Bursa, the EPCIC contract will expire in August 2016 and is worth US$191.8 million (RM701.7 million at the time of writing). Abdul Hak says the contract was awarded by Hess Exploration & Production Malaysia BV, a vehicle of Hess Corp in the North Malay Basin production sharing contract with Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas). Hess Corp said last month that it will cut its capital and exploratory budget by 16% to US$4.7 billion due to the fall in crude oil prices. However, it will continue to fund the development in the North Malay Basin. Petronas too has said that it will cut its capital expenditure by between 15% and 20% this year. But so far, EA Technique has not felt the impact of this. \\u201cPetronas might put some marginal oilfields on hold, but not those that have already taken off. For us, our Tembikai FSO, [Petronas is] going ahead because that is already almost ready. At the moment, we are not affected,\\u201d says Abdul Hak. That said, EA Technique does not expect to take up anymore FSO jobs this year as it does not have the capacity to do so. The group seems to have timed its projects well as contract flow, amid the poor oil price climate, is expected to be slow for this year at least. Having fallen more than 50% to below US$50 per barrel since August last year, Brent crude oil prices are now trading just above US$60 per barrel. Abdul Hak expects crude oil prices to hover at US$70 to US$80 per barrel this year. As EA Technique\\u2019s FSO contract flow may slow, the group is focusing more on its port operations. It provides vessels, mooring gangs and harbour tugboats, ranging from 30 to 60 tonne bollard pull. \\u201cOur share [of the Malaysian market] is about 20% to 25% now. So we are looking at 35% to 40% of the market in three to four years,\\u201d says Abdul Hak. He adds that the local market has over 100 tugboats, but many of them are owned by foreign companies. According to its website, EA Technique has 15 vessels under its port operations. It is building nine tugboats at the moment, with one to be delivered each month up to the end of the year. \\u201cWe are looking at another 10 to 12 new tugboats for the Malaysian market. That is a capital expenditure of more than RM200 million over the next three years,\\u201d says Abdul Hak. If EA Technique meets this target, its port operations will contribute over 30% to total group revenue. \\u201cWe want to balance our revenue stream,\\u201d Abdul Hak says, adding that port operations are less risky and offer the company a 15% margin. For FY2014, port operations contributed 26% to the group\\u2019s revenue, while 74% came from marine transport and offshore storage operations (including FSO vessels, offshore support vessels, liquefied petroleum gas tankers and product tankers, which contribute equal parts to the segment at present). EA Technique\\u2019s revenue in FY2014 rose 28.5% year on year to RM155.66 million, but net profit fell 74% to RM14.63 million. Profit had fallen due to a high base in FY2013 where it made a RM37.5 million gain on disposal of an associate company and received a RM2.9 million share of profit from an associate. Stripping out these gains, EA Technique\\u2019s net profit fell a marginal 11.5% from RM16.5 million in FY2013. The group\\u2019s net assets per share stands at 54 sen. This seems to be fairly reflected in its share price, which closed at 54.5 sen last Thursday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM272.16 million. The stock has fallen some 16% since it listed at 65 sen in December 2014. RHB Research has not rated EA Technique but values the stock at 75 sen, indicating a 37% upside from the current level.

That said, the prevailing low crude oil price environment has made times challenging for those in the O&G vessel space, and charter rates have been compressed. \\u201cPetronas (Petroliam Nasional Bhd) is renegotiating the price of current contracts of vessels, so charter rates are coming down. For new contracts, charter rates might not be good at this moment,\\u201d said Rahman. \\u201cBut I like the [vessel] business. Even though Petronas is cutting down operating and capital expenditure, services and maintenance have to go on,\\u201d he said, adding that this is one area with potential for the group. Tanjung Offshore (fundamental: 1.85; valuation: 0.6) has been without a core business since 2012 when it sold off its offshore support vessel (OSV) business to Ekuiti Nasional Bhd. The company has been busy restructuring and selling off non-profitable ventures since, and this, Rahman said, has reduced its overheads by 70% and also put it in a good cash position. Cash and bank balances as at end-2014 stood at RM40.9 million, compared with RM32.8 million in December 2012. Net assets have reduced a marginal two sen or 3.78% per share to 51 sen per share against 53 sen in 2012. The company\\u2019s earnings have been squeezed recently due to declining revenue. Net profit for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2014 (FY14) came in at RM1.06 million compared with RM10.9 million in FY13.\\u00a0 Revenue was down 67.2% to RM107.4 million in FY14 from RM327.8 million, due to the completion of various engineering equipment packages in FY13.\\u00a0 Rahman, who was appointed as CEO last month, is stepping in at a difficult time. Even before the disposal of its core business to Ekuinas, Tanjung Offshore was bleeding red. It incurred losses of RM55.4 million in FY11 (mainly due to operational losses and impairment of receivables of its engineering equipment division) and RM11.6 million in FY12 (mainly due to one-off losses from closure/winding up of subsidiaries). In December last year, its hopes for a new OSV business were dashed when a planned reverse takeover of its business by Paris-based O&G vessel giant Bourbon SA fell through. It has since been battling internal accusations of breach of fiduciary duty, among other things, which has resulted in two of its directors \\u2014 Tan Sri Tan Kean Soon and Muhammad Sabri Ab Ghani \\u2014 together with paid adviser Datuk Harzani Azmi being suspended of their executive and adviser roles, following the recommendations of an independent committee. The committee, formed on Jan 8, 2015 by Tanjung Offshore to conduct an internal review following speculative media reports on the company, is now conducting further investigations into the trio\\u2019s alleged wrongdoings. Following his suspension, Tan, together with two others acting in concert, had filed to remove three directors \\u2014 George William Warren Jr, Datuk Ab Wahab Ibrahim and Shahrizal Hisham Abdul Halim \\u2014 from the board. The three are coincidentally members of the same independent committee that recommended the suspension of Tan, Muhammad Sabri and Harzani. The extraordinary general meeting to vote on the removal of the three directors is slated for March 27, 2015.

The rating incorporates a one-notch uplift from MHB\\u2019s standalone rating based on MARC\\u2019s assessment on the likelihood of moderate support from MHB\\u2019s ultimate parent Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas). The support assessment has taken into consideration the business linkages between the two entities and Petronas\\u2019 strong representation on MHB\\u2019s board of directors. Petronas\\u2019 interest in the group is via its 62.4%-owned subsidiary MISC Bhd \\u00a0(fundamental: 2; valuation: 1), which in turn has a 66.5% interest in MHB (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 1.8). In a statement today, MARC noted that since its initial assessment in February last year, MHB\\u2019s standalone profile has weakened, mainly due to a declining order book and weakening margins arising from competitive pressures in the offshore engineering works sector. MHB\\u2019s order book of RM1.6 billion as at end-2014 provides earnings visibility until the first quarter of 2016. \"We view the group\\u2019s (MHB's) ability to restore its order book to healthier levels over the near term to be challenging in light of weakened prospects for the upstream oil and gas sector following the sharp plunge in crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2014,\" the rating agency said. \"Oil majors, including Petronas, have reduced capex or deferred/canceled projects, translating into weak order book replenishments for offshore oil and gas fabrication services providers. Nonetheless, MHB could secure contracts from Petronas given that the national oil company is still expected to spend RM54 billion in 2015, from an earlier forecast of RM60 billion. \"MHB\\u2019s strong domestic position in fabrication would underpin its ability to compete under Petronas\\u2019 policy of awarding contracts on a competitive basis,\" added MARC. MHB is currently undertaking the Malikai TLP and SK316 projects for Sabah Shell Petroleum Co Ltd and Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd respectively; these projects account for about 63% of the total order book and are expected to be completed by end-2015 and first quarter of 2016 respectively. MARC also noted that MHB\\u2019s major capital expenditure (capex) programme remains its yard optimisation programme, which commenced in 2006, for which MHB has spent RM1.1 billion of the budgeted RM2.5 billion. \"While MHB has utilised internal funds and proceeds from its initial public offering listing in 2011 to fund its capex programme to date, part of the proceeds from the proposed sukuk issuance will be earmarked to meet its requirement of about RM233 million for FY15,\" it added. Should MHB fully draw down under the sukuk programme, its pro forma debt-to-equity ratio would rise from a low 0.1 times as at end-FY2014 to a manageable 0.5 times. Nevertheless, MARC said downward pressure on MHB\\u2019s standalone rating could emerge if the group is unable to replenish its order book to a level that would prevent its financial metrics from weakening. \"Any deterioration in its financial performance over the near term could also trigger an outlook revision and/or downward rating migration,\" it said. MHB shares closed down 1.65% to close at RM1.19 today, bringing a market capitalisation of RM1.94 billion.

One is the US dollar appreciation against the ringgit. Another is the fact that all exports will be exempted from the 6% goods and services tax come April,\\u201d he said. The ACE Market-listed company is targeting to post a revenue of RM43 million for FY15, a 20% increase from the RM35.91 million recorded in FY14. SEHB (fundamental: 2.5; valuation: 2.4) saw its net profit for FY14 grow 409.9% to RM3.8 million from RM745,000 in FY13, on the back of strong investments in engineering training made by the oil and gas (O&G) industry and contributions from its overseas counterparts. \\u201cThe training investments in O&G will be significant for the next five years, which is why we foresee growth in our revenue,\\u201d said Lim. Revenue contribution from its lubrication production arm, Solution Biogen Sdn Bhd, is also expected to double in FY15 as it relocates its production facilities to a new plant in Bukit Kemuning, Shah Alam from Puchong. \\u201cWith the new facilities, we are able to increase production of these lubricants and our sales revenue is expected to grow very significantly this year,\\u201d said Lim. Solution Biogen contributed RM1.8 million or 5% to the group\\u2019s revenue for FY14. Solution Biogen produces green lubricant base oils for industrial, automotive and household purposes. In addition to its plant in Bukit Kemuning, the group is also planning to build another plant in Bukit Jalil Technology Park, Kuala Lumpur. Its executive director Lim Chiou Kim said the facility will be ready by 2017 and will be built on a piece of leasehold land, which the group had secured from Technology Park Malaysia Sdn Bhd. She added that the facility would boost the group\\u2019s production of engineering equipment by 50%. Nevertheless, the bulk of the group\\u2019s revenue still comes from the domestic market, with the largest of its foreign markets being the Middle East. \\u201cWe supply to about 95% of the local technical colleges. Our biggest client locally is University Teknologi Petronas,\\u201d he said. Lim also said SEHB is in the midst of acquiring two companies to boost its education niche, but declined to name them except to say that one is local and the other foreign. \\u201cOur core business is still in training. So we will acquire targets in the similar industry. We\\u2019re currently looking at targets which have niches in the electrical and software expertise. This is complementary to our current product range,\\u201d he said. Today, SEHB is one of the top 10 producers of engineering solutions for universities worldwide. \\u201cAbout 90% of the technical colleges in Malaysia are our customers and we are the market leader in terms of education equipment supplies locally. Our major competitors are from Europe, the UK and Germany,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe focus on a niche segment, but this is good as we don\\u2019t have to deal with too many competitors.\\u201d Going forward, Lim said the group plans to expand into the North and South America markets.

According to president Ng Say Teck, the company generated revenue of RM120 million in FY2014, up 7% from FY2013. Acknowledging that 5% revenue growth is not an ambitious goal, he says it is realistic for the group, given the market uncertainties caused by falling oil prices. \\u201cThe slower growth in FY2015 will be due to a slowdown in the property market, a pullback in capital expenditure due to a collapse in oil prices and the scaling down of expansion plans by industry players,\\u201d Ng tells The Edge. Established in1968, NS BlueScope Lysaght Malaysia is a pioneer in the manufacture of steel-making products in the country. Its product range includes roofing and walling, roof trusses and building structures. The company is a 60:40 joint venture between NS BlueScope Lysaght Singapore Pte Ltd and Singapore-listed United Engineers Ltd (UEL). To recap, BlueScope Lysaght (M) Sdn Bhd was incorporated in Malaysia in 1968 and was initially known as John Lysaght. The company was renamed NS\\u00a0BlueScope Lysaght Malaysia in 2012 after Nippon Steel Sumitomo Metal Corp of Japan came into the picture as a joint-venture partner. There is no connection between NS BlueScope Lysaght Malaysia and public listed Lysaght Galvanized Steel Bhd (LGS). However, it is worth noting that UEL is a common shareholder of NS BlueScope Lysaght Malaysia and LGS as the Singapore company has an 11.63% stake in Lysaght (M) Sdn Bhd, the controlling shareholder of LGS with a 55.14% stake. NS BlueScope Lysaght Malaysia has manufacturing operations in Kota Kinabalu, Bintulu, Kuching and Shah Alam with a combined capacity to produce close to 20,000 tonnes per annum of roofing and walling materials. \\u201cAt the moment, we have adequate production capacity for our existing product range. Plans are underway to invest in capacity to manufacture new innovative products in the coming financial years,\\u201d says Ng, adding that the company will allocate 2% to 3% of its revenue to R&D every year. He also highlights the government\\u2019s announcement in the revised Budget 2015 that the development expenditure of RM48.5 billion for the year will be maintained and spent. NS BlueScope Lysaght Malaysia is expected to benefit from the spillovers from mega-infrastructure projects, such as the mass rapid transit (MRT), light rail transit (LRT) extension and West Coast Expressway. Meanwhile, the weakening ringgit should boost the export activities of local manufacturers. Thus, NS BlueScope Lysaght Malaysia, which also serves clients in the industrial sector, will be able to supply more products. \\u201cLocal exporters are expected to undertake factory expansion, which means rising demand for our products,\\u201d says Ng. The company\\u2019s roofing and walling segment contributes about 80% to revenue while the remaining 20% comes from structural products. Ng says traditionally, residential projects use mainly concrete or clay tiles, but the use of metal roofing is gaining traction, especially in the medium to high-end developments with contemporary designs, such as lower pitch roofs that is possible only with metal roofing. \\u201cWe are well known in the project market as our clients are mainly construction firms and property developers.\\u201d NS BlueScope Lysaght Malaysia was involved in some of the country\\u2019s landmark projects, such as the Petronas Twin Towers, the Kuching Airport, LRT Phase 2, Curtin University, Hershey\\u2019s confectionery plant and the National Cancer Institute. \\u201cOur differentiation comes from fully tested product performance and stringent quality control and procedures, offering total peace of mind to loyal global clientele, such as Coca-Cola, Toyota and Nestl\\u00e9,\\u201d Ng says. Moving forward, NS BlueScope Lysaght Malaysia will be seeking growth in the retail market by launching new products as it expects a weak consumer spending pattern and slowdown in the building industry. \\u201cIn the next two to three years, we want to explore the retail market, which, in our view, is a potential growth area. We want to provide a one-stop centre for roofing solutions to end-users,\\u201d Ng comments. He believes with an enhanced service-based and total solution philosophy, coupled with a strategic alliance with Nippon Steel and access to the capacity and resources of sister companies in the region, NS BlueScope Lysaght Malaysia will continue to stay relevant to its customers.

But on the back of several high-profile layoffs late last year and early this year, 2015 might not be such a good year. Consumer sentiment is cautious, the property market is softening, interest rates are up, the stock market is down and the economic outlook as a whole simply isn\\u2019t as bullish. And when businesses lose confidence, salaries and hiring tend to slow down too. In such an environment, what can Malaysian workers expect from the job market this year? A good year actually, but only if you are a skilled professional in the mid-to-top level of your field, say the country\\u2019s top recruiters. \\u201cWe genuinely do not see any evidence of a slowdown at all for the skilled workforce from the mid to senior level, not even within oil and gas. The need for local skilled individuals is as high as ever,\\u201d says Hays Specialist Recruitment (Malaysia) Ltd country manager Tom Osborne. Osborne\\u2019s focus,however, is on the mid to high end of the job market where Hays operates. At the lower end, there has been a steady stream of news that has driven concern about a softening job market \\u2014 nothing that will see unemployment rise, but slower wage growth and possibly fewer opportunities. \\u201cCompared with 2014, more employers say they will be hiring less this year, while fewer employers say they will be hiring more this year. As a lead indicator, it suggests that confidence of the market is weaker, but that doesn\\u2019t mean it will be a bad year. 2014 was a very good year for us,\\u201d says JobStreet country manager Chook Yuh Yng. She points out that postings on the recruitment site have not shown any signs of slowing down in January. However, listings in March, the peak recruitment period, will be more telling of 2015\\u2019s outlook. JobStreet primarily covers white-collar recruitment ads from entry to mid-level positions. The company\\u2019s survey in late 2014 shows only 37% of managers plan to hire more staff this year, compared with 49% in 2014. At the same time, 24% of survey takers said they would be hiring less this year, compared with 14% in 2014 (see \\u201cEmployers planning to hire less\\u201d below). It doesn\\u2019t help that one of the country\\u2019s largest employers, Malaysian Airline System Bhd, is in the midst of trimming 6,000 staff from its 20,000 strong headcount. Even if most of the staff are reskilled and redeployed among other companies, it would still soak up a large number of vacancies. While one could argue that MAS\\u2019s layoffs could have been expected, it came as a surprise when Standard Chartered Bank announced the shutdown of its equities business in Asia resulting in 11% of its Malaysian workforce being laid off. Not long after, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd announced that it would be closing its Australian investment banking business. It may not be local, but the bank will have a number of Australia-based staff to redeploy locally. Adding to the concern, there has been talk in the market of voluntary separation schemes being undertaken in some of the big local banks. Strangely enough, financial services had been one of the most aggressive sectors in hiring last year. According to Chook, JobStreet saw a 27% increase in recruitment ads for positions in banking and financial services in 2014, making it the fastest growing sector in terms of recruitment. It is also the second largest sector by JobStreet recruitment ads (see \\u201cTop five job postings by industry\\u201d). \\u201cThere might be some slowdown at the investment banking and equities level, but that only makes a small portion of recruitment in financial services. Commercial and retail banking continues to do well, and there continues to be high demand for front office, revenue-generating positions,\\u201d says Sally Raj, managing director of Robert Walters Malaysia, a professional recruitment consultancy. \\u201cIt is not going to be a hunky-dory year. There is a lot of perceived negativity in the market and there are industries that will face a dip. But there is not going to be a complete downturn,\\u201d adds Sally. Meanwhile, the fall in crude oil prices to less than US$50 a barrel in the past few months also puts the oil and gas (O&G) sector in the limelight. Upstream operations that have on- going long-term supply contracts should not be substantially affected but the O&G service and support businesses are expecting a slowdown. After all, the country\\u2019s largest employer in the sector, Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas), plans to slash capital expenditure and operational expenditure by up to 15%, and between 25% and 30%, respectively, this year. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t cover the technical O&G, in relation to drilling engineers and rotation engineers. But based on the CVs that we have received, there are a lot of these people approaching us now for jobs. Their contracts have ended prematurely or their rates have come down,\\u201d notes Sally. Although he has observed some retrenchment in Malaysia, Hay\\u2019s Osborne maintains that the skills shortage in the industry remains, especially for highly specialised and senior roles. \\u201cThe downturn in oil prices does not have an immediate effect on salaries. However the longer the oil price stays low, the greater the impact will be on overall staffing demand, which will ultimately impact salaries as competition for jobs increases,\\u201d he adds. Nonetheless, Malaysian salaries remained relatively competitive in terms of increments, when compared with the region. According to a survey by Hays, 40% of Malaysians received an increment of more than 6% last year, compared with the 29% average across countries like China, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore. Looking ahead, even more employees are expected to get increments exceeding 6%. Forty-three per cent of Malaysian companies surveyed plan to hand out increments of more than 6%. In comparison, the average among countries surveyed was only 30% (see \\u201cSalary increases\\u201d below). Divergence within job market At the lower end of the job market however, JobStreet\\u2019s survey paints a slightly different picture, with less bonuses planned for this year as well as smaller than expected increments. The survey shows that employers only plan to reward about 31% of employees with a bonus of two months or more this year. In comparison, 35% of staff were rewarded with bonuses exceeding two months last year. Employees are also expecting bigger increments than employers are willing to give, notes Chook. According to the survey, employers are only planning to give 31% of staff an increment exceeding 6%. However, over 54% of employees are expecting such a raise. In a nutshell, it will continue to be an employees\\u2019 market for highly skilled professionals and specialists. Meanwhile, the lower end of the job market may see slower hiring and smaller increments. \\u201cThis is not unusual. It is something we see in many countries. Companies are willing to pay a high premium for skilled and experienced employees because there is a huge skills shortage,\\u201d says Hays managing director Christine Wright. \\u201cAs Malaysia\\u2019s economy grows and businesses grow, it creates new roles and increases vacancies. Businesses then need to compete for talent. It is a trend we have seen in other developing economies,\\u201d she explains. On the other hand, companies are not willing to pay a high price for candidates without experience, since the firms are basically paying for soft skills \\u2014 the candidates\\u2019 potential to develop, she adds. Nonetheless, graduates tend to have very high expectations, says Chook. \\u201cOn average, graduates\\u2019 pay is about RM2,100 a month. While this isn\\u2019t very high, it has been increasing over the years. However, the graduates on average are expecting to be paid RM3,500. This is a very large gap and it needs to be lowered,\\u201d she says. Poaching vs developing According to a Robert Walters report, employees can expect from 22% to as high as 30% increments when they change jobs, particularly those who have the right skills and experience. This is largely due to the shortage of talent to fill the ever-growing number of mid to high-level vacancies. So, what about candidates who lack the skills? At the moment, companies would rather pay cash for people with the right skills than invest the resources to develop these candidates themselves. However, as the skills gap continues to grow, this will change, says Wright. \\u201cCompanies need to invest in developing their employees to fill their vacancies and retain staff. Employees need to see an upward career trajectory and want to be part of a company that is growing,\\u201d she says. In fact, lack of career development is the main reason why three quarters of respondents were unhappy with their current jobs, according to the JobStreet survey. Only 45.6% of respondents see themselves staying with the company for less than one year while 36% would likely leave after three years. Lack of career growth was the main reason cited. Multinational companies are ahead of local businesses in people development, Osborne says, \\u201cI think that is recognised internally and within the local businesses. They are making strides to gear up to that level of standard. The candidates are aware of that as well.\\u201d If local companies divert more resources into developing talent instead of poaching it from rivals, it would certainly narrow the skills gap in the country, adds Wright. However, the government and industry would have to work closely with educational institutions to make sure the right skills are being developed for the workforce of the future. \\u201cCompanies will always want someone who can meet the job description, 10/10. But most of the time, the candidates are only a 6/10 or 7/10. The question is whether these candidates have the soft skills, the potential to be developed into a 10/10,\\u201d says Osborne. \\u201cMalaysians traditionally travel very well throughout the world. They are very diverse in their soft skills. When exposed to lots of different situations, when they need to use their soft skills, they do excel,\\u201d he adds.

Sources familiar with the company say the recently announced deal with Chinese party Zhiyuan Investment Group Co Ltd could have its merits. Perwaja (fundamental: 0.0, valuation: 0.0) announced last week that it had entered into a memorandum of agreement \\u201cto explore the possibility of Zhiyuan\\u2019s participation in Perwaja and/or via other business cooperation model to revive Perwaja\\u201d. Despite the positive news, many advise caution, and say that they will only believe that Zhiyuan will come in after the deal is inked. \\u201cAnything can happen until then. Only when they \\u2014 Perwaja and Zhiyuan \\u2014 both sign on the dotted line will I consider it a done deal,\\u201d says a market watcher. Zhiyuan\\u2019s plan involves utilising Perwaja\\u2019s plant in Kemaman to make specialised steel products for the China market, The Edge has learnt. This, it seems, can be done with minimal cost by the Chinese company. Perwaja\\u2019s announcement to the stock exchange indicates that Zhiyuan\\u2019s core business includes alloy manufacturing, which backs up the specialised steel story. According to industry sources, Perwaja\\u2019s plant already has a good asset base that includes two electric arc furnaces, which can be switched off when idle, and thus save costs. Blast furnaces, on the other hand, need to be in continuous operation. \\u201cThis could be the right fit for Perwaja. There is a lot of demand for specialised steel these days in China, but in Malaysia, there is very little demand,\\u201d the source adds. However, Perwaja isn\\u2019t the only steel miller that is trying to look for a Chinese partner. The Lion Group\\u2019s Megasteel Sdn Bhd has also been looking for a foreign investor for some time. However, Lion Group major shareholder Tan Sri William Cheng had been quoted as saying that the structure of the local steel industry posed hurdles to the entry of foreign players. He is of the view that the lack of protection for local millers has made the industry unattractive for foreign investors. It is noteworthy that the Chinese party will most likely end up controlling Perwaja after it injects funds into the company and helps revive it. Currently, the largest shareholder of Perwaja is Tan Sri Abu Sahid Mohamad who has 63.1% direct and indirect interest in the company. Kinsteel Bhd (fundamental: 0.0, valuation: 1.2), in which Abu Sahid has a 15.8% stake through his flagship Maju Holdings Sdn Bhd, holds a 31.2% stake in Perwaja. Tan Sri Pheng Yin Huah, via his vehicle Kinsteel, has an effective 32.4% equity interest in Perwaja. Pheng acquired a 51% stake in Perwaja in 2006 through Kinsteel at the peak of the steel cycle, and enjoyed a profitable run, buoyed by high steel prices, up until 2008. Sources say back then, Abu Sahid was deciding between Pheng, Tan Sri William Cheng\\u2019s Megasteel Sdn Bhd, and Tan Sri Quek Leng Chan of the Hong Leong group. Abu Sahid chose Pheng for various reasons, but principally because he saw that Pheng\\u2019s children were involved in the business, which augurs well for succession planning. However, soon after the global financial crisis, Perwaja faltered and its plant had to be shuttered after oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd and utility giant Tenaga Nasional Bhd halted gas and electricity supplies, and Perwaja was no longer able to pay its energy bills. \\u00a0\\u00a0As one shareholder puts it, \\u201cOur shares are worth nothing without the Chinese party\\u2019s intervention. All the former glory is lost.\\u201d Perwaja\\u2019s stock closed at 10 sen last Friday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM56 million. Since November 2013, Perwaja has been a Practice Note 17 company, a category for cash-strapped companies. For its first three months ended September last year, Perwaja suffered a net loss of RM44.9 million on RM1.8 million in sales. For the year ended June 2014, net losses amounted to RM1.2 billion. As at end-September last year, Perwaja had cash and bank balances of RM7. 5 million, while overdrafts and short-term borrowings totalled RM1.1 billion and long-term debt commitments came to RM276.4 million. The company\\u2019s finance costs for the three months ended September was a whopping RM18.9 million.\\u00a0 According to the sources, part of the restructuring at Perwaja involves banks taking a haircut as well. The proposed restructuring scheme entails secured creditors taking a 20% haircut on RM850 million worth of debts, and unsecured creditors taking a 50% haircut. The secured creditors include RHB Bank Bhd, OCBC Bank and Kuwait Finance House. Perwaja\\u2019s unsecured lenders include Petronas, which until end-2014, was owed more than RM275 million, while Tenaga was owed more than RM175 million in electricity bills. The Malaysian government has extended some RM200 million in soft loans, and other unsecured suppliers are owed about RM250 million. The creditors are basically caught between a rock and a hard place, as the only alternative to the proposal is the liquidation of assets, which would not fetch much, considering the specialised nature of the business.

While Wong declines to name the vendors of the site, a search by City & Country shows that the parcel is owned by KLK Development Sdn Bhd. The company is not related to Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd, a plantation company with a property development arm. Is the asking price too high? \\u201cIt\\u2019s not really expensive if you consider the fact that the last two transactions in the KLCC area were around RM3,300 psf \\u2026 We think the potential buyers will be those who don\\u2019t want to go through the hassle of getting the necessary planning approvals, which is the appeal of buying with the DO in the first place,\\u201d says Wong. In 2013, KSK Group Bhd bought 3.95 acres in Jalan Conlay from Singapore-based developer UOL Group Ltd for RM568 million or RM3,299 psf. The group\\u2019s unit, KSK Land Sdn Bhd, is currently developing over 1,000 luxury serviced residences and a hotel, both to be managed by Kempinski, atop a retail podium (see our Cover Story). Last May, Tropicana Corp Bhd sold 3.14 acres in Jalan Bukit Bintang to Offshore Triangle Sdn Bhd \\u2014 a company jointly owned by Tropicana and Hong Kong-listed developer Agile Property Holdings Ltd on a 30:70 basis \\u2014 for RM448.4 million cash or RM3,280 psf. The land is earmarked for a mixed-use development. Both parcels did not come with DOs. However, an industry observer says the two transactions took place within Kuala Lumpur city centre, whereas Jalan Raja Chulan falls on the fringe of the area. That said, the parcel is still in the Golden Triangle where opportunities to buy empty parcels are fairly uncommon, he says. It also comes with a DO and a decent plot ratio, he adds. Meanwhile, Henry Butcher Malaysia Sdn Bhd chief operating officer Tang Chee Meng says a notable transaction was the sale of a 3.11-acre parcel in Jalan Ampang by Loke Wan Yat Realty Sdn Bhd to Singapore developer Oxley Group for RM446 million or RM3,300 psf. \\u201cOther transactions are of smaller parcels located off Jalan Raja Chulan (in Jalan Bukit Ceylon, Changkat Ceylon and Changkat Raja Chulan), which were done at RM650 psf to as high as RM2,200 psf,\\u201d he adds. LaurelCap Sdn Bhd director Stanley Toh, meanwhile, says RM3,500 psf is \\u201con the higher side of the spectrum, taking into account the current property market sentiment\\u201d. While he describes the location as \\u201csuperb\\u201d, given that it is within walking distance of major shopping centres and near the much-coveted Bukit Bintang and Jalan Sultan Ismail addresses, he says with a plot ratio of eight, the developer would have to \\u201cbreak the barrier\\u201d of serviced apartment prices in KL to make the land cost feasible. \\u201cWith the land cost at RM3,500 psf, you would probably need to get a plot ratio of 10 and above in order for the project to be viable. \\u201cUnfortunately, the timing is not the best to realise the full potential of the land. Nevertheless, holding power is key in these trying times as the market will be back in full swing in the next cycle.\\u201d Tang, however, feels that the development can be financially viable because Jalan Raja Chulan is a prime location. \\u201cHowever, the developer will have to come out with an extraordinary design and sales package and ensure sales happen at a quick pace as there is little room for error. It will also have to price the units above RM2,000 psf, which will make it more challenging as it will be higher than a nearby project and considering the softer market. The small land size will also pose some design constraints as parking space will have to go up many floors to accommodate the numbers required,\\u201d he adds.  Market for serviced apartments What is the market like for serviced apartments now? Wong, citing Venus Assets Sdn Bhd\\u2019s Four Seasons Place branded residences next to the Petronas Twin Towers and Alpine Return Sdn Bhd\\u2019s Star Residences in Jalan Yap Kwan Seng, says the response to both properties was heartening. According to a source familiar with\\u00a0 Four Seasons Place, the branded residence\\u2019s sales are at 80% since the project was launched in 1Q2013. Typical units have built-ups of 1,098 sq ft to 3,843 sq ft and\\u00a0 layouts of 1+1 bedrooms to 4+1 bedrooms. \\u201cA mid-size unit recently sold for over RM3,400 psf, the highest price so far,\\u201d says the source. Meanwhile, Star Residences\\u2019 first phase has achieved 80% sales since it was launched in January last year, says Alpine Return chief operating officer Alan Koh. The first phase comprises 557 units with built-ups of 625 to 722 sq ft, and 1-bedroom and 1+1-bedroom units. They were sold for RM1,600 psf, or between RM1 million and RM1.3 million each. The second phase, which is scheduled to be launched in September, will comprise 482 units with built-ups of 700 to 800 sq ft. These will be sold at RM2,000 to RM2,100 psf, says Koh. Meanwhile, Tang says units with built-ups of 600 to 800 sq ft are easier to sell, whereas the opposite is true for units above 2,000 sq ft. \\u201cMarket sentiment is generally softer and speculative activities have declined significantly. End financing is a major issue faced by buyers,\\u201d he adds. LaurelCap\\u2019s Toh says the National Property Information Centre\\u2019s third quarter 2014 residential property stock report shows that the existing stock of serviced apartments in Seksyen 1 to 100 (Jalan Raja Chulan falls under Seksyen 57) stands at 11,203 units, with another 10,305 units under construction and 1,431 units planned. He also observes that the current market is \\u201cnot the best\\u201d one for high-end developments. He adds that the market is still driven by local rather than foreign demand. \\u201cNevertheless, there is a small group of purchasers with interest in high-end serviced residences accompanied by a high-end and branded operator such as Banyan Tree, for example. However, this group is quite limited and this trend has already been tapped by developers. Brands such as Harrods, Kempinski and Jumeirah are some of the operators that will be making their foray into Kuala Lumpur,\\u201d he says. So in short, while the Jalan Raja Chulan parcel\\u2019s location is fantastic, buyers will need to either come up with an outstanding product and marketing plan,\\u00a0 apply for a higher plot ratio or have enough holding power to wait for the next property cycle, say consultants.

The KLCI closed at 1,791.74 points in line with dampened sentiment in Asian markets. The KLCI had pared losses after declining to an intraday low of 1,778.99 earlier. Reuters reported that Asian stocks buckled while the dollar held firm on Monday after strong U.S. jobs data fanned expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve may raise interest rates sooner than previously thought. Japan\\u2019s Nikkei fell 0.95%, while South Korea\\u2019s Kospi declined 1%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.17% According to Bloomberg, the ringgit weakened to 3.6800 against the US dollar, and was trading at 2.6669 against the Singapore dollar. A stronger dollar is also expected to lower crude oil prices, which will not bode well for the Malaysian economy as the commodity forms a crucial component of the domestic economy. In Malaysia, Danny Wong, chief executive officer of Areca Capital Sdn Bhd, attributed the fall in the KLCI to the weakening\\u00a0 ringgit against the US dollar. Wong said the weaker ringgit might have led to the selldown in oil and gas- related counters such as Petronas Dagangan Bhd and Petronas Gas Bhd \\u201cThere is this perception that Malaysia is going into a crisis as the ringgit is trading near the 1997 crisis levels of around RM3.70 to RM3.80, despite Malaysia being much stronger now,\\u201d Wong said.

The most active stock was Privasia Technology Bhd."}, "574": {"date_posted": "6/3/2015", "title": "Weighing Bintai Kinden\\u2019s cash call", "article": " OLD-TIMERS would remember Bintai Kinden Corp Bhd, whose portfolio included mechanical and electrical engineering works for iconic developments such as the Petronas Twin Towers, the Kuala Lumpur Tower and the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. In its heyday in the early 2000s, its market capitalisation was over RM650 million but today, it stands at only RM33 million, barely 5% of its peak in 2001. The company has been loss-making for the past three fiscal years but some trading interest returned to Bintai Kinden (fundamental: 0.35; valuation: 1.2) late last year after its 69.82%-owned subsidiary, Bintai Kindenko Pte Ltd, won multi-million dollar contracts in Singapore. Earnings for at least one of these contracts would be booked in the coming months. A sub-contract worth S$24.15 million (RM63.5 million) is slated for completion on June 9. Another sub-contract worth S$44.65 million is slated for completion on May 9, 2016. But would this be reason enough for investors to take up Bintai Kinden\\u2019s proposed share placement and warrant-sweetened rights issue? Bintai Kinden last Wednesday announced plans to place out up to 10% of its share base, a move that will raise RM3 million if the shares are sold at an illustrative price of 30 sen. It also proposed to raise RM3.96 million to RM20.5 million via a warrant-sweetened rights issue to bolster its working capital and pare debt, its Feb 4 statement to Bursa Malaysia read. Proceeds for the latter assume that the rights shares are issued at a par value of 20 sen and can vary depending on the final issue price and the take-up for the nine-for-10 rights issuance that come with a free warrant for each rights share. The rights issue, which will only happen if the proposed share placement is successful, is not underwritten but will proceed even if the only taker is its major shareholder Bintai Holdings (M) Sdn Bhd, which has promised to take up in full its entitlement of 19.8 million rights shares with 19.8 million free warrants. At a minimum issue price of 20 sen, the rights shares will raise RM3.96 million \\u2014 a sum that will go to working capital, the company said. The rights issue still needs shareholder approval to proceed but the company has obtained a blanket approval from shareholders at its recent AGM to issue up to 10% of its share base for the proposed placement. Based on the illustration provided in its Feb 4 announcement, Bintai Kinden\\u2019s gearing of 2.49 times as at March 31, 2014, will remain high at 2.37 times after the proposed private placement. Its gearing will only fall to 2.25 times if it receives minimum take-up for its rights issue and reduce to 1.68 times if it sees maximum take-up for its rights issue. Bintai Kinden\\u2019s interest-bearing borrowings stood at RM144.14 million as at March 31, 2014, but rose to RM247.1 million as at Dec 31, 2014, according to the same statement. The stock closed at 32 sen last Thursday, about 0.68 times its net asset per share of 47 sen as at Sept 30, 2014. If issued at par of 20 sen apiece, the rights shares would be at a substantial discount to its net asset per share but much of Bintai Kinden\\u2019s asset base consist of receivables, some of which involve long-drawn legal suits, according to notes accompanying its accounts. Receivables stood at RM300.46 million, 80.7% of its unaudited total asset of RM372.2 million as at Sept 30, 2014, while short-term borrowings stood at RM217.05 million. Cash and bank balances were RM35.26 million. The potentially high gearing after the proposed exercises means that Bintai Kinden is not for the risk averse, even though the stock might see larger trading interest with a larger share base from the rights shares and warrants. Investors that can stomach the risk, however, may want to also watch Singapore\\u2019s Catalist-listed Lereno Bio-Chem Ltd (fundamental: 0.00; valuation: 0.00), in which Bintai Kinden has a minority stake of 3.43%. Bintai Kinden\\u2019s major shareholder and executive vice chairman, Ong Puay Koon, is also Lereno\\u2019s managing director and CEO. His son, Choon Lui, sits on Lereno\\u2019s board and is Bintai Kinden\\u2019s managing director and CEO. Together, they owned about 22.72% of Bintai Kinden as at July 31, 2014 and at least 28.2% of Lereno as at Oct 25, 2013. It is also worth noting that in April 2011, Bintai Kinden proposed to sell its entire 69.82% stake in Bintai Kindenko to Lereno for RM150 million worth of new shares in the latter \\u2014 a deal which was allowed to lapse by September the same year. This could prove to be good news for Bintai Kinden\\u2019s shareholders, considering Bintai Kindenko\\u2019s recent sub-contract wins in Singapore and the fact that shares of loss-making Lereno are languishing. Interestingly, Bintai Kinden\\u2019s shares went as high as 45 sen on June 17 last year, higher than when the company announced the bagging of the contracts in Singapore about two months later. This jump in trading activity was captured in Stocks under Momentum by theedgemarkets.com and came about when Lereno was queried by the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX). In reply to the SGX query, Ong senior on June 9 last year said Lereno\\u2019s board \\u201chad commenced preliminary discussions with various parties in relation to the potential acquisitions of new businesses\\u201d pursuant to a restructuring but added that these discussions might or might not result in a deal. Lereno was still looking for a new core business at the time of writing. Whether or not Bintai Kinden\\u2019s proposed cash calls are a prelude to more corporate exercises to revive its fortune, its major shareholder can potentially gain a waiver from making a mandatory general offer (MGO) should its shareholding cross the 33% trigger as a result of the proposed exercise. Ong\\u2019s Bintai Holdings will only cross the 33% MGO trigger if it exercises its warrants after subscribing to its rights entitlement, according to its Feb 4 statement. It intends to seek a MGO waiver. At the time of writing, Bintai Kinden had not released earnings for the quarter ended Dec 31, 2014, but the company has said the numbers will not benefit from its recent Singapore contract wins. For the six months ended Sept 30, 2014, it booked RM11.86 million net losses on the back of a 24.6% year-on-year fall in revenue to RM178.12 million. Its core specialised mechanical and electrical engineering services segment contributed over 80% of operating revenue but was also the main source of operational losses of RM7.93 million. Its trading segment was also loss-making but the property development, investment holding as well as turnkey, infrastructure and civil and structural businesses were profitable. It remains to be seen whether the major shareholders\\u2019 willingness to pump in more cash will improve the fortunes of the group. But first, it will need to find takers for its planned share placement.

Its wholly-owned subsidiary Harvest Court Construction Sdn Bhd, and Sagajuta, was also unable to reach a consensus on the variation of the design and construction contract sum, due to increase in material and labour cost since the letter of award (LoA) was issued on Nov 21, 2011. \"Pursuant to the LoA, the parties has agreed that the contract price for the design and construction contract works would be RM129 million. To date, Harvest Court Construction has carried out 14.8% of the works,\" it added.

The share prices of some of these companies have rebounded after the heavy selldown last year. A favourable catalyst for the sector\\u2019s fundamentals, as well as on investor sentiment, is the recent rebound in the Brent crude oil price. After bottoming out at US$46.59 per barrel on Jan 13, it shot up to US$58.25 as at Feb 6, or a gain of 25%. After the nerve-racking plunge of oil and gas stocks, some analysts and fund managers have regained some confidence in the sector. The current share prices, they believe, have factored in all the bad news. The more optimistic among them say another rally could be on the way. Experts say that while there are still key concerns about an oversupply of crude oil, companies should remain resilient, particularly those with minimal exposure to fluctuations in the price of the commodity. The crucial question is whether local oil and gas players will be able to maintain their earnings in the face of headwinds. \\u201cWe will definitely start to see the impact (of falling oil prices) in the fourth quarter (ended Dec 31, 2014) for some companies. Those in production-related activities will be less impacted currently but the ones that are involved in drilling and exploration will definitely be hit,\\u201d says a senior executive of a major oil and gas services provider. In a recent note, Macquarie Research projects a significant expansion in the valuations of Malaysian oil and gas stocks under its coverage, following a largely disappointing 2014. While there was a downgrade in earnings per share, partly due to the falling oil price, the research outfit says it expects the trend to reverse this year as earnings growth should occur in tandem with a possible crude oil price recovery. Maybank IB Research has reiterated its \\u201cbuy\\u201d calls for 9 out of 13 oil and gas stocks under its coverage, projecting a sector earnings multiple average of a reasonable 12.9 times. Its 12-month price targets for the stocks imply an upside potential of up to 70% from present prices. Credit Suisse managing director and co-head of oil and gas research David Hewitt believes that there are concrete reasons to remain bullish on the crude oil price trajectory. \\u201cBear in mind that there are many upstream operators whose earnings are minimally exposed to the oil price volatility. In the previous two downcycles, the crude oil price doubled from its trough within 12 months, so there is a huge upside in the fundamentals.\\u201d Shares of oil services companies have fallen the most as they were highly exposed to crude oil prices, in addition to Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) cutting its capex by between 15% and 20% this year. For example, operators such as Perisai Petroleum Teknologi Bhd (jackup rigs), Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd (offshore construction and marine repairs) and Alam Maritim Resources Bhd (offshore support vessels) have seen their shares decline by more than 60% since June. Over the past six months, these companies reported much lower earnings, suggesting that the share price decline was partly justified by the worsening fundamentals. On the other hand, companies with stronger balance sheets and large order books have much better prospects. In a recent sector note, Credit Suisse says it favours quality stocks with attractive valuations and those that are relatively unimpacted by oil price volatility, highlighting SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd and Dialog Group Bhd in particular. It says that for SapuraKencana, only about 10% of its business is directly exposed to the oil price. Its price-to-book of 1.51 times is also at a historic trough, suggesting that its stock price has tremendous upside potential. An oil and gas analyst says companies such as Dialog and Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd present minimal downside risks thanks to their large order books and long-term commitment to Petronas\\u2019 RAPID project. \\u201cFor the sector, we expect to see some resilience, which translates into an incremental increase in earnings for now. While a pickup in upstream activity would certainly help, we prefer stocks which are more reliant towards long-term contracts and steady revenue expectations,\\u201d he says. Companies who are carrying out risk service contracts (RSC) with Petronas, such as Uzma Bhd and Petra Energy Bhd, look set to maintain their impressive earnings growth. This is because they will continue to recognise profits based on performance. Conversely, Petronas owns all of the oil extracted and is the one exposed to crude oil price volatility. This is evident from the earnings performance of the two. For the quarter ended Sept 30, 2014, both Dialog and Uzma reported a stronger quarter-on-quarter net profit growth in spite of the bearishness in the sector, which began in June as crude oil dipped below US$100 per barrel. In a Feb 5 note, UOB Kay Hian Research states that this may already be happening. \\u201cWe have turned neutral (from underweight) on the oil and gas sector following the share price recovery, noting that most oil and gas stocks under our coverage have rebounded by 20% to 40% from recent lows,\\u201d it says. \\u00a0 This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on February 9 - 15, 2015."}, "578": {"date_posted": "26/2/2015", "title": "Icon Offshore clinches six Carigali packages", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: Offshore support vessel (OSV) provider Icon Offshore Bhd has clinched six out of the eight packages being offered by Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd under the latter\\u2019s umbrella contract for the provision of the spot charter of marine vessels.

KNM Group Bhd saw its net profit for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2014 (FY14) doubled to RM45.69 million or 2.94 sen per share, from RM23.45 or 1.6 sen per share a year earlier, due to improved margins. Revenue however, declined 12.3% to RM1.87 billion, compared to RM1.99 billion a year ago. In the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2014 (4QFY14), KNM (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.2) saw its net profit fall 47.22% to RM3.97 million or 0.26 sen per share, from RM7.51 million or 0.51 sen per share in 4QFY13. Revenue for the quarter was down 21.54% to RM451.24 million, from RM575.13 million in 4QFY13. Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) has received a letter of award (LoA) from the government for the implementation of both the High Speed Broadband Phase 2 (HSBB 2) and the Sub-Urban Broadband (SUBB) projects. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, TM (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 0.9) said the collaboration with the government would see it deploy the access and domestic core networks to deliver an end-to-end HSBB infrasructure for both projects. Both HSBB 2 and SUBB, with investment costs of RM1.8 billion and RM1.6 billion respectively, are for a period of 10 years, it said. Utusan Melayu (Malaysia) Bhd saw its net loss multiply to RM44.32 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2014, from RM4.66 million in the year before, bringing its loss per share (LPS) to 40.03 sen from 4.20 sen, due to lower revenue and higher impairment charges on trade and other receivables. Its revenue for the quarter was RM76.64 million, down 15% from RM89.82 million in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. For the financial year ended Dec 31, 2014, Utusan\\u2019s (fundamental: 0.2; valuation: 1.2) net loss widened to RM80.9 million, from RM16.21 million in the year before; while revenue fell 15% to RM291.32 million, from RM342.43 million. Its LPS for the year was higher at 73.05 sen, compared to 14.64 sen. Media Prima Bhd (fundamental: 1.8; valuation: 1.2) slipped into the red in its fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2014 (4QFY14), with a net loss of RM29.49 million, from a profit of RM63.44 million in the previous corresponding quarter, due to expenses incurred for its mutual separation scheme (MSS). Excluding the one-off MSS effect, the group\\u2019s net profit declined by 13% from 4QFY13, Media Prima told Bursa today. Revenue for the quarter also came in lower at RM384.7 million, down 14.8% from RM451.56 million previously. The group announced a final single-tier dividend of 5 sen per share for the quarter, bringing the total dividend for FY14 to 11 sen per share, which is 21.4% lower than the 14 sen per share in FY13. Its full FY14 net profit was RM75.53 million, down 64.7% from RM214.02 million in FY13; revenue also slipped 12.5% to RM1.51 billion, from RM1.72 billion previously. The company attributed the weaker full year earnings to market uncertainties, weak consumer sentiments, and the tragic airlines incidents that caused advertisers to take a more cautions stance on advertisement placement. Offshore support vessel (OSV) provider Icon Offshore Bhd has clinched six out of the eight packages being offered by Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd, under the latter's umbrella contract for the provision of spot charter of marine vessels. In a press statement, Icon Offshore (fundamental score: 0.95; valuation score: 0.90) said its wholly-owned subsidiary Icon Offshore Group Sdn Bhd had recently received a Letter of Award (LoA) for the said packages, which included ones for the provision of marine vessels in the categories of anchor handling tug/supply, vessel, straight supply vessel, platform supply vessel, utility vessel, workboat and work barge. Petra Energy Bhd has returned to black in its fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2014, with a net profit of RM5.32 million, compared to the previous corresponding quarter\\u2019s loss of RM80,000. Revenue too, was up by 40.94% year-on-year to RM221.63 million. The oil and gas services provider also doubled its dividend payout in the quarter under review, to two sen a share. For the whole of FY14, net profit was up 163% year-on-year to RM33.49 million or 10.41 sen a share. This compared with FY13\\u2019s earnings of RM12.74 million or 4.2 sen per share. Petra (fundamental: 0.8; valuation: 1.2) registered revenue of RM638.63 million in FY14, which was 30.16% higher than the previous year\\u2019s RM490.65 million. Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) has upped the offer price by 50 sen to RM3.25 for shares it does not own in port operator, Integrax Bhd, after Perak Corp Bhd (fundamental: 1.9; valuation: 1.2) rejected the RM2.75 offer price on Monday. With this new offer price, TNB (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.8) which holds 22.12% of Integrax (fundamental: 1.65; valuation: 0.6), will now have to fork out RM761.38 million to take over Integrax, which is an additional RM117.14 million, from RM644.24 million previously. Tan Chong Motor Holdings Bhd (fundamental: 0.8; valuation: 1.8) saw its net profit for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2014, plunged 87.2% to RM8.67 million or 1.33 sen share, while revenue dipped 6.7% to RM1.26 billion, as fierce promotional campaigns in the automotive sector hit profit margins. Its 2014 full year net profit also dropped 57.82% to RM105.85 million, as revenue fell 8.4% to RM4.76 billion. In its filing to Bursa Malaysia, the Nissan vehicles distributor said due to the highly competitive environment in the local automotive industry, it had stepped up promotional campaigns to sustain market share and reduce its inventory, at the expense of profit margins. The group noted the strong promotional campaigns had reduced its inventory to RM1.52 billion as at Dec 31, 2014, from RM1.73 billion as at Dec 31, 2013. Tan Chong noted its prospects remain challenging, as the weakening ringgit has added pressure on the imported costs of materials required in the automotive industry.

It is understood that initially, Coastal Energy and Petra Energy had banded together to bid for the oil portion of the block while Talisman had wanted the gas portion. But the drastic fall in oil prices changed the operating environment. \\u201cTalks with Petronas were ongoing. If not for the massive dip in oil prices, the companies [Talisman, Coastal and Petra] would have concluded the deal late last year,\\u201d says a source. Neither Petra Energy\\u2019s nor Petronas\\u2019 officials were available for comment. Declining to offer an educated guess, sources say the EOR contract could be worth a \\u201csubstantial amount\\u201d. The pending award has sparked considerable interest as it indicates that Petronas still has contracts to dish out despite the price of oil crashing close to 57% since last June when it was around US$115 per barrel. Last Friday, oil was trading below US$50 a barrel. Petronas had also said that it could cut capital expenditure by between 15% and 20% this year. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Industry sources say the EOR contract is premised on Petra and its partner Coastal\\u2019s performance on the risk service contract for the Kapal, Banang and Meranti oilfields in Block PM316 off the peninsula that was awarded in July 2012. Coastal is the operator of the cluster fields with 70% equity interest while Petra has a 30% stake. Coastal and Petra stayed ahead of schedule and spent less than the stipulated amount on the project, which earned them brownie points from Petronas and put them in the front row for other jobs, such as the one for PM9. Oil was discovered in the Kapal field first in December 2013 and some 10,000 barrels per day (bpd) were produced. The amount would have increased by now. \\u201cCompared with the rest, Coastal and Petra have done absolutely well,\\u201d says the source, who is an oil and gas executive. \\u00a0 Meanwhile, a tussle between Talisman and Coastal was sorted out at parent level. Both parties are linked to Spain-based Repsol SA, which had acquired Talisman for US$8.3 billion late last year. Repsol and Cepsa, also Spain-based, have their origins in state-owned petroleum company Compa\\u00f1\\u00eda Arrendataria del Monopolio del Petr\\u00f3leo, SA (Campsa), which was set up in 1920. Campsa\\u2019s assets were distributed in 1992 to the largest private petroleum companies in the country, including Repsol and Cepsa. Cepsa owns Coastal, which explains the recent truce between the latter and Talisman. However, the equity structure of the partnership is unclear. Nevertheless, the EOR contract would boost Petra\\u2019s bottom line. For its nine months ended Sept 30, 2014, net profit was RM28.2 million on revenue of RM417 million. It is also not clear what sort of capital outlay will be required for the job but as at Sept 30, 2014, Petra had cash and bank balances of RM59.6 million as well as short-term and long-term debt commitments of RM253.1 million and RM86.6 billion respectively. Petra has also been divesting assets, such as its 51% stake in Bumi Subsea Sdn Bhd and 70% in Jurutera Perunding Sdn Bhd, likely shoring up its coffers. The sale of the two assets, however, only raised about RM530,000. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Since hitting a record high of RM3.14 on June 19 last year, Petra\\u2019s shares have fallen more than 55% and closed at RM1.30 last Friday. While Petra and its partners could be popping the bubbly soon, another company that could benefit from the award is Perisai Petroleum Teknologi Bhd. About a year ago, Perisai was rumoured to be Talisman\\u2019s partner in bidding for the PM9 job. They were the favourites to win because Talisman\\u2019s blocks \\u2014 PM3CAA, PM314 and PM305 \\u2014 were located close to PM9. But Perisai dropped out of the deal for reasons unknown. Its mobile offshore production unit (MOPU) that was slated for the job thus became idle. This and other complications saw Perisai\\u2019s shares lose more than 70% of their value from a year ago and hit their lowest level since the first quarter of 2009. The stock closed at 47.5 sen last Friday. Perisai has a decent set of assets, including three jackup rigs, a floating production, storage and offloadingvessel, the MOPU Rubicon, three anchor handling tug supply vessels, three crew boats and a derrick lay vessel. \\u00a0 This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on February 2 - 8 , 2015."}, "581": {"date_posted": "25/2/2015", "title": "Icon Offshore clinches six out of eight packages offered by Petronas Carigali's umbrella contract", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 25): Offshore support vessel (OSV) provider Icon Offshore Bhd has clinched six out of the eight packages being offered by Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd under the latter's umbrella contract for the provision of the spot charter of marine vessels.

The Balai Cluster marginal oil field is part of Petronas\\u2019 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) programme to revive flagging production from mature and depleting oil wells. As such, Petronas views it as a costly, non-essential expense. \\u201cThe delay could go on until 2016. Petronas expects that is when crude oil [prices] will hit US$80 [per barrel] as shale oil and crude oil prices reach an equilibrium,\\u201d said one source. If the postponement comes through, the Balai Cluster project will become one of the victims of capital expenditure (capex) tightening measures undertaken by the state-owned oil corporation to combat the impact of depressed crude oil prices on its earnings.\\u00a0 As it is, outgoing Petronas president and group chief executive officer Tan Sri Shamsul Azhar Abbas (pic) had already issued a warning late last year that Petronas would be cutting up to 20% of its capex. The Edge Financial Daily also learnt that Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd is now renegotiating its current contracts and is seeking for discounts of up to 30%. It sent a circular to all its contractors last month informing them of a slowdown in exploration works, said a source familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, a Dialog (fundamental: 2.1; valuation: 0.7) official, when contacted, declined to comment on the possible delay in the Balai Cluster project\\u2019s development phase, saying that the decision lies solely with Petronas. Dialog yesterday closed four sen or 2.5% higher at RM1.64, giving it a market capitalisation of RM7.9 billion. Located some 130km northeast of Bintulu, Sarawak, the Balai Cluster project is operated and managed by BC Petroleum Sdn Bhd, a tripartite joint venture among Roc Oil Malaysia (Holdings) Sdn Bhd (with a 48% stake), Dialog (32%) and Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd (20%). The project comprises a cluster of marginal oil and gas (O&G) fields \\u2014 namely Balai, Bentara, West Acis and Spaoh. The 15-year RSC, awarded by Petronas in August 2011, is the second of its kind. Separated into two phases, the Balai Cluster project has undergone its pre-development phase and the development phase or second phase was supposed to take place after the submission of development plans for all the fields. At the time of the announcement, Dialog said the total cost of the development phase would be between US$650 million and US$700 million. The development phase\\u2019s plans included drilling of additional wells, installation and commissioning of other support facilities. Last year, Shamsul said Petronas would not award new marginal oilfield contracts until crude oil prices hit US$80 per barrel. O&G service providers of all kinds are already feeling the pinch of the state oil company\\u2019s tightening measures as Petronas is also looking to cut costs of all ongoing projects. \\u201cPetronas\\u2019 initial forecast also had a higher volume of work. Now contractors will be feeling the brunt of it as not only will they be forced to give lower prices but will also be receiving a substantially lower work order. The smaller ones, especially, will be heavily affected,\\u201d said an O&G executive. With fewer jobs and lower contract values, industry insiders expressed concerns that service players would not be able to sustain the high costs of their operations after crude oil prices have been nearly halved from a peak of US$114 per barrel last year. At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at US$59.38 per barrel while the West Texas Intermediate was at US$49.70 per barrel. \\u201cLayoffs have been done, and could continue to happen for a while,\\u201d said another executive, adding that contract workers are the ones who are most likely to be the first to go. Last December, upstream O&G player TH Heavy Engineering Bhd, unable to withstand the current headwinds in the O&G industry amid tumbling crude oil prices, announced that it would be retrenching some redundant staff, but did not say how many.\\u00a0 The Edge Research\\u2019s fundamental score reflects a company\\u2019s profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers.

As these become less economically viable, a shutdown in planned drilling projects could follow. This is worrying for companies such as UMW Oil and Gas Bhd (UMWOG) and Perisai Petroleum Teknologi Bhd, both of which are taking deliveries of new premium jackup rigs over the next two years. Jackup utilisation rates are currently at about 74% globally compared with 85% a year ago, according to oil and gas data provider Rigzone. At present, UMWOG (fundamental: 1.45; valuation: 0.6) and Perisai (fundamental: 0.35; valuation: 1.2) face a multitude of unfavourable developments in the industry, namely the incoming oversupply of rigs, the softening in demand for E&P works amid low crude prices and Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u2019s (Petronas) move to cut its capital expenditure by 15% to 20% this year. Both UMWOG\\u2019s and Perisai\\u2019s jackup rigs, which are worth hundreds of millions of ringgit and are usually financed via long-term debt, would need to be operational immediately in order to recoup costs. Both companies were previously reliant on long-term charters with Petronas and now face intense competition for the same tenders. The average DCR in the region stands at about US$140,000 to US$150,000 for a short-term lease that typically lasts 100 days. UMWOG has two new builds scheduled for delivery this year. Naga 7 was to be delivered last month and Naga 8 in September. Perisai\\u2019s next jackup rigs, PP102 and PP103, will enter the market in mid-2015 and mid-2016, respectively. According to Bloomberg, 10 jackup rig contracts are due to expire in Malaysian waters by the end of this year. Four of the rigs are chartered by Petronas and six out of the 10 will expire by the first half of this year (1H15). While UMWOG\\u2019s Naga 7 will immediately be put to work after securing a six-month works contract, it is crucial for Perisai to charter out PP102 by the first half of this year. In a Jan 6 note, RHB Research points out that Perisai faces a significant earnings downgrade should PP102 fail to get a contract this year. \\u201cIts earnings are highly dependent on PP102 obtaining a contract. We have given the company the benefit of the doubt and are imputing 100 days of charter for PP102 this year, but we recognise a downside risk should a charter fail to materialise,\\u201d says the research house, which has a \\u201csell\\u201d rating on Perisai\\u2019s stock, with a fair value of 35 sen. In spite of the bearish factors, the shares of both companies have rebounded strongly over the past month and appreciated despite the continuing decline in Brent crude prices. Between Jan 1 and 28, the shares of Perisai and UMWOG appreciated 6.64% and 15% respectively, while Brent crude fell 11.6% during the same period. There are signs that the shares are now trading at attractive valuations, especially if oil prices were to quickly rebound as they did in 2008 (from US$36 per barrel to US$100 in less than 1.5 years). Such a recovery would trigger a fresh round of E&P spending and a spike in demand for drilling activity, which would potentially propel oil and gas stocks to their previous highs. During the 2008-09 financial crisis, global oil and gas supply capacity outpaced plummeting demand brought about by the global credit crunch, causing projects to stall and new works contracts to be deferred. The situation is comparatively better now for the upstream segment, with Petronas operating more than 100 production-sharing contracts and the development of marginal fields which began in 2011. Credit Suisse managing director and co-head of global oil and gas David Hewitt believes that the outlook for Malaysian rig operators is brighter than for their regional counterparts. \\u201cIf the shares are at low valuations, the upside is the potential of mergers and acquisitions as a viable investment strategy. If there is a rebound in prices, the oil majors can quickly reallocate sums and restart previous opportunities. The prevailing themes for the smaller players are leveraging, cash-in-hand, and their ability to survive bad times,\\u201d he says. Hewitt adds that Petronas, as an unlisted state-owned oil corporation unlike its Chinese counterparts, has its own key drivers and can be the catalyst for growth in the domestic E&P segment. Fundamentals for UMWOG and Perisai show a vast difference in their valuation and financial condition. Net debt to equity for Perisai stands at 129.2%, compared with 28% for UMWOG, which is still flush with cash following its November 2013 listing. However, this also means that UMWOG\\u2019s stock is trading at a large premium to its assets. Its book value per share is RM1.40 compared with its closing price of RM2.70 on Jan 28. This translates into a price-to-book multiple of 1.97 times. In contrast, Perisai\\u2019s book value per share is 91 sen, far above its Jan 28 closing of 48.5 sen. While this is due to the earnings uncertainty faced by its upcoming rigs, the stock\\u2019s undervaluation could also mean a limited downside risk for now  Note: The Edge Research\\u2019s fundamental score reflects a company\\u2019s profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers.

Kong said FY14 was challenging for Petronas Chemicals, as production was affected by major maintenance and turnaround up until the third quarter (3Q), while the last quarter saw product prices dipped an average 33.8%, in tandem with falling oil prices. \\u00a0 Major maintenance and statutory turnarounds, coupled with falling petrochemical product prices dragged revenue down by 4% year-on-year, he said. Kong noted that 72% of revenue was derived from the olefins and derivatives (O&D) segment while the remaining 28% came from the fertilisers and methanol (F&M) segment. Core profit was lower y-o-y by 13.5% as higher margin product capacities were affected by the turnaround with O&D contributing some 67% of core profit and F&M the balance. Full-year plant utilisation was 80%. Kong said full-year dividend per share (DPS) for Petronas Chemicals at 16 sen was in line with the research firm\\u2019s estimates. The research firm expects product prices to recover in financial year 2015 (FY15), underpinned by a forecasted upward trend in crude oil prices. \\u201cWe are bullish on petrochemicals and are expecting prices to close the year higher by 16%, compared with end of FY14,\\u201d Kong said. \\u201cThe higher prices could be driven by higher crude oil prices (petrochemical product prices have a positive correlation of 0.88 to crude oil prices) as well as recovering global demand for petrochemicals. \\u201cAs there are no more turnarounds for FY15, we are forecasting a full-year average plant utilisation of 87.5%,\\u201d he added. Kong expects fertiliser prices to remain steady due to an expected tight supply, coupled with increasing demand from China and India. \\u201cA point to note, India is facing a shortage of 8m tonnes of urea as the government is no longer providing subsidies to naphtha- based urea producers,\\u201d he added. The research firm upgraded its call on Petronas Chemicals to \\u201cBuy\\u201d from \\u201cNeutral\\u201d with a higher target price of RM6.22 from RM6.08, based on a FY15 forecast of 14.6 times price to earnings ratio (PER), in line with regional petrochemical producers. \n(Note: The Edge Research's fundamental score reflects a company\\u2019s profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers.

For 4QFY14, AAX's passenger traffic grew 9.3% year-on-year, against an 8.5% increase in available-seat-kilometre (ASK) capacity, the company said in a statement today. Its 4QFY14 revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) also improved, growing by 9.3% to 5.31 million from 4.86 million. Consequently, AAX said its load factor improved by 0.5 percentage points to 81.4%, implying capacity injected during the peak quarter was well absorbed by demand arising from year-end holiday travel. For the full year (FY14), its passenger size grew by 33.8% y-o-y or 1.1 million passengers to 4.23 million passengers in financial year 2014 (FY14) from 3.16 million in financial year 2013 (FY13). Its RPK for FY14 was at 20.82 million, up 31.3% from 15.86 million in FY13.

However, the Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water last week announced that electricity tariffs are expected to remain relatively unchanged for the rest of the year. This isn\\u2019t welcome news for the public, but it bodes well for Tenaga Nasional Bhd (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1), whose share price surged 3.99% to close at RM15.10 on Friday after the announcement. But is the optimism about Tenaga\\u2019s earnings premature, or did the ministry miscalculate the impact of lower fuel prices? According to the ministry, the recent decline in oil prices does not have a direct or substantial impact on Tenaga\\u2019s fuel costs. If that is the case, Tenaga\\u2019s earnings would not get a boost from lower fuel costs even if tariffs were not revised downwards. Nonetheless, Tenaga last Thursday unveiled a 34.37% year-on-year jump in net profit for the first quarter ended Nov 30, 2014.\\u00a0 The earnings rise was attributed to a drop in fuel costs as well as the 14.9% effective hike in electricity tariff at the beginning of 2014 that boosted revenue by 15.2% to RM11.03 billion in the same period. In fact, Tenaga\\u2019s earnings performance trumped analysts\\u2019 expectations. Seventeen analysts upgraded their target price on Tenaga to an average of RM16.99. \\u201cCrude price has plunged, but that has not yet translated into lower LNG price (up to 6-month lag) as we understand Tenaga\\u2019s LNG purchase price in January-March remained firm at RM46.53 per mmbtu (vs RM46.04 in 4QCY14).\\u00a0 However, Tenaga may benefit from lower gas usage in 2QFY15 given a more favourable fuel mix towards hydro and coal, potentially leading to another strong quarter,\\u201d writes AllianceDBS in a research report. \\u00a0\\u201cFor 4MFY15 (Sept to Dec 2014), coal price averaged US$64 per tonne, 27% lower than the US$87.5 imputed in the existing tariff formula. We expect the coal price to stay low due to oversupply and a weaker demand outlook, which will benefit Tenaga,\\u201d it\\u00a0 adds. \\u00a0If this trend continues and tariffs remain unchanged, Tenaga might be able to book better earnings despite the ministry\\u2019s reservations. That said, these gains could be offset if the government allows Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) to resume increasing the price of piped natural gas. Petronas currently supplies about 1,000 mmscfd of natural gas to Tenaga at a regulated price of RM15.20 per mmbtu. The natural gas price is supposed to be increased by RM1.50 to gradually put it on par with the market price under the gas subsidy rationalisation scheme. Each RM1.50 hike will increase Tenaga\\u2019s fuel cost by about RM280 million for a six-month period. The money would be a welcome boost to Petronas\\u2019 revenue a time when it is grappling with low oil prices. Hence, counter-intuitively, Tenaga\\u2019s piped natural gas price could actually increase even though crude oil prices are on the decline. To be fair, Tenaga has been enjoying cheap gas for many years at Petronas\\u2019 expense in the form of foregone revenue, given that the national oil firm could have exported the fuel at international prices. Note that in his budget revision speech, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak only stated that the piped gas price for industrial use would not be raised, but made no such commitment on gas used by Tenaga for generating power. \\u201cAlthough the cost of fuel prices may be falling in the market, the tariff might not be reduced in July. It will also depend on the price of piped gas if the government decides to resume the price increase of RM1.50 per mmbtu,\\u201d explains Datin Roslina Zainal, vice-president of Tenaga\\u2019s regulatory economics and planning division. On the balance of things, it looks like unchanged tariffs will be beneficial to\\u00a0 Tenaga going forward. Nonetheless, Roslina points out that the biggest factor that will affect Tenaga\\u2019s fuel costs going forward will be the amount of imported LNG it uses. Compared to piped gas that costs RM15.20 per mmbtu, imported LNG, which has to be shipped in and re-gasified, cost Tenaga about RM46.041 per mmbtu in the fourth quarter (October to December of 2014). Interestingly, Tenaga has little say in the cost of LNG, since it is a price taker and the price is set by Petronas, which procures the LNG. According to the ministry, the price of LNG supplied is still high since it is \\u201clinked to the ex-Bintulu LNG price and the Japan Customs-Cleared Crude (JCCC) price with a time lag of 2-4 months and 5-7 months, respectively\\u201d. \\u201cThe price of LNG remains above the reference price in the base tariff (RM41.68 per mmbtu). If the amount used is more than expected, it may offset any savings from the falling coal price,\\u201d explains Roslina. That said, there is some expectation that LNG prices will start to taper off towards the second half of the year, which could translate into potential savings for\\u00a0 Tenaga. Unchanged tariffs despite cost pass-through Come July, if tariffs are not revised based on the imbalance cost pass-through (ICPT) mechanism, the country would have gone almost two years at the same tariff. The last hike was in January 2014 and the next will only be in January 2016. This runs contrary to the government\\u2019s long-term goal of allowing fuel costs to be passed through to consumers. In fact, there were supposed to have been two tariff hikes in the past year based on the ICPT calculations \\u2014 one in July 2014 and another in January this year. This is another reason there isn\\u2019t much room for a downward revision in tariffs, since they weren\\u2019t raised when costs were higher in the first place. Nonetheless, Roslina points out that the ICPT has been fully implemented on Tenaga\\u2019s part. \\u201cTenaga calculates the ICPT difference and submits it to the government. If it is higher than the base tariff, the government then decides if it wants to raise the tariff or offset the difference by other means, like delaying gas price increases or utilising PPA (power purchase agreement) savings to offset the increase in fuel costs,\\u201d explains Roslina. Simply put, the government is still intervening heavily in electricity tariffs instead of allowing the cost to be passed through to the consumers. This is both a populist decision and one aimed at supporting a slowing economy that is facing rising inflation. Nonetheless, analysts and industry players see it as a positive move if tariffs are allowed to more closely track global energy prices. Keeping the tariff fixed would boost Tenaga\\u2019s earnings in the short term as fuel costs are coming down. But showing political will to allow tariffs to move in tandem with the fuel cost trend is even more critical as this will mean that Tenaga will not have to shoulder the fuel cost burden as it did in the past. \\u00a0 Nonetheless, investing sentiment on Tenaga is getting more bullish simply because there isn\\u2019t much concern about rising fuel costs on the horizon. \\u201cAt 14 times earnings, Tenaga is still attractive for a company that has regulated assets. It is difficult to fund regulated assets at this valuation elsewhere. As long as the implementation of incentive-based regulation is maintained, Tenaga will continue to perform,\\u201d says one fund manager.

Tycoon Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Albukhary and the late Tan Sri Lim Goh Tong\\u2019s family have plans for mixed-use development projects in Jalan Belfield, which is located less than 2km from the proposed Menara Warisan Merdeka (project name: KL118) undertaken by Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB). Two other players that will join in are listed companies Salcon Bhd and Bina Puri Holdings Bhd. Together, the projects are expected to cover 20 acres (see map). Property players say a combination of factors is driving developers to this area.\\u00a0 \\u201cScarcity of land in the KL Sentral area and infrastructure improvement in and around the location (Kampung Attap) have led to interest. This, coupled with high land prices in other locations, could have been the push factor. The pull factor would be faster approvals by DBKL (Kuala Lumpur City Hall) after the relocation of the palace,\\u201d Zerin Properties CEO Previndran Singhe tells The Edge. \\u00a0 Stanley Toh, director of valuation and real estate consultancy firm LaurelCap Sdn Bhd, agrees that scarcity of land is driving developers to Kampung Attap, which, incidentally, comprises largely government land. \\u201cThis area is one of the last in KL that is still undeveloped. Recently, it became a strategic location due to new mega developments in the neighbourhood, such as the Menara Warisan Merdeka project, the redevelopment of Pudu Jail (Bukit Bintang) and the mass rapid transit station in Jalan Maharajalela, as well as its proximity to KL Sentral.\\u201d He adds that the emergence of Menara Warisan Merdeka \\u2014 it will be the country\\u2019s tallest building when completed \\u2014 will see history repeat itself, just like when the then world\\u2019s tallest structure was built in Kuala Lumpur city centre. \\u201cWhen the Petronas Twin Towers/KLCC was constructed in the 1990s, the entire world started to know its location. The surrounding areas have benefited \\u2014 property prices skyrocketed, and until today, foreigners are only comfortable investing in areas close to KLCC. I see a very similar occurrence with Menara Warisan Merdeka, and it is clearly evident in the number of proposed developments in the vicinity.\\u201d \\u00a0 Salcon (fundamental: 2.1; valuation: 3), too, appears to be banking on a repeat of the KLCC success story in Kampung Attap. Its executive director Datuk Eddy Leong describes Menara Warisan Merdeka and the planned infrastructure/transport upgrade as the \\u201cnew epicentre of growth in KL\\u201d. The company plans to build offices, retail units and serviced apartments in Kampung Attap. \\u201cMenara Warisan Merdeka will be another iconic development not only for Kuala Lumpur but also for Malaysia. We expect it to have the same effect [that] KLCC has on the surrounding properties,\\u201d Leong says. PNB Merdeka Ventures Sdn Bhd is constructing the 118-storey building, which will feature 80 floors of office space and five floors of serviced apartments. Thirteen floors will be allocated for a hotel. This project will include an eight-storey retail podium. Sources say a two-level tunnel, named Belfield Tunnel, will link the fourth and fifth basement floors of the building to Kampung Attap, thereby bringing the areas now separated by Jalan Maharajalela closer. Cheaper land, good take-up Bina Puri (fundamental: 0.15; valuation: 1.8) appears to be the first among the four developers identified with projects in Kampung Attap, to launch its project, as it has obtained the necessary approvals. Called Opus Kuala Lumpur, the project is in Jalan Talalla and its official launch is slated for the first quarter of this year. \\u201cLand prices here are considerably cheaper. This allows for an upside for the purchasers, as opposed to the KLCC area where developers have to sell at RM1,500 psf and above to be able to make reasonable profits due to the high land cost,\\u201d says Bina Puri group executive director Matthew Tee Kai Woon, who refers to Menara Warisan Merdeka as \\u201canother new landmark instead of KLCC\\u201d. LaurelCap\\u2019s Toh says there has been no known recent vacant land transaction in the vicinity. Hence, land prices should typically be around RM300 to RM500 psf for residential use and RM500 to RM700 psf for commercial use. Salcon\\u2019s Leong is confident that the company\\u2019s project will bring good yield and give it a big boost in the property scene. \\u201cThe take-up rate is anticipated to be good due to its central location and close proximity to public transport \\u2014 there will be two MRT stations (Pasar Seni and Warisan Merdeka), a light rail transit station (Pasar Seni) and a monorail station (Jalan Maharajalela) in the vicinity, which will be convenient and attractive to tenants and patrons alike.\\u201d\n\\u00a0A development boost in and around Kampung Attap Again, because of the scarcity of land and anticipated improvement in the infrastructure, Kampung Attap is expected to welcome more property players in the near future, and with this, nearby areas will be developed, rejuvenated and refreshed. According to Toh, apart from the tract within the triangle of Jalan Kampung Attap, Jalan Belfield and Jalan Wisma Putra, it is not easy to find vacant land. He expects Menara Warisan Merdeka to have a positive impact, leading to more developments in Jalan Kampung Attap, Jalan Bellamy, Jalan Hang Tuah and Jalan Hang Jebat. He points out that there is also a car park along Jalan Balai, adjacent to the traffic police station in Jalan Tun H S Lee, which is ready for development. Redevelopment of some pre-war buildings in the Jalan Petaling area into boutique hotels and serviced apartments is also anticipated, he says. Salcon, too, foresees the regeneration of some of the older areas in the locality. As these areas develop, Previndran feels that the boon will also be in the form of an increase in property values. He opines that the main beneficiaries of the Menara Warisan Merdeka development will be the properties in Jalan Hang Jebat. He anticipates a positive impact on Chin Woo Stadium, the Malaysian Basketball Association, Methodist Boys\\u2019 School, YWCA, Olympic Council of Malaysia and Victoria Institution. \\u201cJalan Sultan and the rest of Chinatown will also benefit from the tower.\\u201d It is worth noting that the Kuala Lumpur Master Plan 2015-2025, released by the Tourism Unit of DBKL last week, has identified several areas, including Kampung Attap and Jalan Petaling, as key areas for conservation and preservation of historical buildings.

An integrated specialist technical service provider to the oil, gas and petrochemical industry, it has greater exposure to the construction of the Pengerang tank terminal project, which is set to provide earnings visibility for the firm over the next two to three years. Its prospects were boosted further after it secured RM5.5 billion worth of engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning jobs for Phase 2 of the Pengerang Terminal project on Dec 19. On the same day, it entered into an agreement with PRPC Utilities and Facilities Sdn Bhd (PRPC) and Vopak Pengerang BV to build and operate a storage hub, which is set to cost RM6.3 billion. With a huge chunk of the project going to Dialog (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 0.7), this bodes well for Dialog-WA, which expires only on Feb 10, 2017. The company-issued warrant carries a strike price of RM1.19 and a one-to-one conversion ratio. While the price of Dialog-WA had largely declined over the last six months of 2014 \\u2014 in line with the rout in oil and gas stocks \\u2014 it has swiftly recovered since the beginning of 2015. At last Tuesday\\u2019s closing of 44 sen, it has gained 14%. \\u00a0 Over the same period, Dialog\\u2019s shares have gained an equally impressive 10%, partly due to improved investor sentiment, as well as the company\\u2019s solid order book and fundamentals. It is worth noting that Dialog-WA was trading at a 1.51% discount to its underlying share as at Jan 27. Over the past year, the premium has gone down considerably, indicating that the warrant is closely tracking the performance of Dialog\\u2019s stock. Maybank IB Research has a target price of RM1.90 on Dialog\\u2019s shares, which translates into a 15% upside. Assuming zero premium, Dialog-WA would theoretically be worth 71 sen (RM1.90-RM1.19) or a 61% upside if the mother share reaches Maybank IB\\u2019s fair value. Phase 2 of the Pengerang project is a dedicated terminal with an initial capacity of 2.1 million cubic metres and 12 deepwater berths. Dialog will hold a 25% stake in the project and Petronas-owned PRPC, a 40% stake. Vopak and Johor Incorporated will own the remaining 25% and 10% respectively.

The project has been stalled since 2008. The project, called D\\u2019Rapport Residences and has a gross development value of RM3.5 billion, was originally launched in May 2008 as a profit-sharing venture with the Selangor government via Permodalan Negeri Selangor Bhd. \\u201cOur selection of CREC and Bismark as the main contractors was made based on the strength of CREC as a subsidiary of China Railway Group Ltd, which is listed on the Shanghai and Hong Kong Stock exchanges and is a Fortune 500 company,\\u201d Acmar group managing director Datuk Steven Tee told The Edge Financial Daily recently. \\u201cCREC is a well-known Asian name, therefore, we believe our D\\u2019Rapport Residences will be delivered on time and that it would be of the highest quality,\\u201d said Tee. Tee said the design of the project is backed by a team of international consultants and designers, and that the design is based on an integrated township living concept. Tee said Acmar has also secured a construction financing facility of RM476 million from Malaysia Building Society Bhd for the project, which will be situated on a 25ha plot of leasehold land on Jalan Nipah, off Jalan Ampang. The signing ceremonies to mark the appointments of the project\\u2019s main contractors and the credit facility that it has obtained will be held today. Tee said the contract, valued at RM1.065 billion, comprises the construction of five blocks of 38-storey condominium units, with a podium for recreational and sports facilities, and parking bays. The development has a gross floor area of over four million sq ft. CREC and Bismark will be paid via a RM476 million financial guarantee issued by Sabah Development Bank Bhd. Tee said the two will be paid upon the issuance of the certificate of practical completion (CPC) for the project. The balance RM589 million will be paid via units in the project. Tee said that D\\u2019Rapport will be an \\u201cawe-inspiring\\u201d vertical high-rise, with all the features and conveniences of an integrated township. \\u201cWe aim to create a city-within-a-city lifestyle for the residents, with 1,099 residential units across five towers and retail outlets at the podium, with 280,000 sq ft of recreational space,\\u201d he said. Located approximately 3km from the Kuala Lumpur City Centre, Tee said the development will offer an unobstructed view of the Petronas Twin Towers. Tee said the five blocks are only the first phase of the project, which covers less than 4ha of the total 24ha that belongs to Acmar at the site. \\u201cThe first phase will see the towers marking their presence at the embassy enclave of Ampang. The remainder of the plot will be developed later with another residential high-rise comprising six towers, a commercial/retail mall, and an office complex,\\u201d he said. The minimum price for a fully-fitted unit is expected to be about RM1.2 million. Tee said Acmar will only start selling its units after the second quarter of the year. Asked about why the project was delayed for almost seven years, Tee declined to go into details, only saying that it was problems with the previous main contractor which caused D\\u2019Rapport to be stalled. He stressed that the group did not want to see any further delays to the project, which was initially projected to be completed in 2011. On when the project would be relaunched, Tee said many expect that the property market will continue to cool this year, but noted that Acmar has the capacity to hold on to the units and sell them at a more favourable time. He said D\\u2019Rapport is part of the group\\u2019s rejuvenation as it had earlier restarted its RM350 million five-star hotel project, named Acmar Hotel and Residences, in Klang.

It is learnt that the neighbourhood mall is fetching an estimated price of RM115 million. IHC (fundamental: 0.8; valuation: 0.0) is said to be keen on buying Island Plaza mainly because the group wants to spread its wings in Malaysia. Indeed, it is in the process of setting up its business in Kuala Lumpur. IHC is expected to convert the mall into a wellness centre catering for women and children. When contacted, IHC confirmed that it is working to expand into Penang through a mall acquisition, but it decline to reveal the vendor or the mall. \\u201cWe are in negotiations with a vendor to acquire a retail mall on Penang island. Due to reasons of confidentiality, we cannot formally mention the name of the mall and the terms of the acquisition. We have not closed the deal yet, and there is still a small chance that it may not go through,\\u201d IHC vice-president for medical real estate (SEA) Liew Ed Mun tells The Edge in an email. \\u201cWe are always exploring opportunities in Malaysia and the region, and that includes Penang. When there is a suitable opportunity, we will certainly look at it. Our plans in Penang are still being finalised at this juncture. \\u201cWe will reposition the mall with a women and children-centric theme for all the medical and retail components.\\u201d He adds that it will be similar to its Kuala Lumpur city centre project. IHC\\u2019s core businesses are providing healthcare services and investing, managing and developing healthcare assets, including medical real estate, healthcare-related assets and integrated mixed-use developments. Should the deal go through, IHC is expected to invest more than RM150 million on the asset (including the purchase price and costs of refurbishment and medical equipment). It is understood that IHC\\u2019s plan is to have a mix of medical suites, medical-related and general retail components. In Kuala Lumpur, IHC is building a 33-storey mixed-used development in Jalan Kia Peng, which will feature specialist medical suites, retail space and serviced residences. It was reported that the project, with a gross floor area of 47,162 sq m, will be completed in 2017. The group has appointed Marriott International Ltd as the manager for its executive apartments. It bought the parcel of land located in the vicinity of Petronas Twin Towers in 2011 for RM81.36 million. Meanwhile, sources say the ARMF II has been looking for a buyer for Island Plaza, located in Jalan Tanjung Tokong, in the past two years. ARMF is a Pan-Asian real estate fund managed by Pramerica Real Estate Investors Ltd, the real estate investment management and advisory business of Prudential Financial Inc of the US. In August 2007, the fund bought the retail portion and unsold offices in Island Plaza for RM120 million from Belleview Group. Reports said ARMF had pumped in RM40 million to refurbish the mall back then. The building also includes an eight-storey block, called One One [email\\u00a0protected] Plaza, which comprises small offices/home offices. The acquisition of Island Plaza was part of Pramerica\\u2019s programme to invest RM1.1 billion in four shopping centres. The other three were greenfield projects \\u2014 SStwo Mall in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Ampang Mall and 1st Avenue in George Town, Penang. A combination of factors is said to have contributed to Island Plaza losing its appeal among retailers and shoppers. Among them is that it is a strata property, hence there are difficulties in managing tenancy portfolio. Furthermore, shoppers are drawn to new and larger malls nearby, such as Gurney Plaza Extension and Straits Quay.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Repositioning Island Plaza is possibly a move in the right direction and may turn around its fortunes. After all, Penang is well known for its medical tourism. \\u00a0 In 2013, some 770,000 foreign patients contributed US$200 million (RM716 million) in revenue to the country. Traditionally, Penang accounts for over half the country\\u2019s medical tourism earnings. Pramerica\\u2019s funds have been trying to divest their assets. SStwo Mall is expected to undergo a makeover after failed attempts to dispose of it. It is understood that it is likely to be partially demolished and its retail space reduced. It will also see the addition of serviced apartments. Another Pramerica-linked mall that was put up for sale was Seremban Prima, previously known as Seremban Parade. In 2011, TMW Asia Property Fund 1, a German-based property fund also managed by Pramerica, tried to sell three malls \\u2014 Klang Parade, Ipoh Parade and Seremban Parade \\u2014 to ARA Asia Dragon Fund (an affiliate of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing\\u2019s Cheung Kong Group). However, the deal to dispose of Seremban Parade fell through. TMW acquired the three malls from the Lion Group for an estimated RM340 million in 2005. Then, Pramerica partnered Allstones Group Asia Sdn Bhd to undertake an asset enhancement exercise to reposition Seremban Parade. Some RM70 million (including the retail tenants\\u2019 portion) was invested and the exercise was completed in the third quarter of 2013. It was renamed Seremban Prima. In 2006, Pramerica bought Kinta City Shopping Centre and last September, it acquired KL Festival City from Parkson Holdings for RM349 million.

The ringgit has already fallen sharply in the past month, hit by a double whammy. Firstly, with the US economy gaining traction \\u2014 and feeding expectations of higher interest rates \\u2014 there is a rush of capital back to the greenback. The unwinding of foreign shareholdings in Malaysian Government Securities (MGS), thus far, may just be the tip of the iceberg. \\u00a0 As a net exporter of oil and gas, Malaysia is seen as a loser from the steep drop in oil prices, which may have more room to fall before stabilising. And even then, prices may stay low for a considerable period amid rising global supply and sluggish demand. And then there are domestic dampers to consider, such as the looming Goods and Services Tax (GST) as well as high government and household indebtedness. The impact from the confluence of all these factors is yet to be definitively assessed, quantified or addressed by the government. And this will be reflected in corporate earnings growth, which has been dismal in the past three straight years \\u2014 hovering in the low single digit. 2015 will be worse! In sum, they all point to a difficult year ahead, marked by falling stocks and property prices. Against such a challenging backdrop, we have carefully selected 10 stocks that we believe will outperform the market. They may even make money in a broadly falling market. There is a common thread amongst all these companies \\u2014 they have sustainable business models, good growth prospects, improving productivity and strong balance sheets. In fact, all of our selected stocks are in net cash position save for Complete Logistic Services, which is just marginally in debt. In an environment of tightening liquidity and rising interest rates \\u2014 yields on MGS suggest costs are already rising even if Bank Negara Malaysia stands pat on rates \\u2014 having cash in hand is, often, half the battle won. Of note, all of the above-mentioned criteria are encapsulated in The Edge Research\\u2019s Fundamental Score, which ranges from 0 to 3, with 3 being the best. The Edge Research also has a Valuation Score, which rates the valuation attractiveness of each listed company, on both Bursa Malaysia and SGX, on a similar scale. These scores and much more are available, for free, at theedgemarkets.com \\u2014 to help you make better decisions. The companies on our Top 10 list have Fundamental Scores ranging from 1.95 to 3, with an average of 2.5, and a Valuation Score average of 2.1. Many of our selected companies are exporters that will benefit from the weak ringgit as well as manufacturers that will gain from low commodity prices, possibly for an extended period. The biggest driver in the commodity market, China, is slowing after years of hyper-growth, damping demand. At the same time, high prices of the past decade have led to capacity expansions, which are now translating into excess supply in many market segments. The weather has also been kind to crops, resulting in bumper harvests for many including soybean and corn. Plastic manufacturers (SCGM and Thong Guan) will benefit from lower resin prices \\u2014 which closely track the oil market \\u2014 while industrial rubber hose manufacturer, WellCall is gaining from falling rubber raw material costs. All are exporters, as is furniture manufacturer, Homeritz. Incidentally, SCADA systems/solutions provider Willowglen\\u2019s main market is Singapore. There are sectors we avoided. One is, clearly, oil & gas. Whilst some may argue stocks are oversold, it is way too early to quantify the depth of capital spending cuts by oil majors. Plantation will see continued pressure on crude palm oil (CPO) prices, with falling oil prices (that will hurt biodiesel demand) and ample supply of edible oils globally. Banks, meanwhile, are looking at slower loans growth and may be vulnerable to higher non-performing loans if operating conditions deteriorate. Property too is expected to slow down, with tighter mortgage lending, oversupply in certain segments and likely, rising interest rates. This will, to a certain degree, also affect the construction and building materials sectors. But continued government spending on infrastructure projects should temper the negative impact. OKA, Pintaras and Complete Logistic Services are expected to benefit from the latter. To round up our Top 10 selection, we have thrown in two relatively defensive, high-yielding consumer-related companies. Panamy has a strong brand name and net cash worth almost half of its market capitalisation while Cocoaland has made quite a footprint in regional markets.  Cocoaland Holdings Bhd Cocoaland is our top pick in the consumer sector. We like the company for its resilient business model - high volume fast-selling candies at affordable prices, strong brand names, capable management, undemanding valuations and high growth potential. The Edge Research rates Cocoaland Fundamental and Valuation scores of 2.1 and 2.4 out of 3, respectively. The company is a leader in the fruit gummy market, which accounts for 35% of sales. As the sole producer of fruit gummies in Malaysia, it commands a high margin of about 20%. With exports accounting for 61% of sales, Cocoaland will also benefit from the strengthening US dollar. The company spent RM135 million on capex, all internally funded, over the last four years. It expanded production capacity for fruit gummy by 160% while warehouse capacity increased by 64%. Despite the huge capex, its balance sheet stayed strong with net cash of RM23.9 million - underscoring Cocoaland's steady operating cash flow.\\u00a0\\u00a0 The stock is trading at a trailing 12-month P/E of 13.1 times and P/BV of 1.2 times. These valuations are inexpensive for a consumer company with strong, growing brands. Dividends totalled 6.5 sen per share in 2013, translating into a net yield of 4.2%.  Complete Logistic Services Bhd \\u00a0 The current environment of weak oil prices should boost the bottom line of Complete Logistic Services (CLS), fuel being a key cost component for the comprehensive logistics services provider. The Klang-based company owns a fleet of eight ships and over 200 trucks. CLS shifted its focus from shipping to land logistics after competition in the former intensified. Consequently, revenue from land logistics segment grew steadily, at CAGR of 19% from RM27 million in FY March 2007 to RM94 million in FY2014, contributing 77% of revenue and 70% of PAT in FY2014. Since downsizing its vessel fleet, the company acquired land in Klang to expand its warehousing activities to the West Port area. It is now also an operator in the Nilai Inland Port, offering an exposure to the growing industrial base in the area. The Edge Research rates CLS a Fundamental score of 2.5 out of 3. Operating cash flows have been positive since listing in 2007. Balance sheet is healthy with net gearing of just 0.04%. The stock is trading at a trailing 12-month P/E of 7.8 times and a P/BV of 0.8 times. CLS paid interim dividend of 3 sen per share in FY2015, translating into a yield of 4.3%.  Homeritz Corporation Bhd Homeritz Corporation is a manufacturer of upholstered home furniture - dining chairs, sofas and bed frames - under Original Design (including its own brand, Eritz) and Original Equipment Manufacturer. About 99.3% of its products are sold overseas. Key markets are Asia, Australia, Europe and the US, with receivables mostly in US dollars. The stock looks attractive for its exposure to the strengthening US dollar, high dividend yield and steady growth. From FY August 2011 to FY2014, revenue has grown 41.6% from RM89.8 million to RM127.2 million while net profit increased by 87.3% from RM10.8 million to RM20.3 million. Operating margins have been expanding on economies of scale and increased productivity and efficiency. Management is also upbeat on demand outlook. The stock trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 8.5 times, low relative to its growth. Its balance sheet has net cash of RM49.3 million. This is about 24.6 sen per share or 28.6% of the current share price of 0.86 sen. Lastly, Homeritz has a minimum 40% dividend payout policy. Dividends totalled 5.1 sen per share in FY2014, translating into a net yield of 5.93%. The Edge Research has given Homeritz Valuation and Fundamental scores of 2.40 and 1.95.  OKA Corporation Bhd Ipoh-based OKA Corp - one of the largest pre-cast concrete manufacturers in Malaysia - stands out for its consistent earnings, low valuations and higher-than-market average yields. Having supplied to projects including East Coast Expressway, MRT and LRT, as well as the Pasir Panjang Terminal in Singapore, OKA is well-positioned to benefit from future infrastructure projects such as the MRT 2, LRT 3 and West Coast Expressway. OKA charted steady revenue growth, from RM103 million in FY March 2010 to RM145.4 million in FY2014. Net margins were fairly consistent in the earlier years but widened to 9.2% in FY2013-FY2014. The uptrend continued into 1HFY2015 with net margin expanding further to 10%, thanks to rising utilisation and economies of scale, cost control and improving balance sheet. As gearing declined from a high of 21.8% in FY2012 to current net cash of RM1 million, so did interest expenses. The Edge Research rates it a maximum Valuation score of 3.0 and 2.2 for Fundamentals. It is trading at just 0.89 times book and trailing 12-month P/E of 6.6 times. Additionally, OKA pays consistent dividends, between 3-3.5 sen per share over the last 5 years. Dividends for FY2014 totalled 3 sen per share, giving a net yield of 4.3%.  Panasonic Manufacturing Malaysia Bhd Panamy, which manufactures a wide range of electrical appliances under brand Panasonic, is an attractively priced company with stable, steadily growing earnings and strong balance sheet. Between FY March 2010 and FY2014, turnover rose a compounded 7.2% per annum while net profit grew 5.6% annually. The Edge Research rates it a 2.4 and 2.8 out of 3 for Valuation and Fundamental, respectively. High dividend yields and a well-established brand presence in Malaysia are definite plus points. The company, which has ridden through multiple financial crises in the past, should be well able to weather what is expected to be a very challenging 2015. It is sitting on net cash totalling RM536 million. Panamy has, historically, rewarded its shareholders well, with special, interim and final dividends. Total dividends of 69.2 sen per share for FY2014, however, were considerably lower compared to the RM1.41 for FY2013. Even so, this still translates to a yield of 3.7% based on the current share price of RM18.50. A possible reason for the lower dividend could be expectations of further weakening of the Japanese yen. If so, we could see higher dividends in the near future.  Pintaras Jaya Bhd Within the construction sector, Pintaras - a leading foundations and piling specialist \\u00ad- stands out for its consistent earnings growth, high margins and net cash of RM140.3 million. The Edge Research rates it a maximum Fundamental Score of 3.0. The company is currently running at full capacity up to mid-2015. Its orderbook includes the iconic 118-storey Warisan Merdeka. Piling, civil engineering and construction works accounted for 82% of sales in FY June 2014 - and more importantly, earns a smart 35% margin, well above the average construction sector margin of around 10%. Pintaras attributes this to a confluence of factors. It is a specialist in a niche market. It is very selective when it comes to which project to take on. In particular, the company selects only those that maximise utilisation of its existing fleet of heavy equipment. And after being in the business for 25 years, many of its equipment are already fully depreciated. It has a good track record and reputation and hence, is able to procure materials at attractive terms. Dividends totalled 15 sen in FY2014, giving a yield of 4.0%. The stock is trading at 1.88 times book with a trailing 12-month P/E of 10.9 times.  SCGM Bhd SCGM is involved in, primarily, the manufacture of thermo-vacuum formed plastic packing - basically, disposal plastic trays for the food and beverage, electronics & electrical and medical sectors. Aside from growing demand, the company will benefit from lower raw material cost for plastic resin. As an exporter - sales to Asia, Europe, Oceania and North America accounted for 44% of sales in FY April 2014 - SCGM will also gain from the weak ringgit. From FY2010 to FY2014, revenue and net profit grew at CAGR of 10.3% and 14.6%, respectively. For the latest 1QFY2015, net profit grew an outsized 13.3% on 6% revenue increase. Net margin widened to 13% from an average of 11.5% in FY2014, boosted by lower raw material cost, increased production and economies of scale. The company is adding a new plastic cup line that will lift capacity and sales by some 10% next year and planning further automation to improve efficiency. The Edge Research rates SCGM a high Fundamental score of 3 out of 3 and Valuation score of 2.1 out of 3. The stock is trading at a trailing 12 month P/E of 12.4 times with ROE of 17.7%. It has a minimum 40% dividend payout policy. Yields totalled 5.2% in FY2014.  Thong Guan Industries Bhd The slump in crude oil prices - and therefore lower resin raw material costs - coupled with the weakening ringgit are expected to be a boon for Thong Guan. The company is one of Asia-Pacific's largest producers of plastic packaging, including thin stretch film, garbage bags, PVC food wraps and industrial film. Exports - to Japan, Australia, China and Asean - accounted for nearly three-quarters of sales in 2013. To cater to future demand growth, it has committed to spend RM100 million - to expand capacity for various product lines, focusing on high margin segments. Annual production capacity is slated to rise by 42% to 170,000 tonnes within the next three years. Currently, Thong Guan is running at 90% utilisation. The Edge Research rates Thong Guan an above-average Fundamental score of 2.1 and Valuation score of 1.8 out of a maximum 3.0. The stock is trading at a steep 35% discount to its book value of RM2.87. Trailing 12-month P/E is only 7.1 times - low relative to its prospective growth. It has zero gearing and ROE of nearly 10%. Dividends were raised from 6 sen in 2011 to 8 sen per share in 2013, translating into attractive net yield of 4.3%.  WellCall Holdings Bhd Ipoh-based WellCall manufactures industrial rubber hoses used across a broad swath of the economy - for air and water, welding and gas, oil and fuel, automobile, shipbuilding as well as food & beverage sectors. Earnings grew steadily for the past four years. In FY September 2013, WellCall saw lower revenue - as customers held back purchases in anticipation of lower prices - but still managed to grow profits, thanks to lower rubber costs. In the latest FY2014, both sales and net profit rose - by 11.3% to RM146.4 million and 19.1% to RM29.4 million, respectively. The current regime of low commodity prices and weak ringgit bodes well for WellCall. Almost 91% of sales are exported, to all over the world. Meanwhile, bulk latex prices have fallen from 536 sen/kg at end-2013 to the current 358 sen/kg. The Edge Research rates WellCall a maximum Fundamental score of 3 and 2.1 out of 3 for Valuation. The company is sitting on net cash of RM41 million, which together with steady operating cash flow will continue to support a generous dividend payout. Annual dividends paid have been in a gradual uptrend, net yield totalled 5.35% in FY2014. ROE has been rising steadily, from 20% in FY2011 to over 35% currently.  Willowglen MSC Bhd A company that stands to benefit from government infrastructure spending is Willowglen - a leading Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system provider. The development of mega projects and high-rise buildings in Klang Valley and Johor is likely to provide more business opportunities for its SCADA business. Its main markets are Singapore and Malaysia, contributing 83% and 17%, respectively, of its FY2013 revenue. Willowglen is well established in Singapore and its major clients include Housing and Development Board of Singapore (HDB), Singapore Power and Public Utilities Board of Singapore, Prasarana Malaysia and Petronas Gas. Besides a growing SCADA market, Willowglen is fundamentally sound - The Edge Research gives it a Fundamental Score of 2.55 out of 3. Revenue grew at 3-year CAGR of 23.5% from RM54.5 million in 2010 to RM102.6 million in 2013 with consistent EBITDA margin of 20%. Supported by strong cash flows, its net cash stood at RM55.9 million or 23 sen per share as at end-September 2014, up from RM37.7 million in 2010. The stock is trading at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 10.0 times and a P/BV of 1.97 times. Dividend per share was 2 sen in 2013, translating into a yield of 2.7%.

It said the key drivers of its decision are: the government\\u2019s intention to adhere to its policy of deficit reduction and the resistance of Malaysia\\u2019s fundamental credit strengths \\u2014 notably macroecnomic stability, domestic capital market depth and a favourable government debt structure \\u2014 to global financial market volatility. \\u201cWe have seen on-going fiscal deficit reduction and actual implementation of significant reforms, [but] the external challenges faced by the country have risen. Consequently, Moody\\u2019s has affirmed Malaysia at A3 and maintains a positive outlook on the rating,\\u201d it added. \\u201cThe effectiveness of Malaysia's policy response in the year ahead, to challenges already evident \\u2014 namely, lower global crude oil prices and lackluster global growth \\u2014 and to those challenges that are expected \\u2014 namely the normalisation of interest rates by the US Federal Reserve \\u2014 will influence the future trajectory of Malaysia's sovereign rating,\\u201d it further opined. It noted the government has set in place the necessary infrastructure to implement the Goods and Services Tax in April 2015. The new tax will bolster revenue over and above the sales and services taxes that it replaces, partly through improved compliance. \\u201cLower oil prices present potential downside risks to continued strong fiscal performance. The government's ability to continue to meet or exceed fiscal targets in a low oil price environment, will be a key consideration in lifting the sovereign's rating,\\u201d it said. It noted the government has recently responded to the potential revenue impact from lower oil prices, by implementing cuts to operating expenditure, which it said demonstrated a commitment to fiscal consolidation and to meeting prevailing fiscal rules. \\u201cHowever, the full impact of the oil market shock \\u2014 and the potential for further shocks \\u2014 will not be known for some time, because a significant proportion of hydrocarbon revenues are derived from liquefied natural gas, the price of which tends to adjust relatively slowly, owing to the long-term nature of supply contracts,\\u201d it noted. Moody\\u2019s added it expects the stability of dividend payments by Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) and expenditure rationalisation to continue to keep the government\\u2019s operation balance in surplus, and its stock of debt under 55% of the gross domestic product (GDP). It added that Bank Negara\\u2019s solid track record of maintaining low inflation and a stable financial system, continues to anchor the macroeconomic stability of the country. \\u201cContinued fiscal consolidation, underpinned by relatively strong economic growth and favorable funding conditions for the government, potentially supports a higher rating level,\\u201d it said.

For its 3QFY14 results announcement, the group saw its nine-month (9MFY14) accumulated profit improve. Petra Energy\\u2019s revenue rose 25% to RM417 million in 9MFY14 from RM333.4 million in 9MFY13, while profit before tax expanded correspondingly by 15.8% to RM19.8 million in 9MFY14 from RM17.1 million in 9MFY13. According to Petra Energy\\u2019s announcement, the strong improvement in profitability was attributed to positive contribution from the integrated brownfield maintenance and engineering services segment.\\u00a0 Overall, Petra Energy may have improved its profitability in FY14 but investors seem to have taken a more macro approach and discounted the improved profitability as falling crude oil prices and the weak outlook for the oil and gas industry continue to cast a bearish outlook for the sector.\\u00a0 A check of the Bloomberg consensus reveals that three research houses cover Petra Energy, with a \\u201chold\\u201d call, a \\u201cbuy\\u201d and a \\u201csell\\u201d call. This stock currently trades at a price-earnings ratio of 15.8 times while its price-to-book value ratio of 0.84 times indicates that its share price is trading at a slight discount to its book value. Petra Energy\\u2019s chart trend, on daily, weekly and monthly time frames, is very firmly down. Its share price has made a large decline since its major daily Wave-5 and recent high of RM3.16 in June 2014. Since that RM3.16 high, Petra Energy fell to its January 2015 recent low of RM1.32. As prices broke below their recent key critical support levels of RM2.38 and RM1.98, look to sell Petra Energy on any rebounds to its resistance areas as the MAs depict very firm short- to long-term downtrends for this stock.\\u00a0 The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD and Stochastic) have issued sell signals and now depict very firm indications of Petra Energy\\u2019s eventual move towards much lower levels. It would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of RM1.33, RM1.98 and RM2.38. We expect Petra Energy to witness weak buying interest at its support levels of RM1.19, RM1.25 and RM1.30. Its downside targets are at RM1.31, RM0.80 and RM0.21.

Under the revised Budget 2015 announced by Najib last Tuesday, the government is seeking an additional RM400 million in dividends from GLCs and GLICs to help supplement its revenue amid falling crude oil prices. On the macro front, the government\\u2019s urge for more dividends from such institutions would help shore up investors\\u2019 interests, said Areca Capital Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Danny Wong. \\u201cWith the government calling for more dividends, this could also hopefully attract foreign funds and indirectly help ease the burden of the weaker ringgit,\\u201d Wong told The Edge Financial Daily. However, JF Apex Securities Bhd senior analyst Lee Cherng Wee said whether GLCs could pay more dividends would ultimately depend on their ability to grow earnings substantially amid a tougher economic climate. Already, many research houses are forecasting a mere single-digit corporate earnings growth this year.\\u00a0 CIMB Research, for one, is projecting 8% growth in Malaysia\\u2019s corporate earnings in 2015, a figure that is nothing to shout about given the projected inflation rate as high as 4% this year, with the impending implementation of the goods and services tax. \\u201cIf earnings don\\u2019t grow as much, GLCs would then have to increase their payout ratios in response to the government\\u2019s needs,\\u201d said a head of research.  \\u201cSome of the GLCs have big capital expenditure (capex) requirements but if the government asked them to pay more dividends, they will still have to oblige,\\u201d he added, citing the case of Petroliam Nasional Bhd. While the national oil firm\\u2019s management had expressed its reservations on raising dividends, the government has repeatedly \\u201creminded\\u201d the former that it makes the ultimate decision on the level of dividends that the national oil firm has to pay. Looking at the list of selected GLCs (see table), most have retained earnings that are multifold of their 12-month trailing net profit.\\u00a0 An analyst pointed out that S P Setia Bhd, in which Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) is the major shareholder, is capable of paying a bigger dividend, as there is no major land banking exercise in store in its financial year ending Oct 31, 2015 (FY15). \\u201cS P Setia has no big plans so far,\\u201d said the analyst. The property developer (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 1.2) has a dividend policy of distributing at least 50% of its net profit, with its dividend of 9.7 sen per share in FY14 accounting for about 60% of its earnings per share. With retained earnings that were four times its FY14 net profit of RM405.68 million and no major land acquisitions announced, the group looks to be able to distribute more dividends, some said. Meanwhile, another of PNB\\u2019s listed conglomerates, Sime Darby Bhd (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.3), has retained earnings of RM28.9 billion, which is 8.59 times its trailing 12-month net profit of RM3.36 billion. In addition, its net gearing level is also low at 0.23 times. Sime Darby has a pending deal to acquire New Britain Palm Oil Ltd for some RM5.63 billion. But after this, analysts don\\u2019t expect a major acquisition by the group, at least in the short term. Nevertheless, weak palm oil prices and the slowdown in its China vehicle distribution business may dent Sime Darby\\u2019s profitability and crimp its dividends, some said. AllianceDBS Research, in a note last Friday, said companies owned by Khazanah Nasional Bhd are more likely to be the ones asked to pay more dividends, compared with other GLCs that are largely owned by trust funds managed by PNB or the Employees Provident Fund. \\u201cIn 2013, Khazanah contributed RM650 million in dividends to the government. This suggests that dividends from Khazanah will need to be ramped up significantly in order to achieve the [additional] RM400 million target,\\u201d said the research house in the note. AllianceDBS believes the four GLCs that could give out more dividends are Axiata Group Bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 0.9), Time DotCom Bhd (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 0.6), Petronas Gas Bhd (PetGas) (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 0.9), and MISC Bhd (fundamental: 1.6; valuation: 1.8).\\u00a0 Axiata and Time are majority owned by Khazanah, while PetGas and MISC are majority owned by Petronas. \\u201cBased on our analysis, Axiata is likely to be the major contributor as it has the capacity to raise its payout ratio from 80% (our current estimate) to 100%, given its strong free cash flow from Malaysian operations. If this happens, this will raise RM205 million in additional dividends for Khazanah,\\u201d AllianceDBS explained. JF Apex\\u2019s Lee, who tracks telecommunications stocks, said telcos will have to balance between dividend payout and allocation for their capex. \\u201cTelcos have high capex commitments because they have to build infrastructure. For Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), should it get the government\\u2019s go-ahead to start its second phase of high-speed broadband this year, its cash might be constrained by the huge capex,\\u201d he said. Like Axiata, TM is majority owned by Khazanah. Telcos are seen as dividend-seekers\\u2019 favourites due to their stable earnings and generous payout ratios, although currently their yields are in the range of just 4%. Khazanah owns 28.73% of TM (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 0.9) and 37.89% of Axiata. In the past four financial quarters, TM paid out a dividend of 25.8 sen per share, which is nearly 97% of its earnings per share of 26.61 sen in the same period. Currently, TM has a policy of paying out either RM700 million or a maximum of 90% of its net profit, whichever is higher. Either way, TM\\u2019s dividend payout has a limit and is constrained by its performance. Back to Petronas-owned listed companies, while they might be facing earnings headwinds given the depressed crude oil prices, they are lowly geared.\\u00a0 Two of them, PetGas and Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd (PChem), are in net cash positions. However, AllianceDBS said that both PetGas and PChem (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 1.2) might be constrained by capex requirements for the Pengerang regasification terminal project and the Refinery And Petrochemical Integrated Development. While no GLC has come out since to declare bumper dividends or bigger payouts, many of the blue-chips have seen their share prices move up.\\u00a0 Between last Tuesday and Friday, Axiata rose 22 sen or 3.15% to RM7.21; Sime Darby gained 27 sen or 2.91% to RM9.56; Petronas Dagangan Bhd jumped 86 sen or 5.27% to RM17.18; and PetGas, meanwhile, rose 96 sen or 4.49% to RM22.36. Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB), majority owned by Khazanah, was also instrumental in lifting the benchmark index back to the 1,800 level last week.\\u00a0 Save for last Tuesday, the utility giant was consistently in the top gainers rank and it closed the week 60 sen or 4.14% higher to record a fresh high of RM15.10. While TNB (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1) has reported a 34% jump in its net profit for the first quarter ended Nov 30, 2014 and is expected to deliver record earnings due to lower coal cost and a tariff hike last year, analysts said it might be needing cash for its new power plants, hence potentially capping its dividend payout.  \nThe Edge Research\\u2019s fundamental score reflects a company\\u2019s profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers.

While the project timeline is uncertain (within the two years), the management guides that the risk of such projects being uneconomical will only be if crude oil price dips further below US$25 (RM89) to US$30 per barrel. Hence, should Brent crude oil prices stabilise at US$50 per barrel, work will continue. Uzma\\u2019s business could slow down in financial year 2015 (FY15), given Petronas\\u2019 potential operating expenditure cuts (on top of capital expenditure announced previously).

Our TP is maintained at RM2.02 pegged to nine times FY15 forward price-earnings ratio (PER), which is in-line with small-cap oil and gas (O&G) peers\\u2019 valuations.

The local benchmark FBM KLCI was down 10.34% for the year (as at Dec 16), reflecting investors\\u2019 deep concerns about the adverse impact of oil prices on federal government revenue, which is closely tied to oil receipts. Expectations of a prolonged period of cheap oil will also dent capital spending by Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas), which local oil and gas firms are largely reliant on. The present circumstances do not bode well for the listed oil and gas firms which, unsurprisingly, make up six of the 20 worst-performing stocks on Bursa Malaysia\\u2019s Main Market this year. Notably, offshore vessel operators and drilling rig companies were among those worst hit, with big names such as SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd, Perisai Petroleum Teknologi Bhd and Alam Maritim Resources Bhd in the top decliners list (see accompanying table).  As Brent crude prices shed 40% year-to-date (as at Dec 16), Malaysian oil and gas stocks experienced even greater declines, the biggest of which was Perisai, which lost 74% of its value. Similarly, upstream players such as SapuraKencana and Alam Maritim saw their share prices decline by 57% and 66% over the same period. Isolated from crumbling oil prices, however, sportswear manufacturer Xidelang Holdings Ltd turned out to be the worst performing stock on Bursa this year, with the stock falling by 80%. The extreme decline came as Xidelang reported sharply lower profit in the third quarter ended Sept 30, as sales slowed in mainland China due to stiff competition, as well as on lower demand. On the other hand, the 20 top performing stocks on Bursa\\u2019s Main Market for the year are companies that experienced major shareholding changes as well as mergers and acquisitions activity. For instance, Damansara Realty Bhd and Lay Hong Bhd saw takeover offers by their respective major shareholders, Seaview Holdings Sdn Bhd and QL Resources Bhd, at a substantial premium to market prices. Interestingly, developer Perduren (M) Bhd had become the object of takeovers twice in 2014, first by its substantial shareholder Tan Sri David Law in January, and recently by parties led by Datuk Kamaluddin Abdullah. Meanwhile, firms such as Takaso Resources Bhd have attracted interest by venturing into the construction industry via the acquisition of a private entity, in this case, Dynavance Construction Sdn Bhd. Nevertheless, ACE Market-listed software firm IFCA MSC Bhd is the clear winner for the year, with its stock gaining 670% to date. The IT firm, with its GST-related software offerings, was one of the main beneficiaries of the impending implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on April 1. Notably, private investor Brahmal Vasudevan, who runs private equity firm Creador, made major gains from his investments in three technology firms that were among Bursa\\u2019s top gainers over the year \\u2014 IFCA MSC, SMRT Holdings Bhd and Scicom (MSC) Bhd. Among ACE market counters, technology firms dominate the top rankings, possibly due to favourable sentiment towards the local software industry as well as GST. Aside from IFCA MSC, other technology firms among the best performing ACE market stocks include SMRT Holdings (software consultancy), MMS Ventures Bhd (industrial automation) and Nova MSC Bhd (e-business solutions). Outside Malaysia In what was a challenging year for equity markets in developed countries, Asian stocks managed to deliver the biggest returns globally, with 19 making up the world\\u2019s top 30 gainers. The number one stock, Thailand\\u2019s Asset Bright Plc, gained more than 3,000% this year. The company has dual exposure in the real estate and e-commerce businesses in Thailand. As with last year, European stocks continued to disappoint, with only four companies making the top 30. Likewise, only one company listed in the US made the cut, in spite of the Dow Jones and S&P 500 hitting all-time highs this year. Eight companies from India made the list, largely due to newly elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\u2019s pro-business approach. Modi had proposed a slew of financial reforms as well as new measures to streamline India\\u2019s bloated bureaucracy with the intention of boosting local businesses. Overall, stocks with strong fundamentals were the clear winners this year compared with growth stocks whose earnings have underperformed previously lofty expectations. This is evident in the sheer number of manufacturing firms that make up the top global gainers list, riding on the better economic prospects in the US, the largest consumer market in the world.

At its latest price, Bumi Armada is valued at 14.86 times its estimated earnings for FY2014 ending Dec 31 while for Yinson, it is 23.24 times its estimated earnings for FY2015 ending Jan 31. Analysts attribute Bumi Armada\\u2019s descent to its relatively high and mature earnings base and credit Yinson\\u2019s resilience to its still intact growth potential. Because it started from a low base, Yinson is expected to see stronger cash flow and earnings over the next two financial years as it reaps the full benefits of existing contracts and new ones that have been secured but have yet to commence. Speculation that Yinson is soon to ink another huge FPSO contract in West Africa has also bolstered its share price. This is aside from recent news that its 30%-owned unit Yinson Energy Sdn Bhd has received three licences from Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas), which could open up fresh opportunities. Nevertheless, as Bumi Armada\\u2019s shares tumble, investors have begun to view it as oversold. After all, the group did have a strong order book of about RM21.7 billion as at June. Some also believe the hiring of a new CEO to succeed the long-serving Hassan Assad Basma, who suddenly announced his resignation effective Jan 1, 2015, could attract investors and lift the stock. Perhaps a bigger boost could be a potential mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deal involving Bumi Armada. The Edge Financial Daily last Friday quoted sources as saying that tycoon T Ananda Krishnan is looking to divest his 34.9% stake in the company and that some local oil and gas service companies had been approached for a possible deal. A source tells The Edge that if the tycoon cannot find a buyer at a satisfying price, and if Bumi Armada\\u2019s shares continue to weaken, he would most likely take the group private again, as he did in 2003 when the market was tough. \\u201cAnother option for A K is to restructure or merge it with another oil and gas company,\\u201d the source adds. Indeed, Ananda has a penchant for taking his companies private and relisting them later as bigger entities with higher valuations. After delisting Bumi Armada in 2003, he did it to mobile operator Maxis Communications in 2007 (relisted its local business in 2009) and pay-TV operator Astro All Asia Networks in 2010 (relisted in 2012). After about a decade at the helm of Bumi Armada, Hassan\\u2019s resignation during a delicate period for the oil and gas industry has left the company with big shoes to fill. Although Hassan will continue to be engaged as a consultant by Bumi Armada until mid-2016, it will be interesting to see who takes up the challenge as the group\\u2019s new CEO in the current low oil price environment. Bumi Armada started to go downhill in May after it reported a 40% drop in net profit to RM64.8 million in its first quarter ended March 31, 2014. Revenue fell slightly to RM468.9 million from RM488.8 million previously. The company attributed the reduced earnings to lower utilisation of its offshore support vessels \\u2014 a segment with an oversupply of assets \\u2014 as well as slower activity in its transport and installation segment due to winter conditions. The disappointing results were also due to a change in the company\\u2019s accounting treatment \\u2014 changing \\u201coperating lease\\u201d to \\u201cfinance lease\\u201d \\u2014 that is said to be a more prudent and conservative method. This change was sudden, causing speculation that the group might be facing problems at its African operation. However, in a previous interview with The Edge, Hassan explained that the change in accounting treatment was to enable the company to take on larger-scale FPSO projects, which had different requirements. Bumi Armada has been expanding its fleet in Africa and currently has 11 vessels in Nigeria, 6 in Angola and 5 in Congo. Meantime, following the plunge in its share price, analysts have seen value emerging in Bumi Armada. According to Bloomberg, the stock has 14 \\u201cbuy\\u201d, 4 \\u201chold\\u201d and 2 \\u201csell\\u201d calls. \\u00a0 \\u201cOperationally, we like Bumi Armada\\u2019s FPSO business model in the light of the current weak or volatile oil market environment. Its contracts are firm with favourable termination clauses and minimal speculative building. Valuation-wise, Bumi Armada is inexpensive. We are not ruling out a potential privatisation of the stock for it is trading at sub-1 times book value,\\u201d says Maybank Investment Bank Research in a recent report. It has a target price of RM2.05 on the stock. At RM1.16, Bumi Armada is valued at a 26% discount to its net asset value per share of RM1.57 as at Nov 30. Meanwhile, Yinson has been climbing the ladder steadily. In terms of fleet size, it is just two vessels behind Bumi Armada, which has five FPSOs and two under construction while it has four FPSOs and one under construction. Yinson\\u2019s acquisition of Norwegian FPSO player Fred Olsen Production ASA (FOP) for US$165.6 million late last year has served as a game-changer for the company. The acquisition was funded by borrowings and a share placement that brought in high-profile strategic investors \\u2014 Tan Sri Mokhzani Mahathir and his partner and veteran oil and gas player K C Yeow. The FOP buy and the entry of Mokhzani and Yeow helped Yinson garner strong investor interest. It spiked to an all-time high of RM3.47 on Sept 15 before surrendering some gains to close at RM2.67 last Friday. Yinson has an order book of US$3.7 billion (RM12.86 billion), which is expected to last it until 2023. The group, having leveraged FOP\\u2019s strong presence in West Africa, is the leading contender for the Offshore Cape Three Points FPSO project off the coast of Ghana. In FY2014 ended Jan 31, the group\\u2019s net profit doubled to RM69.8 million from the year before while revenue nearly breached the RM1 billion mark at RM941.9 million. Its total assets grew to RM2.1 billion from RM800.9 million previously. According to Bloomberg, consensus has forecast a net profit of RM119 million in FY2015 (its 6MFY2015 net profit as at July 31 had already hit RM61 million) and RM137 million in FY2016, indicating strong growth ahead. According to theedgemarkets.com, Bumi Armada has a valuation score of 0.6 while Yinson has 1.5. The score provides a composite measure of historical returns and valuation on a scale of 0 to 3, with 3 suggesting that a company gives higher than average market returns and is trading at a lower than average valuation.

PKR secretary-general Rafizi Ramli said that rather than having to buy fuel wholesale, it would be more equitable for the stations if a consignment system was adopted, as seen in countries such as Australia and South Africa. Then station operators will not have to pay up front to giant oil companies for fuel. Currently as \\u201cagents\\u201d, they are only paid a commission by the oil companies based on the volume of sales. Under the current wholesale system, oil companies such as Petronas, Shell, Petron and BHP require that petrol stations buy stock in cash that is at least three days\\u2019 worth of their sales at any given time. This exposes the station operators to losses when oil prices go down, as they buy their stocks of petrol and diesel at a higher price. \\u201c[In] the consignment system, the financial risks faced by operators are removed. The petrol prices can also be revised frequently without any financial impact on key stakeholders,\\u201d Rafizi said in a statement. Rafizi warned that petrol station operators are at risk of closing down under the automatic price mechanism Putrajaya uses to fix the retail price of petrol and diesel, saying that at current pump prices retailers would have racked up losses of up to RM15,000. They will have to bear these losses for the rest of the month, and run the risk of debt snowballing, owing to the higher price they paid to petrol companies. Rafizi said by implementing the consignment system, the excuse that fuel prices cannot be revised on a weekly basis no longer exists. Putrajaya resisted calls for weekly revisions of petrol and fuel pump prices despite the continued plunge in global oil prices (which have reached below US$50 (RM178.50) a barrel this week, and is expected to be at US$40 a barrel by the end of the month). It removed fuel subsidies early this month due to the tumbling of global oil prices and set up a managed float pricing system where prices would be set on a monthly average price. The price would be announced at the end of each month for the following month. Rafizi said that with weekly revisions, RON95 petrol might reach RM1.40 a litre by the end of January, as opposed to RM1.91 a litre that consumers are forking out this month. \\u201cWeekly price reviews of petrol and diesel prices will see it fluctuate according to market prices, and Barisan Nasional can no longer collect billions of ringgit in hidden taxes as what is happening now,\\u201d he said. Rafizi previously alleged that Putrajaya made RM633 million in one month from the difference between world oil prices and the prices Malaysians pay for petrol and diesel. He said if the federal government refused to revise the system, it meant it wanted to maintain above-market prices to collect taxes from the commodity. \\u2014 The Malaysian Insider This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on January 9, 2015."}, "638": {"date_posted": "8/1/2015", "title": "Petrol stations will go bust, says PKR", "article": " PETALING JAYA: Petrol station operators are at risk of closing down under the automatic price mechanism Putrajaya uses to fix the retail price of petrol and diesel, PKR said, noting that at current pump prices, retailers would have racked up losses of up to RM15,000.

The Pandan MP said that petrol station operators are exposed to losses when oil prices go down because they buy their stocks of petrol and diesel at a higher price. \\u201cOil companies like Petronas, Shell, Petron and BHP have set that every petrol station buys stock that is at least three days\\u2019 worth of their sale at any time,\\u201d he said at a press conference at the party headquarters in Petaling Jaya. \\u201cThey would have to pay for the stock at market price minus the commission, which is 12 sen for petrol and 7 sen for diesel set by the government.\\u201d He said about 70% of some 5,000 petrol stations throughout Malaysia were small- or medium-sized, and sell an average of 500,000 litres of fuel every month. This would generate RM40,000 to RM50,000 in revenue based on the petrol and diesel commissions set by the government. \\u201cAnd from that amount, dealers would have to pay utility bills, rental to oil companies, salaries of workers and other charges. \\u201cWith these costs factored in, petrol station operators gain a net profit of RM5,000 to RM10,000 every month,\\u201d Rafizi said. The PKR vice-president also noted that these operators would also have to keep a huge amount of reserve money to buy the three-day stock. \\u201cSo when the petrol price came down on Jan 1, they automatically lost between RM10,000 and RM15,000 because their stock, which was bought at a higher price, could now be sold at only RM1.91. \\u201cTaking into account their net profit, which is RM5,000 to RM10,000, and the losses incurred in just one day (RM10,000 to RM15,000), [it] means that they will be making losses that month. \\u201cIf this continues, many petrol station operators are facing the risk of closure.\\u201d Rafizi said the government had made a \\u201crash decision\\u201d to cut fuel subsidies without studying the effect on the people and other stakeholders. \\u201cWithout subsidies as the balancing figure, the prices of petrol will keep going down or up, and the changes in prices represent financial risks to the operators.

On the same day, former prime minister Tun Mahathir Mohamad wrote on his blog that \\u201cwe should think very carefully before we comment on the oil price\\u201d. To quote him: \\u201cIs it true that [the fall in oil prices from US$110 to US$70] will have no effect on us (Malaysia) or that it will be good for us?\\u201d Mahathir\\u2019s question is one playing in the minds of many, especially with Malaysia being singled out as Asia\\u2019s only casualty of lower oil pri-ces. While the country is reducing its dependence on oil-related revenue, easily a quarter of its income is tied to the natural resource and it is investments by Petronas and other oil majors that have spurred growth in\\u00a0 oil and gas-related stocks that, in turn, has helped power significant gains on the local stock exchange in recent years. His question on whether growth is indeed unaffected by lower oil prices rings even louder now that oil prices have tumbled 45% from their respective highs in late-June, with Brent crude ending at US$63.33 last Friday and Western Texas Intermediate (WTI) at US$59.39 per barrel. Similarly, the Bloomberg Asia Pacific Tapis crude has fallen 45% over the same six month period to close at US$65.55 last Friday \\u2014 20.1% below Petronas\\u2019 official selling price of US$82.09 a barrel just a fortnight ago on Nov 30 and 37.6% below the US$105 that Malaysia is believed to have based its Budget2015 projections on. The ringgit, which closely tracks the decline in oil prices, skidded 1.04% in one day to a new 51/2-year low of RM3.5073 versus the US dollar around midday last Monday before closing at RM3.4955 on Dec 8 \\u2014 sparking speculation of intervention by Bank Negara, traders say. The ringgit ended at the same level versus the greenback last Friday, 4.4% weaker in just a fortnight. Yields on 10-year Malaysian Government Securities (MGS) maturing July 2024 added 34 basis points to 4.19% last Friday from 3.85% on Nov 28 before the landmark decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) to maintain output, data on Bank Negara\\u2019s website showed. Ten-year Islamic sovereign Malaysian Government Investment Issue (GII) maturing May 2024, meanwhile, climbed to 4.38% last Friday, up 27 basis points from 4.11% on Nov 28 \\u2014 their highest in about 10 months. \\u201cConcerns are mounting whether tremors so far from plunging oil prices will turn into a quake and evolve into something more systemic,\\u201d says Chua Hak Bin, head of emerging Asia economics Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BaML). \\u201cJudging from the official comments so far, the government hasn\\u2019t fully woken up to the economic and financial impact of the collapsing oil prices,\\u201d he tells The Edge. \\u201cPetronas\\u2019 warnings were sounded when oil was at US$75. Oil is now below US$65,\\u201d he says, referring to a recent warning of a 15% to 20% cut in capital expenditure next year that could significantly impact GDP. The prevailing view now is that crude oil prices will stay at between US$60 and US$70 per barrel, possibly for a considerable period, as technological advancements makes it even cheaper to feasibly develop shale oil and gas fields, from North America to the UK as well as China. Nomura International\\u2019s senior political analyst Alastair Newton, for one, recently told clients there\\u2019s something of a fatigue on geopolitical shocks to oil supply that is now being outweighed by over-supply fears. Oil bears are predicting US$40-levels, a level prices saw in 2008 in the wake of the global financial crisis. At the time of writing, Bloomberg data showed 71% or 17 of the 24 research houses predicting Malaysia\\u2019s 2015 GDP will come in below 5.5% \\u2014 the mid-point of the government\\u2019s official forecast of 5% to 6% growth next year. It is worth noting that even the most bullish of predictors \\u2014 Citigroup and Deutsche Bank \\u2014 are only expecting 5.6% GDP growth for 2015. The mid-point was 5.2% with five forecasters saying Malaysia will grow slower than its official forecast at 4.2% to 4.9%\\u00a0(see table). BaML\\u2019s Chua is forecasting 5% GDP growth for 2015, but says \\u201cthe risk is clearly tilted toward the downside\\u201d. \\u201cWe are looking at a small miss on the 3% fiscal deficit target currently (at 3.8% of GDP), but it is not inconceivable that the fiscal deficit should blow up to 5% of GDP or more if Petronas\\u2019 profits and government-related revenue plunges by more than half,\\u201d he says, pointing out that bank loan exposure to oil and gas investments, on the back of the boom in the last few years \\u201ccould be material\\u201d. \\u201cMany oil and gas share prices have plunged by more than 50%. I would be surprised if non-performing loans to the sector does not pick up,\\u201d he says, adding that the tough market conditions will make it difficult for companies looking to tap the equity markets for funds next year. Even without higher cost of debt, corporate debt levels have risen from 80% in early 2008 to over 90% of GDP currently. Similarly, the era of cheap and abundant easy credit caused household debt to mountain to RM854.3 billion or 86.8% of GDP in 2013 from RM243.2 billion or 67.2% of GDP in 2002. Malaysia\\u2019s public debt servicing costs now run at about RM2 billion a month, a result of expansionary measures taken, especially since 2008, to grow Malaysia\\u2019s economy. 2Q2014 GDP hit as high as 6.4% before slowing to 5.6% in 3Q2014. Thanks to the strong growth in the first nine months, Malaysia\\u2019s GDP will only need to grow between 3.8% and 5.8% in 4Q2014 for the country to meet its growth forecast of 5.5% to 6% growth for this year. Still, in the past seven years alone, government debt has climbed from 40% of GDP to just a shade below its self-imposed 55% ceiling. It is projected to reach RM569 billion or 53.8% of GDP in 2014 but the level is nearer to 70% of GDP if contingent liabilities were to be included, experts say. Apart from complicating the decision for Bank Negara to raise interest rates, Malaysia\\u2019s high leverage on all fronts \\u2014 household, corporate and government \\u2014 also likely limits the ability of private consumption (C), domestic investments (I) including that from corporations as well as government spending (G) to power economic growth. These are two out of four key components of GDP growth by expenditure [C+I+G+(X-M)], with the remaining component being net exports (X-M) or the excess of demand for the goods and services produced by a country. While a cheaper ringgit might help spur exports growth, chances are that the impact of lower absolute selling prices for oil as well as other soft commodities like crude palm oil (CPO) would hit first. And given that real estate was the largest contributor to the strength in the \\u201cI\\u201d component\\u2019s contribution to GDP since 2008, the projected headwinds seen in the local real estate sector \\u2014 from an oversupply situation and falling prices to tighter bank mortgage terms \\u2014 would also reduce the component\\u2019s strength as an engine of growth going forward. Malaysia\\u2019s 3% fiscal deficit target for 2015 also puts a cap on government spending, more so given the chances of lower revenue from lower oil prices. While Malaysia\\u2019s Inland Revenue Board (IRB) is reportedly targeting to collect RM142 billion in taxes next year \\u2014 up from RM129 billion in 2013 and its target of RM140 billion this year \\u2014 collection may fall short if salaries and profits of businesses decline, observers say. Another dampener on the \\u201cC\\u201d or consumption component is the impact of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on consumer sentiment and spending from April next year. Malaysia\\u2019s budget deficit could be 4.4% of GDP should oil prices average US$60 to US$69 a barrel, all else being equal, says Maybank Investment Bank\\u2019s chief economist Suhaimi Ilias in a recent note. BaML\\u2019s Chua, for one, reckons that when \\u201cthe \\u2018new reality\\u2019 of indefinitely lower oil prices\\u201d sinks in, Malaysia would find its currently self-imposed \\u201csoft\\u201d budget constraints \\u201cbeing hardened\\u201d: \\u201cLower oil will likely usher in a new age of fiscal austerity and, hopefully, discipline,\\u201d he says. \\u201cThe recent sharp deterioration in the trade balance is also compounding the risks. If November\\u2019s trade surplus does not improve, fears of a current account deficit \\u2014 the first for a long while \\u2014 will re-surface\\u2026 If WTI stays below US$60 and Brent below US$65 for the next 12 months, Malaysia will likely see a \\u2018double miss\\u2019 \\u2014 neither the 3% fiscal nor GDP growth targets will be met in 2015,\\u201d Chua adds. Already, renewed fears of foreigners unwinding their high positions in MGS on the possibility of a sovereign rating cut should Malaysia fall into the so-called twin deficit situation \\u2014 current account deficit as well as fiscal deficit \\u2014 next year have sent the FBM KLCI 4.8% lower the past fortnight to close at 1,732.99 points last Friday. In short, the fear of Malaysia not meeting its fiscal targets is compounded by fears of falling oil prices dragging CPO and liquefied natural gas prices lower, which combined could cause exports to fall sharply and push the current account and balance of payments into a deficit next year. Widespread fears of a sovereign rating downgrade on a \\u201ctwin deficit\\u201d situation happening will cause foreigners to trim holdings in financial assets more aggressively, resulting in sharper-than-expected depreciation of the ringgit, observers say. Foreigners have between July and October this year withdrawn about RM7.3 billion or more than US$2.2 billion worth of investments in Malaysia\\u2019s sovereign debt, as seen by the fall in foreign holdings of MGS to 45.91% in October from 48.35% in July. Foreign holdings of MGS still stood at RM147 billion in October, Bank Negara data show. This is just over one-third of Bank Negara\\u2019s reserves of RM411.7 billion as at end-November, already down by RM8 billion (US$2.4 billion) over one month from RM419.7 billion as at end-October. Foreign selling of ringgit-denominated bonds and subsequent conversion into US dollars would put further pressure on the ringgit, which is already deemed as a casualty of lower oil prices. \\u201cDeclines in ringgit vs USD and crude oil prices so far suggests that every US$10 drop in crude oil price can result in a 6 sen depreciation in ringgit vs USD \\u2026 This is based on the simple observation that as Brent crude tumbled US$47 from this year\\u2019s high back in June 19, the ringgit lost 29 sen against the greenback,\\u201d Maybank\\u2019s Suhaimi wrote in a Dec 9 note. Maybank\\u2019s forex research team forecasts the ringgit to continue on a \\u201cweak bias\\u201d against the USD at 3.50 in 1Q2015, 3.53 in 2Q2015 and 3.55 in 3Q2015 before stabilising to 3.45 in 4Q2015. Just how much further the central bank has had to smoothen the impact of the selling will be revealed when Bank Negara releases its accounts as at\\u00a0Dec 15 this Monday\\u00a0(Dec 22). Whatever the case, Maybank\\u2019s Suhaimi reckons that the tougher conditions from lower oil prices means Malaysia needs to reprioritise its development spending allocation as well as review and optimise its operating expenses to meet its targets. In short, Malaysia needs to \\u201cexercise zero tolerance on avoidable overspending\\u201d that has been repeatedly highlighted in the Auditor General\\u2019s report. If the tough conditions forces out wastages, Malaysia could emerge stronger ahead. Lim Chee Sing, RHB Research Institute\\u2019s executive chairman and chief economist, for one, prefers to see falling oil prices as \\u201ca double-edged sword\\u201d. \\u201cIt acts like an indirect tax cut for people in the large oil importing countries and may just provide a boost that is very much needed for a stalled-speed recovery in the major world economies. For portfolio investors, adversity breeds opportunity, provided you take an investment view and are able to identify and pick quality stocks,\\u201d says Lim, who reckons oil prices will likely stay low \\u201cfor at least another one or two quarters, if not longer\\u201d. With change being the only constant in a dynamic world, Malaysia needs to ensure it makes the best out of the current situation. Admitting that lower oil prices would pose a challenge for Malaysia is the first step in the right direction.

There is growing belief that crude oil prices are in a new trading era of US$70 to U$80 per barrel. This is in stark contrast to the past two years, when O&G was the economy\\u2019s star sector. On the flipside, there are bargain O&G stocks to be picked up on Bursa Malaysia. Valuations may be even more attractive should there be a few more rounds of selling before the dust settles. Last Monday alone, Bursa saw at least RM16.52 billion of market capitalisation in O&G stocks evaporate after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) decided not to cut production. Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) president and CEO Tan Sri Shamsul Azhar Abbas\\u2019 remark about cutting the national oil firm\\u2019s capex for next year added weight to the plunge. The sharp fall in O&G stocks caused the FBMKLCI to tumble 2.34% to 1,778.27 points, its worst drop since Jan 18, 2013. All 37 companies with core businesses related to the O&G industry fell, some by double-digit percentages. Offshore drilling service providers saw the heaviest fall last Monday. UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd lost 17.67% of its value to end at RM2.33, while Perisai Petroleum Teknologi Bhd shed 19.26% to 54.5 sen. An analyst says Petronas\\u2019 capex cut could negatively impact exploration and drilling players. Since October this year, SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd has lost RM9.71 billion of market cap; Bumi Armada Bhd, RM4.87 billion; Dialog Group Bhd, RM1.77 billion; Petronas Dagangan Bhd RM3.06 billion; and UMW Oil & Gas Bhd, RM2.94 billion. As the O&G operating environment becomes tougher, companies with strong balance sheets and clear earnings visibility over the next three years will tend to stand out. In fact, there is still activity in the sector. Last Friday, SapuraKencana announced it had obtained eight contracts and contract renewals worth RM1.58 billion from various clients. The recent selldown has pushed O&G counters to a level of price-earnings multiples not seen since the global financial crisis in 2009. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not in another financial crisis, for sure. Now, the depressed prices are due to oversupply, and they\\u2019re much higher than during the last crisis. Looking at the historical valuations, O&G stocks were traded at eight to nine times their price-earnings ratio,\\u201d says an insurance fund manager. After the onset of the global credit crunch in September 2008, crude oil prices plunged from a peak of US$146.08 to US$40. By comparison, Brent was traded at US$69.15 per barrel, and WTI, at US$66.30 per barrel, at the time of writing last Friday. AllianceDBS Research analyst Arhnue Tan tells\\u00a0The Edge\\u00a0that she is now valuing big-cap O&G stocks\\u2019 target prices at forward price-earnings ratios in the mid-teens, while mid-caps are ascribed price-earnings multiples in the low-teens. These valuations are at least 40% lower than the forward 20 times price-earnings ratios (or more) that O&G stocks used to command. However, AllianceDBS\\u2019s current band of earnings multiples is still higher than the range seen during the global financial crisis. Analysts and fund managers also say that downstream players could be less affected by depressed oil prices. One name in the subsector that comes to mind is Dialog. \\u201cThere might be higher volumes of oil stored at Dialog\\u2019s Pengerang independent deepwater petroleum terminal when prices are lower,\\u201d says a fund manager. However, an analyst says that it might be premature to say so, as it all hinges on demand for oil. Bloomberg data, however, shows that analysts still favour Dialog, with nine of 17 recommending a \\u201cbuy\\u201d at an average target price of RM1.71. The counter closed at RM1.35 last Friday. While fund managers and analysts think there could be buying opportunities in some of the battered blue chips, they say it might take at least six months for investors\\u2019 sentiment on the O&G industry to recover, so long as oil prices have stabilised. \\u201cIt is still unclear what contract flows will be like next year. The upstream players that rely mostly on Petronas projects could be badly hurt. Once oil prices recover to US$70 or above (Petronas\\u2019 production cost is estimated at US$65 a barrel), investors might warm up again to O&G stocks. Right now, it\\u2019s just too unpredictable to look into a lot of the mid-caps,\\u201d a fund manager says. RHB Research Institute projects that Brent crude could fall to as low as US$60 in the next six months. However, it estimates that the price could recover to between US$90 and US$100 per barrel in 12 to 24 months. Big-cap SapuraKencana is the top recommendation of O&G analysts given its depressed valuations. After losing more than 20.06% in market value in just four weeks, SapuraKencana was traded at a forward price-earnings multiple of 10.64 times, according to Blommberg. SapuraKencana has an order book value of RM26.8 billion, equivalent to 3.2 times its FY2014 revenue. SapuraKencana vice-chairman Tan Sri Mokhzani Mahathir bought three million shares last week in a move seen by O&G bulls as a sign of confidence in the group. The same could be said for Bumi Armada, which fell to an all-time low of 98 sen last Monday. Although Hassan Basma, who stepped down as CEO last Friday, had been trimming his stake in the fifth-largest floating production and storage offloading (FPSO) provider in the world, former deputy chairman Datuk Ahmad Fuad Md Ali and Datuk Abdul Farish Abd Rashid bought more Bumi Armada shares after the O&G rout last Monday. Bumi Armada has declined by 57.5% to date this year. In a note, MIDF Research says that Bumi Armada\\u2019s order book stood at RM21.8 billion, with extension options amounting to RM11.8 billion. \\u201cWe believe Bumi Armada will be able to weather the storm as the large portion of its order book consists of fixed long-term FPSO contracts with extension options and only 9% consists of OSV contracts,\\u201d the research house said. In the first nine months of its financial year ending Dec 31, 2014, Bumi Armada\\u2019s net profit of RM271.25 million was 20.89% lower year-on-year. In an earlier interview with\\u00a0The Edge, Hassan explained that the drop was due to a change in the accounting treatment of the company\\u2019s assets, from operating lease to finance lease, since the beginning of this year. The change means earnings from its FPSO business are recognised progressively. In a note last Thursday, AllianceDBS\\u2019s Tan said Dayang Enterprise\\u2019s sole focus on the offshore brownfield segment shields the company from volatility in crude oil prices. \\u201cDayang Enterprise\\u2019s earnings will remain resilient even during periods of weak crude oil prices.\\u00a0This is because brownfield activities would be ongoing to sustain offshore production. To recap, the group\\u2019s earnings were also resilient during the 2008/09 financial crisis.\\u201d This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on December 8 - 14, 2014."}, "643": {"date_posted": "2/1/2015", "title": "JF Apex Research lowers end-2015 KLCI target to 1,720 points", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 2): JF Apex Securities Research has revised downwards its end-2015 target for the FBM KLCI to 1,720 points from 1,930 previously, saying the local stock market will continue to exhibit choppy trade as long as crude oil price stays sluggish and the ringgit continues to weaken against the US dollar. In a strategy note Jan 2, the research house said foreign selling would re-emerge whenever there was a concern on the slump in oil price which could trigger the country\\u2019s fiscal budget and current account deficits. \\u201cAs oil price might need 3-6 months to stabilise and find its equilibrium,as shale oil prelude the \\u2018new chapter\\u2019 of oil supply, we expect the local bourse to stay volatile with a downward bias in 1H15,\\u201d it said.\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0 JF Apex said that following the recent major correction to 1670-1690 points, the FBM KLCI is now trading at 15.9x 2014 PE and 14.6x 2015 PE as compared to 16.6x 2014 PE and 15.2x 2015 PE on July 14. \\u201cWe deem current valuation reasonable but is yet to be attractive as the FBM KLCI is now trading at +0.5 standard deviation above its historical mean of 15x for current PE and \\u20130.25 standard deviation below its mean for forward PE,\\u201d it said. The research house foresees the domestic economic outlook for 2015 to remain challenging as tumbling oil prices could derail the government\\u2019s budget deficit target of 3% of GDP for 2015 (based on oil price of US$100/barrel under government projection). This is because reduction in government coffers may outweigh the savings on subsidies, since oil revenue make up 30% of national income and the soon-to-be-implemented GST is yet to contribute significantly to total revenue in 2015, it said. \\u201cFurthermore, the shrinking current account surplus would continue and possibly turn into deficit in the coming months, no thanks to the slump in commodities' prices. \\u201cHence, our concern on downgrade of sovereign credit rating will expedite the outflow of foreign funds from our bond and equity markets,\\u201d it said. JF Apex also foresees a slew of downside risks which could derail its \"still positive\" view on the equity market or even trigger a \"bear market\", in light of the following developments: a) spillover effect of Russia\\u2019s crisis and geopolitical tensions re-emerging in Ukraine b) exodus of foreign funds from emerging markets due to depreciation of Asian currencies c) sharper-than-expected fall in China's economic growth d) doubtful economic recovery of Japan and EU which relate to the effectiveness of Abenomics and ECB\\u2019s monetary stimulus e) significant slowdown in domestic GDP growth as a result of decline in export and local consumption coupled with possible downgrade of sovereign rating pursuant to a \"twin deficit.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0 JF Apex said investors should adopt a combination of defensive and active investment strategy by investing in undervalued stocks, either small cap or mid and large cap stocks, with positive newsflow and brighter earnings prospects, in addition to the high yield stocks with resilient business models which are unfazed by the downturn in economic growth. It is recommending this instead of a passive investment strategy as it believes the key component index-linked counters such as banking, telco, plantation, oil and gas (O&G) currently lacked positive leads to drive the index higher.\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u201cOverweight on construction. We continue to see a flux of contract awards as highlighted under Budget 2015 and upcoming announcement of 11th Malaysia Plan in May/June to excite the construction sector. \\u201cDowngrade oil & gas to 'marketweight' but \\u2018still\\u2019 positive on selected stocks. For O&G sector, despite recent slump in share prices and Petronas\\u2019 capex reduction by 15%-20%, we deem the current valuations attractive as earnings are still backed by healthy orderbook in relation to earlier bagged contracts,\\u201d it said. However, JF Apex said it was selective on stock picks with preference for mid and large cap stocks which could withstand weakening oil price, development in brownfield and full-fledged players with business exposures ranging from upstream, midstream to downstream. Elswhere, JF Apex said it was \\u201cneutral\\u201d with positive bias on rubber glove and telco sectors, and \\u201cneutral\\u201d with negative bias on automotive, consumer, plantation and property sectors. The research house said its top picks were IJM Corporation Bhd (TP: RM7.66), Gadang Holdings Bhd (TP: RM2.57), SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd (TP: RM4.19), Pantech Holdings Bhd (TP:RM1.14), Top Glove Corporation Bhd (TP; RM5.35), Genting Plantations Bhd (TP: RM11.40), LBS Bina Group Bhd (TP: RM2.03) and QL Resources Bhd (TP; RM3.90)."}, "644": {"date_posted": "1/1/2015", "title": "Cover Story: Malaysia adjusting to the \\u2018new normal\\u2019", "article": " SINGLED OUT as Asia\\u2019s only net casualty of lower oil prices, it is easy to forget Malaysia was the world\\u2019s envied hotbed for billion-dollar home-grown IPOs just two years back. That is just one example of how quickly fortunes can turn in the current post-global financial crisis and post-US Federal Reserve quantitative easing (QE) era \\u2014 so much so that experts deem volatility as a constant feature in the new normal. Back home in Malaysia, the higher priced RON97 petrol that was eschewed at the pumps not too long ago is now reportedly facing a supply shortage as its price differential with the regular RON95 dwindled to a mere 20 sen a litre effective Dec 1, with prices fixed at RM2.46 and RM2.26, respectively. There is no early Christmas cheer, though. Consumers are already paying new prices for goods that have been priced upwards in anticipation of higher costs next year as the Goods and Services Tax (GST) kicks in from April. Year-end holidays abroad will also likely be dearer with the ringgit skidding 2.73% in five days to 3.4757 against the greenback midday last Friday \\u2014 a level last seen over five years ago in September 2009. The loss is 10.5% if measured from its recent high of 3.1463 on\\u00a0Aug 27. Currency experts are keeping close watch on movements as economists still see reason for concern. The ringgit\\u2019s slide happened as oil prices tumbled to hover at their lowest in five years after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) resolved to maintain output at its late-November meeting, a move that experts say both defends its market share and forces US shale gas producers to cut supply. At the time of writing, Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) were hovering at US$69.15 and US$66.20 per barrel \\u2014 down close to 40% from their year-high of US$115.06 and US$107.26 since late-June. The premium Bloomberg Asia-Pacific Tapis crude price stood at US$72.58 last Friday \\u2014 31% below the US$100 to US$105 that economists calculate Malaysia had based its revenue projection and planned its Budget 2015 on. Petronas\\u2019 official selling price for Tapis was US$82.09 in November, down from US$90.55 in October and US$117.17 in November 2013, Bloomberg data showed. Chua Hak Bin, head of Emerging Asia Economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told clients Malaysia\\u2019s fiscal deficit could widen to 3.8% of GDP next year from 3.5% this year \\u2014 missing the country\\u2019s 3% target for 2015, despite scrapping fuel subsidies. This was after Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) president Tan Sri Shamsul Azhar Abbas reportedly said the national oil company\\u2019s payments to the government could be 37% lower at RM43 billion next year (2.3% of GDP) if oil prices continue to hover around US$75 a barrel. Assuming a worst-case scenario of a sustained drop in Brent to US$60 in 2015, the ringgit will see persistent weakness and Malaysia\\u2019s GDP could only grow 3% to 4% next year \\u2014 sharply below the official projection of between 5% and 6% \\u2014 AllianceDBS Research\\u2019s economist Manokaran Mottain wrote in a Dec 3 note. \\u201cRisk of a trade deficit scenario is highly likely in the first half of 2015,\\u201d he said, adding that a small current account deficit situation could happen as early as 1Q2015, should exports remain weak. Renewed fears of foreigners unwinding their high positions in Malaysian Government Securities (MGS) on the possibility of a sovereign rating cut should Malaysia fall into the so-called twin deficit situation \\u2014 current account deficit as well as fiscal deficit \\u2014 next year also sent the local benchmark FBM KLCI 4.1% lower in just four days to 1,745.69 points last Thursday before recovering to end the week at 1,749.37 points. This is still the lowest since September 2013 when there was similar fear of Malaysia\\u2019s current account balance falling into a deficit from weak exports. In short, the fear of Malaysia not meeting its fiscal targets is compounded by fears of falling oil prices dragging CPO prices lower, which combined could cause exports to fall sharply and push the current account and balance of payments into a deficit next year. If this materialises, Malaysia could see a sovereign rating downgrade. Widespread fears of that happening will cause foreigners to trim holdings in financial assets more aggressively, resulting in sharper-than-expected depreciation of the ringgit, observers say. A more bearish market outlook will also hamper fundraising exercises, and curb any second round \\u201cwealth effect\\u201d from stock market gains, they add. Between July and October this year, foreigners had already withdrawn about RM7.3 billion or more than US$2.2 billion worth of investments in Malaysia\\u2019s sovereign debt, as seen by the fall in foreign holdings of MGS to 45.91% in October from 48.35% in July. Foreign holdings of MGS stood at RM147 billion in October, Bank Negara Malaysia data show. This is just over one-third of Bank Negara\\u2019s reserves of RM411.7 billion (US$125.7 billion) as at end-November 2014, which was enough to fund 8.4 months of retained imports and 1.1 times short-term external debt. In just one month, Bank Negara\\u2019s reserves had fallen by US$2.4 billion from RM419.7 billion as at end-October. Yet, Minister in the Prime Minister\\u2019s Department Datuk Seri Abdul Wahid Omar, the former group CEO of Malayan Banking Bhd whom Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak tapped to head the country\\u2019s Economic Planning Unit, insists Malaysia is still a beneficiary of lower oil prices and can meet its 3% fiscal deficit target for 2015 if oil prices stay at the current US$70 levels. \\u201cI think it is very important to note the fact that in Malaysia, we always work on medium-term planning and we\\u2019re mindful that in the global markets, be it equities, oil prices or currencies, these are all subjected to market fluctuations. It is our belief that if we focus on fundamentals, then, in the medium term, things will be ok,\\u201d Abdul Wahid tells\\u00a0The Edge. Pointing out that Malaysia has over the years reduced its dependency on resource-based exports and now has the services and manufacturing sectors making up over 80% of the country\\u2019s economy, he insists the country has strong enough fundamentals to withstand any near-term shocks. Malaysia is also not in danger of falling into a twin-deficit situation should oil prices remain above US$70 per barrel, Abdul Wahid says, pointing out that the situation continues to be carefully managed. Already, fiscal savings from the scrapping of fuel subsidies\\u00a0 are RM11 billion to RM13 billion of the total RM37.7 billion budgeted for subsidies in 2015, he adds. He declines, however, to say at what level of oil price Malaysia would no longer see net benefits. RHB Research Institute executive chairman and chief economist Lim Chee Sing also reckons investors have over-reacted to the plunge in crude oil prices. He reckons that a RM3 billion to RM5 billion revenue gap resulting from lower oil prices \\u201cis still manageable and can be bridged\\u201d by a combination of measures, such as having Petronas maintain a high level of dividend to the government as well as the government cutting its planned RM6 billion increase in development spending budgeted for 2015 and utilising the RM2 billion contingency expenditure. \\u201c[A combination of these measures] would mean the government could still achieve its fiscal deficit target of 3% of GDP next year if measures are taken to cut expenditure and/or raise revenue,\\u201d Lim says. But what if oil falls below US$65? Should Brent crude fall another US$10 to average US$65 per barrel, however,\\u00a0 Lim calculates that Malaysia\\u2019s fiscal deficit could widen by another one percentage GDP point and potentially derail the government\\u2019s momentum. \\u201cI would say it would be difficult for the government to achieve its fiscal deficit target if Brent crude were to fall below US$70 on a sustained basis unless GST revenue turns up to be much stronger than anticipated,\\u201d he says, adding that oil prices could temporarily slip below US$60 a barrel, given the current oversupply situation is estimated at 1.8 million barrels a day more than the estimated demand of about 92.4 million barrels a day. \\u201cWhen most news on oil and gas is negative, markets tend to over-react by suppressing oil prices. I do expect oil prices to find a bottom somewhere in 1Q2015 and start to rebound from there, but I\\u2019m no expert in oil prices,\\u201d Lim says, adding that he is \\u201cslightly more optimistic\\u201d than the Petronas president\\u2019s forecast of US$70 to US$75 per barrel. Nonetheless, Lim concurs that concerns over the prices for another two sizeable Malaysian exports \\u2014 liquefied natural gas (LNG) and crude palm oil \\u2014 falling in tandem with oil prices are not unfounded. For one, the plunge in crude oil prices has wiped out biodiesel margins, reducing the likelihood of any increase in demand from non-mandatory usage of biodiesel. While Malaysia is now a small net oil importer, the inclusion of LNG makes it a net exporter of oil and gas \\u2014 RM60.7 billion or 6.1% of GDP last year and RM42.6 billion or 5.4% of GDP in the first nine months of this year. According to Lim, the potential net impact on CPO exports is relatively smaller given that CPO accounts for about 6% of total exports versus 8% for LNG. Pointing out that LNG prices fell about 23% in 2009 when crude oil prices fell an average 37%, he reckons that a 20% fall in LNG prices could translate into an RM11 billion decline in export value or about 1% of GDP. That\\u2019s just a very rough estimate, however, as \\u201cthere are no global benchmarks on LNG because each LNG exporter has a different cost structure due to differences such as transport costs\\u201d. Moreover, Malaysia\\u2019s LNG exports are based on long-term contracts, which means that \\u201csliding prices will probably take a longer time to show\\u201d, BaML\\u2019s Chua says. \\u201cCeteris paribus (all else being equal), a rough calculation would suggest that it would take LNG prices to fall more than 40% and CPO prices more than 20% before the current account would risk falling into a deficit,\\u201d Lim says. As at end-September, Malaysia\\u2019s current account surplus stood at RM43.4 billion or 5.5% of GDP, that\\u2019s better than a surplus of RM37.3 billion or 3.8% of GDP last year. Still, latest export numbers could spark more jitters. That Malaysia\\u2019s exports plunged 3.1% year on year in October and saw its trade surplus narrow to just RM1.19 billion from RM9.3 billion in September as the value of imports rose flags \\u201cwarning signs for the fourth quarter current account balance\\u201d, Chua writes in a Dec 5 report. With soft commodity prices, weaker oil, and patchy global economic growth, Malaysia\\u2019s export performance will likely remain lacklustre in the months ahead, Chua says, pointing out that Malaysia\\u2019s current account surplus had already narrowed to RM7.6 billion or 2.8% of GDP in 3Q, from RM16 billion or 6.1% in 2Q. \\u201cThere is a risk that the current account could slip into a small deficit in 4Q, especially if imports stay strong. Malaysia last registered a current account deficit during the 1997 Asian financial crisis,\\u201d Chua adds. Whether or not a weaker ringgit will help shore up exports in the months ahead, Chua would not be surprised Malaysia continues to tap Petronas to cover its cash needs. \\u201cPetronas has been Malaysia\\u2019s cash cow and sovereign oil fund. Some might even regard Petronas as the government\\u2019s banker of last resort, providing ready funds in the event of a crisis,\\u201d Chua says, pointing out that Petronas \\u201chas probably paid out more than RM500 billion to the government over the past decade. If not for these funds, the fiscal deficit would have been twice as wide\\u201d. \\u201cAnd that\\u2019s exactly the point, Malaysia is too reliant on Petronas and vulnerable to Petronas\\u2019 fortunes\\u2026 If we accept lower oil prices as \\u2018the new normal\\u2019 Petronas\\u2019 profits and cash flow could easily fall by more than half in the coming years.\\u201d Petronas is already warning of lower capex due to lower oil prices, something Chua reckons will come home to roost. \\u201cOil and gas investments and projects was a centrepiece of the whole Economic Transformation Programme. With oil and gas investments likely to subside, weaker investments will slow GDP growth next year. There is no other clear substitute which can replace Petronas\\u2019 leadership,\\u201d Chua says. For those looking for a silver lining from the oil price slide, economists like Chua reckon that the recent weakness \\u201chas increased the likelihood of Bank Negara staying on hold and accommodative in 2015\\u201d at least for the first half of 2015. RHB\\u2019s Lim shares this view, given that the downside risks to economic growth are far greater than the concern of a spike in inflation upon the implementation of GST. \\u201cThe best course of action [for Bank Negara] would probably be to maintain its overnight policy rate at the current level and continue to intervene, from time to time, in the foreign exchange markets to prevent spikes in the currency that could be damaging to business investment decisions,\\u201d he says. This respite, however, is only temporary. As volatility is seen as a new constant in the new normal, it is likely that every policy decision could have a critical bearing on the sustainability of Malaysia\\u2019s competitiveness.

One of the O&G-related stocks that reflect such value is APB Resources Bhd, an established process equipment fabricator involved mainly in the petrochemical, oleochemical and energy sectors. Unlike the tough outlook for vessel operators in the offshore segment of the O&G industry, APB is said to be well insulated as it produces pressure vessels, heat exchangers and heat recovery steam generators \\u2014 equipment that will be needed in the ongoing refinery and petrochemical integrated development (RAPID) project in Pengerang, Johor. According to analysts, national oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) is unlikely to cut its commitment to RAPID despite the current low oil price environment. APB has fallen 34.62% from its 52-week high of RM1.56 on Aug 5. At its RM1.03 close last Friday, however, the stock was still 13% higher year to date, had a market capitalisation of RM114.2 million and was trading at 9.3 times its historical earnings of RM12.19 million or 11 sen a share in its financial year ended Sept 30, 2014. The stock is also trading well below the sum-of-parts valuation of RM2.07 ascribed by Hong Leong Investment Bank\\u2019s analyst Jason Tan Yat Teng. APB\\u2019s net assets per share stood at RM1.61 in FY2014. Since the company was listed on Bursa Malaysia in May 2004, it has been delivering uninterrupted profits and consistently paying a dividend of 6.5 sen per share, except in FY2011 when it paid three sen per share. In FY2014, APB declared a first interim dividend of 3.5 sen per share in May, followed by a final dividend of three sen per share. Its closing price of RM1.03 last Friday translates into a historical dividend yield of 6.31%, making it one of the few O&G stocks to give a decent dividend return. By comparison, the dividend yield of its peers CB Industrial Product Holding Bhd and Boilermech Holdings Bhd, among others, stood at 2.26% and 0.91% respectively. Note that the valuation ascribed by Tan of Hong Leong Investment Bank was published on July 31, when Brent crude oil price was still at a high level of US$106.80 per barrel. Since then, Brent has tumbled 33.99% and closed at US$70.50 per barrel last Friday. Tan tells The Edge that the downstream segment of the O&G industry is not expected to be as badly affected by low crude oil prices as the upstream segment. \\u201cAPB\\u2019s fortunes depend on whether it will get contracts from Petronas for the RAPID project. While the group is not directly bidding for any part of the project, it could benefit from subcontracts, especially on the process equipment side.\\u201d He notes in a Dec 1 report that while Petronas CEO Tan Sri Shamsul Azhar Abbas has declared that the national oil company may cut capital expenditure by 15% to 20% next year amid low oil prices, the US$27 billion RAPID project, which has received final investment decision, is unlikely to be affected by the spending cut. \\u00a0 The view that the downstream segment of the O&G industry might be insulated from the bearish crude oil prices is shared by other local analysts, many of whom have upgraded their recommendations on the relevant players. Mohshin Aziz, an O&G analyst with Maybank Investment Bank, was among the first to upgrade Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd, the bellwether of Malaysia\\u2019s petrochemical industry, to a \\u201cbuy\\u201d from a \\u201chold\\u201d last Thursday. \\u201cThe petrochemical market is in a balanced state and everyone is behaving rationally. Despite what is happening to crude oil prices, this industry is not in a state of panic or crisis,\\u201d he says in a Dec 4 report. Industry observers say the stable outlook for the downstream segment, especially in the petrochemical industry, will prop up process equipment manufacturers, including APB. Demand for process equipment is going to be stable next year, says Tan. Besides supplying process equipment to the petrochemical industry, APB also operates in the oleochemical industry, which, according to APB chairman, managing director and largest shareholder Yap Kow @ Yap Kim Fah, has greatly helped the group ride out the downturn in fabrication demand in the past few years. \\u201cIn the coming years, the group should benefit from increasing capital expenditure due to rapid expansion of oil palm acreage and demand for oleochemical end-products, particularly in Asia,\\u201d states Yap in the group\\u2019s 2013 annual report. On the operations side, APB\\u2019s order book stood at RM70 million the last time Tan of Hong Leong Investment Bank got in touch with the group in July. This should sustain APB for at least nine months, he states in his report. \\u201cWe understand that the contract duration for process equipment is relatively short \\u2014 from six to nine months. Past track records suggest that order book replenishment rate will offset the contract burn rate and sustain revenue going forward.\\u201d Judging from the group\\u2019s FY2014 results, with net profit up 17.6% to RM12.2 million year on year, APB is doing well operationally. It undertook higher-margin contracts in the final quarter ended Sept 30. As a result, 4QFY2014 revenue declined 19.5% to RM30.2 million y-o-y while gross margin rose to 27.8% from 20.4%. Gross profit also increased from RM7.7 million to RM8.4 million in the quarter. APB has a clean balance sheet with no borrowings. Its cash and cash equivalents stood at about RM40 million as at Sept 30, constituting 35% of its market capitalisation of RM114.2 million last Friday.

As at 10.48am, Lafarge was flat at RM9.91 with 72,800 shares done, in line with the weaker broader market sentiment. The counter had earlier gained 0.8% or 8 sen when the market opened, but then declined to RM9.75 at 9.14am. The cement manufacturer was awarded with a contract for supplying concrete to the Refinery and Petrochemicals Integrated Development (Rapid) project and other Petronas-related projects in Pengerang, Johor worth RM254 million for five years, it told Bursa yesterday. In a separate announcement, Lafarge said it had through its unit Associated Pan Malaysia Cement Sdn Bhd, purchased a cement mill and ancillaries from Lafarge Ciment (Romania) for \\u20ac10.663 million (RM45.95 million). Despite being positive on the two major announcements, Kenanga IB Research said the additional earnings contribution averaging RM50.8 million per year to Lafarge was relatively small as it made up only about 1% of estimated revenue from financial year 2015 (FY15) onwards. \"The mill acquisition from Lafarge Romania is within expectations as we believe this is part of the ongoing mill expansion program at Lafarege Malaysia\\u2019s Kanthan and Rawang cement plant,\" said Kenanga IB Research analyst Voon Yee Ping. Voon said once the acquisition is completed, Lafarge Malaysia should see capacity increased by 1.2 million metric tons (MT) to 14.2 million MT per year by mid-2016. \"The news is positive to Lafarge Malaysia, but we think the impact to share price should be limited due to the relatively small effect on earnings from the RAPID contract, while for the mill acquisition, we believe the earnings growth on the group's expansion has already been priced in,\" Voon added. \"Despite our expectation of robust domestic construction growth, the sector-wide capacity expansion is likely to intensify competition and result in depressed cement prices in the near-term,\" Voon stressed. Kenanga is maintaining Lafarge's core net profit forecast for FY14 and FY15 of RM324 million and RM425 million respectively. The firm is also maintaining \"Market Perform\" rating with unchanged TP of RM10 on Lafarge as any positive from improved market demand may be negated by lower average selling price (ASP) due to increased competition in the domestic cement industry. Meanwhile, Hong Leong Investment Bank Research (HLIB Research) viewed the contract award as positive to Lafarge and in line with its positive outlook on the company. \"We reckon that the above acquisition by Lafarge is beneficial as acquiring a relatively new cement mill and equipment from the related party would generate cost savings compared to buying a new mill by a different party,\" Mohd Fadzrul Mohd Salman, an analyst with HLIB Research said in a note to clients today. He said the acquisition impact on the cash level was minimal as the total consideration only accounted for 10.6% of total net cash of RM434.1 million Lafarge has as at 3QFY14. \"We reiterated our 'Buy' call with unchanged target price of (TP) of RM10.72 based on 22.5 times 2016 earnings per share (EPS) of 47.7 sen. \\u00a0 \\u00a0"}, "648": {"date_posted": "23/12/2014", "title": "Trade Wise: MUI in limelight for asset sale plan, Khoo\\u2019s divorce", "article": " WHILE THE billion-ringgit divorce case of business tycoon Tan Sri Khoo Kay Peng continues to make the headlines in the Malaysian and UK tabloids, investors are fascinated by the news that his asset-rich flagship Malayan United Industries Bhd (MUI) is looking at the disposal of assets to unlock value. Trading in MUI\\u2019s shares was suspended for almost four working days (from Nov 20 to 25) before the group announced to Bursa Malaysia that it is engaged in \\u201cserious discussions\\u201d with a potential party to explore the possibilities of disposing of \\u201ccertain substantial assets\\u201d to realise their value. MUI didn\\u2019t elaborate which assets would be involved or how substantial they would be. However, considering the group\\u2019s usually jittery response to speculation of asset disposal and the almost four-day suspension of its shares, investors see the announcement as significant. MUI was up 17.4% from 23 sen on Nov 23 to 27 sen last Friday, giving the company a market capitalisation of RM747.8 million. \\u00a0 The flagship of Khoo, MUI owns assets with a potential market value that is said to be far greater than its enterprise value (EV) of RM1.34 billion (its market capitalisation plus net borrowings of RM588.3 million as at Sept 30, 2014), according to market observers who follow the stock. Of the assets, the jewel of the crown appears to be Corus Hotel Hyde Park at Lancaster Gate, London, which reportedly could fetch a market value of \\u00a3200 million (RM1.06 billion). The 390-room hotel that MUI had acquired in 2001 sits on 21,635 sq ft of freehold land and is carried at a net book value (NBV) of only RM257.5 million in the company\\u2019s balance sheet. At \\u00a3200 million, Corus Hotel Hyde Park would be valued at \\u00a3513,000 per room. By comparison, the 447-room InterContinental Park Lane, situated on the other side of Hyde Park, was transacted last year at \\u00a3301.5 million or a price per room of about \\u00a3675,000. Back home, MUI owns the refurbished Corus Hotel in Jalan Ampang, Kuala Lumpur, which sits on a 78,458 sq ft plot opposite the Petronas Twin Towers. This property is carried at an NBV of only RM60.5 million or RM771 psf. MUI also has two plots of freehold land (with buildings on them now) in Jalan Ampang. One measures 38,104 sq ft and is carried at RM8.1 million (RM213 psf) while the other is 32,895 sq ft and carried at RM24.6 million or RM750 psf. The first plot was acquired in 1991 and the second in 2007. James Wong, managing director of registered property valuer VPC Alliance (KL) Sdn Bhd, tells The Edge that Corus Hotel Kuala Lumpur can fetch indicative values of RM212 million or RM2,700 psf and the two plots RM1,800 psf each, which translates into a total market value of RM127.8 million. Apart from its notable property assets, MUI owns stakes in two major retailers as well \\u2014 98.22% of local player Metrojaya Bhd and 35.17% of London-listed Laura Ashley Holdings Plc. While it is difficult to ascertain the value of Metrojaya as it is no longer listed, MUI\\u2019s stake in Laura Ashley is worth \\u00a370.84 million (RM375.8 million). MUI also holds equity interest in MUI Properties Bhd (74.32% valued at RM206.5 million), Pan Malaysia Corp Bhd (66.51%, RM108.4 million) and Pan Malaysia Holdings Bhd (69.19%, RM77.1 million). All are listed on Bursa Malaysia. Despite its rich assets, MUI reported a net loss of RM3.08 million or 0.1 sen a share in the nine months ended Sept 30, 2014, on revenue of RM441.19 million. The reasons for the dismal results include its high cost of borrowings (RM36.33 million) and relatively low yields from its core businesses in the hotel and retail industries. According to the company\\u2019s 2013 annual report, Corus Hotel Hyde Park reported a pre-tax profit of \\u00a33.5 million (RM18.54 million) in FY2013 while Corus Hotel Kuala Lumpur delivered RM15 million. Considering what these two assets can fetch on the market through disposal or redevelopment \\u2014 more so in the case of the Jalan Ampang property \\u2014 the returns that MUI has been deriving from them are deemed low. \\u201cLondon property prices have gone up quite a lot. If I could get rid of these assets at a good price, I would \\u2026 As for the retail business, it is still generating stable income and I\\u2019d keep it,\\u201d says a businessman, adding that MUI needs to realise the value of its assets or make them work harder and, at the same time, trim its debt. Indeed, there was news in the UK in July that MUI had appointed a real estate agent to scout around for a buyer for Corus Hotel Hyde Park. However, this was denied by MUI when reported by The Edge Financial Daily on Sept 29, quoting the UK article. Whatever MUI\\u2019s plan may be, its growth potential has attracted savvy investor Datuk Dr Yu Kuan Chon. As per The Edge Financial Daily\\u2019s Sept 29 report, the company\\u2019s 2013 annual report \\u2014 published on June 4, 2014 \\u2014 listed Yu as one of its top 30 shareholders with 44.63 million shares or a 1.53% stake as at April 28, 2014. Yu\\u2019s name did not appear anywhere in MUI\\u2019s 2012 annual report, which means he must have purchased the shares between the second half of 2013 and early this year. The chairman of YNH Property Bhd, Yu is regarded as a shrewd businessman. He managed to block an attempt by tycoon Tan Sri Quek Leng Chan to privatise Hong Leong Capital Bhd (HLCap) last year as he believed the company\\u2019s value was higher than what Quek had offered. Since April, however, it is not known whether Yu has purchased more shares in MUI or sold any. Coming back to MUI\\u2019s announcement to Bursa on Nov 25, the group says it will make a full disclosure of the transaction once discussions are completed and an agreement has been entered into. It, however, has reminded its shareholders that there is no certainty on the outcome of the discussions. \\u201cWhat I suspect is that the buyer and seller (MUI) thought they could come to an agreement last Tuesday. But come Tuesday, they had not come to a conclusion while the stock had to resume trading,\\u201d says an observer. However, if one looks at it positively \\u2014 that MUI is thinking of disposing of its substantial assets to realise their value \\u2014 it puts the group on a path to enhancing shareholder value. Meanwhile, last Friday\\u2019s news that the Kuala Lumpur High Court had ruled that it had the jurisdiction to hear Khoo\\u2019s billion-ringgit divorce dispute against his estranged wife, former beauty queen Pauline Chai, will continue to put the tycoon under the spotlight. Chai has sought for the divorce case to be heard in the UK, where the sums paid out can be extraordinary. According to British media, she is expected to demand half of Khoo\\u2019s estimated RM2.3 billion (\\u00a3440 million) fortune. Considering the amount, it\\u2019s hard not to think that the divorce case will have an indirect impact on MUI, in which Khoo owns 47.67%. According to a report by The Malaysian Insider, Judge Yeoh Wee Siam said Chai\\u2019s domicile was in Malaysia and so the Malaysian court could hear and determine the couple\\u2019s divorce case. \\u201cThe common law principle that the wife\\u2019s domicile is dependent on her husband continues to apply in Malaysia,\\u201d she said in allowing Khoo\\u2019s application.

The oil and gas industry website Upstream reported last Friday that Hyundai Heavy Industries is close to securing a US$1 billion (RM3.49 billion) engineering, procurement and fabrication contract for the central processing platform for the Baram Delta Gas Gathering Project 2 (Bardegg 2) and Baronia enhanced oil recovery project off Malaysia. This contract, if awarded to Hyundai, will mark the South Korean\\u2019s second major Malaysia contract win this year. In June 2014, the group secured a turnkey contract from Hess Corp to build a large central processing platform under the North Malay basin gas and condensate development. SapuraKencana, another major upstream engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC) player, fared reasonably well in the domestic fabrication space this year. In June this year, this group secured US$415 million engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning (EPCIC) contracts for the construction and installation of three remote wellhead platforms for North Malay Basin and four wellhead platforms for JDA Block B-17 and B17-01 field development. In addition, in December 2014 the group secured an RM480 million EPCC contract for the Baronia and Tukau wellhead platforms and RM140 million EPCC contract for the Angsi compression module. Meanwhile, MHB is losing out to its competitors. The group has secured a mere RM323 million worth of contracts year-to-date (YTD), significantly lower than its RM1.7 billion to RM2.9 billion contract wins in 2011 to 2013. The contract awards to the South Korean yards signal that Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) is now highly focused on cost control while SapuraKencana\\u2019s strong performance this year could be due to its integrated operation and strong management team. While we expect MHB to secure some RM1.2 billion to RM1.5 billion worth of contracts per year in 2015/16, we opine that its bids will need to be highly competitive, hence its profit margins may come under pressure. In the first half of this year, MHB undertook a mutual separation scheme involving 100 employees. We understand that Technip Malaysia, MHB\\u2019s strategic technical and project partner, is also undertaking a rightsizing exercise, signalling that the industry downturn and its impact on the joint venture may be more pronounced than we expected. Our economist has recently lowered our 2015E Brent crude price forecast to US$75 per barrel from US$85 per barrel on the large global oil production surplus and the Organisation of the Oil Producing Countries\\u2019 decision not to intervene in the oil market. The lower oil price has pressured Petronas to cut its 2015 capex by 15% to 20%. MHB, a domestic oil and gas company with single business focus, is vulnerable to lower domestic upstream capex. In view of the increasingly competitive domestic fabrication landscape and possible project delays due to uncertain oil price outlook, we have lowered our 2015/16E earnings per share forecast by 5% to 10%, imputing a lower new contract wins assumption of RM350 million for 2014E from RM500 million previously, and RM1.2 billion for 2015E from RM1.5 billion. We maintain our \\u201csell\\u201d rating with a lower target price of RM1.15 from RM1.50, pegging the stock at 12 times 2015 price-earnings ratio ([PER] from 15 times). Our target PER of 12 times is comparable to -1 standard deviation PER of 11.5 times. We opine that the potential entrance of a South Korean yard will permanently change the local fabrication landscape, pressuring margins and reducing the appeal of MHB. Also, MHB\\u2019s weak YTD contract wins, low order book backlog and the weak oil price will further weigh down its share price. \\u2014 Affin Hwang Capital Research, Dec 18  This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on December 22, 2014."}, "652": {"date_posted": "22/12/2014", "title": "Wah Seong to make and market Remcoat", "article": " Wah Seong Corp Bhd\n(Dec 19, RM1.24)\nAdd with a targer price of RM2.65: Petronas Technology Ventures Sdn Bhd (PTVSB) has inked a five-year exclusive licensing agreement with Wah Seong for the marketing rights of the former\\u2019s home-grown product, Remcoat, which offers three-layer protection for pipelines aged over 20 years.

In an announcement last week, the group says it had proposed to acquire a 50% stake in Blocks 01/97 and 02/97 (known as Cuu Long Basin), 36.8% in Block 46-CN (Cai Nuoc), and 40% in Blocks 10 and 11.1 (Nam Con Son Basin). The first two are oil and gas producing blocks while the third is an exploration block. Petronas is said to have put its stakes in the three blocks up for sale earlier this year. After the international bidding exercise, SapuraKencana entered into three conditional sales and purchase agreements with the national oil firm with regard to the assets. The Vietnam assets are estimated to have further upside as SapuraKencana will be able to ramp up production in the fields located in Cuu Long Basin as well as potentially make discoveries in the exploration field at Nam Con Son Basin. SapuraKencana president and group CEO Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin says in a statement that the transaction gives the group an immediate foothold in the promising oil provinces off the shores of Vietnam, with cash generating assets that will be earnings accretive to the group. He adds that the acquisition of interests in the three blocks marks a significant milestone for the group as it further strengthens its presence in Vietnam by adding exploration and production operations to its existing service operations. The values of the assets were first estimated by Wood Mackenzie, a firm that assesses oil blocks. In July, Wood Mackenzie released a report assessing the worth of only two fields in one of the blocks in the aforementioned Vietnam assets. The firm estimated that the Thang Long and Dong Do fields located in Block 01/97 and 02/97 will contribute total company cash flow of about US$480 million across a period of 12 years (from 2014 to 2025). The production sharing contract (PSC) concession for this block ends in 2028. However, the US$480 million, which will be pocketed by SapuraKencana, is only half of the deal. The Cuu Long Basin, where the Thang Long and Dong Do fields are located, also has another field called Ho Xam South. Wood Mackenzie did not take into consideration Ho Xam South or the other two blocks \\u2014 Cai Nuoc and Nam Con Son Basin \\u2014 since at the time of publication, the fields were either not producing or did not have concrete details. The Cuu Long Basin appears to be the gem in the asset as it has three oil-producing fields \\u2014 Thang Long, Dong Do and Ho Xam South. The fields were producing about 8,800 barrels of oil per day (bopd) in September and have total reserves of about 43 million barrels. In 2015, production is expected to be ramped up to 18,000 bopd. As for Cai Nuoc, it is a smaller field with less production. It is currently producing about 900 bopd and 23 million standard cu ft per day of gas. The field has been producing since 2003 and the PSC will expire in August 2015. An extension is subject to negotiation between SapuraKencana and Vietnam\\u2019s national oil firm PetroVietnam. Meanwhile, the potential discoveries and production of Nam Con Son Basin, which is an exploration field, are yet unknown, although some prospects have been identified. Assuming that SapuraKencana makes a discovery, it could add more worth to the total asset. The acquisition of the Vietnam assets contributes further to SapuraKencana\\u2019s already increasing reserves and resources. At the start of the year, SapuraKencana had reserves and resources of about 104 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe). After the five discoveries in SK408 announced in September, its reserves doubled to 208 mmboe. The integration of the Vietnam assets will now see SapuraKencana having total reserves and resources of 225 mmboe. Additionally, since the Vietnam assets are already producing oil, SapuraKencana is also expected to see its cash flow increase with time. According to Kenanga Research\\u2019s Cezzane See, \\u201cthe Vietnamese acquisition has producing assets, hence will translate into immediate cash flow that will be utilised to pay off the borrowings that come with the acquisition, which is 100% debt financed\\u201d. From a balance sheet perspective, See says the borrowings for the Vietnam fields will spur net gearing, but SapuraKencana is certain that payback will be swift given strong cash flows from the producing assets. See has given the stock an \\u201coutperform\\u201d rating with a target price of RM4.24. Maybank IB Research is of the view that the Vietnam blocks are quality assets as they are in production, and has given the stock a \\u201cbuy\\u201d recommendation and a target price of RM3.80. In a research report, it says the assets offer immediate cash flows and earnings visibility of about US$200 million earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) per annum over the next seven years. SapuraKencana\\u2019s share price closed at RM3.11 last Friday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM18.64 billion. Previously, Petronas\\u2019 Vietnam assets were speculated to have attracted big names such as tycoon Ananda Krishnan\\u2019s Pexco Group and Tan Sri Mokhzani Mahathir. In the May 22 issue of The Edge, sources said that Ananda was mulling over the listing of Pexco on Bursa Malaysia, should he acquire Petronas\\u2019 assets in Vietnam. Pexco is owned by Ananda\\u2019s privately held flagship, Usaha Tegas Sdn Bhd. Meanwhile, The Edge also reported that talk of Mokhzani\\u2019s interest in the assets stems from Yinson Holdings Bhd having a strong presence in Vietnam.

The duration of the contract is 36 months (effective December 2014 to December 2017). We are unsurprised by the news as we were aware that Dayang was pursuing this project, and we are positive as it signals a new source of income for the group. Management guidance is for margins to be in line with those currently being recorded by the group (20% to 23%), which is a premium to the rest of the industry margins, which typically stand in the single digits and/or low teens. We suspect the financial impact of this project will only be captured in financial year 2016 ending December (FY16) and FY17 as profits are typically backloaded.  Even though we are positive on the longer-term prospects of the company, we understand that we have been overly optimistic on the pace of the new HUC contracts for FY14/FY15. As such, we: (i) reduce the pace of both the Sarawak Shell and Petronas Carigali work; (ii) reduce our forecast FY15 earnings margins before interest and tax to 23% (from 24%) for the Pan-Malaysian HUC contracts; and (iii) reduce the associate contributions from Perdana as we have also fine-tuned our earnings on the latter. Overall, this reduces our FY14/FY15 net profit forecasts by 6.6% to 21.4%. We highlight that our estimates are at a 6.8% to 15.4% discount to consensus forecasts, but this is as we believe being conservative at this juncture is imperative. We have reduced our target 2015 price-earnings ratio (PER) to 10 times (from 12 times) in view of the continual sector derating. We have ascribed a premium over other small cap stocks (seven to nine times) given it is one of the Pan Malaysian HUC winners. We highlight that this valuation is close to Dayang\\u2019s historical -0.5 standard deviation level for the stock, while its trough PER valuation is six times.

If demand for commodities continues to slow next year, Southeast Asian markets are likely to suffer. According to Johanna Chua, managing director and head of Asia-Pacific economic and market analysis at Citi Research, US economic growth is at the opposing side of other regions such as the eurozone, Asia-Pacific and Japan. After years of maintaining near-zero-interest rates, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates next year as the US economy recovers. This situation is likely to drive up the dollar against other currencies, depressing commodity prices further, says Chua. \\u201cA strong dollar is not very good for commodity prices, unless we get a lot more action from China\\u2019s stimulus, which will drive up demand for commodities. If you look at the outlook on China, I don\\u2019t think the government is going to do a mega stimulus. \\u201cSo it is going to be a strong dollar environment, which is tougher for Asia to perform,\\u201d Chua says during a recent interview with selected Malaysian media. She expects the ringgit to settle at RM3.40 per dollar next year. The ringgit has depreciated 9.4% against the dollar to last Wednesday\\u2019s RM3.4425, from the year\\u2019s peak of RM3.1463 on Aug 27. According to Bloomberg data, the ringgit is expected to settle at RM3.36 per dollar by the end of 2015. Within Asia, markets with high yield currencies, such as the Indian rupee and Indonesian rupiah, will do relatively better than the rest, she says. This is because investors could borrow from a low interest rates countries, such as those in the eurozone or Japan, and invest in a market with higher yields. While the ringgit can be deemed as a high yield currency compared with the euro and yen, Citi Research does not have an \\u201coverweight\\u201d call on the Malaysian stock market due to the economy\\u2019s exposure to commodity prices such as crude oil, natural gas, palm oil and rubber. Nevertheless, Malaysia\\u2019s diversified economy, with almost one-third of its exports made up of electrical and electronics components, is expected to be less impacted by the low commodity prices, compared with some Latin American and African countries, says Chua. \\u201cThe good news about Malaysia is that you are not as commodity-centric as some Latin American countries. Malaysia\\u2019s economy is pretty diversified. Yes, it has commodities, but also a lot of manufactured goods. \\u201cSo the fact that the economy is diversified, unlike South Africa\\u2019s or Brazil\\u2019s, helps. But there will still be an impact from the low commodity prices on the economy and stock market,\\u201d she says. \\u00a0 The benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI has been under selling pressure since July, dropping by 6.8% to last Friday\\u2019s 1,749.37 points. The index dropped by over 4.2% between Nov 26 and last Wednesday, a period of five trading days. Selling pressure was exacerbated by Petronas\\u2019 CEO Tan Sri Shamsul Azhar Abbas\\u2019 comments that the national oil company may undertake a 15% to 20% cut on its planned capital expenditure next year, due to low crude oil prices. North Asia to do well, Indonesia to shine Within Asia, Chua says Citi Research is more bullish on the China story, on the back of its continued economic reform and rebalancing strategy. The firm is also bullish on Taiwan, as its export-dependent economy rides the US economic recovery. The low crude oil price is favourable to the economies of North Asia, which are huge consumers of the commodity. On the other hand, Southeast Asia will be impacted, as most [of its countries] are commodity exporters, and their prices move in tandem with crude oil. \\u201cWe are overweight on China; we think they are going to do more cyclical easing and a few more reforms going into next year. The valuations in Southeast Asia are not really cheap, and a lot of the growth is slowing down. \\u201cSo where do we see more [of a] growth story? Maybe China, maybe places with more quantitative easing, and we are also a little bit more positive on Taiwan, as a play on the US upcycle. It is more on North Asia than Southeast Asia,\\u201d says Chua. However, Chua expects Southeast Asian bond markets to still do well, due to the high yields they offer investors, as well as fuel price reforms in countries with big fuel subsidy bills, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, she notes. \\u00a0 \\u201cWe expect there is a demand for carry-on yield, and in Southeast Asia, yields are still pretty high in Indonesia. Our strategists have become a little more positive on the Indonesian story on the bond side, on the back of the fuel price reform there.\\u201d \\u00a0 Low crude oil prices will not impact government revenue The decision by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Nov 27 not to cut production suggests that crude oil prices will continue to remain low over the next 12 months. Petronas\\u2019 Shamsul forecasts crude oil prices to settle around US$70 (RM241.28) to US$75 per barrel next year, compared with the Malaysian government\\u2019s forecast of US$105 per barrel, as outlined in Budget 2015. Some parties have been calling for the Malaysian government to revise its Budget 2015, due to the substantially lower crude oil prices. Income from the petroleum industry amount to about 40% of the Federal government\\u2019s coffers. However, Chua is not so concerned about the impact of low crude oil prices on Malaysia\\u2019s government revenue. She says the impact of crude oil prices are more profound on Malaysia\\u2019s subsidy bill, rather than government revenue. \\u201cWe find petroleum-related revenues for Malaysia don\\u2019t seem to be responsive to low oil prices. I think the government is always very conservative when they do the budget, so they set a lower Tapis oil price, and there is always some room for manoeuvre with Petronas\\u2019 dividends. \\u201c[Government] revenue seems less sensitive to oil prices, but the subsidy bill seems to be more responsive. The deregulattion of RON 95 is very positive for long-term sustainability of fiscal and credit ratings,\\u201d she says. \\u00a0 Nevertheless, Chua says that low crude oil prices will impact natural gas prices. Malaysia, being one of the largest natural gas exporters in the world, will be impacted by the low prices of natural gas if crude oil prices continue to fall. \\u00a0 A wild card that could support crude oil prices is if China cuts its interest rates further next year. Investors are waiting for the People\\u2019s Bank of China to cut interest rates to support the country\\u2019s slowing economy. \\u201cThe real interest rate is getting higher and higher, and people are starting to worry that China is behind the curve. But when they finally cut the rates [on Nov 25], you see commodity prices went up, all the currencies rallied, so there was a little bit of a positive signal,\\u201d Chua says. \nThis article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on December 8-14, 2014."}, "658": {"date_posted": "16/12/2014", "title": "Dayang gains 3.39% on Petronas Carigali contract", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 16): Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd rose 3.39% in early trade on Tuesday after the company\\u2019s unit bagged a contract from Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd to provide brownfield services.

Last week, Yinson announced to Bursa Malaysia that Petronas had given its 30%-owned associate company, Yinson Energy Sdn Bhd (YESB), three licences. \\u00a0 They are for floating offshore facilities (SWEC SF2010000), mobile offshore facilities (SWEC SF2020000) and naval architecture and marine engineering (SWEC SE2010500). \\u00a0 Earlier this year, the potential licence awards were seen as a catalyst for Yinson to participate more in the domestic oil and gas industry. Globally, it is the sixth largest FPSO (floating production, storage and offloading) player in terms of fleet size. It has been active in Vietnam and West Africa but not on the home front as it did not have a Petronas licence to bid for jobs. However, the current depressed oil and gas market may see its development plan being shelved for the time being.

The rich PER is said to be backed by anticipated earnings growth in the financial years ending Jan 31, 2016 (FY2016) and FY2017, after it has realised the full potential of its current fleet of FPSOs. Still, with oil prices below US$80 per barrel, analysts do not see the Petronas licences doing Yinson much good in the near term. An industry analyst tells The Edge that the tumbling crude prices will cause oil companies to cut back on exploration, thus reducing the need for FPSOs. \\u201cOnly when new fields are discovered and enter the production phase will there be a need for new deployment of FPSOs.\\u201d Further, he points out that new FPSO contracts will likely have depressed rates because oil companies are expected to squeeze the rates for their internal rate of return (IRR). AmResearch\\u2019s Wong Joe Vuei, who has a \\u201chold\\u201d on Yinson and a fair value of RM2.97, also does not expect much from the Petronas licences in the near term. \\u201cWe do not expect Yinson to secure jobs within Malaysia anytime soon as project rollouts have been delayed or have slowed down recently amid the low oil prices. \\u201cWe note that Bumi Armada Bhd, which is the fifth largest FPSO player globally, is not operating any FPSO vessel in Malaysia currently.\\u201d Wong points out that a more attractive catalyst for Yinson is its ongoing bids for overseas projects. \\u201cCatalysts for the group stem from additional FPSO contracts, which the group is currently bidding for, in West Africa and Southeast Asia.\\u201d Nevertheless, the Petronas licences will open up new opportunities for Yinson on the home front. Apart from allowing the company to bid for Petronas jobs, the licences will also serve as strong credentials for the group,\\u00a0 say analysts. YESB was incorporated in September last year. It has an authorised share capital of RM100,000 and its initial issued and paid-up capital is RM1,000. The company\\u2019s principal activities include the provision of marine vessels for charter and marine services. According to a filing with the Companies Commission of Malaysia, Yinson holds 30% equity interest in YESB while two individuals, Rozlan Md Taha and Iftisham Abdul Aziz, hold a 35% stake each. Rozlan and Iftisham are also directors of YESB, together with Mat Sin Bidin, Choke Yoon Chuam, Tan Soo Leong, Yinson founder and executive chairman Lim Han Weng and Yinson executive director Bah Kim Lian. Lim is the major shareholder of Yinson with a 35.5% stake, followed by Tan Sri Mokhzani Mahathir\\u2019s Kencana Capital Sdn Bhd with 18.55% and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) with 5.83%. In view of the falling oil prices, the EPF has been trimming its holdings in Yinson in the past month. Its stake was as high as 6.2% on Oct 17. Yinson has grown substantially over the past few years and some quarters believe that the group will expand its business in the oil and gas\\u00a0 industry further. The game-changing acquisition of Fred Olsen Production (FOP) in June last year marked a turning point for the group. Currently, Yinson has an order book of US$3.7 billion (RM7.8 billion), which is expected to last it until 2023. The group, having leveraged Fred Olsen\\u2019s established presence in West Africa, is also the leading contender for a US$700 million to US$800 million Offshore Cape Three Points (OCTP) FPSO project off the coast of Ghana. After the acquisition of Fred Olsen, Yinson has grown immensely. In its financial year ended Jan 31, 2014 (FY2014), the group doubled its net profit to RM69.8 million from RM36.3 million in FY2013. Revenue nearly breached the RM1 billion mark at RM941.9 million in FY2014 from RM865.2 million in FY2013 while total assets grew to RM2.1 billion from RM800.9 million. In terms of fleet size, Yinson is just three vessels behind Bumi Armada. In Malaysia, Bumi Armada is the largest FPSO player with five FPSOs and three under construction, followed by Yinson with four FPSOs and one under construction.

For the most part of this calendar year, SapuraKencana has been trading sideways within the range of RM4-RM4.80.

Since its listing, SapuraKencana has been trading at a rolling four-quarter average price earnings ratio (PER) of 25 times.

The group\\u2019s main asset \\u2014 a fabrication yard \\u2014 is almost idle, and its other sizeable asset, a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel that is being refurbished, is only likely to generate earnings in the latter half of 2016. In a nutshell, if THHE does not bag a reasonably large fabrication job by the first quarter of next year, the group could be in some serious trouble as it only has some RM300 million worth of work left at the 60-acre fabrication yard in Pulau Indah. Against this backdrop, much of THHE\\u2019s fortunes hinges on the US$1 billion Central Processing Platform (CPP) job for the Baronia oil field off the coast of Sarawak by state-controlled Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas). However, judging by reports in international oil and gas publications, South Korea\\u2019s Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) seems to be the front runner for the CPP project, edging out THHE and its partner McDermott International Inc. In an exclusive interview with The Edge (see below), THHE\\u2019s managing director and CEO Nor Badli Munawir Mohamad Alias Lafti did not mince his words when explaining how important the Baronia CPP is to THHE. \\u201cIt\\u2019s critical in the sense that by June next year, our fabrication yard will be completely zero \\u2026 our yard will be zero. If you were to walk into our yard now, it\\u2019s [nearly] empty.\\u201d At present, THHE\\u2019s main fabrication contract is the RM250 million Kinabalu Non-Associated Gas (NAG) Topside project, which is due for completion in the third quarter of next year. Thus, THHE has to bag the Baronia CPP job or risk going through a quiet patch, as the next large-scale job from Petronas is the Sepat CPP, which is likely to be awarded only in the third quarter of next year. Of Petronas\\u2019 five CPP jobs that are up for grabs under its last capital expenditure plan, two \\u2014 SK-316 and Bergading \\u2014 have been awarded. SK-316 went to a joint venture between Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd (MMHE) with Technip and Bergading went to HHI. As for the third CPP job, Baronia, which is likely to be awarded soon, HHI is said to be the favourite to get it. It is only after Baronia has been awarded that Petronas will look at the CPPs for Sepat and Kasawari. For THHE, its partnership with US-based McDermott has not been fruitful, as possibly three out of five Petronas jobs have slipped their fingers. To recap, in late 2012, THHE inked an agreement with McDermott under which THHE acquired a 30% stake in Berlian McDermott Sdn Bhd while McDermott took up a 30% stake in TH Heavy Engineering Fabricators Sdn Bhd. Both deals were valued at an identical US$24.5 million each. Berlian McDermott is a company licensed to provide transportation and carry out installation for the oil and gas sector. It also owns a pipe-laying barge known as the DB30. TH Heavy Engineering Fabricators is a licensed Petronas fabricator. However, the main thrust of the partnership with McDermott was to bag CPP and related jobs. THHE\\u2019s other asset, the FPSO dubbed the Deep Producer 1 (formerly the 68,000 deadweight tonnage tanker MV Laurita), was acquired in July 2011 as a distressed asset at a cost of US$82.5 million \\u2014 about 40% of the US$200 million the previous owners spent building the vessel. However, the FPSO was not bought with a locked-in charter contract and only secured a RM1.2 billion job in May this year from JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration (M) Ltd for works in the Layang Development Project located in Block SK10, off the coast of Sarawak. The FPSO cost THHE about RM2 million a month to sustain when it was unchartered. However, now that it has secured a contract, the Deep Producer 1 is set to undergo a US$150 million to US$180 million conversion exercise so that it can be used in a gas field. Therefore, the FPSO will only start generating revenue in the latter half of 2016. Some analysts have downgraded THHE\\u2019s stock recently. For instance, Alliance DBS Research says, \\u201cTHHE\\u2019s earnings outlook for FY2015 is becoming increasingly challenging as order flow has been slow \\u2026 As such, we lower our new order win assumptions for FY2015 by RM200 million to RM500 million with the increasingly competitive landscape. This leads us to cut FY2015-16 forecast earnings by 18% to 26%.\\u201d With the cut in earnings estimates, Alliance DBS lowered its sum-of-parts-based target price to 65 sen from 95 sen previously. TH Heavy closed last Thursday at 59 sen, with a market capitalisation of RM677.6 million. Alliance DBS forecasts THHE raking in RM21 million in net profit from RM385 million in revenue for FY2014. For the six months to June this year, THHE suffered a net loss of RM4.5 million from revenue of RM206.8 million. Nor Badli explains that the operating environment has become increasingly challenging, with the number of licensed fabricators increasing from six to eight after Petronas awarded licences\\u00a0 to Sarawak-based KKB Engineering Bhd and Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd in 2013. Of the other six fabrication players \\u2014 other than SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd \\u2014 five are GLCs. They are Brooke Dockyard Sdn Bhd, Boustead Heavy Industries Corp Bhd, Labuan Shipyard & Engineering Sdn Bhd, MMHE and THHE. Despite the large number of GLCs, Petronas has been standing firm, awarding jobs hinged on nothing but price, which has not gone down well with many. \\u201cPetronas is the hand that feeds us, so we will just have to take it one step at a time. It\\u2019s like being punched but you still [have to] keep your chin up. There\\u2019s nothing much we can do. \\u201c(But) I wish Petronas had a different kind of policy, in which they allow foreign bidders to come, but gives priority to locals. So, if price is the criteria, perhaps get the locals to match it. Give us first right of refusal,\\u201d Nor Badli says. Since Tan Sri Shamsul Azhar Abbas took over the helm of Petronas as president and CEO in February 2010, the national oil firm has changed its approach. It stopped allocating fabrication jobs only to local players after it found that they had been overcharging the company by as much as 30%. \\u201cBecause of this overcharging, Petronas changed the mode. Now we don\\u2019t overcharge and we don\\u2019t get the jobs [either],\\u201d Nor Badli says. THHE, like many other disgruntled industry players, blames Petronas for its ailing financials \\u2014 but the oil major is unlikely to change its emphasis on costs any time soon.

Kenanga Research believes that certain oil and gas (O&G) stocks offer good bottom-fishing opportunities as values have started to emerge even after earnings downgrades. Its picks are Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd, Barakah Offshore Petroleum Bhd, Perdana Petroleum Bhd and SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd. Kenanga Research has ruled out the possibility of crude oil hitting US$40 (RM137) to US$50 per barrel as per market talks. \\u201cThis is because our simulation study reveals that the probability for it dipping below US$60 per barrel is remote with a probability of less than 10%,\\u201d it added. AllianceDBS Research analyst Arhnue Tan said earnings of O&G companies had met expectations in the recently concluded results season for the quarter ended Sept 30. She expects corporate fourth-quarter (4Q) earnings to remain intact as most of the companies have secured contracts which will be realised in 4Q14. \\u201cOur earlier forecast on the O&G sector remains unchanged in the short term,\\u201d Tan told The Edge Financial Daily yesterday. Nonetheless, she noted that she is still working on the new valuations for the sector for 2015 in view of the plunge in oil prices. Tan is advising investors to pick stocks that have strong fundamentals or heavily sold down O&G stocks such as SapuraKencana Petroleum, Dialog Group Bhd and Bumi Armada Bhd to capitalise on the recent sharp decline in their stock prices. \\u201cThese counters are fairly strong fundamentally and have large order books which may help them to pull through the difficult operating times. \\u201cFurthermore, these counters have a long-term earnings visibility and they are more resilient compared with other counters,\\u201d she added. But Tan remained cautious about the sector as she believes a recovery would not be immediate. \\u201cAs of now, I maintain a \\u2018neutral\\u2019 rating on the sector as there is no exact time frame for the recovery in crude oil.\\u201d O&G stocks regained some lost ground yesterday after the heavy selldown on Monday. Beaten-down shares such as Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas)-related stocks led the rebound, with Petronas Chemical Group Bhd emerging as the top gainer, up 7.21% to close at the day\\u2019s high of RM5.50 after falling 8.88% or 50 sen the day before. The FBM KLCI also recovered, rising 0.4% to 1,785.97 points yesterday. According to Reuters, Brent was unchanged at US$72.54 yesterday, while US crude was down 40 cents to US$68.60 a barrel. In its strategy report yesterday, CIMB Research head Terence Wong said it remains positive on the O&G sector, which should be a major winner riding on the Economic Transformation Programme (ETP) spending despite the 15% to 20% cutback in Petronas\\u2019 spending next year. \\u201cAssuming that our earlier forecast for Petronas\\u2019 capital expenditure (capex) in 2015 of RM60 billion (based on its average capex in 2012 and 2013) will be lowered by RM9 billion to RM12 billion to RM48 billion to RM51 billion, this will still be the highest annual capex prior to the implementation of the ETP. \\u201cIt also appears that the capex reduction will affect the downstream segment more than upstream, which forms the bulk of Petronas\\u2019 net profit and where most of the companies under our coverage operate,\\u201d said Wong.

Nevertheless, some analysts are calling a \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd (PetChem). Its share price has fallen 11.6% over the last one year to RM6.11 last Wednesday. Among the 23 analysts who cover PetChem, five are calling for a \\u201cbuy\\u201d, 11 a \\u201chold\\u201d and seven a \\u201csell\\u201d. The average target price is RM6.61 per share. \\u201cPetrochemicals are cyclical products, and their prices depend on supply and demand factors, besides crude oil prices. PetChem\\u2019s management is guiding for the prices of petrochemicals to increase going forward,\\u201d says an analyst with a local independent research house. \\u201cAt the current valuation of between 12 and 13 times estimated FY2015 earnings per share, PetChem is an attractive stock to buy into. It also has some of the best profit margins in the industry,\\u201d the analyst adds. According to Bloomberg, PetChem has an average price-earnings ratio of 16 times. According to Platts data released on Oct 16, Asian petrochemical prices have dropped sharply amid tumbling crude oil values due to concerns about global growth and demand, with aromatics such as paraxylene dropping to a four-year low. Paraxylene, an aromatic hydrocarbon derivative used for making plastic bottles and polystyrene products, contributed 13% to PetChem\\u2019s annual revenue for FY2014 ending Dec 31, as estimated by JP Morgan in a recent report. Paraxylene is included in olefins and derivatives products, which contributed about 70% to PetChem\\u2019s RM7.2 billion revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2014 (1HFY2014). \\u00a0 The spot price for paraxylene in Southeast Asia dropped to US$1,107.50 per metric ton in October, some 22.6% lower than the level in December last year, while methanol traded at US$405 per metric ton, compared with US$602.50 per metric ton. Asian paraxylene prices have been falling since late September due to the emergence of new start-ups in the region, according to Platts. Besides that, weak feedstock naphtha prices will also drive down paraxylene prices, added the global provider of energy, petrochemicals, metals and agriculture information. Producers are ramping up supply of paraxylene to take advantage of the low feedstock price, despite the still-sluggish demand for the product, says an industry source. Weak demand for polystyrene, a downstream product of paraxylene, also suppressed prices. Naphtha, a type of hydrocarbon primarily used as a feedstock to produce petrochemicals such as gasoline, bitumen and other olefins, was trading at US$81.09 per metric ton in October in Singapore, compared with US$106.84 last December. However, China\\u2019s imports of paraxylene jumped to 1.006 million metric tons in September, the highest since data was made publicly available in late 2007. Between January and September this year, China\\u2019s imports of paraxylene increased 5.2% year on year to 7.1 million metric tons. Methanol is estimated to contribute 16% to PetChem\\u2019s revenue in FY2014 ending Dec 31, according to JP Morgan\\u2019s estimate. Fertilisers, consisting of urea and ammonia, and methanol will contribute about 30% to PetChem\\u2019s annual revenue. Based on Bloomberg data, PetChem has higher earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margins compared with its peers. For FY2013, the company registered Ebitda margin of 33% compared with PTT Global Chemical PCL\\u2019s 9.93% for its FY2013 ended December and Sumitomo Chemical Co Ltd\\u2019s 9.65% for its FY2014 ended March. It is believed PetChem\\u2019s advantage over its peers is partly attributable to its parent, national oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd. While concurring that PetChem\\u2019s valuation is attractive at the moment, an analyst with TA Research says it is still not the time for investors to buy the stock. Investors should gauge its performance because of the execution issues at the company, she says. \\u201cBased on its track record, PetChem has not been able to execute well operationally. This can be seen in a number of plant shutdowns, some of which are not statutory at all in nature, as well as the gas supply issue.\\u201d Since it was listed in late 2010, PetChem\\u2019s plant utilisation rate peaked at 83% in FY2012, before dropping to 78% last year due to the start of major statutory plant turnarounds in the third quarter. Statutory plant turnarounds are periodic maintenance that is a required industry practice. The utilisation rate at its olefins and derivatives plants fell to about 65% in 2QFY2014. However, utilisation at it fertilizers and methanol plants increased to 85% in 2QFY2014 from 67% in the previous quarter as the group had resolved its gas supply issue. PetChem has plants in Gebeng, Kertih, Labuan, Bintulu, Gurun and Pasir Gudang. Last Thursday, PetChem reported declines of 9.7% and 27.2% in revenue and net profit to RM10.7 billion and RM1.96 billion respectively for the nine months ended Sept 30, due to lower volumes and prices. \\u00a0 According to Kenanga Research and RHB Research Institute, PetChem will do better in 2HFY2014 as the group has almost finalised its statutory plant turnaround, which started in the third quarter of last year. Kenanga Research\\u2019s Teh Kian Yong said in his research report dated Aug 12 that PetChem\\u2019s earnings is expected to recover from the second half, due to the end of the statutory plant turnarounds as well as improving product prices. Nevertheless, the cyclical nature of the petrochemicals industry causes PetChem\\u2019s share price to trade accordingly. There is also a lack of short-term catalyst for PetChem, says the TA Research analyst. The first capacity expansion through the Sabah Ammonia and Urea (SAMUR) plant will only be completed in 2016, as will the joint venture with BASF for the aromatic plant in Gebeng. While Petronas has kick-started job awards for the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) project in Pengerang, Johor, most of the contracts are for civil construction, earthwork and engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC). It is expected that PetChem will announce its own investment in the RAPID project. However, the impact on the group\\u2019s revenue and Ebitda will only materialise once the plant is fully operational, that is by 2019, according to analysts. The uncertainty over the direction of crude oil price has caused many investors to stay on the sidelines. Some remisiers say they would only consider PetChem if it falls below RM6. \\u00a0 Nevertheless, it seems the market has started to appreciate PetChem, as its share price has started to move up from its lowest one-year close of RM5.93 on Oct 21.

Bank of America Merril Lynch\\u2019s Asean economist Chua Hak Bin said the collapse in oil prices would impact the bottom-lines of Petronas and other O&G firms. It is estimated that every dollar change in oil price has a RM1 billion impact on Petronas\\u2019 pre-tax profit. \\u201cIt would also hurt investment activities,\\u201d he said in a note yesterday. In deeming the cut in Petronas\\u2019 capex in 2015 as \\u201cworse than expected\\u201d, Affin Investment Bank Research analyst Isaac Chow said other O&G companies may follow suit. \\u201cThis will translate into lower earnings and weaker investor appetite for the domestic O&G stocks,\\u201d he said in his report yesterday. However, the earnings impact may not be reflected immediately, but will likely be skewed towards late 2015, AllianceDBS Research analyst Tan Arhnue told The Edge Financial Daily. Nevertheless, analysts are of the view that O&G firms with strong order books are likely to prevail over falling crude oil prices. Chow prefers companies with integrated business models that have a good geographical spread, on top of a strong order book log. \\u201cAvoid single business stocks that may see earnings downgrade,\\u201d he advised. Public Investment Bank Research in a note yesterday warned that O&G firms could face long-term sustainability issues if they are solely reliant on Petronas awards. CIMB Investment Bank Research analyst Norziana Mohd Inon said one of her preferred stocks is SapuraKencana due to its \\u201cgood leverage\\u201d in the international and regional markets. She maintained her \\u201cadd\\u201d rating on the stock with an unchanged target price of RM6.84. Comparatively, she maintained her \\u201coverweight\\u201d call on the O&G sector. Aviation stocks, however, gained on the prospect of cheap jet fuel on falling oil prices. Analysts said the lower crude oil prices are a boon for airline companies, with expectation of higher earnings. AllianceDBS aviation analyst Tan Kee Hoong pointed out that airlines will benefit from savings on fuel cost, which will translate into lower fuel surcharges for consumers. On ceteris paribus, AirAsia Bhd and AirAsia X Bhd would save an additional RM18 million and RM12 million respectively in FY15 and FY16 for every US$1 cut in jet fuel price, Tan added. MIDF Research analyst Chua Boon Kian concurred, saying the current scenario bodes well for airlines as fuel expense makes up 45% to 50% of the two airlines\\u2019 operational expenditure. \\u201cIt will save them substantial operational expenses to report higher earnings,\\u201d he said. Chua expects AirAsia and AIrAsia X to announce higher earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 (1Q14) and 1Q15. Shares in AirAsia closed up 8.14% or 21 sen to RM2.79 yesterday, emerging as the top three biggest gainers, while AirAsia X\\u2019s share price fell 1.48% or one sen to 66.5 sen. \\u00a0 This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on December 2, 2014."}, "680": {"date_posted": "1/12/2014", "title": "Malaysia, Singapore fall on weak oil prices", "article": " BANGKOK (Dec 1): Malaysia's key stock index marked the worst drop in almost 23 months and Singapore's benchmark posted the biggest fall since mid-October on Monday as oil and gas stocks tumbled amid a fall in global oil prices to a five-year low. \\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\nKuala Lumpur's composite index, which measures moves of 30 large-cap stocks, closed down 2.3 percent, its biggest single day loss since January 21, 2013.

For the nine-month period, net profit grew 21.3% to RM254.7 million from RM209.9 million in the same period last year, while revenue surged 43.6% to RM2.06 billion from RM1.44 billion previously. On higher revenue, the group attributed to the higher work progress from its ongoing development projects. Mah Sing achieved property sales of about RM2.45 billion for the nine-month period, as it focused on the mass market properties at the right locations, in line with market demand. On prospects for the current financial year, Mah Sing said the Greater Kuala Lumpur market is expected to be sustainable. This is especially in the new growth corridors benefiting from ongoing and proposed transportation infrastructure projects, such as the MRT, LRT and the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high speed rail projects. Meanwhile, the group has proposed a warrant-sweetened rights issue to raise RM630 million and a one-for-four bonus issue, for land acquisition and property development activities. From the RM630 million, RM370 million has been ear-marked as part-payment for land in Negeri Sembilan and Puchong, said Mah Sing in a separate filing with the stock exchange. Mah Sing said the RM370 million will be used to replenish a previous payment made for the Seremban and Puchong land, as well as to fund payments over the next 12 months. The proposed rights issue and bonus issue are expected to complete by the first quarter and third quarter next year respectively, following approvals and barring any unforeseen circumstances.

The group is in the midst of finalising three collaborative agreements with a London-based safety and survival equipment manufacturer. Its subsidiary Vanguard Composite Engineering Pte Ltd will have access to an enlarged pool of customers globally, according to a source familiar with the company. The first agreement will provide Vanguard with a distribution channel for its lifeboats and lifeboat hooks in Europe, the US and Africa. Vanguard currently has a presence in Asia-Pacific, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and the Americas. \"This will strengthen Vanguard\\u2019s foothold in existing markets and expand its reach on a global scale as it will now be able to increase the supply of its products overseas. This will also expand the group\\u2019s revenue base,\\u201d says the source. He adds: \"On average, Vanguard supplies 100 lifeboats a year. which translates into revenue of S$15 million (RM38.6 million). With the collaboration with the foreign company, it may see an additional 30 to 40 lifeboats a year, which will add S$4 million to S$5 million to its revenue.\\u201d To recap, Destini acquired a 51% stake in Singapore-based Vanguard for RM10 million in 2012. Currently, Destini is planning to buy out the remaining 49% stake in Vanguard for RM26 million by year-end. The equity interest is presently held by a Singaporean businessman Ng Tuck Whye. The source reveals that Destini\\u2019s new partner will be working with its two other wholly-owned subsidiaries, Destini Prima Sdn Bhd and TF Corp Pte Ltd, which are part of its marine division, on an agreement. This second agreement will give Destini the right to distribute and maintain the London-based firm\\u2019s liferafts for commercial use in Malaysia, he says. Currently, Destini is only authorised to distribute and maintain life rafts for the country\\u2019s defence sector. Once the agreement is inked \\u2014 expected to be by end-month \\u2014 the group will be able to distribute and maintain life rafts for the oil and gas and shipping industries as well. \\u201cThis will open up Destini\\u2019s life raft market within Malaysia. The group will, later on, be able to distribute life rafts commercially to shipping companies and Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u2019s (Petronas) oil platforms,\\u201d says the source. The third agreement will see the London-based firm referring its clients to Singapore-based TF Corp for the maintenance of lifeboats and other life-saving equipment. This is expected to increase the group\\u2019s marine maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) activities. Note that Destini has three main business segments. The marine division contributes 30% to the group\\u2019s revenue while another 30% comes from its aviation MRO division, which is awaiting certification by the European Aviation Safety Agency to enable Destini to secure commercial aviation jobs. The remaining 40% is derived from its oil and gas division, which is led by Samudra Oil Services Sdn Bhd. It was acquired by the group for RM80 million earlier this year. Samudra Oil is one of the group\\u2019s main earnings contributors, as reflected in Destini\\u2019s 2QFY2014 net profit, which more than doubled to RM1.23 million from RM514,000 in the previous corresponding period. Revenue was also higher at RM36.81 million from RM22.73 million. For the first half of the year, the group saw a net profit of RM4.31 million as compared with RM2.92 million previously, on the back of a revenue of RM65.88 million, from RM39.07 million previously. Since it has been lifted from PN17 classification, Destini\\u2019s share price has been on an uptrend, reaching a five-year high of 74 sen on June 30 this year. This represents a 128% jump from the one-year low of 32.5 sen on Oct 22 last year. The stock closed at 50 sen last Thursday. UOB Kay Hian initiated coverage on Destini on June 16 with a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call and a target price of 87 sen, which implies a FY2015 forecast price earnings ratio (PER) of 13.2 times. \\u201cOur valuation has taken into account the enlarged share base due to the issuance of warrants and new shares for the Vanguard acquisition. Our target price implies an upside of 32.8% from its current share price,\\u201d it says. UOB forecasts that Destini\\u2019s earnings will leap fourfold in FY2014, underpinned by a nine-month earnings contribution from Samudra Oil and full-year earnings contributions from TF Corp and Vanguard. \\u201cFor FY2015, our projected earnings growth of 59% took into account the full-year contribution from Samudra Oil\\u2019s tubular handling business and the respective earnings growth of 10% and 62% from the marine and aviation MRO businesses,\\u201d UOB adds.

The ringgit was weaker against the US dollar at RM3.35 per dollar as compared with RM3.33 a week ago. Technically, the trend has turned bearish. First, it failed to break and stay above the long-term 200-day moving average (MA) and downtrend line three weeks ago. Now, the index declined below the short-term 30-day MA last week. However, the index rebounded from the support level we anticipated last week at 1,810 points, which is the 50% retracement level of the bullish trend that started in mid-October. The price rebounded yesterday after testing and breaking below the support level to close at 1,806.48 points on Monday. The rebound yesterday indicates that there is support on the 50% retracement level. However, the momentum is bearish as the momentum oscillators like RSI and Momentum Oscillator fell below its mid-level. Furthermore, the index has also fallen below the middle band of the Bollinger Bands indicator. The index has now retraced to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the bullish trend that started in mid-October. The index has rebounded from this level but it has to increase further to boost market confidence. The rebound may be capped at the immediate resistance level at 1,830 points. However, we expect the index to decline to the psychological level at 1,800 points if the index failed to rebound.  \nBenny Lee is chief market strategist for Jupiter Securities Sdn Bhd.

It is providing pipes, valves and fittings (PVF) to the development project. But will there be more jobs for Pantech after PIC? The group\\u2019s executive director Adrian Tan tells The Edge in an interview that once the construction of PIC\\u2019s facilities are completed, Pantech will look forward to providing maintenance of the complexes, which will provide recurring income to the oil and gas group. At present, 40% of the group\\u2019s business is from the maintenance and replacement market of PVFs. Maintenance jobs from PIC \\u2014 commencing 2020 \\u2014 should add to Pantec\\u2019s bottomline. \\u201cIt is something that we think is within our reach \\u2026 We are working very hard towards it,\\u201d says Tan. These maintenance jobs, if they transpire, would result in earnings over and above the supply contracts that the group would be able to win over the next five years. A report from Alliance DBS Vickers explains that if 5% of the RM87 billion project is for PVF and if Pantech secures 2% of that, this would translate into RM1.7 billion in supply contracts for PIC. The remaining 3% would be outsourced from overseas by the engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC) contractors. It is interesting to note that in its recent financial report on Bursa Malaysia, Pantech states that the group has managed to secure its first supply package for Rapid (refinery and petrochemical integrated development) for an undisclosed client and amount. Its impact on the company\\u2019s financials remains to be seen. Pantech registered net profits of RM26.98 million for first half of FY2015 from RM29.06 million previously. Revenue came in lower at RM272 million against RM316.08 million a year ago. In contrast to the corresponding period a year ago, net profits were down about 7% while revenue dipped almost 14%. In a report by RHB Research, Jerry Lee says that Pantech\\u2019s outlook remains bright for the longer term. \\u201cWith its improved margin, we are confident that its earnings could rise to new highs once oil and gas activities begin to pick up again,\\u201d says Lee. The research house has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on Pantech with a target price of RM1.25 based on a 12 times FY15 forecast price-earnings ratio (PER) of 9.3 times. Kenanga Research, on the other hand, which has an \\u201coutperform\\u201d call on the stock with a target price of RM1.23, notes that the sector has undergone some de-rating with low crude oil prices and sluggishness in the global economy. \\u201cHowever, we believe Pantech is well positioned in the downstream segment, which will continue to shine in the medium-term as Petronas goes all out to ensure the success of the Rapid project,\\u201d says Kenanga. While its prospects at PIC seem bright, Tan adds that Pantech will not be overly dependent on Rapid. He says that in the five years till the commencement of the Rapid contracts, there would be new opportunities and projects for Pantech to take part in. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not like we are just harping on PIC or Rapid,\\u201d says Tan. Without disclosing details, Tan adds that the group is also able to provide its high-temperature products to power plants. In fact, Pantech has been supplying valves to Malakoff Corp Bhd. Note that Malakoff is a 51%-owned subsidiary of MMC Corp Bhd, which was awarded the EPCC for PIC\\u2019s co-generation power plant through a tie up between its unit, MMC Engineering Services Sdn Bhd, and Siemens Malaysia. Pantech\\u2019s trading division saw higher earnings during the period due to stronger sales demand and better contributions from its overseas subsidiary. Its manufacturing division saw lower earnings due to a decrease in output and export sales demand. Tan says its trading division will see increased activity in the quarters to come, hinging on the development of Rapid. \\u201cRight now, everything is running on Rapid. I would say that Rapid could be reflected in the second half of the current financial year (2HFY2015)\\u201d. On its manufacturing side, Tan says that the group is limited by capacity. \\u201cDifferent factories have different capacities. I would say that we are the biggest in Malaysia in terms of capacity,\\u201d he adds, pointing out that Pantech has a 40% market share in the country. Pantech saw its shares priced at an all time high of RM1.11 on July 17 this year after jumping 30.29% from a one-year low of 85 sen on March 28. Its shares closed 13.26% lower at 97 sen last Friday, with a market capitalisation of RM579.5 million. On the recent oil and gas industry slump, Tan is of the view that investors should take a long-term perspective. \\u201cIf you take a short-term view of oil and gas, you either make money very fast or lose money very fast,\\u201d he says.

Dialog Group Bhd (Dialog) has entered into a shareholders agreement with Petronas Gas Bhd (PGas) in relation to a RM2.7 billion development of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) regasification facilities at Pengerang, Johor. The project, according to Dialog, is to develop a regasification unit and two units of 200,000 m3 LNG storage tanks with an initial send out capacity of 3.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of natural gas. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Dialog said it was entered into the SHA with PGas through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Dialog LNG Sdn Bhd (Dialog LNG) and Pengerang LNG (Two) Sdn Bhd (PLNG-2). Dialog said PLNG-2 will act as the special purpose vehicle to undertake the aforesaid project. \"PLNG-2 will be restructured whereby PGas will acquire 65% in PLNG-2 with Dialog LNG to hold 25% and the State Secretary, Johor (Incorporated) to hold the remaining 10%,\" the filing read. On the funding, Dialog said it would be satisfied by equity injection, shareholders loan and external borrowings. \"The Pengerang LNG project is expected to provide additional sources of long\nterm sustainable and recurring income in the future for Dialog,\" it said, adding that it will also synergise with the group's investment in petroleum and petrochemical storage terminals in Pengerang, Kertih and Tanjung Langsat. In a separate filing, PGas said the project is expected to commence construction by second quarter next year and to achieve commercial operations date by fourth quarter of 2017. Dialog closed at RM1.56 today giving it a market capitalisation of RM7.69 billion while PetGas inched up 20 sen to close at RM21.66, translating into a market capitalisation of RM42.86 billion. AirAsia Bhd expects strong growth next year in anticipation of lower fuel costs and airfares will generate higher demand for the low-cost airline's services. Group CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes said airfares had risen about 11%, which was deemed substantial. But the current backdrop of cheaper jet fuel has lifted AirAsia's optimism to lower fares whilst stimulating more demand, moving forward, according to Fernandes. \"2015 will be one of our best years, coupled with all our ancillary initiatives that we have launched, like our WiFi, where we see almost 40% of our passengers using the service when they fly, including our duty-free products that we have launched. \"If oil prices continues to go down, maybe we can get rid of oil surcharges, and that will stimulate more people to fly\" Fernandes said. Air Asia closed four sen or 1.6% lower at RM2.46, translating in a market capitalisation of RM6.85 billion. Holders of Sistem Lingkaran-Lebuhraya Kajang Sdn Bhd's (Silk) Islamic bonds or sukuk had approved the sale of Silk Holdings Bhd's entire stake in the highway operator to IJM Corp Bhd for RM395 million cash. Silk Holdings said in a filing to Bursa Malaysia, the approval was secured at the company's bondholder meeting today. The sukuk holders also released Silk Holdings from its obligation under the corporate guarantee for the sukuk, the company said. Holders of Silk's RM2 billion sukuk include CIMB Bank Bhd, Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd and Etiqa Takaful Bhd. Silk is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Silk Holdings Bhd and the concession holder for the 37km Kajang Silk Highway. The highway links the northern and southern parts of Kajang, Selangor. Silk Holdings is selling toll expressway to unlock the value of its investment in Silk. The sale will enable Silk Holdings to concentrate on growing its oil & gas support-services business. Silk closed at 83.5 sen, four sen or 5% higher today with 10.03 million shares traded. With the closing price, it has a market capitalisation of RM585.78 million. Three-A Resources Bhd recorded a net profit of RM4.68million in the third quarter ended Sept 30, up 163% from RM1.78million a year ago due to lower material and finance costs. Earnings per share (EPS) grew to 1.19 sen from 0.45 sen a year ago. In an announcement to Bursa Malaysia today, the soy food manufacturer attributed improved profit to lower materials and finance costs plus higher operational efficiency. Furthermore, there was an impairment of trade receivables in the previous corresponding quarter. However, the revenue for 3Q14 dropped slightly by 2.4% to RM72.96million from RM74.77million last year, as a result of lower sales of the group's products ranging from soy sauce to glucose syrup. The stock closed 0.5 sen lower at 92 sen, giving it a market capitalisation of RM362.11 million. Malaysia's largest Islamic fund manager, Lembaga Tabung Haji (Tabung Haji), has been accumulating shares in BIMB Holdings Bhd (BIMB) in the past week, and now holds a 54.5% equity stake in the bank. A filing with Bursa Malaysia showed Tabung Haji had bought a total of 6.12 million shares over five transactions between Nov 7 and 13 when BIMB's share price was on the decline. The latest shopping spree brings Tabung Haji's stake in BIMB to 54.5% or 814.03 million shares. BIMB's share continued a week-long downward trend to close at RM1.15, down three sen. This gives BIMB a market capitalisation of RM6.19 billion. Tomypak Holdings Bhd (Tomypak) saw its net profit suffered in the third quarter ended Sep 30, 2014 (3Q14). The flexible packaging manufacturer's earnings was almost halved to RM2.23 million year-on-year, from RM4.02 million the same period last year. Revenue for the quarter declined 11.6% year-on-year to RM51.57 million from RM58.3 million in 3Q13. Earnings per share (EPS) clocks in at 2.04 sen compared to 3.68 sen the same time last year. Despite the sharp drop on earnings, Tomypak declares dividend per share of one sen, bringing the total amount of dividend for FY14 to four sen so far. Moving forward, Tomypak believed that the demand for the group's products from the food and beverage sector will increase. \"With the anticipated growth in sales revenue, the group had purchased an industrial land for future expansion purpose,\" it added. Tomypak's share price has also been drifiting lower, shedding 11 sen or 7.8% year-to-date.\\u00a0 Today, it closed unchanged at RM1.30 to give it a market capitalisation of RM142.1 million."}, "698": {"date_posted": "14/11/2014", "title": "GE O&G to supply turbomachinery for Petronas\\u2019 FLNG facility", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: New York Stock Exchange-listed GE Oil & Gas (GE O&G) said it will supply its gas turbine-driven compressor train and mechanical drive technology to Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) for the latter\\u2019s second floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility that is being developed off East Malaysia.

The Edge understands that the contract is a part of the Spanish company\\u2019s RM4 billion engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC) job in the refinery and steam cracker component of RAPID that was awarded in August this year. \\u201cIf all goes well, Muhibbah could seal part of the EPCC job before year-end,\\u201d a source says. There are scant details of the potential award by T\\u00e9cnicas Reunidas but the contract could nudge Muhibbah\\u2019s order book to an all-time high of almost RM2.5 billion. According to Kenanga Research, Muhibbah\\u2019s outstanding order book stands at RM1.93 billion, comprising RM875 million from construction, RM1.02 billion from its crane division (Favelle Favco Bhd) and RM38 million from its shipyard division. This will keep the group busy until 2016. Kenanga, which has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d recommendation on the group, says Muhibbah\\u2019s year-to-date contract wins amount to RM378 million or 54% of its financial year 2014 (FY2014) new jobs assumption of RM700 million. \\u201cWe reiterate our view that the remaining RM300 million to RM500 million new jobs will be secured by the group before end-FY2014, likely from oil and gas, that is Petronas-related projects such as RAPID.\\u201d This indicates that the award of the EPCC contract by T\\u00e9cnicas Reunidas is not entirely unexpected. In its notes accompanying its financial results for the first half of this year, Muhibbah says, \\u201cThe group, with its experience and track record in the oil and gas sector, is hopeful of securing some of the related oil and gas engineering and construction works from RAPID.\\u201d It is worth noting that Muhibbah has bulked up its order book with several contracts secured this year. Last month, it won a RM157 million job for the design, construction and completion of Phase 1 of the conveyor system facility for the proposed Samalaju Port project in Bintulu, Sarawak, from Bintulu Port Holdings Bhd. Also in September, the company was awarded a two-year, RM100 million contract for the construction, fabrication and installation of the new Aroma Chemical Complex along with relevant facilities for the Lemongrass project in Kuantan, Pahang, by BASF Petronas Chemicals Sdn Bhd. In August, Muhibbah got a RM30 million contract for the fabrication, loadout and seafastening of jackets, piles and appurtenances for a central processing platform to be installed on Vestigo\\u2019s Tembikai oilfield off the peninsula. In May, it bagged from Samsung Engineering (M) Sdn Bhd the RM61.4 million civil and building works for the Terengganu Gas Terminal project. A few months before that, it was awarded a RM30 million steel structure erection job by JGC (M) Sdn Bhd for Petronas\\u2019 LNG Train 9 project in Bintulu. \\u00a0 Interestingly enough, Muhibbah may be involved in the fabrication aspect of the RAPID contract. In June last year, Petronas licensed it as an approved supplier for \\u201coffshore facilities construction-major onshore fabrication\\u201d. The licence has put Muhibbah on a whole new level as it can now bid for and participate in construction and fabrication works for Petronas and other major oil companies in the country, which augurs well for its earnings. For the first half of FY2014 ended June 30, Muhibbah registered a net profit of RM41.1 million on revenue of RM860.1 million. A year ago, net profit was flat at RM40.5 million, although revenue rose 8.4% from the previous corresponding period. Kenanga estimates Muhibbah\\u2019s FY2014 net profit at RM87.4 million and revenue at RM1.62 billion, and has a target price of RM3.55 for the company, which implies a forward price-earnings ratio (PER) of 14.6 times FY2015 earnings. This is still within its mid-sized construction peers\\u2019 historical PER of 12 to 15 times. Muhibbah has not been spared the effects of the recent turbulence in the global stock markets and has been spiralling down like other oil and gas stocks. Since hitting its 52-week high of RM3.43 in July this year, Muhibbah\\u2019s shares have fallen 19.8%. The counter closed at RM2.75 last Thursday. Says Kenanga, \\u201cWe continue to like Muhibbah for its unique business structure that offers flexibility in infrastructure, marine engineering and oil and gas jobs, the ability to leverage its internationally recognised Favelle Favco name and long-term earnings visibility backed by stable and growing recurring income from its concessions.\\u201d This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on October 20 - 26, 2014."}, "701": {"date_posted": "13/11/2014", "title": "Yinson gains 3% after associate secures licenses", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (November 13): Yinson Holdings Bhd gained as much as 3% after the group obtained three new licenses from Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas), which will allow Yinson to participate in tenders for works relating to the licenses for Petronas and other oil and gas operators in Malaysia.

The company, which is 55% controlled by UMW Holdings Bhd, encountered choppy waters prior to its flotation exercise on Bursa Malaysia on Nov 1 last year. In a nutshell, the shifting of its business focus \\u2014 from pipe manufacturing to exploration and drilling via jack-up rigs \\u2014 has bode well for UMW O&G. For the first six months of the financial year ended June 30, 2014, it posted a net profit of close to RM114 million and revenue of RM434.3 million. Despite reporting better financial results at end-August, the company has been badly hit by negative market sentiment. The stock has shed almost 21% to RM3.20, from RM4.05 on Aug 22. However, UMW O&G CEO Rohaizad Darus tells The Edge that he is unperturbed by the selldown and is prepared for such downturns. \\u201cI look at the downturn [in the industry] positively. We are fundamentally strong as a company, with good contracts and marketable new rigs, so I believe we should be able to weather the storm,\\u201d he says. He adds that the group is prepared for such uncertainties, with its development hinging on three strategies \\u2014 having more clients globally, thus not relying on any one single client, expanding into more countries so as not to be dependent on a single market, and establishing good relationships with clients and leveraging on these relationships to secure future jobs. \\u201cWith these strategies, we are not only addressing the growth of the company but also managing the exposure to risks in the event of a slowdown,\\u201d he explains. Rohaizad says there are still various opportunities available in the O&G market for the company to capitalise on. \\u201cDuring the storm, the industry will consolidate as there are companies that may not be able to sustain their operations. This opens the door to possible acquisitions.\\u201d He notes that it will be a buyer\\u2019s market when the industry is consolidating. \\u201cIf the opportunity presents itself at the right price, why not?\\u201d UMW O&G may consider companies that are also in the drilling business \\u2014 not necessarily limited to jack-up rigs businesses \\u2014 and those with semi-submersible ships, drillships or tender rigs, says Rohaizad. \\u201cWe are close to becoming a regional player and we are actively looking at the Middle East, North Sea and Australasia [as part of our plan] to become a global player in 10 years.\\u201d Rohaizad says it is essential for UMW O&G to continue adding more rigs to its fleet even with the sluggish market as building rigs during a peak cycle would be more costly. \\u201cWe are only two weeks into this uncertainty in the O&G market, so we have not seen the effects yet. But if this continues, then I believe we can get rigs at a cheaper price from the yard.\\u201d At end-June this year, UMW O&G had deposits, cash and bank balances of almost RM1.1 billion. On the other side of the balance sheet, its short-term borrowings amounted to almost RM1.1 billion while long-term debt commitments were RM425.2 million. UMW O&G, Rohaizad says, is maintaining its long-term plan of getting a minimum of one rig per year and expanding its business. \\u201cWe are not going to slow down our international development or stop adding more rigs to our fleet due to the uncertainty in the market.\\u201d He remarks that the perception that rigs tend to be chartered out at lower rates during a slow period is flawed. \\u201cIt also depends on the type of rigs,\\u201d he says, adding that demand and rates for jack-up rigs are stable, while rates for semi-submersible ships and ultra-deepwater rigs are declining. While many expect the market to soften, Rohaizad says UMW O&G will see sustainable future demand due to the small-scale field projects in Malaysia and regionally. Currently, there are 105 small-scale fields in Malaysia, which are divided into 24 clusters. Out of the 24, only six have been awarded through risk-sharing contracts. The six are the Berantai field, Balai-Bentara cluster, Kapal-Banang-Meranti cluster, Tembikai-Chenang cluster, Tanjong Baram field and Ophir field. \\u201cThere are 18 more small-scale fields available. We don\\u2019t know when Petronas will develop the fields, but as long as Malaysia still relies on oil for its economy, it has to develop these fields,\\u201d says Rohaizad. UMW O&G had an order book of RM2.1 billion as at Aug 31. This comprises two long-term contracts lasting until 2018 for two rigs (Naga 1 and Naga 4), while the remaining rigs (Naga 2, Naga 3, Naga 5 and Naga 6) will see their short-term contracts expiring next year. The company\\u2019s bid book is at US$1.8 billion (RM5.9 billion) for 23 bids comprising both short-term and long-term contracts located locally and regionally.

In Oslo, many big marine businesses are listed on the exchange \\u2014 we have the global standing to join them.\\u201d Nam Cheong prides itself on having grabbed about 15% of the global OSV market this year by delivering 30 of the world\\u2019s total OSV production, estimated at 150 to 200 vessels. Next year, it will deliver 35 OSVs. Nam Cheong claims to have a 7% market share of OSVs in this region and is the second largest player east of the Suez Canal. It also claims to have a strong reputation in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, West Africa and the US for \\u201cits expertise and track record in constructing OSVs\\u201d primarily for shipowners and marine service operators. Apart from orders from Malaysian firms, Nam Cheong has clinched orders from Mexico, Brazil, the Middle East, India and West Africa. It recently added Indonesia to the list. Some of its longstanding customers are major oil and gas players such as Bumi Armada Bhd, Petra Perdana Bhd, Topaz, Borcos Shipping, Vroon, PetroVietnam, SapuraKencana Petroleum and Tidewater. The company has benefited from the government\\u2019s \\u201clocal-content\\u201d policy and Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u2019s RM300 billion, five-year capital expenditure programme for 2011-2015. This programme has provided jobs for OSV operators, many of which are Nam Cheong clients. Unsurprisingly, Nam Cheong derives about 50% of its revenue from Malaysia. Prior to 2005, all of its revenue came from the local market. Currently, its OSV market share in Malaysia is still high, at around 75%, according to its estimates. Though Leong says Nam Cheong is not under pressure from the Malaysian authorities to list on Bursa, its recent fast growth may compel it to expedite this process. Indeed, its OSV orders shot up after the implementation of Petronas\\u2019 programme. Nam Cheong sold 13 OSVs in 2012 and 20 in 2013. This year, sales are expected to surge by 50% to 30 OSVs and are projected to hit a company-high of 35 next year. Nam Cheong has delivered over 100 vessels to local and international clients since 2007. However, the company has not set itself a time frame for listing. \\u201cWe are not in a rush. The listing is not meant to raise funds from the capital market, but is more for branding and improving liquidity and investor perception. We have done all that is needed [to raise funding for expansion] in Singapore.\\u201d Leong says investors can expect a better set of financials this year and next, due to the sharp rise in the company\\u2019s OSV orders and deliveries. In the first half of 2014, revenue rose 54% to RM786 million and profit after tax (PAT) jumped 75% to RM134 million. For the full financial year of 2014, revenue is expected to hit RM1.827 billion and PAT a company-high of RM266 million. According to a consensus of eight research houses compiled by Bloomberg, revenue will rise to RM2.181 billion and PAT to\\u00a0 RM308 million in FY2015. \\u00a0 Leong says the company hopes to achieve an annual growth of 20% to 30% over the next five years. This is based on international forecasts that expect regional and global demand for shallow water OSVs to remain high despite the current softening in crude oil prices. Despite rapid growth, Nam Cheong has a healthy balance sheet with a gearing ratio of 0.6%. Leong says the company is in a \\u201ccomfortable position\\u201d to benefit from robust growth in the OSV segment \\u201cdue to quality, reliability and track record\\u201d in the delivery of vessels and the confidence in the company of its repeat customers. He attributes the success of Nam Cheong to the foresight and boldness of its 72-year-old founder and chairman, Tiong, who actively leads the group while engaging in other businesses. Tiong, who is Fuchow and hails from Sibu in Sarawak, started Nam Cheong with a capital of about RM40 in 1968 to build boats in Miri. The market capitalisation of Nam Cheong now stands at more than RM2 billion. \\u201cDatuk Tiong was key in propelling the company forward. In 2006, he decided to move our manufacturing model to build-to-stock (BTS) from build-to-order. This enables delivery to take place within six months rather than 18 to 24 months,\\u201d says Leong, who is a son-in-law of the chairman. With BTS, Nam Cheong builds ahead of estimated demand. Leong says the company has a track record of selling all of its BTS vessels planned for any one year, even during the past financial crises. \\u201cWe have gone through many down cycles and demonstrated our ability to read market demand. Since 2007, we have had an impeccable track record of selling all pre-built vessels prior to delivery,\\u201d says Leong. Due mainly to its BTS model and its outsourcing of shipbuilding to China at lower cost, Nam Cheong has consistently enjoyed a gross profit margin of 15%-20%, which is double that of conventional shipbuilding. Leong says although Tiong controls 60% of Nam Cheong, he ensures the company is professionally run. Half of its board of directors comprises accountants and lawyers. The shipbuilder bagged two major awards in Singapore last year for \\u201cThe Best Managed Board\\u201d and \\u201cThe Most Transparent Company\\u201d. With its charter business accounting for only 5% of its revenue, Tiong wants Nam Cheong to stay focused on being a specialised OSV builder. It has no plans to diversify into other segments, according to Leong. \\u00a0\\u201cDatuk Tiong is very conservative. We will not do what we don\\u2019t know well. He emphasises honesty and integrity in doing business. For example, in our charter business, we will not compete with our customers. We will only go into areas they are not in.\\u201d This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on October 20 - 26, 2014."}, "706": {"date_posted": "11/11/2014", "title": "Tong\\u2019s Value Investing Portfolio: Added Crescendo and Willowglen", "article": " I STARTED this portfolio last week buying OceanCash Pacific Bhd. The primary objective of this portfolio is to find companies listed on Bursa Malaysia that operate with sustainable business models, improving productivity, offer unique products or services, have innovative ideas or disruptive technologies, trading on low stock valuations, with good growth prospects and have strong balance sheets. Obviously it is a challenging task but I believe there are still a number of companies with many, even if not all, of the above characteristics. And I believe these companies that meet many of the above criteria will do well in the longer term, even as the overall stock market valuations consolidate. As stated last week, I believe the overall stock market is overvalued, especially when viewed against a backdrop of rising internal and external economic challenges,\\u00a0 and a more worrisome political, racial and religious outlook. Even at the micro levels, the outlook for productivity and private investments is not positive. This week, I bought two other Bursa listed companies that meet my criteria. On Oct 13, I bought 6,000 shares of Crescendo Corporation Bhd at RM2.84 per share, following this stock being picked by Insider Asia in www.theedgemarkets.com and The Edge Financial Daily (FD) in the morning. Crescendo is a Johor developer with a landbank of 2,921 acres,\\u00a0 of which 54.8% is within the Iskandar Malaysia (IM) region. More critically, 65.7% of its gross development value is industrial properties. This remains a high growth area into the future, catering to both the needs of Singapore SMEs and the growing economic activities of IM itself. Singaporeans bought 56% of the Nusa Cemerlang Industrial Park development by Crescendo. Its other developments are mostly the bread and butter type of mixed landed residential and commercial. Unbilled sales stand at RM128 million with RM800 million worth of launches for the next two years, for a company with a market capitalisation of RM637 million. The stock is trading at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of only 4.3 times and a yield of 5.8%. Net gearing is 9.2%. Price to book is 0.8 times. Based on Edge Research revaluation, it is trading at about 60% discount to asset value, as most of its landbank was acquired between 1996 and 2006. Two of its largest tracts of land are in Bandar Cemerlang (1,390 acres) and Kota Tinggi (794.4 acres), carried at RM3.08 psf and RM1.12 psf respectively. Given its low P/E valuations, low gearing, high dividend yield, large discounts to asset value and good growth prospects while operating in a sector of minimum risks, Edge Research (see www.theedgemarkets.com) assigns Crescendo a fundamental score of 2.3 out of 3.0 and a valuation score of 3.0 out of 3.0. It has a rising ROE of above 20% for a company with very small net debt. Beat that. On Oct 14, I added 10,000 shares of Willowglen MSC Bhd at 73 sen each to my portfolio. Again, this was done after the stock was highlighted at Insider Asia in www.theedgemarkets.com and FD. This is a technology company, highly scalable with a proven track record. It provides systems and solutions for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA),\\u00a0 a computerised system for gathering and analysing real time data. Its clients include the Housing Development Board of Singapore, Singapore Power, Public Utilities Board of Singapore, Prasarana Malaysia and Petronas Gas. 82.6% of its revenue is from Singapore, with the rest from Malaysia. The company is expanding not just in the two countries but also in Indonesia. Its revenue and pre-tax profit have grown consistently the past three years, increasing at 23% and 27% annually respectively. The company carries inventory of less than RM1.5 million, which is less than 1.5% of sales consistently. ROE has improved from 15% to a whopping 25%. Willowglen is cash rich with RM53.6 million, representing 30.3% of its current stock price. At its current market capitalisation of RM174.03 million, its dividend yield is 4.1% and its trailing 12-month P/E is 8.8 times. Edge Research gives Willowglen a fundamental score of 3.0 out of 3.0 and a valuation score of 2.4 out of 3.0. Willowglen is a technology company with a proven track record that has excellent prospects to grow regionally. Given its cost structure, ROE will continue to rise faster than sales growth. A company growing at over 20% annually, cash rich, ROE of 25% and trading at 8.8 times net P/E? I think this is value investing. A summary of my portfolio is attached with the stocks I bought, when I bought and at what price. Given the overall depressing stock market over the last week, this portfolio of three stocks, only bought a few days ago, is performing reasonably well.

Its total order book now stands at RM900.8 million, out of which RM800 million comes from its upstream business and RM100.8 million from the manpower supply business. \\u201cWe intend to replenish our order book through various tenders that we have submitted so far which will boost our earnings in the long run,\\u201d Mokhtar told reporters after the company\\u2019s debut on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia yesterday.

Carimin, the 11th company listed on Bursa this year, closed 4.5% or 5 sen higher at RM1.15, with 42.98 million shares done. Its market capitalisation stood at RM269 million. Since its establishment in 1989, Mokhtar said Carimin has performed various upstream works worth RM1.33 billion for its major client Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd. This amount includes a five-year hook-up and commissioning contract worth RM899 million that it bagged in November last year, he said. The group had also completed a total of RM265 million worth of projects for other O&G majors such as Petrofac Malaysia PM304 Ltd, Newfield Pensinsular Malaysia Inc and Murphy Sarawak Oil Co Ltd.

Mokhtar added that the listing exercise will increase the group\\u2019s cash and cash equivalents to RM23.32 million from RM15.37 million currently, and thus reducing Carimin\\u2019s tendency to seek external funding. As for the proceeds of RM66.8 million raised from its initial public offering, Carimin plans to utilise 52.9% or RM35.32 million to purchase an offshore support vessel; 18% or RM12 million will be used to develop its yard in Terengganu, 12% or RM8 million to pay bank borrowings, 11.9% or RM7.95 million for working capital and 5.2% or RM3.5 million to pay for its listing expenses. As at June 30, 2014, Carimin had total borrowings of RM41.9 million, translating into a gearing ratio of 0.39 times. Mokhtar said the repayment of bank borrowings from part of the listing proceeds will optimise its financial position and reduce its interest cost by between RM240,000 and RM400,000 annually, based on effective interest rate of between 3% and 5% respectively. \\u00a0 This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on November 11, 2014."}, "708": {"date_posted": "10/11/2014", "title": "MISC shares rise on improved 3Q14 results", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 10): MISC Bhd saw its share price rose to a high of RM7.53 this morning after investors are excited by the company\\u2019s third quarter financial results for financial year 2014 released last Friday.

Only a year ago, the sector was much sought after by fund managers and the stocks were a \\u201cscreaming buy\\u201d on Bursa Malaysia. So, what has gone wrong in the industry? Falling crude oil prices are seen as the cause of the selling pressure, but analysts opine this is only an \\u201cexcuse\\u201d for investors to take profit in O&G stocks, most of which had surged to multi-year highs, if not new peaks. \\u201cThe continued drop in crude oil has surely dampened sentiments. But there is unlikely to be any major hit on the local O&G companies\\u2019 earnings as most of them have already secured contracts that could last them two years,\\u201d says an\\u00a0 insurance fund manager. He believes disappointing earnings are the main cause of the selling, partly because some of the major contracts awarded by Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) have not been reactivated. \\u201cEarnings delivery wasn\\u2019t there \\u2026\\u00a0 so far the figures are either in line with or below expectations. None has announced a pleasant surprise,\\u201d says the fund manager, noting that there would be bargain-hunting opportunities should share prices slide further. \\u201cCorporate earnings will pick up next year. However, visibility will get blur beyond the two-year horizon when the existing contracts end,\\u201d he adds. Analysts believe the upstream players in the O&G industry have more to worry about than the downstream players. The upstream segment is expected to see a slowdown in contract flows while the downstream segment will continue to be driven by jobs in the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) project. Kenanga Research\\u2019s Teh Kian Yeong, who has a \\u201cneutral\\u201d rating on the sector, says the upstream segment has been sluggish, adding that foreign awards fuelled the bulk of the RM5.6 billion worth of contracts in the third quarter this year. \\u201cSome of the anticipated upstream contracts, such as fabrication, offshore support vessels and inspection, repair and maintenance (IRM), may only emerge at the very end of 2014 and run the risk of spilling over into 2015.\\u201d Nevertheless, Teh says it is not all gloom and doom for the O&G industry. He is of the view that the downstream segment will continue to shine, thanks to the rollout of jobs. \\u201cOnly about RM27 billion worth of contracts out of an estimated RM51 billion have been dished out thus far. More is expected from the downstream segment in the medium term,\\u201d he says, adding that some of the awards have already been priced into the stock prices. Industry analysts advise investors to stay away from stocks that have not locked in long-term contracts. RHB Research\\u2019s Kong Ho Meng has downgraded four stocks so far \\u2014 Perisai Petroleum Teknologi Bhd, Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd, Daya Materials Bhd and Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd. He says the common themes of these four downgrades were a slow order book replenishment rate, underutilised assets and operational uncertainties, resulting in low margins. Kong has also turned cautious on the O&G sector as he believes the current valuations are unsustainable. \\u201cWe believe that as players expand abroad, the big gap in valuations (compared to their regional and global peers) should narrow and Malaysian O&G stocks should shed their premiums.\\u201d Currently, Malaysian O&G stocks are valued higher than their regional and global peers, albeit on a lower earnings base and market share, says Kong. Amid investors\\u2019 cautious approach, analysts expect the focus to primarily be on subcontractors and suppliers, such as KNM Group Bhd and Pantech Group Holdings Bhd. Other counters that are favoured include Wah Seong Corp Bhd, Dialog Group Bhd, Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd and Alam Maritim Resources Bhd. Among the O&G stocks that have been\\u00a0falling since August are Yinson Holdings Bhd (-22.3% to RM2.70), Coastal Contracts Bhd (-21.2% to RM4.20), Bumi Armada Bhd (-20% to RM1.64),\\u00a0 UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd (-19.2% to RM3.30) and SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd (-16.5% to RM3.68). Besides falling crude oil prices and less-than-impressive earnings, some analysts and fund managers are also concerned about Petronas cutting its capital expenditure (capex). They observe that the negative sentiment began when Petronas president and CEO Tan Sri Shamsul Azhar Abbas guided that the national oil company could reduce its 2015 capex. He also cautioned upstream O&G players against going on a buying spree, as there are insufficient contracts to go around. This statement was a cautionary message to the industry, especially upstream players. A fund manager tells The Edge that there are uncertainties on the horizon, because of speculation about a possible change of the guard at the national oil company. Should that happen, it would mean changes to Petronas\\u2019 capex policy and so on. \\u201cWill the new chieftain spend as much or less? Will he want to continue efforts on reviving mature fields, meaning EOR (enhanced oil recovery)?\\u201d asks the fund manager. This year, Petronas has spent the bulk of its capex on its floating liquefied natural gas facility and the implementation of chemical enhanced oil recovery (CEOR) projects. Crude oil prices slid below the US$90 per barrel level last week amidst concerns about oversupply as demand is expected to grow at a slower pace. The persistent decline surprised many as the geopolitical tension in the Middle East and Russia was expected to drive the prices up. The benchmark Brent crude fell to US$89.05 per barrel last Friday, a level not seen since November 2010, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) dropped to US$84.62 per barrel. Crude oil prices have tumbled by almost a third from their peak of US$115 per barrel in June, at which point they had remained above US$100 for a year. Analysts attribute this to muted demand and ample supply. \\u201cIn recent weeks, the market has remained focused on the supply and demand fundamentals, which look overwhelmingly bearish,\\u201d Vandana Hari, editorial director at Platts McGraw Hill Financial Asia, tells The Edge. \\u201cThese factors, especially on the demand side, are not going to change anytime soon. In my view, there is a lot of uncertainty in the oil market, especially when it comes to geopolitical problems.\\u201d She reckons that crude will only rise above US$100 per barrel after its recent fall if there is a major disruption in supply. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) has been pumping more than 30 million barrels per day, which is a collective target agreed to by each of its members. But now that crude has dropped below the benchmark of US$90 per barrel, many expect Opec to intervene to stabilise prices. According to the organisation\\u2019s oil market report for September, world demand this year is expected to reach 1.05 million barrels per day (mbpd) and supply 1.68 mbpd. For 2015, Opec forecasts a demand of 1.19 mbpd and higher supply of 1.24 mbpd. Moving forward, Credit Suisse believes Brent crude will remain in a new range of US$97 per barrel in 2015 while WTI will average US$89 per barrel. It predicts that prices will grind down to US$86 and US$80 per barrel respectively in 2016 and 2017. \\u2014 By Madiha Fuad and Fatin Rasyiqah Mustaza This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on October 13 - 19, 2014."}, "712": {"date_posted": "6/11/2014", "title": "MISC to gain if Petronas changes LNG strategy", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: MISC Bhd, a 62.7%-owned subsidiary of Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas), will have much to gain if the national oil company abandons its strategy to directly own its fleet of liquefied natural gas (LNG) vessels. In a report yesterday, CIMB Research is of the view that Petronas may sell four LNG new builds it ordered in 2013 as it relegates ship ownership to \\u201clow priority\\u201d. Gan Jian Bo, an analyst with CIMB Research, said Petronas may be changing its ship ownership strategy to directly order LNG vessels, revealed in August 2013, because its hands are full with LNG projects in Malaysia and overseas which offer \\u201ca lot better\\u201d internal rate of return (IRR). \\u201cPetronas is very busy with several projects. They have the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (Rapid) project in Malaysia, the Gladstone LNG project in Australia and one in Canada with Progress Energy,\\u201d Gan told The Edge Financial Daily. Gan estimates that LNG projects would typically offer IRR of 12% to 15%, compared with the high single-digit returns from the shipping business. \\u201cIf Petronas does sell these vessels to MISC, Petronas will likely charter these ships from MISC to meet its shipping requirements in Bintulu and other ongoing projects like FLNG1,\\u201d said CIMB Research. \\u201cThe inclusion of four new long-term LNG charter contracts with Petronas will help mitigate MISC\\u2019s LNG earnings decline, since six of its LNG ship charters expire in 2014 to 2017,\\u201d it said. This is timely as Petronas\\u2019 four new vessels are slated for delivery in 2016 and 2017 and will be earnings accretive from 2017. The new ships also come with the option to procure four additional LNG vessels, which could be passed on to MISC. With that view, CIMB Research made an \\u201cadd\\u201d call on MISC\\u2019s stock at RM6.90 and gave it a target price of RM8.22. MIDF Research said Petronas\\u2019 change of strategy is \\u201clogical\\u201d as it does not have the expertise to manage LNG vessels. \\u201cPetronas ordered the four LNG new builds after its attempt to privatise MISC failed to ensure that there will be no interruption in the LNG transportation services,\\u201d an analyst from MIDF Research told The Edge Financial Daily. \\u201cPetronas does not have the expertise to manage these assets and had to engage MISC to manage the construction of the new ships. Selling the ships to MISC would make sense,\\u201d he said. He added that the shipping expert would also have the financial muscle to acquire the four vessels from Petronas, having strengthened its balance sheet after the sale of its 50% stake in Gumusut-Kasap Semi Floating Production System (L) Ltd to Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd in 2013. To recap, Petronas had in August last year announced that it had decided to buy its own LNG vessels, after it failed to privatise MISC. Two months later, the group awarded the contract to build four LNG vessels, with the option to order an additional four LNG vessels, to South Korea\\u2019s Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. At the same time, MISC was engaged to provide project management and technical consultancy services for the construction of the new LNG ships. \\u00a0 This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on November 6, 2014."}, "713": {"date_posted": "5/11/2014", "title": "Back to the drawing board on Oxley\\u2019s KLCC land", "article": " SINGAPORE-BASED Oxley Holdings Ltd\\u2019s (Oxley) Malaysian unit Oxley Rising Sdn Bhd will have to resubmit plans for the proposed development of a prime piece of land it is acquiring in Jalan Ampang, Kuala Lumpur, after two of its applications to the local council were rejected. Oxley Rising had initially planned to build two 83-storey skyscrapers comprising offices, serviced suites, hotel and retail space on the parcel just 500m from the Petronas Twin Towers. The freehold land currently houses six bungalows, including Nasi Kandar Pelita and Chef Choi restaurant. The proposal for the twin high-rises, submitted to the Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur (DBKL) in May 2014, was rejected in July. YTS Architecture Sdn Bhd, on behalf of its client Oxley Rising, then handed a fresh application to DBKL for approval. On Aug 5, the new proposal revealed that the height of the buildings had been reduced to 53 and 64 storeys. The plan also offered 765 units of serviced suites, 308 units of hotel rooms and 450 units of offices. The buildings would sit on a 9-storey retail podium cum multi-storey car park. This proposal was rejected on Sept 4, 2014. Both Oxley Malaysia and Oxley Singapore declined to comment when asked about the details on this project and the plot ratio it is hoping to obtain. DBKL\\u2019s KL City Plan 2020 guide states that the allowable plot ratio for this particular parcel, which Oxley is in the process of acquiring, is eight. However, based on the high plot ratio obtained by Magna Prima Bhd for a project which is less than 1km away, Oxley is probably hopeful of obtaining a plot ratio of at least 12. Magna Prima is redeveloping the former site of Lai Meng primary school. Oxley announced in November last year that its subsidiary, Oxley Rising, had entered into a deal to buy a 135,356 sq ft land parcel in Jalan Ampang for RM446.67 million, or a record price of RM3,300 psf, from the executors of the estate of Leong Mai Leng. Based on Oxley\\u2019s announcement to the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX), the purchase price was arrived at on a willing buyer-willing seller basis after taking into account current market prices of the surrounding area and its assessment of the land\\u2019s development potential. It added that no formal valuation of the land had been conducted. A total of RM44.67 million was paid as deposit, and the balance is to be paid on the completion of the acquisition, which is scheduled to take place on or before Nov 4, 2014. Oxley did not reply to The Edge\\u2019s query if the deal will be completed as planned. A land search conducted at the Kuala Lumpur Federal Territory Department of Lands and Mines reveals that as at Sept 19, the parcel had yet to be transferred to Oxley Rising. It had registered a caveat on the parcel on Nov 21, 2013. The search documents show that this particular lot measures 13,860.03 sq m. However, the announcement to SGX states that the area of the land being purchased is 12,575 sq m. It is not known why there is a difference in size. One possibility is that the size of the lot to be divested is smaller than its original size. Oxley has been expanding rapidly in Malaysia through land acquisition and joint ventures, though its ventures do not appear to be smooth sailing. It has aborted two ventures so far. In July this year, Oxley announced that its unit, Oxley Malaysia Pte Ltd, had terminated its proposed acquisition of TCK Capital Sdn Bhd for RM77.85 million. Oxley Malaysia wanted to take over TCK Capital mainly because the Ministry of Finance had agreed to sell a leasehold parcel in Jalan Hang Tuah, Kuala Lumpur, to TCK Capital in Nov 2011. The plot, measuring 4.73 acres, was supposed to have been sold for RM190 million. The ministry subsequently decided to cancel the sale, resulting in Oxley Malaysia aborting the purchase. In January this year, Oxley\\u2019s subsidiary, Oxley Treasure Sdn Bhd, entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Sepang Goldcoast Sdn Bhd and its subsidiary, Sepang Bay Sdn Bhd. Sepang Goldcoast and Sepang Bay hold interests in two parcels of leasehold land measuring 116.88 acres in Sepang, Selangor. Under the MoU, Oxley Treasure would be engaged to develop a mixed development in phases and get 85% of the gross development value (GDV) of the land. The MoU was mutually terminated on June 24, 2014. Even so, Oxley appears to have plans for projects with at least RM10 billion in GDV in Malaysia. In an Aug 22 presentation, Oxley said its total land parcels in Malaysia amounted to a total of 239,274 sq m, including some parcels that are being developed on a joint-venture basis. One of Oxley\\u2019s projects is the development of a parcel in Section 16, Petaling Jaya, located next to Phileo Damansara. Oxley\\u2019s subsidiary, Oxley Diamond Co Ltd, acquired the freehold land measuring 20,234 sq m for RM104.54 million in June last year from Rising Star City Sdn Bhd. Oxley plans to build three blocks comprising serviced apartments, hotel, SoHos, serviced suites and retail space.

Now, however, it seems that the tide may turn, and downstream oil and gas players are likely to benefit from Petronas\\u2019 RM86 billion Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) project, comprising the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) complex. Likely beneficiaries of PIC include KNM Group Bhd, Pantech Group Holdings Bhd, Wah Seong Corp Bhd and Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd. They will mainly be required to manufacture and supply equipment, and possibly fabricate structures in PIC. Most of these counters\\u2019 share prices have more than doubled in the past year, buoyed by the possibilities in Pengerang. KNM\\u2019s share price has gained some 175%, hitting a one-year high of RM1.10 on Aug 4, from a low of 40 sen in October last year. The stock closed at 81.5 sen last Friday, which translates into a market capitalisation of RM1.33 billion. Pantech\\u2019s shares hit an all-time high of RM1.11 on July 18, gaining 30.29% from 85.8 sen at end-March this year. The company ended trading at RM1.06 last Friday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM633.2 million. Muhibbah\\u2019s and Wah Seong\\u2019s share prices have more than doubled over the past year, closing at RM2.86 and RM1.68 last Friday, with market capitalisations pegged at RM1.22 billion and RM1.3 billion respectively. An analyst from Kenanga Research says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s the process equipment guys and manufacturers that will have more play in PIC.\\u201d She notes that the main engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC) contracts have already been awarded. \\u201c[So] right now, it\\u2019s for them [the winners of the EPCC contracts] to give out the jobs to the local guys as sub-contractors.\\u201d Out of the 13 contracts that Petronas has awarded for PIC, five are EPCC contracts for the refinery and steam cracker component. They were awarded in August to five international outfits from Taiwan, China, Spain, the UK and Japan, which in turn have joint-venture agreements with local players. \\u201cMost local players are in the final stage of negotiation to undertake portions of the multi-billion ringgit EPCC packages as sub-contractors, and will likely conclude the talks either at the end of this year or early 2015,\\u201d says an industry executive. Meanwhile, Pantech executive director Adrian Tan says the group is working closely with the EPCC contractors to meet their need for pipes, valves and fittings (PVFs). He adds that once PIC is completed, Pantech will look forward to supplying maintenance services to the complex. \\u201cHealth and safety are key \\u2026 oil and gas companies\\u2019 requirements are very strict and the constant monitoring of the PVF for corrosion is mandatory,\\u201d he says. Tan opines that Petronas has been looking to create more value in the downstream segment. \\u201cAfter the completion of PIC, I believe the business in the downstream segment will continue to flourish.\\u201d Aaron Tan of MIDF Research says local fabricators alone do not have the capacity to construct PIC. In fact, a local fabricator recently noted that even if all the yards in Malaysia were 100% dedicated to PIC, there would still be insufficient capacity. \\u201cWork has to be done overseas and there will be a spillover effect,\\u201d he says. Located on a 6,242-acre site in Johor, PIC comprises the RAPID complex and its associated facilities, including the Pengerang co-generation plant, a regasification terminal and an air separation unit. The multi-billion-ringgit project also includes a raw water supply project, crude and product tanks as well as central and shared utilities and facilities. \\u201cHowever, before taking into account capacity, focus should first be on the individual company\\u2019s capability, financial strength and human expertise,\\u201d says MIDF\\u2019s Tan. Meanwhile, the industry executive explains that foreign companies are the likely candidates for EPCC contracts because local players usually do not have the strong balance sheets needed to execute EPCC services. \\u201cBut it is not cost effective for these foreigners to bring in workers from overseas. It would be more cost efficient for them to hire local companies for execution instead,\\u201d the industry executive says, adding that a fairly large amount of PIC jobs would involve civil construction. The industry executive notes that even though the major contracts that are worth more have been awarded to foreigners, \\u201clocal downstream players will find that a less than RM1 billion contract is sufficient to allow them to move forward and generate profits\\u201d. Even though there appears to be a slowdown in the upstream segment, MIDF\\u2019s Tan does not think that the increase in PIC jobs will outstrip the demand for offshore fabrication services. \\u201cAt this point in time, we are not really bullish about offshore fabrication projects. There will still be jobs available, such as the Kasawari central processing platform that is worth US$1 billion (RM3.26 billion), but the potential winners are just a minute few.\\u201d The analyst from Kenanga has a negative view on the oil and gas offshore fabrication segment, but is bullish on Pengerang. \\u201cOn the Pengerang side, it will be vibrant,\\u201d she says. With offshore fabrication jobs hard to come by since late last year, she believes that there will still be jobs coming in but they will be in the fabrication space. Other beneficiaries of PIC, apart from onshore fabricators, are construction companies such as WCT Holdings Bhd, Zelan Bhd and Gadang Holdings Bhd. WCT had in July won a RM341.88 million contract for the construction of roads in RAPID while Gadang won a RM350 million package for the provision of preparation works for Phase 2 of RAPID. Meanwhile, Zelan secured a RM248.5 million contract to construct a jetty on the site.

The REIT is part of Tan Sri Quek Leng Chan\\u2019s stable of Hong Leong Group companies. Revenue dropped 24% to RM10.1 million, from RM13.3million previously, which the REIT blamed on lower occupancy rates in Menara ING and Menara HLA, and hikes on assessments and electricity tarff.

The cement maker saw its net profit fall 7.1% to RM21.47 million in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2014, down from RM23.12 million a year ago, mainly due to thinner profit margins from the cement segment arising from intense price competition. It said the lower sales volume from the concrete segment, lower share of profit from the group\\u2019s associated company, as well as drop on interest income, had also affected its net profit. The group\\u2019s quarterly revenue grew 3.3% to RM148.68 million, up from RM143.93 million a year ago, amidst stronger demand for cement in the domestic market. Century Logistics Holdings Bhd\\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, Century Total Logistics Sdn Bhd, has entered into sale and purchase agreements yesterday, to acquire two adjoining parcels of vacant industrial land, totalling 358,108 square feet in Klang, for a combined RM38.68 million. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, Century Logistics said the proposed acquisitions \\u2014 which will be funded by internal funds and bank borrowings \\u2014 are to facilitate the expansion of its distribution centres in the Klang Valley. The group also said it is formulating plans to construct warehouses and office buildings, with construction cost estimated at RM40-50 million.

Revenue for the period under review slipped a marginal 2.2% year-on-year to RM8.23 billion, from RM8.41 billion, mainly due to a decrease in sales volume by 4%, despite an increase in average selling price by 2%. The group said that its operating profit for 3QFY14 was at RM230.7 million, down 26.8% on year from RM315.3 million, mainly as a result of lower gross margin by RM100.9 million, which is primarily a result of higher product cost due to unfavourable timing differences of the prices on the Mean of Platts Singapore, which is a measure of fuel oil pricing in Singapore, compared to the previous corresponding quarter. YFG Bhd\\u2019s audited financial statements for the financial year ended June 30, 2014 (FY14) will be revised, due to the adjustment on the quantum of impairment made on a project, which is temporarily suspended.

However, that is set to change as the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) project gains traction. RAPID is a part of the 20,000-acre Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex (PIPC), which is poised to be a regional downstream oil and gas hub. The complex will have a capacity of 300,000 barrels per day and is expected to be commissioned by early 2019. Work is already underway at RAPID. Up to 70,000 people will be involved in its construction and when it is operational, it will employ more than 4,000 people. \\u201cThings are moving very fast. Petronas has awarded many packages in engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning. In the meantime, we have received a lot of enquiries from Petronas and other parties involved in the entire project on providing accommodation and housing,\\u201d says Soam. IJM Land has embarked on a massive upgrading of the area, which is estimated to cost RM30 million to RM40 million. \\u201cPreviously, there was only a two-lane road going into the site. We are now increasing it to a four-lane one,\\u201d Soam says. \\u201cWe are also building a new entryway with a new arch. We are also tearing down the golf club building and rebuilding it, since it is a simple structure. All the hotel rooms are already upgraded, so now we are working on the clubhouse and restaurants.\\u201d The group is also upgrading the 30 units of townhouses built by Arab Malaysian Finance that have remained unsold. \\u201cThese are for executive-level staff [of PIPC] like supervisors and engineers. We are now refurbishing the units to rent them out, with the intention of selling them eventually. There has been a lot of enquiries on accommodation, so we know there is pent-up demand. They are really fussy about accommodation, so we have to do up the units nicely,\\u201d says Soam. Launch of Phase 1 IJM Land is planning to launch the first phase of its township, Fairway Golf Villas, before year-end. It will comprise 59 villas with land areas of 5,488 sq ft to 13,765 sq ft and built-ups of 2,997 sq ft to 4,415 sq ft. Prices are pegged from RM1.4 million to RM2.2 million. The villas come with green features such as large windows, rainwater harvesting systems, roof insulation and green tinted glass to reduce heat, porous openings for cross ventilation and sun-shading louvres to minimise glare. In addition, the homes will also have long balconies that provide views of the golf course and porches that accommodate up to three cars. Some of the villas will also have a pavilion and larger outdoor space. It will be a gated and guarded precinct with round-the-clock patrols. There will also be an alarm system and perimeter fencing for each villa. The dining rooms and master bedrooms will be installed with panic buttons that are linked to the guardhouse. Private previews will be held on Oct 16 and 17 here, while an exclusive preview will be held in Singapore on Oct 18 and 19, says Soam. Future phases of the development will offer cluster homes, semi-detached houses, zero-lot bungalows, bungalows, townhouses, and shopoffices. Also available will be commercial and retail elements. Sebana Cove Resort will also take advantage of the Shanti forest reserve and river banks of the Shanti and Sebina rivers to provide a more natural setting for its homes. The properties on the river banks and fronting the sea will no doubt fetch a premium. Meanwhile, the rest of the land has been earmarked for mass housing. The township is expected to be mostly low in density, with about five homes per acre. The entire township is expected to take 10 to 15 years to develop. Strategic move As the market takes a breather \\u2014 no thanks to cooling measures in both sides of the Causeway, the tit-for-tat raising of toll rates by Malaysia and Singapore, the oversupply of properties in Johor and falling property prices in Singapore \\u2014 what prompted IJM Land to launch this year? \\u201cI was at a property talk recently and one of the speakers advised us to \\u2018sit tight for the next two years\\u2019. How can we do that? Even unlisted property players must continue to sell because they have holding costs,\\u201d Soam says with amusement. He also shrugs off concerns over Singapore\\u2019s cooling property market and its potential ripple effects in Johor, arguing that prices are still competitive in the state. \\u201cEven after the drop in HDB flat prices, it is still S$1,000 psf [in Singapore]. We are still a lot cheaper if you compare landed homes with apartments, and we are not in Medini or other flagships [that have been] affected by the glut,\\u201d he points out. It should be noted that Sebana Cove Resort is not IJM Land\\u2019s first venture in Johor. The group has had piecemeal launches in the southern state, such as its gated and guarded landed residential Nusa Duta scheme in Skudai, Suria Mas Suites in Larkin and Epic apartments in Tampoi. IJM Land had also tied up with JKG (Johor) Sdn Bhd to develop a mixed-use development near Johor Baru. However, Sebana Cove Resort will be IJM Land\\u2019s boldest venture in Johor as the group continues to adopt a conservative stance in the southern state. Still, Soam believes that landed homes are a safer option in the state, as they are more sought-after, especially by owner-occupiers. According to Soam, IJM Land had initially wanted to market the project as a lifestyle-living option for retirees in Singapore. However, there were no takers because the bungalows were far from other attractions, as the Senai-Desaru highway had not been built yet. Some may feel that the township is a good distance from Johor Baru, the Causeway and the Second Link. However, Soam notes that the township is very close to the Tanjung Belungkor and Tanjung Pengelih ferry terminals. It is a 30-minute boat ride to the Changi Point ferry terminal, followed by a 10-minute journey to Changi Airport. \\u201cThe Tanjung Belungkor ferry terminal has facilities for cars. In fact, Star Cruise luxury liners used to dock here and bring cars,\\u201d he says. \\u201cWhen Tan Sri Kong Cho Ha was minister of transport, his ministry had promised that there would be car ferries this year, but that did not happen.

We expect the car ferry service from Tanjung Belungkor to Changi Point to start in early 2016.\\u201d Johor Baru is an hour\\u2019s drive away via the Senai-Desaru and Coastal Highways. This is almost half the time it used to take via the coastal and trunk roads, Soam adds. \\u201cAs we also have water taxis as alternative transport to Singapore, we will not be affected by the toll hikes and imposition of vehicle entry permits [in Malaysia],\\u201d he says.

JKG Land\\u2019s shareholders are low-profile tycoon Tan Sri Robert Tan Hua Choon, Puan Sri Ong Poo Choi, Tan Hua Chan and Tan Ching. The development will comprise serviced apartments, bungalows, a mall and offices. The Centara Residences serviced apartments will be launched this month. The two 25-storey towers will house 428 units with built-ups of 800 sq ft to 1,000 sq ft. Prices range from RM400,000 to RM500,000, or RM500 psf. The development will come with an infinity pool, wading pool, reflexology pool, barbecue area, children\\u2019s playground, landscaped terrace, garden, gymnasium, sauna, changing rooms and water feature. According to Soam, Nasa Land plans to launch the serviced apartments after the tabling of Budget 2015.

Given its expanding order book, some strategic investors, including Felda Investment Corp (FIC), are keen to acquire a substantial stake in Barakah, which made its debut on Bursa Malaysia last year through a reverse takeover. According to sources, Barakah is conducting studies on local marginal oilfields to form a cluster for development. \\u201cIt is part of the group\\u2019s plan to strengthen its presence in the exploration and production segment,\\u201d says an industry executive, who also notes that Barakah, which prefers proven oilfields, has yet to narrow them down. Barakah\\u2019s officials were not contactable at press time to shed light on the matter. \\u201cThe company has to look at the strength of its balance sheet and risk profile of the assets first before finalising any investment,\\u201d says the industry executive. Should its venture into marginal oilfield development materialise, Barakah will need fresh capital. It is learnt that several interested parties have approached the company for a substantial stake. So far, FIC has entered into talks with the company. Established as an investment arm of the Federal Land Development Authority, FIC undertakes business activities that are not plantation-related. If it successfully acquires equity interest in Barakah, it would be FIC\\u2019s first investment in the oil and gas industry. \\u201cBut there is no concrete decision as yet on bringing in a strategic investor mainly because the controlling shareholders believe the market price is undervalued,\\u201d says a source familiar with the company. Barakah\\u2019s shares have been on a downward trend lately, declining nearly 27% from a peak of RM1.87 in February to RM1.37 last Thursday. Net profit in its second quarter ended June 30 tripled to RM12.34 million from the previous corresponding period while revenue surged to RM159.7 million from RM57.71 million. Cash reserves stood at RM145.58 million as at June 30 while short-term borrowings amounted to RM30.46 million. The steep rise in earnings was mainly due to the completion of a topside installation job for Kebabangan Petroleum Operating Co (KPOC) in Sabah, the start of its Pan-Malaysia transport and installation contract and other construction activities carried out during the quarter. KPOC is a joint-venture company created for the development and production-sharing contract for the Kebabangan gas field off Sabah by Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd (40%), ConocoPhillips Sabah Gas Ltd (30%) and Shell Energy Asia Ltd (30%). Kenanga Research expects Barakah\\u2019s profit recognition to pick up in the second half of the year on the back of higher installation and construction activity and the execution of the T&I contract. Last year, Barakah was awarded a contract worth an estimated RM1.5 billion by various oil and gas production-sharing companies for the transport and installation of facilities in Malaysia\\u2019s offshore fields. The contract is for three years with an extension option for another year for facilities under Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u2019s Pan-Malaysia project. It is worth noting that in the last 10 months alone, Barakah managed to secure four jobs \\u2014 the RM260 million procurement, construction and commissioning of pipelines job for the Pengerang Integrated Complex by Petronas Gas Bhd; the hook-up, commissioning and topside major maintenance job for Lundin Malaysia B.V.; the RM29 million engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning job for Petronas Dagangan Bhd\\u2019s biodiesel storage and blending facilities in Miri; and a pre-commissioning services job for a pipeline in Terengganu from GOM Resources Sdn Bhd. According to Kenanga Research, the first work order from Lundin is worth RM30 million and is for six months. The earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation margin for the contract could be between 20% and 22%. The contract period is from Aug 14, 2014, to Feb 4, 2016. \\u201cExcluding the tender book for the Arab Saudi project, we understand that Barakah is actively bidding for RM400 million to RM600 million worth of projects,\\u201d says the research house, adding that Barakah\\u2019s order book of RM2.3 billion provides earnings visibility for the next three years. Most analysts who track the stock have pegged to it a fair value that is at least 20% higher than its closing price of RM1.37 last Thursday. The target prices range from RM1.73 to RM1.95. UOB Kay Hian has the highest target price among five research houses. Its valuations are pegged at 14 times fully diluted earnings with its forecast earnings per share at 13.3 sen for FY2015 ending Dec 31. \\u201cOur target price-to-earnings ratio is conservative as it is at a 15% discount to the sector\\u2019s 16.5 times.

REDtone\\u2019s board are of the opinion that the amounts are recoverable and accordingly, no impairment has been made in the financial statements.\nWhile management strongly believes the amounts are recoverable despite being long outstanding, the news could have some negative consequences for the share price in the near term.\nWe understand that the group had earlier targeted to apply for a transfer to the Main Board following the release of its FY14 audited account. Nevertheless, in view of the above qualified opinion made by the external auditor, we expect some hiccups in the process. We believe REDtone\\u2019s businesses are not expected to see any material impact should the group fail to transfer its listing status. Sime Darby Bhd\nFair value: RM11.20 BUY AMINVESTMENT RESEARCH (Oct 1): Sime Darby has aborted its plan to acquire a 49% stake in New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL) from Kulim (M) Bhd after holding exclusive talks with the latter. We believe the stumbling blocks could be the pricing and questions over Sime Darby\\u2019s ability to exert control over NBPOL, which is now largely independently managed apart from Kulim. We are neutral on this latest development.\nAt the current price of \\u00a34.175 per share, NBPOL is trading at a PER of 16 times the consensus FY14F EPS of \\u00a30.26 per share. At a premium of 30% to 50% over the current price (\\u00a35.40 to \\u00a36.30 per share), NBPOL would be valued at 21 times and 24 times its FY14F EPS \\u2014 which is on the steep side. This would have translated into a purchase price of RM4.3 billion to RM5 billion for Sime Darby to assume full control of NBPOL. Nonetheless, we believe the long-term prospects remain intact, and the stock will benefit from any upticks in the crude palm oil price. Petra Energy Bhd\nTarget price: RM3.02 NEUTRAL RHB RESEARCH (Oct 1): Recall that Petra Energy had been awarded a five-year RM2.5 billion hook-up, construction and commissioning (HuCC) and topside major maintenance (TMM) contract from Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd, from May 2013 to May 2018. The HuCC part of the contract has seen activities slowly ramping up while the TMM portion has now been activated \\u2014 earlier than the expected February 2016 start date. We estimate that 11% of the total value of the complete contract will be registered in FY14. As the TMM portion of the contract is on a \\u201ccall-out\\u201d basis, and given the slow ramping up of activities in the HuCC part, we believe our backloaded earnings for the contract is justified.\nPetra Energy was awarded a risk service contract by Petronas to operate the Kapal, Banang, and Meranti (KBM) cluster in partnership with Coastal Energy Ltd. We believe with the early start to the TMM portion of the contract and the successful operation of the KBM cluster, Petra Energy has done well to turn itself around. VS Industry Bhd\nTarget price: RM2.92 BUY RHB RESEARCH (Oct 1): VSI\\u2019s FY14 earnings of RM53.6 million exceeded our and consensus estimates. Its exceptional performance was achieved on the back of better earnings from its Malaysian operation and tax incentives for its exported coffee machines.\nAlthough its turnover in Malaysia grew just 5.7% y-o-y, its PBT surged 78.7% y-o-y on the back of an improved sales mix, particularly contribution from the higher-margin coffee machines.\nA 3.5 sen third interim dividend was declared, which will be followed by a final dividend of 3.5 sen at a later date, bringing the total FY14 gross dividend per share to 11.7 sen. In view of the better-than-expected FY14 earnings, we raise our earnings forecasts for FY15 by 60% on contributions from the sale of existing coffee machine models, contribution from the sale of a new coffee machine model by 4QFY15, and remaining tax incentives of RM15 million that will be utilised in FY15. Gamuda Bhd\nFair value: RM5.40 BUY AMINVESTMENT RESEARCH (Sept 30): Gamuda\\u2019s core FY14 net profit rose 9% y-o-y on higher construction and property earnings. The work progress for KVMRT Line 1 under the MMC-Gamuda joint venture has reached 52% and 35% for the tunnelling and project delivery partner (PDP) components respectively. Core property earnings surged 19% y-o-y on the strong pre-sales trajectory in the last two financial years and stable margins. New property sales fell 55% y-o-y to RM300 million in 4Q, nudging total new sales upwards by 3% to RM1.8 billion.\nGamuda has been reshaping its landbank by acquiring strategic township land during the current lull. More landbanking moves are possible within a year \\u2014 about RM1.3 billion has been set aside in search of more land, including in Penang. Gamuda\\u2019s track record as the PDP for KVMRT1 puts it in good stead to bid for a similar role under the Penang government\\u2019s transport master plan, which could be awarded by mid-2015.

Coastal Contracts Bhd\nTarget price: RM5.94 OUTPERFORM KENANGA RESEARCH (Sept 29): Coastal announced that it has secured the sale of seven offshore support vessels (OSVs) worth a cumulative RM444 million. All these vessels are expected to be delivered in FY14 and FY15. We are positive on this contract as it shows that Coastal is able to secure contract wins in a consistent manner. This current sale award brings its cumulative FY14 vessel sales to RM802 million and shipping order book to RM1.4 billion.\nThis contract comes within our assumed RM1.2 billion shipbuilding order replenishment. The shipbuilding division is currently riding the cyclical upward trend. Although net margins have normalised to between 15% and 25% from FY12 onwards, the shipbuilding industry is still considered lucrative. Coastal\\u2019s maiden jack-up rig is due for delivery by end-2H14. There have been no contracts awarded as yet, but these assets will spearhead the company\\u2019s move into asset-ownership model versus the previous build-and-sell model. The long-term earnings of Coastal\\u2019s jack-up rig compression unit will kick-start in FY15. UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd\nTarget price: RM5.18 ADD CIMB INVESTMENT RESEARCH (Sept 29): The management of UMW-OG took delivery of the US$217 million Naga 6 at a Shenzhen yard recently. The jack-up will be mobilised to Vietnam on Sept 30 to service a 250-day, US$46.5 million contract from PetroVietnam, with PC Vietnam Ltd and Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd as end-clients. Work will begin in mid-October.\nWe are also encouraged by Naga 6\\u2019s daily charter rate of US$150,000 to US$160,000, after deducting mobilisation costs, as it is higher than the current market average of US$140,000 to US$150,000. All of UMW-OG\\u2019s jack-ups are contracted, except Naga 8, the construction of which is expected to be completed in September 2015.\nUMW-OG\\u2019s only other jack-up that is still at the yard is Naga 7, which will start servicing a 120-day, US$20 million contract from Frontier Oil Ltd in the Philippines in January 2015. It aims to venture beyond Southeast Asia in FY15 and targets the Middle East as a potential key market. Genting Malaysia Bhd\nTarget price: RM5.15 BUY MAYBANK INVESTMENT BANK RESEARCH (Sept 29): The poor 2Q14 Ebitda of RM460.4 million was due to low VIP win rates at Resorts World Genting (RWG) and Genting UK (GENUK). We estimate that 2Q14 group Ebitda would have been about RM665 million or 45% higher on normalised VIP win rates at RWG and GENUK. Therefore, we believe investors should not be overly concerned.\nWe are increasingly convinced that GENM will win a prized upstate New York commercial casino licence as it is offering the highest amount of investment into the project, highest amount of licensing fees and/or tax rates and highest number of jobs and salaries. Despite committing to investing more and paying more licensing fees, we estimate that an upstate New York licence will accrete at least a net 47 sen per share.\nWinners will be announced by November at the latest. In the unlikely event that GENM does not win a single licence, our base case SOP-based target price of RM4.70 still offers a 13% upside. Hiap Teck Venture Bhd\nTarget price: 92 sen BUY AFFIN HWANG CAPITAL (Sept 29): Hiap Teck\\u2019s 4Q14 revenue grew 3.7% y-o-y, underpinned by its trading division. Volume from its trading business grew 12.6% y-o-y but was offset by lower average selling prices on stiff competition. Contribution from its manufacturing business fell slightly, also due to price competition.\nDespite the revenue growth, the group\\u2019s pre-tax profit was down 43% y-o-y on the back of pricing pressure. Ebitda margin fell 1.6 percentage points y-o-y to 2%.\nWe expect international prices to remain under pressure on the back of a moderating global economic growth. However, we believe the impact will be partially cushioned as we expect domestic demand for steel products to remain buoyant on the back of existing and upcoming construction and infrastructure projects. Maintain \\u201cbuy\\u201d with an unchanged target price of 92 sen, still based on 12 times CY15 PER. Sasbadi Holdings Bhd\nTarget price: RM2.25 BUY ALLIANCE DBS RESEARCH (Sept 29): Sasbadi\\u2019s proceeds from its initial public offering puts it in a prime position to embark on earnings-accretive mergers and acquisitions in the fragmented educational publishing industry. In addition, there is a huge potential in the untapped educational services market, in particular hands-on learning centres that foster creative thinking and innovation, where Sasbadi could be the missing piece of the puzzle in Malaysia\\u2019s education industry.\nWe forecast Sasbadi\\u2019s FY15 to FY17 core profit after tax will expand at a three-year CAGR of 22%, underpinned by earnings accretive M&As. Valuation is undemanding at 11 times, 9 times and 7 times FY15 to FY17 EPS, while yields are attractive at 5% to 7%.\nWe initiate coverage of Sasbadi with a high-conviction \\u201cbuy\\u201d. Our target price implies 16 times FY15 EPS, and suggests a total return of 55% from the last close of RM1.50. Cypark Resources Bhd\nTarget price: RM3.09 ADD CIMB INVESTMENT RESEARCH (Sept 30): Revenue in 3Q14 increased 24% y-o-y to RM66.6 million, driven by growth in its landscaping, infrastructure and construction division, which almost tripled y-o-y to RM13.1 million during the quarter. Its renewable energy (RE) division continued to post strong growth, expanding 56% y-o-y during the quarter and implying more sales of electricity to the grid.\nCypark\\u2019s Ladang Tanah Merah concession is expected to start soon. The concession period is for 25 years, during which Cypark will open, maintain and close the landfill in Negeri Sembilan. The waste will also act as feedstock for the next phase of Cypark\\u2019s project, which is to generate electricity using biogas or biomass. The electricity generated will then be sold to Tenaga Nasional Bhd.\nWe continue to be positive about Cypark\\u2019s RE prospects, underpinned by the country\\u2019s RE aspirations. Given Cypark\\u2019s position as the only major RE developer, we believe it is in a prime position to capitalise on any new RE projects. Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd\nTarget price: RM21.40 HOLD UOB KAY HIAN RESEARCH (Sept 30): Management is expecting crude palm oil price to pick up to about RM2,250 to RM2,300 per tonne in the coming months after the peak production season. Biodiesel demand plays an important role in supporting the CPO price. At the current crude oil price, the wide gap between the CPO price and crude oil price has led to more demand for biodiesel.\nThe refining margin in Indonesia has since normalised, and it is now feeling the margin pressure that Malaysia is experiencing. KLK has two refineries in commission in Indonesia with a total capacity of 3,000 tonnes per day. Back in February, KLK entered into a joint venture with UEM Sunrise Bhd to develop two projects in Iskandar Malaysia. Management is expecting contribution from these two projects to come in in two to three years\\u2019 time and this would be a focus for KLK going forward, in addition to its Bandar Seri Coalfields township development. We are expecting its property division to contribute 5% to FY14\\u2019s total Ebit. \nThis article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on October 6-12, 2014."}, "723": {"date_posted": "28/10/2014", "title": "Lead Story: Look for gems in small and mid-cap space", "article": " MALAYSIA\\u2019s fuel price hike from a subsidy cut effective Oct 2 \\u2014 just a week ahead of\\u00a0Friday Oct 10\\u2019s\\u00a0tabling of Budget 2015 \\u2014 was generally expected by economists and stock market experts. While there are those who think the move could have been better timed, the experts say subsidy rationalisation is inevitable for the government to achieve its 3.5% of GDP budget deficit target for 2014. Simply put, without a subsidy cut, the Malaysian government is likely to overshoot its projection on expenses for 2014 based on its spending in the first half of this year. In a note following the 20 sen/litre subsidy cut that raised RON95 prices to RM2.30 per litre and diesel to RM2.20 per litre, Citi Investment Research\\u2019s Wei Zheng Kit estimates that the fiscal savings from the government\\u2019s move could be between RM1.8 billion and RM2 billion for 4Q2014, higher than his initial estimate of RM0.8 billion. This is given that market prices for RON95 and diesel have fallen from the RM2.73 per litre and RM2.80 per litre assumed when the earlier 20 sen per litre fuel price hike happened on Sept 3, 2013. The Malaysian government, which is believed to be on track to achieve its Budget 2014 deficit target, following the week prior to Oct 6\\u2019s subsidy cut, still needs to spend over RM21 billion to subsidise RON95, diesel and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for 2014 \\u2014 a sizeable amount that will better aid the intended recipients in the lower income groups, through a target subsidy scheme. The current unsubsidised market price is RM2.58 per litre for RON95 and RM2.52 per litre for diesel, the Domestic Trade, Cooperatives and Consumerism Ministry reportedly said. Subsidy rationalisation and the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from\\u00a0April 1, 2015\\u00a0are two main reasons economists expect higher inflation next year and why stock market experts have been looking for winners in a rising inflationary environment for more than a year now. \\u201cBasically, you see rising business costs in a rising inflationary environment,\\u201d says RHB Research Institute Sdn Bhd Executive Chairman Lim Chee Sing, who is a well-respected economist. In a subdued growth environment \\u2014 where major world economies are unable to transition from a recovery to an economic boom \\u2014 corporations, Lim says, do not have much pricing power because demand growth is not strong. \\u201cAs a result, margins are being squeezed everywhere, particularly for Corporate Malaysia. There is a general lack of earnings growth to create new shareholder value for investors,\\u201d he explains. \\u201cThe key for investment, therefore, is to identify growth stocks that will create value for investors. These are found mainly in mid- to smaller-cap stocks and that is why the FBM Small Cap index has gone up by 19.3% year-to-date versus -1.3% for the FBM KLCI benchmark,\\u201d Lim says, adding that earnings growth for these so-called growth stocks can come from the execution of new contracts, capacity expansion or M&As in spite of lower margins. Berjaya Auto Bhd, Tambun Indah Land Bhd, Matrix Concepts Holdings Bhd, Scientex Bhd, Press Metal Bhd, Eastern & Oriental Bhd (E&O) and Tune Ins Holdings Bhd are a few examples of the kind of stocks Lim is referring to. Among the bigger-cap stocks, Lim says investors should look out for buying opportunities on market weakness. The latter may arise when a particular stock has been oversold for rich valuations that value emerges. Lim points out that SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd\\u2019s stock price has retracted 15.7% year-to-date, Bumi Armada Bhd shares have tumbled 21.4% year-to-date, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) has shed 16.4% year-to-date while Guinness Anchor Bhd is down 18.9% this year. Vincent Khoo, who heads UOB KayHian Research in Kuala Lumpur, also likes Bumi Armada, which he describes as among the laggards with defensive businesses that investors should look out for. \\u201cInflation will be an issue to contend with for a period of time [in Malaysia] \\u2026 However, we are going counter against the rest of the world, which is experiencing some deflation,\\u201d says Khoo, who expects details on the implementation of GST and further subsidy rationalisation to hog the limelight at the tabling of Budget 2015. Expectations are that a targeted subsidy programme, particularly for fuel, will feature in the unveiling this Friday (Oct 10) of Budget 2015, themed \\u201cAccelerating Growth, Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability and Prospering the Rakyat\\u201d. The new mechanism is likely to segregate the subsidy on RON95 and diesel based on the user\\u2019s individual income versus the current blanket subsidies regime that also subsidises the higher-income group. \\u201cIn light of the rising cost of living and inflationary pressures, particularly on the vulnerable groups, we expect [subsidy rationalisation] to be accompanied by continued and possibly higher cash transfers, a continuation of people-friendly measures such as the affordable housing scheme,\\u201d Khoo tells clients in an Oct 1 note. \\u201cWe maintain our view that ample domestic liquidity will continue to support a stretched end-2014 FBMKLCI target at 1,930 points, which pegs the index at 16.1 times forward earnings, despite peakish valuations and softening economic fundamentals. \\u201cWe also still expect modest outperformance by small/mid-caps, amid the pullback of speculative stocks since the trading volume exceeded seven billion shares on\\u00a0Aug 14, and continue to advocate fundamentally-sound small-mid caps with near-term event catalysts,\\u201d Khoo adds. UOB KayHian\\u2019s top picks are Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB), Deleum Bhd, Barakah Offshore Petroleum Bhd, Uzma Bhd, and SKP Resources Bhd, which it reckons has the potential of capturing new contracts with its potential synergistic merger with sister company Tecnic Group Bhd. The research house\\u2019s large-cap picks are Gamuda Bhd, SapuraKencana, Bumi Armada and Tenaga Nasional Bhd. Chan Ken Yew, who heads Kenanga Research, also cites strong domestic liquidity as among the \\u201csaving graces\\u201d for the local equities market following the recent conclusion of an uninspiring 2Q2014 corporate earnings reporting season, in which 37.4% of companies under coverage turned in below-par results. This is worse than the 32% in the first quarter of 2014 and 34.4% in 4Q2013. While rich market valuations and unexciting earnings growth would cap upside potential for the Malaysian market, Chan \\u2014 who has a 1,910 points KLCI target for 2014 and 1,980 points for end-2015 \\u2014 also reckons downside could be limited and advocates a \\u201cbuy-on-weakness strategy\\u201d. \\u201cThe easiest way to capitalise on the favourable 4Q performance is to identify the year-to-date underperformers for a potential brief rebound due to window dressing activities,\\u201d Chan says, citing SapuraKencana and Petronas Chemicals as examples. While most domestic sectors, especially direct consumer spending driven companies, will be affected by rising inflationary pressures, Chan recommends GST beneficiaries and export-driven companies such as Malaysian Pacific Industries and VS Industry Bhd that could also benefit from a weaker ringgit. He also likes stocks and sectors buoyed by corporate exercise newsflow such as Malaysia Building Society Bhd, RHB Capital Bhd and Sime Darby Bhd that may spin off some units. Whether or not these stock picks will turn out to be prescient, what\\u2019s certain is inflation is set to accelerate in 2015 when the 6% GST is implemented on\\u00a0April 1, 2015. And given that the government is targeting to bring down its budget deficit to 3% in 2015 and work towards a balanced budget by 2020 while bringing down its debt levels that are near its self-imposed levels of 55% of GDP, experts say the government would likely find it easier to bring down its subsidy bill than its emolument bill that makes up an even larger slice of its operating expenditure. Economists at RHB Research reckon that the government \\u201cmay even have to look into rationalising other subsidies as well on a gradual pace in order to reduce its operating expenditure\\u201d. \\u201cAlthough this may translate to higher inflationary pressure in the short term, it will likely be manageable if it is implemented on a\ngradual basis,\\u201d the RHB economists wrote in a Sept 24 note, pointing out that the RM43.3 billion spent on subsidies accounted for 20.3% of the government\\u2019s total revenue in 2013. Despite an anticipated moderation in 2014, the RHB economists say subsidies \\u201cremain sizeable and are still uncomfortably high\\u201d. Subsidies only accounted for 2.9% to 7.8% of revenue in 2000 to 2004, compared with an average of 18.4% a year in 2008 to 2013. They forecast inflation to average around 3% to 3.4% in 2014 and expect the government to take steps to reducing GST-driven price inflation, which could increase the burden of debt on consumers. They estimate the overall impact on full-year Consumer Price Index to be 1.5 percentage points based on a 6% GST starting\\u00a0April 1, 2015, and expect additional items to join the zero-rated list after public feedback. As it is, nearly one-third of the 944 items in the CPI basket will be zero-rated. Basic food items such as rice, sugar, salt, flour, cooking oil, lentils, herbs and spices, salted fish, piped water supply, and the first 200 units of electricity per month for domestic consumers are not subject to GST. Services not subject to GST include those provided by the government such as the issuance of passports, healthcare, school education, transport services and highway tolls. RHB\\u2019s inflation forecast is in-line with the 3.3% median inflation forecast for 2014, according to a poll of 21 houses by Bloomberg. For 2015, the median forecast rises to 3.5%, with forecasts ranging from Credit Agricole\\u2019s 2.5% to Nomura Securities\\u2019 5.2%. While higher inflation would hamper consumer sentiment, the government needs to make a tough decision to reduce its subsidies to a more sustainable level. \\u201cAs a whole, while the government is on course to meet its fiscal deficit target, fiscal reforms must continue so as to instill greater confidence of the country managing its public finances and the economy, thereby leading to a potential improvement in the country\\u2019s sovereign ratings,\\u201d the RHB economists add.

How long will the stellar financial performance and share price rally last? Its CEO Datuk Kamarul Redzuan Muhamed targets Uzma to sustain its revenue growth pace of 40% in the next three years, at least.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Besides the RM1.8 billion order book that will keep income flowing in for three years, his confidence hinges on its expansion plans, including acquisitions that have been made and a few that are in the pipeline. Kamarul, who founded the company, stresses that Uzma\\u2019s three core businesses \\u2014 geoscience and petroleum engineering, drilling and well services, and production, operation and optimisation services \\u2014 are expected to expand significantly over the next few years, allowing the group to embark on special projects such as brownfield rejuvenation and risk service contracts (RSCs). \\u201cWe plan to expand our drilling and well services significantly. We plan to inject the bulk of our capital expenditure from our recent rights issue [worth RM78 million] to grow this segment and become a regional player,\\u201d Kamarul tells The Edge. He discloses that Uzma is eyeing at least two more RSCs from Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas). \\u201cWe plan to take on more RSCs before we hit our resource and cash limits. At the moment, we still have the capacity to take on two to four RSCs,\\u201d he says. Kamarul acknowledges that RSCs are a high-risk game. But Uzma\\u2019s expertise in enhanced and improved oil recovery has given the company advantages in developing marginal oilfields, which require high efficiency. In fact, Uzma was earlier hired by Petronas to conduct studies on the reserves of the domestic marginal oilfields. \\u201cWe are already providing the services for these projects and although we already have good sustainable recurring income growth, we will be able to see further upside if we take on these special projects,\\u201d he says, adding that the projects will give Uzma longer earnings visibility. Uzma took on its first RSC in April with foreign partner EQ Petroleum Developments Malaysia Sdn Bhd to develop Tanjung Baram Field off the coast of Sarawak. Uzma has 30% equity interest in the nine-year contract worth RM326 million while EQ Petroleum holds the remaining 70%. \\u201cOur plan is to drill two wells and tie them to an existing platform for processing. We plan to get the first production by the end of the first quarter next year and I am confident about it as Tanjung Baram is a proven field,\\u201d says Kamarul. Although the first production is expected to come in 11 months after the signing of the agreement, Kamarul says Uzma obtained a two-month extension due to weather factors. Uzma is expected to start drilling in January instead of next month. Nonetheless, Kamarul, who is also the single largest shareholder of the company, stresses that RSCs are just one of Uzma\\u2019s core activities. He points out that the recent acquisitions of Well Services (Thailand) Ltd and MMSVS Group Holdings Ltd for a total of RM95 million have added the \\u201cmissing jigsaw pieces\\u201d to the company\\u2019s well services. \\u201cWe now have the complete value chain in well services.\\u201d And this is the division that will earn Uzma recurring income. \\u201cAll oil wells need to be serviced regularly. Most wells are aged between five and eight years and this requires high maintenance. The acquisitions [in Thailand] now give us the capability to take on a [full] range of well services projects,\\u201d says Kamarul. He adds that the acquisitions brought in new technology to the group, adding a fleet of modern hydraulic workover units (HWUs) and a truck mounted service rig. Uzma has the largest fleet of HWUs in Asean. Furthermore, the takeover of Premier Enterprise Corp (M) Sdn Bhd (PEC), which is involved in the supply of chemicals for oil recovery, is another feather in its cap. The acquisition, which expands the group\\u2019s market share in the business to more than 50%, is expected to be the next phase of growth for Uzma. Being a subsea services company, Uzma is also looking to win contracts for brownfield rejuvenation. \\u201cWe have done several studies on brownfields and we believe that these projects fit into our portfolio,\\u201d says Kamarul. \\u201cBrownfield rejuvenation projects provide Uzma with a better contracting strategy as we get paid for the barrels that we produce as well as the subsea services required for the projects,\\u201d he adds. \\u00a0 Kamarul points out that the key to rejuvenating brownfields is to repair the wells. \\u201cWhen the wells are not producing, they become idle. We have our own internal solution for this, as we have the full value chain.\\u201d Winning a brownfield project will make Uzma a regional player in oil and gas upstream services. \\u201cWe are looking forward to participating in brownfield projects. Whether we win the contracts or not, we\\u2019ll live to fight another day.\\u201d He adds that although Uzma prefers brownfields located in Malaysia, as it has already conducted the relevant studies and has locally-based assets, it is also looking overseas. \nThis article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on September 22-28, 2014."}, "732": {"date_posted": "14/10/2014", "title": "Insider Asia\\u2019s Stock Pick: Willowglen MSC", "article": " \nWillowglen MSC Bhd WILLOWGLEN provides systems and solutions for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA),a computerised system for gathering and analysing real time data system.

However, Shanghai pared initial heavy losses and Hong Kong ended in positive territory after Chinese official data showed a better than expected rise in the mainland's exports and imports. Investors are warily watching events in Hong Kong as clashes erupted in the city between pro-democracy protesters and masked men, hours after police began removing barricades that have blocked some main roads for the past two weeks. Shanghai, which sank more than one percent in early trade, ended down 0.36 percent, or 8.53 points, at 2,366.01. Hong Kong reversed morning losses to close 0.24 percent higher, adding 54.84 points to 23,143.38. Sydney gave up 0.63 percent, or 32.8 points, to close at 5,155.5 and Seoul ended 0.71 percent lower, easing 13.71 points to 1,927.21. Tokyo was closed for a public holiday. Global markets have felt the effect in recent weeks as traders fret over the state of the global economy, with China, the eurozone and Japan struggling even though the United States is clawing its way back to health. The latest indicators on the global outlook came from Beijing Monday, with official data showing September exports rose 15.3 percent year-on-year and imports climbed 7.0 percent. The rise in exports accelerated from August's 9.4 percent and was ahead of the median forecast of 12.5 percent. The forecast had predicted a fall of 2.4 percent in imports, matching a surprise decline in August. Customs spokesman Zheng Yuesheng attributed the improvement to a recovery in major economies and a strengthening of external demand. \"The good momentum is expected to continue in the fourth quarter,\" he added. But while the figures beat expectations, traders are still worried about the strength of world's number-two economy. Desmond Chua, market analyst at CMC Markets, told Dow Jones Newswires the data \"was a lot more disappointing than we had expected\" and \"cements the view that China might be in for quite a hard landing\". - Hong Kong clashes - On currency markets, the dollar eased to 107.36 yen from 107.65 yen in New York Friday, while the euro was at $1.2665 against $1.2627. The single currency was also at 136.01 yen, from 135.97 yen. The yen, which is considered a safe bet in times of turmoil, has rallied in the past as equities markets have fallen. Wall Street's three main indexes ended in the red on Friday. The Dow fell 0.69 percent, the S&P 500 tumbled 1.15 percent and the Nasdaq slumped 2.33 percent. In Hong Kong dozens of masked men rushed barricades at the main pro-democracy site Monday, triggering clashes, hours after police had moved in to remove some barriers and shrink the site. Taxi drivers, many of whom have voiced frustration with more than two weeks of protests that have blocked roads and caused traffic gridlock, added to the fray by converging on the site -- beeping horns and shouting at demonstrators. Oil prices tumbled again on pessimism about demand. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for November delivery fell $1.45 to $84.37 -- its weakest for two years -- while Brent North Sea crude lost $1.79 to a four-year low of $88.42.

The outspoken local fund manager noted that overall, the local O&G sector carries more \\u201csell\\u201d calls than \\u201cbuy\\u201d ratings at the moment. \\u201cThe valuation [of O&G firms] is very rich [and the] profit margins they are earning are not sustainable. [With the] price they [investors] are paying and what they get in return, it doesn\\u2019t make sense,\\u201d Tan told\\u00a0The Edge Financial Daily\\u00a0in a recent interview. However, he noted that Petronas Dagangan Bhd is a different counter compared with other O&G firms as \\u201cit is more of a marketing, retailing and distribution channel\\u201d. Although he acknowledged that Petronas Dagangan\\u2019s valuation is slightly on the high side, he said the downstream O&G products retailer and marketer has done a good job in competing with O&G firms such as British Petroleum (BP), Royal Dutch Shell plc (Shell) and Esso. iCapital.biz Bhd, a closed-end fund managed by Capital Dynamics, had 7,100 shares in Petronas Dagangan valued at RM171,536, as of\\u00a0June 25\\u00a0this year.

Bursa Malaysia, which has a price-to-earnings ratio of 17 times to 18 times, is also not attractive at the moment due to its high valuation, Tan said, noting that \\u201cwe won\\u2019t be having so much cash otherwise\\u201d. Asked about his top stock picks, he said \\u201cat this moment it\\u2019s hard to find a stock that is specifically attractive to us\\u201d, and added that the company would hold on to its RM250 million cash hoard for the time being. \\u201cWe need a little bit of patience and the day will come when there will be a lot of attractive stocks to be bought,\\u201d Tan said. Apart from Petronas Dagangan, iCapital.biz owns 19 million shares (2.89%) and 3.48 million shares (2.75%) in Padini Holdings Bhd and Tong Herr Resources Bhd respectively. \\u201cAt the right price, we will take profit from Padini,\\u201d he said, noting that Tong Herr\\u2019s earnings have been going up. On its fund\\u2019s performance, the net asset value (NAV) per share rose 2% from RM2.99 in June 1 last year to RM3.05 on May 31 this year. As at Oct 1, its NAV was at RM3.06. In the same period, its fund\\u2019s market price rose 5% from RM2.40 to RM2.52 on the back of an increase of 5% in the FBM KLCI. Its counter climbed 0.41% to close at RM2.43 last Friday, with a market capitalisation of RM340.2 million. On another note, Tan said he is not concerned about the substantial stake that City of London Investment Management Co Ltd owns in his company, which stands at 9.88% or 13.83 million shares according to iCapital.biz\\u2019s 2014 annual report. \\u201cThis is a free market. The most important thing is that as a fund manager we manage the funds to the best of our ability. They do their usual company visits like any other analysts will do,\\u201d he said, adding that while their stake is sizeable, the remaining 90% plus stake is also substantial, \\u201cso we have to make them [the majority] happy\\u201d. As to a possible tie-up between European hedge fund Laxey Partner Ltd and City of London, Tan said \\u201cit\\u2019s very hard to tell if they are in collaboration or not\\u201d, adding that he had done a background check on the latter, but found nothing conclusive. It is believed that Laxey Partner attempted to take over iCapital.biz in 2012 but failed to grab any seat on its board.

Zainal said the proposed purchase of the units for RM203 million is of mutual benefit to both companies, as the OGPC group would also be able to leverage Dagang Nexchange\\u2019s (DNex) status as a public listed entity to gain access to the capital market. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a privately held company which has reached its critical point \\u2014 it\\u2019s difficult for it to upscale on its own. I think it\\u2019s a bold and calculated move that benefits shareholders since OGPC has the track record and expertise ... the key is that we would be a niche player in the market and not stray too far from OGPC\\u2019s core competencies,\\u201d he said in an interview with The Edge Financial Daily. Zainal said once the proposed acquisition is completed, DNex intends to scale up the business and enter the regional market. \\u201cWe would like to scale up by offering additional services, products and equipment to both the upstream and downstream. More importantly, we want to become a regional player. \\u201cOGPC would be asset light, but focused on technical know-how and competency. We\\u2019re not interested in acquiring capital-expenditure-heavy assets,\\u201d he added. Zainal said one way for OGPC to expand outside Malaysia is by providing support services for Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u2019s (Petronas) overseas ventures. OGPC is a bumiputera group licensed by Petronas as an approved supplier of O&G equipment and services, and is principally involved in the provision of engineering and technical support services. It is also a supplier and service provider for specialised equipment and parts. OGPC Sdn Bhd\\u2019s shareholders are Azman Karim (52.5%), Abdul Manaf Shariff (17.5%) and Khoo Kok Seng (30%). The company has almost zero gearing with a cash pile of about RM50 million pre-acquisition. The acquisition of OGPC was first proposed by DNex in June this year, and is expected to be completed by early next year. On funding the group\\u2019s expansion plans, Zainal said the company would need to take on fundraising exercises \\u2014 not just for the proposed acquisition, but also a possible rights issue in the future to raise capital for any future funding needs. On the group\\u2019s core information technology business, Dagang Net Technologies Sdn Bhd,\\u00a0Zainal said other than scaling up he is also looking at opportunities to provide IT solutions to the O&G industry. He noted that working with the government with the implementation of the goods and services tax is also an option, but the main priority for DNex next year is the expansion of OGPC\\u2019s business in Malaysia and to make inroads into foreign markets. \\u201cI hope by 2015, OGPC is better and larger in terms of business reach within the O&G industry, and hopefully also supporting other parts of the economy like the oleochemical and power industries in terms of equipment,\\u201d he said, adding that the possibility of diversifying into other industries would not be ruled out. For the first half ended June 30, 2014 (1HFY14) DNex more than doubled its net profit to RM5.5 million from RM2.3 million in 1HFY13.

We are neutral on the news of the proposal. Effective valuation works out to be around RM25,500 per hectare, which we think is fair as it is near to the landbank valuation there. Additionally, APL owns a 60-tonne per hour palm oil mill. On the positive side, FGV\\u2019s landbank should increase 7% to 380,526ha from 355,864ha currently. However, we gather that APL made a loss of US$10.4 million (RM33.1 million) in FY13, possibly due to its young estate profile, with only 32% matured so far. Hence, we expect earnings contribution to come in only from FY16E onwards as more trees mature. Recall that in the recent results announcement, management believes that the market conditions and crude palm oil price are challenges facing the plantation industry, and FGV\\u2019s performance is likely to be affected accordingly. \\u00a0 Mah Sing Group Bhd\nTarget price: RM2.58 HOLD\nUOB KAY HIAN RESEARCH (Sept 2): Mah Sing\\u2019s 1H14 results were in line with expectations.

In 2Q14, Mah Sing registered about RM781 million in property sales, driven mostly by Southville City @ KL South in Bangi, Icon City in Petaling Jaya and The Meridin @ Medini.

We are positive about this as it indicates the company\\u2019s contract wins are trickling in. We estimate this contract raised Muhibbah\\u2019s outstanding order book to RM1.8 billion. This is still less than one times its FY13 revenue. We note that Muhibbah\\u2019s current tender book stands at RM7 billion, with half of the bids made up by the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) project. We have only assumed contract wins of about RM100 million from the RAPID project in FY14. We keep our earnings forecasts at this juncture as the contract value is within our FY14 and FY15 estimates. As a holder of a fabrication licence from Petronas, we believe the company will be a major beneficiary of the RAPID jobs and offshore fabrication projects.

Separately, the company added three new offshore construction and subsea services (OCSS) contracts worth RM392 million, taking its order book to RM28.2 billion. We welcome both announcements, although we flagged them in earlier notes. The latest gas discovery came less than three months after SapuraKencana made four gas discoveries in SK408, bringing the total gas discovered to more than three trillion cubic feet. We expect the first gas from all five discoveries to come through in no earlier than 1QFY18, potentially providing significantly longer earnings visibility. SapuraKencana remains our top pick among the oil and gas big caps. We advise investors to accumulate the stock as SapuraKencana offers solid order book and earnings visibility, supported by its E&P venture and two long-term contracts in Brazil as well as various OCSS and drilling contracts.

Second-quarter earnings fell 11% q-o-q due to lower non-interest income (-21%) and higher provisions (+21%). The softer non-interest income was led by weak treasury and markets due to low volatility, and weak investment banking (IB) activity due to low equities volume and deals as well as higher cost base. Net interest margin ticked up q-o-q, but fell y-o-y. Although expenses were flat q-o-q, cost-to-income ratio rose to 59% on weaker revenue. Group pre-tax profit was dragged by CIMB Niaga, but operations in Singapore and Thailand continued to grow steadily while Malaysia\\u2019s was flat. Loan growth was flat due to weak corporate loans. Deposits grew 2.5% q-o-q, led by wholesale deposits. Furthermore, the Indonesian market will remain challenging in 2HFY14. Although management expects the IB, treasury and market businesses to pick up, they remain as wild cards.

Response to Phase 1 (GDV: RM120 million) has been encouraging, with 60% take-up and 40% completion rates. However, strong earnings growth is only expected in FY16 as the group plans to recognise property earnings on a completion basis. The outlook for Harbour-Link\\u2019s engineering division remains bright, with the current order book standing at RM120 million and tender book at RM1 billion.

It operates the largest retail station network in Malaysia with more than 1,000 Petronas petrol stations. PetDag is the market leader in the commercial gas (market share: around 68%) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) (around 57% market share) segments in Malaysia. It comes in second in both the retail (around 3%) and lubricants\\u00a0 (around 13%) segments. In 2012, PetDag ventured overseas and it now has a presence in Thailand (lubricants), Vietnam (LPG) and the Philippines (lubricant and LPG). PetDag\\u2019s share price has retreated 36% so far from the peak of RM31.82 on Dec 31, 2013, no thanks to the two Malaysia Airlines air disasters within the last six months. Even then, PetDag is still trading at 24 times price-earnings ratio currently, which is at a 55% premium to the KLCI as opposed to the 150% premium from the peak. It has been trading at a premium since February 2011 when the company started its high dividend payout of 89% to 95% for three years from, below 60% earlier. The question now is how much premium investors are willing to pay for the stock. Historical data shows that PetDag has been trading at a 79% premium since February 2011, and at 89%, 69% and 50% premiums for the three-year, four-year and five-year means. While PetDag is expecting a weak financial year 2014 ending Dec 31 (FY14) due to higher operating cost, stronger business volumes are set to drive its earnings higher, to be led by the retail segment. We expect PetDag\\u2019s earnings to grow at 4.5% three-year compound annual growth rate in FY13 to FY16E. Although gone are the days of distributing exceptionally high dividend payout of 85% to 94%, we still expect generous payout of 70% over FY14E to FY17E given its strong operating cash flow generating ability of above RM1 billion a year. This implies a decent net yield of 2.6% to 3.1%. This is also backed by a minimum 50% dividend payout policy. Although we like its business model and generous earnings payout, we believe PetDag is fairly priced at the moment, although its share price has retreated 36% from the peak. Even then, it is not a stock to be ignored given its parent is Petroliam Nasional Bhd and its status as an index stock. In our opinion, this stock will remain as a core holding for investors\\u2019 portfolio benchmarking purposes. In addition, the share price downside is likely to be capped by steady earnings growth as the fear of declining jet fuel demand is overdone since it only makes up about 10% of the group\\u2019s revenue. As such, we are initiating coverage on PetDag with a \\u201cmarket perform\\u201d rating and a target price of RM19.64, which implies calendar year 2015 22.7 times price-earnings ratio and around 50% premium to the market valuation. \\u2014 Kenanga Research, Sept 10  \nThis article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on September 11, 2014. \n\\u00a0"}, "754": {"date_posted": "8/9/2014", "title": "IFCA MSC, Eversendai, CAP, Delloyd Ventures, Berjaya Auto, Ho Hup Construction, oil and gas related stocks", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Sept 08): Based on news flow and corporate announcements today, companies that may attract investors' attention tomorrow (Sept 09) include the following: IFCA MSC Bhd, China Automobile Parts Holdings Ltd (CAP), Delloyd Ventures Bhd, Berjaya Auto Bhd, Ho Hup Construction; and oil and gas sector related stocks such as UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd, Eversendai Corp Bhd and KKB Engineering Bhd. IFCA MSC Bhd says Brahmal Vasudevan has ceased to be a substantial shareholder of the company after disposing 11.25 million shares. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, IFCA MSC says the savvy investor disposed the shares on Sept 2. However, it did not state the transaction price. To recap, Brahmal emerged as a substantial shareholder of the company when he bought a 5.55% equity stake in IFCA MSC on Aug 27. It is believed that the frenzied buying interest in IFCA is partly driven by its latest quarterly earnings. IFCA MSC reported RM3 million in net profit for the second quarter ended June 30 compared with barely RM578,000 in the previous corresponding period.

The contract is for the provision of drilling rig services for drilling campaigns for Vietnam operations, whereby UMW-OG Group will assign its newest rig, UMW NAGA 6 for the contract. The contract is for four firm wells (approximately 250 days), with three optional wells (estimated 55 days) and thereafter, an extension option of three wells (estimated at 277 days). \"The commencement of the contract is expected to take place in early October this year immediately upon UMW-OG group taking delivery of the new rig - UMW NAGA 6, later this month,\" UMW-OG says in a statement. UMW NAGA 6 is currently under construction by China Merchants Industry Holdings Co Ltd, at a shipyard in Shenzen, Mazhou Island, China. KKB Engineering Bhd also announced that its associate company, OceanMight Sdn Bhd has bagged a RM14.5 million contract from 2H Offshore Engineering Sdn Bhd to provide fabrication, hook-up and commissioning services for the Tanjong Baram Wellhead Platform. KKB told Bursa Malaysia that the commencement period would be this month, and scheduled fabrication completion in March 2015. Eversendai Corp Bhd has secured its maiden oil and gas (O&G) contract for two separate packages worth a combined RM72.2 million. In a statement to Bursa Malaysia today, Eversendai says its unit, Eversendai Oil & Gas (M) Sdn Bhd, bagged a mechanical and steel structure packages contract for Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd's Terengganu Gas Terminal (TGAST) Project \\u2014 Phase 2.

Automotive components makers China Automobile Parts Holdings Ltd (CAP) told Bursa Malaysia today that it is exploring a dual listing on the Main Market of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to further generate its visibility and publicity. The company had on Sept 5, appointed Hong Kong-based consulting firm JRK Capital Ltd to provide advisory services and feasibility study in relation to the proposed dual listing. CAP says a successful dual listing will generate higher visibility and publicity for the company and its subsidiaries' businesses. \"The proposed dual listing will provide retail and institutional investors in another exchange with an opportunity to participate in the equity and continuing growth of the group, which will broaden and diversify CAP\\u2019s shareholder base,\" the automobile chassis component manufacturer says. CAP says the proposed dual listing will create a new listing platform for CAP shares.

According to its Group Managing Director (MD) and co-founder Datuk Seri Tee Boon Kee, regardless of whether Delloyd Ventures will be privatised successfully or remain as a listed entity, its business will remain as usual. He adds that the independent advice circular (IAC) is expected to be despatched in November. Speaking to the reporters after the group\\u2019s annual general meeting here today, Deputy Group MD Datuk Leon Tee Wee Leng says the revised take-over offer price of RM5.20 \"will be the final price at the moment\". \"The prospects for both autoparts manufacturing as well as plantation sectors, are not that great. To us, the offer price has already reflected a premium over the future earnings of the company,\" he says. Berjaya Auto Bhd\\u2019s (BAuto) net profit more than doubled to RM56.1 million for its first financial quarter ended July 31, 2014 (1QFY15) from RM26.09 million a year ago, largely due to higher sales of Mazda vehicles in Malaysia and the Philippines. Revenue rose 18.6% year-on-year to RM507.95 million from RM428.42 million in 1QFY14. Earnings per share for 1QFY15 rose to 6.95 sen per share from 3.62 sen per share a year ago.

The counter was down 6 sen or 1.94% at RM3.04, as at 12.25 pm. It had risen to as high as RM3.12 at 9.12am, but investors resorted to taking profit thereafter. \\u00a0 Some 540,000 shares changed hands. MEB told Bursa Malaysia yesterday, that it has bagged a RM100 million contract from BASF Petronas Chemicals Sdn Bhd to build a new aroma chemical complex and relevant facilities for the Lemongrass Project, located in Kuantan, Pahang. \"The job will commence immediately and will be completed in two years. The contract is expected to contribute positively to the earnings and net assets of Muhibbah group, for the current and future financial years,\\u201d said the company. In a note to clients today, Alliance DBS Research Sdn Bhd said that MEB needs to secure more jobs to provide a comfortable degree of earnings visibility. \"We are cautious on Muhibbah\\u2019s thinning orderbook balance,\" said Alliance DBS analyst Jeremy Goh, adding that at a cover of only 0.9 times financial year revenue, more sizable job wins are needed to provide a comfortable degree of earnings visibility for the group. \"With the recent (RM100 million) job at hand, we estimate year-to-date orderbook replenishment for its construction division to stand at RM221 million. This would translate to an overall orderbook balance (including cranes and shipyard) of RM1.8 billion,\" he said. Goh noted there were several potential job wins in the pipeline, including contracts from RAPID, where MEB has tendered RM3 billion to RM4 billion via subcontracts to the main engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning (EPCC) contractors. \"However, we caution that securing these contracts hinges on the main EPCC contractors that MEB has partnered with, to win the jobs to begin with,\" he said. Nevertheless, Alliance DBS is maintaining its \"hold\" call on the stock, with an unchanged target price of RM3.20, based on 15 times of financial year 2015 earnings. The research house projected MEB's revenue for FY14 and FY15 at RM1.52 billion and RM1.56 billion, and net profit at RM75 million and RM89 million respectively. Meanwhile, Kenanga IB Research retained its \"outperform\" rating on MEB, as the contract value is within its FY14 new jobs assumptions. \"We are maintaining our sum of parts (SOP) derived target price of RM3.55. This implies forward price to earnings ratio (PER) of 14.6 times FY15 earnings per share (EPS), which is still within mid-cap sized construction peers\\u2019 historical PER range of 12-15 times,\" said Kenanga analyst Iqbal Zainal. \"We continue to like Muhibbah, due to its unique business structure that offers flexibility in infrastructure, marine engineering and O&G jobs, its ability to leverage on its internationally-recognized Favelle Favco\\u2019s brand name, and long-term earnings visibility, backed by stable and growing recurring income from its concessions,\" he said. \"We are positive on Muhibbah\\u2019s job flows. This is the fourth O&G related contract secured by the group, so far this year. Including this contract, Muhibbah\\u2019s YTD job wins amounted to RM221 million or 32% of our RM700 million new jobs assumption for FY14. \"We believe the remaining (about RM400 to RM500 million) new orders will be secured by the group before end of FY14, and are likely from Petronas and RAPID project,\" he added.

This is only 94% and 90% of our and consensus estimates. The major variation was the higher prize payout, although we understand the group made (undisclosed) charitable donations in the quarter. Gaming revenue per outlet per draw fell 3.2% y-o-y. BToto has proposed a fourth interim dividend of seven sen per share, taking total dividend payout for FY14 to 26.5 sen. This implies a 106% payout ratio based on core earnings. However, 9.5 sen was distributed in the form of 30.6 million treasury shares. BToto is left with only 2.9 million treasury shares, so we believe the generous payout is unlikely to recur. The stock lacks near-term re-rating catalysts and there are downside risks to earnings.

We projected overall FFB production to grow 10% to 13% in FY03/15-17 (versus 9.3% to 10% previously), underpinned by a 26% to 43% increase in FFB production in Indonesia over the next three years. We are raising our FY03/15-16 net profit forecasts by 5.3% and 12% respectively, largely to account for higher FFB yield and lower production cost assumptions for its Indonesian operations. Based on our sensitivity analysis, every RM100 per tonne increase in our average CPO price assumption will raise our FY03/15-17 net profit forecasts by 8.3% to 8.6%. We raise our target price on the stock by 12.1% to RM3.81, based on unchanged 17 times revised FY03/16 EPS of 22.4 sen.

The P3 members (Maersk, MSC and CMA CGM) have announced that the P3 plan will now be scrapped. Despite its solid earnings delivery and strong non-P3 volume growth, Westports\\u2019 share price performance has been lacklustre since its listing in October 2013 because of concerns about P3. Given the latest development, we believe Westports will see an overdue re-rating. it trades at an implied forward PER of 18 times, below its regional peers\\u2019 average of 22 times. We are reversing the potential impact and raising our full-year container volume growth to 10% and 9% for FY14 and FY15 respectively. Consequently, our FY14-FY16 EPS forecasts are raised by 2%, 4% and 4% respectively and our discounted cash flow-derived target price is nudged up to RM2.85, indicating a forward PER of 19 times.

Meanwhile, 9MFY14 revenue dropped 3.9% y-o-y owing to lower selling prices while core net profit declined 4.6% because of the poorer performance from China and the higher effective tax rate. Thus, we are reducing our FY14-FY16 net profit forecasts by 5% to 8%, trimming our target price, still based on 14.5 times PER (about 20% discount to Hartalega). We maintain a \\u201chold\\u201d on Top Glove but prefer Kossan. Top Glove declared its first dividend for FY14, a single-tier dividend per share of 7 sen, in line with our forecast. We think that Top Glove has been able to contain its operating costs quite well through aggressive cost-optimisation initiatives. This can be seen from the stronger Ebitda margin, although it was impacted by the large foreign exchange loss in 9MFY14. The higher Ebitda margin was also driven by higher sales contribution from nitrile.

The results were a tad higher than our full-year projection and the consensus estimates by 29% and 14% respectively, deviated by stronger-than-expected earnings contribution from its associate Mazda Malaysia Sdn Bhd, and higher-than-expected margins owing to favourable MYR/JPY rates and better sales mix. \\u00a0 Post-results, our FY15 earnings forecast has been revised upwards by 30% to account for higher revenue, underpinned by stronger sales assumption following the group\\u2019s attractive new model pipelines and sustainable EBIT margin of 11.2% on the back of the favourable exchange rate and lower import duties. We have nudged up our target price after we rolled over to FY15 with a higher targeted PER of 13 times to align with its industry peers\\u2019 valuation.

With 80% in hand, the group announced an acquisition of the remaining 20% in F&B Nutrition Sdn Bhd (F&B) for RM112.9 million via the issuance of 39.753 million shares at RM2.84 apiece. The price tag implies a valuation of about 15 times for the entire business. We are making a \\u201ctrading buy\\u201d call on the stock. Full value to all holdings. Its collective stakes in Kian Joo Can and F&B are worth RM1.05 billion. Setting off the group\\u2019s huge borrowings of RM388.2 million (as at March 31, 2014) against that amount leaves us with a residual of RM658.5 million, valuing Can-One at RM3.43 per share on the enlarged share base. If the Aspire Insight deal collapses and Kian Joo reverts to RM2.80 per share, Can-One is still worth about RM2.75. Sime Darby Bhd\nTarget price: RM10.40 NEUTRAL\nRHB RESEARCH (June 17): Sime Darby has entered into a sale and purchase agreement (S&P) with B. Grimm Power Ltd for the disposal of a 100% stake in Sime Darby Power Co Ltd (SDPC), Sime Darby LCP Power Co Ltd (SDLP), and Sime Darby O&M (Thailand) Co Ltd (SOMT), for a total cash consideration of US$162.9 million (RM522.9 million). The disposals are expected to be completed this month. The disposals do not come as a surprise, as Sime Darby sold off its Malaysian power plant in April for RM300 million in a bid to dispose of its non-core assets. We maintain our sum-of-parts (SOP)-based fair value of RM10.40 and our \\u201cneutral\\u201d recommendation. Although we are still positive on the plantation sector as a whole, the weaknesses at Sime Darby\\u2019s heavy equipment and motor division could be a threat to earnings growth, despite its sensitivity to crude palm oil (CPO) prices. Hence, we advocate shifting away from the more integrated players to the purer planters, which would benefit more significantly from CPO price movements. Sarawak Cable Bhd\nFair value: RM1.70 HOLD \nAMRESEARCH (June 17): We place our \\u201cfair value\\u201d rating for SCable under review, pending further details on the proposed acquisitions that were announced yesterday. SCable has accepted a conditional offer from HNG Capital Sdn Bhd for the former to purchase 100% equity interests in Universal Cable (M) Bhd and Leader Cable Industry Bhd for RM210 million. The offer will fortify SCable as the leading cable manufacturer in the country with an estimated market share of more than 50%. We understand that following the acquisition, SCable will essentially supply all the cables for the 500kV job on a consolidated basis. The acquiree companies are two of the top suppliers in Peninsular Malaysia. Margins are likely to be similar with that of SCable\\u2019s existing power cable business. Note that non-independent and non-executive director Datuk Seri H\\u2019ng Bok San is the controlling shareholder of HNG. If accepted, we expect the share sale agreement to be finalised within 3Q before SCable seeks shareholders\\u2019 approval in an extraordinary general meeting. Hong Leong Industries Bhd \nTarget price: RM6.86 TRADING BUY\nUOB KAY HIAN (June 16): HLI and Narra will seek shareholders\\u2019 approval for a series of restructuring exercises, which will see a backdoor listing of HLI\\u2019s infrastructure business into Narra. We see a \\u201ctrading buy\\u201d opportunity as there could be significant upside to our sum-of-parts (SOP) valuation should Narra\\u2019s current implied valuation hold up. The implied post-exercise value of Narra at RM4.49 per HLI share is well above our RM2.30 for HLI. Narra\\u2019s implied post-exercise market cap is RM2 billion, implying a share price of RM4.16. While we doubt Narra\\u2019s present lofty valuation can sustain after the exercise, we acknowledge that it could fetch a valuation that is significantly above our appraised valuation. Should Narra\\u2019s valuation hold up after the restructuring, our adjusted SOP valuation and target price for HLI would be RM10.39 and RM9.26 respectively. This compares with our target price of RM6.86, which assumes Narra shares at RM2.30 per HLI share and a 20% holding company discount to our SOP valuation of RM5.70 for HLI\\u2019s remaining assets. Alliance Financial Group Bhd \nTarget price: RM5.40 BUY\nAFFIN INVESTMENT BANK (June 17): We are of the view that AFG\\u2019s stock price decline is overdone since news of Alliance Bank Malaysia group CEO\\u2019s resignation was made public on June 5. The banking group is backed by a solid management team and has a proven track record in the delivery of results and its relationship management. Management is striving to achieve key performance indicators for FY15 by replicating FY14\\u2019s loan growth of 14.1% y-o-y in FY15E, and achieving a higher return on equity of above 14% in FY15E. With the share price correction, which has provided investors an upside of 15% to our target price of RM5.40, we revise our rating from \\u201cadd\\u201d to \\u201cbuy\\u201d. We continue to like the stock, given the attractive dividends, with a net yield of 4.8% to 5.8% in FY15-FY17, subsequent to a slight increase in the payout ratio from 50% to 60% (which was announced during the last results quarter). Management is more proactive and will continue to focus on achieving near-term strategic priorities, such as a 30% non-interest income ratio. Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd\nTarget price: RM10.55 BUY\nHONG LEONG INVESTMENT BANK (June 16): MAHB released weak statistics for May, showing passenger movement growth of only 2.1% y-o-y, owing to the impact of the MH370 crisis and kidnappings in Sabah, capacity rationalisation (especially on domestic routes) and high base effect (strong traffic during the election in May 2013). Nevertheless, year-to-date passenger growth remained strong at 13.5% y-o-y versus HLIB\\u2019s forecasted +12.8% y-o-y for FY14. KLIA experienced a decrease of -11% on China sector routes alone (about 10% of the overall passenger movement) after the MH370 and kidnapping of Chinese incidents. We believe MAS as the main airline operator in KLIA\\u2019s main terminal building (-3.2% y-o-y in May) severely affected MAHB. Since mid-May, local airlines \\u2014 MAS, AirAsia Group (including AirAsia X) and Malindo \\u2014 have been aggressive in their marketing campaigns to fill up increasing flight capacity. Hence, we expect a recovery in June-July (impact normalisation) and MAHB remains the major beneficiary.

A tariff review for the pass-through of fuel costs is scheduled for July. Ten days into June, the regulator has yet to announce any tariff changes.  Under an optimistic scenario for Tenaga, we estimate a potential hike of up to 3.5% in the July tariff. In our view, the quantum of the July tariff is secondary. What is more important is for the Energy Commission to make a statement to signal to the market that the fuel cost pass-through mechanism is in place.  We continue to be bullish on Tenaga as we believe investors have yet to price in its longer-term earnings growth potential. Present expectations merely revolve around a stable earnings base under the incentive-based regulation framework, in our view. We value Tenaga using discounted cash flow, assuming 7.2% weighted average cost of capital and 1% long-term growth. Berjaya Auto BhdTarget price: RM3.20 BUYRHB RESEARCH (June 10): Berjaya Auto is poised to book a record quarter with earnings of RM48 million, along with record-high margins achieved during the period. These were helped by a better sales mix, a reduction in import duties, the favourable RM/JPY rate, and increased localisation. We also attribute the robust performance to its flattish overhead costs. We expect to see a record bottom-line margin of 11% in 4QFY14, or 9% for FY14. We raised our margin estimates after taking into consideration the cost savings derived from increased localisation, decreased import duties, forex movements and flattish overhead costs. We also fine-tuned our sales assumption. Our profit after tax and minority interest estimates for FY14, FY15 and FY16 are RM132 million, RM188 million and RM215 million respectively. Our earnings forecasts for FY14, FY15 and FY16 are nudged up by 11%, 21% and 14% respectively. Thus, we peg our stock to a new target CY15 PER of 12.5 times to derive a new target price of RM3.20. IJM Corp BhdTarget price: RM7.45 BUYUOB KAY HIAN (June 10): IJM plans to privatise IJM Land by acquiring the remaining 35.85% stake it does not own at RM3.55 per share. The transaction will value IJM Land at RM5.5 billion \\u2014 12% lower than our RNAV valuation for IJM Land. Despite this, we believe shareholders of IJM Land should accept the deal as they would be able to gain access to IJM\\u2019s balance sheet and the liquidity of their shares would be greatly enhanced via IJM\\u2019s shares. IJM\\u2019s move makes sense as it is an earnings accretive exercise given the positive outlook on IJM Land. Recall that IJM Land\\u2019s total unbilled sales remain healthy at about RM2 billion, which should provide earnings visibility for the next three years. We understand that IJM Land will eventually need to raise funds as it will need about RM2 billion of working capital over the next two to three years. Hence, it would make sense to privatise IJM Land as it can then leverage on IJM\\u2019s balance sheet for funds. Coastal Contracts BhdTarget price: RM4.82 BUYALLIANCE DBS RESEARCH (June 9): Coastal held an inaugural analyst briefing last week, addressing its growth plans via the jack-up drilling rig and the gas compression service unit contract. The group sees growing demand for more specialised vessels. This is positive for Coastal as specialised vessels yield stronger margins of 20% compared with the group average of 15% to 18%. Pemex is reportedly seeking to contract up to eight units for its enhanced oil recovery programme, and Coastal could secure up to two more contracts because of its first-mover advantage. This would further support its move to derive more recurring income streams. However, the contracts, if they materialise, are likely to be earnings accretive only from FY16 or FY17 onwards. Coastal\\u2019s maiden jack-up drilling rig is slated for delivery in 4Q14 and expected to be chartered out by 1Q15. The group is actively marketing for a contract and hopes to announce one along with the rig delivery. We have included this in our estimates, assuming a daily charter rate of US$166,000. KKB Engineering BhdFair value: RM2.50 HOLDAMRESEARCH (June 10): We maintain an unchanged fair value of RM2.50 per share \\u2014 a 5% discount to our SOP value of RM2.63 per share. KKB\\u2019s prospects have been greatly enhanced following the discovery of natural gas offshore Sarawak. SapuraKencana Petroleum announced that its subsidiary, SapuraKencana Energy Sarawak Inc, has made four significant discoveries of non-associated natural gas in its SK408 Production Sharing Contract area, offshore Sarawak. We understand its oil and gas associate Oceanmight is targeting fabrication works for offshore structures of below 10,000 tonnes and up to 20,000 tonnes. KKB holds a direct 43% stake in Oceanmight and an indirect 20% stake via 40%-owned associate Edisi Optima Sdn Bhd.  We understand it is bidding for projects with a price range of RM100 million to RM300 million, eyeing jobs involving general structures such as wellheads, jacket and drilling platforms, leading to topsides. We maintain \\u201chold\\u201d, in view of its slow progress in securing projects in its conventional activities of building engineering and pipe manufacturing. Public Bank BhdTarget price: RM19.20 SELLMAYBANK IB RESEARCH (June 9): Public Bank held its EGM and its rights issue was approved with the issue price fixed at RM13.80 per rights share on an entitlement basis of 1-for-10 rights. Against its original guidance of a price discount of 20% to 35%, Public Bank\\u2019s recent jump in share price has afforded it a more attractive discount that is at the higher end of the range.  We estimate an enhancement in the group\\u2019s end-March CET1 ratio to a comfortable 10.3% from 8.5% with this issuance. We estimate a marginal 7% decline in FY15 EPS and a dilution in the group\\u2019s return on average equity to 16.6% from 19.3%. While we are positive on this capital-raising exercise, which will put Public Bank in a comfortable equity position, the issue for us continues to be the stock\\u2019s valuations against the backdrop of declining return on equities. We maintain our \\u201csell\\u201d call with a raised target price of RM19.20 from RM18 on an unchanged price-to-book value of 2.7 times. SapuraKencana Petroleum BhdTarget price: RM5.45 BUYAFFIN INVESTMENT BANK (June 10): SKP announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, SapuraKencana Energy Sarawak Inc, has made four significant discoveries of non-associated natural gas in the SK408 Production Sharing Contract area offshore Sarawak. Its partners are Petronas Carigali (30%) and Sarawak Shell Bhd (30%). We are positive on the gas discovery \\u2014 the gross gas column of 139 to 333 metres, coupled with good existing infrastructure and nearby production hubs suggest that SK408 is likely to be commercially viable. The total capex for the 10 exploration wells is estimated at US$217 million. The gas discovery reaffirms our positive view on the acquisition of Newfield\\u2019s Malaysia oil and gas assets. We continue to like SKP for its strong management, integrated business model, extensive oil and gas assets, growing international footprint and strong earnings growth potential. Key risks to our positive view are a sharp decline in crude oil price, lower-than-expected new contract wins and operational hiccups. Puncak Niaga Holdings BhdTarget price: RM3.40 HOLDAMRESEARCH (June 11): Puncak Niaga has reached an agreement in principle for Kumpulan Darul Ehsan Bhd\\u2019s proposed acquisition of its 100% stake in Puncak Niaga (M) Sdn Bhd, and 70% stake in Syabas. The agreement was reached following a series of negotiations between Puncak, KDEB/Selangor government and the federal government. The parties will negotiate further before reaching a definitive agreement. The deal is also conditional on Puncak shareholders\\u2019 approval in an EGM to be conducted soon. Based on the offer, Puncak will be getting RM1.55 billion or RM2.91 per share \\u2014 equivalent to the equity portion of the offer that was made last February. However, the \\u201cassets to be assumed\\u201d portion has been eliminated. In return, KDEB will assume the whole assets and liabilities.We view the change positively as it appears to clear uncertainties over Syabas\\u2019 receivables owed by the state government, and its payables to the water treatment players. We believe a portion of the proceeds would be retained as the group is looking to acquire assets for its oil and gas arm. Brahim\\u2019s Holdings BhdTarget price: RM2.97 BUYHONG LEONG INVESTMENT BANK (June 10): Despite the recent selldown in Brahim\\u2019s share price due to weak market sentiment and concerns about the impact from MAS on earnings, we remain positive about Brahim\\u2019s long-term growth as fundamentals are still solid. If MAS cuts its capacity by 30%, Brahim\\u2019s would be impacted at most by 22.5%. However, we view this as unlikely given that travellers would opt for other airlines, which are likely Brahim\\u2019s existing customers. We remain confident of Brahim\\u2019s existing operations and expect its full-year results to be in-line with our forecasts of RM28.4 million in profit after tax and minority interest, largely boosted by a larger customer base, the opening of klia2 and interest savings from loan refinancing. Its venture in Makkah will start to contribute significantly in FY15 and FY16 by RM4 million, and RM7 million to RM8 million respectively. Do note that the kitchen is expected to only complete and commence operations in FY16 and the contributions in FY15 are from the shipping of its currently ready-to-eat products to Makkah. Malaysia Airports Holdings BhdTarget price: RM7.73 HOLDCIMB RESEARCH (June 10): Management reiterated its aspiration to become a \\u201cglobal leader in creating airport cities\\u201d by 2020, turning 30% of its 22,156-acre landbank in Sepang, Selangor, into a KLIA Aeropolis. As MAHB has limited expertise in property development, these future developments will involve a joint-venture partner. MAHB\\u2019s vision of turning KLIA and its vicinity into an airport city is part of its goal to reduce its dependence on aeronautical income. Reactivating the idle terminal at Sabiha Gokcen airport will cost about \\u20ac50 million, cheap for the incremental five million annual pax capacity it generates. Any required expansion capex above that would be contingent upon a concession extension beyond 2030.  klia2 will be a key earnings driver for MAHB once the terminal\\u2019s retail outlets are fully open. A narrowing in airport tariffs between KLIA main terminal building and klia2, if it materialises, would also boost MAHB\\u2019s profits. But capacity rationalisation at MAS and operating cost uncertainty at klia2 will keep its share price in check in the near term, in our view.Eastern & Oriental BhdTarget price: RM2.99 ADDCIMB RESEARCH (June 10): At Invest Malaysia, E&O said it wants to be the \\u201caspirational brand\\u201d that property buyers aspire to own, and the key differentiating factor between the company and many others is the passion of its people to make the E&O brand the gold standard.  There were no major surprises from the briefing as we had written about the company\\u2019s recent developments in the May results note as well as the flash note on the share purchase after getting clarification from management. Nonetheless, we continue to look forward to the imminent progress that will be made on getting approval for the reclamation of the RM25 billion to RM30 billion STP2 land, as that is arguably the single largest and most important prime project on Penang island. Investors should continue accumulating E&O shares on the back of two potential key catalysts: the benchmark purchase price of the 9.9% block at RM2.90 and positive news flow on the reclamation of the STP2 land. I-BhdTarget price: RM4.13 TRADING BUYKENANGA RESEARCH (June 10): I-Bhd\\u2019s recent proposed corporate exercise, which will raise about RM700 million for the funding of its development projects and the acquisition of three parcels \\u2014 Kia Peng land, Soho Land and Tower Land with a collective gross development value of RM3.7 billion out of its total RM9.5 billion GDV \\u2014 would enable the group to better plan and execute its development plans in i-City and KLCC, which would sustain it for another 10 to 15 years.  Assuming conservative sales of RM354 million and RM560 million for FY14 and FY15E respectively, we are projecting its property division\\u2019s top line to grow 84.5% and 78.7% y-o-y in FY14 and FY15E to RM177.3 million and RM316.8 million respectively.  As for its leisure division, we are projecting at least 20% top-line growth given that it will be one of the key tourist spots in the Visit Malaysia campaign, which in turn translates into 24% of its FY14E earnings of RM60.9 million. I-Bhd\\u2019s earnings are set to grow by 70% and 65% in FY14 and FY15E respectively.

Our earlier checks with other developers indicated that they were less likely to bid for the project as most of them already had enough projects in hand at the moment. However, we believe that the strongest contender would still be Malaysian Resources Corp (MRCB), given its expertise in developing central transport hubs and the common major shareholder for both Kwasa Land Sdn Bhd and MRCB is the Employees Provident Fund. Assuming that MRCB wins this first development project on a 64.1-acre parcel, we estimate that it could potentially boost the company\\u2019s RNAV by 30 sen per share. While valuations are within fair value range, we foresee a protracted consolidation period for the sector as: a) property prices are peakish; b) the property market requires a digestion period as supply rushes in; and c) the tightening regulatory cycle has been slowing secondary sales. CB Industrial Product Holding BhdFair value: RM4.95 NEUTRAL RHB RESEARCH (June 02): CB Industrial Product\\u2019s (CBIP) 1QFY14 core net profit was in line with our and consensus estimates, coming in at 23% to 24% of FY14 forecasts. No dividend was declared for this quarter. Core net profit rose 24.7% y-o-y, but revenue contracted 18.4%. The decline in top line was mainly due to a 57.7% drop in revenue from the vehicle retrofitting division because of lower project completion during the period. However, this was offset by a 22.6% rise in earnings from the oil mill engineering division due to higher project billings. Despite the in-line earnings, we are revising our FY14-15 forecasts downwards by 4% to 5% after taking into account the higher losses at its plantation division in Indonesia, which were due to start-up costs. Post-earnings revision and after rolling over our valuation base to 2015, our SOP-based fair value drops slightly to RM4.95 from RM5. Our valuation targets are unchanged, at nine times PER for its associate plantation business and 13 times PER for its oil mill engineering and vehicle retrofitting division.  Mah Sing Group BhdTarget price: RM2.47 HOLD HONG LEONG INVESTMENT BANK (June 04): Mah Sing announced an increase in gross development value (GDV) for Southville [email\\u00a0protected] South, from the preliminary RM5.13 billion to RM8.3 billion. The developer attributed this to the recently approved township master plan. The key difference is the commercial component \\u2014 previously, the project was to comprise low-rise shopoffices, but will now feature high-rise commercial blocks consisting of office towers, SoHos, serviced apartments, a shopping centre and possibly hotels. The commercial zone will occupy 60.21 acres fronting the North-South Expressway.  The take-up for its latest phase in Southville was also encouraging, at 80% for the Avens Residence released last weekend. Southville has been a success for the group, having generated RM600 million sales to date. We still believe it is premature to turn \\u201caggressive\\u201d on property developers at this point in time, given the uncertain outlook arising from macro and sector headwinds.  Tenaga Nasional BhdTarget price: RM12.32 NEUTRAL PUBLIC INVESTMENT BANK (June 02): It was reported that the Energy Commission (EC) has awarded Project 4A via direct negotiation to a consortium comprising Tenaga Nasional, YTL Power International Bhd and SIPP Energy Sdn Bhd. The proposed combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant, to be built in Pasir Gudang, Johor, will have a capacity of 1,000mw to 1,400mw. Being a fast-track project, the plant\\u2019s commercial operation date has been brought forward to 2018, as opposed to the original 2020 target, according to the EC\\u2019s plant-up schedule.  We estimate the project will cost RM2.5 billion to RM3.5 billion, based on the cost of the Prai CCGT power plant, which Tenaga won in 2012. While the tariff has not been disclosed, the EC has stated that the award was conditional upon a comparable levelised tariff, with the Prai plant\\u2019s winning bid of 34.7 sen per kWh as reference. Nonetheless, we believe earnings contribution to Tenaga, while positive, will not be significant.  Kian Joo Can Factory BhdTarget price: RM3.83 BUY TA SECURITIES (June 02): Kian Joo Can Factory\\u2019s 1QFY14 net profit dropped 34.8% y-o-y to RM19.8 million. It came below our and the street\\u2019s estimates, making up 13% and 14% of full-year forecasts respectively. On the takeover, since the company\\u2019s directors have agreed to accept Aspire Insight Sdn Bhd\\u2019s offer of RM3.30 per share, there has not been any letter or circular issued by the independent adviser to date. Furthermore, Bursa Malaysia has given management more time to submit the draft circular to shareholders.  Although we are surprised by the company\\u2019s dismal performance in 1QFY14, it may be a premature reflection of its full-year earnings because of high plant start-up cost for its carton business and delay in passing higher raw material costs to customers. We roll forward our earnings to FY15 EPS of 33.3 sen, but maintain our PER of 11.5 times as we believe the company deserves a premium for its sound fundamental as highlighted many times previously.  Kimlun Corp BhdTarget price: RM1.60 UNDERPERFORM KENANGA RESEARCH (June 02): Kimlun Corp\\u2019s 1QFY14 core net profit of RM8.7 million is below expectations, accounting for 18.4% of our full-year forecast and 17.8% of consensus estimates. Note that we have excluded the after-tax disposal gain of RM10.77 million from the Nilai land from our core earnings figures. Y-o-y, Kimlun\\u2019s 1QFY14 core net profit dropped 3.3% despite a 34.6% increase in core revenue. This was mainly due to higher effective tax rate (+0.9 percentage point), selling and administrative expenses (+27.7% y-o-y) and finance costs (+43.1% y-o-y). The group\\u2019s gross profit margin improved by 1.6ppts due to a higher contribution from the property development division, which was more than enough to compensate for the lower margins from the construction and manufacturing divisions. Kimlun\\u2019s current outstanding order book of RM2.1 billion will provide earnings visibility for the next two years. The property development division\\u2019s contribution should pick up in FY14-15E, thanks to its unbilled sales of RM131 million.  Berjaya Auto BhdTarget price: RM2.90 BUY MAYBANK IB RESEARCH (June 04): Berjaya Auto\\u2019s (BAuto) 4QFY14 results are likely to beat consensus expectations. We expect the company to report a net profit of RM45 million to RM50 million (+52% to 69% q-o-q) in the quarter, with a higher gross profit margin (+1.5ppts to 17%), driven by a better sales mix and cost-savings from higher localisation and weaker ringgit-yen exchange rate. Mazda\\u2019s FY14 vehicle sales met our expectations, coming in at 9,500 units for Malaysia and 2,300 units for the Philippines.  We raise FY14/15/16 core net earnings by 23%/20%/20% after increasing our gross profit margin assumption to 17% (+1.5ppts), taking into account: (i) a more favourable exchange rate (from RM3.22/\\u00a5100 to RM3.17/\\u00a5100); (ii) higher localisation of content; and (iii) improved product mix. We continue to like BAuto for its strong earnings growth prospects (61% three-year net earnings CAGR). Growth will largely be driven by its strong new launches and superior cost control by the management. \\u00a0 Protasco BhdTarget price: RM2.90 BUY MIDF RESEARCH (June 03): HCM Engineering Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Protasco Bhd, has secured federal road jobs in Zone 2A in Sarawak, worth RM21 million. The contract was awarded by the Public Works Department for the construction of overtaking lanes from Sibu to Bintulu and from Bintulu to Tatau. Assuming a margin of 14% with a completion period of 12 months, we expect this project to contribute about RM1.3 million and RM1.6 million to the group\\u2019s FY14 and FY15 operating profits respectively.  We continue to like the company due to: (i) its healthy construction outstanding order book of RM700 million; (ii) the potential road construction jobs to be secured; (iii) its recurring maintenance concession earnings; (iv) its integrated flagship property developments on 100 acres in Bangi, Selangor, and 14.4 acres in Pasir Gudang Johor; and (v) its profit guarantee from the oil and gas business. Star Publications (M) BhdTarget price: RM2.55 HOLD ALLIANCE DBS RESEARCH (June 03): Star Publications\\u2019 e-paper subscriptions now stand at 80,000, up from 50,000 in 2H2013. This was helped by incentives given to vendors to promote the e-paper bundle to its 100,000 physical paper subscribers. Star is getting sponsorship from CIMB Group for the Asean ePaper (a collaboration between the company and three other English dailies in the region). The collaboration is done on a revenue-sharing basis, with 60% of the earnings going to the party that secures the sponsorship.  We think Star intends to leverage its wide English content as a source of growth beyond its print business. This has been demonstrated by its recent collaboration with Bloomberg TV Malaysia to provide business content. Star is expected to scale down its Sarawak operations by 3QFY14 as it is loss-making and the circulation figures are not meaningful. Contrary to previous guidance, the company is reviewing its voluntary separation scheme and does not plan to reduce its staff strength further for now. \\u00a0 Dialog Group BhdTarget price: RM4.16 ADD CIMB RESEARCH (June 01): Dialog has accepted a letter of intent from Australia\\u2019s Roc Oil Co Ltd for the farming out of 20% of Roc\\u2019s participating interest in a production sharing contract (PSC)\\u00a0 for three fields located off Sarawak. This will reduce Roc\\u2019s participating interest in the PSC to 30%. The remaining 50% of the PSC is held by Petronas. We understand that the fields are already in production. We view the surprise development favourably as it is a natural progression from Dialog\\u2019s participation in the risk sharing contract to develop the Balai marginal field cluster in a 32:48:20 joint venture between Dialog, Roc and Petronas.  All of Dialog\\u2019s upstream works are located in Sarawak waters. In addition to D35, D21, J4 and Balai, Dialog is working on the Bayan enhanced oil recovery project, offshore Sarawak, in a 50:50 JV with US-based Halliburton. Dialog is by far the biggest winner of oil and gas investments under the government\\u2019s Economic Transformation Programme through its involvement in both upstream and downstream projects. Panasonic Manufacturing Malaysia BhdTarget price: RM24.43 BUY MIDF RESEARCH (June 02): Panasonic posted 4QFY14 earnings of RM18.7 million, which was within our and market expectations, accounting for 22% of both our and consensus full-year forecasts. The company achieved a new revenue record of RM899.2 million for FY14, an increase of 4% y-o-y, mainly due to an increase in sales of fans in the domestic and foreign markets. Earnings for the quarter grew 32% y-o-y to RM18.7 million because of increased sales of its home appliances. Its FY14 earnings rose 7.6% y-o-y to RM80.8 million due to higher festive season sales in the third quarter. Moreover, its FY14 net margin increased 0.3ppt y-o-y.  Our target price of RM24.43 per share is based on a PER multiple of 16 times the group\\u2019s forecast FY15 EPS. The assigned multiple is derived from Panasonic\\u2019s five-year historical PER. Although the potential 12-month total return is slightly less than the 15% threshold required for our \\u201cbuy\\u201d recommendation, we are making an exception for Panasonic due to its dividend appeal. Sime Darby BhdTarget price: RM9.20 NEUTRAL JP MORGAN (May 29): Sime Darby reported 3QFY14 net profit of RM882 million (up 24% y-o-y), taking 9MFY14 net profit to RM2.2 billion (down 9% y-o-y), which was only 66% to 67% of our and consensus full-year estimates. Performance was weak across all segments, primarily plantation and industrial, which continued to see a decline in production and lower equipment sales respectively. While some degree of q-o-q production recovery may be expected in the plantation division going into 4QFY14 due to better weather, we do not think it as a sufficient catalyst for a higher stock price. We stay \\u201cneutral\\u201d as the stock could remain supported by the expectation of a potential restructuring of its property business, which may result in an eventual spin-off, although we believe this may not be imminent. The key downside risks to our price target include a further decline in CPO prices, cost overruns in Liberia oil palm operations and the economic slowdown leading to a diminished demand for heavy equipment and cars.

The national oil company is expected to spend RM300 billion in capital expenditure (capex) over the next five years to set up over 50 offshore exploration wells, which will trigger strong demand for offshore pedestal cranes, support vessels and platform fabrication works. In June 2013, Petronas had granted Muhibbah a licence as an Approved Supplier for the category of \\u201cOffshore Facilities Construction \\u2014 Major Onshore Fabrication\\u201d. With its complete package of capabilities in building ships, cranes, fabricated structures, pipelines, terminals, tanks and other oil and gas-related works, the group is positioning itself to garner a larger slice of the national oil company\\u2019s capex. Among Muhibbah\\u2019s major outstanding contracts are the Wiggins Island Coal Terminal Export Project in Australia (outstanding order book RM213 million), noise barriers and enclosures for MRT Corp (RM147 million), catering facility at Doha International airport (RM103 million), government buildings in Putrajaya (RM31 million) and refurbishment of the terminal buildings at Phnom Penh and Siem Reap airports (RM83 million). Looking to secure new contractsThe group hopes its two projects in the Middle East \\u2014 the earlier completed Yemen LNG project and the Doha International Airport catering facility \\u2014 will also open the doors to more projects in the region. Qatar in particular, is investing heavily in infrastructure ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Meanwhile, Muhibbah\\u2019s Cambodian airport operations offer an attractive exposure to Cambodia\\u2019s economy, with gross domestic product growth of over 7% per year until 2015, supported by the strong tourism and textile industries. In 1QFY14, the Phnom Penh and Siem Reap airports saw a 10 year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in passenger arrivals to 1.69 million, following an already strong 18% growth in arrivals to 5.06 million for the whole of 2013. Growth will come from expansion of the two airports, as well as increased flights at the new third airport concession in Sihanoukville, the gateway to southern Cambodia\\u2019s beaches and islands, manufacturing base and newly discovered oil and gas deposits. 1QFY14 results within expectationsMuhibbah\\u2019s results for 1QFY14 were within our expectations, although they are 19% below our full year net profit on an annualised basis. We expect a stronger second half and 2015 as the group tenders for more projects, and Petronas\\u2019 Rapid project comes to fruition. Pre-tax profit for 1QFY14 came in at RM30.9 million, up 3.4% y-o-y while net profit was relatively flat, rising 1.8% to RM20.2 million. This was achieved on the back of revenue totalling RM393.9 million, up 2% y-o-y. The flattish growth in turnover and profitability in 1QFY14 reflects the completion of several large construction projects in the second half of last year, notably the South Klang Valley Expressway, which was completed in October 2013. Share of associates increased 18.2% from RM13 million to RM15.4 million, reflecting continued growth in its concession business, especially the Cambodian airports which saw a 10% rise in passenger arrivals in 1QFY14. As at May 22, 2014, Muhibbah\\u2019s outstanding order book stood at RM1.86 billion, up slightly from RM1.83 billion on Feb 21, 2014. This shows healthy order book replenishment as revenue recognised in 1QFY14 amounted to almost RM400 million. The order book comprised RM704 million from infrastructure construction, RM1.11 billion from cranes and RM45 million from shipyard.

The Lam Son project is PTSC\\u2019s first and key core target, with Yinson having a 49% working interest in the FPSO.

CEO Hassan Basma is eyeing even more contracts and has been actively seeking jobs. \\u201cIf you want economies of scale and to be respected, you have to be right there at the top. In the oil and gas (O&G) business, you need to have relevance to your client. When you are No 1, you are the prize taker,\\u201d he tells The Edge in an exclusive interview. Bumi Armada has a fleet of eight FPSOs, but Hassan says the group plans to own 14 or 15 of them. \\u201cWe expect to get two FPSOs this year and subsequently one or two every year.\\u201d It was no small feat for Bumi Armada to get up there among the O&G giants in a span of nine years, but Hassan says it was hard to convince Bumi Armada\\u2019s board of directors to get into the FPSO business and \\u2014 even more daunting \\u2014 to venture outside the country and, of all places, into Nigeria. \\u201cThe first thing I had to tell them was that it was a good business, and it was. Then, I said we could do it because we were assembling an international team and I thought we would win [the contract],\\u201d Hassan recalls. Eventually, he received the board\\u2019s blessing. Of course, Hassan adds, it helped that he was formerly the president of Far East Single Buoy Mooring (SBM), a prominent FPSO owner, and was born in Nigeria. \\u201cI was able to demonstrate to them [Bumi Armada\\u2019s board] that I knew the country and the clients there very well. I suppose it was a lesson in management: if you want to convince somebody, you have to know your topic,\\u201d says Hassan, who has more than three decades of experience in the O&G industry. During his tenure at SBM, the company was involved in building Malaysia\\u2019s first FPSO at the Kikeh field, off the shores of Sabah. The Dutch company also built the first gravity-actuated pipe (GAP) at Kikeh. When Hassan joined Bumi Armada in 2005, he moved the group away from being merely a provider of harbour tugs, which, in his own words, are built to \\u201cgo out to the sea and come back in the evening\\u201d, to bigger things \\u2014 being a provider of offshore support vessels (OSVs) and floating services. While most Malaysian O&G players have started moving abroad only recently, Bumi Armada already has a global footprint. Revenue from its Malaysian operations has averaged 22.09% over the past three years. \\u201cWe are in 19 countries in five continents. Our workforce is made up of 38 nationalities. We have big operations in Angola, Brazil, Africa, Central Asia and now, the UK,\\u201d Hassan says proudly. The source of its revenue of RM2.07 billion generated in financial year 2013 ended Dec 31 is geographically diverse: 52.92% from Asia (excluding Malaysia), 29.09% from Africa, 13.59% from Malaysia and 4.4% from Latin America. While Hassan says Bumi Armada is eager to work more with state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) and has done so, the company\\u2019s foray overseas was born out of necessity. \\u201cNecessity is the mother of invention, as the saying goes. When I came to Bumi Armada in 2005, MISC Bhd dominated the local FPSO business. This boiled down to not entering the business at all or going outside [Malaysia],\\u201d he explains. \\u201cPeople thought we were crazy, but here we are.\\u201d Going overseas paid off, says Hassan, especially in the Atlantic corridor where there is a lot of oil. \\u201cMalaysia has smaller oil reserves compared with other parts of the world. The real oil is in Brazil, Angola and Nigeria and the Atlantic corridor.\\u201d Bumi Armada\\u2019s FY2013 net profit of RM431.19 million, or 14.71 sen per share, was 19.88% higher than FY2011\\u2019s RM359.67 million or 14.63 sen per share. Revenue jumped 34.27% between the three financial years to RM2.07 billion. While the big gap in the growth of the top and bottom lines indicates a margin compression over the years, Bumi Armada\\u2019s FY2013 net margin of 20.8% is higher than those of a few other local O&G companies, such as SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd (7.59% in FY2013 ended Jan 31) and Yinson Holdings Bhd (7.05% in FY2014 ended Jan 31). Only SapuraKencana can claim a bigger order book than Bumi Armada\\u2019s with RM26.9 billion as at early April. According to Hassan, the group\\u2019s earnings visibility is secure for eight years, thanks to a backlog, which works out to average revenue of RM4 billion per year. Assuming a net margin of 20%, this would mean a profit of RM800 million per year. Even so, Hassan says Bumi Armada is bidding for 10 jobs with a collective capital expenditure of US$15 billion. \\u201cOf course, we\\u2019re not going to get them all. They are, nonetheless, big jobs with big orders \\u2014 every contract has 10 years\\u2019 worth of backlog.\\u201d Although the group is still growing its FPSO business and showing year-on-year growth in earnings, Bumi Armada\\u2019s stock has disappointed since it was relisted on July 21, 2011. If an investor had subscribed for 1,000 Bumi Armada shares at its initial public offering (IPO), he would have seen a RM660 or 21.78% gain at the stock\\u2019s closing price of RM3.69 last Thursday, which gave the company a market capitalisation of RM10.82 billion, compared with SapuraKencana\\u2019s RM24.93 billion. Over the last year, Bumi Armada\\u2019s shares have underperformed the FBM KLCI, losing 9.56% when the benchmark index gained 8.08%. Last week alone, the counter dropped 21 sen or 5.38% and hovered near its one-year low, coincidentally around the time Bumi Armada announced a cash call to raise between RM2.23 billion and RM2.25 billion via a one-for-two rights issue. It also proposed a one-for-two bonus issue. Moving forward, Bumi Armada\\u2019s share base will grow from 2.93 billion to between 5.86 billion and 5.92 billion. According to RHB Research\\u2019s estimates, these exercises would dilute Bumi Armada\\u2019s earnings per share by half in FY2014 and FY2015. Roughly RM1.76 billion of the proceeds from the rights issues will be set aside for the company\\u2019s capex needs. Of this, RM1.4 billion will be allocated to its FPSO business. Bumi Armada said in its announcement that one of the FPSO jobs it is bidding for could be awarded over the next 24 months. The possible location is listed as Asia, Africa or Latin America. Meanwhile, RM80 million will be allocated to the OSV business, RM200 million to establish and expand Bumi Armada\\u2019s subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines (SURF) fleet while the remaining RM80 million is intended for the construction or purchase of subsea well intervention equipment for enhanced oil recovery activities. \\u201cIt shows that we\\u2019ve got expansion plans,\\u201d says Hassan, adding that Bumi Armada\\u2019s growth will come from the services business. \\u201cWe\\u2019re betting heavily on liquefied natural gas (LNG) vessels and SURF.\\u201d Bumi Armada\\u2019s largest shareholder is Objektif Bersatu Sdn Bhd \\u2014 a private vehicle of business tycoon T Ananda Krishnan \\u2014 with 42.25%. The Employees Provident Fund is next with 8.43%. Of the 20 analysts who cover Bumi Armada, 12 have recommended a \\u201cbuy\\u201d, seven a \\u201chold\\u201d and one a \\u201csell\\u201d, resulting in a consensus target price of RM4.37. Given the company\\u2019s confidence and analysts\\u2019 generally positive view, it will be interesting to see if Bumi Armada\\u2019s plans bear fruit. See accompanying excerpt of the interview with Hassan.  \\u2018We want to win the championship\\u2019  The Edge: Bumi Armada has eight floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels, and counting. Not only that, it now has an order book worth RM32 billion \\u2026  Hassan Basma: (Interjects) It\\u2019s not enough. Why? Let me ask you, who won the last season of the Premier League?  United.  And who got second?  (There is a pause)  Exactly my point. In this business, you have to have relevance to your client. When you are No 1, you are the prize taker, which will be the point where we get to have 14 or 15 FPSOs. Then, I expect more growth. We expect to get two FPSO contracts this year and subsequently one or two more every year. We want to win the championship, basically.  What about the size of your tender book?\nWe are involved in about 10 [bids] at the moment. Capex [capital expenditure] is about US$15 billion collectively. Of course, we\\u2019re not going to get all the jobs. But they are big jobs with big orders; every contract is worth 10 years of backlog. Our backlog is increasing rapidly and with it comes diversity in complexity and geography. Today, we don\\u2019t even compete on price anymore.\nOnce you\\u2019ve established yourself as a player, prequalification becomes easy. Initially, when we went all over the world knocking on doors, people went, \\u2018Bumi who?\\u2019 Now, we don\\u2019t have to try hard to be on the bidder\\u2019s list. In almost every major job being tendered out, Bumi Armada is a bidder.   You recently announced a proposal for a one-for-two rights issue and a one-for-two bonus issue. Can you explain why there\\u2019s a need for Bumi Armada to raise more funds?\nIt shows that we have expansion plans. FPSOs are getting bigger too. Let\\u2019s say for a US$1.5 billion FPSO, it is normally funded by 30% equity and 70% debt. On the equity side, that\\u2019s nearly US$500 million. If we have two of those, that\\u2019s going to be US$1 billion in equity. Obviously, some of the funding comes from our cash flow and retained earnings, but it comes to a point where we need to adjust the debt-to-equity ratio to keep within a prudent range of less than one times. If we hadn\\u2019t done that [the cash call], our gearing level would have reached about two times. We are comfortable with that; before our IPO, our gearing was even at four times. But why should we go higher? We need to raise equity, although we are going to raise debt as well with sukuk and eurobonds. But I made a point to the board that we must address the equity first and then the debt. We can raise it internally so then it becomes a lot easier and cheaper to get debt.  Bumi Armada is undergoing a fleet renewal programme with the vessels being made more fuel-efficient. What is the significance of this?  The impact on fuel and the environment is something a lot of our O&G peers in Malaysia haven\\u2019t truly appreciated. Whether you agree with global warming or not, regulation is getting tougher. I think Malaysia would not be too far behind in adopting some of these rules. They\\u2019re already in the Mediterranean, North Sea, Gulf of Mexico and Brazil. When the regulation gets tougher here, a lot of the vessels in this country might not fit the regulation.\nWhen it comes to fuel \\u2014 which is the biggest villain and the biggest cost \\u2014 the client pays for it today. But in many places in the world, they are putting the onus on us operators. Brazil, for example, has created a rule where the client pays the service provider strictly based on the given nameplate capacity. So, if you use more fuel, that\\u2019s your problem.  Where do you see Bumi Armada in five years\\u2019 time?\nI think we\\u2019ll own more gas-based assets like FSRUs (floating storage and regasification units). That\\u2019s the trend now. Also, I calculated that with 14 vessels, you would be earning US$8 million to US$9 million cash every day. Then the FPSO unit becomes a cash cow.\nNext, you need growth, which will come from the services side. We\\u2019re betting heavily on LNG vessels and SURF [subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines] because we believe that as we go deeper and further, there will be more subsea.\nIt\\u2019s a good problem to have when there\\u2019s too much cash later. Maybe we can do [share] buybacks, mergers and acquisitions \\u2026 This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on June 2 - 8, 2014."}, "786": {"date_posted": "6/6/2014", "title": "Edge Weekly: Special Report: Bumi Armada hungry for more", "article": " WITH an order book of RM32 billion, which should keep Bumi Armada Bhd busy for the next eight years, the world\\u2019s fifth largest owner of floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels is not about to rest on its laurels.

Given the company\\u2019s confidence and analysts\\u2019 generally positive view, it will be interesting to see if Bumi Armada\\u2019s plans bear fruit. See accompanying excerpt of the interview with Hassan.  \\u2018We want to win the championship\\u2019  The Edge: Bumi Armada has eight floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels, and counting. Not only that, it now has an order book worth RM32 billion \\u2026  Hassan Basma: (Interjects) It\\u2019s not enough. Why? Let me ask you, who won the last season of the Premier League?  United.  And who got second?  (There is a pause)  Exactly my point. In this business, you have to have relevance to your client. When you are No 1, you are the prize taker, which will be the point where we get to have 14 or 15 FPSOs. Then, I expect more growth. We expect to get two FPSO contracts this year and subsequently one or two more every year. We want to win the championship, basically.  What about the size of your tender book?\nWe are involved in about 10 [bids] at the moment. Capex [capital expenditure] is about US$15 billion collectively. Of course, we\\u2019re not going to get all the jobs. But they are big jobs with big orders; every contract is worth 10 years of backlog. Our backlog is increasing rapidly and with it comes diversity in complexity and geography. Today, we don\\u2019t even compete on price anymore.\nOnce you\\u2019ve established yourself as a player, prequalification becomes easy. Initially, when we went all over the world knocking on doors, people went, \\u2018Bumi who?\\u2019 Now, we don\\u2019t have to try hard to be on the bidder\\u2019s list. In almost every major job being tendered out, Bumi Armada is a bidder.   You recently announced a proposal for a one-for-two rights issue and a one-for-two bonus issue. Can you explain why there\\u2019s a need for Bumi Armada to raise more funds?\nIt shows that we have expansion plans. FPSOs are getting bigger too. Let\\u2019s say for a US$1.5 billion FPSO, it is normally funded by 30% equity and 70% debt. On the equity side, that\\u2019s nearly US$500 million. If we have two of those, that\\u2019s going to be US$1 billion in equity. Obviously, some of the funding comes from our cash flow and retained earnings, but it comes to a point where we need to adjust the debt-to-equity ratio to keep within a prudent range of less than one times. If we hadn\\u2019t done that [the cash call], our gearing level would have reached about two times. We are comfortable with that; before our IPO, our gearing was even at four times. But why should we go higher? We need to raise equity, although we are going to raise debt as well with sukuk and eurobonds. But I made a point to the board that we must address the equity first and then the debt. We can raise it internally so then it becomes a lot easier and cheaper to get debt.  Bumi Armada is undergoing a fleet renewal programme with the vessels being made more fuel-efficient. What is the significance of this?  The impact on fuel and the environment is something a lot of our O&G peers in Malaysia haven\\u2019t truly appreciated. Whether you agree with global warming or not, regulation is getting tougher. I think Malaysia would not be too far behind in adopting some of these rules. They\\u2019re already in the Mediterranean, North Sea, Gulf of Mexico and Brazil. When the regulation gets tougher here, a lot of the vessels in this country might not fit the regulation.\nWhen it comes to fuel \\u2014 which is the biggest villain and the biggest cost \\u2014 the client pays for it today. But in many places in the world, they are putting the onus on us operators. Brazil, for example, has created a rule where the client pays the service provider strictly based on the given nameplate capacity. So, if you use more fuel, that\\u2019s your problem.  Where do you see Bumi Armada in five years\\u2019 time?\nI think we\\u2019ll own more gas-based assets like FSRUs (floating storage and regasification units). That\\u2019s the trend now. Also, I calculated that with 14 vessels, you would be earning US$8 million to US$9 million cash every day. Then the FPSO unit becomes a cash cow.\nNext, you need growth, which will come from the services side. We\\u2019re betting heavily on LNG vessels and SURF [subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines] because we believe that as we go deeper and further, there will be more subsea.\nIt\\u2019s a good problem to have when there\\u2019s too much cash later. Maybe we can do [share] buybacks, mergers and acquisitions \\u2026 This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on June 2 - 8, 2014."}, "787": {"date_posted": "6/6/2014", "title": "Edge Weekly: Special Report - Bumi Armada hungry for more", "article": " WITH an order book of RM32 billion, which should keep Bumi Armada Bhd busy for the next eight years, the world\\u2019s fifth largest owner of floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels is not about to rest on its laurels. CEO Hassan Basma is eyeing even more contracts and has been actively seeking jobs. \\u201cIf you want economies of scale and to be respected, you have to be right there at the top. In the oil and gas (O&G) business, you need to have relevance to your client. When you are No 1, you are the prize taker,\\u201d he tells The Edge in an exclusive interview. Bumi Armada has a fleet of eight FPSOs, but Hassan says the group plans to own 14 or 15 of them. \\u201cWe expect to get two FPSOs this year and subsequently one or two every year.\\u201d It was no small feat for Bumi Armada to get up there among the O&G giants in a span of nine years, but Hassan says it was hard to convince Bumi Armada\\u2019s board of directors to get into the FPSO business and \\u2014 even more daunting \\u2014 to venture outside the country and, of all places, into Nigeria. \\u201cThe first thing I had to tell them was that it was a good business, and it was. Then, I said we could do it because we were assembling an international team and I thought we would win [the contract],\\u201d Hassan recalls. Eventually, he received the board\\u2019s blessing. Of course, Hassan adds, it helped that he was formerly the president of Far East Single Buoy Mooring (SBM), a prominent FPSO owner, and was born in Nigeria. \\u201cI was able to demonstrate to them [Bumi Armada\\u2019s board] that I knew the country and the clients there very well. I suppose it was a lesson in management: if you want to convince somebody, you have to know your topic,\\u201d says Hassan, who has more than three decades of experience in the O&G industry. During his tenure at SBM, the company was involved in building Malaysia\\u2019s first FPSO at the Kikeh field, off the shores of Sabah. The Dutch company also built the first gravity-actuated pipe (GAP) at Kikeh. When Hassan joined Bumi Armada in 2005, he moved the group away from being merely a provider of harbour tugs, which, in his own words, are built to \\u201cgo out to the sea and come back in the evening\\u201d, to bigger things \\u2014 being a provider of offshore support vessels (OSVs) and floating services. While most Malaysian O&G players have started moving abroad only recently, Bumi Armada already has a global footprint. Revenue from its Malaysian operations has averaged 22.09% over the past three years. \\u201cWe are in 19 countries in five continents. Our workforce is made up of 38 nationalities. We have big operations in Angola, Brazil, Africa, Central Asia and now, the UK,\\u201d Hassan says proudly. The source of its revenue of RM2.07 billion generated in financial year 2013 ended Dec 31 is geographically diverse: 52.92% from Asia (excluding Malaysia), 29.09% from Africa, 13.59% from Malaysia and 4.4% from Latin America. While Hassan says Bumi Armada is eager to work more with state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) and has done so, the company\\u2019s foray overseas was born out of necessity. \\u201cNecessity is the mother of invention, as the saying goes. When I came to Bumi Armada in 2005, MISC Bhd dominated the local FPSO business. This boiled down to not entering the business at all or going outside [Malaysia],\\u201d he explains. \\u201cPeople thought we were crazy, but here we are.\\u201d Going overseas paid off, says Hassan, especially in the Atlantic corridor where there is a lot of oil. \\u201cMalaysia has smaller oil reserves compared with other parts of the world. The real oil is in Brazil, Angola and Nigeria and the Atlantic corridor.\\u201d Bumi Armada\\u2019s FY2013 net profit of RM431.19 million, or 14.71 sen per share, was 19.88% higher than FY2011\\u2019s RM359.67 million or 14.63 sen per share. Revenue jumped 34.27% between the three financial years to RM2.07 billion. While the big gap in the growth of the top and bottom lines indicates a margin compression over the years, Bumi Armada\\u2019s FY2013 net margin of 20.8% is higher than those of a few other local O&G companies, such as SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd (7.59% in FY2013 ended Jan 31) and Yinson Holdings Bhd (7.05% in FY2014 ended Jan 31). Only SapuraKencana can claim a bigger order book than Bumi Armada\\u2019s with RM26.9 billion as at early April. According to Hassan, the group\\u2019s earnings visibility is secure for eight years, thanks to a backlog, which works out to average revenue of RM4 billion per year. Assuming a net margin of 20%, this would mean a profit of RM800 million per year. Even so, Hassan says Bumi Armada is bidding for 10 jobs with a collective capital expenditure of US$15 billion. \\u201cOf course, we\\u2019re not going to get them all. They are, nonetheless, big jobs with big orders \\u2014 every contract has 10 years\\u2019 worth of backlog.\\u201d Although the group is still growing its FPSO business and showing year-on-year growth in earnings, Bumi Armada\\u2019s stock has disappointed since it was relisted on July 21, 2011. If an investor had subscribed for 1,000 Bumi Armada shares at its initial public offering (IPO), he would have seen a RM660 or 21.78% gain at the stock\\u2019s closing price of RM3.69 last Thursday, which gave the company a market capitalisation of RM10.82 billion, compared with SapuraKencana\\u2019s RM24.93 billion. Over the last year, Bumi Armada\\u2019s shares have underperformed the FBM KLCI, losing 9.56% when the benchmark index gained 8.08%. Last week alone, the counter dropped 21 sen or 5.38% and hovered near its one-year low, coincidentally around the time Bumi Armada announced a cash call to raise between RM2.23 billion and RM2.25 billion via a one-for-two rights issue. It also proposed a one-for-two bonus issue. Moving forward, Bumi Armada\\u2019s share base will grow from 2.93 billion to between 5.86 billion and 5.92 billion. According to RHB Research\\u2019s estimates, these exercises would dilute Bumi Armada\\u2019s earnings per share by half in FY2014 and FY2015. Roughly RM1.76 billion of the proceeds from the rights issues will be set aside for the company\\u2019s capex needs. Of this, RM1.4 billion will be allocated to its FPSO business. Bumi Armada said in its announcement that one of the FPSO jobs it is bidding for could be awarded over the next 24 months. The possible location is listed as Asia, Africa or Latin America. Meanwhile, RM80 million will be allocated to the OSV business, RM200 million to establish and expand Bumi Armada\\u2019s subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines (SURF) fleet while the remaining RM80 million is intended for the construction or purchase of subsea well intervention equipment for enhanced oil recovery activities. \\u201cIt shows that we\\u2019ve got expansion plans,\\u201d says Hassan, adding that Bumi Armada\\u2019s growth will come from the services business. \\u201cWe\\u2019re betting heavily on liquefied natural gas (LNG) vessels and SURF.\\u201d Bumi Armada\\u2019s largest shareholder is Objektif Bersatu Sdn Bhd \\u2014 a private vehicle of business tycoon T Ananda Krishnan \\u2014 with 42.25%. The Employees Provident Fund is next with 8.43%.

While the competitive environment has led to a slide in MMHE\\u2019s net profit since its listing in 2011, managing director and chief executive Dominique de Soras believes that in the long run, it will help transform the group into a competitive engineering and fabrication outfit in the region. \\u201cYou need to introduce a little bit of fair competition, not only to give a chance to everybody but also to ensure that the people will perform and improve their performances. When MMHE was closely held by Petronas, the group was not challenged enough to push it to become more efficient. \\u201cThis competition has been the driver to push us forward. We may have a bit of a hard time now but I hope in the long run, it will help MMHE become better, more competitive, and able to tackle different jobs and cater for international customers,\\u201d de Soras says in an exclusive interview with The Edge. Petronas has an indirect 66.5% stake in MMHE through MISC Bhd. MMHE\\u2019s net profit for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014, fell 31.6% year on year to RM34.6 million. Its annual earnings have also been declining since its listing. Last year, it registered a net profit of RM236.5 million compared with RM242 million in FY2012 and RM334.2 million in FY2011. Research houses have mixed views on MMHE\\u2019s performance, with five \\u201cbuy\\u201d, six \\u201chold\\u201d and eight \\u201csell\\u201d calls on its stock, according to Bloomberg data. The target prices range from as low as RM3.10 to as high as RM5 per share. The company\\u2019s share price has appreciated 13.65% over the last one year to RM3.90 as at last Friday. Industry observers say MMHE has not been able to live up to its position as the engineering and fabrication yard of the Petronas group. Its order backlog stood at RM2.56 billion as at end-2013, lower than RM3.57 billion at end-2010.According to de Soras, MMHE needs a little bit of time to evolve and adapt to the challenges it faces from a more competitive industry landscape. The group is in the midst of optimising its yard to improve its processes and efficiency. \\u201cIf you look at the cost aspect, some of the structures that we are pricing today are 30% lower compared with two to three years ago. The full cost structure has to be evenly reduced. This is not something you can do in a short time,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt is not just about buying cheaper goods but also procuring more efficiently, and involves all of our subcontractors. Two years ago, a typical project took a minimum of three years, but now SK316 [in Sarawak] has to be ready in under 24 months. \\u201cIt is the result of a lot of work and improvement in our processes and engineering, and our relationship with Technip. This has allowed us to be more efficient along the steps.\\u201d MMHE owns the largest oil and gas engineering and marine fabrication yard in Malaysia, and can accommodate a single structure with a weight of 50,000 tonnes. It has also undertaken some of the most complex engineering jobs of offshore structures ever deployed on Malaysian waters. Some observers say MMHE seems to be biting more than it can chew. The delivery delays of the Gumusut-Kakap semi-submersible floating production system (FPS) is the perfect example of the limitations of the company\\u2019s expertise. MMHE is working on two large offshore structures in its yard in Pasir Gudang, Johor \\u2014 the Malikai tension leg platform and the SK316 Central Processing Platform (CPP) project. Currently, MMHE\\u2019s yard utilisation rate is about 50%. Its jobs were significantly reduced after the completion and delivery of the floating production, storage and offloading unit for Cendor, and the Tapis R topside.  MMHE targets RM5b in revenue While acknowledging that the more competitive environment in the oil and gas engineering and fabrication sector over the last two to three years has led to net margin compression for MMHE, de Soras says the group still enjoys better profitability than its foreign competitors.  \\u201cToday, our net margin is about 7% whereas in 2011, we had a slightly higher net margin of about 10%. This is due to the higher competition in the market as Petronas has opened up some of the big contracts to other local and international competitors. \\u201cHowever, if you look at some of our competitors, such as Hyundai, Daewoo and Samsung of Korea, their margins are even lower \\u2014 about 5%. This business is complex and challenging, and margins are not high,\\u201d he says. Amid the challenging outlook, de Soras is optimistic that MMHE will achieve its targeted RM5 billion annual revenue. However, it has not set a time frame to achieve this revenue target, he says. \\u201cFor me, MMHE should get RM5 billion without an issue and with a steady profit and margin. But the margins will still be about the same. I don\\u2019t think in this business we will see higher margins than around 7%. \\u201cIf I was bullish, I would say by next year we would be able to get RM5 billion in revenue.

While the competitive environment has led to a slide in MMHE\\u2019s net profit since its listing in 2011, managing director and chief executive Dominique de Soras believes that in the long run, it will help transform the group into a competitive engineering and fabrication outfit in the region. \\u201cYou need to introduce a little bit of fair competition, not only to give a chance to everybody but also to ensure that the people will perform and improve their performances. When MMHE was closely held by Petronas, the group was not challenged enough to push it to become more efficient. \\u201cThis competition has been the driver to push us forward. We may have a bit of a hard time now but I hope in the long run, it will help MMHE become better, more competitive, and able to tackle different jobs and cater for international customers,\\u201d de Soras says in an exclusive interview with The Edge. Petronas has an indirect 66.5% stake in MMHE through MISC Bhd. MMHE\\u2019s net profit for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014, fell 31.6% year on year to RM34.6 million. Its annual earnings have also been declining since its listing. Last year, it registered a net profit of RM236.5 million compared with RM242 million in FY2012 and RM334.2 million in FY2011. Research houses have mixed views on MMHE\\u2019s performance, with five \\u201cbuy\\u201d, six \\u201chold\\u201d and eight \\u201csell\\u201d calls on its stock, according to Bloomberg data. The target prices range from as low as RM3.10 to as high as RM5 per share. The company\\u2019s share price has appreciated 13.65% over the last one year to RM3.90 as at last Friday. Industry observers say MMHE has not been able to live up to its position as the engineering and fabrication yard of the Petronas group. Its order backlog stood at RM2.56 billion as at end-2013, lower than RM3.57 billion at end-2010.According to de Soras, MMHE needs a little bit of time to evolve and adapt to the challenges it faces from a more competitive industry landscape. The group is in the midst of optimising its yard to improve its processes and efficiency. \\u201cIf you look at the cost aspect, some of the structures that we are pricing today are 30% lower compared with two to three years ago. The full cost structure has to be evenly reduced. This is not something you can do in a short time,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt is not just about buying cheaper goods but also procuring more efficiently, and involves all of our subcontractors. Two years ago, a typical project took a minimum of three years, but now SK316 [in Sarawak] has to be ready in under 24 months. \\u201cIt is the result of a lot of work and improvement in our processes and engineering, and our relationship with Technip. This has allowed us to be more efficient along the steps.\\u201d MMHE owns the largest oil and gas engineering and marine fabrication yard in Malaysia, and can accommodate a single structure with a weight of 50,000 tonnes. It has also undertaken some of the most complex engineering jobs of offshore structures ever deployed on Malaysian waters. Some observers say MMHE seems to be biting more than it can chew. The delivery delays of the Gumusut-Kakap semi-submersible floating production system (FPS) is the perfect example of the limitations of the company\\u2019s expertise. MMHE is working on two large offshore structures in its yard in Pasir Gudang, Johor \\u2014 the Malikai tension leg platform and the SK316 Central Processing Platform (CPP) project. Currently, MMHE\\u2019s yard utilisation rate is about 50%. Its jobs were significantly reduced after the completion and delivery of the floating production, storage and offloading unit for Cendor, and the Tapis R topside.  MMHE targets RM5b in revenue While acknowledging that the more competitive environment in the oil and gas engineering and fabrication sector over the last two to three years has led to net margin compression for MMHE, de Soras says the group still enjoys better profitability than its foreign competitors.  \\u201cToday, our net margin is about 7% whereas in 2011, we had a slightly higher net margin of about 10%. This is due to the higher competition in the market as Petronas has opened up some of the big contracts to other local and international competitors. \\u201cHowever, if you look at some of our competitors, such as Hyundai, Daewoo and Samsung of Korea, their margins are even lower \\u2014 about 5%. This business is complex and challenging, and margins are not high,\\u201d he says. Amid the challenging outlook, de Soras is optimistic that MMHE will achieve its targeted RM5 billion annual revenue. However, it has not set a time frame to achieve this revenue target, he says. \\u201cFor me, MMHE should get RM5 billion without an issue and with a steady profit and margin. But the margins will still be about the same. I don\\u2019t think in this business we will see higher margins than around 7%. \\u201cIf I was bullish, I would say by next year we would be able to get RM5 billion in revenue. However, I have to consider that we still have our work in progress in terms of performance and delivery. I\\u2019m not here to just win orders, but to deliver good results.\\u201d MMHE is bidding for several big projects in Malaysia, both in the upstream and downstream oil and gas sector, including the US$1.5 billion CPP of the integrated Bardegg and Baronia enhanced oil recovery project off Sarawak.

The pipe manufacturer\\u2019s shares rose 16% over one month and another 4% over the week of May 19-25. The stock closed at RM1.01 on May 20 (Tuesday), putting the company\\u2019s market capitalisation at RM569 million. \\u201cBased on our assumption that 5% of the RM89 billion project is for local pipe, valve and fitting players and assuming Pantech commands a 40% share of the domestic market, we think RAPID should help give its trading division additional revenue of RM300 million per annum, that is almost double what it achieved in FY2014,\\u201d RHB Research analyst, Jerry Lee, says in a May 19 note. The company\\u2019s conventional warrants, Pantech-WA, have seen similar interest and risen in tandem with the underlying share. At their close of 51.5 sen on May 20 (Tuesday), the warrants \\u2014 which have a strike price of 60 sen and a conversion ratio of one to one \\u2014 were trading at a 10.4% premium to the mother share. The free detachable warrants were issued as part of a rights issue in December 2010 and expire on Dec 21, 2020. Pantech-WA\\u2019s long tenure, coupled with its low premium to the mother share, serves as a good proxy for the company\\u2019s growth.  Apart from the expected boost from RAPID, Pantech is also expanding via its subsidiary, Nautic Steels (Holdings) Ltd, to provide copper nickel fittings to Brazilian national oil giant, Petrobras. The company is also in the midst of establishing a business relationship with Indonesian national oil company, Pertamina, in Indonesia. \\u201cThe outcome of the tribunal on the anti-dumping duties imposed by the US government on stainless steel pipes from Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, should be known on July 1. Pantech ought to be able to ramp up its stainless steel production [for export] to the US, if the outcome is favourable,\\u201d says RHB Research\\u2019s Lee. The research house has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the stock and a target price of RM1.25. In its financial year 2014 ended February, Pantech posted a net profit of RM55.8 million, which was little changed from FY2013\\u2019s RM56.07 million. This was on the back of a decline in revenue to RM574.94 million, from 635.66 million previously. Revenue was impacted by the trading division registering weaker sales demand from the oil and gas sector, while a fair value gain in the investment and management division helped net profit rise marginally.  According to Bloomberg, Pantech has a historical dividend yield of 1%. Its net asset value stood at 76 sen per share, as at Feb 28.

Based on our assumption that 5% of the RM90 billion project is for local pipe, valve and fitting players, and Pantech commands a 40% local market share in this sector, we think RAPID should give its trading division an additional revenue of RM300 million per annum, which is almost double what it achieved in FY14. We did a sensitivity analysis of its earnings using its trading division as a variable to show the potential upside of oil and gas activities. We are not overly concerned about the dilution impact of irredeemable convertible unsecured loan stocks and warrants as the growth potential remains intact. We continue to like Pantech for its global oil and gas exposure and retain our earnings forecast until more positive developments in the oil and gas sector occur.  AirAsia X BhdTarget price: 79 sen HOLDMAYBANK IB RESEARCH (May 20): AirAsia X\\u2019s1QFY14 core net loss of RM60.3 million was larger than expected. Some noteworthy updates from the management are: i) the Australian sectors continue to struggle and are responsible for the group\\u2019s losses; ii) the move to klia2 has been positive \\u2014 enhanced operational efficiency and customer experience \\u2014 and higher traffic growth is expected; and iii) no new capital injection is envisaged. The airline\\u2019s results continue to be unilaterally linked to its performance in Australia, which is an extremely challenging market at this stage. The operating environment, however, is stabilising and results should be in the positive territory by 3QFY14 onwards. We expect 2QFY14 losses to be bigger than that of 1QFY14 as it is a seasonally weak quarter. \\u00a0 We project AirAsia X to post a core net loss of RM67.1 million in FY14 due to the weaker yield outlook. Our FY15 and FY16 earnings forecasts are cut by 19.3% and 7.9% respectively. We downgrade the stock to a \\u201chold\\u201d. MMC Corp BhdTarget price: RM2.80 MARKET PERFORMKENANGA RESEARCH (May 19): It was reported in various news portals that Petronas\\u2019 subsidiary Pengerang Power Sdn Bhd has awarded the engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning contract for its 1,220mw Pengerang co-generation plant in Johor to a consortium consisting of Siemens AG, Siemens Malaysia and MMC Engineering Services Sdn Bhd. Based on the conservative assumption that the project value is RM6 billion, MMC has a 30% stake in the consortium and the project gives 6% PBT margins, this project would contribute an average of RM27 million per year to MMC\\u2019s net profit until 2017. If our assumptions hold true, we would revise upward MMC\\u2019s earnings forecasts by 3% to 4% for FY14E and FY15E and our target price to RM2.82 from RM2.80. If it is true that MMC\\u2019s portion of the contract is RM1.8 billion; year to date, it has secured RM2.14 billion worth of contracts. Hence, we estimate that MMC\\u2019s total outstanding order book now is RM4.84 billion. Faber Group BhdTarget price: RM3.30 OUTPERFORMPUBLIC INVESTMENT BANK (MAY 20): Faber announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Faber Medi-Serve Sdn Bhd, has entered into a conditional agreement with Konsortium ProHawk Sdn Bhd to provide asset management services for a women and children\\u2019s hospital in Kuala Lumpur.  The contract is estimated to be worth RM1.03 billion for 27 years and is expected to commence once construction of the hospital is completed in the second half of 2016. In light of insufficient financial details, we have made a couple of broad assumptions: PBT margin of 15%, which is in line with that recorded by the group\\u2019s concession business, and fees receivable are evenly distributed over the contract period.  We concede, however, that our valuation may be on the conservative side as we have not taken into account any variation orders that may arise nor any fee revisions. Our estimation is, however, sufficient to demonstrate that the contract is value accretive to the group, and we maintain our \\u201coutperform\\u201d call on Faber, with a target price of RM3.30.  Brahim\\u2019s Holdings BhdTarget price: RM3.13 BUYHONG LEONG INVESTMENT BANK (May 21): We reviewed the potential impact on Brahim\\u2019s earnings arising from the possibility of Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS) filing for bankruptcy and to be taken over by other operators or to cease operations. Assuming a 30% cut in capacity, Brahim\\u2019s bottom line could be hit by 22.5%. However, travellers may opt to fly other airlines, which could be Brahim\\u2019s customers as it also supplies in-flight meals to over 30 other airlines besides MAS. In the worst-case scenario, a 22.5% impact on earnings would reduce our target price to RM2.81. We view the termination of the 25-year concession agreement (with MAS) as unlikely. Should this happen, MAS or the government would need to compensate Brahim\\u2019s at a rate of fair value plus 20% premium. Based on Brahim\\u2019s payment of RM130 million in January 2013 to acquire an additional effective stake of 34.3% (in operating unit Brahim\\u2019s-LSG Sky Chefs Holdings Sdn Bhd), the group will be paid about RM318 million.  Sunsuria Bhd Target price: RM1.98 BUYUOB KAY HIAN (May 20): In line with our expectations, Sunsuria (formerly known as Malaysia Aica Bhd) announced that it had entered into a heads of agreement with companies related to its executive chairman and substantial shareholder, Datuk Ter Leong Yap \\u2014 Sunsuria Development Sdn Bhd, Rentak Nusantara Sdn Bhd and Strata Johan Sdn Bhd \\u2014 to negotiate on the potential acquisition of four assets, that is, three parcels of development land and an ongoing project. We understand that the purchase consideration has yet to be fixed, pending a valuation that is being undertaken by an independent land/project valuer. The acquisition would be funded by the recently approved rights issue.  Some of the key development parcels that would be acquired by Sunsuria include the Xiamen University Township, Sunsuria Medini, Sunsuria 7th Avenue and Suria Hills 2B. The three-for-one rights issue approved by shareholders last week will see Sunsuria raise up to RM356 million. IJM Corp BhdFair value: RM6.75 BUYAMRESEARCH (May 21): We maintain our \\u201cbuy\\u201d recommendation on IJM. Our fair value of RM6.75 per share, based on the SOP methodology, is under review, pending the release of IJM\\u2019s FY14 results ended March 31 on May 27. Based on a filing by Kumpulan Europlus Bhd (KEuro) with Bursa Malaysia, the government has appointed a consortium, comprising KEuro and IJM, as turnkey/engineering and procurement contractor for the West Coast Expressway project. IJM has been appointed the contractor for Sections 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9 of the project, which are worth a total of RM2.8 billion. The second portion \\u2014 Sections 1, 2, 6, 7, 10 and 11 \\u2014 will be awarded on an open tender basis and is worth RM2.2 billion. We believe that IJM stands a good chance in securing a few packages under the second portion as it has the advantage of redeploying some of its equipment from its own work packages.  Other job opportunities may include Kuantan Port expansion Phase 1, RAPID civil works and Menara Warisan. Affin Holdings BhdTarget price: RM4.05 HOLDALLIANCE RESEARCH (May 20): Affin\\u2019s 1QFY14 net profit was 22% of our FY14 estimate. Its net interest margin fell seven basis points q-o-q due to competition, which led to lower net interest income in the quarter. Expenses fell q-o-q mainly due to lower professional fees incurred in 1QFY14.  Affin\\u2019s asset quality remained intact with gross non-performing loan ratio improving to 1.92% from 1.98% in 4QFY13. Loan growth was driven by non-residential property and construction loans. Deposits contracted, dragged by fixed deposits, and this pushed up the loan-to-deposit ratio to 82%. Capital ratios remained strong with CET-1 CAR at 11.8%. Affin\\u2019s acquisition of HwangDBS\\u2019s businesses was completed on April 7. The total purchase consideration of RM1.36 billion was funded by bridging loans while waiting for its rights issue to be completed in June 2014.  Assuming a maximum scenario of a 35% discount to theoretical ex-rights price (TERP), Affin would need to issue 526 million new shares to raise RM1.25 billion.  Malaysian Resources Corp BhdTarget price: RM2.16 BUYMIDF RESEARCH (May 21): MRCB reported 1QFY14 revenue and core profit after tax and minority interests of RM204.6 million and RM12 million respectively. The growth was attributed to higher revenue contribution from property development. The group\\u2019s Ebit and net margin improved to 33.3% and 5.9% respectively. Overall, the earnings came within our expectations but below market consensus\\u2019. The property division achieved operating profit of RM35.1 million in 1QFY14. This was driven by the strong pace of ongoing property developments as they entered advance stages of completion, particularly Lot B and D. This has led the division\\u2019s margin to expand to 23.2%. In contrast, the engineering and construction division\\u2019s operating profit dropped 17% y-o-y in 1QFY14. We opine its lower contribution was due to infancy execution stage for some projects and slow progress in the light rail transit Ampang Line package B extension project. Nonetheless, the division returned to the black with a growth of 125% q-o-q to RM5.4 million. Puncak Niaga Holdings BhdTarget price: RM3.55 ADDAFFIN INVESTMENT BANK (May 19): Bernama reported that Puncak Niaga Sdn Bhd and Syarikat Bekalan Air Selangor Sdn Bhd have accepted the Selangor government\\u2019s offer of RM2.5 billion and RM3.1 billion respectively.  The acceptances, however, are subject to the official agreement of both companies\\u2019 shareholders after their respective EGMs.  With the latest development, the Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water said that the federal government has decided to postpone the enforcement of Section 114 of the Water Services Industry Act. We maintain our \\u201cadd\\u201d rating for Puncak Niaga with an unchanged target price of RM3.55 per share (based on the water asset value of RM2.90 per share and five times forward earnings of its oil and gas division of 65 sen per share). We see limited downside to Puncak Niaga\\u2019s current share price of RM2.98. It remains to be seen if the company would distribute part of the cash proceeds from the disposal of the water concession to shareholders.  UMW Oil & Gas Corp BhdTarget price: RM4.82 UNDER REVIEWTA SECURITIES (May 20): UMW Oil & Gas Corp\\u2019s (UMW-OG) core net profit of RM55 million for 1QFY14 was within our and consensus\\u2019 expectations, accounting for 20% of full-year forecasts. Q-o-q, it was a decent set of results, although the bottom line was dragged by lower utilisation at the Hydraulic Workover Unit segment as GAIT V was not chartered out, lower commission income from agency sales and UMW-OG had recognised mobilisation fees for Naga 2 in 4QFY13.  We understand that UMW-OG is in the process of negotiating for new contracts for Naga 3, Naga 5, Naga 6 and Naga 7. We forecast that full-year contribution from these new contracts may boost FY15 earnings by 50%, far exceeding FY14\\u2019s solid growth of 18%. Results for the upcoming quarters are expected to improve on the back of the maiden contribution from Naga 5, which began its contract with Nido Petroleum Philippines in May 2014; deployment of newbuild rig Naga 6 in September 2014; and contribution from GAIT 3, which began a 2+1 year contract with Petronas Carigali in March 2014. Malaysia Airports Holdings BhdTarget price: RM7.73 HOLDCIMB RESEARCH (May 19): Over the past two weeks, three government leaders have said that the government will no longer support Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS) financially. During the 1QFY14 results conference call, MAS said that it was reviewing its route network with a view of cutting routes that cannot cover variable costs.  In our bear case, we assume that in FY15, MAS will reduce the number of its flights by 20% y-o-y. Our base case is for a 14% cut and our bull case is for a 9% cut.  In the base-case scenario, we expect Malaysia Airports\\u2019 core EPS to fall 11% in FY15 and 9% in FY16, and our target price to fall to RM7.73. Additionally, Malindo Air\\u2019s expansion is also likely to slow down. Another risk to Malaysia Airports is the challenge in estimating its operating cost as the new klia2 terminal is many times the size of the old low-cost carrier terminal.

But then we decided that perhaps it\\u2019s something that we will look into in the future, rather than now,\\u201d said Hassan in an interview with\\u00a0The Edge Financial Daily. \\u201cThe name itself [risk service contract] says it\\u2019s not a bed of roses,\\u201d he added. Rather, Hassan said Bumi Armada will focus on its core competency, that of a floating solutions provider. \\u201cBesides, we are selective because we want to compete on competency, rather than price. We can add tremendous amount of value [to the jobs we procure]. \\u201cOur game is to be selective and create value,\\u201d he added. Bumi Armada can be fastidious with local jobs. Though Hassan said he is keen to partner with Petronas and has done so, Bumi Armada\\u2019s revenue from its Malaysian operations averaged only 22.09% for the past three years. \\u201cWe have operations in 19 countries across five continents. A lot of our revenue comes from Africa, Central Asia, Angola and Brazil,\\u201d he said. Nonetheless, with Malaysia being Bumi Armada\\u2019s backyard, Hassan said the group is a good partner to Petronas and is keen to work with the state-owned giant. \\u201cWe\\u2019re capable and we are financially sound and we can add tremendous value to them. We are keen to work with them,\\u201d he said. Bumi Armada\\u2019s financials for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014 (1QFY14) showed it had a net gearing of 0.86 times, when imputing total borrowings of RM4.55 billion minus cash and cash equivalents worth RM744.22 million. Its total equity stood at RM4.41 billion. Hassan believes that a gearing level of below one times is \\u201cprudent\\u201d. Thus, to partly fund its capital expenditure (capex) in the coming years, Bumi Armada has opted to make a cash call instead. On Monday, the group announced a combination of rights and bonus issues, in which Bumi Armada is seeking to raise up to RM2.25 billion through the former, largely for its capex programme of RM1.76 billion. Hassan said Bumi Armada will undertake a fleet-renewal programme of a \\u201cpremium level\\u201d in order to meet the requirements of the international markets. \\u201cSome of the vessels are getting older. Today, there is a lot of concern on fuel efficiency and carbon emissions. With the fleet renewal, we come into the market with new requirements, which will most likely be high-end vessels. \\u201cIn the North Sea, for example, there is what is called emission control. If you can\\u2019t satisfy a certain level (of emission level), you can\\u2019t even come in. It\\u2019s the same with Australia, the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil. We need to be a part of this,\\u201d said Hassan. Going forward, he sees Bumi Armada operating a smaller fleet, though it will be of the high-end kind. The group plans to purchase five new vessels this year. Currently, there are 52 vessels in its fleet with 12 earmarked for renewal. \\u201cTo service the industry, we want about 60-plus vessels comprising a mix of vessels, instead of just offshore support vessels (OSVs) to give us more leverage in the market,\\u201d said Hassan. A total of RM80 million has been allocated for its OSV division. Meanwhile, the bulk of the capex portion \\u2013 at RM1.4 billion \\u2013 from its proposed one-for-two rights issue proceeds will be used for its floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) segment. In a report dated May 26, 2014, Maybank IB Research said while there is setback at its OSV operations, the proposed rights issue reflects much optimism on its FPSO division. The research house noted that Bumi Armada had submitted four FPSO bids in Ghana, Mexico, Namibia and Indonesia. They are worth US$3 billion (RM9.66 billion) in capex and there are six more bids in the pipeline with capex of US$10 billion. Maybank has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on Bumi Armada at RM3.90, with a target price of RM4.55. This indicates a 25% upside on its closing price of RM3.64 yesterday. Bloomberg data showed the average target price given by analysts is RM4.37, with 12 out of 20 analysts giving the stock a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call.

Under the JV agreement, Malton is bearing the entire development cost while Ho Hup is providing the land \\u2014 carried at only RM55.20 psf in its books \\u2014 and is entitled to 18% of the project\\u2019s gross development value (GDV) of an estimated RM4.2 billion. Malton, which is controlled by tycoon Datuk Desmond Lim, has yet to officially launch \\u201cPavilion 2\\u201d, much less name it, but Wong says launches have been planned for the end of the year.  In fact, Malton held a preview of the shopoffices in March and April, which saw encouraging response. The first of six blocks of serviced apartments will be launched in the third or fourth quarter.  \\u201cPavilion 2\\u201d comprises shopoffices, offices, a hotel, six blocks of high-rise serviced apartments and a retail mall the size of which could rival Mid Valley Megamall\\u2019s with two million sq ft of net lettable area. The mall, in which Ho Hup will hold 18% equity interest for recurring income, is not for sale.  \\u201cThe launch by Malton will be successful. This JV project will give constant recurring income to Ho Hup for the next 8 to 10 years,\\u201d says Wong. In fact, \\u201cPavilion 2\\u201d is the jewel in Ho Hup\\u2019s crown. Three to four years ago, its GDV was said to be only RM2.1 billion, but now, thanks to Malton\\u2019s plan for a huge mall, it has doubled, increasing Ho Hup\\u2019s share of the project to RM756 million. Reflecting the bright prospects for \\u201cPavilion 2\\u201d, Ho Hup\\u2019s total market capitalisation last Thursday \\u2014 comprising the market value of its shares of RM328.5 million (the stock closed at RM1.43), irredeemable convertible preference shares of RM95.2 million and redeemable convertible preference shares of RM75 million \\u2014 stood at RM499 million. Ho Hup also has 51 million warrants outstanding with an exercise price of 60 sen each. They closed at RM1.08 last Thursday. Nevertheless, Wong says Ho Hup has more to offer than \\u201cPavilion 2\\u201d \\u2014 the company is developing 10 acres in Bukit Jalil that are adjacent to \\u201cPavilion 2\\u201d that do not come under the JV with Malton. The GDV for this project could be over RM1 billion. Thus far, Ho Hup has launched projects with a GDV of close to RM400 million, comprising shopoffices, small offices/versatile offices and super corner retail floors with an unbilled amount of RM317.5 million as at the end of April. The launch of a few more blocks of high-rises is also in the works. Initial development of the 10 acres has contributed to Ho Hup\\u2019s profits even before it has recognised any revenue from its JV with Malton.  In the first quarter ended March 31, 2014, Ho Hup posted a net profit of RM11.31 million or 6.66 sen a share on revenue of RM82.42 million. Property development contributed RM13.03 million to operating profit, construction RM727,000 and ready mixed concrete RM139,000. Wong says the current property market climate is difficult for developers, not because there are no buyers, but because the banks are being very strict with their financing requirements. However, cancellations have been replaced with new bookings, proving that the 10-acre project is doing well, he reckons.  \\u201cProperty development is Ho Hup\\u2019s core business going forward. Cash flow from it will be used for future landbanking and working capital for our construction division.\\u201d  Ho Hup is also planning to expand its portfolio of construction jobs, which now comprise largely infrastructure contracts in Iraq and an integrated army complex in Johor. As at April 30, the division\\u2019s order book stood at RM591.2 million with an unbilled amount of RM469.9 million. The company has also bid for a RM300 million water treatment plant deal in Malaysia and RM3.6 billion worth of jobs overseas. According to Wong, Ho Hup\\u2019s new business model in construction revolves around JVs and partnerships. \\u201cAs the company is stable now, we are being invited to bid for some very interesting projects because of our past track record. [Ho Hup had participated in major projects like the North-South Expressway and the Petronas Twin Towers.]  \\u201cWe haven\\u2019t had any big breakthroughs yet, but we are gearing up and going for key government infrastructure jobs that we would love to be involved in,\\u201d he says, citing opportunities in Pengerang, MRT Line 2 and 3, and hydroelectric dam projects in Sarawak.  In fact, Ho Hup has formed a consortium with international players to bid for a hydroelectric dam project in the Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy. The bid is still in the pre-qualification stage.  \\u201cAs long as we target government-related infrastructure jobs, there is no issue of financing [from banks],\\u201d says Wong.  Wong: The launch by Malton will be successful. This JV project will give constant recurring income to Ho Hup for the next 8 to 10 years. On the company\\u2019s chances of getting the jobs it has bid for, he says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not easy. If we get them, it\\u2019s a bonus. If we don\\u2019t get them, we still have Iraq, where we are hopeful of getting about US$100 million worth of contracts per year.\\u201d  On the ready mixed concrete division, Wong says the company will continue to operate the business, although its profit contribution is small. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a business we won\\u2019t let go because it\\u2019s very sentimental to us, having been a source of cash flow in our bad times.\\u201d In fact, in absolute amounts (revenue), the company intends to grow this segment.

Year-on-year bottom line growth was boosted by a higher crude palm oil average selling price (CPO ASP) of RM2,681 per tonne and increased fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production, which more than offset its relatively higher cost of production. About 4,500ha of its new estates reached maturity only this year and, therefore, had low FFB yields. We maintain our earnings forecasts as we expect stronger quarterly profits. Our 2014 net profit growth forecast (up 56% y-o-y) will be largely driven by a higher CPO ASP of RM2,600 per tonne and increased FFB output. In the medium term, we remain optimistic about SOP\\u2019s prospects premised on a projected 12% three-year FFB output CAGR and the unlocking of value of its oil palm estates near Miri via property development over the next three to five years. Tropicana Corp BhdFair value: RM1.74 HOLDUOB KAY HIAN RESEARCH (May 12): Tropicana\\u2019s 1Q14 results were below expectations mainly because most of its projects that are currently billed are still in the early stages of construction. However, we expect subsequent quarters to record positive earnings growth. This quarter, the company managed to register RM395 million in sales. It is maintaining its 2014 sales target of RM2 billion, backed by launches worth RM3 billion and unbilled sales of RM2.4 billion.  This year, about 40% of its new products will consist of landed residential properties. One of the proposed launches is the Tropicana Aman (Canal City) development, which will feature about RM770 million worth of landed homes.  We believe this development will enjoy a good take-up rate, given its affordable price of RM750,000 per unit, based on our estimates. We reduce our 2014 and 2015 forecasts by 12% and 11% respectively to reflect the shrinking margins for certain developments after the recent rise in construction material cost.  Malayan Banking BhdFair value: RM9.80 HOLDAMRESEARCH (May 14): We maintain our \\u201chold\\u201d rating on Malayan Banking (Maybank) with an unchanged fair value of RM9.80 per share. We have highlighted in a recent report that there may be changes to the banking level common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio if Maybank is required to locally incorporate its operations in Singapore. Our new sensitivity analysis shows that the banking level CET1 ratio will be at 8.27% by 2018, assuming it incorporates its operations in the republic.  This is above the minimum required CET1 ratio of 7% by 2019, but the minimum CET1 ratio has not included any additional requirements for possibly counter-cyclical buffer ahead and possible domestic systematically important financial institutions buffer. Assuming a comfortable banking CET1 ratio of 10%, we estimate an additional RM4 billion in fresh capital will be required. Our sensitivity analysis shows that if a capital raising exercise is done via a rights issue, this may involve an issue on a 1-right-for-every-17-shares basis, at a potential price of RM7.60 (about 20% discount to current market price). TH Plantations BhdTarget price: RM2.38 BUYBIMB SECURITIES RESEARCH (May 12): We recently visited THP Saribas Sdn Bhd in Pusa, Sarawak, together with a group of analysts and fund managers. We returned with a positive view of the company, given that Sarawak estates, as a growth catalyst, may improve TH Plantations\\u2019 earnings moving forward. Following the acquisitions in 2012 and early 2013, Sarawak estates have turned out to be the company\\u2019s biggest fresh fruit bunch contributor in FY13, accounting for 43% of total production (peninsula \\u2014 33%, and Sabah \\u2014 24%). We maintain our earnings forecast with a \\u201cbuy\\u201d recommendation and target price of RM2.38. We are optimistic about TH Plantations\\u2019 future earnings because of its long-term prospects, given its key growth notes: 1) value enhancement of an enlarged plantation platform; 2) landbank expansion; and 3) humanising business operations is on track and starting to bear fruit. Hence, we maintain our FY14 and FY15 estimates. Our target price is premised on our FY14 Ebitda per share estimate of 23.8 sen and a PER of 10 times. Berjaya Sports Toto BhdFair value: RM4.40 HOLDAMRESEARCH (May 14): Berjaya Sports Toto (BST) and Berjaya Corp Bhd\\u2019s unit has been selected to install equipment and operate a computerised lottery system in Vietnam in cooperation with Vietnam Lottery Co. The unit, Berjaya Gia Thinh Investment Technology Co Ltd, is owned by Berjaya Lottery Vietnam Ltd (51%) and a Vietnamese partner (49%).  Berjaya Lottery Vietnam is owned by Berjaya Corp (80%) and BST (20%). We are marginally positive about this. Although we do not expect the venture to contribute significantly to BST\\u2019s bottom line as it will only have an effective stake of 10.2%, the venture will help cushion any decline in earnings from the Philippines if the gaming concession there is not renewed. Berjaya Philippines\\u2019 gaming concession is expected to expire in August 2015. Assuming Berjaya Gia Thinh receives 5% of net sales, we estimate BST\\u2019s share of the revenue to be less than RM10 million per year. We have also assumed that the tax structure in Vietnam is the same as Malaysia\\u2019s. KLCC Stapled Group Target price: RM6.55 MARKET PERFORMKENANGA RESEARCH (May 12): The group has obtained its shareholders\\u2019 approval at the recent annual general meeting for placement of up to 10%, which should raise funds of between RM1.1 billion and RM1.2 billion. It was reported in the media that the funds will be used for potential asset acquisitions within KL\\u2019s Golden Triangle (GT). The potential assets are: (i) the remaining stake of Suria KLCC not already owned (owns only 60% currently); (ii) those under the parent, (KL Convention Centre, Traders Hotel and Impiana Hotel); and (iii) third-party assets within the GT. We raise FY14 to FY15 development, research and innovation by 0.7% to 1.2% as the group is refinancing a significant portion of its debt, which will result in lower financing rates. We believe investors may hold on to the stock in anticipation of new asset acquisitions. However, other MREITs under our coverage provide higher gross yields of 6.3% to 6.5% versus KLCC Stapled Group and thus, we believe the upside potential may be capped until the asset acquisition takes place. Guinness Anchor BhdTarget price: RM13.20 HOLDMAYBANK IB RESEARCH (May 12): Guinness Anchor\\u2019s (GAB) group revenue declined 5.3% y-o-y in 9MFY14 to RM1.2 billion, dragged down by a weaker-than-expected third quarter. Revenue in 3QFY14 fell 16% y-o-y due to weak consumption and the earlier Chinese New Year in 2014. We forecast a 3% contraction in MLM volume for 2014 and a slightly slower growth of 0.5% to 1% for 2015 and 2016. The inflationary pressure on consumers\\u2019 pockets will: (i) curb spending on discretionary items; (ii) encourage the growth in contraband beers; and (iii) promote down trading from premium to mainstream beer. In the meantime, GAB will continue to spend on advertising and promotions to drive sales and defend its share (currently estimated at 58%) in the beer market. We lower our earnings forecasts by 8% to 12% for FY14 to FY16 and our discounted cash flow-based target price to RM13.20. Providing support to share price is the still decent dividend yield of 4.5% (FY14) that GAB offers, almost in line with the \\u20131 SD of its long-term average yield of 4.7%. MISC BhdTarget price: RM6.87 MARKET PERFORMKENANGA RESEARCH (May 12): MISC\\u2019s 1QFY14 core net profit of RM486.4 million was within expectations, making up 29% of our FY14 full-year estimates and 28.7% of market consensus. However, it slid 3.3% q-o-q, despite a 6.9% improvement in revenue, mainly due to tax differentials where MISC enjoyed a tax incentive in 4QFY13 while tax expenses were incurred in 1QFY14. Overall, its petroleum segment has improved, returning to the black in 1QFY14, but rates have retraced significantly recently, and we expect this segment to slip into the red again in the coming quarters. However, we believe losses will narrow on a year-on-year basis. The chemical tanker segment is expected to be fairly stable in 2014, but we expect to see more vessel disposals in the coming years, given the management\\u2019s plan to rationalise its fleet. With five Puteri-class liquefied natural gas (LNG) vessels going out of charter in the next three years and significantly higher vessel deliveries in 2014, we expect the LNG segment to be lacklustre as rates are coming under pressure. Daibochi Plastic and Packaging Industry BhdTarget price: RM4.38 HOLDCIMB RESEARCH (May 13): While Daibochi\\u2019s 1QFY14 revenue rose 23.2% y-o-y, its net profit fell 7%, mainly due to higher raw material and electricity costs during the quarter. The average crude oil price also increased 10% q-o-q in 1QFY14. Therefore, Daibochi had to absorb part of the higher cost. However, as the company\\u2019s selling prices are revised quarterly with its major multinational corporation (MNC) customers (70% turnover), its 2QFY14 profit margin should recover if the raw material prices stabilise in the current quarter.  Continued rise in the raw material cost in 2QFY14 will be negative for the company. Daibochi has started using energy-saving devices and will be able to cut its electricity cost by 50%.  Demand for the company\\u2019s products remains strong, particularly in foreign markets. It started commercial production for a global MNC food and beverage player in 3QFY13 and is likely to see more orders from this customer in the next few months. TRC Synergy Bhd Target price: 56 sen SELLTA SECURITIES (May 9): While we expect TRC Synergy\\u2019s construction division to continue to operate in a challenging environment, we see a silver lining in its mixed-use development project in Ara Damansara, which has a gross development value (GDV) of RM900 million to RM1 billion. When the proposed development begins, it can provide a significant earnings boost to the group and thus, warrant a re-rating of the stock. Recall that TRC Synergy had entered into a joint land development agreement with Syarikat Prasarana Negara Bhd for a mixed-use development (previously estimated GDV of RM687.6 million) in the areas surrounding Station 2 of the Kelana Jaya Line Extension Project. With the selling prices of residential properties in the vicinity ranging from RM600 to RM750 psf, we believe TRC Synergy can afford to price its units at the higher range because it will be a project that will integrate with the proposed LRT station. We expect the project to provide a strong earnings boost to TRC Synergy, given the large-scale development relative to its current share base. Unisem (M) BhdTarget price: RM1.15 SELLTA SECURITIES (May 9): Unisem reported 1QFY14 earnings of RM9.3 million, which was within our estimates, but above consensus\\u2019 at 18.7% and 30.2% respectively. We deem the results within estimates due to the impact of a seasonally weak first quarter. Management expects the company\\u2019s performance to improve going into FY14. This will be spearheaded by previous measures to contain costs and a realignment of its business model. As part of its exercise, FY14 should see savings of about RM800,000 per month from the voluntary separation scheme at PT Unisem and plant closure of Unisem Europe. Additionally, sentiment should also be boosted by solid sales data in the semiconductor sector. Rolling forward our estimates to FY15, we raise our target price to RM1.15 per share from RM1 previously. This is based on an unchanged PER of 14 times against FY15 EPS of 8.2 sen. We believe benefits from the group\\u2019s restructuring exercise have already been priced in. Hence, we maintain our \\u201csell\\u201d recommendation on Unisem. Perisai Petroleum Teknologi BhdTarget price: RM2 BUYUOB KAY HIAN RESEARCH (May 9): Perisai Petroleum Teknologi has secured a letter of award from Petronas Carigali on April 24 to provide its first jack-up drilling rig, Perisai Pacific 101, for three years. This reaffirms our investment thesis on Petronas\\u2019 asset localisation policy. Perisai will leverage Hercules Offshore\\u2019s expertise to operate and maintain the rig. We are encouraged by the fact that the contract is for three years, thus lifting Perisai\\u2019s earnings visibility. We were anticipating a two-year contract at best, so the award came in above our expectation. While no contract values were announced, we believe the charter rates should not be far off the daily charter rates (DCR) of US$140,000 to US$150,000 per day given by Petronas Carigali in recent contracts. We expect Perisai\\u2019s second jack-up rig to enhance our 2015 net profit forecast by RM19 million (assuming DCR of US$150,000 per day for six months). This will prompt a further re-rating for the stock.

In a statement, Petronas said its subsidiary, Pengerang Power Sdn Bhd, has awarded the EPCC job to a consortium comprising Siemens AG, Siemens Malaysia and MMC Engineering for its Pengerang Co-generation Plant (PCP) project in Johor. The contract requires the consortium to undertake the design, engineering, procurement, development and commissioning works and warranty for the project. The plant\\u2019s first co-generation unit is expected to be commercially operational by mid-2017. The PCP is one of the six associated facilities to be developed within Petronas\\u2019 Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) project in Pengerang. Once completed, the PCP will be able to produce 1,220mw of power to supply steam of up to 1,480 tonnes per hour to PIC. TH Heavy Engineering Bhd has received a letter of award from JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration (Malaysia) Ltd to supply a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel for the Layang Development Project in Sarawak. Under the contract, TH Heavy will be responsible for the provision of engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning and leasing of the Deep Producer 1 FPSO until Nov 17, 2023. The contract has extension options for the lease of the FPSO facilities of one year, up to a maximum of 10 years from Nov 18, 2023. The contract is valued at RM1.2 billion for the primary period, with an additional potential of up to RM1.47 billion should the \\u201cfull extension options\\u201d be exercised. \\u201cThe award is expected to contribute positively towards the earnings and net assets per share of the company for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2014 and thereafter,\\u201d said TH Heavy. Theta Edge Bhd\\u2019s wholly-owned unit, Konsortium Jaya Sdn Bhd, has won a RM22.8 million contract from Jabatan Akauntan Negara for the development of the Sistem Perakaunan Akruan Kerajaan Negeri. Konsortium Jaya will be appointed as a system integrator for the development of the accrual accounting system for state treasuries. The project is for 36 months from May 1 to April 30, 2017. \\u201cThe project is expected to contribute positively to the future consolidated earnings of the company,\\u201d said Theta, an information and communications technology service provider. Delloyd Ventures Bhd has received a privatisation offer from major shareholder Chung &\\u00a0Tee Ventures Sdn Bhd. The privatisation will be done via a proposed selective capital reduction and repayment exercise. The automotive and oil palm plantation company said Chung &\\u00a0Tee, which already owns 34.24% in the firm, intends to privatise the company with the help of persons acting in concert with the acquirer. Chung & Tee and persons acting in concert own a collective 63.58% in Delloyd. Under the deal, minority shareholders will receive a capital repayment of RM4.80 a share. Delloyd said the acquirer plans to privatise the firm after taking into account challenges in the auto and oil palm plantation segments. Trading of Delloyd shares was suspended last Thursday. Prior to the suspension, the stock changed hands at RM4.35. The stock will resume trading today. Techfast Holdings Bhd has received a takeover offer from major shareholder Wong SK Holdings Sdn Bhd for 26 sen a share. Techfast, which manufactures computer and telecomunication components, said Wong SK already owns 22.1 million shares or 14.45% in Techfast. Datuk Wong Shee Kai is said to be the ultimate offeror for the exercise as he is the controlling shareholder in Wong SK. Techfast said the acquirer intends to maintain the listing status of the company. Wong SK had emerged a major shareholder in Techfast on April 30 this year. On that day, it bought a 12.3% stake in the latter on the open market. Techfast\\u2019s share price rose four sen to 25 sen at market close last Friday.

The sharp y-o-y growth was mainly due to a base effect as the regasification plant was not yet operational in 1Q13. Processing revenue continued to stay low due to depressed fees for liquid by-products. Under the new Gas Processing and Transportation Agreement (GPTA), Petgas\\u2019 fees for liquid by-products will no longer be subjected to market forces. The first quarter of the year is the last under the previous GPTA. The new GPTA came into force on April 1 and is marginally earnings accretive from the previous one.  In addition, a larger portion of Petgas\\u2019 revenue will now be fixed. We do not expect a re-rating of the stock from current levels due to a lack of fresh catalysts. Valuations are not compelling, but the stock is still appealing to funds seeking earnings stability. Our earnings forecast and target price of RM23.50 remain.  Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd Target price: RM3.94 BUYMAYBANK IB RESEARCH (May 8): The group\\u2019s 1QFY14 net profit of RM35 million equates to 20% of our full-year forecast, which is in line, considering the seasonal impact. The y-o-y decline was largely due to lower Ebit contributions from its offshore division and marine business unit, which fell 39% each to RM22 million and RM8 million respectively. Several new projects were still in their early stages, which did not meet the milestone billings.  Order backlog stood at RM2.3 billion as at March 31, 2014. Replenishment is likely to be back-loaded as jobs are rolled out. We expect RM2.5 billion to RM3 billion worth of job wins for 2014, based on its RM4 billion to RM5 billion tender book (50% international), verses RM2.6 billion in 2013.  The group is heading in the right direction to be regionally competitive. While still reliant on domestic works, plans are in place to break into overseas markets.  Maintain \\u201cbuy\\u201d and target price of RM4.20, pegged to 20 times FY15 PER.  Padini Holdings BhdTarget price: RM2.26 BUYMIDF RESEARCH (May 6): Brands Outlet (BO) stores recorded a commendable same store sales growth of more than 30% y-o-y for 2QFY14 (FY14 ending June 30). Management has indicated that it will focus on expanding its BO stores \\u2014 24 to date \\u2014 as Padini\\u2019s other stores are expected to see relatively flat growth. We believe higher revenue contributions from BO stores will boost Padini\\u2019s overall topline growth. Generic brands offered at BO stores allow Padini greater flexibility in controlling its product mix to cater for the different consumer preference in different areas and maintaining its margins. Management has guided that Padini is keen to expand its network outside the Klang Valley via BO stores. To date, Padini has paid a total dividend of nine sen per share for FY14 and is well on track to pay a full-year dividend of 11.5 sen, giving a net dividend yield of 5.8% at current price. We expect the company to maintain its dividend payout (62% in FY13) as it has cash of RM212.9 million or 32 sen per share.  Hartalega Holdings BhdTarget price: RM7.48 OUTPERFORMKENANGA RESEARCH (May 7): Hartalega\\u2019s 4QFY14 (FY14 ended March 31) revenue rose 4% q-o-q due to higher sales volume in the nitrile glove segment (+5%), which accounted for 91% of the group\\u2019s sales. The average selling price of nitrile gloves was flat during the period.  However, pre-tax profit margin in 4QFY14 fell to 25.1% from 27.9% in 3QFY14 due to cost pressures emanating from higher plant maintenance cost, electricity tariff, consumables and labour cost (hiring ahead of 4Q14 due to the commissioning of the next generation integrated glove manufacturing complex).  Higher sales of latex-based gloves, which currently account for 10%, compared to 5% previously, also contributed to the lower margins. Consequently, 4QFY14 net profit fell 21% to RM49.2 million, dragged down by a higher effective tax rate of 29%, compared to 22% in 3QFY14. The stock is trading at undemanding valuations of 16 times and 15 times on forward 2015 and 2016 EPS respectively, compared with an average net profit growth of 12% per annum. Mudajaya Group BhdTarget price: RM3.62 BUY ALLIANCE RESEARCH (May 6): Mudajaya announced that it has signed an MoU with PT Indomuda Satria Internusa to acquire the latter\\u2019s 70% stake in PT Harmoni Energy Indonesia (PT HEI) for US$5.8 million (RM18.5 million). PT HEI is building a 2x7mw coal-fired plant on a build-operate-transfer concept in Desa Baruta Analalaki, Sulawesi, Indonesia. It also has a power purchase agreement signed for the said plant, whereby the rate for years 1 to 8 is US$0.118487/kWh and for years 9 to 25 is US$0.09384/kWh. This proposed acquisition is relatively small for Mudajaya and can be easily satisfied via its RM67.5 million cash balance. Furthermore, its recently approved RM1 billon sukuk programme can also help fund this acquisition. Post-acquisition, Mudajaya\\u2019s effective generation capacity is expected to rise from 374.4mw to 384.2mw. Our forecast assumes that there will be contribution from its Chhattisgarh power plant by mid-2014, but management has guided that this could be delayed until year-end. Favelle Favco BhdFair value: RM3.70 NEUTRALRHB RESEARCH (May 7): Favelle Favco announced that its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Favelle Favco Cranes Pte Ltd, Favelle Favco Cranes Pty Ltd and Favelle Favco Cranes (M) Sdn Bhd, have secured nine new offshore crane orders worth RM98 million. Eight of the cranes are meant for offshore use. Two cranes, including a tower crane meant for onshore construction use, are scheduled for delivery between 2QFY14 and 4QFY14, and six by FY15.  We believe Favelle Favco has contracts to deliver RM756.2 million worth of cranes between FY14 and FY16. About 62% of the orders (RM467.6 million) is expected to be delivered in FY14, 32.3% (RM244.5 million) in FY15 and the rest in FY16. We note that its year-to-date order book stands at RM186 million. We keep our FY14 and FY15 earnings forecasts unchanged as the new crane orders are still within our estimates. Our fair value of RM3.70 is based on target FY14 PER of 11 times, which is on a par with those of its oil and gas small to mid-cap peers within our coverage.  Benalec Holdings BhdFair value: RM1.31 BUYAMRESEARCH (May 6): Benalec announced that the group\\u2019s wholly-owned unit, Benalec Sdn Bhd, has secured a RM204 million contract (excluding rock revetment works) from the Oriental group in Malacca. Based on a conservative margin of 15% and assuming equal contributions over the next two financial years, we estimate that this new contract will make up 23% and 13% of our FY15F and FY16F net profit forecast respectively. We leave our earnings forecast unchanged for now. Beyond Malacca, Benalec is keeping a close eye on other prospective reclamation contracts to replenish its order book. Tenders for reclamation works under Phase 1 of Eastern & Oriental Bhd\\u2019s STP2 project in Penang (384 acres), potentially worth over RM1 billion, could be called once regulatory approvals are received by 1H2014.  Benalec\\u2019s key re-rating projects still hinge on its ability to monetise the deep development potential of its concessions in Johor. We gather that efforts to obtain regulatory approvals are gaining traction, with newsflow likely to come by end-2H2014. Mah Sing Group BhdTarget price: RM3.03 ADDCIMB RESEARCH (May 4): From April 22 to May 1, we took Mah Sing\\u2019s management on a non-deal roadshow (NDR) to meet European and American investors. We sensed a great change in the European investors\\u2019 level of interest and knowledge compared with our trip in July 2013. However, Mah Sing was new to many American investors and more time was needed for introduction.  There are no changes to our earnings forecast, \\u201cadd\\u201d recommendation and target price basis of parity with RNAV. The re-rating catalysts include: 1) stronger familiarity and comfort arising from the NDR; 2) continuing robust sales and brisk earnings growth; and 3) aggressive landbanking efforts. Mah Sing remains our top pick in the property sector. Investors should continue to accumulate positions in Mah Sing as a proxy to the property sector. Among the larger-cap developers, Mah Sing provides investors with a unique proposition as a pure Malaysian property developer, with exposure to the major property markets. Hock Seng Lee BhdTarget price: RM2.18 BUYHLIB RESEARCH (May 6): The Kumpulan Nishimatsu-Hock Seng Lee (KNH) consortium is in the final stages of negotiation with Sarawak authorities on the Kuching centralised wastewater management system project package 2 contract. As a turnkey contractor, KNH is currently at the tail end of completing the RM530 million package 1.  Given that Hock Seng Lee\\u2019s newly secured order for the year of RM129 million is 21.5% of our FY14 order book replenishment assumption of RM600 million, additional contracts secured will be positive towards reaching our assumption.  We remain positive about the company securing more contracts, given its niche in Sarawak as well as its expertise in marine engineering and mass reclamation. However, we are maintaining our earnings forecasts for now, pending actual awards. Our target price is based on 12 times FY15 earnings. Dialog Group BhdTarget price: RM3.92 MARKET PERFORMKENANGA RESEARCH (May 7): Dialog has proposed a one-for-one bonus issue and a one-for-125 special share dividend. This is a positive proposal as it improves the stock\\u2019s trading liquidity and rewards shareholders. Moreover, the enlarged share capital will better reflect Dialog\\u2019s current scale of operations, business growth and earnings as well as increase the capital base (share capital over market capitalisation) to above 5% from the current 2.8%. The proposed special share dividend will be distributed to entitled shareholders before the proposed bonus issue. Assuming the maximum scenario, the proposed special share dividend and bonus issue will involve up to 236.5 million and 2.67 billion new shares respectively. It will also result in a 54.9% dilution to FY15 to FY16 EPS.  We maintain our earnings forecasts for now, pending the completion of the corporate exercises. We downgrade our call to \\u201cmarket perform\\u201d, given the limited upside from its current share price. \\u00a0 Malaysian Airline System BhdTarget price: 13 sen SELLTA SECURITIES (May 7): We had a meeting with the management of Malaysian Airline System (MAS). Without earnings guidance, the management concurred with our view that 2014 will be a year of extensive damage control due to the tragic Flight MH370 incident. We are worried about the hidden risks associated with the missing flight and the substantial cost involved in the search operations. There are no changes to our FY14/16 earnings projections. In our forecast, we have factored in the possible loss of income from China tourists by lowering the load factor. As far as other financial damages such as litigation claims, damage of aircraft and the cost involved in the search operations are concerned, we give the benefit of doubt that all these will be fully borne by the insurance companies as guided by management. Our concerns over the earnings risks and intensifying competition justify our view that MAS\\u2019s valuation should be, at best, at par with its peers, if not lower. Therefore, we maintain our target price of 13 sen, using one times FY15 book value.Parkson Holdings BhdFair value: RM2.20 SELLAMRESEARCH (May 7): We reaffirm our \\u201csell\\u201d recommendation on Parkson Holdings (PHB), with an unchanged SOP-based fair value of RM2.20 per share. Local dailies reported that PHB plans to build stand-alone shopping malls and lease out the lettable areas to improve margins, given the rental increases for its existing leases.  This move is seen as an alternative source of revenue for PHB. The company\\u2019s cost is said to be 30% lower if it were to build its own malls. PHB is set to build a shopping mall in China, which is slated to open in 1H2015, followed by openings in Cambodia and Malacca in 2017. These malls will be funded by internally generated funds. As at end-1HFY14, PHB was sitting on a cash pile of RM3.4 billion, with a net gearing of 0.4 times.  We are maintaining our EPS estimates for now, pending the release of results of Parkson Retail Asia Ltd (May 8), Parkson Retail Group Ltd (May 15) and PHB (May 22). We believe China\\u2019s earnings will remain vulnerable and challenging.

The revenue growth was largely attributed to: 1) higher loading volume from its LED division; 2) higher production volume for its crystal timing device for major client Epson; and 3) higher contribution from its sensor business. Ebitda margins were stronger at 31.7% versus 29.2% in 1Q13 due to better economies of scale and effective cost management. Headline 1Q14 net profit was up 38.3% to RM14.1 million, mainly due to higher revenue, better margins and lower depreciation charges. The company also declared a total dividend of seven sen per share versus five sen per share in 1Q13.  We believe Globetronics is on track to achieve our 33% EPS growth forecast for FY14. It has indicated that it intends to increase the contribution from its sensor business to between 45% and 50% of group revenue by FY15. We do not rule out the possibility of an earnings upgrade if the other sensor products that Globetronics is currently exploring were to materialise. Alam Maritim Resources BhdTarget price: RM1.96 BUY RHB RESEARCH (April 28): Alam Maritim announced that it had entered into a subscription agreement with Associated Land Sdn Bhd and Caprice Capital International Ltd in relation to the issuance and allotment of 123 million new shares to the two companies. The new shares, representing 15.35% of Alam Maritim\\u2019s existing issued and paid-up share capital, will raise RM166 million. Of the amount raised, 40.5% (RM67.2 million) will be used to finance the acquisition of a new vessel, which we believe would be a diving support vessel (DSV) worth about US$80 million (RM259.8 million). The company is bidding for Petronas\\u2019 inspection, repair and maintenance contracts worth RM2 billion in total that would require the use of a DSV to perform subsea works. About 57.3% (RM95.1 million) of the proceeds will be used to repay bank borrowings, while the rest would be used to cover miscellaneous expenses. We view the transaction favourably as we expect it to cut Alam\\u2019s gross gearing to 0.67 times from 1.07 times. Westports Holdings BhdTarget price: RM2.70 BUY MAYBANK IB RESEARCH (April 29): Westports\\u2019 1Q14 container volume grew 12% y-o-y. The strong volume came from its existing customers along fast-growing routes, such as intra-Asia, Asia-Africa and Asia-Australasia. We expect the strong volume to sustain into 2Q14, potentially registering another robust y-o-y growth rate. This is also partially due to the slower volume in 2Q13 from the holdback of import-export activities in view of the 13th general election. The construction of CT7 (Phase 1) is complete and two quay cranes are expected to be installed by May, indicating new annual capacity of 420,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). Five new quay cranes will be installed by end-2014, raising total new capacity this year by 1.5 million TEUs. In view of the high utilisation port rate of 81% and our expectation of stronger volume ahead, the new capacity is timely. Assuming Westports\\u2019 volume stays at the current level, we estimate that its port utilisation will be at 70% (which is still ideal) upon the full commencement of CT7 by end-2014.Malaysia Airports Holdings BhdTarget price: RM9.80 BUY ALLIANCE RESEARCH (April 28): The soon-to-be-opened klia2 can accommodate up to 45 million passengers per annum, a marked increase from the 15 million passenger capacity of the current low-cost-carrier terminal. With the higher capacity as well as improved amenities and connectivity of klia2, we expect the new airport to support the long-term expansion plan of domestic low-cost carriers, thereby cementing Malaysia\\u2019s position as the largest low-cost carrier hub in the region.  We also view klia2 as catalytic for MAHB\\u2019s KLIA Aeropolis development. Being the first commercial project within KLIA Aeropolis, [email\\u00a0protected], if successful, will draw international developers and investors\\u2019 interest to the proposed development.  MAHB\\u2019s current share price effectively ignores the valuation of its KLIA Aeropolis landbank, which is set to see aggressive developments being rolled out over the next six to seven years. We believe investors should overlook its near-term earnings dilution and accumulate MAHB on any share price weakness. Malaysian Pacific Industries BhdTarget price: RM5 ADD CIMB RESEARCH (April 29): MPI\\u2019s 9MFY14 earnings were above our expectations, accounting for 78% of our full-year estimates. The company posted core 9MFY14 net profit of RM42.7 million compared with a net loss of RM3.1 million in 9MFY13. Despite the seasonal weaker demand in the first calendar quarter, 3QFY14 sales expanded by 12.8% y-o-y, driven by a better product mix. The stronger earnings performance is due to better sales of higher-margin packages and a weaker ringgit. Following the stronger result, we raised FY14 to FY16 profit forecast by 3% to 7%. MPI declared a 10 sen tax-exempt dividend for the quarter, which is above our expectations. We expect a better 4QFY14, driven by a pickup in industry demand. We see the stronger earnings contribution from the smartphone and tablet segment as the key re-rating catalyst for the stock. We raise our target price to RM5. MPI is our top pick for the domestic semiconductor sector. Sime Darby BhdTarget price: RM10 OUTPERFORM KENANGA RESEARCH (April 29): Sime Darby announced it was taking a stake in Verdezyne Inc, a US-based biotechnology company. Verdezyne has proprietary technology to produce chemicals derived from sustainable materials, which can be found in the oil palm value chain. Currently, these chemicals are derived from petroleum-based feedstocks. We are neutral on the news, as we believe the near-term impact to earnings is minimal. Assuming a scenario of 80% utilisation for the 13,000 metric ton (MT) commercial plant, production should only result in 10,400 MT of downstream product for Sime and this is small, at 0.4% of its 2.47 million MT of crude palm oil production in FY13. However, the longer-term impact is positive, as it should result in more demand for palm oil, resulting from Verdezyne\\u2019s research. Sime\\u2019s key earnings driver will still be CPO prices, which we are bullish on. We expect an average CPO price of RM2,800 per MT in CY14. We believe Sime\\u2019s 2H14 earning is likely to be higher than 1H14 due to the high CPO prices currently. Hock Seng Lee BhdTarget price: RM2.30 BUY MAYBANK INVESTMENT RESEARCH (April 30): HSL won infrastructure works at Samalaju Industrial Park in Bintulu from Samado Sdn Bhd worth RM73.7 million. The contract consists of piling, drainage, pavement, sewerage station system and related mechanical and electrical works. The job is expected to be completed by 1Q16. We estimate that this contract has lifted HSL\\u2019s outstanding construction order book by 6% to RM1.27 billion. We forecast a net profit contribution of RM13.3 million into FY16, assuming net profit margin of 18%, which translates into an EPS of 2.2 sen to be recognised in the next three years. HSL will continue to ride on the development in SCORE, particularly the reclamation and infrastructure works. HSL consortium is also vying for Package 2 of the Kuching Centralised Wastewater Management System. Ex-cash and the book value of its property development land of 62 sen per share, HSL is trading at an undemanding valuation of just 6.9 times 12-month forward earnings. Yinson Holdings BhdTarget price: RM10.33 BUY AMRESEARCH (April 29): Yinson has fixed its proposed rights issue price at RM2.20 per share on a one-for-one entitlement basis, slightly lower than our earlier expectation of RM2.30 per share. Based on its last closing price, this represents a 59% discount to its ex-rights price of RM5.43 per share. After the rights and one-to-two share split, we estimate that Yinson\\u2019s basic FY15F EPS of 45 sen will drop to 14.6 sen. Our ex-all diluted SOP will drop from RM10.30 per share to RM3.12 per share. The group\\u2019s net gearing of two times as at end-FY14 will drop to 0.4 times as at end-FY15F \\u2014 significantly lower than Bumi Armada\\u2019s 0.9 times. Yinson will be using 77% of the rights proceeds for debt repayment and working capital purposes. We remain positive on the group, as its lower gearing position allows it to secure up to two projects in 2H14. Despite outperforming the FBM KLCI by 264% over the past year, valuations are still decent at FY15F EV/Ebitda of 9.9 times compared with Bumi Armada\\u2019s 11.5 times. Daya Materials BhdTarget price: 48 sen BUY RHB INVESTMENT RESEARCH (April 29): Daya Materials has entered into a share sale agreement with Perfect Propel Sdn Bhd to dispose of 2.4 million ordinary shares in Daya CMT Sdn Bhd \\u2014 Daya Materials\\u2019 technical services (TS) arm \\u2014 for RM18 million. The proposed sale represents a 30% stake in the subsidiary. Cash proceeds amounting to RM18 million would be mainly used for the group\\u2019s working capital purposes, operating expenses and repayment of trade and other payables. The transaction is slated to be completed by 2QCY14. We view the disposal favourably, as Perfect Propel has substantial experience in the sector. In fact, this is in line with Daya Materials\\u2019 aim to divert more attention and resources to its fledgling upstream O&G venture.  The TS division had been contributing 49% to 55% to PBT between 2009 and 2013 and we believe this is set to change from FY14 as the O&G division starts contributing significantly to the group. Daya Materials\\u2019 earnings are expected to improve by 2QFY14.  Public Bank BhdTarget price: RM17.06 HOLD ALLIANCE RESEARCH (April 30): Public Bank announced a proposed RM5 billion rights issue to strengthen its capital position and build up an adequate level of capital buffer in preparation of the forthcoming regulatory capital requirements. The proposed rights issue will lift its capital ratios by three percentage points (ppt) but dilute return on equity (ROE) by two ppt. With the overhang of capital issuance removed, Public Bank can fully focus on growth without distractions. We also expect dividend payout to stop sliding; we have assumed a sustainable dividend payout of 40%. Keeping this ratio up to FY18F, and assuming stable loan growth of 11%, Common Equity Tier 1 ratio should stay healthy at 8%, above Basel III\\u2019s requirement. With the rights issue completed, Public Bank\\u2019s investors will no longer need to worry about the bank\\u2019s inability to meet Basel III requirements. Post rights, Public Bank\\u2019s ROE \\u2014 estimated at 19% \\u2014 is still the highest among Malaysian banks. Bonia Corp BhdTarget price: RM5.45 ADD AFFIN INVESTMENT RESEARCH (April 28): Bonia announced a one-for-one bonus issue. The entitlement date will be determined later, after a special meeting requiring approval from shareholders. Bonia has also proposed a two-for-one share split, after the bonus issue. Backed by Bonia\\u2019s healthy earnings growth and ample reserves, we are positive on this announcement. Post-completion of the bonus issue as well as share split, Bonia\\u2019s enlarged share base will jump fourfold from 201.6 million shares to 806.3 million shares. Overall, we remain positive on Bonia. We peg the stock at a higher target multiple in view of the corporate exercise, which will boost the stock\\u2019s liquidity. We reckon that Bonia\\u2019s low liquidity has been an impediment to investors\\u2019 seeking to invest in the stock (average six-month volume, 120,000 shares). With an upside potential of 11%, we maintain our \\u201cadd\\u201d recommendation on Bonia. Key risk to our view is a sharp slowdown in regional consumer spending. Tasek Corp BhdTarget price: RM16.44 HOLD CIMB INVESTMENT RESEARCH (April 29): Tasek\\u2019s annualised 1Q14 core net profit formed 100% of our full-year estimate. The results were broadly in line, as we do not expect future quarters to be better, in view of the challenging landscape. The better cement selling prices y-o-y in 1Q, which arrested further margin decline, were expected but are unlikely to be sustainable, as competition is likely to intensify, along with the impact of higher operating costs. The absence of dividends was also expected. Our industry checks show that domestic cement demand is likely to moderate in 2H. This is due to the timing of the implementation of both new building and infrastructure jobs. Following the completion of klia2, other specialised projects such as power plants have yet to take off. The rollout of the RM25 billion MRT 2 project is expected only towards end-2015. Overall cement demand growth could be 4% in 2014 versus 5% to 6% last year. Slower cement demand and domestic oversupply are likely to sustain the competitive landscape.

Lower cost of sales, absence of impairment provision, and higher profit from joint ventures also supported MISC's bottom line even though revenue fell. The shipping company said net profit rose to RM486.4 million from RM300.4 million. Revenue was, however, lower at RM2.29 billion versus RM2.38 billion.

The Edge Weekly in its cover story said that the RM200 billion worth of jobs in the pipeline for the next 20 years had been carrots for investors and driven up valuations. However, as the government nears the end of its fiscal rope and the property market slows down, investors will have to reassess the potential risk of delays in these mega projects, it said. It said that although the short and mid-term fundamentals of most of the construction players are still intact and they have sizeable order books to keep them busy until the end of next year, the problem is that many of the mega-projects in the pipeline would not be awarded anytime soon. Citing Gadang Holdings Bhd major shareholder and managing director Tan Sri Kok Onn, the Edge said that the only major projects that will go ahead this year were those of Petronas in the form of RAPID and RAPID Phase 2. It said the RM60 billion RAPID (Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development) project that falls under the Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex recently received the final investment decision from Petroliam Nasional Bhd and Kok expects several of its packages to be awarded in the next six months, including the co-generation power plant and the infrastructure jobs that Gadang was bidding for. However, the bulk of the RAPID project\\u2019s cost will go to the oil and gas players and equipment suppliers with only a small slice for civil and infrastructure works. Thus, some economists are expecting the construction sector to grow at a slower pace than the consensus forecast of 10% this year, it said. The weekly said infrastructure projects accounted for 20.4% of new construction contracts in 2013, down from an average of 31.4% from 2007 to 2013. Looking ahead, no tenders will be awarded for the massive RM25 billion second Klang Valley Mass Rapid Transit line soon, although the Cabinet approved the project last month, it added. The weekly noted that project manager MRT Corp has said tenders for the rail project will only be called next year after the public display, environmental impact assessment, land acquisitions and fine-tuning of the alignment have been completed. It is highly unlikely that a project this size and with high multiplier value will be scrapped, but a lengthy delay could be costly. Players like Gamuda Bhd and MMC Corp Bhd have invested heavily in 10 tunnel-boring machines for Line One. The equipment makes the MMC-Gamuda partnership a strong contender for the next tunnelling package, but it could mean expensive holding costs if there is no timely deployment of the machines, say industry observers. Following the government\\u2019s cooling measures, the residential property market is expected to see a slowdown. And given that 30% of new contracts came from residential projects last year, any weakening will have a substantial impact on the sector. The weekly also quoted RHB Research Institute\\u2019s chief economist Lim Chee Sing as saying that potential homebuyers were also facing hurdles in securing bank financing with loan rejection rates potentially as high as 30% based on recent reports. As a result, there could be a delay in the rolling- out of several mega property developments planned in the Klang Valley because these are highly dependent on market demand to get off the ground, it said.

The Edge Weekly in its cover story said that the RM200 billion worth of jobs in the pipeline for the next 20 years had been carrots for investors and driven up valuations. However, as the government nears the end of its fiscal rope and the property market slows down, investors will have to reassess the potential risk of delays in these mega projects, it said. It said that although the short and mid-term fundamentals of most of the construction players are still intact and they have sizeable order books to keep them busy until the end of next year, the problem is that many of the mega-projects in the pipeline would not be awarded anytime soon. Citing Gadang Holdings Bhd major shareholder and managing director Tan Sri Kok Onn, the Edge said that the only major projects that will go ahead this year were those of Petronas in the form of RAPID and RAPID Phase 2. It said the RM60 billion RAPID (Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development) project that falls under the Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex recently received the final investment decision from Petroliam Nasional Bhd and Kok expects several of its packages to be awarded in the next six months, including the co-generation power plant and the infrastructure jobs that Gadang was bidding for. However, the bulk of the RAPID project\\u2019s cost will go to the oil and gas players and equipment suppliers with only a small slice for civil and infrastructure works. Thus, some economists are expecting the construction sector to grow at a slower pace than the consensus forecast of 10% this year, it said. The weekly said infrastructure projects accounted for 20.4% of new construction contracts in 2013, down from an average of 31.4% from 2007 to 2013. Looking ahead, no tenders will be awarded for the massive RM25 billion second Klang Valley Mass Rapid Transit line soon, although the Cabinet approved the project last month, it added. The weekly noted that project manager MRT Corp has said tenders for the rail project will only be called next year after the public display, environmental impact assessment, land acquisitions and fine-tuning of the alignment have been completed. It is highly unlikely that a project this size and with high multiplier value will be scrapped, but a lengthy delay could be costly. Players like Gamuda Bhd and MMC Corp Bhd have invested heavily in 10 tunnel-boring machines for Line One. The equipment makes the MMC-Gamuda partnership a strong contender for the next tunnelling package, but it could mean expensive holding costs if there is no timely deployment of the machines, say industry observers. Following the government\\u2019s cooling measures, the residential property market is expected to see a slowdown. And given that 30% of new contracts came from residential projects last year, any weakening will have a substantial impact on the sector. The weekly also quoted RHB Research Institute\\u2019s chief economist Lim Chee Sing as saying that potential homebuyers were also facing hurdles in securing bank financing with loan rejection rates potentially as high as 30% based on recent reports. As a result, there could be a delay in the rolling- out of several mega property developments planned in the Klang Valley because these are highly dependent on market demand to get off the ground, it said. The RM50 billion development by the EPF\\u2019s wholly-owned Kwasa Land Sdn Bhd on the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia\\u2019s (RRIM) 2,330 acres in the heart of the Klang Valley could be the largest to be affected, noted the weekly.

Gross dividend per share of 5.3 sen was declared for 1QFY14, which included an 88 sen non-taxable portion, based on a 99.6% payout.  We do not discount the possibility of an acquisition in the near future as Axis REIT has yet to complete the share placement exercise, of which it will be seeking shareholders\\u2019 approval on April 29 to allot and issue 90,762,819 units, or 19.8% of the existing fund size. Axis REIT is targeting RM380 million to RM400 million worth of asset acquisitions this year. However, we think acquisitions may be challenging due to the current low cap rate environment. We make no changes to our FY14E estimates. Note that our FY14E estimates accounts for the gains on disposal of Axis Plaza, which will be paid in three tranches in FY14, and the loss of income from Axis Plaza starting 1Q14. CIMB Group Holdings BhdTarget price: RM7.75 ADD AFFIN INVESTMENT BANK (April 21): CIMB Thai saw its 1QFY14 net profit rising 40.8% y-o-y to THB440.7 million, driven primarily by more robust top line contribution from non-interest income.  As these gains are deemed non-recurring, we believe the robust earnings will taper off in the coming quarters. Based on our FY14 net profit forecast of RM4.86 billion for CIMB Group, the Thai unit\\u2019s annualised results amounts to a share of about 9% and is ahead of our forecast, which represent close to 8% of the group\\u2019s earnings. Our target price for CIMB Group remains unchanged at RM7.75, based on a FY15E return on equity of 13.6%, a cost of equity of 11.2% and a growth rate of 7%, which translates into a price-to-book value multiple of 1.56 times. At RM7.39, the stock remains undervalued, as implied by FY14E and FY15E P/BVs of 1.6 times and 1.5 times respectively, which are below its seven-year-forward average of 1.9 times. Meanwhile, foreign shareholdings have continued declining and stood at 33.4%. IJM Corp BhdTarget price: RM6.35 NEUTRAL ALLIANCE RESEARCH (April 22): IJM announced that it has been awarded a RM396 million contract for the main building works for a proposed commercial development in Damansara Utama. We estimate that this would boost its external order book from RM1.2 billion to RM1.6 billion. While securing this contract provides IJM with a much needed order book replenishment, we believe it is still insufficient to provide significant earnings visibility for its construction division. Note that order book replenishment has been rather weak over the last two years with no new contracts in FY13 and only RM238 million in FY14.  The key catalyst would be the award of the RM5.9 billion West Coast Expressway, which we understand is slated for award in 2QCY14. IJM is eyeing to secure 70% of the works for WCE, amounting to RM4.1 billion. However, we understand that this will be broken down into smaller packages to be awarded separately rather than as a lump sum contract.  Maintain \\u201cneutral\\u201d with RM6.35 target price based on a 10% discount to its SOP valuation. Perdana Petroleum BhdTarget price: RM2.18\\u00a0BUY HLIB RESEARCH (April 24): Perdana Petroleum Bhd\\u2019s new accommodation barge Perdana Resolute, which was delivered in February, is ready to start work by the end of this month. It is one of the accommodation barge charters for Dayang\\u2019s HUCC contract. To recap, Perdana has won a RM700 million contract for the supply of five work barges and one workboat for five years. Perdana\\u2019s order book stands at around RM1.4 billion now with 82% of its fleet under long-term contracts, which enhances its earnings visibility. The acquisition of three lease vessels and disposal of ageing OSVs will result in total cost savings of RM20 million. There are still four vessels under sale and leaseback arrangements. The acquisition of those vessels in the future will expand margins due to reduced lease expenses. We remain positive on Perdana, given the cyclical upturn in the OSV market based on an increase in offshore O&G work, thanks to Petronas\\u2019 five-year capex budget of RM300 billion. We maintain our \\u201cbuy\\u201d call with an unchanged target price of RM2.18 pegged at an unchanged 14 times FY15 EPS of 15.5 sen. Datasonic Group BhdFair value: RM4.08 BUY RHB RESEARCH (April 21): Datasonic announced to Bursa Malaysia that it has secured a RM220 million order from the National Registration Department for 10 million new MyKads.  On a separate note, Datasonic also announced that it has secured a tenure extension for its outstanding order of four million MyKads. Note that these four million identity cards were supposed to have been delivered by Dec 21, 2013. Nonetheless, management had to carry this forward to 2014 due to capacity constraints. With this extension inked, the group has now agreed to deliver the outstanding four million MyKads by June 30, 2014. We make no major changes to our forecast for now, given that the announcement was largely within our expectations. Our earnings estimates have already captured the contribution from this new contract. All in, we maintain our \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the stock, with our fair value unchanged at RM4.08, based on 25 times CY15F PER. Since our recent recommendation upgrade on April 17, Datasonic\\u2019s share price has surged by over 25%. UMW Oil & Gas Corp BhdTarget price: RM5 ADD CIMB RESEARCH (April 21): The potential early delivery of Naga 7 was a pleasant surprise. Its construction was originally scheduled to be completed in December 2014. This positive development came just a month after we wrote about the early delivery of Naga 5, which will join UMW-OG\\u2019s fleet next week, a month earlier than the original schedule.  The early delivery of Naga 7 could raise our FY14 EPS by 2%. Management is scouting for a second contract for Naga 5 and the first contracts for Naga 6 and Naga 7. It is bidding for 17 contracts \\u2014 six in Malaysia and the rest in other Southeast Asian markets \\u2014 for the three jack-ups, underscoring a high demand for the asset class.  We expect the daily charter rate to normalise at around US$150,000, which is still appealing if the jack-up is put on a long-term charter. Accumulate the stock as UMW-OG embarks on an aggressive fleet expansion to take advantage of the shortage in Malaysian-flagged jack-ups and high demand in Southeast Asia. Public Bank BhdTarget price: RM19.08 HOLD HONG LEONG INVESTMENT BANK (April 22): Public Bank\\u2019s 1QFY14 net profit of RM1,016.9 million only accounted for 23.3% and 22.9% of our and consensus full-year forecasts respectively. Loans growth of 11.3% y-o-y and deposits growth of 11.5% were largely in line with a guidance of 10% to 11%. Although Bank Negara Malaysia has thus far only published industry loans and deposits growth for February while the numbers for March will only be available at end-April, the above numbers do suggest that the group will continue to outpace the industry in terms of loans and deposits growth. On the new Bank Negara regulatory reserves requirement to maintain a minimum of 1.2% collective assessment, Public Bank said that there will be no impact on its earnings as the shortfall will be transferred from its retained earnings. However, as this reserve will be treated as Tier-2 capital and does not qualify as CET1, its CET1 and Tier-2 capital will be reduced and increased by 0.6 percentage points respectively. KPJ Healthcare BhdTarget price: RM3.40 HOLD AMRESEARCH (April 22): Local dailies reported that KPJ Healthcare is investing RM17 million over the next three to five years for the roll-out of a private cloud system to link patients\\u2019 data. This is a positive given that a nationwide cloud infrastructure for managing data would lead to savings of 30% to 40% in hardware costs over five years. The group currently spends RM5 million in each hospital to upgrade the servers\\u2019 hardware. This adds up to RM125 million for 25 hospitals, representing 6% of the group\\u2019s operating cost. That aside, KPJ is in the midst of commissioning its new hospital in Muar, Johor, which is earmarked to open in July. New hospitals may take three to five years to break even. KPJ has seven new hospitals in the pipeline from FY14F to FY16F. Although it is a beneficiary of a growing private healthcare market and an ageing population, we view that its valuation is rich at 32 times FY14F PER. We will turn positive on the stock if its new hospitals turn around earlier than expected. Wing Tai Malaysia BhdTarget price: RM2.25 HOLD HWANGDBS VICKERS RESEARCH (April 23): Wing Tai registered 3QFY14 earnings of RM14.6 million, taking 9MFY14 profit to RM41 million, which constitutes only 55% of our full-year estimate. The weaker-than-expected results were largely due to depressed margins for its retailing business as well as the delay in the launch of the Le Nouvel project. While property development Ebit rose 306% q-o-q to RM17 million due to higher profit recognition from the Verticas Residensi project, the retail business disappointed with only RM5.9 million Ebit as a result of higher operating cost and promotional activities during the quarter.  Meanwhile, profit from associates came in at only RM71,000, which was likely caused by losses from Lanson Place Bukit Ceylon. With construction of Le Nouvel half completed, this could strain Wing Tai\\u2019s balance sheet and limit funds for future landbanking exercises, although net gearing remains healthy at 20%. Its retail sales may be less than inspiring given rising inflationary pressures and more cautious discretionary spending. Tenaga Nasional BhdTarget price: RM14 BUY MAYBANK IB RESEARCH (April 22): We estimate Tenaga\\u2019s core net profit at RM920 million, 19% of our FY14 forecast. This brings 1HFY14 net profit to 45% of our FY14 forecast, in line with Tenaga\\u2019s seasonal trends. The new tariffs would have been effective for two months in the quarter. Generation for the quarter totalled 27,150GWh, with gas and coal accounting for 58% and 35% respectively. Tenaga\\u2019s coal cost should again remain benign, with the Newcastle benchmark having averaged US$81 per tonne in the quarter. Gas consumed averaged at 1,385mmscfd, a consequence of the coal plant outages. We note that there could be a partial offset from lower capacity payments. We continue to be bullish on Tenaga as we believe investors have yet to price in its longer-term earnings growth potential. We value Tenaga using the discounted cash flow methodology, assuming 7.2% weighted average cost of capital and 1% long-term growth. Our target price implies an FY15 price-to-book value of 1.9 times and PER of 14.8 times. Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings BhdTarget price: RM4.30 BUY UOB KAY HIAN (April 21): In a recent meeting with management, MMHE was cautiously optimistic on its order outlook in 2014, with a bid book of RM4 billion to RM5 billion worth of jobs. From an operating standpoint, we believe that margins could recover from 6.7% in 2013 to 8% to 10% in 2014, underpinned by contributions from its Malikai tension leg platform project, contributions from its SK316 project and securing variation orders from its projects including the Cendor project. Management will continue to focus on a few areas: a) project execution, b) removing violators and enhancing performance management, and c) improving culture. We understand that there are more Petronas enhanced oil recovery projects up for grabs, coupled with various central processing platforms. Notable projects being tendered out include Baronia CPP and Nosong wellhead platform off Sabah. These projects will benefit local fabricators in our view and we remain upbeat that MMHE could win some of them, supported by its partnership with Technip and yard availability. Malaysia Airports Holdings BhdTarget price: RM8.50 HOLD AMRESEARCH (April 21): The certificate of completion and compliance for klia2 was finally handed over on April 18 by the main contractors, the UEM-Bina Puri JV, after much delay. We subsequently revise our FY14 to FY16 earnings upwards by 2% to 5% to account for the opening of klia2 in May. Although the confirmed opening date of klia2 will lift the overhang on the stock, we remain cautious on the shorter term, as any incremental start-up costs associated with the commencement of klia2 has yet to be factored in. Valuation remains high at FY14 PER of 26 times, against the historical average of 18 times, as depreciation and interest expense due to the construction of klia2 significantly weighs on its bottom line. However, we believe that this will be addressed upon the extension of the concession period by at least 25 years, which is expected to kick in at the end of the year. Our sensitivity analysis shows that a 25-year extension will raise our FY15 earnings by 42%, implying a FY15 PER of 19 times.

Again, earnings for the full year were dragged down by a weaker 2H \\u2014 net profit grew 9% y-o-y in 1HFY14 but fell 5% y-o-y in 2HFY14. Positively, net profit in 4QFY14 recovered to RM14.6 million, up from RM12.1 million in 3QFY14 \\u2014 despite the slight 2.5% decline in sales. We attribute the better margin to a more favourable product mix.  Better margins on higher value added products For instance, since the US imposed anti-dumping duties on stainless steel pipes, Pantech has shifted production to fittings, which have better margins. Production for the latter has since quadrupled. As a result, although the anti-dumping duties are a setback for the stainless steel plant, it still managed to generate a small profit in FY14 \\u2014 compared to start-up losses in FY13. The stainless steel plant is currently running at roughly 80% capacity. Sales at UK-based Nautic Steel also carry higher margins on value-added niche products like copper nickel and nickel alloy pipes and fittings. The company has also focused on producing higher margin products \\u2014 such as long bends \\u2014 at the carbon steel plant for both local and export markets. Expanding global footprint Notably, Pantech has made good inroads in the export markets. Its products, led by those manufactured by Nautic, are approved by many of the oil majors. Export sales accounted for 49% of total sales in FY14, up from 31% in FY11. Stronger margins and earnings from manufacturing offset lower contributions from the trading arm in FY14. Aside from lower sales, the slow project execution in the domestic oil and gas sector also resulted in a less favourable product mix for Pantech\\u2019s trading unit as it turned to other sectors to make up the slack. Positive longer-term outlook Despite the near-term setback \\u2014 due to reasons mentioned above \\u2014 we remain sanguine on Pantech\\u2019s longer-term growth prospects. The company is cautiously optimistic that project flow in the domestic oil and gas market will regain traction in 2H of 2014 \\u2014 rejuvenated by Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u2019s approval of the final investment decision for the US$26 billion (RM84.8 billion) Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) project.  For instance, Barakah Offshore Petroleum has just won a RM260 million contract to lay gas pipeline to PIC. Work for the contract is to commence immediately. The oil and gas sector remains a key focus area under the Economic Transformation Programme. Petronas is expected to spend over RM300 billion in capital expenditure between 2011 and 2015.  Crude oil prices have been holding steady for the past few years. This will continue to support global oil and gas exploration and production activities. Expanding capacity on expectations of rising demand To cater to expectations of rising demand, including that from the PIC, Pantech is planning to buy more equipment for the carbon steel plant this year. This will raise production capacity to 21,000 tonnes per annum, from the current 18,500 tonnes. The plant is currently running at full capacity. With the new equipment, Pantech can further expand its product range and strengthen its position as the largest one-stop centre for pipes, fittings and flow control products in the country. Last year, Pantech acquired a second plot of land near Nautic\\u2019s existing factory and has installed new equipment to expand product range, which will include nickel alloy items such as duplex and super duplex. Utilisation stands at about 75% following the capacity increase \\u2014 supportive of growth over the next year or two. The expansion also includes extra warehousing space.  Capital expenditure is now estimated at about RM24 million in FY15, lower than that in FY14 but higher than our previous estimate \\u2014 after taking into account spending for new equipment for the carbon steel plant. Growth to gain traction in FY16 We forecast slower sales growth of about 6% for FY15, with gradually stronger demand going into the second half of the year. Sales growth should pick up in FY16, estimated at about 15%.  Net profit growth, however, is expected to outpace sales increase on expectations that the margins improvement in 2HFY14 will continue into FY15.  Thus, net profit is estimated at RM62.4 million, up 12% for the current financial year, and to expand further to RM73.7 million in FY16.  Pantech\\u2019s valuations remain attractive relative to the oil and gas sector as well as the broader market. The stock is now trading at price-earnings multiples of 9.1 and 7.7 times our estimated earnings for FY15 and FY16 respectively.  The company has some 74.8 million warrants \\u2014 with exercise price of 60 sen and a long expiry, in December 2020 \\u2014 and 34.3 million irredeemable convertible unsecured loan stock outstanding. Even on a fully diluted basis, the stock is still modestly valued at roughly 10.2 and 8.7 times our estimated earnings for FY15 and FY16\\u00a0 respectively. Strengthening balance sheet supportive of dividends Of note, Pantech\\u2019s balance has been strengthening over the past year, with major expansions completed \\u2014 the acquisition of Nautic and commissioning of the stainless steel plant. Gearing dropped to 31% at end-FY14, from 47% in FY13. With improved cash flow, we forecast gearing to fall further over the next few years \\u2014 barring any new acquisition. As such, we expect Pantech can comfortably maintain a fairly generous dividend payout. Dividends totalled 4.4 sen per share in FY14, or equivalent to about 45% of net profit.  Assuming a similar payout level, dividends will total some five sen per share for the current financial year and 5.9 sen in FY16. These will earn shareholders higher than market average net yields of 5% and 5.9% at the current share price for the two years respectively. In all, we remain upbeat that Pantech can offer shareholders prospects of longer-term growth on top of attractive yields.

A second RSC for Coastal-Petra JV Coastal Energy and Petra Energy already have a 70:30 joint-venture company called Coastal Energy KBM Sdn Bhd. The JV company is developing the Kapal, Banag and Meranti (KBM) cluster of oilfields after being awarded the contract by Petronas in late June 2012. Late last year, the Kapal field - located off the shores of Peninsular Malaysia - struck oil, with the initial production estimated at between 10,000 barrels per day (bpd) and a peak of 13,000 bpd. According to industry players, this RSC has put Coastal Energy and Petra Energy in a good light as work was done within budget and the time frame taken was only slightly off schedule. In contrast, other RSCs - for the Berantai cluster, awarded to SKP and Petrofac Ltd, and for the Balai cluster, held by a consortium made up of ROC Oil of Australia, Dialog Group Bhd and Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd - have had to grapple with several issues. In July 2013, it was reported that there was a six-month delay in the Balai cluster due to bad weather and changes in the conversion of the early production vessel known as Balai Mutiara. Earnings found wanting The success of the KBM cluster has not been reflected in Petra Energy's financials as it only struck oil late last year. For the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2013, Petra Energy suffered a net loss of RM1.1 million on sales of RM159.4 million. In its notes, the company attributes the bleeding to an impairment loss of RM8.9 million. For the financial year ended Dec 31, 2013, its net profit rose 56% to RM11.7 million, although revenue fell 24.7% to RM492.8 million.  It is also noteworthy that for FY2013, Petra Energy's net cash flow from operating activities was a negative RM71.5 million. Meanwhile, its finance cost for the year was RM12 million, a tad higher than its net profit. As at end-December last year, the company had cash and bank balances of RM112.3 million while its long-term borrowings stood at RM106.3 million and short-term debt commitments were RM94.4 million. In the notes to the financials, Petra Energy says, \"The oil and gas industry is slated for sustained growth over the next three to five years in both the offshore and onshore sectors. \"The government's focus on domestic oil and gas production by enhancing oil recovery, developing small fields and increasing exploration activities to locate new fields is one of the key growth areas that would positively impact the Petra Energy group.\" In a note released after the company's financial results were announced, RHB Research Institute says FY2014 may be the year Petra Energy sees its earnings turn around.

Holcim Malaysia is currently operating a 1.2 million tonne per annum (tpa) grinding plant in Pasir Gudang, Johor, that leads us to believe a potential asset injection of this unit into Lafarge Malaysia is possible. We do see synergy with the possible merger or acquisition of Holcim Malaysia as Lafarge Malaysia is also operating a 700,000tpa grinding plant in the same area to service clients in Peninsular Malaysia\\u2019s southern region.  The company\\u2019s integrated plant in Langkawi, Kedah, has been exporting excess clinker at marginal costing. Hence, the transaction may see Lafarge Malaysia channel more clinker to Holcim Malaysia at better margins, as the larger quantity may mean savings in logistics costs. We also think that the market may have overlooked the recent cut in cement rebates, which could be sufficient to cover higher power costs, and that a revision of its list price may be around the corner.  Alam Maritim Resources BhdFair value: RM2.05 BUY AMRESEARCH (April 07): The group plans to invest in an US$80 million modern diving support ship, which will be operated together with a joint-venture partner as part of Alam\\u2019s strategy to secure more underwater inspection, repair and maintenance jobs. This vessel will be deployed together with the group\\u2019s fleet of remotely operated vehicles. We are positive on the group\\u2019s expansion into underwater services as Alam hopes to secure parts of the RM1.2 billion to RM1.5 billion contracts that were earlier extended to Offshoreworks Group, which currently in financial distress. We understand that the group is looking at an equity raising exercise via a potential placement of 10% to 15% as Alam is exploring new upstream ventures such as jackup rigs. As the Alam-Swiber venture failed to secure a package under the Pan-Malaysia transport and installation umbrella concession late last year, the joint venture is actively seeking new projects in the region. Valuations are compelling at a FY14F PER of nine times\\u00a0 \\u2014 half of the oil and gas sector\\u2019s 18 times. Petronas Gas BhdTarget price: RM28.06 BUY HWANGDBS RESEARCH (April 07): Petronas Gas (Petgas) has entered into a new 20-year gas processing and transportation agreement with Petronas. The new terms are more favourable due to an 18% growth in reservation charges (RC). Petronas will provide dry gas for internal consumption at no cost and the increase in RC will more than offset the lower earnings from the performance base structure.  Petronas has approved the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (Rapid) project with an estimate cost of US$16 billion and another US$11 billion for the associated facilities. Petgas is likely to secure a new regas plant under the Rapid project due to its involvement in the Melaka regas plant as the Pengerang plant will be connected to its Peninsular Gas Utilisation network.  Petgas\\u2019 share price was flat over the last three months over concerns about the gas agreement renewal and Rapid decision. Our \\u201cbuy\\u201d rating is premised on solid fundamentals with no fuel and pricing risks; upside from the gas subsidy rationalisation plan; and promising outlook, solid balance sheet and strong parentage.Padini Holdings BhdTarget price: RM2.35 BUY MAYBANKIB RESEARCH (April 08): Padini group will have seven new Brands Outlets (BO) and four new Padini Concept Stores (PCS) by end-FY14 as compared with our original assumption of five new BO and four new PCS. This will add 90,000 to 100,000 sq ft to the group\\u2019s total retail space of around 720,000 sq ft as at end-FY13. BO will spearhead earnings growth over the next few years, given its value proposition and bundling strategy that are well accepted by shoppers. Positively, same store sales growth (SSSG) for BO and PCS improved in 2QFY14, taking 1HFY14 SSSG of BO and PCS to +24% and -3.6% respectively. The group is reviewing its pricing strategy to offer more value-added products. We raise our earnings by 2% for FY14 and FY15, taking into account the higher-than-expected new store openings. For FY15 to FY16, we have assumed a flat SSSG for all brands except BO.  Higher valuations are warranted for Padini, given that the domestic consumer sector trades at a 2014 PER of 18.2 times and offers a two-year earnings CAGR of just 10% versus 12.6 times PER and 12% earnings CAGR for Padini. also, Padini\\u2019s yields are attractive at 5.9% for 12-month forward.  Sime Darby BhdTarget price: RM10 OUTPERFORMKENANGA RESEARCH (April 08): Sime Darby is selling its 75% stake in Port Dickson Power Bhd (PDP) for RM300 million to Malakoff\\u2019s wholly-owned Hypergantic Sdn Bhd (HPS). Note that PDP owns a \\u201cpeaking plant\\u201d with a 440mw capacity and HPS owns a 25% stake in PDP. The deal is expected to be completed in 2Q14 or 4Q14 of Sime Darby\\u2019s financial year. The effective valuation of RM400 million reflects 5.2 times historical PER. Despite the seemingly low valuation, we believe that Sime Darby has made the right decision to offload a non-core asset, considering that PDP has less than two years left on its power purchase agreement. Additionally, the deal is expected to allow management to focus on its other core business. Excluding this deal, Sime Darby\\u2019s key earnings driver will still be crude palm oil (CPO), which we expect the average price to be RM2,800 per tonne in 2014. Hence, we believe that Sime Darby\\u2019s 2H14 earnings are likely to be higher than that of 1H14 due to the higher CPO prices. The deal should result in short-term positive sentiment for the stock. Tune Ins Holdings BhdTarget price: RM2.31 BUYKAF-SEAGROATT & CAMPBELL SECURITIES (April 07): Tune Ins has received the nod from Thai authorities to own up to 49% in Osotspa Insurance in Thailand. We are optimistic about this development as it will allow the group to capture a bigger underwriting share in online travel insurance in one of AirAsia\\u2019s fastest-growing markets. Tune Ins is reportedly negotiating with new potential partners to revive its merger and acquisition (M&A) plans in Indonesia after failing to acquire a 70% stake in PT Batavia Mitratama Insurance last year. Thailand and Indonesia are key markets for the group\\u2019s online travel insurance business. We view both developments positively as having local insurance licences in the two countries would enable Tune Ins to underwrite the travel insurance business directly.  The higher net earned premiums coupled with low claims from travel insurance could potentially boost its underwriting profits. In addition to ongoing M&A plans, Tune Ins is also looking at further tie-ups with airlines and travel providers, including Cebu Pacific and Cozmo Travel. Mudajaya Group BhdTarget price: RM3.19 ADDCIMB RESEARCH (April 07): The Edge reported that the RM2 billion job to build the 14.9km Kinrara-Damansara Expressway (Kidex) is now a two-horse race between Mudajaya and Bina Puri Holdings Bhd. The two are the most likely winners among the five companies shortlisted. We still believe that Mudajaya has the best chance of securing the projects due to its good track record of building highways in the Klang Valley, especially elevated ones. The group\\u2019s last highway project was the RM2 billion-to-RM3 billion KL-Kuala Selangor Expressway.  Our sources indicated that Kidex is likely to be awarded in 2H14 as construction is scheduled to start by next year. Kidex is the next highway in the government\\u2019s plan after the RM5 billion-to-RM6 billion West Coast Expressway. This news supports our view that private sector-driven projects will accelerate this year.  Securing Kidex would more than double Mudajaya\\u2019s order book from RM1 billion to RM3 billion. Kidex is an added boost to the potential power plant awards worth an estimated RM400 million to RM500 million for Track 3A and current RM1 billion for Track 3B. Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings BhdFair value: RM4.30 BUYAMRESEARCH (April 07): We maintain our \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings (MMHE) with an unchanged fair value of RM4.30 per share based on a FY14F PER of 25 times \\u2014 a 13% premium to Kencana Petroleum\\u2019s peak of 22 times in 2007. We maintain FY14F to FY16F earnings as investigations are ongoing on the cause of the slippage of the Tapis enhanced oil recovery (EOR) structure during its load-out stage. The extent of any earnings impact on MMHE, which was in charge of moving the Tapis R structure on its skids to the vessel, is uncertain at this stage. But 10% of the value of the Tapis R structure may account for 40% of MMHE\\u2019s FY14F earnings. Despite this setback, we remain positive on MMHE, given the roll-out of multiple EOR projects involving high-capital expenditure central processing platforms and the recent approval for Petronas\\u2019 Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development project in Pengerang, Johor. The stock currently trades at an attractive FY15F PER of 19 times \\u2014 24% below SapuraCrest Petroleum\\u2019s 2007 peak of 25 times. Pantech Group Holdings BhdFair value: RM1.26 NON-RATEDMIDF RESEARCH (April 08): Recently, Pantech was given the certification by NORSOK (Norwegian safety standards) that will increase its value-add abilities. This will translate into potential future project acquisitions, which will boost company earnings. However, investors should not be deterred with relatively flat projected earnings, stemming from weaker-than-anticipated local demand, as key projects in the recently approved Rapid and other fabrication works are likely to sustain sales. We believe that investors can look forward to a strong dividend payout ratio of 40% to 45%. Pantech is an attractive dividend play stock as yields at current price levels are north of 5% per annum. Apart from being a dividend play, its forward PER remains attractive, ranging from mid-to-high single digit. Although the company suffered sell-downs when it was removed from the Shariah-compliant list, the company aims to be shariah compliant again by end-2014. We are valuing Pantech with a fair value of RM1.26, pegging its EPS for 2015 of 10.5 sen to PER for 2015 of 12 times, which is the highest PER that the stock has achieved over the last five years. Cypark Resources BhdTarget price: RM3.20 OUTPERFORMPUBLIC INVESTMENT BANK (April 08): Fresh off the securing of a construction-related job just about a month ago, Cypark announced its successful tender for the proposed upgrading of the Kajang SILK Highway from the Uniten interchange to the UPM interchange. While the previous one was a one-year RM17.8 million job to construct Phases 1 and 2 of the Fairview International School in Nusajaya, the current one is an 18-month RM34.5 million contract that is expected to be completed by October 2015. Again, this is a welcome development that replenishes its order book for its non-renewable energy segment.  We make no adjustments to our earnings estimates as this also forms part of our replenishment assumption of about RM100 million per annum for the coming years. 1Malaysia Development Bhd\\u2019s recent foray into solar power generation, considering its vast other power-related asset holdings, amplifies the case and attractiveness of the renewable energy space, in particular solar. While Cypark has reportedly been approached to partner it in this project, given its know-how, we see the group already thriving on its own. CB Industrial Product Holding BhdTarget price: RM4.48 HOLDHONG LEONG IB RESEARCH (April 08): CBIP received a letter of acceptance from Sime Darby Plantation to design, supply, deliver and commission a 30-tonne per hour Modipalm Continuous Sterilisation palm oil mill in Grand Mount estate, Liberia, worth RM38.5 million. Based on our estimates, the latest contract announcement will boost CBIP\\u2019s total unbilled sales for the palm oil mill engineering division to RM524.2 million, equivalent to 1.65 times of the division\\u2019s turnover in 2013. This is in line with our view that CBIP is on track to secure more contracts and the strong demand prospects for palm oil mill (which in turn is underpinned by rising plantation landbank). We maintain our \\u201chold\\u201d call, as we already assumed CBIP would win RM400 million worth of contracts this year in our earnings forecasts. We continue to like CBIP for its strong earnings visibility (arising from the bright demand prospects for CPO mill, witnessed by the strong order book) and balance sheet. We believe further share price upside will likely be capped by its current valuation (year to date, share price has risen by 41.9%). Affin Holdings Bhd Target price: RM4.25 NEUTRALALLIANCE RESEARCH (April 09): Affin announced in January that the group is acquiring Hwang-DBS Investment Bhd, its asset management and futures businesses for RM1.36 billion.  Management has guided that the group is expected to realise synergistic benefits progressively of RM84 million in PBT from 2015 to 2017, while incurring one-off integration costs amounting to RM54 million by 2015 during the exercise.  From 2018 onwards, the group will be able to achieve synergistic benefits of RM43 million PBT per annum. We trim our target price for Affin to RM4.25, applying a steeper 12% discount to our Gordon Growth valuation model. Our 10% discount is to partially reflect the earnings dilution from its equity raising exercise to acquire Hwang-DBS\\u2019s selective assets. Our target price implied a one times FY14 price-to-book ratio and a sustainable 9.9% return on equity based on our Gordon Growth valuation model.  We will adjust our earnings estimates accordingly to reflect the dilutive impact from the enlarged share base once the right issue price and number of new shares to be issued are determined.

Petronas warned Malaysian offshore support vessel (OSV) suppliers of falling rates and the likelihood of an oversupply situation. We believe the negative newsflow could partially explain Nam Cheong\\u2019s recent share price weakness. However, we maintain our view that the fundamental strength of Malaysian waters is still intact. We also commend Petronas\\u2019 move to rein in suppliers\\u2019 bullishness. Among the Southeast Asian countries, we view Malaysia as one of the more proactive and pro-supportive of its offshore oil and gas industry. It has also implemented coordinated and correct policies and measures. It is a good time to buy Nam Cheong\\u2019s shares, which are trading at seven times 2015 earnings on a two-year earnings per share CAGR of 13%.

PT Gudang Garam Tbk Target price: IDR56,000 BUY RHB OSK RESEARCH (April 1): Gudang Garam\\u2019s (GGRM) FY13 revenue grew 13.1% to IDR55.4 trillion on higher volume (+6% y-o-y) from its SKM mild products and higher blended selling price. Revenue from SKM in 4Q13 reached IDR13.7 trillion (up 26.1% y-o-y) while earnings from SKT stood at IDR1.1 trillion (up 30.3% y-o-y). A hefty interest expense of IDR755 billion exerted pressure on FY13 bottom line, which grew 7.8% y-o-y to IDR4.3 trillion.  The raw materials-to-sales ratio in 4Q13 was stable at 19.7%, compared with 3Q13\\u2019s 19.5%. The excise tax-to-sales ratio fell to 59% in the same quarter from 62% in 3Q13. These figures indicate that cost pressures have eased. GGRM\\u2019s FY13 capital expenditure was IDR5.4 trillion while its net gearing fell to 39.6%, compared with 9M13\\u2019s 42.9%. Following the full-year results, we increase our 2014/15 earnings projections by 6% per year, mainly on lower interest expense assumptions.  Maintain \\u201cbuy\\u201d with a new target price of IDR56,000, up from IDR46,500. This implies a 20 times 2014 earnings. Our call is premised on GGRM\\u2019s strong revenue growth, easing cost pressure and cheap valuations \\u2014 at a 22% discount to consumer staple peers.  Security Bank CorpTarget price: PHP122.50 BUY MAYBANK ATR KIM ENG (April 1): Security Bank Corp (SECB) plans to issue up to PHP10 billion worth of Basel III-compliant Tier 2 notes as part of its capital and balance sheet management. The management says its core return on equity (ROE) target for the year is 12%. This suggests FY14 earnings guidance of PHP5.2 billion (+4% y-o-y), excluding volatile treasury income. SECB is also embarking on a five-year marketing plan to boost its retail banking operations. It aims to lift consumer loans to a third of its total loan portfolio from 6% currently.  We have a -3%/-2% change in our FY14/15 net income estimates after factoring in the impact of the Tier 2 notes. Our assumption is based on a single-tranche format to be issued in 2H14 with a coupon rate of 5.5%. We estimate SECB\\u2019s interest costs will increase 2% and 19% in FY14 and FY15 respectively, compressing net interest margins of 20 basis points (bps) to 3.06% in FY14 and 3bps to 3.03% in FY15. Our earnings revision results in ROE of 12.1% this year and 13.1% in FY15. SECB\\u2019s share price has fallen 8% year to date, giving investors an upside potential of 15%.  CapitaLand LtdFair value: S$3.50 BUY OCBC INVESTMENT RESEARCH (March 31): CapitaLand (CAPL) said it has acquired a 60% stake in two adjacent prime residential sites in Chengdu, China, for RMB752 million. These parcels have an estimated gross floor area of 479,850 sq m and are located in the Tianfu New Area, which focuses on advanced manufacturing and high-end service industries.   The acquisitions are subject to approval by the authorities and expected to be completed by 2Q14. Construction will begin in 2Q14 and the first phase will be launched by the end of the year.  The Chinese credit markets are experiencing increasing pressure as the authorities opt to let weaker companies go into financial default, and we believe this could present acquisition opportunities for CAPL as its Chinese peers grapple with tightening credit conditions and rising cost of debt. CAPL enjoys a strong balance sheet with an estimated S$6.9 billion in cash and net gearing of 29% after its recent divestment of Australand. Maintain \\u201cbuy\\u201d on CAPL. Pending completion of the acquisitions, we keep our fair value unchanged at S$3.50. PT Lippo Karawaci TbkTarget price: IDR1,500 BUY RHB RESEARCH INSTITUTE (April 1): Lippo Karawaci\\u2019s (LPKR) 4Q13 net profit grew 9% q-o-q and 22% y-o-y to IDR399 billion, bringing full-year net profit to IDR1.3 trillion (+24% y-o-y). Revenue climbed 10% q-o-q to IDR1.9 trillion.  Healthcare revenue soared 25% y-o-y to IDR674 billion in 4Q13. On a yearly basis, revenue from its seven existing hospitals grew 21% y-o-y while its nine new hospitals contributed IDR485 billion, representing 19% of healthcare revenue. Its thin bottom line margin of 2% was impacted by investments and a rapid ramp-up in new hospitals.  Our new target price of IDR1,500 (from IDR1,300) is derived from applying a 30% discount to our RNAV estimate of IDR2,170, after considering its new hospitals in 2013 \\u2014 including Siloam Hospitals in Bali and TB Simatupang, Jakarta, as well as two brownfield hospitals in Bali \\u2014 landbank adjustments and higher land sale prices in Makassar, and its reduced effective ownerships in Siloam Hospitals to 78.9% from 86%.

China Merchants Holdings International Co LtdTarget price: HK$33.30 BUY MAYBANK KIM ENG (April 1): China Merchants will issue HK$15.3 billion worth of three-year mandatory convertible securities (MCS) on the basis of one for every five shares held, at HK$30.26 apiece. The MCS carries a coupon rate of 8%/6%/4% for each year respectively and will be converted to shares at the end of the period. China Merchants will use the proceeds to repay debt (55%), fund capital expenditure (40%) and as working capital (5%). Its FY13 earnings stood at HK$4.21 billion (+10.3% y-o-y), 3.7% higher than our forecast. Recurring earnings grew 18.8% y-o-y.  Container throughput increased 18.5% thanks to the Terminal Link acquisition in mid-FY13.  We revise our FY14F and FY15F earnings by +1.4% and -4.7% respectively to factor in better-than-expected results and impact of the MCS interest costs. We expect throughput to grow 12% for FY14 and 5.2% for FY15. We think there will be no MCS conversion in the near term, so cost for FY14 to FY16 is higher interest expenses. We also think the stock\\u2019s PER of 14 times for FY14F is not demanding compared with its five-year trading range of 10.8 to 27 times.  Pacific Radiance LtdTarget price: S$1.22 BUY UOB KAY HIAN (April 1): Pacific Radiance now offers a 15.1% upside to our target price of S$1.22. Our target price is based on a 2015F PER of 9.5 times. This is in line with the long-term (2004 to current) one-year forward PER mean of 9.5 times for the offshore support vessel (OSV)-owner segment of the Singapore oilfield services sector.  The sector\\u2019s overall one-year forward EPS growth has been improving since early 2012, but PER valuation improvement has lagged.  With a superior management and a virtuous-circle business model, there is case for Pacific Radiance to trade at a higher PER valuation than the long-term PER mean. In the Singapore OSV-owner segment, Pacific Radiance\\u2019s return on equity of 15% for 2014-16 is the highest after Ezion\\u2019s 23%.  The listing of Robert Kuok\\u2019s PACC Offshore Services Holdings Pte Ltd at valuations higher than 2015F PER of 9.5 times is likely to lead to a higher target price for Pacific Radiance. A higher 2015F PER of 11 to 12 times would imply a new target price of S$1.42 to S$1.55, raising upside potential to 34% to 46% from 15.1% currently. Advanced Info Service pclTarget price: THB270 BUY ASIA PLUS SECURITIES (March 31): We project Advanced Info Service\\u2019s (AIS) 1Q14 normalised profit to stay unchanged q-o-q at THB9.2 billion.  Income from voice service (61% of total service revenue) is likely to drop 2% q-o-q while income from non-voice service (32% of total service revenue) is expected to grow 3.2%. However, the number of 3G network subscribers has increased to 20 million (50% of total subscribers) from 16.5 million in 4Q13, lowering overall revenue sharing cost by 6.4% q-o-q.  AIS is expected to benefit from a decreasing revenue sharing cost/service revenue ratio as more subscribers migrate to 3G. However, 2Q14 net profit is likely to fall q-o-q; 2Q14 service revenue will drop due to a low season. Net profit is expected to rebound in 3Q14 and rise to the year\\u2019s high in 4Q14 thanks to the peak season.  Although AIS\\u2019s profit is expected to grow at a slower rate than the sector\\u2019s average, its expected FY2014 PER is 16.6 times, considerably lower than the sector\\u2019s average of 20.6 times. Therefore, AIS\\u2019s price is likely to outperform the sector\\u2019s. As its current share price has a 21% upside with over 6% dividend yield, we recommend a \\u201cbuy\\u201d.

A single-tier dividend of 9 sen was declared for the quarter as expected. The total dividend declared for FY14 comes up to a total of 16 sen, which is well within our assumptions of 15.4 sen. According to the company\\u2019s management, the approval for its Bandar Cemerlang township project is on its way, while the joint-venture project in Nusa Cemerlang Industrial Park (NCIP) to build apartments is already at building plan submission stage.  We lowered our FY15 estimated core earnings by 11% to RM84.8 million as we reduced our property sales assumption from RM250 million to RM210 million due to the timing of launches.  We introduce our FY16 earnings estimates of RM93.2 million as we expect the growth will be supported by new launches that are skewed towards the end of FY15. Maintain \\u201coutperform\\u201d.  Bumi Armada BhdTarget price: RM4.50 BUY MAYBANK RESEARCH (Sept 25): In 1QFY2013, we expect Glomac to record strong net profit growth of 18% y-o-y to RM20 million to RM22 million, 20% of our full-year estimates, driven by record unbilled sales of RM731 million at end-FY2012. However, q-o-q growth will likely be flat or marginally softer. Overall operating margins should stay above 20% on greater contributions from the high-margin Glomac Damansara. Glomac\\u2019s 1QFY2013 results are likely to meet our expectations.  We maintain our earnings forecasts and RM1.10 target price (40% discount to revised net asset value) for now. Our \\u201cbuy\\u201d call is based on a 12-month investment horizon. As at April, township projects (including Glomac Puchong and the newly acquired Ijok and Dengkil land) account for 82% of Glomac\\u2019s RM5.8 billion in remaining gross development value, providing a strong base for future earnings. Glomac is trading at a steep 30% discount to its NTA (as at April) and 57% discount to our RM1.82 RNAV. It also offers an attractive REIT-like net yield of 5.6% (compared with large-cap REITs\\u2019 5%). AirAsia X BhdTarget price: RM0.75 NEUTRAL ALLIANCE RESEARCH (March 31): We remain cautious on AirAsia X\\u2019s (AAX) yield in FY14 as we believe it will continue to face intense competition in the Australian routes in the near term following substantial additional capacity by both AAX and Malaysian Airline System Bhd in 3QFY13. This is in line with the management\\u2019s guidance that pressure on its Australian yields is expected to persist over the next few quarters.  We are concerned about the potential spill-over effect from the recent MH370 tragedy as it may lead to aversion among Chinese tourists to visit Malaysia, which may drag AAX\\u2019s yields further. As such, we are tweaking our yields growth assumption downwards to 2% in FY14 from 5% which was too optimistic, considering the recent developments.  We still believe that AAX\\u2019s yields will rise slightly in FY14 due to the withdrawal of the poor-yielding Maldives route that had affected yields in 4QFY13 and improvement in its Jeddah yields as travel demand normalises. We expect AAX\\u2019s yields to increase by 5% in FY15 following its relocation to klia2.  Cypark Resources Bhd Target price: RM3.09 ADD CIMB Research (March 31): Revenue growth for 1QF14 was flattish as it only grew by 1% to RM51.5 million. This was due to lower revenue from its environmental engineering that declined by 3.6%, but was balanced out by landscaping and renewable energy (RE) for which revenues grew by 66% and 72% respectively.  We had previously highlighted that the Sustainable Energy Development Authority (SEDA) was expected to release its new RE quota under the feed-in-tariff programme (FiT) by the end of March. However, news reports suggest that the new quota is only expected by April. Cypark is aiming for at least another 10mw of new RE quota from SEDA. 1Malaysia Development Bhd\\u2019s move (1MDB) to be the first to build a solar power plant outside of the FiT quota is positive for Cypark, as this means that it too can propose a similar project, given its current status as the largest RE player in Malaysia. A mega solar farm such as 1MDB\\u2019s 50mw would almost double Cypark\\u2019s end-FY14 RE capacity target of 50mw.Petronas Gas BhdTarget price: RM21.98 NEUTRAL RHB RESEARCH (April 1): Petronas Gas (PetGas) has entered into a new 20-year gas sale agreement with Petronas, effective today until Dec 31, 2033, for the following: a gas-processing agreement (GPA), a gas-transportation agreement (GTA) comprising GTA Peninsular Malaysia, GTA Sabah and GTA Sarawak and an agent services agreement. The new GPA includes GTA Sabah for the additional gas transport services provided to Petronas for its customers in Kimanis that started in January 2014. The new agreements allow for a revision to the remuneration terms prior to the expiry of each five-year term: i) first term \\u2014 April 1, 2014 to Dec 31, 2018; ii) second term \\u2014 Jan 1, 2019 to Dec 31, 2023; iii) third term \\u2014 Jan 1, 2024 to Dec 31, 2028; and iv) fourth term \\u2014 Jan 1, 2029 to Dec 31, 2033. We keep our FY14/FY15 earnings estimates as the changes in agreement terms are not significant to compel forecast revisions. We maintain \\u201cneutral\\u201d on this stock with an unchanged SOP-based future value of RM1.98.  JT International BhdTarget price: RM7.80 BUY AFFIN INVESTMENT BANK (April 1): In a March 31 Bursa announcement, JT International Holdings, the majority shareholder of JTI Malaysia, has made a buyout offer of RM808.5 million for the remaining 39.6% stake of JTI.  We are pleasantly surprised by the privatisation offer price, which is significantly higher than our previous dividend-discount-model- (DDM) derived target price of RM6. In addition to the offer price, this represents a 20% premium to JTI\\u2019s pre-suspension price and a 21% premium to JTI\\u2019s six-month volume weighted average price trading of shares. At RM7.80 per share, JTI is being valued at a 15 times FY15 2015 estimation EPS and a CY14 estimation per-NTA of 5.7 times as at end-December 2013.  In view of the challenging prospects for the tobacco industry and the strong offer on hand, we think that there is no reason for minorities to reject the deal. While we upgrade the stock to \\u201cbuy\\u201d and raise our DDM-based target to RM7.80, we expect the stock to trade near its offer price upon re-quotation.  Astro Malaysia Holdings BhdTarget price: RM3.60 BUY HWANGDBS VICKERS RESEARCH (April 1): Astro Malaysia Holdings\\u2019 FY14 earnings of RM448 million is within our and consensus expectations at 96% and 98% of respective earnings\\u2019 estimates.  Astro will continue to enjoy average revenue per user uplift from improving take-up of B.yond HD channels as well as full-year recognition of package price increases. This would also be bolstered by full-year recognition of revenue from Astro\\u2019s Barclays Premier League channel-supply partnership with Telekom Malaysia Bhd. Margins are expected to be resilient as its set-up box swap-out exercise eases and depreciation tapers off in the longer term. Its share of advertising expenditure in the overall market is also steadily rising, which will add to its strong subscription revenue. The stock offers bright earnings growth prospects in a fairly defensive market, and could surprise on the back of utilisation of new transponder capacity through its satellite launch, which is expected in 2Q14.  Eastern & Oriental BhdFair value: RM3 BUY AMRESEARCH (April 3): We reaffirm our \\u201cbuy\\u201d recommendation on Eastern & Oriental (E&O) with an unchanged fair value of RM3 per share \\u2014 a 35% discount to our NAV of RM4.61 per share, including the significant accretion from Seri Tanjung Pinang 2 (STP2).  A local daily reported that E&O\\u2019s share price has risen to reflect the progress in STP2 and the timeline of events of its STP project. Our key investment thesis on E&O is centred on the crystallisation of STP2 given the tripling of NAV and the deep development potential of the 760-acre prime land. E&O is awaiting the Department of Environment\\u2019s approval for the Detailed Environment Impact Assessment study on the commencement of reclamation works on STP2. We recommend that investors accumulate E&O ahead of the sustained news flow momentum as STP2 moves closer to realisation. This may lead to a narrowing of the current NAV discount of 52% via an accelerated share price discovery of its fair value.Padini Holdings BhdTarget price: RM2.40 BUY HWANG DBS VICKERS RESEARCH (April 3): Padini plans to open three brands outlet (BO) and two Padini Concept Stores (PCS) before end-June. This will add 40,000 sq ft to 50,000 sq ft of floor area to take total new area to 96,000 sq ft to 120,000 sq ft in FY14. Going forward, Padini wants to open at least five outlets a year. We raised FY15 to FY16 forecast EPS by 3% to 8% after imputing larger earnings contribution from BO and PCS. The near-term earnings growth driver will likely be BO. BO focuses on offering a wide variety of value-for-money products targeted at the low- to middle-income consumers. We believe BO margins are higher given fitting cost is 45% lower than PCS. BO has an impressive track record with five-year PBT CAGR of 118%. BO contributed 25% of FY13 revenue. Current valuation is attractive at 11 times FY15 EPS given the resilient earnings, continuous expansion plans, 25% return on equity and a strong balance sheet. Dividends could surprise as expanding BO generally requires lower capital expenditure and costs. Our 70% payout ratio for FY14F implies 5% yield. Sentoria Group BhdTarget price: RM1.20 BUY TA SECURITIES (April 2): Last year was eventful for Sentoria Group as it has proposed two massive integrated resort cities in Morib and Kuching. The group should see busy years ahead given that Bandar Samariang and Morib Bay will commence in 2014 and 2015 respectively. We like Sentoria\\u2019s synergistic business model, which allows it to enjoy earnings upside from property development and at the same time, benefit from its strong cash-generating leisure and hospitality business.  Sentoria is operating in two business divisions, namely property development and leisure and hospitality. The group has around 1,500 acres of undeveloped landbank with an estimated gross development value of RM6.6 billion. The group\\u2019s leisure and hospitality operation consists of two theme parks and two resorts within Bukit Gambang Resort City. Our target price is at a 38% discount to the group\\u2019s fully-diluted RNAV of RM1.95 per share. There could be further upside to RNAV as we have conservatively assumed a 70% take-up rate for properties in Morib Bay RC and Borneo Samariang RC.SapuraKencana Petroleum BhdTarget price: RM5.36 BUY MIDF RESEARCH (April 2): SapuraKencana Petroleum has bagged one fresh contract and three contract extensions. The newly secured jobs are worth a collective US$454 million. Although we have factored in these potential job wins, we are taking this opportunity to adjust our FY15 earnings estimates slightly higher by 2.4%. We are assuming lower financing costs from the recently undertaken debt restructuring exercise and also a higher fleet utilisation rate of over 65%. SapuraKencana\\u2019s order book remains strong at US$8.3 billion. Broken down geographically, 49% of the jobs are from Brazil, 31% from Malaysia, 14% from Southeast Asia, 5% from Australia and the rest from Africa. Tender book value is almost similar to the current order book at RM25 billion.We are still bullish on SapuraKencana and we are reiterating our \\u201cbuy\\u201d recommendation at a revised target price of RM5.36 per share. This is based on FY15 EPS of 23.3 sen, pegged to FY15 PER of 23 times. Our target PER is a slight premium to our large-cap sector PER of 20 times. Uzma BhdTarget price: RM7.30 OUTPERFORM KENANGA RESEARCH (April 2): Uzma and its partner EQ Petroleum Developments Malaysia Sdn Bhd announced that they have signed a Small Field Risk Service Contract (SFRSC) with Petroliam Nasional Bhd to carry out the development and production of petroleum from the Tanjung Baram Fields for a period of nine years.  The development phase of the entire SFRSC is expected to cost US$100 million and first oil is anticipated in 2015. EQ Petroleum Developments has a 70% stake whilst Uzma has a 30%\\u00a0 stake in the venture. Assuming a 80:20 equity-to-debt ratio; 6% cost of debt and 15 % internal rate of return, we believe Uzma\\u2019s 30% stake will yield accretive earnings of RM5.2 million in FY15. Our new target price is RM7.30 is based on an unchanged targeted FY15 PER of 16 times. Our PER is justifiable given that the stock has successfully moved up the value chain instead of just being a service provider. As its share base is pretty illiquid, the share price gains can be significant.

He said the new GPTA is essentially similar to the old agreement, despite some changes in the terms. \\u201cThe major change is PetGas's fixed reservation charges that is now based on a per unit basis of RM2,330 per mmscfd, from a previous fixed monthly charge of RM103.5 million,\\u201d said Faisal. \\u201cAs for anything above an agreed threshold, it would be charged a flow rate charge of 20 sen per GJ from 22 sen per GJ previously.\\u201d Meanwhile, Affin Investment Bank Research said PetGas\\u2019 performance based on the structure (PBS) income would likely be lower. \\u201cThus, we believe the higher income base for fixed reservation charge is to help offset the gradually lower gas volumes in the next 20 years and lower PBS income structure,\\u201d said Affin IB research analyst Chong Lee Len.

Petronas executive vice-president of exploration and production Datuk Wee Yiaw Hin said the agreement was signed\\u00a0 during the conference. However, no details were revealed.

With the assumption of: (i) US$100 million capex; (ii) project internal rate of return (IRR) of 20%; and (iii) project stake of 30%, we estimate that it will contribute approximately RM14 million or 11 sen per share to Uzma\\u2019s bottom line once production begins. To stay conservative, we do not include the potential RSC award in our forecasts.

In our report titled 2014 Outlook \\u2014 What\\u2019s next?, dated Jan 9, 2014, we had mentioned Uzma as a beneficiary of the RSC contract award.To recap, Uzma recently proposed a renounceable rights issue of up to 132 million rights shares on the basis of one rights share for every one existing share, which is expected to raise up to RM90 million. We believe the funds raised will be used for potential special project(s) such as marginal fields and enhanced oil recovery (EOR).

We estimate Lewek Robin to generate 17% return on equity and US$410,000 in net profit per annum, based on US$949,000 in revenue, US$389,000 depreciation cost (18-year policy) and US$150,000 interest cost (3.3% interest rate). Positive impact to Perisai\\u2019s net profit is US$303,000 per annum, after considering its 51% interest in Intan Offshore. Perisai targets to secure charters for its E3 barge and mobile offshore production unit by 2Q14 and 3Q14 \\u2014 ahead of the 3Q14 and 4Q15 imputed in our earnings model. It aims to secure a contract for its new jack-up rig before the 2Q14 physical delivery date, targeting Southeast Asia. Muhibbah Engineering (M) BhdTarget price: RM3.20 BUY HWANGDBS VICKERS RESEARCH (March 19): The Cambodian airport concession remains a solid cash cow for Muhibbah. It registered record airport passenger arrivals of over five million (up 18% y-o-y) in 2013, translating into a three-year CAGR of 16% (2010-13). We estimate the concession will contribute RM23 million to RM25 million in PBT in FY14 and FY15, and value it at 42 sen per share. We understand there are opportunities to grow Favelle Favco\\u2019s order book of RM1 billion (92% from the O&G sector) by another 10% to 15%. Muhibbah has indicated that demand for offshore cranes remains buoyant. We are optimistic on the group\\u2019s chances of securing sizeable construction contracts this year, largely from Petronas\\u2019 RAPID project. It is also looking at jobs from the West Coast Expressway project given its expertise in the South Klang Valley Expressway. We understand the shipyard unit could triple its order book with new vessel orders. Our target price is SOP-based and implies 10 times FY15F EPS. This is cheap for an O&G play. Cahya Mata Sarawak BhdFair value: RM10.37 BUY RHB RESEARCH (March 19): CMS, the best proxy for the Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy (SCORE), attracted keen institutional interest during our US non-deal roadshow. Investors see upside for its OM Materials Sarawak (OMS) associate and phosphate project under Malaysian Phosphate Additives (Sarawak) (MPA) given attractive power prices, while growth at its other units will be SCORE-driven.  Investors were drawn to the attractive power tariffs offered to heavy industries in Samalaju, Sarawak. Construction on Phase 1 of a smelting project by CMS\\u2019 20%-owned OMS is now in the final stages, with staged commissioning expected from July. Positive progress is seen in the MPA project, while there is upside potential for its 51%-owned Samalaju Property Development. While occupancy rates at its workers lodge may drop, the scale of works at its hotel, amenities, and residential and commercial properties may be larger than we projected. Many investors were impressed with its logistics prowess, which allows it to maintain a tight grip on Sarawak\\u2019s cement market. Protasco BhdTarget price: RM2.90 BUY MIDF RESEARCH (March 18): Protasco\\u2019s revenue grew at a solid six-year CAGR of 9.1%, nearly hitting the RM1 billion mark in 2013. Its profit after tax and non-controlling interest continues to show stable growth, registering a six-year CAGR of 11%.  The group\\u2019s earnings will be derived from: (i) strong construction jobs in the pipeline; (ii) continuation of maintenance concession earnings; (iii) integrated flagship development on a 100-acre land in Bangi and 14.4-acre land in Pasir Gudang, Johor; (iv) profit guarantee from its O&G business; and (v) a healthy balance sheet. Downside risks to our target price include slowdown in the property market, scale back of government jobs and a delay in the implementation of the 10th Malaysia Plan projects. We are initiating coverage with a \\u201cbuy\\u201d recommendation. Our target price of RM2.90 is derived from an FY15 SOP valuation, pegging its construction and road maintenance concessions earnings at PER FY15 of nine times, property development business with RNAV of RM503.7 million and all other business segments at PER FY15 of seven times. Cypark Resources BhdTarget price: RM3.20 OUTPERFORM PUBLICINVEST RESEARCH (March 19): Cypark announced that it secured a one-year RM17.8 million contract to construct Phase 1 and 2 of Fairview International School in Nusajaya, Johor. While it is slightly out of the ordinary for Cypark in terms of its normal business scope of landfill remediation and landscaping, it is a welcome one as it replenishes its order book for its non-renewable energy segment. We make no adjustments to our earnings estimates as this forms part of our order replenishment assumption of about RM100 million this year. We like the value proposition Cypark promises, with ongoing growth in its renewable energy business providing the thrust. Our \\u201coutperform\\u201d call is reaffirmed, with an unchanged target price of RM3.20, premised on a PER of 12 times to FY14 EPS of 27.2 sen. We see this valuation as conservative, as the discounted cash flow value of its renewable energy business alone is already RM2.33 per share, deeming all profit-generating businesses \\u201calmost free\\u201d at current price levels. Glomac BhdTarget price: RM1.16 HOLD HONG LEONG INVESTMENT BANK (March 17): Glomac is acquiring 62.6 acres of leasehold land from Pertubuhan Peladang Kawasan Kuala Selangor for RM23 million, or RM8.43 psf. The land is located in Sungai Buloh, within Glomac\\u2019s existing Bandar Saujana Utama (BSU) township. The proposed acquisition is expected to be completed in FY15 ending April. Glomac does not expect any earnings impact in FY15. We are positive on this as it allows Glomac to continue its highly successful RM1.7 billion gross development value (GDV) BSU township. Glomac intends to develop the extension phase known as BSU4 in FY15 with an estimated RM800 million GDV. This new development land will allow Glomac to capitalise on its success in the locale.  While the RM8.43 psf paid for this land is higher than the RM5.06 psf Glomac paid for its Kuala Selangor land acquisition in February 2012, it is lower than the RM9.36 psf Mah Sing paid for its Rawang land. We consider the land cost fair. AirAsia BhdTarget price: RM3.10 BUY AFFIN INVESTMENT BANK (March 18): We have lowered our FY14 to FY16 EPS forecast for AirAsia by 2.1% to 4.2% after inputting a 2% to 3% lower average fare in anticipation of a prolonged price competition. However, we believe the impact will be partially mitigated as we expect stronger passenger growth of 12% in 2014 \\u2014 from 7.6% previously \\u2014 fuelled by price competition as well as Visit Malaysia Year 2014 (VMY) initiatives.  In 2015 and 2016, we expect a more modest passenger growth of 10% each. We believe this is fair given that AirAsia registered a five-year passenger CAGR (2008 to 2013) of 13.2%. In addition, AirAsia is at an advantage to benefit from the VMY campaigns as it commands 61% of the domestic travel market share and 40% of the international travel market. AirAsia is one of the most cost-efficient airlines with the lowest cost per available seat kilometres (CASK). AirAsia targets to further lower its CASK by 5% to 6% (from 12 sen to 14 sen) through various cost reduction exercises. Uzma BhdTarget price: RM6 HOLD UOB KAY HIAN RESEARCH (March 19): Uzma announced a one-for-one renounceable rights issue of up to 132 million rights shares at 75 sen apiece. The issue price represents a discount of 76.7% to the theoretical ex-rights price of Uzma shares at RM3.22 \\u2014 derived from a five-day volume weighted average price of RM5.69. The minimum subscription level of 67 million rights shares will be achieved via the undertaking by founder-cum-CEO Datuk Kamarul Redzuan Muhamed and his wife, who collectively hold 51% of Uzma. We are positive on the exercise as it could be a prelude to a major contract win. We understand that a significant portion of the RM78 million proceeds allocated for capital expenditure will be reserved for an upcoming project. Uzma is bidding for sizeable special projects, including the provision of chemical enhanced oil recovery super surfactant chemical and injection systems, with a contract value of RM500 million each. It is also bidding for a marginal oilfield project; Uzma could be awarded one of two marginal oilfields up for grabs soon. CB Industrial Product Holding BhdTarget price: RM4.48 HOLD HONG LEONG INVESTMENT BANK (March 18): CBIP has been awarded a contract worth RM46 million from Gilford Ltd, a subsidiary of Rimbunan Hijau, to construct a 60 tonne/hour modipalm continuous sterilisation palm oil mill in Papua New Guinea. Based on our estimates, the latest contract announcement will boost CBIP\\u2019s total unbilled sales for the palm oil mill engineering division to RM485.7 million, equivalent to 1.53 times of the division\\u2019s turnover in 2013. The contract sum will be recognised in 2014 and 2015. We raise our FY14 and FY15 earnings forecasts higher by 1% to 14%, largely to reflect higher contract wins of RM400 million and RM350 million respectively versus RM300 million per year previously, and higher Ebit margin assumption at the special purpose vehicle division.We raise our target price to RM4.48 and include CBIP\\u2019s plantation landbank in Indonesia in our valuation. However, we believe further share price upside will likely be capped by its current valuation.Bumi Armada BhdTarget price: RM4.43 TRADING BUY ALLIANCE RESEARCH (March 17): Bumi Armada was reported to have acquired a 15-year-old very large crude carrier, heightening speculation that the company is likely to bag a US$1.5 billion (RM4.9 billion) floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) contract in Angola. Shipping sources said Bumi Armada purchased Independent Tankers Corp\\u2019s 309,996 deadweight tonnage Ulysses for below US$25 million. In January, Upstream Online reported that Bumi Armada was the front runner to supply Eni with an FPSO for its East Hub project in Block 15/06 off Angola. Our previous estimate for the contract was RM1.4 billion to RM1.75 billion just for the bareboat charter alone on a seven-year term charter. Should the contract materialise by 1Q14 or 2Q14, there could be an upward revision to our earnings estimates. As it is, we have built in a second FPSO award into our FY14 estimates with a daily bareboat charter of RM250 million per year. The total contract value of US$1.5 billion indicates that the bareboat charter alone could be higher, at RM300 million to RM400 million per year.

Global equity markets ended higher on\nFriday but U.S. stocks sharply pared gains after a late selloff in\nbiotechnology shares, while euro zone government bond yields fell on renewed\nbets the European Central Bank will ease policy next week, according to\nReuters.  The price of Brent crude oil closed\nabove $108 a barrel for its first weekly rise in five, helped by data showing a\nrise in U.S. consumer spending in February, it said.  Affin IB vice president and head of\nretail research Dr Nazri Khan said that following reduced Ukraine-Russia\ntension, he expects the FBM KLCI to stage further rebound driven by inspiring\nglobal data and unexpected dovish statement from European Central Bank and\nPeople Bank Of China.  He said that although the global mood remained cautious\nfollowing the fallout from events in Ukraine, there were pockets of strength\noutside USA market with FTSE Eurofirst 300 index and the Nikkei 225 bouncing to\nits highest close in two weeks while Bovespa index in Brazil rose to a\ntwo-month high and Indian stocks hit a fresh all time record.  Nazri said growing prospects that both European Central\nBanks and People Bank of China will pursue further QE in the near term provides\nthe strongest source of support to global shares.  He said it was obvious that an improvement in risk-taking\nsentiment may have come after Germany ignored Russian sanctions and the IMF\nagreed to a USD18 billion bailout package for Ukraine.  This happened despite the early weakness exacerbated by more\naggressive talk from US President Obama directed at more sanctions towards\nRussia, he said.  Nazri said the global equity market tone therefore should\nsee modest improvement from European economic data, helped by stronger than\nexpected consumer confidence out of France and Italy.  In addition, upbeat US data ie. consumer confidence reading\nwhich hit six month high, markedly higher employment, improved housing market,\nfresh IPO (Kings Candy Crush IPO) and M&A activity (Facebook buying Oculus\nfor USD2bil) should stoke bullish sentiment, he said.  \\u201cMeanwhile, on the newsfront, the following top news should\nbuzz Bursa namely Telekom Malaysia striking RM560 million deal to acquire\nPacket One, Icon Offshore Bhd pressing for RM493 million IPO in 2Q2014,\nTradewinds Group to accumulate 2.31% more to take Bernas off Bursa Malaysia,\nPetronas announcing measures to boost enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects\ntowards 150,000 barrels per day by 2020 and finally 1MDB close to winning solar\nplant contract to build the country\\u2019s largest solar power plant in Kedah.  \\u201cOn the technical front, despite being vulnerable to further\ndownside due to weaker external factors, Bursa have shown an ability to run\ninto new weekly highs (above seven week high of 1840 resistance) in the face of\nnegative geopolitical tension and MAS mishaps,\\u201d he said.  Nazri said the ability of the local market to hold weekly\ngains and close higher was a good relative strength and positive influence.  He said the near term trend for the FBM KLCI firmly favours\nthe bulls, with the next area of support coming in at a corrective target of 1,830\nand 1,820 levels while short term resistance for the local index now hovers at\n1,850 and 1,880 levels respectively.  The bull camp should maintains control until ultimate\nsupport at 1800 level comes out. The FBM KLCI has shown a reliable breakout\nafter being trapped inside 1800-1840 sideway range since February 2014, he\nsaid.  Nazri said this suggests the continuation of the firm\nuptrend that has been in force for the last five years (which has been tested\nfour times successfully since 28th October 2008 - tested & rebounded Sep\n2011, March 2013, August 2013 and latest February 2014).  If this uptrendline extends, the FBM KLCI should be\ncomfortably testing 1,900 by October 2014 and 2,000 by June 2015, he said.  \\u201cOur strategies therefore remain constant, given the tight\nrange Bursa likely to demonstrate in the seasonally weaker April-May, we are\nadvising our customer to buy on dips as we expect the prevailing consolidation\nto stabilize by late June just before the mid-year book is closed.  \\u201cAs for stock picks, we are in favour of technical momentum\nstocks with Astro, Digi, QL Resource, OSK Properties, Daiboci, Tambun, Bonia,\nPrestariang, Yeelee and Datasonic remain our Top Ten featured stocks for next\nweek,\\u201d he said."}, "920": {"date_posted": "27/3/2014", "title": "#Noon Market* KLCI posts marginal gains amid Ukraine crisis, Japan planned tax", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Mar 27): The FBM KLCI erased losses for a marginal gain of 0.34 point or 0.02 % as Asian markets declined. World markets posted losses on Ukraine's political uncertainties and ahead of Japan's planned sales tax hike. In Malaysia, the KLCI was traded at 1,839.48 at 12.30pm. The KLCI had earlier declined on losses in stocks like Petronas Gas Bhd and Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd. Analysts said the Malaysian stock market needed to see more buying and liquidity to rise further. \"While sentiment has improved, stronger buying momentum and liquidity boost on the domestic market will be needed to spur further gains,\" TA Securities Holdings Bhd wrote in a note today. RHB Research Institute Sdn Bhd research head Lim Chee Sing said liquidity was a crucial concern in emerging Asian markets like Malaysia as the US reduced its quantitative easing measures. \"As the uncertainties fade, we believe investors\\u2019 key focus will be on the tightening of liquidity arising from the US\\u2019 tapering of policy stimulus, as well as expectations of the timing and the speed of interest rate adjustments there,\" Lim wrote in a note today.

Reuters reported that Asian markets were in skittish mood on Thursday following a late dip on Wall Street, with Tokyo stocks slipping as investors counted down to a rise in sales tax that is expected to swat consumer spending and test the market's faith in Abenomics.

They gained as much as 25.6%, between Nov 05 and Jan 13. The company\\u2019s warrant, Dialog-WA, did even better over the same period, climbing 106% and hence proving to be a cheaper proxy for the underlying share. It is worth noting that Dialog-WA, which has a strike price of RM2.40 and a conversion ratio of one to one, has seen greater trading activity and a substantial decline in its premium to the underlying share, over the past year.  Based on its closing price of RM1.26 on Jan 13, the warrant is trading at a 7.65% premium to the mother share, as opposed to 20.23% a year ago. Based on Maybank IB Research\\u2019s target price of RM3.90 for Dialog, in a Jan 09 report, the stock theoretically has an upside potential of 14.7%, based on its closing price of RM3.40 on Jan 13. Assuming zero premium, Dialog-WA may rise to RM1.50 apiece (RM3.90-RM2.40), if the mother share meets the research house\\u2019s target price.

Phase 2 will likely involve LNG tank terminals and is expected to commence operations in 2017.\\u201d The research house adds that Phase 3 of the project will likely accommodate oil majors, refineries and petrochemical operators, operating under the RAPID project. \\u201cGetting the green light for RAPID, is a key re-rating catalyst for the stock,\\u201d it says. In a Jan 06 note, Kenanga Research says, a positive decision on RAPID will continue to spur interest in downstream oil and gas operators, such as onshore fabricators, tank terminal operators and process equipment players. It also upgraded Dialog\\u2019s target price from RM3.28 to RM3.90, on expectations that the company is likely to go ahead with the liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal development in Pengerang. \\u201cIn anticipation of a more positive outlook for Pengerang Phase 2A, we have upgraded our target price for Dialog, to RM3.90, on the inclusion of 720,000 cu m of LNG capacity,\\u201d it says.

Stock picking is more challenging, compared with a year ago, after last year\\u2019s rally, say fund managers, who find that valuations have become rather stretched for many counters. Some say, share prices have mostly factored in earnings prospects and that it is time for companies to deliver corporate results, to justify the premium valuations. The stale bulls are concerned that earnings growth may be disappointing, as consumers start tightening their belts, while companies are facing higher costs, as a result of the government\\u2019s subsidy cuts. Expectations that Petroliam Nasional Bhd will continue spending on capital expenditure, has helped sustain the bullishness on the local oil and gas sector, which is seen as one of the sweet spots on Bursa Malaysia.  Meanwhile, the construction industry is also a sector to watch, with the government expected to implement a slew of infrastructure projects. Export-oriented sectors, such as glove makers and the electrical and electronics industry, could benefit from the strong US dollar. On the external front, the improved economic conditions in the US and Europe, and the weaker ringgit, may augur well for export-oriented companies. Below are 10 stocks that are worth watching. StemLife Bhd Cash-rich StemLife Bhd attracted some attention, after Singapore-listed Cordlife Group Ltd bought a stake in the largest cord blood banking facility in Malaysia.  Cordlife acquired a 31.82% stake from StemLife directors, Loh Yoon Kwai and Lim Jit Soon, as well as managing director Datuk Low Su-Shing and deputy managing director Datuk Lim Oi Wah. The latter two have ceased to be substantial shareholders of StemLife. Other major shareholders include Tan Sri Vincent Tan\\u2019s Berjaya Corp Bhd with a 12.12% stake, Capital Group International Inc with 11.31%, and Emerging Markets Growth Fund with 5.05%. As StemLife is said to have a 60% market share in Malaysia and a 40% stake in StemLife Thailand, the stake acquisition would allow Cordlife to break into new markets and fend off competitors, as demand for such services in the region, grows. Previously trading at a weighted average of 26 sen, StemLife\\u2019s share price rose to a three-year peak of 50.5 sen last October (2013), when Cordlife first emerged as a substantial shareholder. On Jan 15, the stock closed at 44.5 sen, translating into a market capitalisation of RM110.1 million.  With cash of up to RM73.7 million as at its 3QFY2013 ended Sept 30, and an issued share capital of 247.5 million, each share is backed by 29.7 sen cash.  Founded in 2001, StemLife has been posting stable earnings, after a bleak period, when the group fell into the red in 2009 and 2010. Since then, the group has recovered, posting a net profit of RM3.1 million in FY2011 and RM5.7 million in FY2012. Earnings per share were 1.9 sen and 3.28 sen, respectively. Gamuda Bhd The stock rallied last year (2013), but many believe that the rally still has legs, because the company is said to be packed with growth catalysts \\u2014 not only the contracts it has in hand, but also more construction jobs that it is expected to win. Its coffers will get a big boost, should it sell its 40% stake in water treatment concessionaire, Syarikat Pengeluar Air Sungai Selangor Sdn Bhd. Gamuda is perceived to be on its way to getting the nod for the RM25 billion Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Line 2, by the cabinet. On top of that, it is seen as the front runner for the high-speed rail project.  In May 2013, Gamuda unveiled the MRT Line 2 plans under the KL Transport Master Plan. The 56km MRT Line 2 (also known as the Orbital Line) will stretch from Sungai Buloh to Putrajaya, and will have 35 stations. The plan has gone through feasibility studies and is awaiting cabinet approval, said to come in 1Q2014.  UOB Kay Hian Research expects the contracts to be awarded by mid-2015, and believes that Gamuda can again, take on the personal development planning (PDP) role for MRT Line 2.  \\u201c[This] would enable it to earn a 6% PDP fee, or an estimated RM750 million [50% stake]. Given its role in MRT Line 1, Gamuda is also likely to secure the tunnelling packages for Line 2, as it would have significant cost advantage, compared with other players,\\u201d says the research house.  Meanwhile, Gamuda has acquired an additional 40% stake in Kesas Expressway, raising its holdings to 70%, in the toll road concessionaire.  In October 2013, Gamuda offered to acquire the remaining 70% stake that it does not own in Kesas, for RM875 million, valuing the concessionaire at about RM1.25 billion. It later upped its offer to RM980 million.  Amcorp Properties Bhd and Permodalan Nasional Bhd, which collectively hold a 40% stake, accepted the offer. But the Selangor State Development Corp, which holds a 30% stake, did not take it up.  Eastern & Oriental Bhd Trading at a weighted average of RM1.95, E&O\\u2019s share price jumped from RM1.65 to RM2.20 in 2013. It closed at RM1.94 on Jan 15.  An imminent catalyst for E&O, is its increase in its asset value from the Seri Tanjung Pinang 2 (STP2) land reclamation project.STP2, which covers 760 acres and has high development potential and a lucrative profit margin, is the primary valuation driver. \\u201cAs STP2 will be reclaimed in two phases, it appears unlikely that E&O would need to do a rights issue,\\u201d says AmResearch, in a note. It adds that E&O is also committed to maintaining its 30% dividend policy.  With Sime Darby Bhd as its parent company, with a 32% stake, E&O has various opportunities to tap the vast landbank of its major shareholder. E&O has just started to access Sime Darby\\u2019s landbank. It recently entered into a memorandum of agreement to acquire 135 acres of prime residential land, said to be earmarked for a lifestyle and wellness-themed project, in Sime Darby\\u2019s City of Elmina\\u00a0 development, located along the Guthrie Corridor Expressway.  E&O also has strong pre-sales in the pipeline, comprising several major projects, such as Avira Wellness Resort in Iskandar Malaysia and Princess House redevelopment in London. \\u201cWe expect the initial 200 units of linked houses [at Avira Wellness Resort] to be fully taken up. Additional sales of RM200 million, will be easily achieved,\\u201d says AmResearch.  The research house reasons that if this materialises, it would provide a significant boost to the Avira project, which has a gross development value of more than RM3 billion. The positive outlook for Avira, is because of the expected strong reception for its phase 1, which comprises 208 terraced houses.  E&O\\u2019s healthy balance sheet is reflected in its net gearing of 33%, as at its 1QFY2014. The group also has unbilled sales of RM550 million, as at end-August.  Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd Big things are expected of this mid-cap outfit, which in the week prior to Jan 20, alone, has seen its share price jump more than 12%, to reach a new high of RM2.58 at Jan 16\\u2019s close. Its market capitalisation was RM1.09 billion. In 2013, Muhibbah received a fabrication licence from Petroliam Nasional Bhd, which enables it to participate in major offshore and onshore fabrication works, for Petronas and other major oil companies in Malaysia. This sent its share price soaring more than 83%, over the span of a month, to RM2.60 on July 25. But the stock is still on analysts\\u2019 recommendation list, with a target price of RM3 or higher. Muhibbah has an integrated business model that includes construction, ship building and crane manufacturing. It is now poised to become a strong proxy to the oil and gas sector. CIMB Research believes that Muhibbah\\u2019s turnaround prospects look exciting, backed by Petronas\\u2019 RM60 billion annual capex, which should benefit the group\\u2019s crane and shipyard divisions. All eyes are on Petronas\\u2019 refinery and petrochemicals integrated development project in Pengerang, Johor, which should see a final investment decision in April. CIMB Research says that Muhibbah\\u2019s opportunities in the project, remain intact. Muhibbah also has a 62% stake in Favelle Favco Bhd \\u2014 a crane operator. Favelle Favco entered the China market in early 2012, and hopes to deliver up to 15 cranes a year, from its operations in China, which could amount to RM100 million a year. Muhibbah now has an order book of RM2.1 billion. The company pulled itself out of the red in 2013, and reported a net profit of RM60.64 million, for nine months ended Sept 30 \\u2014 up 15% from the year before. Its earnings per share stood at 4.86 sen. Muhibbah is currently sitting on cash of some RM310.68 million, but has borrowings amounting to RM234.43 million.Brahim\\u2019s Holdings Bhd The halal in-flight caterer has done well in terms of share price, having gained more than 198% in 2013, but analysts tracking the stock still see upside in the stock. It achieved a new high of RM2.24 on Jan 9, 2014, following news of a collaboration with All Nippon Airways (ANA). The stock closed at RM2.03 on Jan 16, giving it a market capitalisation of RM457.86 million. Just over a week prior to Jan 20, the company announced a collaboration agreement with ANA, for the provision of in-flight halal meals to ANA\\u2019s Asian routes and Middle Eastern airlines, at Haneda and Narita airports. It is said that the partnership could provide a gross contribution of about RM5 million in the first year, and this could double in the second year. This will allow Brahim\\u2019s to move away from its dependence on Kuala Lumpur International Airport\\u2019s traffic flow, and thus, reduce concentration risk of its earnings base, according to Alliance Research. The research house has a \\u201cstrong buy\\u201d on the stock, and recently raised its target price to RM2.67. Hong Leong Investment Bank Research has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on Brahim\\u2019s, with a target price of RM2.64. For the nine months ended Sept 30, 2013, Brahim\\u2019s announced a net profit of RM10.19 million, or 4.74 sen per share, up from RM3.86 million, or 1.96 sen, a year ago. Brahim\\u2019s also operates restaurants and cafes in KLIA and the low-cost carrier terminal, but the bulk of its earnings comes from in-flight catering for Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS). The national carrier accounts for 80% of Brahim\\u2019s revenue. It currently provides in-flight meals to 37 airlines. Apart from the tie-up with ANA, Brahim\\u2019s is also expected to see an earnings boost, when klia2 opens in May. The company is beginning to diversify its business, as it is building sugar refineries in Sarawak and Sabah, which should commence production by 2015. Another draw would be the fact that it is a well-managed company, and will benefit from a rise in passenger traffic during Visit Malaysia Year 2014, say analysts.Ho Hup Construction Co Bhd  Ho Hup Construction Co, currently a PN17 company, sits on a clean balance sheet with low borrowings, after a cash call.  Having reported profits for four consecutive quarters, the company is qualified to seek an upliftment from its PN17 status, which may happen this year. Getting out of PN17 status would be a major boost for Ho Hup, as it would be able to compete for tenders on an equal footing with other bidders. Ho Hup has had to rely on joint-venture partners, to win tenders, or had to play a sub-contractor\\u2019s role, throughout its time as a PN17 company. Post-restructuring, the company may receive a fresh inflow of capital, which will enable it to undertake landbanking activities to boost its property development business. The company is making inroads into property development, with its 60 acres of prime land in Bukit Jalil.  According to Kenanga Research, the freehold commercial land is the main driver of Ho Hup\\u2019s future earnings. The company has sole development rights to 10 acres of the tract, while the rest is part of a joint development (JD) between Ho Hup and Malton Bhd. A revised master plan for the JD land, has been submitted for approval. With the revised GDV estimated at more than RM4 billion, compared with RM2.1 billion currently, Ho Hup\\u2019s entitlement may rise to close to RM500 million. \\u201cThe realised net asset value of Ho Hup, could be between RM1.55 and RM2.55 per share, or\\u00a0RM2.05 on average, as the asking prices for land in Bukit Jalil are between RM250 and RM400 psf,\\u201d says Kenanga Research. Ho Hup is trading at a market capitalisation of about RM155 million.  Supermax Corp Bhd Prospects look bright for the glove industry. The weak ringgit is expected to be the tailwind for glove makers, such as Supermax Corp Bhd.  Furthermore, Supermax\\u2019s capacity expansion plans for 2014, could augur well for its earnings, as higher output would help ease its bottleneck.  Taking the new capacity into account, analysts foresee mid-teen earnings growth in the next two years.  Supermax is expecting to commence commercial operations of its two new plants, by the end of 1QFY2014.\\u00a0Given the strong demand for nitrile gloves, the company is seen to be facing a two-month oversold position, according to Kenanga Research. The stock has also seen the re-emergence of Employees Provident Fund as a substantial shareholder, with a 5.5% stake. The glove maker\\u2019s share price has rallied since end-2013, doubling to a three-year high of RM3.01 on Jan 9, before retreating to RM2.85 on Jan 16.  As the stock is trading at 12 times FY2014 earnings, compared with the 15 times of its peer Kossan, analysts expect the valuation gap to narrow with time. \\u201cWe believe (that) the valuation gap will narrow, considering that\\u00a0Supermax\\u2019s capacity and net profits are at levels similar to Kossan\\u2019s,\\u201d said Kenanga Research. Supermax\\u2019s big plans for its Glove City and Supermax Business Park, saw the company cough out RM1.3 billion, over 11 years. The first phase of Glove City, comprising six large plants with a total capacity of 24.6 billion pieces, is expected to be ready in 1HFY2015. An estimated RM95 million was allocated for capital expenditure. Supermax Business Park is expected to be developed in 2HFY2014. The project will be located at a new site, measuring 100 acres. An integrated glove manufacturing complex (IGMC) will take up 60 acres. Capex for the first phase of the IGMC, is expected to be at RM70 million. \\u201cWe are not overly concerned about funding, considering that Supermax has a net gearing of 12% as at Sept 30, 2013, and operating cash flow, which we forecast, will average RM115 million per annum,\\u201d Kenanga Research said in a note. It noted that additional profits from the sale of factories built for the supporting businesses, could be ploughed back into the capex for the IGMC. Tenaga Nasional Bhd Tenaga Nasional Bhd\\u2019s share price has soared, following the tariff hike. The stock shot up close to 21% over a month, hitting an all-time high of RM11.80 on Jan 8. The tariff hike is expected to lift the utility group\\u2019s earnings. On top of that, TNB will no longer need to shoulder any rise in fuel cost, as the government has in place, a fuel pass-through mechanism. Its expenditure will come down substantially, going forward.  Maybank Investment Bank Research says, the market consensus has yet to incorporate the full earnings accretion from the tariff hike, despite the share price rally. It also points out that the reduced earnings risk has not been fully priced in.  Effective Jan 1, the tariff will go up 14.9% in Peninsular Malaysia and 16.9% in Sabah, with the implementation of the incentive-based regulation mechanism. The stock closed at RM11.46 on Jan 16, giving it a market capitalisation of RM64.68 billion. Of the analysts covering the stock, AmResearch has the highest target price of RM14.90. Some may find it pricey, noting that the stock climbed from RM7 level, early last year (2013). However, it is a component stock that is on many watch lists, especially institutional funds, waiting to bargain-hunt on its share price weakness.  AmResearch says that TNB maintains its near-monopoly status in the transmission and distribution of electricity in Peninsular Malaysia, and thus, has a natural advantage in competitive bids for new power generation. This year, the Energy Commission is expected to call a tender for two gas-fired power plants under Track 4A and Track 4B, with a total capacity of 2,000mw. This follows the competitive bid for the RM11 billion Project 3B, for which YTL Power International Bhd has been tipped as the front runner. AmResearch notes that the competitive bidding process to build new power plants, will drive down TNB\\u2019s cost structure. AmResearch estimates TNB\\u2019s net profit to grow to RM4.9 billion, or 87.6 sen per share, for the financial year ending Aug 31, 2014.  Petra Energy Bhd Increasing focus on domestic oil and gas production by enhancing oil recovery, developing small fields and increasing exploration activities to locate new fields, are seen to bode well for Petra Energy Group. The risk service contract (RSC), in which Petra Energy has a 30% stake, and partner,\\u00a0Coastal Energy KBM Sdn Bhd,\\u00a0holds 70% interest, saw its first oil output from the Kapal, Banag and Meranti (KBM) cluster fields. The KBM cluster, operated by Coastal Energy, has been developed since June 2012. The first oil production at the KBM cluster, is a major milestone for the consortium. Some industry players say that this could possibly pave way for it to secure more RSCs in the future.  The stock has been climbing, but it has underperformed, compared with its peers.  Although Petra Energy posted a net loss of RM4.1 million in 3QFY2013 ended Sept 30, analysts remain optimistic, as the company continues to work on a wide range of substantive plans to improve its performance, particularly in the subsea business. The brown field service provider acknowledges that this year is a little slow-moving, but is nonetheless looking ahead to the year\\u2019s final quarter, as it is continuously looking to enhance its capabilities to expand into relevant market sectors. Petra Energy attributes its 3QFY13 loss to lower contribution from its integrated brown field maintenance and engineering services segment. The group saw a 28% y-o-y decline in revenue to RM115 million, from RM159.8 million a year ago. However, this is expected to\\u00a0improve.  Besides development and production from the KBM cluster, the group is eyeing support services that could add to its bottom line. These include maintenance activities, such as marine support and operations. The group\\u2019s order book currently stands at RM3 billion, while the tender book is worth RM1.9 billion. Land & General Bhd With mid-cap property stocks being all the rage recently, Land & General Bhd (L&G) could also be to investors\\u2019 liking, especially with its landbank that is deemed undervalued. L&G had a renounceable rights issue of irredeemable convertible unsecured loan stocks, last year. The stock began to gain momentum, soon after the rights issue, which picked up in December last year. Since then, the stock has risen 27.03%, to close at 47 sen on Jan 16. L&G has been growing its bottom line in double digits, for the past four financial years, save for FY2011. In 9MFY2014 alone, the property developer\\u2019s net profit, more-than-tripled to RM33.52 million, on the back of RM229.96 million in revenue. \\u201cL&G\\u2019s name carries the baggage of its past, as the huge conglomerate was saddled with high debts, during the Asian financial crisis of 1997. This hindered the take-up for its first new launch in 2009 \\u2014 [email\\u00a0protected] Sri Damansara \\u2014 which L&G had to work hard to prove itself,\\u201d said HwangDBS Vickers Research, in a December note. \\u201cDemand for its projects has gradually improved, as seen from the more-than 90% sales for [email\\u00a0protected] and Damansara Foresta Phase 1.\\u201d  The research house says that L&G\\u2019s landbank is grossly undervalued. It adds that the property developer\\u2019s net book value for its landbank for future development, is RM111.8 million. However, the market value for L&G\\u2019s landbank came to a total of RM890.8 million. A prime example would be the Bandar Sri Damansara clubhouse, which had a net book value of RM2 psf, against the market value of RM250 psf. HwangDBS notes that L&G has unbilled sales of RM800 million, which is four times greater than the revenue generated by the company\\u2019s property development segment in FY2013. This does not include its future launches, that have a total gross development value of RM1.5 billion.

The group\\u2019s more cyclical earnings from infrastructure construction, cranes and shipbuilding are complemented by stable concession income from the airports in Cambodia and road maintenance contract in Malaysia. Muhibbah\\u2019s earnings will be underpinned by its RM1.82 billion order book, of which 60% is for oil and gas-related projects. The crane unit, Favelle Favco, in particular is seeing strong growth in order book and earnings, with 30% growth in net profit to RM61.7 million in 2013. We expect Muhibbah to post net profit of RM99.7 million in 2014 and RM110.8 million in 2015, with earnings per share of 23.6 sen for 2014 and 26.2 sen for 2015. At RM2.40, the stock\\u2019s price-earnings ratio of 10.2 times for 2014 and 9.1 times for 2015 are attractive, especially relative to its growth prospects, oil and gas and construction peers, and as lower-cost proxies to the O&G sector. As a comparison, large cap O&G stocks like SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd and Bumi Armada Bhd are currently trading at about 20 times earnings for 2014, while smaller ones like Perisai Petroleum Bhd are at 16 times. Most major construction stocks are trading at around 12 times earnings for 2014 \\u2014 although those with property divisions will likely see a dip in earnings in 2015 with the current property slowdown. 2013 results ahead of expectations Muhibbah\\u2019s full year results for 2013 were better than our expectation, and marked a strong turnaround from 2012 when the company fell into the red due to provisions for the Asia Petroleum Hub (APH) project. Full year pre-tax profit came in at RM134 million, 8% above our forecast of RM124 million, while net profit of RM85.2 million was 20% above our original forecast of RM71.2 million. By comparison, the group posted pre-tax and net losses of RM35 million and RM93.2 million, respectively, in 2012 due to provisions for APH. Revenue for 2013 declined 27.6% from RM2.63 billion to RM1.9 billion. Notwithstanding the better overall performance due to the absence of one-off APH provisions, we estimate earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) in 2013 declined 23.4% from RM236.2 million to RM180.8 million, although overall Ebitda margins improved from 9% to 9.5%. This was largely due to the 27.6% drop in revenue following the completion of several large projects, notably the South Klang Valley Expressway, as civil works typically yield lower margins. Share of associates increased 5.3% from RM44.2 million to RM46.5 million, reflecting continued growth in its concession business, notably the Cambodian airports and Malaysian road maintenance concessions. As at Feb 21, Muhibbah\\u2019s outstanding order book stood at RM1.83 billion, down 14% from RM2.13 billion in November 2013. This comprised RM719 million from infrastructure construction, RM1.064 billion from cranes and RM47 million from shipyard. Of this, 27.7% is in Malaysia and the rest overseas, a testament to the group\\u2019s growing international stature. A first and final dividend of 4.5 sen has been proposed, giving shareholders a yield of 1.9%. Good prospects for more jobs Among Muhibbah\\u2019s major outstanding contracts are the Wiggins Island coal terminal export project in Australia (outstanding order book RM192 million), noise barriers and enclosures for MRT Corp (RM147 million), catering facility for the new Doha International Airport (RM105 million), government buildings in Putrajaya (RM47 million), refurbishment of the terminal buildings at Phnom Penh and Siem Reap airports (RM83 million) and steel structure works for the Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) LNG 9 project in Sarawak (RM30 million). Going forward, O&G projects are likely to feature more with the award to Muhibbah in June 2013 of a licence by Petronas as an approved supplier for offshore facilities construction \\u2014 major onshore fabrication. With its complete package of capabilities in building ships, cranes, fabricated structures, pipelines, terminals, tanks and other related works, the group is positioning itself to garner a larger slice of the national oil company\\u2019s captial expenditure (capex). Petronas is expected to spend RM300 billion in capex over the next five years. For the oil and gas sector in 2014,\\u00a0 the factors that will spur spending include: (i) the award of new risk-sharing contracts; (ii) more enhanced oil recovery projects; (iii) contracts for drilling rigs to local contractors; and (iv) the RM60 billion refinery and petrochemical integrated development (Rapid) petrochemical complex in Pengerang, Johor. There had recently been reports that the Rapid project may not meet its final investment decision deadline of March 2014, although the delay is due more to resettlement issues rather than financial viability. Reflecting Muhibbah\\u2019s increasing global status and its ability to clinch major overseas projects, only 28% of its order book is currently for Malaysian projects. This buffers the company against a slowdown in domestic construction activities where competition and margins have been tight. The group hopes its two projects in the Middle East \\u2014 the earlier completed Yemen LNG project and the ongoing Doha International Airport catering facility \\u2014 will open the doors to more projects in the region. Qatar in particular, is investing heavily in infrastructure. On the APH front, there have been no new developments. Any move to revive or restructure the project will benefit Muhibbah in the future in terms of write-backs, as some RM240 million in full provisions were already made in 2012. Muhibbah\\u2019s Cambodian airport operations offer attractive exposure to Cambodia\\u2019s economy, with gross domestic product growth of 7.2% to 7.5% per year until 2015, supported by the strong tourism and textile industries. The airport operations are 30% owned through a joint venture with the French Vinci group, and the concessions last until 2040. In 2013, the Phnom Penh and Siem Reap airports combined registered 18% growth in total passenger arrivals to 5.07 million, following an already strong 17% growth in arrivals to 4.3 million in 2012. The Phnom Penh airport saw a 15% growth in arrivals to 2.39 million while the Siem Reap airport\\u2019s arrivals rose 20% to 2.66 million. Future growth will come from expansion of the two airports, as well as increased flights at the new third airport concession in Sihanoukville, the gateway to southern Cambodia\\u2019s beaches and islands, textile manufacturing base and newly discovered O&G deposits.

Kaohsiung-based CSC Group (Utilities) general manager, Jack Chen Jung Kuei, said the group sees investment opportunities in Sabah. \"The key is the supply security of the raw materials (biomass), and we think that the Biomass Joint-Venture (JV) Cluster model, will ensure us supply security,\" he said in a meeting with POIC Sabah Sdn Bhd officials. Scheduled to launch in May, the Biomass JV Cluster involves biomass-owning palm oil mill operators coming together in a company, to pledge to supply a fixed amount of biomass. The aggregation of biomass will attract investors in downstream utilisation of the materials. The cluster model is devised by a tripartite collaboration among the Department of Industrial Development & Research, Agensi Inovasi Malaysia and POIC Sabah Sdn Bhd. Chen said, the diversified CSC Group has the know-how to make the POIC Lahad Datu, a globally-attractive industrial park. \"I'm impressed with POIC Lahad Datu, and I think, if it has centralised steam, power supply system and wastewater management services, it will attract even more investors,\" he said. Chen, who was leading a seven-man delegation on a three-day visit to Sabah, said the long-term viability of producing energy from oil palm biomass, in the case of Lahad Datu, can be best served by having natural gas as an additional feedstock. The visit was aimed at exploring opportunities in renewable energy, as part of the company\\u2019s corporate responsibility pledge to reduce its carbon footprint, by among others, producing fuel, pellet stock and bio-coal from biomass. \\u201cBiomass supply and availability can be volatile, so having natural gas as an alternative fuel stock, is reassuring,\\u201d he said in reference to the proposal by national petroleum company, Petronas, to land natural gas in Lahad Datu, by building a re-gasification plant at POIC Lahad Datu. As wastewater management and supplies of industrial gas, power and steam, would always be in demand in an industrial park like POIC Lahad Datu, Chen said that he would propose to his company, the incorporation of these elements, in the same business package with pellet-making. On treatment of palm oil mill effluent (POME) at the 124 palm oil mills in Sabah, Chen said that he would suggest to the CSC group, to explore opportunities in introducing technologies, to help the mills meet discharge standards. While existing mills are given until 2020, to install a POME-trapping system, the system has been mandatory for all new mills, since January this year. \"The steel manufacturing business has a lot of expertise in treating and recycling wastewater, to an acceptable biochemical oxygen demand standard,\" he said. Chen\\u2019s delegation visited POIC Lahad Datu and several palm oil mills in Felda Sahabat and Sawit Kinabalu, and was accompanied by Cheong Siew Hoong, the Sabah Director of the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA). CSC Group, formed in 1971, has its core business in steel making, and is ranked as one of the top 30 steelmakers in the world. It has businesses in engineering, trading, logistics, shipping and industrial materials, with mills in Vietnam, India and Malaysia (in Melaka), and a biomass plant in Penang."}, "959": {"date_posted": "7/3/2014", "title": "#Mid-morning Market* Profit taking halts KLCI advance ", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (March 7): The FBM KLCI remained in negative territory at mid-morning on Friday, and its rally halted by some mild profit taking at select blue chips including Tenaga.

Quah noted that local O&G support-service providers were enjoying record-high order books and strong patronage from Petronas. However, the research house professed to being selective with its O&G stock picks, preferring companies with clear earnings visibility, healthy financials and good track records. \"Malaysian O&G companies are on the cusp of a strong and visible earnings growth trajectory on the back of record-high order books, which will support existing sector valuation,\" Quah said. Quah has maintained HwangDBS' \"buy\" calls for companies like SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd and Bumi Armada Bhd.

For this to happen, more money will have to be invested outside the retirement savings manager\\u2019s conventional staple of government bonds and blue chips, and in relatively riskier assets at home and abroad. Its global assets doubled in the past three years to reach over RM120 billion or 20.97% of total investment assets as at end-2013. The EPF is allowed to invest 23% of its funds outside Malaysia and there is a good chance it will hit this ceiling in 2015, if not this year, say experts. Without going into the specifics of what the new ceiling for overseas investments should be, Shahril, 44, says it will have to \\u201cgradually go up\\u201d to give the fund greater flexibility in its investment options.  \\u201cWhen emerging markets were being sold down in the second half of 2013, our investments in developed markets worked well for us \\u2026 gains there helped provided some buffer,\\u201d he says, explaining how income from the EPF\\u2019s overseas investments is also hedged to protect against currency fluctuations. \\u201cThat\\u2019s one of the many things we do to give us some level of certainty on the amount of returns we generate.\\u201d As for the suspicion that the EPF supports the local stock market, Shahril \\u2014 who had joined the pension fund in December 2009 as deputy CEO in charge of the investments division before assuming the CEO\\u2019s chair last April \\u2014 has this to say: \\u201cThere is no particular level that we think the market should be at \\u2026 For a [large] fund like us, liquidity becomes an issue \\u2026 Managing a RM200 billion fund is very different from managing a RM200 million fund \\u2026 This is why you will often find that we are a buyer when there are many sellers [in the market] and a seller when there are many buyers.\\u201d  While it has a long investment horizon, the EPF constantly evaluates its portfolio to carry the best holdings because it pays dividends annually from realised income, he explains.  \\u201cThis is why if we think there is not much upside left, we will sometimes accept [lower] offers that we think are a decent price for us to exit at because we cannot get that price in the open market,\\u201d Shahril says when asked about the rationale behind the EPF\\u2019s acceptance of Petronas\\u2019 offer for MISC Bhd that some parties saw as low. Shahril: Managing a RM200 billion fund is very different from managing a RM200 million fund. This is why the EPF is a buyer when there are many sellers and a seller when there are many buyers. He probably would not be surprised to face opposition to the EPF putting more money into alternative assets locally and abroad, but prefers to let the results speak for themselves. When the EPF flagged the possibility of lower dividends for 2013 due to global volatility, some critics deemed that to be a result of the EPF being tapped to support the local equity market as foreigners pulled out from emerging markets, including Malaysia.Instead, the EPF on Feb 16 announced another record-high dividend payout \\u2014 6.35% \\u2014 which was the highest since the 6.84% announced in 1999. Still, after five straight years of dividend growth, even those in favour of the EPF\\u2019s investment diversification wonder if the growth can be sustained as global uncertainties persist. To be sure, with the EPF\\u2019s fund size set to exceed the RM600 billion mark this year, its managers are forced to work harder to deliver at least the targeted minimum annual return of 2% above inflation. Total investments had increased from RM341.01 billion as at end-2008 to RM586.66 billion as at end-2013. In line with the growth, to pay 1% dividend to its members, the amount the EPF needs has grown by an average 9.12% a year over the past five years from RM3.18 billion in 2008 to RM4.91 billion in 2013. It only needed RM1.68 billion to do the same a decade ago in 2003, when total investments hovered near the RM200 billion mark. Higher allocation to equitiesA closer look at the EPF\\u2019s asset allocation over the past five years shows a higher proportion of assets is going into equities while additional investments in fixed income, particularly corporate loans and bonds, has been lower. Investments in equities had grown from 25.7% of total investment assets in 2008 to 43% (RM252.14 billion) in 2013, which was up from RM203.9 billion (38.7% of total investments) in 2012 and RM87.9 billion in 2008, data in the EPF\\u2019s annual report shows. By comparison, investments in fixed income (MGS and corporate loans and bonds) had declined to 52.34% in 2013 from 68.25% in 2008, although absolute amounts rose to RM307.1 billion from RM233.4 billion over the period. It should be noted that equities contributed RM19.5 billion or 55.76% to the EPF\\u2019s RM35 billion gross investment income in 2013, up from 34.84% in 2008 when it earned RM6.67 billion. Fixed-income investments contributed 39.19% to total investment income last year compared with 61.17% in 2008. The EPF\\u2019s success in equities, which are seen as higher risk assets than quality fixed-income paper, will likely be closely watched.   As it is, the EPF, ranked the sixth largest pension fund in Asia and the 12th globally by assets under management in 2012 by Tower Watson, is forced to venture abroad so as to not crowd out other local players and to diversify its portfolio. Despite its participation in several high-profile deals \\u2014 from the \\u00a38 billion, 15-year Battersea Power Station redevelopment project with S P Setia Bhd and Sime Darby Bhd to the RM2.28 billion acquisition of Rubber Research Institute land from the government to be turned into the Kwasa Damansara township \\u2014 the EPF has invested only RM14.4 billion in real estate and other alternative assets so far. That\\u2019s only 2.45% of its RM586.7 billion total investments as at end-2013 (see tables below).  As for the EPF\\u2019s real estate portfolio in the UK, Shahril estimates that its value is likely worth 10% to 15% more today based purely on yield compression because the EPF was among the earlier foreign investors in London. \\u201cWhen we started three years ago, we could still get yields of 6%.\\u201d  Now, the EPF is scouting around for opportunities in countries like the US and Japan and is likely to enter markets that it does not know very well with strong partners. \\u201cIn Australia, for instance, we have a strong partner in Goodman Group,\\u201d says Shahril. The EPF is also open to lending its financial muscle for a share of real estate that can provide steady income flow in the future, such as malls or office blocks. Due to the size of the EPF\\u2019s funds, income generation from these projects is likely to remain small relative to its total income base for some time. Nonetheless, the strategy should pay off once some of the larger developments, like Battersea and Kwasa Damansara, where the EPF is targeting a stake in retail and commercial buildings, mature. Whatever the case, more than 90% of its funds is still invested in fixed-income securities and equities and any increase in the money put into alternative assets, including participation in corporate deals such as the privatisation of PLUS Expressways Bhd, KFC Holdings (M) Bhd and Kian Joo Can Factory Bhd, will be opportunistic. \\u201cThere is a lot of attention on these projects because of their physical presence \\u2026 but [even money from land sales] will be small, relatively speaking,\\u201d Shahril points out.  Due to its deep pockets, the EPF gets deal proposals by the dozens, but only a handful that fit in with its investment and risk appetite go through. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve been shareholders of Kian Joo for a long time and we think it is a good business that caters for a diversified client base with steady cash flow,\\u201d says Shahril, explaining the EPF\\u2019s preference for businesses with strong cash-flow generation capability.  According to him, the EPF\\u2019s investment panel has a very high threshold for even staple investments like corporate debt paper because of the need to preserve capital while delivering decent growth.  \\u201cWe hold most of our debt paper to maturity [for yields] \\u2026 we do not buy anything below investment-grade rating,\\u201d he says, adding that even issuers of A-rated paper are evaluated for their cash flow generation capability and gearing position before an investment is made. He declines comment on whether the EPF will take up some of the RM2.4 billion worth of sukuk currently being sold by 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) to fund the relocation of defence units from the land earmarked for the 196ha Bandar Malaysia development project. In the long run, once the EPF builds a strong track record, as much as 50% of its funds could be invested outside Malaysia if that\\u2019s the best option to deliver growth. For now, Shahril knows a lot of work needs to be done to push the EPF higher among global peers, but he is confident the results will show that the pension fund is on the right track. As Chua Hak Bin, economist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, puts it, some of the domestic capital outflow from Malaysia is a \\u201cstructural trend with Malaysians or institutions diversifying their holdings\\u201d. At least three parcels of RRI land up for tender this yearAt least three parcels of the coveted Rubber Research Institute (RRI) land measuring about 130 acres in total will be up for grabs this year, kick-starting the high-profile, 15-year suburban property project that will contribute to the retirement savings of members of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF). \\u201cBased on the response we\\u2019ve seen so far, we think we\\u2019ll get a bit more than the price we\\u2019re looking for,\\u201d says the pension fund\\u2019s CEO Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan, who, however, declines to disclose the floor price of the plots. Tenders will soon be invited for the first parcel of 70 acres, which will house transport infrastructure and facilities, he adds. The other two parcels, one largely for commercial use and the other for residential use, are between 30 acres and 50 acres each.  \\u201cWe want to control the supply of land into the market,\\u201d says Shahril, adding that periodically, smaller plots of land will be put out to tender to allow smaller players to participate. The EPF\\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary Kwasa Land Sdn Bhd is the master developer of the 2,330-acre RRI land, which will be developed into a township called Kwasa Damansara that will be bigger than Subang Jaya (1,799 acres) and is expected to generate projects worth RM50 billion in gross development value (GDV). Kwasa Land, which reportedly expects to raise RM11 billion from selling 1,350 acres of the RRI land, will take equity in most of the eight precincts available for development. The equity participation will go towards building future income for the EPF. As many as 60 developers have reportedly been pre-qualified for the upcoming tender. Events are already in motion.  In late January this year, Kwasa Land sold two parcels in Sungai Buloh \\u2014 in the vicinity of Kwasa Damansara \\u2014 to Pink Corner Sdn Bhd and TRC Land Sdn Bhd, who were the highest bidders for the parcels that are said to be at \\u201cjust a stone\\u2019s throw from the main township development separated by Jalan Lapangan Terbang Subang\\u201d. Pink Corner paid RM13.07 million or RM70 psf for a 4.28-acre plot while TRC Land paid RM6.13 million or RM82 psf for a 1.717-acre plot. The parcels were tendered on an \\u201cas is, where is\\u201d basis based on agricultural titles, according to a statement by Kwasa Land. Both parcels were sold at 13% and 11% above the reserve price respectively. A total of nine bidders participated in the bids for the parcels that were advertised for sale to bumiputeras only in August 2013.  According to Shahril, more small parcels will be made available for tender in the future to allow a broader group of developers to participate in the development.  This story first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly Edition, on February 24 - March 2, 2014."}, "973": {"date_posted": "28/2/2014", "title": "#Highlight* A challenge for EPF to maintain high returns", "article": " THE EMPLOYEES PROVIDENT FUND (EPF) expects to see at least 10% of its income come from \\u201calternative assets\\u201d, such as real estate and private equity deals, over the next decade to help it continue to deliver good returns on its growing pool of funds, says CEO Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan. For this to happen, more money will have to be invested outside the retirement savings manager\\u2019s conventional staple of government bonds and blue chips, and in relatively riskier assets at home and abroad. Its global assets doubled in the past three years to reach over RM120 billion or 20.97% of total investment assets as at end-2013. The EPF is allowed to invest 23% of its funds outside Malaysia and there is a good chance it will hit this ceiling in 2015, if not this year, say experts. Without going into the specifics of what the new ceiling for overseas investments should be, Shahril, 44, says it will have to \\u201cgradually go up\\u201d to give the fund greater flexibility in its investment options.  \\u201cWhen emerging markets were being sold down in the second half of 2013, our investments in developed markets worked well for us \\u2026 gains there helped provided some buffer,\\u201d he says, explaining how income from the EPF\\u2019s overseas investments is also hedged to protect against currency fluctuations. \\u201cThat\\u2019s one of the many things we do to give us some level of certainty on the amount of returns we generate.\\u201d As for the suspicion that the EPF supports the local stock market, Shahril \\u2014 who had joined the pension fund in December 2009 as deputy CEO in charge of the investments division before assuming the CEO\\u2019s chair last April \\u2014 has this to say: \\u201cThere is no particular level that we think the market should be at \\u2026 For a [large] fund like us, liquidity becomes an issue \\u2026 Managing a RM200 billion fund is very different from managing a RM200 million fund \\u2026 This is why you will often find that we are a buyer when there are many sellers [in the market] and a seller when there are many buyers.\\u201d  While it has a long investment horizon, the EPF constantly evaluates its portfolio to carry the best holdings because it pays dividends annually from realised income, he explains.  \\u201cThis is why if we think there is not much upside left, we will sometimes accept [lower] offers that we think are a decent price for us to exit at because we cannot get that price in the open market,\\u201d Shahril says when asked about the rationale behind the EPF\\u2019s acceptance of Petronas\\u2019 offer for MISC Bhd that some parties saw as low. Shahril: Managing a RM200 billion fund is very different from managing a RM200 million fund. This is why the EPF is a buyer when there are many sellers and a seller when there are many buyers. He probably would not be surprised to face opposition to the EPF putting more money into alternative assets locally and abroad, but prefers to let the results speak for themselves. When the EPF flagged the possibility of lower dividends for 2013 due to global volatility, some critics deemed that to be a result of the EPF being tapped to support the local equity market as foreigners pulled out from emerging markets, including Malaysia.Instead, the EPF on Feb 16 announced another record-high dividend payout \\u2014 6.35% \\u2014 which was the highest since the 6.84% announced in 1999. Still, after five straight years of dividend growth, even those in favour of the EPF\\u2019s investment diversification wonder if the growth can be sustained as global uncertainties persist. To be sure, with the EPF\\u2019s fund size set to exceed the RM600 billion mark this year, its managers are forced to work harder to deliver at least the targeted minimum annual return of 2% above inflation. Total investments had increased from RM341.01 billion as at end-2008 to RM586.66 billion as at end-2013. In line with the growth, to pay 1% dividend to its members, the amount the EPF needs has grown by an average 9.12% a year over the past five years from RM3.18 billion in 2008 to RM4.91 billion in 2013. It only needed RM1.68 billion to do the same a decade ago in 2003, when total investments hovered near the RM200 billion mark. Higher allocation to equitiesA closer look at the EPF\\u2019s asset allocation over the past five years shows a higher proportion of assets is going into equities while additional investments in fixed income, particularly corporate loans and bonds, has been lower. Investments in equities had grown from 25.7% of total investment assets in 2008 to 43% (RM252.14 billion) in 2013, which was up from RM203.9 billion (38.7% of total investments) in 2012 and RM87.9 billion in 2008, data in the EPF\\u2019s annual report shows. By comparison, investments in fixed income (MGS and corporate loans and bonds) had declined to 52.34% in 2013 from 68.25% in 2008, although absolute amounts rose to RM307.1 billion from RM233.4 billion over the period. It should be noted that equities contributed RM19.5 billion or 55.76% to the EPF\\u2019s RM35 billion gross investment income in 2013, up from 34.84% in 2008 when it earned RM6.67 billion. Fixed-income investments contributed 39.19% to total investment income last year compared with 61.17% in 2008. The EPF\\u2019s success in equities, which are seen as higher risk assets than quality fixed-income paper, will likely be closely watched.   As it is, the EPF, ranked the sixth largest pension fund in Asia and the 12th globally by assets under management in 2012 by Tower Watson, is forced to venture abroad so as to not crowd out other local players and to diversify its portfolio. Despite its participation in several high-profile deals \\u2014 from the \\u00a38 billion, 15-year Battersea Power Station redevelopment project with S P Setia Bhd and Sime Darby Bhd to the RM2.28 billion acquisition of Rubber Research Institute land from the government to be turned into the Kwasa Damansara township \\u2014 the EPF has invested only RM14.4 billion in real estate and other alternative assets so far. That\\u2019s only 2.45% of its RM586.7 billion total investments as at end-2013 (see tables below).  As for the EPF\\u2019s real estate portfolio in the UK, Shahril estimates that its value is likely worth 10% to 15% more today based purely on yield compression because the EPF was among the earlier foreign investors in London. \\u201cWhen we started three years ago, we could still get yields of 6%.\\u201d  Now, the EPF is scouting around for opportunities in countries like the US and Japan and is likely to enter markets that it does not know very well with strong partners. \\u201cIn Australia, for instance, we have a strong partner in Goodman Group,\\u201d says Shahril. The EPF is also open to lending its financial muscle for a share of real estate that can provide steady income flow in the future, such as malls or office blocks. Due to the size of the EPF\\u2019s funds, income generation from these projects is likely to remain small relative to its total income base for some time. Nonetheless, the strategy should pay off once some of the larger developments, like Battersea and Kwasa Damansara, where the EPF is targeting a stake in retail and commercial buildings, mature. Whatever the case, more than 90% of its funds is still invested in fixed-income securities and equities and any increase in the money put into alternative assets, including participation in corporate deals such as the privatisation of PLUS Expressways Bhd, KFC Holdings (M) Bhd and Kian Joo Can Factory Bhd, will be opportunistic. \\u201cThere is a lot of attention on these projects because of their physical presence \\u2026 but [even money from land sales] will be small, relatively speaking,\\u201d Shahril points out.  Due to its deep pockets, the EPF gets deal proposals by the dozens, but only a handful that fit in with its investment and risk appetite go through. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve been shareholders of Kian Joo for a long time and we think it is a good business that caters for a diversified client base with steady cash flow,\\u201d says Shahril, explaining the EPF\\u2019s preference for businesses with strong cash-flow generation capability.  According to him, the EPF\\u2019s investment panel has a very high threshold for even staple investments like corporate debt paper because of the need to preserve capital while delivering decent growth.  \\u201cWe hold most of our debt paper to maturity [for yields] \\u2026 we do not buy anything below investment-grade rating,\\u201d he says, adding that even issuers of A-rated paper are evaluated for their cash flow generation capability and gearing position before an investment is made. He declines comment on whether the EPF will take up some of the RM2.4 billion worth of sukuk currently being sold by 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) to fund the relocation of defence units from the land earmarked for the 196ha Bandar Malaysia development project. In the long run, once the EPF builds a strong track record, as much as 50% of its funds could be invested outside Malaysia if that\\u2019s the best option to deliver growth. For now, Shahril knows a lot of work needs to be done to push the EPF higher among global peers, but he is confident the results will show that the pension fund is on the right track. As Chua Hak Bin, economist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, puts it, some of the domestic capital outflow from Malaysia is a \\u201cstructural trend with Malaysians or institutions diversifying their holdings\\u201d.

Nonetheless, the stock is still a \\u201cbuy\\u201d, as its appealing 6.6% to 6.9% annual yield, makes it the most attractive dividend play under our gaming coverage. Our discounted cash flow-based fair value, now stands at RM4.46 (from RM5.01), following a revision in our earnings forecasts and weighted average cost of capital assumptions. BToto commands an estimated 41% share of the NFO market, vis-\\u00e0-vis Magnum Bhd\\u2019s 35% share. We believe that BToto\\u2019s niche as the only NFO offering lotto games, puts it in a position of strength, compared with other NFOs, whose traditional 4D games are facing competition from illegal operators. The company\\u2019s move to call off its listing, may have been a blessing in disguise, as the proposal would have eventually diluted BToto\\u2019s interest in the NFO, to 28.7% (from 100%), which would then subject BToto to a holding company discount, due to the loss of a directly-owned business. Perdana Petroleum BhdTarget price: RM2 ADD CIMB RESEARCH (Dec 26): Perdana has taken delivery of its 16th vessel, which will be deployed to Dayang on a long-term job, wrapping up a year of exceptional turnaround, following several washout years. Keep an eye on this company, as it takes on more deliveries in 2014. We continue to value the stock at a 2015 PER of 15.8 times, applying a 30% discount to the average PER of the oil and gas big caps. The stronger earnings uptick expected in FY14, is the potential re-rating catalyst that supports our \\u201cadd\\u201d call. We are encouraged that Perdana\\u2019s fleet expansion programme is on track. The operating environment in the marine support space, has been very conducive, with improvement in both charter and utilisation rates. Perdana currently fetches a charter rate of around US$2 per horsepower, for a 5,000-horsepower anchor handling tug supply vessel \\u2014 higher than the US$1.50 to US$1.80, netted in 2012.  Meanwhile, the company\\u2019s utilisation rate shot up to a robust 83% in 3Q13, from an estimated 74% in 3Q12. Malaysia Airports Holdings BhdTarget price: RM7.63 NEUTRAL MIDF RESEARCH (Dec 24): MAHB exercised its right of first refusal to acquire construction conglomerate GMR\\u2019s 40% stake in the two companies that operate the Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen (ISG) airport, and the hotel, retail outlets and lounge services (LGM). GMR is one of MAHB\\u2019s joint-venture partners. The acquisition will be settled via a total cash consideration of \\u20ac225 million (equivalent to RM1 billion). The successful deal is expected to lift MAHB\\u2019s stake in ISG airport, from 20% to 60%, while the remaining 40% shareholding is still held by Limak Holdings. The EV/Ebitda multiple of the ISG and LGM transactions, are calculated at 15 times. Based on comparable airports acquisition in Europe, in the past eight years, the EV/Ebitda multiple was transacted in the range of 9 to 35 times, with an average of 19.6 times.  While ISG airport is still loss-making, albeit blessed with good traffic growth factor, we view that the transaction is within the mid-range of the EV/Ebitda multiple, and fair in terms of valuation.BIMB Holdings BhdTarget price: RM4.80 BUY MAYBANK IB RESEARCH (Dec 23): We are positive on the price that BIMB has paid for the remaining 49% stake in Bank Islam, which translates into a decent September price-to-book value of 1.8 times, for a bank that offers return on equities of 15% to 16%. The deal is EPS accretive, by 10% to 11%. Fundamentals remain intact and we project a strong two-year EPS CAGR of 29%, due in part to earnings accretion from the recent corporate move. With the recent weakness in the share price, we take this opportunity to raise our call to a \\u201cbuy\\u201d. BIMB\\u2019s net profit is upped 53% to 56% for FY14 and FY15, with expectations that Bank Islam will account for 88% of group pre-tax profit in FY14. EPS accretion is projected to be a lower 10% to 11%, due to the dilutive impact of the rights issue, which contributed to a 40% enlargement in share capital.  Overall, we are positive on BIMB\\u2019s prospects. We forecast above-industry financing growth of 16% in FY14 (against the industry\\u2019s 9% to 10%). IJM Corp BhdTarget price: RM6.75 BUY MAYBANK IB RESEARCH (Dec 24): IJM\\u2019s 38.4% West Coast Expressway concession has met all conditions and construction can commence, after the government gave its approval on Dec 23, 2013. This is positive for IJM, which is eyeing a significant portion of the works available, potentially boosting its outstanding order book to RM6 billion, from RM2.5 billion. We, however, maintain our earnings forecasts for now, pending the actual award of works. IJM remains as our top \\u201cbuy\\u201d in construction. IJM has a direct 20% stake in West Coast Expressway Sdn Bhd (WCESB). Together with its stake in Kumpulan Europlus, IJM has an effective 38.4% stake in WCESB. Our estimate is for the concession to enhance IJM\\u2019s valuations by RM100 million, or 7.8 sen per share, assuming 10% project internal rate of return. IJM hopes to win 70% of the RM5 billion WCE work packages, translating into RM3.5 billion. This would significantly boost its outstanding order book, which stood at RM2.5 billion as at end-September 2013, after winning RM538 million, year-to-date. Gamuda BhdTarget price: RM5.25 OUTPERFORM KENANGA RESEARCH (Dec 24): Just a few days after the deadline for the remaining Kesas shareholders\\u2019 acceptance (of which only Amcorp Properties Bhd accepted), Gamuda has made fresh offers to the Kesas shareholders, that had rejected the earlier offer, namely Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB, 20% stake) and Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Selangor (PKNS, 30% stake). Gamuda increased the offer price by 12% to RM280 million and RM420 million, for PNB and PKNS respectively. Gamuda is also increasing Amcorp\\u2019s offer value to RM280 million. Altogether, Gamuda\\u2019s offer price for the 70% stake in Kesas, is RM980 million (RM1.4 billion for 100% stake). We are of the view that the 12% increase in the offer price, is still fair, judging from the valuation of normalised PER of 12 times (average net profit of RM120 million) against its peer, Litrak Holdings\\u2019 17 times. It is also still below our valuation for Kesas Holdings, at RM1.63 billion. We believe that Gamuda\\u2019s strong fundamentals have yet to be fully-priced in its share price.  Malaysian Resources Corp BhdTarget price: RM2.06 BUY HLIB RESEARCH (Dec 24): MRCB has entered into an agreement with Arch Angel DMC Sdn Bhd (AADMC), to acquire a 70% stake in Arch Angel Capital Sdn Bhd (AAC) for RM34 million. The offer price consists of: 1) RM2.5 million for shares in AAC from AADMC; 2) RM1.5 million for new shares in AAC; and 3) RM30 million for redeemable convertible preference shares in AAC. AAC has entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Putrajaya Holdings, for a 1.84-acre freehold parcel, known as Plot 2C4, Precinct 2, Putrajaya. The acquisition has yet to be completed. We understand that the proposed development is for a 13-storey commercial building, with a potential GDV of RM300 million to RM400 million. We are positive on the move to diversify from KL Sentral, for development profits. However, the deal will only be meaningful, if the development can be monetised quickly. Based on 3QFY13 numbers, MRCB has a cash pile of RM473.8 million, and total debt/sukuk of RM3.4 billion. Hence, this acquisition has minimal impact on its balance sheet.Datasonic Group BhdFair value: RM2.58 BUY RHB RESEARCH (Dec 23): Datasonic\\u2019s share price went \\u201cex\\u201d on Dec 23, 2013, following the completion of its 1-to-5 share split. With that, we foresee improvements in its trading liquidity. We believe FY13 earnings could surpass our RM80.8 million full-year estimate, with dividend surprise, likely on the cards. Maintain \\u201cbuy\\u201d with our fair value increased to RM2.58 (from RM2.36), as we ascribe a higher forecast FY14 target PER of 18 times. Datasonic\\u2019s daily traded volume averaged at 500,000 shares over the last two months, compared with 200,000, prior to our initiation. The completion of the share split exercise will boost its outstanding share base to 675 million (from 135 million).  This, in our view, could entice participation from retail investors and improve trading liquidity, over the near-to-medium term. We believe that its FY13 earnings, due to be released by mid-February 2014 (at the time of writing), could potentially surpass our full-year estimate of RM80.8 million. We gather that improvements in overall profitability, are likely on higher economies of scale, given that both its MyKad and passport contracts have gained further traction in 4Q13.Tenaga Nasional BhdTarget price: RM12.29 ADD CIMB RESEARCH (Dec 23): We have gathered that: 1) future tariff reviews after six months, remain very much the government\\u2019s prerogative; 2) piped gas prices from Petronas could be raised again, assuming there is another round of tariff hike, after six months; and 3) Tenaga\\u2019s return on assets (ROA) is expected to match its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) by 2017.  The clarification with regards to the tariff hike provides investors with more comfort for Tenaga\\u2019s outlook, moving forward. The base tariff hike would improve Tenaga\\u2019s ROA, to match its WACC by 2017, thus implying that it would drive earnings higher, to a certain extent. Although fuel costs remain a concern, we believe that they would not leave Tenaga worse off, in the longer run. Our target price is unchanged at RM12.29, based on 12.6 times FY15 EPS, in line with its historical five-year average PER. We maintain our \\u201cadd\\u201d rating. Rerating catalysts include improved earnings for FY14 to FY17, arising from the base tariff hike that is expected to increase Tenaga\\u2019s ROA. MKH BhdFair value: RM3.05 TRADING BUY KENANGA RESEARCH (Dec 26): MKH is a fundamentally strong property developer with a solid 19-year track record of profitability since its listing in 1995.We gather that most of MKH\\u2019s housing projects are located in Kajang and they mainly offer affordable units priced below RM600,000 per unit. This should place MKH in a good position as we believe developers with significant exposure to affordable housing should fare better under the current economic scenario. MKH\\u2019s FY13 core net profit surged 60% y-o-y to RM123 million. This was mainly due to the strong performance from its property development and construction division in which PBT jumped 69% y-o-y to RM143 million. The plantation division\\u2019s core PBT also increased to RM24 million (from last year\\u2019s RM5 million). We have excluded the impact of unrealised forex loss and a gain on asset disposal (RM31 million) in the plantation division. Our fair value of RM3.05 is based on a 35% discount to our SOP RNAV of RM4.69, implying 1.02 times price-to-book value on FY14E book value per share of RM3 or 7.1 times FY14E PER.Bumi Armada BhdTarget price: RM4.43 TRADING BUY ALLIANCE RESEARCH (Dec 24): Bumi Armada has formalised its contract with Enquest, to supply the Kraken floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel. The contract is worth RM4.6 billion and covers the bareboat charter, as well as the operation and maintenance of the FPSO vessel, for a fixed period of eight years, with 17 yearly optional extensions. The contract value is within our estimates.  FY14 is looking to be a good year for Bumi Armada, with a potential for more news flow on another FPSO contract in Indonesia. We maintain our \\u201ctrading buy\\u201d recommendation, given that the long-awaited FPSO contracts are finally starting to materialise. There could be some upside from FY16 onwards, from the commencement of operational and maintenance (O&M) works. However, values tend to vary for O&M works, as they depend on the work volume, which may be minimal in the early years of an FPSO vessel\\u2019s operations. Based on our observation of other FPSO contracts, O&M work can sometimes not be profitable. We make no changes to our estimates, at this juncture.Tambun Indah Land BhdFair value: RM2.08 BUY RHB RESEARCH (Dec 26): Tambun Indah has entered into an agreement with GEMS Maju Sdn Bhd, to construct a campus on an eight-acre site, and thereafter, lease it to the latter for 30 years. While the construction of Phase 1, will cost Tambun Indah RM38 million, GEMS Maju will invest another RM32 million for the campus fittings. Phase 1 will have a built-up area of 200,000 sq ft, and according to the management, the rental for the first eight years is fixed at 8% of the construction costs, plus 4% of the land value.  From the ninth year onwards, there will be a step up of 2% annually. This translates into about RM3.5 million per annum, or an attractive 7% yield, based on the net market value of RM35 psf, after a RM5 psf discount for the land. We make no changes to our forecast.

Global\nequity markets mostly rose and the dollar traded mixed on Friday as recent data\nthat has underpinned hopes for sustained U.S. economic growth offset new data\nshowing home resales fell to an 18-month low last month, according to Reuters.  Cold\nweather and a lack of housing stock sidelined potential home buyers in January,\nthe National Association of Realtors said on Friday, in the latest report\nindicating severe winter weather has dragged on economic growth, it said.  Affin IB vice president and head of retail research Dr Nazri\nKhan said that going forward he expects firmer market action after the local\nstock market advanced for the fourth straight week (gaining a total of 59\npoints or 3.3% since 4th February 2014).  He said the FBM KLCI should resume its upward path as bulls\ntook heart from reduced prospects for a shift in Fed's tapering bias,\nrecovering USA economy (positive report on US manufacturing activity which are\nthe highest since May 2010), rising commodity prices and the unexpected\nliquidity boost from the Bank of Japan.  \\u201cThe fact that FBM KLCI scored a sizeable monthly gain in\nFebruary despite signs of weakness in the Chinese economy shows near term\nrelative strength,\\u201d he said.  Nazri said there were re also signs of global commodity\nmaking a comeback.  He said the catapult seen in commodities was likely to spill\nover to local resource stocks (oil gas and plantation) benefitting Bursa and the\nFBM KCLI.  \\u201cGiven the bullish commodity seasonalities of March-June and\nthe FBM KLCI registering the fourth consecutive up weeks, we see higher\nprobabilities for deeper upside, following a strong momentum by the local\nmarket over the past year (FBM KLCI has gained 10.1% since January 2013, 39.5%\nsince September 2011 and 128.1% since October 2008).  \\u201cOn the external front, we see a wave of bullishness\nsweeping through global markets on optimism that politicians in Washington finally\ndo earlier-than-expected debt deal breakthrough,\\u201d he said.  Nazri said that on the technical front, the near term bias\nhad turned in favour of the bull camp with immediate support pegged near 1,800\nand 1,780 levels while resistance spotted near 1,830 followed by 1,850 levels.  He said weekly market breadth remained positive with gainers\nedging losers 3.8 to 3 on impressive average daily trade totalling 2.8 billion\nshares worth RM2.4 billion.  The fact that FBM KLCI has broken above 1,800 psycho level\nand all key moving average (20, 50 and 200) with record volume (3.6 billion\nshares on Monday 17th\\u00a0Feb) may suggest stronger bulls ahead.  Nazri said that from the intermarket analysis perspective,\nthe stronger leadership by economically-sensitive groups (Oil Gas,\nConstruction, Technology & Properties) and stronger gain from smaller cap\nstocks (FBMSmallCap & FBMAce) suggest healthy momentum in the near term.  Finally, on the domestic front, the upcoming Pengerang\nETP-Petronas projects (worth RM60 billion) and the impending launching of 2014\nbiggest mega IPO namely 1MDB Berhad (raising RM10 billion) should be market\npositive, he said.  \\u201cWe expect the two catalyst to raise foreign investors\ninterest, attract more Bursa foreign inflows and spur oil gas, power and\nproperties sectors,\\u201d he said.  Nazri said while local blue chips consolidate with buoying\nsentiment, impressive rotational interest on local small caps should showcase\nhealthy risk taking with active retail participation accumulating penny stocks\nsuch as Iris, Sona, Daya, ManagePay, Tadmax, Asiapac and THHeavy.  He said that strategy wise, given that the short term trend\nhad turned positive toward 1,850, traders should accumulate and capitalize on\nweaker dollar and ride on upturns in economically-sensitive sectors.  \\u201cWhile conservative investors may buy our roadshow Ten\nFeatured Stocks i.e. Coastal, Yinson, Takaful, Jobstreet, Metro Kajang Holding,\nInari, Uzma, THHeavy and Tambun, aggressive bulls might consider buying index\nfutures on dips toward 1,800, positioning for a larger jump to all time high of\n1,877,\\u201d he said.  \\u00a0"}, "980": {"date_posted": "21/2/2014", "title": "Highlight: Blue skies ahead for Perwaja and Kinsteel?", "article": " PERWAJA HOLDINGS BHD and its controlling shareholder, Kinsteel Bhd, can now see light at the end of the tunnel after the former reached an agreement to settle a gas bill of RM275.77 million with national oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas).

The financial results, which were released last Thursday, surpassed analyst expectations and prompted a slew of earnings forecast and target price upgrades. A Bloomberg poll of at least 13 analysts shows that target prices for the stock now range from RM6.20 to RM8.20. These are far above the RM5.50 that was Petronas\\u2019 best offer and prove that the minorities were indeed right in betting that there was more value in MISC than what its parent company Petronas was willing to offer at the time. Over the last year, MISC\\u2019s shares reached a high of RM6.50 and closed at RM6.39 last Friday. Petronas had painted a bleak picture of the shipping industry back then. It had wanted to take MISC private in order to have more flexibility in deciding the company\\u2019s strategic direction amid the challenging outlook. But MISC\\u2019s latest results are encouraging. Net profit for FY2013 surged about 171% to RM2.08 billion, accounting for 117% of consensus forecast, despite a marginal drop in revenue to RM8.97 billion.  While the improvement in profit was largely due to lower impairment losses and a one-time gain on asset disposal, the takeaway for analysts was that MISC\\u2019s shipping losses were narrowing.  The minority shareholders of Hong Leong Capital Bhd (HLCap) should also be feeling good about having rejected a takeover offer of RM1.71 a share from business tycoon Tan Sri Quek Leng Chan\\u2019s Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd last February.  A year on, HLCap is averaging over RM6 a day on the stock exchange and peaked at RM14 last month. The shares closed at RM10.04 last Friday.

Winners were selected from the 95 recommendations, submitted for consideration. Number crunchers would know that some houses submitted more than six calls.  Each submission is already a winner in the eyes of its respective head of research, who were each invited to submit five best calls, plus an additional nomination for best discovery. We cannot feature all of them here, due to the lack of space. We chose to acknowledge two winners from year 2012, as they continued to be right in 2013 and the relative quantum of stock gains, warranted the acknowledgement. For our part, The Edge Best Call Awards is meant to recognise good fundamental analysis, in the hope of spurring continued excellence and the unearthing of new gems. It is not meant to be a measure of performance or a determinant of one\\u2019s bonus, and it is certainly not meant to be a glory box.  Humility is one trait that winners should never forget. And like any true gem, their worth will ultimately be acknowledged, given time.  Here are year 2013\\u2019s winners, in no particular order. Congratulations again to the winners. To the gems who did not make the cut in year 2013, keep up the good work and all the best for year 2014. RHB Research Institute analyst Kong Heng Siong and Public Investment Bank Research analyst Chong Hoe Leong\\u2019s call on Prestariang Bhd In year 2012, Kong Heng Siong was acknowledged for showing investors an entry price into Prestariang Bhd, that was 44% lower than its 90 sen initial public offering (IPO) price. In fact, when he said that it was time to buy on Sept 29, 2011, Prestariang was near its all-time low of 49 sen. Highlighting its 50% payout policy, he said that dividend yields were at least 10%. The stock rocketed 172%, within 10 months. On Jan 8, 2013, when prices were at RM1.16, Kong told clients that Prestariang should be worth a buck more. Those who followed, would have more-than-doubled their money, as the stock gained as much as 152% to RM2.85 apiece, on Dec 13. At the time of writing, there was still another 18% upside potential to his RM3.37 price target, with 4.2% potential yield, going by his FY2014 dividend forecast of 12 sen apiece. \\u201cWe anticipate a slew of oil and gas contracts, to catalyse a re-rating of its shares,\\u201d he wrote of the company that provides IT-related training and certification.  Kong\\u2019s price target is the highest among three analysts tracking the stock, Bloomberg data shows. The most conservative is Public Investment Bank Research\\u2019s Chong Hoe Leong, who receives special mention, because those that bought Prestariang when he initiated coverage with a \\u201cbuy\\u201d in mid-August 2012, would have seen gains of as much as 149% at its peak. Chong has since cut Prestariang to \\u201cneutral\\u201d, with a price target at RM2.47. Only time will tell as to who will be proved right. Maybank Investment Bank Research analyst Ong Chee Ting\\u2019s call on Genting Plantations Bhd Plantation stocks saw lacklustre trading for most of 2013, as high crude palm oil inventory levels weighed on prices. Ong Chee Ting, however, breathed new life into Genting Plantations Bhd, by recasting the stock as an Iskandar Development play. In a March 6, 2013 note, he told clients that Genting Plantations\\u2019 RM6.4 billion market capitalisation, \\u201chas merely priced in its growing palm oil assets\\u201d. \\u201cWhat investors overlooked is Genting Plantations\\u2019 some 6,600 acres of prime landbank, worth RM4 billion, in Iskandar and Sepang,\\u201d he said, telling clients that at RM8.50 levels, they were getting the Iskandar landbank for free.  Raising his recommendation to a \\u201cbuy\\u201d and price target from RM8 to RM10.30, he said that there was already a 20% discount to the RM13 apiece that he had calculated the assets to be worth.  Genting Plantations rose as much as 33.6% to RM11.53 apiece on Nov 18, 2013, gaining as much as RM2.2 billion in market cap, before the latest round of property cooling measures doused investor confidence.  At the time of writing, Genting Plantations\\u2019 market cap was at RM8.3 billion, with its share price closing at RM10.94 on Dec 16, 2013. When Ong cut his call to \\u201chold\\u201d on Nov 19, with a RM10.10 target price, the stock was going for RM11.20 apiece. Now, he has a RM10.90 target price, just above consensus valuations that range from RM9.40 to RM14.05 apiece.TA Research analyst Mohlini Narayanan\\u2019s call on Scientex Bhd Some good things in life do come free. It would seem that Mohlini Narayanan\\u2019s recommendation on Scientex Bhd, is one such instance, at least for the most of 2013. Covering the stock for TA Research under the Capital Market Development Fund-Bursa Research Scheme \\u2014 aimed at raising the profile of small and mid-sized companies, while encouraging informed investment decisions among retail investors \\u2014 those who paid attention when Mohlini said that there was some 20.8% upside potential to the stock, stood to double their investments as the stock climbed 98% from RM2.93 on Dec 20, 2012, to as high as RM5.78, on Nov 4, 2013. Will she continue to be right, going into 2014? On Nov 12, 2013, she upgraded her recommendation to a \\u201cbuy\\u201d. Her target price was raised from RM5.97 to RM6.47 apiece, even as she lifted the price-earnings ratio (PER) to 10 times, from 8 times, after taking into consideration Daibochi Plastic and Packaging Industry Bhd\\u2019s 16.2 times, and Tomypak Holdings Bhd\\u2019s 10 times PER.  The upgrade also came as Scientex proposed to buy food packaging-maker, Seacera Polyfilms Sdn Bhd, for RM40 million \\u2014 a deal she expects to only lift FY2014 earnings by 1.1%, but could raise gearing to 0.31 times. Her price target is the most bullish among four analysts polled on Bloomberg, all of whom were calling a \\u201cbuy\\u201d. HwangDBS Vickers Research analysts Kevin Wong and Chong Tjen-San on Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd was first featured in The Edge Best Call Awards in 2006, as the year\\u2019s best discovery, by Asia Analytica Sdn Bhd\\u2019s Kevin Khoo, who was the first to issue an extensive report in September 2005. Muhibbah, which started 2006 near 20 sen levels, reached RM3.50 levels by July 2007. By October 2008, however, the stock had fallen to 60 sen levels and largely hovered around the RM1 levels, until early 2013. On March 27, 2013, HwangDBS analysts Kevin Wong and Chong Tjen-San, reintroduced the niche marine, and oil and gas contractor \\u2014 which also makes cranes and ships, as well as takes on civil engineering jobs \\u2014 to investors.  \\u201cWith an increasingly-crowded civil infrastructure space, we think that this spread of business differentiates Muhibbah from the average contractor,\\u201d they said, when initiating coverage with a RM2.15 target price. At the time, the company \\u2014 which stood to benefit from a new wave of Petronas offshore service vessel contracts \\u2014 was also among those shortlisted for Myanmar\\u2019s Mandalay International Airport concession. From RM1.18 apiece, Muhibbah jumped 130% to reach RM2.72, on July 27, 2013. Even at RM2.33 on Dec 16, 2013, the stock has appreciated 97%, since coverage was initiated. Although this is smaller than its 182% gain year-to-date, it is still a great comeback story. Now, the analysts value Muhibbah at RM3.10 apiece. Will they continue to be right?BIMB Research analyst Law Mei Chi\\u2019s call on Tambun Indah Land Bhd To be sure, BIMB\\u2019s Law Mei Chi wasn\\u2019t the earliest to discover Tambun Indah Land Bhd \\u2014 a niche property developer that saw its share price jump in year 2013, as investors began looking for value in the small and mid-cap space. She was also not the most bullish, among analysts polled on Bloomberg. However, hers was the best among submissions received for consideration, when it came to recommendations in the alternative real estate developer space. Investors who paid attention when Law said Butterworth-based Tambun Indah should be worth as much as 34% more, based on what its assets and landbank were worth, stood to benefit as the stock rose 70%, from 89 sen on April 2, 2013, to as high as RM1.51 on Aug 19. She had a price target of RM1.70 at the time of writing, implying just over 20% upside, for the company that she reckons will see spillover benefits from the investments going into Penang, and improved accessibility via the Penang second link. BIMB Securities Research analyst Chiong Tong Chai and Hong Leong Investment Bank analyst Low Yee Huap\\u2019s calls on Uzma Bhd Uzma Bhd may not be a big name among oil and gas counters, but with its stock up over 200% in year 2013, it is one of those counters that with hindsight, many would kick themselves for not buying. Part of the gains was spurred by investors\\u2019 gravitation towards the esoteric oil and gas business in 2013. It is due to the quantum of the gains that BIMB Securities Research\\u2019s Chiong Tong Chai and Hong Leong Investment Bank\\u2019s (HLIB) Low Yee Huap, both merit notable mentions. BIMB, which started covering Uzma in 2011, has the stock as its top pick in year 2013.  HLIB too, began covering the company, ahead of its rally in 2013. As The Edge Best Call Awards usually go to new calls made during the year, both recommendations would not normally have made the list, as they are not entirely new. The decision to make an exception, took into consideration that some calls will take time to be proved right, and investors who took action should be laughing all the way to the bank. Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u2019s strategy to enhance oil recovery on existing and new oilfields augurs well for Uzma, which is also eyeing risk-sharing contracts (RSC) for marginal oilfield developments.  Chiong is now \\u201cneutral\\u201d on Uzma, with a RM5.05 price target, but foresees the successful bagging of an RSC, bringing the company better fortunes. Low, on the other hand, still has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call and RM5.20 target price. Time will tell, who has the better call. CIMB Research analyst Norziana Mohd Inon and KAF-Seagroatt & Campbell Securities analyst Dharmini Thuraisingam\\u2019s calls on Alam Maritim Resources Bhd \\u201cAlam Maritim Resources Bhd is not done yet, with its splashy comeback this year\\u201d \\u2014 that\\u2019s what CIMB Research\\u2019s Norziana Mohd Inon told clients in March 2013, after the stock leapt from 50 sen in October 2012, to around 85 sen. From there, the stock nearly doubled, in less than four months, to as high as RM1.67 in July 2013. It was still up 122% at its RM1.52 close, on Dec 16, 2013. Norziana, who started coverage on Alam Maritim in March 2008, continues to be bullish on the company, due to its ballooning order book and the anticipation of improvements in utilisation and charter rates, amid a significant pick-up in offshore drilling activities. Her target price was RM1.90, at the time of writing. Another long-time believer of Alam Maritim is KAF-Seagroatt & Campbell Securities\\u2019 Dharmini Thuraisingam, who also saw the recovery on charter rates for offshore vessels. In January 2013, she told clients that the earlier spike in share price was just the beginning of a larger structural re-rating of the stock. She has a target price of RM1.80. Due to the strong gains seen at Alam Maritim in 2013, both analysts earn notable mentions for their continued conviction that proved propitious for clients, although their calls have been maintained for years. CIMB Research analyst Nigel Foo\\u2019s call on My EG Services Bhd If My EG Services Bhd\\u2019s shares ran harder in 2012, CIMB Research\\u2019s Nigel Foo might have earned the Best Discovery award in 2012. The delayed response by the market notwithstanding, investors who picked up My EG shares at 73 sen levels, when Foo started coverage with a \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Aug 6, 2012, would have more-than-tripled their investments in just 16 months. My EG\\u2019s lowest point in 2013, was 74 sen on Feb 6, during which, Foo told clients that the shares were worth RM1.34 apiece. Those who bought back the shares would have been sitting on 260% of gains, as they touched RM2.67 apiece on Nov 27. Total returns were still 249%, if measured between the initiation on Aug 6, 2012, and Dec 16\\u2019s RM2.54 close. In his initiation note, Foo said that My EG could even thrive in recessions, as consumers are encouraged to use its cheaper and more convenient services. It also enjoys some recurring income, he said in a note, on Sept 19, 2013, which highlighted potential income stream from the custom service tax monitoring system and road safety diagnostic services, that had not been pencilled into its forecasts. Foo has since cut My EG to \\u201chold\\u201d on Dec 12, 2013, with there being only 6.1% upside potential to his RM2.78 target price, from its RM2.62 close that day. That\\u2019s conservative relative to Macquarie Research, which became the second house to start coverage on My EG, on Aug 15, 2013. The latter still says \\u201cbuy\\u201d, with a RM3 target price. AmResearch analyst Thomas Soon\\u2019s call on KKB Engineering Bhd When AmResearch\\u2019s Thomas Soon initiated coverage on KKB Engineering Bhd with a \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Sept 3, 2012, the stock was hovering near a two-year low of RM1.45. The counter hardly moved, but eight months later, Soon saw reason to raise his price target, from RM1.80 to RM1.91 apiece, on April 19, 2013. Citing information from KKB\\u2019s 2012 annual report, Soon flagged KKB chairman Datuk Kho Kak Beng\\u2019s statement, that the group \\u201cstands ready to expand further into fabrication, for the oil and gas sector, in the near future\\u201d, having more-than-tripled its yard capacity, to 50,000 tonnes in 2012.  Its prospects have also \\u201cbrightened considerably\\u201d, since its 43%-owned associate Oceanmight Sdn Bhd secured a three-year Petronas Approved Supplier licence, which allows it to tender for offshore facility fabrication jobs. Among the jobs that it has since bagged, include a RM17.1 million fabrication job for Petronas\\u2019 proposed LNG Train 9 Project in Bintulu, Sarawak. Incidentally, KKB was also hovering at RM1.45 levels, on April 19, 2013. Investors who bought on Soon\\u2019s cue, would have seen 96% gains in about six months, as the stock reached as high as RM2.84 on Oct 31, 2013 \\u2014 exceeding his target price of RM2.50, at the time. He has since downgraded his recommendation to \\u201chold\\u201d, with a target price of RM2.71 \\u2014 a level the stock hit on Dec 16. The price target had worked in a 5% discount to his RM2.85 sum-of-parts valuation of the company, which is 20% owned by Cahya Mata Sarawak Bhd. Alliance Research analyst Ian Wan\\u2019s call on Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd If Alliance Research\\u2019s Ian Wan had a crystal ball, he might have chosen to tell clients to buy a little more Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd shares at RM12 levels, given that the stock did appreciate another 42%, to reach a peak of RM17.06 on May 31, 2013. What impressed the judges, that they gave him a coveted spot in 2013, however, was how he rightly told clients to buy the stock, up to about the RM12 levels, and then correctly cut his recommendation to \\u201csell\\u201d, on May 30, 2013 \\u2014 just before Carlsberg peaked and began sliding. This was after the brewery\\u2019s 1QFY2013 results came in below expectations, making up only 23.3% of Alliance Research\\u2019s full-year forecast. When the stock had shed some 29% to reach the RM12 levels again, Wan raised his call to \\u201cneutral\\u201d on Nov 19, 2013, despite the company\\u2019s 3QFY2013 results, coming in below expectations yet again. He justified that the overall downside is limited, after the share price slid 24%, since his \\u201csell\\u201d call on May 30. \\u201cWe believe, at its current valuation, market has largely priced in the challenging outlook. As such, we upgrade the stock from \\u2018sell\\u2019 to \\u2018neutral\\u2019,\\u201d he said in the report, while revising the target price to RM11.24, which implies 18.9 times earnings and a 5.3% yield for FY2014. Will his call continue to prove prescient? DBS Vickers Research analyst Quah He Wei\\u2019s call on Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd DBS Vickers Research\\u2019s Quah He Wei, once wrote in his note, that Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd had \\u201c[hit] a jackpot!\\u201d Investors who paid attention when he recommended that they buy Dayang, as far back as July 2011, when the stock was going for RM1.80 apiece, would have hit a small jackpot of their own, as the stock price rallied in 2013. If measured from a low of RM2.302 in late-February 2013, Dayang\\u2019s shares had increased 147%, as it hit a 52-week high of RM5.69, on Dec 13, 2013. On hindsight, the call would have been near perfect, had he only started coverage about a year earlier, when the stock was going for RM1.77. Seven out of eight analysts polled on Bloomberg, still have a \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Dayang, according to Bloomberg data, at the time of writing. Quah\\u2019s RM5.90 target price is the most conservative, being RM1.08 or 15.5% below the most-bullish target price of RM6.98 apiece. At Dec 16\\u2019s RM5.59 close, Quah\\u2019s price target implied only 5.5% upside potential. Regardless of whether a downgrade is in store, or if he will turn out to be overly conservative, he has earned a spot for the best recommendation, among the submissions received for consideration. That, in itself, warrants a pat on the back.

He said Affin IB Research\nhad a 2014 year end target of 1,980 for the FBM KLCI, representing a 7.4%\nupside and a 12.4% gain for investors, adding that the FBM KLCI was valued at\n16 times PE.  Speaking to the media here\nyesterday in conjunction with the soft launch of the Malaysian Association of\nTechnical Analysts (MATA), he added the factors that would support his\nhypothesis was the fact that the US economy had the best growth in five years,\nand that Europe was also beginning to show firmer improvement.  Nazri, who is also the\npresident of MATA, said the association now had 50 members and was targeting to\nhave at least 300 members by next year. On the local front, Nazri\nsaid that in 2014 there were no political issues like elections that could\ncause investor unrest; execution of the Economic Transformation Programme (ETP)\nthat was better than expected; and a catalystic Johor Corridor that would see\nbetter performance for property- and oil & gas-related stocks.  Nazri said the two main\nsectors that investors should take serious note in 2014 were the oil and gas as\nwell as the technology sector.  He said that for the oil and\ngas sector, national oil firm Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) had taken the\nlead with the RM60 billion Pengerang project, from which local oil and gas\nplayers would benefit most.  Dr Mohd Nazri Khan Nazri said during the early\npart of this year, oil and gas-related penny stocks had been performing well,\nadding this trend was set to continue. He said another factor that\naugurs well for the local stock market was the slew of mega initial public\nofferings (IPOs) that had been scheduled for 2014, which he estimated would\nhave a total capitalisation in excess of US$8.1 billion.  \\u201c2013 was a quiet year in\nterms of mega IPOs, unlike in 2012. This year will be better than 2012,\\u201d he\nsaid. Nazri said he expects another good year this year with at least 15 IPOs floated on the exchange, thus exceeding 2012 offerings.He stressed that last year, Bursa Malaysia handled only US$4 billion IPOs and US$7 billion in 2012.Nazri added that the\nEmployees Provident Fund (EPF), Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera (LTAT) and\nKumpulan Wang Persaraan (KWAP) were ready and able to subscribe shares in the\nmega IPOs, stressing that the funds had ample liquidity to mop up the shares.

In a filing with Bursa Malaysia yesterday, the offshore construction and marine service provider said the rise in net profit was due to deferred tax and lower minority interest. The dip in revenue from RM857 million in the previous quarter to RM726.31 million in 4Q13 was due to lower contribution from its marine segment, which saw a sharp decline in revenue from RM172.5 million in 4Q12 to RM90.3 million in 4Q13. For the full year, MHB recorded a net profit of RM236.47 million, a decline of 2.3% from RM242 million in FY12. Revenue fell 15.4% to RM2.9 billion from RM3.3 billion in the previous year. The company proposed a final single-tier dividend of five sen per share for FY13 (FY12: 10 sen). On a segmental basis, the offshore business saw a full year profit of RM104.9 million, down 31.7% from RM483.8 million made in the previous year, owing to higher than expected cost to complete ongoing projects. The marine business division generated a full year profit of RM70.4 million, down 12.9% from RM80.8 million in FY12. This is attributed to a lower revenue of RM372 million, against RM483.8 million in FY12. During the year, MHB successfully sailed away/completed six structures for its clients, including the OSX-3 FPSO external turret, Telok-B topside and Telok-B jacket, and the Gumusut-Kakap floating production system (FPS). The company said the semi-submersible Gumusut-Kakap FPS was the largest such facility in the world to have been fully built and integrated on land. The FPS was handed over to the client in June 2013.

The company proposed a final dividend of 40 sen per ordinary share under a single tier system for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2013. This amounts to RM791 million. In a statement to Bursa Malaysia, PetGas said the profit increase was in line with the increase in revenue. In addition, there was higher other income and share of profit from associate and joint ventures. The firm also said its larger profit was due to lower tax expense resulting from a change in deferred tax estimates. This came on the back of a lower future statutory tax rate. PetGas said its revenue increase was largely due to regasification revenue. This followed commencement of the LNG Regasification Terminal operations in the second quarter last year and higher gas transportation revenue. The firm, however, said the increase was partially offset by lower utilities revenue on the back of lower offtake by customers. For the full-year period, net profit earned was RM2.1 billion, up from RM1.4 billion in the previous corresponding period, while revenue raked in was RM3.9 billion from RM3.6 billion a year ago. PetGas said the cumulative profit was mainly due to contribution from its regasification segment from the second quarter last year. But it was partially offset by gain from partial disposal of shareholding in Gas Malaysia Bhd in the previous year. Furthermore the firm said the higher profit was due to recognition of deferred tax assets arising from investment tax allowance granted for the LNG Regasification Terminal amounting to RM626.4 million. PetGas said the improved cumulative revenue was due to similar reasons given for the fourth quarter. \\u201cLooking ahead, the group\\u2019s earnings are expected to remain stable as the structure of the new gas processing and transmission agreements are expected to be not significantly different from the existing structure,\\u201d said PetGas.The new agreements will replace the existing Gas Processing and Transmission Agreement (GPTA) effective April 1, 2014, it added.

The group\\u2019s market cap stood at RM9.06 billion on Jan 22 thanks to the gains in its share price, which closed at RM4.19 on the same day. This represents a staggering 49% increase from its initial public offering (IPO) issue price of RM2.80 per share, which implied a total capitalisation of RM6.05 billion. According to UMW-OG president Rohaizad Darus, the incoming deliveries of new jack-up (JU) drilling rigs will boost the group\\u2019s earnings substantially over the next two years. Drilling services contributed 94% to its total revenue for the first nine months of last year (9M2013). \\u201cIt\\u2019s simple mathematics. Our four operational rigs currently generate a certain amount of revenue. If we add another one, our bottom line will increase by 25%,\\u201d he says during a media briefing last Thursday. Rohaizad was referring to Naga 5, the group\\u2019s latest premium JU rig, which is scheduled for delivery in May. UMW-OG has already secured a US$7 million contract from Nido Petroleum Philippines Pty Ltd for the provision of drilling services by the new rig. Apart from its JU fleet, the group is also the sole Malaysian operator of hydraulic workover units (HWUs), with four currently being deployed in three countries on short- and long-term tenures. Coupled with a RM1 billion war chest from its IPO proceeds after deducting last year\\u2019s expenses, Rohaizad is confident that the group can leverage on its working relationship with Petroliam Nasional Bhd and other oil majors to secure new contracts for its JU rigs and HWUs. \\u201cWe believe we are able to finance a significant number of new rigs and also secure new contracts due to the increasing regional demand.\\u201d Despite its recent share price gains, there are contrasting valuations on the company by research houses. According to Bloomberg data, the consensus analyst view is mostly bearish with 9 out of 13 research houses issuing a \\u201cneutral\\u201d or \\u201csell\\u201d rating on UMW-OG. The most bullish are Maybank IB Research and CIMB Research, which set a target price of RM4.80 and RM4.63 respectively. At the other end of the spectrum is Goldman Sachs Research, which set a fair value of a mere RM2.70 on the oil and gas operator. In a Jan 20 note, Maybank IB argues that the delivery of another two JU rigs \\u2014 Naga 6 and Naga 7 \\u2014 by 2015 warrants a premium valuation on the stock. At RM4.80 per share, the research firm has pegged UMW-OG\\u2019s shares at 23 times projected earnings for FY2015. In its calculations, Maybank IB projected that UMW-OG\\u2019s core net profit and core earnings per share will triple within two years after taking into account the additional revenue boost from the three upcoming JU rigs. \\u201cThe market now demands new, premium JUs, favoured for their superior security, cost and operating features. More importantly, UMW-OG has the balance sheet strength to expand its JU fleet size beyond the projected five units,\\u201d it says. However, it is worth noting that new contracts are the lifeblood of oil and gas companies. UMW-OG\\u2019s contract backlog stands at RM1.45 billion, a small figure compared with the order books of other big caps such as SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd (RM28 billion) and Bumi Armada Bhd (RM10.8 billion), says Alliance Research, which has a \\u201csell\\u201d call on the stock, pegging the fair value at RM3.16. The research outfit says UMW-OG\\u2019s valuation has exceeded its peers, whose shares are currently trading at lower price-earnings multiples. \\u201cWhile the growth outlook for UMW-OG is promising, especially if the group adds on new rigs, we view that valuations have run too far ahead of peers at this juncture,\\u201d it says. At the moment, a huge chunk of UMW-OG\\u2019s revenue comes from contracts awarded by Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd (PCSB), with three out of four rigs deployed for the upstream player\\u2019s needs. Apart from PCSB, UMW-OG\\u2019s client base for the JU rigs consists of HESS, Japan Vietnam Petroleum Co and Nido Petroleum. Underlining its regional expansion plans, Rohaizad says the group is working towards achieving a 50-50 revenue contribution from domestic and overseas operations respectively. For 9M2013, 66% of its revenue came from Malaysia. \\u201cNaga 3 will be moved to Vietnam while Naga 5 will be operating in the Philippines, where we have never been to before. We also have a presence in China, Thailand, Indonesia and Turkmenistan in various capacities.\\u201d The bullish outlook is mainly supported by the upcoming expiration of a whopping 41 JU rig contracts in Southeast Asia this year. In Malaysia, there are currently 18 JUs, of which 16 are foreign owned. In line with the growing demand, daily charter rates for JUs have accordingly risen over the past four years. According to Maybank IB, average day rates are now holding steadily at US$150,000 and should rise to between US$160,000 and US$170,000 levels due to the favourable oil price environment as well as a mismatch between demand and supply. However, it is apparent that the group will have to aggressively expand its operations and secure new contracts on a consistent basis, either one of which is no small task. The drilling services industry also remains highly competitive, and there is no shortage of international oil and gas operators bidding for the same projects that UMW-OG is gunning for. UMW-OG will be spending its cash pile on two new rigs \\u2014 Naga 6 and Naga 7. Will Petronas, which is the company\\u2019s major client, also deploy the new jack-up rigs? That will determine whether the bullishness on the stock is justifiable.

According to Maybank IB, average day rates are now holding steadily at US$150,000 and should rise to between US$160,000 and US$170,000 levels due to the favourable oil price environment as well as a mismatch between demand and supply. However, it is apparent that the group will have to aggressively expand its operations and secure new contracts on a consistent basis, either one of which is no small task. The drilling services industry also remains highly competitive, and there is no shortage of international oil and gas operators bidding for the same projects that UMW-OG is gunning for. UMW-OG will be spending its cash pile on two new rigs \\u2014 Naga 6 and Naga 7. Will Petronas, which is the company\\u2019s major client, also deploy the new jack-up rigs? That will determine whether the bullishness on the stock is justifiable.

Elsewhere, U.S. stocks could be set for another selloff next\nweek as the Federal Reserve is expected to announce it will keep withdrawing\nits economic stimulus, further pressuring equities already roiled by a flight\nfrom emerging markets, according to Reuters.  Affin IB vice president and head of retail research Dr Nazri\nKhan said that going\nforward, he expects the local stock market to dip further dampened by emerging\nmarket currency roil (led by record low Argentina Peso, Turkey Lira) &\nweaker ringgit (USD/MYR 3.3371 the weakest level since August 28, 2013), thin\nholiday session, and negative reading of USA & Chinese manufacturing data\nsuggesting a temporary cooldown in the world's largest & second-largest\neconomy.  Nazri said that Asian equities trend downward as emerging\nmarkets currency rout sparked fresh jitters about funds outflow and developing\ncountries economic momentum.  He said the FBM KLCI had tested 1,800 psychochological level\nthree times last week and seemed not to have enough bullish inertia to follow\nthrough. Nazri said barring any FBM KLCI close below 1,750, any\nweakness was viewed as an opportunity to re-enter cheaper as both fundamentals\nand technical uptrendline remains sound and intact.  He said that on the technical front, the daily stochastics\nhad crossed over down which was a bearish indication.  He said momentum studies trending lower at mid-range should\naccelerate a move lower if support levels are taken out, adding that a negative\nsignal for trend short-term was given on the convergence of 20 and 50 day\nmoving average. Nazri said the FBM KLCI should extend its the near-term\ndowntrend (sixteenth straight down days since Dec 31, 2013 when it high record\nhigh of 1882.20).  He said that year-to-date, the FBMKLCI already lost 3.4% or\n65 points with average weekly losers thrash gainers 5 to 3 on rising trade\ntotalling 1.5bn shares worth RM2 billion.  \\u201cThe index appears to have potential to overtake support for\na deeper corrective setback toward the near term support of 1,780 level. \\u201cMeanwhile, we are pegging near term resistance comes in at\n1,820 and 1,830 levels.

The deployment of additional vessels last year, coupled with improved charter rates, also allowed SILK\\u2019s oil and gas segment to record a pre-tax profit of RM41.7 million compared with RM37.5 million previously.

Recall that Perisai had placed an order with SembCorp Marine (SMM) to acquire a high-spec jack-up rig (high temperature, high pressure) for US$208 million (RM678 million), to be delivered by July 2014. While Perisai is close to securing its first jack-up rig contract, channel checks suggest that the charter rates could be much lower than our original forecast charter rate of US$190,000 per day as the contract may be longer in tenure. We estimate that the rig contract will lift 2014 earnings by RM19 million (assuming a charter rate of US$150,000 per day). On Dec 31, 2013, Perisai had announced that it had ordered its third jack-up drilling rig from PPL Shipyard, Singapore for US$211.5 million. Perisai will pay a 10% deposit to PPL Shipyard in the first quarter (1Q) of 2014 and will need to pay another 10% by end-2014 while the remaining 80% will be paid upon delivery. Compared with its first two jack-up rigs, Perisai is paying an additional US$3.5 million for its third jack-up rig. We understand that jack-up rig builders are well booked for the next two years, so there is a chance for more price hikes as global demand for the asset remains strong. Hence, the purchase is timely to leverage on Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u2019s (Petronas) asset localisation policy. We are encouraged by the charter commencement of Perisai\\u2019s floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel after a delay since late-July. It marks the company\\u2019s entry into the FPSO segment and its transformation from a bareboat charterer to an operator. Early contributions from the vessel will be reflected in its results for the fourth quarter of financial year 2013 ended Dec 31 (4QFY13), reducing the earnings vacuum caused by two idle assets, namely its mobile offshore production unit (MOPU) and derrick pipelay barge. Channel checks suggest that Perisai is currently vying for at least two potential contracts for its MOPU. We understand that on the domestic front, Perisai is tying up with Talisman Energy Inc to charter out its MOPU if Talisman secures a production sharing contract (PSC) in the PM9 oilfield, off peninsular Malaysia. Industry publication Upstream online recently reported that Perisai is tying up with PetroVietnam Drilling to supply its MOPU to Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd\\u2019s marginal oilfields in Vietnam called Ham Rong and Gau Chua-Ca Cao. While we are hopeful on both prospects, we gather that progress has been slow as the MOPU was previously designed for a gas field, hence it is a bit more challenging to charter it out. We do not discount the possibility of an equity fund raising exercise in 2014 given the strength of Perisai\\u2019s share price. Recall that the company will need to fork out some RM500 million this year to pay for its first jack-up rig, to be delivered towards the end of the second quarter of 2014 (2Q14), and an additional RM500 million for its second jack-up rig in 2015. For now, we assume that the company will raise the funds via debt in our earnings forecast. We anticipate weaker sequential earnings in 4QFY13 due to the lack of charter income for its MOPU and derrick pipelay barge, although the weakness will be partially offset by maiden contributions from its new FPSO vessel (Perisai Kamelia) and its offshore support vessels. For our earnings forecast for 2014, we are taking a conservative approach with our forecasts and impute merely six months\\u2019 contribution (previously nine months) from its MOPU and derrick pipelay barge, leaving some room for upgrades later if it secures a charter before end-2Q14. We are also including six months\\u2019 earnings contribution from its jack-up rig (assuming a charter rate of US$150,000 per day). For 2015, we assume full-year earnings contributions from its offshore support vessels, FPSO, MOPU, derrick pipelay barge and first jack-up rig. We estimate that Perisai\\u2019s second jack-up rig could enhance our earnings forecast by RM19 million (assuming a charter rate of US$150,000 per day) if it is able to secure the contract by the end of this year. This will prompt further rerating for the stock in our view. We reiterate our \\u201cbuy\\u201d recommendation on Perisai with a higher target price of RM2.18 as we roll over our valuations to 2015 coupled with an earnings revision. Our target price is premised on 14 times 2015F price-earnings ratio and includes the option of securing a second rig contract. We advocate investors to accumulate the shares if it weakens as the current share price has probably factored in the charter of its first jack-up rig. We still believe that there is upside if Perisai is able to realise its full earnings potential. An ideal accumulation level will be in the range of RM1.40 to RM1.50. \\u2014 UOB KayHian Research, Jan 13 This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on January 15, 2014."}, "1077": {"date_posted": "14/1/2014", "title": "Petronas jobs could further buoy Puncak-WB", "article": " PUNCAK Niaga Holdings Bhd shares sped to a new 52-week intra-day high of RM3.51, last Nov 13, on news that its wholly-owned subsidiary GOM Offshore is a front runner for jobs worth nearly RM1 billion, to be dished out under Petronas\\u2019 Pan Malaysia transportation and installation (T&I) tenders soon.  The excitement rubbed off on its warrants, Puncak-WB, whose gains over the same three-day period, during the week of Nov 11-17, 2013, beat the underlying securities. Apart from the potential boost to GOM Offshore\\u2019s order book, Affin Investment Research\\u2019s Chong Lee Len, for one, told clients that she is \\u201cconfident there is still upside potential to its current share price\\u201d. That\\u2019s given the imperfect information and ambiguity surrounding the offer by the Selangor government, to purchase its water assets by year-end 2013. \\u201cWe believe the investing community may have underestimated the group\\u2019s probable realisable water asset value,\\u201d writes Chong in a Nov 11, 2013 note. \\u201cThe missing link is the RM1.8 billion trade receivables sitting on the group\\u2019s books, owed by Syabas to the group\\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary Puncak Niaga Sdn Bhd (PNSB), which operates the water treatment plants,\\u201d she adds, reiterating a \\u201ctrading buy\\u201d and RM4.60 target price for Puncak. This values its water assets at RM3.93 apiece, and its oil and gas business at 65 sen apiece. Chong\\u2019s price target is the most bullish among six analysts covering the stock, Bloomberg data shows. The price target also implies an upside potential of 34.1%, from Nov 14, 2013's close of RM3.43. The upside potential is even more pronounced for Puncak-WB, which has nearly five years to run before expiring in July 2018, and is exchangeable for an ordinary share, with a strike price of RM1 apiece. At Nov 14's close of RM2.45, the warrant was traded at a premium of only 0.58% to the underlying stock, which ended at RM3.43 apiece \\u2014 a decent price, considering its tenure to maturity. Assuming zero premiums to the mother share, Puncak-WB should theoretically be trading at RM3.60 [RM4.60-RM1] \\u2014 about 47% higher than the RM2.45 closing price on Nov 14, if the mother shares reach Affin\\u2019s RM4.60 target price. AmResearch, which reiterated a \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Oct 23, 2013, has a more conservative price target of RM4.03 apiece, translating into a 40% discount to its net asset value. Its price target still implies a 17.5% upside potential for the mother shares, and in turn, a 23.7% upside potential for Puncak-WB, which would, in theory, be worth RM3.03 apiece [RM4.03-RM1]. RHB Research, however, values Puncak at only RM2.51 apiece, and reiterated a \\u201csell\\u201d on Oct 2, 2013, Bloomberg data shows.

The other contender for these packages is Singapore\\u2019s Swiber Offshore. However, SAKP is said to have the edge over Swiber, given Petronas\\u2019 local preference policy. These contracts have already been factored into our estimates, as SAKP has been the key contractor for Malaysian installation work since 2008. Based on the rates indicated by Petronas, we estimate Packages C, D and E can be worth RM3 billion to RM3.5 billion, assuming a three-year term. This is less than SAKP\\u2019s previous contract sum of RM4.5 billion, for four packages awarded in 2008.  Despite the smaller contract value, we expect margins to be better this time around, as the group\\u2019s vessels working on the job will be wholly-owned. We maintain our \\u201cstrong buy\\u201d call on SAKP, with a view to raise earnings estimates. Scientex BhdTarget price: RM6.28 OUTPERFORM KENANGA RESEARCH (Nov 12): On Nov 11, 2013, Scientex announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire the entire stake in Seacera Polyfilms Sdn Bhd \\u2014 a manufacturer of biaxially-oriented polypropylene (BOPP) films, which are used for packaging.  We are positive about the proposed acquisition, as it will enable Scientex to venture into an essential component of the consumer packaging product industry, and to gain a larger share of the market.  Based on the announcement, Seacera Polyfilms recorded a revenue of RM44.5 million and a net profit of RM500,000, for the year ended Dec 31, 2012.  However, we understand that the low net profit was due to management fees owed to Seacera Group, which will be reversed under the share sale agreement. On this basis, Seacera Polyfilm\\u2019s net profit is actually RM2.8 million, implying a PER of 14.3 times. We remain positive about Scientex\\u2019s ongoing expansion plans and earnings potential.

We believe, the news that YTL Power submitted the lowest bid for project 3B, will put the company on investors\\u2019 radar again.  The rerating catalyst will be the announcement of YTL Power, securing the contract for project 3B, which is expected to be known by early 2014. Assuming YTL Power wins the bid, this will provide the group with consistent cash flows from 2018 onwards, and will supplement its current stable businesses. Although the dividends can be called into question, given the high capex required for the project, we believe YTL Power can ring-fence the construction cost, because of the strong and stable cash flow of the plant. Stronger cash flows from the project, will likely translate into bigger dividends in the long term. Furthermore, the return of YTL Power to the independent power producer scene, implies that there may be more major contracts ahead.Guinness Anchor BhdTarget price: RM17.50 NEUTRAL CIMB RESEARCH (Nov 10): Guinness Anchor Bhd (GAB) saw its 1QFY14 net profit fall 13% y-o-y, to RM49.6 million. The poor result was due to the drag from the planned reduction in distributor stocks, and weaker consumer spending in anticipation of subsidy cuts and the Goods and Services Tax under Budget 2014.  We believe it was also due to less aggressive advertising and promotion (A&P) activities in 1QFY14, as well as pre-budget stockpiling by retailers. We cut our FY14-16 net profit forecasts by 4% to 8%, after lowering our sales expectations by 7%. Our dividend discount model-based target price, is reduced correspondingly. Although GAB\\u2019s valuation is unattractive, its 4% to 4.5% dividend yield will lend support to its share price.  We think competition will remain intense going forward, as Carlsberg has also been investing heavily in A&P, in the past few months. To remain competitive, GAB will continue to invest in brand line extension. It will launch several new brands in FY14, especially in the super premium and premium beer categories. Petronas Chemicals BhdTarget price: RM6.15 HOLD HWANGDBS VICKERS RESEARCH (Nov 11): Following Petronas Chemicals\\u2019 3QFY13 results conference call, we understand that the group\\u2019s olefins and derivatives segment recorded lower plant utilisation of 77.6%, mainly due to heavier-than-usual maintenance at its main cracker and downstream-related facilities. Similarly, the fertiliser and methanol segment\\u2019s plant utilisation rate dropped to 62.3%, from 80.3% in 2Q13, as a result of unplanned shutdown at its methanol plant, stemming from technical issues related to gas quality and equipment concerns. These issues have since been addressed. The methanol plant will likely remain idle until the end of year 2013, coinciding with the upstream shutdown. To date, Project Samur has incurred 45% of its capital expenditure, and is on track for commissioning in 2015. The final investment decision for the BASF Aroma Complex, is expected by year-end. We expect the company to improve its performance come 2014. Datasonic Group BhdTarget price: RM10.51 BUY RHB RESEARCH (Nov 12): Datasonic received an extension of contract worth RM182.8 million, to supply 10 million raw MyKads to be delivered in December 2013, on top of the RM73.1 million contract to supply four million new MyKads awarded by the National Registration Department in 2011.  Sources indicate that the government is looking to place orders for 10 million more new cards worth RM180 million to RM190 million, in 1QFY14, to curb identity fraud-related crimes. In 2012, Datasonic won a RM284.7 million contract to supply photo pages for 10 million passports, over five years. It started supplying the sheets in 3QFY13, and management indicated an annual run rate of 2.4 million to 2.5 million copies.  We forecast that Datasonic will more than double its net profit to RM76.7 million, by FY13. We foresee the group\\u2019s bottom line breaching the RM100 million threshold in FY15, after taking into account the potential replenishment of 10 million new MyKads, and likely margins enhancement, after the completion of its new MyKad assembly plant by end-FY13.AMMB Holdings BhdTarget price: RM7.89 NEUTRAL ALLIANCE RESEARCH (Nov 12): Local dailies reported that AmFraser Securities Pte Ltd, a wholly-owned brokerage unit of AMMB, is believed to have financial exposure of close to S$150 million (RM384.6 million), related to the recent share price collapse of Blumont Group Ltd, LionGold Corp Ltd and Asiasons Capital Ltd, listed on the Singapore Exchange.  We have not adjusted our earnings estimates, in view of the uncertainties and complexity of the issue. Besides that, it remains to be seen how much of such financial exposure is being collateralised. On a positive note, our recent correspondence with the management of AMMB, indicated that the incident does not have a significant impact on the group\\u2019s FY14 earnings.  We are maintaining our \\u201cneutral\\u201d call for the group, with an unchanged target price of RM7.89. Our target price implied a 1.7 times 2014 price-to-book ratio and 15% return on equity, based on our Gordon Growth valuation model. Westports Holdings Bhd Target price: RM2.70 BUY  MAYBANK INVESTMENT (Nov 12): We expect 4QFY13 earnings to be boosted by the seasonally stronger volume from the Christmas-related trade and a substantially lower effective tax rate, as the group starts to enjoy tax holiday for the new wharf under container terminal 7. We note that 4QFY12 net profit accounted for 38% of Westports\\u2019 full-year FY12 earnings. We recently met up with CMA CGM \\u2014 Westports\\u2019 biggest client, to assess the implications of the proposed P3 alliance on Westports. The key takeaways are: (i) net volume loss at Westports could be only 175,000 TEUs per annum or 2% of Westports\\u2019 total volume, as CMA CGM introduces new non-P3 services from 1HFY14 onwards; and (ii) CMA CGM will remain committed to hubbing at Westports. Taking into consideration the P3-related volume loss and growth from the non-P3 business, we project a container throughput growth of 7% (FY13), 6% (FY14) and 8% (FY15). Given its dividend payout policy of 75%, we project a net dividend yield of 4.1% for FY14.Mah Sing Group Bhd Fair value: RM3.80 BUY  AMRESEARCH (Nov 11): We consider the nine months\\u2019 results to be in line, constituting 75% of our full-year estimates and 73% of consensus.  Mah Sing\\u2019s unbilled sales stood at a sturdy RM4.2 billion (2.7 times FY12 property revenue). The group is on track to achieve its FY13F new sales target of RM3 billion, having secured close to RM2.3 billion for 9MFY13. Key projects are [email\\u00a0protected], M Residence 1 & 2, M City, as well as Mah Sing i-Parc.  We expect Mah Sing to potentially lock in around RM718 million for the pre-selected units in D\\u2019Sara Sentral and Savanna\\u2019s initial launches. The strong take-up rates achieved for both projects, come without Developer Interest Bearing Scheme incentives. Mah Sing\\u2019s future launches will focus on larger township projects offering affordable products, notably landed residential units or apartments with initial price points of below RM500,000.  Nestle (M) BhdTarget price: RM72.80 MARKET OUTPERFORM KENANGA RESEARCH (Nov 12): Nescafe has a strong market share of more than 70% in the local market, where consumption of coffee is still considered at the lower-end of 120 cups per capita.  A survey also showed that coffee contributed only 9% to the overall beverage market, hinting at more room for growth. YTD, Nescafe\\u2019s volume growth outperformed that of the overall coffee market.  We continue to see vast growth opportunities, driven by Nestle\\u2019s product innovation, marketing investments and capacity expansion. Including the construction of a new plant, Nestle management has guided a capex of RM250 million for FY13E. We estimate net gearing for FY13E will be reduced slightly, from 0.38 times to 0.32 times. Construction of the new plant is on schedule and will commence operations in the middle of 2014. Due to the minor changes in the fixed assets, as a result of the capex adjustment, our net profit forecast is edged slightly higher by 0.1% to 0.2%, for FY13E and FY14E, from RM544.3 million-RM588.6 million to RM545.1 million-RM589.5 million.Boustead HeavyIndustries Corp BhdFair value: RM3.80 BUY AMRESEARCH (Nov 12): BHIC\\u2019s 51%-owned Contraves Advanced Devices Sdn Bhd (CAD) has been awarded a contract by its 21%-owned Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd (BNS), to supply the torpedo launching system for the second-generation littoral combat ship (LCS) programme. Currently, CAD has already secured RM2.5 billion in subcontract works from BNS. This represents 30% of the confirmed RM9 billion LCS contract value, that was awarded to BNS. Including the torpedo launching system, we believe that the total value of CAD\\u2019s subcontracts could reach RM3 billion.  We expect the earnings contribution from these LCS subcontract works to be progressively recognised throughout the 10-year delivery period. Hence, we maintain BHIC\\u2019s FY13F to FY15F earnings, on expectations of a significant y-o-y surge in 4QFY13 earnings, as BNS has yet to recognise progress billings from the LCS contract to date.  The stock currently trades at an attractive FY14F PER of only six times, 70% below Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd\\u2019s current valuation.
