Ekuiti Nasional Bhd (Ekuinas) \\u2014 which owns 42% of Malaysia's largest pure play offshore support vessel (OSV) provider Icon Offshore Bhd, and one of the largest in Asia now in terms of the number of vessels it owns \\u2014 is confident of unlocking the company\\u2019s value. Ekuinas chairman Raja Tan Sri Arshad Raja Tan Uda said the government-linked private equity fund will stay invested in Icon Offshore and continue to add value to the company. Icon Offshore, which was only listed on the local exchange on June 25 last year, has been in the news of late due to the remand to its chief executive officer Dr Jamal Yusof and chief operating officer Rahman Yusof by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), to facilitate and assist in investigations conducted by the MACC. Both directors are now on a six-month leave of absence to focus on assisting the MACC in its ongoing investigations, according to the group. Nylex (Malaysia) Bhd\\u2019s (fundamental: 0.75; valuation: 2) wholly-owned subsidiary ALB Marine Sdn Bhd (AMSB) is acquiring a 6,800 tonne chemical tanker from Japan's Grulla Oceano Inc for 1.923 billion yen (RM58.3 million). The acquisition is part of its plan to venture into the business of shipowning, ship management and charter hire of tanker. Nylex said AMSB had signed a shipbuilding contract with Grulla for the proposed acquisition, which is expected to be completed by January 2017. The group will finance 70% of the purchase consideration through bank borrowings and the remaining 30% by internal funds. As at May 31, 2014, Nylex\\u2019s net debt amounted to RM77.3 million, with a gearing ratio of 26.8%. Assuming bank borrowings related to the acquisition are drawn down in full, Nylex said its gearing will go up to 40.9% with the tanker buy. Data and broadband services provider REDtone International Bhd (fundamental: 2.3; valuation: 0.5)\\u2019s net profit fell 36.8% in its third financial quarter ended Feb 28, 2015, to RM3.15 million or 0.61 sen a share, from (3QFY15) RM4.99 million or 0.99 sen a share a year ago. In what it described as a \\u201chistorically low quarter\\u201d, its revenue also fell 3.4% to RM39.52 million, from RM40.92 million in 3QFY14. REDtone said it experienced a slight growth this year, which was not sufficient to support the drop in data project revenues. Coupled with higher costs, the company said compounding factors resulted in a higher percentage drop in revenue for the same period. For the cumulative nine-month period (9MFY15), REDtone\\u2019s net profit contracted 12.3% to RM12.88 million or 2.47 sen a share, from RM14.68 million or 2.9 sen a share a year ago. This came on the back of a 10.2% improvement in REDtone\\u2019s revenue for 9MFY15 to RM118.49 million, from RM107.48 million a year ago. Ancom Bhd (fundamental: 0.55; valuation: 1.2) swung to a net loss of RM2.27 million in the third financial quarter ended Feb 28, 2015 (3QFY15), compared to a net profit of RM3.76 million a year ago, mainly due to lower contribution from its investment holding, agricultural and industrial chemicals, information technology, as well as logistics divisions. This translates into a loss per share of 1.05 sen in 3QFY15, from an earnings per share of 1.74 sen per share in 3QFY14. Its revenue for 3QFY15 dipped 14.56% to RM339.64 million, from RM397.53 million a year ago. For the nine months period (9MFY15), the group posted a net loss of RM2.24 million, as compared to a net profit of RM9.95 million a year ago; while revenue fell 19.72% to RM1.14 billion, from RM1.42 billion in 9MFY14. Going forward, Ancom said its agricultural and industrial chemicals, as well as polymer divisions, are expecting challenging business environment with continued pressure on profit margin, as product suppliers and logistic providers seek higher prices. Taliworks Corp Bhd (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 2.4) is looking at one or two mergers and acquisitions (M&A) involving operational brownfield infrastructure assets in Australia and other foreign markets, to increase its revenue. Executive director Lim Yew Boon told reporters today that the M&A move \\u2014 which is being pursued by Taliworks EPF Instructure Sdn Bhd (TEI), its 51:49 joint venture firm with the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) \\u2014 is however only at its exploratory stage at the moment. He said TEI is looking at acquiring long-term highway concessionaires that have strong recurring assets. As for the group, Taliworks has a few infrastructure projects, including water supply ones, earmarked in the current financial year. Taliworks' order book stands currently at RM500 million. Lim said the group was confident of seeing a slight improvement in its revenue in its next financial quarter (2QFY15), following the contribution from the water tariff reviews in Selangor and Langkawi, Kedah, early last year. Petronas Gas Bhd (PetGas) will allocate RM5 billion as capital expenditure (capex) over the next five years. Managing director cum chief executive officer Yusa Hassan said 60% of the capex would finance PetGas' (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 1.1) liquified natural gas (LNG) regasification terminal and air separation projects in Pengerang, Johor. The balance 40% portion is for maintenance and operation capex, according to him. Yusa also said the company's \"immediate growth\" would come from the LNG regasification and air separation projects. On the regasification terminal, he expects the first tank to start operations by the end of 2017, while the second tank is anticipated to commence operations in the middle of 2018. Yusa said the air separation unit was expected to begin operations by end of 2018. MISC Bhd\\u2019s (fundamental: 2; valuation: 1) first quarter net profit came in flat at RM486.31 million, as compared to the RM486.4 million it saw a year earlier, on lower income from liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipping operations and higher cost at its heavy engineering unit. MISC said higher minority interest also led to lower profit in the first quarter ended March 31, 2015, from RM486.4 million. Revenue however rose 8.7% to RM2.49 billion, from RM2.29 billion. It said group operating profit of RM468.2 million was 7.2% lower than the corresponding quarter's profit of RM504.3 million, mainly due to lower revenue in LNG business and additional costs incurred on some heavy engineering projects. However, higher profit in offshore business and lower losses in chemical business helped to mitigate the decrease in group operating profit, said MISC, which is a 62.67%-owned subsidiary of Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas). MISC's heavy engineering unit comes under 66.5%-owned unit, Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd. Particleboard maker HeveaBoard Bhd (fundamental: 1.3, valuation: 1.4) has proposed a 1-to-4 share split of every one of its existing ordinary share of RM1, held on an entitlement date to be determined later, into four shares of 25 sen each. HeveaBoard said the proposed share split, to be implemented within the next one month, is expected to \\u201cenhance the marketability and trading liquidity\\u201d of the shares of the company. It further noted that the proposed corporate exercise will result in an adjustment to the market price of the ordinary shares of HeveaBoard, making the shares more affordable to appeal to a wider group of public shareholders and/or investors to participate in the company\\u2019s growth. The company\\u2019s issued and paid-up share capital currently stands at RM99.45 million, comprising 99.45 million shares. The company has 42.66 million outstanding warrants prior now. Assuming the full exercise of the warrants prior to the entitlement date, the enlarged issued and paid-up share capital of the company shall be RM142.11 million, comprising 568.43 subdivided shares, upon completion of the proposed share split. Parkson Holdings Bhd said its indirect subsidiary Parkson Corp Sdn Bhd (PCSB) has entered into an agreement with Studio Kingdoms Network Sdn Bhd (SKN) to establish a 70:30 joint venture in the business of operating a theme park, education centres, nursery centres, food and beverage operations and merchandising operations in Malaysia. PCSB is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parkson Retail Asia Ltd, which is in turn a 67.61%-owned unit of Parkson Holdings. In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, Parkson said Studio Kingdoms will manage the JV company, which will be named Parkson Edutainment World Sdn Bhd. \\u201cThe initial project of the JV shall be situated in Maju Junction Mall, Kuala Lumpur, and shall involve a total investment of approximately RM11 million,\\u201d the filing read. \\u201cIn addition to the initial paid-up capital of RM1 million, both PCSB and SKN will provide the JV company [with] an interest-free shareholders\\u2019 loan of up to RM7.8 million and up to RM2.2 million respectively,\\u201d it added. PCSB\\u2019s initial paid up capital will be sourced from internally-generated funds, the filing stated. Parkson (fundamental: 1.8; valuation: 1.7) said any further funding requirements will be fulfilled by shareholders\\u2019 loans or external bank borrowings. Under the JV, the theme park will operate within shopping malls in Malaysia, and feature 35 \\u201cHappy Toon World\\u201d characters from the US.

We like the group\\u2019s broad-based growth in its various business segments, rising international stature and its growing focus on the oil and gas sector, making the stock a good proxy to Malaysia\\u2019s strong spending on the sector. We expect Muhibbah to post net profit of RM99.7 million in 2014 and RM110.8 million in 2015, with earnings per share of 23.6 sen and 26.2 sen, respectively. At RM2.80, the stock\\u2019s price-earnings valuations of 11.9 times for 2014 and 10.7 times for 2015 are not expensive relative to its growth prospects and oil and gas peers, with earnings upside prospects as the group bids for more jobs. RM1.86 billion order book underpins earningsNear-term earnings will be underpinned by the large RM1.86 billion order book, of which 60% is tied to the oil and gas sector. We expect a stronger second half and 2015 as the group positions itself to tender for more oil and gas-related jobs, particularly as the the refinery and petrochemical integrated development (Rapid) petrochemical complex in Pengerang, Johor, gets underway. In April 2014, Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) had approved the final investment decision (FID) of US$27 billion (RM86.4 billion) for the Rapid project, which Muhibbah is expected to benefit from. The national oil company is expected to spend RM300 billion in capital expenditure (capex) over the next five years to set up over 50 offshore exploration wells, which will trigger strong demand for offshore pedestal cranes, support vessels and platform fabrication works. In June 2013, Petronas had granted Muhibbah a licence as an Approved Supplier for the category of \\u201cOffshore Facilities Construction \\u2014 Major Onshore Fabrication\\u201d. With its complete package of capabilities in building ships, cranes, fabricated structures, pipelines, terminals, tanks and other oil and gas-related works, the group is positioning itself to garner a larger slice of the national oil company\\u2019s capex. Among Muhibbah\\u2019s major outstanding contracts are the Wiggins Island Coal Terminal Export Project in Australia (outstanding order book RM213 million), noise barriers and enclosures for MRT Corp (RM147 million), catering facility at Doha International airport (RM103 million), government buildings in Putrajaya (RM31 million) and refurbishment of the terminal buildings at Phnom Penh and Siem Reap airports (RM83 million). Looking to secure new contractsThe group hopes its two projects in the Middle East \\u2014 the earlier completed Yemen LNG project and the Doha International Airport catering facility \\u2014 will also open the doors to more projects in the region. Qatar in particular, is investing heavily in infrastructure ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Meanwhile, Muhibbah\\u2019s Cambodian airport operations offer an attractive exposure to Cambodia\\u2019s economy, with gross domestic product growth of over 7% per year until 2015, supported by the strong tourism and textile industries. In 1QFY14, the Phnom Penh and Siem Reap airports saw a 10 year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in passenger arrivals to 1.69 million, following an already strong 18% growth in arrivals to 5.06 million for the whole of 2013. Growth will come from expansion of the two airports, as well as increased flights at the new third airport concession in Sihanoukville, the gateway to southern Cambodia\\u2019s beaches and islands, manufacturing base and newly discovered oil and gas deposits. 1QFY14 results within expectationsMuhibbah\\u2019s results for 1QFY14 were within our expectations, although they are 19% below our full year net profit on an annualised basis. We expect a stronger second half and 2015 as the group tenders for more projects, and Petronas\\u2019 Rapid project comes to fruition. Pre-tax profit for 1QFY14 came in at RM30.9 million, up 3.4% y-o-y while net profit was relatively flat, rising 1.8% to RM20.2 million. This was achieved on the back of revenue totalling RM393.9 million, up 2% y-o-y. The flattish growth in turnover and profitability in 1QFY14 reflects the completion of several large construction projects in the second half of last year, notably the South Klang Valley Expressway, which was completed in October 2013. Share of associates increased 18.2% from RM13 million to RM15.4 million, reflecting continued growth in its concession business, especially the Cambodian airports which saw a 10% rise in passenger arrivals in 1QFY14. As at May 22, 2014, Muhibbah\\u2019s outstanding order book stood at RM1.86 billion, up slightly from RM1.83 billion on Feb 21, 2014. This shows healthy order book replenishment as revenue recognised in 1QFY14 amounted to almost RM400 million. The order book comprised RM704 million from infrastructure construction, RM1.11 billion from cranes and RM45 million from shipyard.

While the competitive environment has led to a slide in MMHE\\u2019s net profit since its listing in 2011, managing director and chief executive Dominique de Soras believes that in the long run, it will help transform the group into a competitive engineering and fabrication outfit in the region. \\u201cYou need to introduce a little bit of fair competition, not only to give a chance to everybody but also to ensure that the people will perform and improve their performances. When MMHE was closely held by Petronas, the group was not challenged enough to push it to become more efficient. \\u201cThis competition has been the driver to push us forward. We may have a bit of a hard time now but I hope in the long run, it will help MMHE become better, more competitive, and able to tackle different jobs and cater for international customers,\\u201d de Soras says in an exclusive interview with The Edge. Petronas has an indirect 66.5% stake in MMHE through MISC Bhd. MMHE\\u2019s net profit for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014, fell 31.6% year on year to RM34.6 million. Its annual earnings have also been declining since its listing. Last year, it registered a net profit of RM236.5 million compared with RM242 million in FY2012 and RM334.2 million in FY2011. Research houses have mixed views on MMHE\\u2019s performance, with five \\u201cbuy\\u201d, six \\u201chold\\u201d and eight \\u201csell\\u201d calls on its stock, according to Bloomberg data. The target prices range from as low as RM3.10 to as high as RM5 per share. The company\\u2019s share price has appreciated 13.65% over the last one year to RM3.90 as at last Friday. Industry observers say MMHE has not been able to live up to its position as the engineering and fabrication yard of the Petronas group. Its order backlog stood at RM2.56 billion as at end-2013, lower than RM3.57 billion at end-2010.According to de Soras, MMHE needs a little bit of time to evolve and adapt to the challenges it faces from a more competitive industry landscape. The group is in the midst of optimising its yard to improve its processes and efficiency. \\u201cIf you look at the cost aspect, some of the structures that we are pricing today are 30% lower compared with two to three years ago. The full cost structure has to be evenly reduced. This is not something you can do in a short time,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt is not just about buying cheaper goods but also procuring more efficiently, and involves all of our subcontractors. Two years ago, a typical project took a minimum of three years, but now SK316 [in Sarawak] has to be ready in under 24 months. \\u201cIt is the result of a lot of work and improvement in our processes and engineering, and our relationship with Technip. This has allowed us to be more efficient along the steps.\\u201d MMHE owns the largest oil and gas engineering and marine fabrication yard in Malaysia, and can accommodate a single structure with a weight of 50,000 tonnes. It has also undertaken some of the most complex engineering jobs of offshore structures ever deployed on Malaysian waters. Some observers say MMHE seems to be biting more than it can chew. The delivery delays of the Gumusut-Kakap semi-submersible floating production system (FPS) is the perfect example of the limitations of the company\\u2019s expertise. MMHE is working on two large offshore structures in its yard in Pasir Gudang, Johor \\u2014 the Malikai tension leg platform and the SK316 Central Processing Platform (CPP) project. Currently, MMHE\\u2019s yard utilisation rate is about 50%. Its jobs were significantly reduced after the completion and delivery of the floating production, storage and offloading unit for Cendor, and the Tapis R topside.  MMHE targets RM5b in revenue While acknowledging that the more competitive environment in the oil and gas engineering and fabrication sector over the last two to three years has led to net margin compression for MMHE, de Soras says the group still enjoys better profitability than its foreign competitors.  \\u201cToday, our net margin is about 7% whereas in 2011, we had a slightly higher net margin of about 10%. This is due to the higher competition in the market as Petronas has opened up some of the big contracts to other local and international competitors. \\u201cHowever, if you look at some of our competitors, such as Hyundai, Daewoo and Samsung of Korea, their margins are even lower \\u2014 about 5%. This business is complex and challenging, and margins are not high,\\u201d he says. Amid the challenging outlook, de Soras is optimistic that MMHE will achieve its targeted RM5 billion annual revenue. However, it has not set a time frame to achieve this revenue target, he says. \\u201cFor me, MMHE should get RM5 billion without an issue and with a steady profit and margin. But the margins will still be about the same. I don\\u2019t think in this business we will see higher margins than around 7%. \\u201cIf I was bullish, I would say by next year we would be able to get RM5 billion in revenue. However, I have to consider that we still have our work in progress in terms of performance and delivery. I\\u2019m not here to just win orders, but to deliver good results.\\u201d MMHE is bidding for several big projects in Malaysia, both in the upstream and downstream oil and gas sector, including the US$1.5 billion CPP of the integrated Bardegg and Baronia enhanced oil recovery project off Sarawak. De Soras hopes that in the next five years, MMHE will be one of the top fabrication yards in Southeast Asia. However, it depends on whether the organisation has the willingness to keep on developing and pushing itself forward, he says. \\u201cMost likely I won\\u2019t be here [in the company], unfortunately. But I hope MMHE, in [the next] five years, will be one of the top yards in Southeast Asia. Again it depends on many factors. In terms of location, the yard has the best location and is one of the best in terms of infrastructure. \\u201cWe can build large and heavy structures, and we have deep drafts. So we are one of the best in this region. So it is just a question of the willingness of the organisation to keep developing and pushing and we could be in the top five in the region.\\u201d Frenchman de Soras has been managing director and chief executive of MMHE since 2011.

Should the sale come true, the shipping giant could fetch prices in excess of US$231 million (RM741.5 million). An industry source familiar with the matter told The Edge Financial Daily that MISC, which has an inventory of seven ships in its A-class fleet of 38,000-dwt IMO type-II/III chemical/products tankers, is already in advanced talks to sell the tankers. \\u201cThis is part of the group\\u2019s rationalisation plan, but not all seven will be sold,\\u201d the source said, adding that MISC has been downsizing its chemical tanker fleet and is expected to wrap up the deal soon. MISC sold seven chemical tankers in April.  It is understood that MISC is looking to hive off its fleet to reduce its exposure to the chemical tanker segment as the prospects for the chemical and shipping market remain challenging due to an oversupply of vessels.  In March, MISC entered into a share sale and purchase agreement to dispose of its unit, MISC Integrated Logistics Sdn Bhd, to Golden Age Logistics Sdn Bhd, a special-purpose vehicle wholly owned by Utusan Printcorp Sdn Bhd for RM250 million. Kenanga Research in a note recently said the disposal was not surprising as MISC had been looking to divest its non-core and non-performing assets.  Last week, international shipping publication TradeWinds quoted brokers as saying that the MISC tankers reportedly up for sale are the STX-built Bunga Akasia and Bunga Alamanda (both built in 2009), Bunga Allium, Bunga Angsana, Bunga Angelica, Bunga Azalea and Bunga Aster (all built in 2010). In April, MISC sold four 45,000-dwt B-class medium-range (MR) tankers to United Arab Chemical Carriers (UACC) of Dubai and three 19,800-dwt K-class stainless steel chemical tankers to Sinochem International Co Ltd. MISC is estimated to have collected US$200 million from the disposals. Once all the A-class vessels are sold, MISC will no longer own any chemical tankers, reported TradeWinds. The company will then be left with only six 19,000-dwt L-class chemical tankers in its fleet that are on long-term charters with Japanese trading-house interests. According to the report in TradeWinds, these vessels are said to be mostly used in the palm oil trade. \\u201cFour years ago, MISC laid out a strategy roadmap that was aimed at stabilising the financial performance of the group and rebuilding the strength of our balance sheet. \\u201cThe global financial crisis and prolonged downturn in the shipping sector has forced us to re-examine our past objectives and strategies,\\u201d MISC chairman Datuk Manharlal Ratilal said in the company\\u2019s 2013 annual report. MISC has been forced to re-think the meaning of business resilience, which has given birth to its business portfolio and asset rebalancing strategy, he added. In 2011, MISC discontinued its container shipping business which had resulted in losses of US$789 million (RM2.52 billion) over three years. Last year, MISC\\u2019s controlling shareholder Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) wanted to take the shipping giant private at RM5.50 per share but its attempt failed.  The shipping company\\u2019s stock continued to climb in a bumpy ride following the failed privatisation exercise. It marched to a 3\\u00bd-year high of RM7 in mid-March this year before retreating to RM6.18 last Friday.  The renewed interest in MISC is mainly driven by its improved earnings performance in the past three financial quarters.  For the first quarter ended March 31, 2014 MISC\\u2019s net profit jumped nearly 62% to RM486.3 million from RM300.4 million in the previous corresponding quarter. Earnings per share expanded to 10.9 sen from 6.7 sen. Revenue, however, fell slightly to RM2.29 billion from RM2.37 billion.  MISC attributed the decrease in revenue to lower revenue at its heavy engineering division, as projects in hand neared completion with low value of outstanding progress billings while new projects were in the early stages of construction. Its chemical business recorded lower revenue from the smaller fleet of operating vessels.

But then we decided that perhaps it\\u2019s something that we will look into in the future, rather than now,\\u201d said Hassan in an interview with\\u00a0The Edge Financial Daily. \\u201cThe name itself [risk service contract] says it\\u2019s not a bed of roses,\\u201d he added. Rather, Hassan said Bumi Armada will focus on its core competency, that of a floating solutions provider. \\u201cBesides, we are selective because we want to compete on competency, rather than price. We can add tremendous amount of value [to the jobs we procure]. \\u201cOur game is to be selective and create value,\\u201d he added. Bumi Armada can be fastidious with local jobs. Though Hassan said he is keen to partner with Petronas and has done so, Bumi Armada\\u2019s revenue from its Malaysian operations averaged only 22.09% for the past three years. \\u201cWe have operations in 19 countries across five continents. A lot of our revenue comes from Africa, Central Asia, Angola and Brazil,\\u201d he said. Nonetheless, with Malaysia being Bumi Armada\\u2019s backyard, Hassan said the group is a good partner to Petronas and is keen to work with the state-owned giant. \\u201cWe\\u2019re capable and we are financially sound and we can add tremendous value to them. We are keen to work with them,\\u201d he said. Bumi Armada\\u2019s financials for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014 (1QFY14) showed it had a net gearing of 0.86 times, when imputing total borrowings of RM4.55 billion minus cash and cash equivalents worth RM744.22 million. Its total equity stood at RM4.41 billion. Hassan believes that a gearing level of below one times is \\u201cprudent\\u201d. Thus, to partly fund its capital expenditure (capex) in the coming years, Bumi Armada has opted to make a cash call instead. On Monday, the group announced a combination of rights and bonus issues, in which Bumi Armada is seeking to raise up to RM2.25 billion through the former, largely for its capex programme of RM1.76 billion. Hassan said Bumi Armada will undertake a fleet-renewal programme of a \\u201cpremium level\\u201d in order to meet the requirements of the international markets. \\u201cSome of the vessels are getting older. Today, there is a lot of concern on fuel efficiency and carbon emissions. With the fleet renewal, we come into the market with new requirements, which will most likely be high-end vessels. \\u201cIn the North Sea, for example, there is what is called emission control. If you can\\u2019t satisfy a certain level (of emission level), you can\\u2019t even come in. It\\u2019s the same with Australia, the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil. We need to be a part of this,\\u201d said Hassan. Going forward, he sees Bumi Armada operating a smaller fleet, though it will be of the high-end kind. The group plans to purchase five new vessels this year. Currently, there are 52 vessels in its fleet with 12 earmarked for renewal. \\u201cTo service the industry, we want about 60-plus vessels comprising a mix of vessels, instead of just offshore support vessels (OSVs) to give us more leverage in the market,\\u201d said Hassan. A total of RM80 million has been allocated for its OSV division. Meanwhile, the bulk of the capex portion \\u2013 at RM1.4 billion \\u2013 from its proposed one-for-two rights issue proceeds will be used for its floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) segment. In a report dated May 26, 2014, Maybank IB Research said while there is setback at its OSV operations, the proposed rights issue reflects much optimism on its FPSO division. The research house noted that Bumi Armada had submitted four FPSO bids in Ghana, Mexico, Namibia and Indonesia. They are worth US$3 billion (RM9.66 billion) in capex and there are six more bids in the pipeline with capex of US$10 billion. Maybank has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on Bumi Armada at RM3.90, with a target price of RM4.55. This indicates a 25% upside on its closing price of RM3.64 yesterday.

CEO Derek Wong tells The Edge that Malton Bhd, the company\\u2019s partner in the 50-acre joint development in Bukit Jalil, dubbed \\u201cPavilion 2\\u201d, has started selling the shopoffices \\u2014 sales that Ho Hup can book into its results for its second quarter ending June 30. \\u201cThat will be the maiden quarter in which we will recognise revenue from our JV with Malton,\\u201d he remarks. He did not give a figure, but highlights the fact that the share of revenue Ho Hup will collect from the JV is as good as a profit because the company does not have to pay for the development of \\u201cPavilion 2\\u201d. Under the JV agreement, Malton is bearing the entire development cost while Ho Hup is providing the land \\u2014 carried at only RM55.20 psf in its books \\u2014 and is entitled to 18% of the project\\u2019s gross development value (GDV) of an estimated RM4.2 billion. Malton, which is controlled by tycoon Datuk Desmond Lim, has yet to officially launch \\u201cPavilion 2\\u201d, much less name it, but Wong says launches have been planned for the end of the year.  In fact, Malton held a preview of the shopoffices in March and April, which saw encouraging response. The first of six blocks of serviced apartments will be launched in the third or fourth quarter.  \\u201cPavilion 2\\u201d comprises shopoffices, offices, a hotel, six blocks of high-rise serviced apartments and a retail mall the size of which could rival Mid Valley Megamall\\u2019s with two million sq ft of net lettable area. The mall, in which Ho Hup will hold 18% equity interest for recurring income, is not for sale.  \\u201cThe launch by Malton will be successful. This JV project will give constant recurring income to Ho Hup for the next 8 to 10 years,\\u201d says Wong. In fact, \\u201cPavilion 2\\u201d is the jewel in Ho Hup\\u2019s crown. Three to four years ago, its GDV was said to be only RM2.1 billion, but now, thanks to Malton\\u2019s plan for a huge mall, it has doubled, increasing Ho Hup\\u2019s share of the project to RM756 million. Reflecting the bright prospects for \\u201cPavilion 2\\u201d, Ho Hup\\u2019s total market capitalisation last Thursday \\u2014 comprising the market value of its shares of RM328.5 million (the stock closed at RM1.43), irredeemable convertible preference shares of RM95.2 million and redeemable convertible preference shares of RM75 million \\u2014 stood at RM499 million. Ho Hup also has 51 million warrants outstanding with an exercise price of 60 sen each. They closed at RM1.08 last Thursday. Nevertheless, Wong says Ho Hup has more to offer than \\u201cPavilion 2\\u201d \\u2014 the company is developing 10 acres in Bukit Jalil that are adjacent to \\u201cPavilion 2\\u201d that do not come under the JV with Malton. The GDV for this project could be over RM1 billion. Thus far, Ho Hup has launched projects with a GDV of close to RM400 million, comprising shopoffices, small offices/versatile offices and super corner retail floors with an unbilled amount of RM317.5 million as at the end of April. The launch of a few more blocks of high-rises is also in the works. Initial development of the 10 acres has contributed to Ho Hup\\u2019s profits even before it has recognised any revenue from its JV with Malton.  In the first quarter ended March 31, 2014, Ho Hup posted a net profit of RM11.31 million or 6.66 sen a share on revenue of RM82.42 million. Property development contributed RM13.03 million to operating profit, construction RM727,000 and ready mixed concrete RM139,000. Wong says the current property market climate is difficult for developers, not because there are no buyers, but because the banks are being very strict with their financing requirements. However, cancellations have been replaced with new bookings, proving that the 10-acre project is doing well, he reckons.  \\u201cProperty development is Ho Hup\\u2019s core business going forward. Cash flow from it will be used for future landbanking and working capital for our construction division.\\u201d  Ho Hup is also planning to expand its portfolio of construction jobs, which now comprise largely infrastructure contracts in Iraq and an integrated army complex in Johor. As at April 30, the division\\u2019s order book stood at RM591.2 million with an unbilled amount of RM469.9 million. The company has also bid for a RM300 million water treatment plant deal in Malaysia and RM3.6 billion worth of jobs overseas. According to Wong, Ho Hup\\u2019s new business model in construction revolves around JVs and partnerships. \\u201cAs the company is stable now, we are being invited to bid for some very interesting projects because of our past track record. [Ho Hup had participated in major projects like the North-South Expressway and the Petronas Twin Towers.]  \\u201cWe haven\\u2019t had any big breakthroughs yet, but we are gearing up and going for key government infrastructure jobs that we would love to be involved in,\\u201d he says, citing opportunities in Pengerang, MRT Line 2 and 3, and hydroelectric dam projects in Sarawak.  In fact, Ho Hup has formed a consortium with international players to bid for a hydroelectric dam project in the Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy. The bid is still in the pre-qualification stage.  \\u201cAs long as we target government-related infrastructure jobs, there is no issue of financing [from banks],\\u201d says Wong.  Wong: The launch by Malton will be successful. This JV project will give constant recurring income to Ho Hup for the next 8 to 10 years. On the company\\u2019s chances of getting the jobs it has bid for, he says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not easy. If we get them, it\\u2019s a bonus. If we don\\u2019t get them, we still have Iraq, where we are hopeful of getting about US$100 million worth of contracts per year.\\u201d  On the ready mixed concrete division, Wong says the company will continue to operate the business, although its profit contribution is small. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a business we won\\u2019t let go because it\\u2019s very sentimental to us, having been a source of cash flow in our bad times.\\u201d In fact, in absolute amounts (revenue), the company intends to grow this segment. With the completion of its financial regularisation exercise, Ho Hup now has a clean slate with zero borrowings. And with shareholder tussles, legal disputes and PN17 status for almost six years now behind it, the company can look forward to a fresh start. \\u201cWe have many happy shareholders now,\\u201d says Wong, who is also an indirect substantial shareholder of the company.

On the fertilisers and methanol segment, the company said the segment\\u2019s performance was affected by gas supply constraints as a result of extended upstream facilities shutdown to conduct offshore technical works in securing additional future gas supply. In addition, the segment undertook statutory turnaround activities at its urea plant in Bintulu. Plant utilisation was 67% compared to 88% a year ago. With softer prices for fertilisers and lower volumes for methanol, revenue for the segment decreased by 25% to RM1.0 billion and profit declined by 38% to RM242 million. Petronas Chemicals said its heavy statutory turnaround and maintenance activities at its various plants, which started in the third quarter of 2013, are expected to be substantially completed in the second quarter this year. Going forward, the group said its operations will be mainly affected by fluctuations in international petrochemical product prices, global economic conditions and utilisation rate of its production facilities. For its olefins and derivatives segment, the group said that its products will be influenced by the GDP growth in Asia-Pacific and economic recovery in the US and Europe, while steady global demand should support its fertilisers and methanol segment.

The Edge Weekly in its cover story said that the RM200 billion worth of jobs in the pipeline for the next 20 years had been carrots for investors and driven up valuations. However, as the government nears the end of its fiscal rope and the property market slows down, investors will have to reassess the potential risk of delays in these mega projects, it said. It said that although the short and mid-term fundamentals of most of the construction players are still intact and they have sizeable order books to keep them busy until the end of next year, the problem is that many of the mega-projects in the pipeline would not be awarded anytime soon. Citing Gadang Holdings Bhd major shareholder and managing director Tan Sri Kok Onn, the Edge said that the only major projects that will go ahead this year were those of Petronas in the form of RAPID and RAPID Phase 2. It said the RM60 billion RAPID (Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development) project that falls under the Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex recently received the final investment decision from Petroliam Nasional Bhd and Kok expects several of its packages to be awarded in the next six months, including the co-generation power plant and the infrastructure jobs that Gadang was bidding for. However, the bulk of the RAPID project\\u2019s cost will go to the oil and gas players and equipment suppliers with only a small slice for civil and infrastructure works. Thus, some economists are expecting the construction sector to grow at a slower pace than the consensus forecast of 10% this year, it said. The weekly said infrastructure projects accounted for 20.4% of new construction contracts in 2013, down from an average of 31.4% from 2007 to 2013. Looking ahead, no tenders will be awarded for the massive RM25 billion second Klang Valley Mass Rapid Transit line soon, although the Cabinet approved the project last month, it added. The weekly noted that project manager MRT Corp has said tenders for the rail project will only be called next year after the public display, environmental impact assessment, land acquisitions and fine-tuning of the alignment have been completed. It is highly unlikely that a project this size and with high multiplier value will be scrapped, but a lengthy delay could be costly. Players like Gamuda Bhd and MMC Corp Bhd have invested heavily in 10 tunnel-boring machines for Line One. The equipment makes the MMC-Gamuda partnership a strong contender for the next tunnelling package, but it could mean expensive holding costs if there is no timely deployment of the machines, say industry observers. Following the government\\u2019s cooling measures, the residential property market is expected to see a slowdown. And given that 30% of new contracts came from residential projects last year, any weakening will have a substantial impact on the sector. The weekly also quoted RHB Research Institute\\u2019s chief economist Lim Chee Sing as saying that potential homebuyers were also facing hurdles in securing bank financing with loan rejection rates potentially as high as 30% based on recent reports. As a result, there could be a delay in the rolling- out of several mega property developments planned in the Klang Valley because these are highly dependent on market demand to get off the ground, it said. The RM50 billion development by the EPF\\u2019s wholly-owned Kwasa Land Sdn Bhd on the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia\\u2019s (RRIM) 2,330 acres in the heart of the Klang Valley could be the largest to be affected, noted the weekly. However, despite the slowdown in the near term, longer-term support for the industry remains intact, said the weekly. \\u201cLooking ahead, the fundamental drivers remain supportive of the construction sector amid continued fiscal consolidation. Progress in existing projects in the transport, utility, highway, power plant and oil and gas sectors as well as housing development projects should ensure the sector expands at a healthy pace,\\u201d it quoted CIMB Research\\u2019s chief economist Lee Heng Guie as saying. The weekly in its analysis pointed out that the KL Construction Index had climbed 20% in the past 12 months after construction stocks found with investors again following the general election in May last year. It said the rise was much higher than the FBM KLCI\\u2019s gain of 9% over the same period, indicating strong interest in the sector amid expectation of a steady stream of contracts, which would boost their order books. \\u201cSo, will the rally go on?\\u201d asked the weekly. Despite several analysts expressing bullish views on the sector, the weekly explained that not all was rosy for construction stocks when one looked beyond the long list of construction jobs in the pipeline. As the rally in property and oil and gas stocks appears to have lost steam this year, some say investors may turn to the construction sector because of its attractive fundamentals, it said.

Affin IB Vice President and Head of Retail Research Dr Nazri Khan said that going forward, he expected firmer market action after the local stock market advanced for the third straight month on relatively good volume (gaining a total of 96 points or 5.4% since 4th February 2014). He said the FBM KLCI should resume its upward path as bulls took heart from reduced Ukraine tension, lower prospects for a shift in Fed's tapering bias, a recovering USA economy (positive report on USA retail sales registering the largest gain in 18 months), rising commodity prices and more liquidity boost from the Bank of China and European Central Bank \\u201cOn the technical front, despite Friday weakness, the FBM KLCI has scored its sixth successive daily rise, the longest run of daily gains since 1st March 2014. \\u201cAs for strategy, traders should look towards the start of a new upleg and aggressively position for momentum market leaders namely construction (ETP Play), properties (ETP Play) and technology stocks (USA Recovery Play) which include our Top Ten Picks i.e. Matrix, Ecoworld, MKLand, Bertam, IJM, Muhibah, Mitra, Willow, Gtronic and Granflo. \\u201cAggressive traders might also consider capitalising on upside volatility by purchasing global index futures or accumulating medium term USA index call options,\\u201d he said.

Recall that we had previously pared our earnings forecast due to slower domestic project execution as well as the impact from US anti-dumping duties levied on the country in October 2013. As a result for the two above-mentioned factors, Pantech\\u2019s earnings in the second half (2HFY14) were weaker than that in 1HFY14.  Sales in the latest 4QFY14 dropped 18.3% year-on-year (y-o-y) and 2.5% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) to RM127.8 million. For the full year, sales were down 9.8% to RM574.9 million \\u2014 led by a 19.4% decline in trading sales. Manufacturing sales managed a 4.8% gain, thanks to a robust 1HFY14, before the anti-dumping duties came into effect. With this increase, manufacturing accounted for a higher 46% of total sales in FY14, up from 40% in FY13. Net profit for FY14 was up just 1.4% to RM55.8 million. Again, earnings for the full year were dragged down by a weaker 2H \\u2014 net profit grew 9% y-o-y in 1HFY14 but fell 5% y-o-y in 2HFY14. Positively, net profit in 4QFY14 recovered to RM14.6 million, up from RM12.1 million in 3QFY14 \\u2014 despite the slight 2.5% decline in sales. We attribute the better margin to a more favourable product mix.  Better margins on higher value added products For instance, since the US imposed anti-dumping duties on stainless steel pipes, Pantech has shifted production to fittings, which have better margins. Production for the latter has since quadrupled. As a result, although the anti-dumping duties are a setback for the stainless steel plant, it still managed to generate a small profit in FY14 \\u2014 compared to start-up losses in FY13. The stainless steel plant is currently running at roughly 80% capacity. Sales at UK-based Nautic Steel also carry higher margins on value-added niche products like copper nickel and nickel alloy pipes and fittings. The company has also focused on producing higher margin products \\u2014 such as long bends \\u2014 at the carbon steel plant for both local and export markets. Expanding global footprint Notably, Pantech has made good inroads in the export markets. Its products, led by those manufactured by Nautic, are approved by many of the oil majors. Export sales accounted for 49% of total sales in FY14, up from 31% in FY11. Stronger margins and earnings from manufacturing offset lower contributions from the trading arm in FY14. Aside from lower sales, the slow project execution in the domestic oil and gas sector also resulted in a less favourable product mix for Pantech\\u2019s trading unit as it turned to other sectors to make up the slack. Positive longer-term outlook Despite the near-term setback \\u2014 due to reasons mentioned above \\u2014 we remain sanguine on Pantech\\u2019s longer-term growth prospects. The company is cautiously optimistic that project flow in the domestic oil and gas market will regain traction in 2H of 2014 \\u2014 rejuvenated by Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u2019s approval of the final investment decision for the US$26 billion (RM84.8 billion) Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) project.  For instance, Barakah Offshore Petroleum has just won a RM260 million contract to lay gas pipeline to PIC. Work for the contract is to commence immediately. The oil and gas sector remains a key focus area under the Economic Transformation Programme. Petronas is expected to spend over RM300 billion in capital expenditure between 2011 and 2015.  Crude oil prices have been holding steady for the past few years. This will continue to support global oil and gas exploration and production activities. Expanding capacity on expectations of rising demand To cater to expectations of rising demand, including that from the PIC, Pantech is planning to buy more equipment for the carbon steel plant this year. This will raise production capacity to 21,000 tonnes per annum, from the current 18,500 tonnes. The plant is currently running at full capacity. With the new equipment, Pantech can further expand its product range and strengthen its position as the largest one-stop centre for pipes, fittings and flow control products in the country. Last year, Pantech acquired a second plot of land near Nautic\\u2019s existing factory and has installed new equipment to expand product range, which will include nickel alloy items such as duplex and super duplex. Utilisation stands at about 75% following the capacity increase \\u2014 supportive of growth over the next year or two. The expansion also includes extra warehousing space.  Capital expenditure is now estimated at about RM24 million in FY15, lower than that in FY14 but higher than our previous estimate \\u2014 after taking into account spending for new equipment for the carbon steel plant. Growth to gain traction in FY16 We forecast slower sales growth of about 6% for FY15, with gradually stronger demand going into the second half of the year. Sales growth should pick up in FY16, estimated at about 15%.  Net profit growth, however, is expected to outpace sales increase on expectations that the margins improvement in 2HFY14 will continue into FY15.  Thus, net profit is estimated at RM62.4 million, up 12% for the current financial year, and to expand further to RM73.7 million in FY16.  Pantech\\u2019s valuations remain attractive relative to the oil and gas sector as well as the broader market. The stock is now trading at price-earnings multiples of 9.1 and 7.7 times our estimated earnings for FY15 and FY16 respectively.  The company has some 74.8 million warrants \\u2014 with exercise price of 60 sen and a long expiry, in December 2020 \\u2014 and 34.3 million irredeemable convertible unsecured loan stock outstanding. Even on a fully diluted basis, the stock is still modestly valued at roughly 10.2 and 8.7 times our estimated earnings for FY15 and FY16\\u00a0 respectively. Strengthening balance sheet supportive of dividends Of note, Pantech\\u2019s balance has been strengthening over the past year, with major expansions completed \\u2014 the acquisition of Nautic and commissioning of the stainless steel plant. Gearing dropped to 31% at end-FY14, from 47% in FY13. With improved cash flow, we forecast gearing to fall further over the next few years \\u2014 barring any new acquisition. As such, we expect Pantech can comfortably maintain a fairly generous dividend payout. Dividends totalled 4.4 sen per share in FY14, or equivalent to about 45% of net profit.  Assuming a similar payout level, dividends will total some five sen per share for the current financial year and 5.9 sen in FY16. These will earn shareholders higher than market average net yields of 5% and 5.9% at the current share price for the two years respectively. In all, we remain upbeat that Pantech can offer shareholders prospects of longer-term growth on top of attractive yields.

It is understood that the three companies are currently evaluating data for a cluster of fields before making a selection. \"The [joint-venture and shareholding] structure will be formed once the data is shown to be positive, after which an award by Petronas will follow,\" an industry source says. If all goes well, the award of the RSC will likely be made in July or August this year, the source adds. Executives of Petra Energy were tight-lipped when contacted, while Vestigo CEO Keith Collins could not be contacted. The RSC award would contribute positively to the earnings of the companies involved. Petra Energy's largest shareholder is Tan Sri Bustari Yusuf, who has an almost 27.5% stake in the company. Its other shareholders include Wah Seong Corp Bhd with 26.9%, Lembaga Tabung Haji with 9.9% and Datuk Mohamed Nizam Abdul Razak - the brother of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak - with 9.1%. Vestigo is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petronas, while Coastal Energy is wholly owned by Compania Espanola de Petroleos SA, also known as Cepsa. At one time, the family of flamboyant young businessman Low Taek Jho @ Jho Low was also a partner of Cepsa via Strategic Resources (Global) Ltd when Coastal Energy was taken over late last year, but his family's block appears to have been taken over by Cepsa. Vestigo holds the RSC for the Tembikai field, off the coast of Terengganu, which was awarded at end-March this year. Meanwhile, its joint venture with SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd (SKP) is slated to bag the RSC for the Bubu field. Thus, the latest RSC from Petronas could either be its second or third, if successful. A second RSC for Coastal-Petra JV Coastal Energy and Petra Energy already have a 70:30 joint-venture company called Coastal Energy KBM Sdn Bhd. The JV company is developing the Kapal, Banag and Meranti (KBM) cluster of oilfields after being awarded the contract by Petronas in late June 2012. Late last year, the Kapal field - located off the shores of Peninsular Malaysia - struck oil, with the initial production estimated at between 10,000 barrels per day (bpd) and a peak of 13,000 bpd. According to industry players, this RSC has put Coastal Energy and Petra Energy in a good light as work was done within budget and the time frame taken was only slightly off schedule. In contrast, other RSCs - for the Berantai cluster, awarded to SKP and Petrofac Ltd, and for the Balai cluster, held by a consortium made up of ROC Oil of Australia, Dialog Group Bhd and Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd - have had to grapple with several issues. In July 2013, it was reported that there was a six-month delay in the Balai cluster due to bad weather and changes in the conversion of the early production vessel known as Balai Mutiara. Earnings found wanting The success of the KBM cluster has not been reflected in Petra Energy's financials as it only struck oil late last year. For the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2013, Petra Energy suffered a net loss of RM1.1 million on sales of RM159.4 million. In its notes, the company attributes the bleeding to an impairment loss of RM8.9 million. For the financial year ended Dec 31, 2013, its net profit rose 56% to RM11.7 million, although revenue fell 24.7% to RM492.8 million.  It is also noteworthy that for FY2013, Petra Energy's net cash flow from operating activities was a negative RM71.5 million. Meanwhile, its finance cost for the year was RM12 million, a tad higher than its net profit. As at end-December last year, the company had cash and bank balances of RM112.3 million while its long-term borrowings stood at RM106.3 million and short-term debt commitments were RM94.4 million. In the notes to the financials, Petra Energy says, \"The oil and gas industry is slated for sustained growth over the next three to five years in both the offshore and onshore sectors. \"The government's focus on domestic oil and gas production by enhancing oil recovery, developing small fields and increasing exploration activities to locate new fields is one of the key growth areas that would positively impact the Petra Energy group.\" In a note released after the company's financial results were announced, RHB Research Institute says FY2014 may be the year Petra Energy sees its earnings turn around. The research house forecasts that Petra Energy will register a net profit of RM52.2 million on revenue of RM947 million in the current financial year. Petra Energy closed at RM2.54 last Friday.

Petronas executive vice-president of exploration and production Datuk Wee Yiaw Hin said the agreement was signed\\u00a0 during the conference. However, no details were revealed. We understand that the fifth RSC might refer to the Tanjung Baram field which requires capital expenditure (capex) of approximately US$100 million (RM326 million). With the assumption of: (i) US$100 million capex; (ii) project internal rate of return (IRR) of 20%; and (iii) project stake of 30%, we estimate that it will contribute approximately RM14 million or 11 sen per share to Uzma\\u2019s bottom line once production begins. To stay conservative, we do not include the potential RSC award in our forecasts. Any marginal field contract win will rerate the stock and transform the company into an exploration and production (E&P) player. We are positive and this is in line with our expectation. In our report titled 2014 Outlook \\u2014 What\\u2019s next?, dated Jan 9, 2014, we had mentioned Uzma as a beneficiary of the RSC contract award.To recap, Uzma recently proposed a renounceable rights issue of up to 132 million rights shares on the basis of one rights share for every one existing share, which is expected to raise up to RM90 million. We believe the funds raised will be used for potential special project(s) such as marginal fields and enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Oil revenue remains vital and forms a major part of the government\\u2019s revenue. Hence, one of the best solutions to increase oil production is through EOR.

The group expects to file the paperwork with the Securities Commission Malaysia in the third quarter of this year. \\u201cWe expect the approval to be obtained by year-end and go public thereafter, subject to market conditions,\\u201d group executive director Rosthman Ibrahim, who is not related to Shahrani\\u2019s family, told The Edge Financial Daily in an interview. Shapadu Corp\\u2019s interest in the O&G business is held under four wholly-owned units \\u2014 Shapadu Energy & Engineering Sdn Bhd, Shapadu Energy Services Sdn Bhd, Labuan-based Shapadu Marine Pte Ltd and Shapadu Marine Sdn Bhd. For the purpose of listing, the four subsidiaries will be demerged from Shapadu Corp and transferred to a special purpose vehicle (NewCo). Meanwhile, the group\\u2019s non-O&G businesses \\u2014 property development and logistic services \\u2014 will remain with Shapadu Corp. The demerger will consist of an in-specie distribution of NewCo shares to Shapadu Corp shareholders. \\u201cThe NewCo will undertake the IPO and apply to list on Bursa Malaysia. Shapadu Energy & Engineering will anchor the NewCo,\\u201d Rosthman explained. As part of the IPO plan, Rosthman said the group is also pursuing a \\u201ccollaborative agreement\\u201d with a third party \\u2014 a company operating in the O&G industry but in a different segment, for major investment into the NewCo. He declined to reveal the company\\u2019s name, except to say that it is listed overseas.  Formal documentation for the collaboration is expected to be signed in the second quarter of this year. \\u201cThe collaboration is with a view to improving our [O&G division\\u2019s] profit margins and boosting our bottom line performance. Once we have better margins, obviously we will get better valuation [for our IPO]. Obviously we don\\u2019t want it (IPO) to be too small,\\u201d he added. Currently, Shapadu Energy & Engineering, which makes up the bulk of the group\\u2019s O&G revenue, has a paid-up capital of RM12 million and shareholders\\u2019 funds totaling RM70 million. The company specialises in the hook-up and commissioning segment of the O&G industry. This will not be the first IPO for Shapadu Corp. The last time the group had its unit listed was when container haulage outfit Shapadu Kontena Bhd made its debut on the stock exchange in 1992. Shapadu Kontena was renamed DiPerdana Holdings Bhd in 1995, and was later sold to Konsortium Logistik Bhd in 2005. Talk of Shapadu Corp coming back into the corporate limelight surfaced in 2007 when it was linked to the takeover of Malaysian Merchant Marine Bhd, but this did not materialise. Then in 2010, speculation surfaced that the group might take over loss-making Vastalux Energy Bhd. This was after Rosthman \\u2014 who was then Shapadu Corp\\u2019s executive director of finance \\u2014 and Mohamad Hasif Mohd Nahar \\u2014 who was head of procurement at Shapadu Energy & Engineering before he resigned in February that year \\u2014 were appointed directors of Vastalux. \\u201cOriginally we (Shapadu) had planned for a reverse takeover of Vastalux, but we found out that we were not ready. The good thing is that since then, we have cleaned up our books to comply with Bursa Malaysia\\u2019s listing requirements and we are now ready [to launch an IPO],\\u201d said Rosthman. According to him, earnings of Shapadu Energy & Engineering had climbed more than 10 times to RM24.24 million for financial year ended Dec 31, 2012 (FY12), from RM2.31 million in FY10. Meanwhile, revenue had risen to RM531.03 million from RM102.1 million for the same period.  The strong growth was driven by projects such as the Tapis Enhanced Oil Recovery project offshore Peninsula, said Rosthman.  However, Shapadu Energy & Engineering saw its net profit fall 9% to RM22.02 million last year, on lower revenue of RM421.95 million, after failing to secure the Pan Malaysia offshore transportation and installation contracts. Nevertheless, Rosthman is confident of achieving a revenue of RM492 million this year, as the company took delivery of two offshore support vessels this month. Going forward, he said Shapadu Energy & Engineering could maintain its annual revenue at around RM500 million.  \\u201cRevenue will remain steady for the next two years, mainly contributed by both offshore and onshore construction contracts that we have secured so far. We managed to secure these contracts from various companies such as Petronas Carigali, ExxonMobil, Talisman Malaysia Ltd, Petrofac (Malaysia-PM304) Ltd and JGC Corp,\\u201d he added. Shapadu Energy & Engineering is currently bidding for O&G contracts worth RM3 billion. \\u201cThese are all local contracts. We have no plans to go overseas yet, simply because we are not ready. In order for us to do so, we reckoned we need to find a reputable partner,\\u201d said its chief executive officer Annuar Tumar.

The group\\u2019s more cyclical earnings from infrastructure construction, cranes and shipbuilding are complemented by stable concession income from the airports in Cambodia and road maintenance contract in Malaysia. Muhibbah\\u2019s earnings will be underpinned by its RM1.82 billion order book, of which 60% is for oil and gas-related projects. The crane unit, Favelle Favco, in particular is seeing strong growth in order book and earnings, with 30% growth in net profit to RM61.7 million in 2013. We expect Muhibbah to post net profit of RM99.7 million in 2014 and RM110.8 million in 2015, with earnings per share of 23.6 sen for 2014 and 26.2 sen for 2015. At RM2.40, the stock\\u2019s price-earnings ratio of 10.2 times for 2014 and 9.1 times for 2015 are attractive, especially relative to its growth prospects, oil and gas and construction peers, and as lower-cost proxies to the O&G sector. As a comparison, large cap O&G stocks like SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd and Bumi Armada Bhd are currently trading at about 20 times earnings for 2014, while smaller ones like Perisai Petroleum Bhd are at 16 times. Most major construction stocks are trading at around 12 times earnings for 2014 \\u2014 although those with property divisions will likely see a dip in earnings in 2015 with the current property slowdown. 2013 results ahead of expectations Muhibbah\\u2019s full year results for 2013 were better than our expectation, and marked a strong turnaround from 2012 when the company fell into the red due to provisions for the Asia Petroleum Hub (APH) project. Full year pre-tax profit came in at RM134 million, 8% above our forecast of RM124 million, while net profit of RM85.2 million was 20% above our original forecast of RM71.2 million. By comparison, the group posted pre-tax and net losses of RM35 million and RM93.2 million, respectively, in 2012 due to provisions for APH. Revenue for 2013 declined 27.6% from RM2.63 billion to RM1.9 billion. Notwithstanding the better overall performance due to the absence of one-off APH provisions, we estimate earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) in 2013 declined 23.4% from RM236.2 million to RM180.8 million, although overall Ebitda margins improved from 9% to 9.5%. This was largely due to the 27.6% drop in revenue following the completion of several large projects, notably the South Klang Valley Expressway, as civil works typically yield lower margins. Share of associates increased 5.3% from RM44.2 million to RM46.5 million, reflecting continued growth in its concession business, notably the Cambodian airports and Malaysian road maintenance concessions. As at Feb 21, Muhibbah\\u2019s outstanding order book stood at RM1.83 billion, down 14% from RM2.13 billion in November 2013. This comprised RM719 million from infrastructure construction, RM1.064 billion from cranes and RM47 million from shipyard. Of this, 27.7% is in Malaysia and the rest overseas, a testament to the group\\u2019s growing international stature. A first and final dividend of 4.5 sen has been proposed, giving shareholders a yield of 1.9%. Good prospects for more jobs Among Muhibbah\\u2019s major outstanding contracts are the Wiggins Island coal terminal export project in Australia (outstanding order book RM192 million), noise barriers and enclosures for MRT Corp (RM147 million), catering facility for the new Doha International Airport (RM105 million), government buildings in Putrajaya (RM47 million), refurbishment of the terminal buildings at Phnom Penh and Siem Reap airports (RM83 million) and steel structure works for the Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) LNG 9 project in Sarawak (RM30 million). Going forward, O&G projects are likely to feature more with the award to Muhibbah in June 2013 of a licence by Petronas as an approved supplier for offshore facilities construction \\u2014 major onshore fabrication. With its complete package of capabilities in building ships, cranes, fabricated structures, pipelines, terminals, tanks and other related works, the group is positioning itself to garner a larger slice of the national oil company\\u2019s captial expenditure (capex). Petronas is expected to spend RM300 billion in capex over the next five years. For the oil and gas sector in 2014,\\u00a0 the factors that will spur spending include: (i) the award of new risk-sharing contracts; (ii) more enhanced oil recovery projects; (iii) contracts for drilling rigs to local contractors; and (iv) the RM60 billion refinery and petrochemical integrated development (Rapid) petrochemical complex in Pengerang, Johor. There had recently been reports that the Rapid project may not meet its final investment decision deadline of March 2014, although the delay is due more to resettlement issues rather than financial viability. Reflecting Muhibbah\\u2019s increasing global status and its ability to clinch major overseas projects, only 28% of its order book is currently for Malaysian projects. This buffers the company against a slowdown in domestic construction activities where competition and margins have been tight. The group hopes its two projects in the Middle East \\u2014 the earlier completed Yemen LNG project and the ongoing Doha International Airport catering facility \\u2014 will open the doors to more projects in the region. Qatar in particular, is investing heavily in infrastructure. On the APH front, there have been no new developments. Any move to revive or restructure the project will benefit Muhibbah in the future in terms of write-backs, as some RM240 million in full provisions were already made in 2012. Muhibbah\\u2019s Cambodian airport operations offer attractive exposure to Cambodia\\u2019s economy, with gross domestic product growth of 7.2% to 7.5% per year until 2015, supported by the strong tourism and textile industries. The airport operations are 30% owned through a joint venture with the French Vinci group, and the concessions last until 2040. In 2013, the Phnom Penh and Siem Reap airports combined registered 18% growth in total passenger arrivals to 5.07 million, following an already strong 17% growth in arrivals to 4.3 million in 2012. The Phnom Penh airport saw a 15% growth in arrivals to 2.39 million while the Siem Reap airport\\u2019s arrivals rose 20% to 2.66 million. Future growth will come from expansion of the two airports, as well as increased flights at the new third airport concession in Sihanoukville, the gateway to southern Cambodia\\u2019s beaches and islands, textile manufacturing base and newly discovered O&G deposits.

For this to happen, more money will have to be invested outside the retirement savings manager\\u2019s conventional staple of government bonds and blue chips, and in relatively riskier assets at home and abroad. Its global assets doubled in the past three years to reach over RM120 billion or 20.97% of total investment assets as at end-2013. The EPF is allowed to invest 23% of its funds outside Malaysia and there is a good chance it will hit this ceiling in 2015, if not this year, say experts. Without going into the specifics of what the new ceiling for overseas investments should be, Shahril, 44, says it will have to \\u201cgradually go up\\u201d to give the fund greater flexibility in its investment options.  \\u201cWhen emerging markets were being sold down in the second half of 2013, our investments in developed markets worked well for us \\u2026 gains there helped provided some buffer,\\u201d he says, explaining how income from the EPF\\u2019s overseas investments is also hedged to protect against currency fluctuations. \\u201cThat\\u2019s one of the many things we do to give us some level of certainty on the amount of returns we generate.\\u201d As for the suspicion that the EPF supports the local stock market, Shahril \\u2014 who had joined the pension fund in December 2009 as deputy CEO in charge of the investments division before assuming the CEO\\u2019s chair last April \\u2014 has this to say: \\u201cThere is no particular level that we think the market should be at \\u2026 For a [large] fund like us, liquidity becomes an issue \\u2026 Managing a RM200 billion fund is very different from managing a RM200 million fund \\u2026 This is why you will often find that we are a buyer when there are many sellers [in the market] and a seller when there are many buyers.\\u201d  While it has a long investment horizon, the EPF constantly evaluates its portfolio to carry the best holdings because it pays dividends annually from realised income, he explains.  \\u201cThis is why if we think there is not much upside left, we will sometimes accept [lower] offers that we think are a decent price for us to exit at because we cannot get that price in the open market,\\u201d Shahril says when asked about the rationale behind the EPF\\u2019s acceptance of Petronas\\u2019 offer for MISC Bhd that some parties saw as low. Shahril: Managing a RM200 billion fund is very different from managing a RM200 million fund. This is why the EPF is a buyer when there are many sellers and a seller when there are many buyers. He probably would not be surprised to face opposition to the EPF putting more money into alternative assets locally and abroad, but prefers to let the results speak for themselves. When the EPF flagged the possibility of lower dividends for 2013 due to global volatility, some critics deemed that to be a result of the EPF being tapped to support the local equity market as foreigners pulled out from emerging markets, including Malaysia.Instead, the EPF on Feb 16 announced another record-high dividend payout \\u2014 6.35% \\u2014 which was the highest since the 6.84% announced in 1999. Still, after five straight years of dividend growth, even those in favour of the EPF\\u2019s investment diversification wonder if the growth can be sustained as global uncertainties persist. To be sure, with the EPF\\u2019s fund size set to exceed the RM600 billion mark this year, its managers are forced to work harder to deliver at least the targeted minimum annual return of 2% above inflation. Total investments had increased from RM341.01 billion as at end-2008 to RM586.66 billion as at end-2013. In line with the growth, to pay 1% dividend to its members, the amount the EPF needs has grown by an average 9.12% a year over the past five years from RM3.18 billion in 2008 to RM4.91 billion in 2013. It only needed RM1.68 billion to do the same a decade ago in 2003, when total investments hovered near the RM200 billion mark. Higher allocation to equitiesA closer look at the EPF\\u2019s asset allocation over the past five years shows a higher proportion of assets is going into equities while additional investments in fixed income, particularly corporate loans and bonds, has been lower. Investments in equities had grown from 25.7% of total investment assets in 2008 to 43% (RM252.14 billion) in 2013, which was up from RM203.9 billion (38.7% of total investments) in 2012 and RM87.9 billion in 2008, data in the EPF\\u2019s annual report shows. By comparison, investments in fixed income (MGS and corporate loans and bonds) had declined to 52.34% in 2013 from 68.25% in 2008, although absolute amounts rose to RM307.1 billion from RM233.4 billion over the period. It should be noted that equities contributed RM19.5 billion or 55.76% to the EPF\\u2019s RM35 billion gross investment income in 2013, up from 34.84% in 2008 when it earned RM6.67 billion. Fixed-income investments contributed 39.19% to total investment income last year compared with 61.17% in 2008. The EPF\\u2019s success in equities, which are seen as higher risk assets than quality fixed-income paper, will likely be closely watched.   As it is, the EPF, ranked the sixth largest pension fund in Asia and the 12th globally by assets under management in 2012 by Tower Watson, is forced to venture abroad so as to not crowd out other local players and to diversify its portfolio. Despite its participation in several high-profile deals \\u2014 from the \\u00a38 billion, 15-year Battersea Power Station redevelopment project with S P Setia Bhd and Sime Darby Bhd to the RM2.28 billion acquisition of Rubber Research Institute land from the government to be turned into the Kwasa Damansara township \\u2014 the EPF has invested only RM14.4 billion in real estate and other alternative assets so far. That\\u2019s only 2.45% of its RM586.7 billion total investments as at end-2013 (see tables below).  As for the EPF\\u2019s real estate portfolio in the UK, Shahril estimates that its value is likely worth 10% to 15% more today based purely on yield compression because the EPF was among the earlier foreign investors in London. \\u201cWhen we started three years ago, we could still get yields of 6%.\\u201d  Now, the EPF is scouting around for opportunities in countries like the US and Japan and is likely to enter markets that it does not know very well with strong partners. \\u201cIn Australia, for instance, we have a strong partner in Goodman Group,\\u201d says Shahril. The EPF is also open to lending its financial muscle for a share of real estate that can provide steady income flow in the future, such as malls or office blocks. Due to the size of the EPF\\u2019s funds, income generation from these projects is likely to remain small relative to its total income base for some time. Nonetheless, the strategy should pay off once some of the larger developments, like Battersea and Kwasa Damansara, where the EPF is targeting a stake in retail and commercial buildings, mature. Whatever the case, more than 90% of its funds is still invested in fixed-income securities and equities and any increase in the money put into alternative assets, including participation in corporate deals such as the privatisation of PLUS Expressways Bhd, KFC Holdings (M) Bhd and Kian Joo Can Factory Bhd, will be opportunistic. \\u201cThere is a lot of attention on these projects because of their physical presence \\u2026 but [even money from land sales] will be small, relatively speaking,\\u201d Shahril points out.  Due to its deep pockets, the EPF gets deal proposals by the dozens, but only a handful that fit in with its investment and risk appetite go through. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve been shareholders of Kian Joo for a long time and we think it is a good business that caters for a diversified client base with steady cash flow,\\u201d says Shahril, explaining the EPF\\u2019s preference for businesses with strong cash-flow generation capability.  According to him, the EPF\\u2019s investment panel has a very high threshold for even staple investments like corporate debt paper because of the need to preserve capital while delivering decent growth.  \\u201cWe hold most of our debt paper to maturity [for yields] \\u2026 we do not buy anything below investment-grade rating,\\u201d he says, adding that even issuers of A-rated paper are evaluated for their cash flow generation capability and gearing position before an investment is made. He declines comment on whether the EPF will take up some of the RM2.4 billion worth of sukuk currently being sold by 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) to fund the relocation of defence units from the land earmarked for the 196ha Bandar Malaysia development project. In the long run, once the EPF builds a strong track record, as much as 50% of its funds could be invested outside Malaysia if that\\u2019s the best option to deliver growth. For now, Shahril knows a lot of work needs to be done to push the EPF higher among global peers, but he is confident the results will show that the pension fund is on the right track. As Chua Hak Bin, economist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, puts it, some of the domestic capital outflow from Malaysia is a \\u201cstructural trend with Malaysians or institutions diversifying their holdings\\u201d. At least three parcels of RRI land up for tender this yearAt least three parcels of the coveted Rubber Research Institute (RRI) land measuring about 130 acres in total will be up for grabs this year, kick-starting the high-profile, 15-year suburban property project that will contribute to the retirement savings of members of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF). \\u201cBased on the response we\\u2019ve seen so far, we think we\\u2019ll get a bit more than the price we\\u2019re looking for,\\u201d says the pension fund\\u2019s CEO Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan, who, however, declines to disclose the floor price of the plots. Tenders will soon be invited for the first parcel of 70 acres, which will house transport infrastructure and facilities, he adds. The other two parcels, one largely for commercial use and the other for residential use, are between 30 acres and 50 acres each.  \\u201cWe want to control the supply of land into the market,\\u201d says Shahril, adding that periodically, smaller plots of land will be put out to tender to allow smaller players to participate. The EPF\\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary Kwasa Land Sdn Bhd is the master developer of the 2,330-acre RRI land, which will be developed into a township called Kwasa Damansara that will be bigger than Subang Jaya (1,799 acres) and is expected to generate projects worth RM50 billion in gross development value (GDV). Kwasa Land, which reportedly expects to raise RM11 billion from selling 1,350 acres of the RRI land, will take equity in most of the eight precincts available for development. The equity participation will go towards building future income for the EPF. As many as 60 developers have reportedly been pre-qualified for the upcoming tender. Events are already in motion.  In late January this year, Kwasa Land sold two parcels in Sungai Buloh \\u2014 in the vicinity of Kwasa Damansara \\u2014 to Pink Corner Sdn Bhd and TRC Land Sdn Bhd, who were the highest bidders for the parcels that are said to be at \\u201cjust a stone\\u2019s throw from the main township development separated by Jalan Lapangan Terbang Subang\\u201d. Pink Corner paid RM13.07 million or RM70 psf for a 4.28-acre plot while TRC Land paid RM6.13 million or RM82 psf for a 1.717-acre plot. The parcels were tendered on an \\u201cas is, where is\\u201d basis based on agricultural titles, according to a statement by Kwasa Land. Both parcels were sold at 13% and 11% above the reserve price respectively. A total of nine bidders participated in the bids for the parcels that were advertised for sale to bumiputeras only in August 2013.  According to Shahril, more small parcels will be made available for tender in the future to allow a broader group of developers to participate in the development.

Last Thursday, Perwaja announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Perwaja Steel Sdn Bhd, has reached a settlement with Petronas, which it deems an \\u201cimportant milestone in the group\\u2019s recovery and represents a key element in reviving its operations\\u201d.  Meanwhile, sources say Perwaja may also strike a settlement with Tenaga Nasional Bhd for its outstanding electricity bill amounting to almost RM200 million. Reacting to the announcement, investors pushed Perwaja\\u2019s share price up 10.5 sen or 72.4% to close at 25 sen last Friday, putting its market capitalisation at RM140 million. Kinsteel\\u2019s share price gained five sen or 31.25% to 21 sen, raising its market capitalisation to RM281.7 million.  On Wedneday (Feb 19), Perwaja announed Perwaja Steel Sdn Bhd has (PSSB) had signed an agreement with Tenaga Nasional Bhd\\u00a0 (TNB) to settle all outstanding amounts owing by PSSB to TNB in respect of electricity bills for\\u00a0 a total sum of RM176.7 million. Nevertheless, analysts say investors should not celebrate just yet, as the operating environment remains challenging in the steel industry. Furthermore, the group\\u2019s current financial standing does not look bright and there seems to be an immediate crunch. As at Sept 30, 2013, Perwaja\\u2019s balance sheet showed it had overdrafts and short-term borrowings of RM1.36 billion as well as other payables of RM693.12 million, which could include amounts owed to Petronas and Tenaga.  However, inventories and receivables totalled only RM253.99 million (a sharp decline from RM1.1 billion a year ago) and cash and bank balances stood at RM12.22 million, which indicates that it needs fresh working capital to replenish its stock. The group\\u2019s long-term borrowings stood at RM276.43 million. According to its latest quarterly results ended Sept 30, 2013, the group\\u2019s net loss widened to RM227.13 million from RM38.3 million in the previous year. In the second quarter ended June 30, 2013, net loss stood at RM74.12 million.  The group was affected not only by a drop in sales and lower selling price of steel products but also by the gas supply curtailment for two months by Petronas, pending a settlement. \\u00a0 Notwithstanding the generally weak environment in the steel industry, executives familiar with Perwaja are confident that the group will make the instalment payments after the grace period.   \\u201cThe plant will be restarted soon, giving Perwaja enough time during the 18 months to get things running smoothly,\\u201d says an executive.   Perwaja, which is classified under Practice Note 17 (PN17), is in the process of drawing up a regularisation plan. Sources say part of the plan to exit from its PN17 status will require capital injection to strengthen its immediate working capital needs. \\u00a0\\u00a0   As for Kinsteel, which holds a 37.3% stake in Perwaja, it could see losses narrow should Perwaja\\u2019s financial position improve. Currently, Perwaja\\u2019s profits and losses are consolidated into Kinsteel\\u2019s books. \\u00a0  Perwaja and Kinsteel share the same management team, with Tan Sri Pheng Yih Huah as managing director and his son, Datuk Henry Pheng Chin Guan, as CEO.   Kinsteel emerged as Perwaja\\u2019s controlling shareholder in 2006 when it acquired a 51% stake in the company from the Maju Group. In 2008, Kinsteel\\u2019s shareholding in Perwaja was pared down to 37.3% after Perwaja sold new shares to list on Bursa Malaysia. \\u00a0  Kinsteel too has not fared too well in recent times. Its net loss in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2013, widened to RM111.68 million from RM16.44 million a year ago. Like its subsidiary, Kinsteel says, it was affected by low selling prices and a drop in production and sales. \\u00a0 Kinsteel has been registering losses since its financial year ended Dec 31, 2010, and in debt for years. As at Sept 30, 2013, the group\\u2019s total borrowings stood at RM1.93 billion (overdrafts and short-term borrowings at RM1.82 billion and long-term borrowings at RM109.29 million) while cash balances amounted to RM13.33 million.  As global steel prices are expected to remain depressed this year and the local steel industry continues to be mired in the issue of dumping, it could be too early to expect a significant turnaround from Perwaja and Kinsteel, analysts say.\nPerwaja plant ...

But despite their premium valuations, many analysts rate O&G stocks as \\u201coverweight\\u201d due to the strong order books and clear earnings visibility of the companies. The price-earnings ratio of industry leader SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd, for example, is 25.9 times, according to Bloomberg data. By comparison, the local benchmark index\\u2019s PER for CY2014 is 15.71 times.  Mid cap Dialog Group Bhd, meanwhile, was trading at a FY2014 ending June 30 PER of 33.27 times at its close of RM3.26 last Thursday. CIMB Research has a target price of RM6.73 for SapuraKencana, which represents a CY2015 PER of more than 22 times. The stock closed at RM4.48 last Thursday. \\u201cThe valuation is still within the historical PER range of O&G big caps. We maintain our \\u2018add\\u2019 call [on SapuraKencana] with the Newfield [Exploration Company] purchase and strong order book as major re-rating catalysts. SapuraKencana remains a high conviction call and our top pick among the O&G big caps,\\u201d the research house says in a Jan 29 note. Alliance Research vice-president Arhnue Tan, however, believes the 20 to over 30 times PER of O&G stocks cannot be compared with the FBM KLCI\\u2019s teens because the latter\\u2019s 30 component stocks come from various sectors, some of which grow at a slower rate than O&G. \\u201cO&G companies have a 20% to 30% [annual] earnings growth. To compare their PERs with the FBM KLCI\\u2019s would not be fair. Plantation players, for example, grow at a slower annual pace,\\u201d she remarks. Yvonne Tan, Eastspring Investments Bhd\\u2019s chief investment officer of equities, agrees that O&G companies have stronger earnings growth. This, along with strong order books, makes the sector far more attractive than the others, she says. \\u201cOf course, local O&G stocks are trading at a premium compared with their regional peers, but Malaysian funds are mandated to invest in local equities only. The limited pool of local O&G stocks has thus created very high demand for them with local funds more than willing to pay a premium for them.\\u201d In a Jan 23 note, HwangDBS Vickers Research attributes the premium of O&G stocks over others to their growth potential, backed by Petronas\\u2019 committed capex for the next few years and the clear earnings visibility of O&G companies that is buttressed by their record-high order books. As at Jan 23, Petronas had spent only RM76 billion of its RM300 billion budget for O&G jobs until 2015. In 2012, it spent RM45.6 billion, nearly 43% of which was channelled into the upstream sector. \\u201cContrary to market perception that Petronas\\u2019 spending has slowed, we believe the state-owned giant has never been busier, dishing out contracts to the industry. It awarded a slew of mega contracts in 2013, particularly the RM10 billion Pan Malaysia hook-up and commissioning job and the RM10 billion Pan Malaysia transport and installation job,\\u201d says HwangDBS. In the meantime, the upside potential of some O&G counters that have risen substantially has already been priced into them. For example, the shares of UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd (UMW-OG), which was listed just three months ago, rose 48.6% from the initial public offering price of RM2.80 to close at RM4.16 last Thursday.  According to Alliance Research, UMW-OG is the only O&G outfit under its coverage with a \\u201csell\\u201d recommendation. It says the stock\\u2019s valuation is much higher than that of big caps like SapuraKencana and Bumi Armada Bhd. \\u201cFurthermore, SapuraKencana and Bumi Armada have better earnings visibility and sizeable order books of RM28 billion and RM10.8 billion respectively, comprising long-term contracts of up to 10 years. On the other hand, UMW-OG has only secured long-term charters for two of its four drilling rigs and its order book is estimated at RM1.5 billion.\\u201d SapuraKencana continues to be the favourite of analysts. Apart from Alliance\\u2019s \\u201cstrong buy\\u201d recommendation, Bloomberg shows another 19 with a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the company and average 12-month target price of RM5.38, which implies an upside potential of 20.09%. The stock closed at RM4.48 last Thursday. Only Deleum Bhd had a higher implied upside potential \\u2014 20.47% \\u2014 among the local O&G stocks. Nevertheless, few analysts cover the O&G small cap. Eastspring\\u2019s Tan, meanwhile, believes the wide gap between SapuraKencana\\u2019s share price and analysts\\u2019 target price is due to the recent capital outflow from emerging markets, including Malaysia. \\u201cLocal funds supported the market strongly last month. But support is not as strong this month. Local funds have already crowded into O&G stocks and foreigners don\\u2019t seem ready to invest in the local market at this point,\\u201d she says.

In a filing with Bursa Malaysia yesterday, the offshore construction and marine service provider said the rise in net profit was due to deferred tax and lower minority interest. The dip in revenue from RM857 million in the previous quarter to RM726.31 million in 4Q13 was due to lower contribution from its marine segment, which saw a sharp decline in revenue from RM172.5 million in 4Q12 to RM90.3 million in 4Q13. For the full year, MHB recorded a net profit of RM236.47 million, a decline of 2.3% from RM242 million in FY12. Revenue fell 15.4% to RM2.9 billion from RM3.3 billion in the previous year. The company proposed a final single-tier dividend of five sen per share for FY13 (FY12: 10 sen). On a segmental basis, the offshore business saw a full year profit of RM104.9 million, down 31.7% from RM483.8 million made in the previous year, owing to higher than expected cost to complete ongoing projects. The marine business division generated a full year profit of RM70.4 million, down 12.9% from RM80.8 million in FY12. This is attributed to a lower revenue of RM372 million, against RM483.8 million in FY12. During the year, MHB successfully sailed away/completed six structures for its clients, including the OSX-3 FPSO external turret, Telok-B topside and Telok-B jacket, and the Gumusut-Kakap floating production system (FPS).

For the full year of 2013, total profits came to RM811.75 million, compared to RM836.84 million in 2012 while revenue totalled RM32.34 billion, up from RM29.51 billion.

The group\\u2019s market cap stood at RM9.06 billion on Jan 22 thanks to the gains in its share price, which closed at RM4.19 on the same day. This represents a staggering 49% increase from its initial public offering (IPO) issue price of RM2.80 per share, which implied a total capitalisation of RM6.05 billion. According to UMW-OG president Rohaizad Darus, the incoming deliveries of new jack-up (JU) drilling rigs will boost the group\\u2019s earnings substantially over the next two years. Drilling services contributed 94% to its total revenue for the first nine months of last year (9M2013). \\u201cIt\\u2019s simple mathematics. Our four operational rigs currently generate a certain amount of revenue. If we add another one, our bottom line will increase by 25%,\\u201d he says during a media briefing last Thursday. Rohaizad was referring to Naga 5, the group\\u2019s latest premium JU rig, which is scheduled for delivery in May. UMW-OG has already secured a US$7 million contract from Nido Petroleum Philippines Pty Ltd for the provision of drilling services by the new rig. Apart from its JU fleet, the group is also the sole Malaysian operator of hydraulic workover units (HWUs), with four currently being deployed in three countries on short- and long-term tenures. Coupled with a RM1 billion war chest from its IPO proceeds after deducting last year\\u2019s expenses, Rohaizad is confident that the group can leverage on its working relationship with Petroliam Nasional Bhd and other oil majors to secure new contracts for its JU rigs and HWUs. \\u201cWe believe we are able to finance a significant number of new rigs and also secure new contracts due to the increasing regional demand.\\u201d Despite its recent share price gains, there are contrasting valuations on the company by research houses. According to Bloomberg data, the consensus analyst view is mostly bearish with 9 out of 13 research houses issuing a \\u201cneutral\\u201d or \\u201csell\\u201d rating on UMW-OG. The most bullish are Maybank IB Research and CIMB Research, which set a target price of RM4.80 and RM4.63 respectively. At the other end of the spectrum is Goldman Sachs Research, which set a fair value of a mere RM2.70 on the oil and gas operator. In a Jan 20 note, Maybank IB argues that the delivery of another two JU rigs \\u2014 Naga 6 and Naga 7 \\u2014 by 2015 warrants a premium valuation on the stock. At RM4.80 per share, the research firm has pegged UMW-OG\\u2019s shares at 23 times projected earnings for FY2015. In its calculations, Maybank IB projected that UMW-OG\\u2019s core net profit and core earnings per share will triple within two years after taking into account the additional revenue boost from the three upcoming JU rigs. \\u201cThe market now demands new, premium JUs, favoured for their superior security, cost and operating features. More importantly, UMW-OG has the balance sheet strength to expand its JU fleet size beyond the projected five units,\\u201d it says. However, it is worth noting that new contracts are the lifeblood of oil and gas companies. UMW-OG\\u2019s contract backlog stands at RM1.45 billion, a small figure compared with the order books of other big caps such as SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd (RM28 billion) and Bumi Armada Bhd (RM10.8 billion), says Alliance Research, which has a \\u201csell\\u201d call on the stock, pegging the fair value at RM3.16. The research outfit says UMW-OG\\u2019s valuation has exceeded its peers, whose shares are currently trading at lower price-earnings multiples. \\u201cWhile the growth outlook for UMW-OG is promising, especially if the group adds on new rigs, we view that valuations have run too far ahead of peers at this juncture,\\u201d it says. At the moment, a huge chunk of UMW-OG\\u2019s revenue comes from contracts awarded by Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd (PCSB), with three out of four rigs deployed for the upstream player\\u2019s needs. Apart from PCSB, UMW-OG\\u2019s client base for the JU rigs consists of HESS, Japan Vietnam Petroleum Co and Nido Petroleum. Underlining its regional expansion plans, Rohaizad says the group is working towards achieving a 50-50 revenue contribution from domestic and overseas operations respectively. For 9M2013, 66% of its revenue came from Malaysia. \\u201cNaga 3 will be moved to Vietnam while Naga 5 will be operating in the Philippines, where we have never been to before. We also have a presence in China, Thailand, Indonesia and Turkmenistan in various capacities.\\u201d The bullish outlook is mainly supported by the upcoming expiration of a whopping 41 JU rig contracts in Southeast Asia this year. In Malaysia, there are currently 18 JUs, of which 16 are foreign owned. In line with the growing demand, daily charter rates for JUs have accordingly risen over the past four years. According to Maybank IB, average day rates are now holding steadily at US$150,000 and should rise to between US$160,000 and US$170,000 levels due to the favourable oil price environment as well as a mismatch between demand and supply. However, it is apparent that the group will have to aggressively expand its operations and secure new contracts on a consistent basis, either one of which is no small task. The drilling services industry also remains highly competitive, and there is no shortage of international oil and gas operators bidding for the same projects that UMW-OG is gunning for. UMW-OG will be spending its cash pile on two new rigs \\u2014 Naga 6 and Naga 7. Will Petronas, which is the company\\u2019s major client, also deploy the new jack-up rigs? That will determine whether the bullishness on the stock is justifiable.

According to executives familiar with the matter, Petronas issued the invitation to bid (ITB) last December and requires ships big enough to operate in and pull rigs in deep waters. SILK, through its subsidiary Jasa Merin (M) Sdn Bhd, owns 21 ships, of which three were ordered in March last year. Two of them have been delivered. Of these three anchor handling tug supply (AHTS) vessels, one is 70m with a bollard pull of 120 tonnes while the other two are 62m with a bollard pull of 60 tonnes. The latter have 5,220 brake horsepower (bhp) and the former 10,800 bhp. Bollard pull measures the maximum pulling force of a vessel. The three AHTS vessels were built by Muhibbah Marine Engineering (M) Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd. According to a source, Jasa Merin recently ordered another three AHTS vessels that meet Petronas\\u2019 specifications. \\u201cIt looks like they [Jasa Merin] have ordered the right ships for the upcoming tender. SILK is well positioned because since last year \\u2014 when all the other OSV players were ordering small ships \\u2014 it has been ordering large vessels. \\u201cThe new ones [that have been ordered] have a bollard pull of about 140 tonnes and are big enough to operate in deep waters.\\u201d While other OSV operators like Perdana Petroleum Bhd, Icon Offshore Bhd and Alam Maritim Resources Bhd may also participate in the tender, industry analysts note that these companies may not be as well equipped as SILK. \\u201cThis time [when the ITB was issued], Alam Maritim and Perdana Petroleum lacked the ships needed,\\u201d an analyst with a bank-backed research house tells The Edge. The analyst estimates that Petronas will require 20 OSVs for its upcoming tender. \\u201cPerdana Petroleum has five with a capacity of more than 100 tonnes of bollard pull, but four of these AHTS vessels have already been chartered out. Alam Maritim has only two ships with similar specifications. As for Icon, it only has small ships.\\u201d As Jasa Merin will probably not be able to fulfil Petronas\\u2019 demand for 20 vessels, the national oil company will likely source for ships in Singapore, the analyst notes. Should Jasa Merin clinch the OSV contract, it will most likely be a catalyst for SILK, which depends on its oil and gas division to boost its earnings. In 1QFY2014 ended Oct 31, the group recorded a 22.6% drop in net profit to RM2.18 million from RM2.82 million the year before on revenue of RM94.45 million. In FY2013 ended July 31, SILK reported a net profit of RM4.41 million on revenue of RM383.35 million compared with a loss of RM679,000 in FY2012. In its 2012 annual report, SILK noted that its oil and gas support services division continued to be the main contributor to its top line, accounting for 80% of the group\\u2019s total revenue. The deployment of additional vessels last year, coupled with improved charter rates, also allowed SILK\\u2019s oil and gas segment to record a pre-tax profit of RM41.7 million compared with RM37.5 million previously. In FY2013, Jasa Merin announced seven new contracts for its vessels and two extensions of previous contracts. It also deployed a total of 23 vessels to various clients compared with 22 the year before. Moving forward, the group expects its 37km Kajang SILK Highway to continue to record accounting losses as the existing high financing and amortisation costs weigh it down. Nevertheless, an increase in traffic volume and the paring down of its borrowing costs will ensure its losses decline. The group\\u2019s highway division is expected to remain cash flow positive as a result of the restructuring of long-term debt undertaken in 2008. As part of the restructuring, SILK ventured into oil and gas support services with the acquisition of AQL Aman Sdn Bhd, the holding company of Jasa Merin.

Recall that Perisai had placed an order with SembCorp Marine (SMM) to acquire a high-spec jack-up rig (high temperature, high pressure) for US$208 million (RM678 million), to be delivered by July 2014. While Perisai is close to securing its first jack-up rig contract, channel checks suggest that the charter rates could be much lower than our original forecast charter rate of US$190,000 per day as the contract may be longer in tenure. We estimate that the rig contract will lift 2014 earnings by RM19 million (assuming a charter rate of US$150,000 per day). On Dec 31, 2013, Perisai had announced that it had ordered its third jack-up drilling rig from PPL Shipyard, Singapore for US$211.5 million. Perisai will pay a 10% deposit to PPL Shipyard in the first quarter (1Q) of 2014 and will need to pay another 10% by end-2014 while the remaining 80% will be paid upon delivery. Compared with its first two jack-up rigs, Perisai is paying an additional US$3.5 million for its third jack-up rig. We understand that jack-up rig builders are well booked for the next two years, so there is a chance for more price hikes as global demand for the asset remains strong. Hence, the purchase is timely to leverage on Petroliam Nasional Bhd\\u2019s (Petronas) asset localisation policy. We are encouraged by the charter commencement of Perisai\\u2019s floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel after a delay since late-July. It marks the company\\u2019s entry into the FPSO segment and its transformation from a bareboat charterer to an operator. Early contributions from the vessel will be reflected in its results for the fourth quarter of financial year 2013 ended Dec 31 (4QFY13), reducing the earnings vacuum caused by two idle assets, namely its mobile offshore production unit (MOPU) and derrick pipelay barge. Channel checks suggest that Perisai is currently vying for at least two potential contracts for its MOPU. We understand that on the domestic front, Perisai is tying up with Talisman Energy Inc to charter out its MOPU if Talisman secures a production sharing contract (PSC) in the PM9 oilfield, off peninsular Malaysia. Industry publication Upstream online recently reported that Perisai is tying up with PetroVietnam Drilling to supply its MOPU to Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd\\u2019s marginal oilfields in Vietnam called Ham Rong and Gau Chua-Ca Cao. While we are hopeful on both prospects, we gather that progress has been slow as the MOPU was previously designed for a gas field, hence it is a bit more challenging to charter it out. We do not discount the possibility of an equity fund raising exercise in 2014 given the strength of Perisai\\u2019s share price. Recall that the company will need to fork out some RM500 million this year to pay for its first jack-up rig, to be delivered towards the end of the second quarter of 2014 (2Q14), and an additional RM500 million for its second jack-up rig in 2015. For now, we assume that the company will raise the funds via debt in our earnings forecast. We anticipate weaker sequential earnings in 4QFY13 due to the lack of charter income for its MOPU and derrick pipelay barge, although the weakness will be partially offset by maiden contributions from its new FPSO vessel (Perisai Kamelia) and its offshore support vessels. For our earnings forecast for 2014, we are taking a conservative approach with our forecasts and impute merely six months\\u2019 contribution (previously nine months) from its MOPU and derrick pipelay barge, leaving some room for upgrades later if it secures a charter before end-2Q14. We are also including six months\\u2019 earnings contribution from its jack-up rig (assuming a charter rate of US$150,000 per day). For 2015, we assume full-year earnings contributions from its offshore support vessels, FPSO, MOPU, derrick pipelay barge and first jack-up rig. We estimate that Perisai\\u2019s second jack-up rig could enhance our earnings forecast by RM19 million (assuming a charter rate of US$150,000 per day) if it is able to secure the contract by the end of this year. This will prompt further rerating for the stock in our view. We reiterate our \\u201cbuy\\u201d recommendation on Perisai with a higher target price of RM2.18 as we roll over our valuations to 2015 coupled with an earnings revision. Our target price is premised on 14 times 2015F price-earnings ratio and includes the option of securing a second rig contract. We advocate investors to accumulate the shares if it weakens as the current share price has probably factored in the charter of its first jack-up rig. We still believe that there is upside if Perisai is able to realise its full earnings potential. An ideal accumulation level will be in the range of RM1.40 to RM1.50. \\u2014 UOB KayHian Research, Jan 13 This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on January 15, 2014."}, "129": {"date_posted": "13/1/2014", "title": "Noon market: KLCI up 0.5% in anticipation of prolonged QE", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 13): The FBM KLCI erased losses for an 8.93-point or 0.5% gain possibly in anticipation that a weaker US jobs report may prolong the world's-largest economy's quantitative easing (QE) measures.

She also predicts that O&G, property, water, shipping and banking sectors will do well in the new lunar year, which starts on Jan 31 (Chinese New Year). But the worst performing sectors under her feng shui reading are wood-based sectors, including timber and plantations. These predictions of Lilian Too, one of the most influential bankers in the 1980s when she served the Hong Leong Group in Malaysia and Hong Kong, were made at CIMB\\u2019s Corporation Day yesterday. In a note today, CIMB Research said there are many similarities between Too\\u2019s predictions.

The worst performing sectors are timber and plantations,\\u201d the note said. CIMB Research noted that its KLCI target of 2030 points in 2014 is one of the highest, if not, the highest among securities analysts. While CIMB is bullish on construction and real estate, as well as oil and gas sectors, it is neutral on the plantation sector. \\u201cThe only sectors where the views diverge are perhaps timber, which is wood-based\\u2026 We believe that timber companies will benefit from higher log production and rising plywood prices,\\u201d said CIMB. CIMB said it also likes selective smaller cap stocks due to their attractive valuations. The research house advises investors to stick with the ETP beneficiaries this year as they will continue to gain from positive newsflow during the year. \\u201cOur top-3 picks are SapuraKencana for oil & gas, Gamuda for construction and Mah Sing for property.
