Its takaful business \\u2014 under Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Bhd \\u2013 saw a 10% rise in revenue to RM1.52 billion from RM1.39 billion in the previous year, due to higher sales by both family and general takaful businesses. KPJ Healthcare Bhd's net profit dropped by 15% in its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2016 (3QFY16) to RM32.5 million from RM38.16 million a year ago due to higher depreciation and finance costs from newly opened hospitals. Revenue, however, was up 6% at RM767.04 million from RM721.84 million, its Bursa Malaysia filing today showed. KPJ also declared an interim dividend of 1.5 sen for FY16, payable on Jan 11, which would bring its cumulative payout year-to-date to 5.05 sen compared with 6.1 sen last year.

Its revenue also grew 22.46% to RM313.29 million in 3QFY16 from RM255.84 million a year ago, on higher sales volume and improved gross profit margin due to price adjustments for foreign currency fluctuation by original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers.

According to Bursa, MyEG had at a CIMB conference on Jan 6, 2015, disclosed the government's decision for MyEG to implement the fully online renewal of foreign workers' permit from 2015 onwards, while the announcement on the matter was only made to the stock exchange on Jan 9 and 12, 2015. It added that the disclosure made to Bursa also excluded the details of the deal's impact and implication on MyEG's financials, which was disclosed in MyEG's presentation to fund managers at the CIMB conference. Karyon Industries Bhd said a fire incident had occurred at a third party premises located adjacent to one of the manufacturing facilities of its wholly-owned subsidiary Hsing Lung Sdn Bhd (HLSB) at Taman Perindustrian Sri Plentong, Johor. In a filing with the exchange today, it said the incident on Sunday affected a small area of HLSB's factory, resulting in damage to its raw materials and finished products and the disruption of two PVC production lines. The group said it is unable to finalise the financial impact to Karyon and its subsidiaries, but said the damage is adequately insured pending the insurance company's assessment. Media Chinese International Ltd's net profit fell 32% in its second quarter of the financial year 2017 (FY17) on softer advertising spending amid weak consumer sentiments, which affected all its business segments. Its net profit came in at RM21.3 million for the quarter ended Sept 30, 2016 (2QFY17) from RM31.5 million a year ago. Revenue was down 12% at RM353.4 million from RM402.4 million, its bourse filing today showed. It is paying a first interim dividend of 0.36 US cents per share or 1.45 sen per share, which will go ex on Dec 13, and be payable on Dec 30. For the cumulative first half (1HFY17), its net profit shrank 38% to RM42.1 million from RM68 million a year ago, as revenue slipped 15% to RM695.8 million from RM815.9 million on continued market weakness across all its business segments. It expects the operating environment in 2HFY17 to \"remain difficult and challenging\" with the publishing and printing segment to see more intense competitive pressures, along with declining print advertising expenditures. Weak consumer sentiments as well as safety concerns and cut-throat competition will also continue to affect the group\\u2019s travel business in the quarters ahead, it said. Eversendai Corp Bhd achieved a historic RM2.7 billion order book as at the end of its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2016 (3QFY16). It has secured RM1.8 billion worth of new contracts to date with the possibility of exceeding a RM2 billion threshold before the end of the year, the group said in a statement today. About 39.4% of the order book came from the group's traditional stronghold in the Middle East region, 25.1% from South East Asia, 20.2% from India and the remaining 15.3% is from the oil and gas segment. For 3QFY16, the group's net profit halved to RM7.28 million or 94 sen per share from RM14.58 million or 1.88 a share in 3QFY15 while revenue fell 21% to RM371.36 million from RM471.48 million, the group said in a Bursa Malaysia filing today. Cahya Mata Sarawak Bhd's net profit dropped 11% to RM58.7 million in its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2016 (3QFY16), compared with RM65.5 million last year as revenue fell. Revenue came in 14% lower at RM356.06 million from RM411.84 million a year ago, as the previous year recorded a revenue arrears reinstatement from routine maintenance works. For its cumulative nine months (9MFY16), net profit fell 59% to RM67.7 million from RM163.6 million last year, as revenue slipped 14% to RM1.1 billion versus RM1.28 billion. The substantially weaker earnings, it said, were due to its share of substantial losses in its associates and lower earnings from its cement and construction and road maintenance divisions. However, Cahya Mata Sarawak said the group's core business remains resilient during the period, and it is confident the company would achieve an acceptable performance for the full year, evidenced by strong recovery profits in 3QFY16. It closed down five sen or 1.38% at RM3.57 for a market capitalisation of RM3.8 billion. Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB) recorded a surge in its net profit of over four times to RM29.39 million for 1.49 sen per share in its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2016 (3QFY16) compared with RM5.64 million or 0.32 sen per share in the previous corresponding quarter. Meanwhile, revenue for the quarter was up 47.36% to RM551.22 million, compared with RM374.06 million in the previous corresponding quarter (3QFY15), attributed to the group\\u2019s core operating activities, namely property development and investment, MRCB said in a statement released today. However, the cumulative net profit for the nine months ended Sept 30, 2016 (9MFY16) fell to RM79.28 million, down 73.9% from RM303.6 million from the previous corresponding nine-month period (9MFY15). According to MRCB, this was due to the RM278.5 million gain recorded from disposals of the group\\u2019s non-core assets in 2015. Revenue was up 5% at RM1.376 billion, from RM1.31 billion. UEM Sunrise Bhd reported a 23% decline in its net profit to RM36.33 million or 0.8 sen per share for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2016, from RM47.74 million or 1.05 sen per share in the previous year\\u2019s corresponding quarter. Revenue rose 19% to RM421.25 million from RM353.06 million, it said in a filing today. The higher revenue, it said, was mainly due to revenue contribution from the progress made by its Residensi 22, Serene Heights and Australian projects. Net profit for the cumulative nine months fell 49% to RM94.01 million from RM184.79 million in the previous year. Revenue climbed 7% to RM1.22 billion from RM1.14 billion."}, "1": {"date_posted": "30/6/2016", "title": "Value emerging in Asean (Pt 1)", "article": " This article first appeared in Personal Wealth, The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on June 20 - June 26, 2016. \\u00a0 Against a backdrop of negative yields globally, the region still has plenty of potential for investors. Patrick Chang, chief investment officer at CIMB-Principal Asset Management Bhd, says the region\\u2019s economic growth, as a result of growing affluence and infrastructure spending, coupled with healthy dividend yields, makes it an attractive investment destination. \\u00a0 Asean economies will continue to outperform as they are healthier than those in North Asia such as China. They also offer some of the highest dividend yields in the world, says Patrick Chang, chief investment officer at CIMB-Principal Asset Management Bhd.\\u00a0 \\u201cAsean economies are outperforming not only because of their higher dividend yields but also because they are relatively healthier than the North Asian economies. Although their currencies were bashed down last year when the US dollar strengthened, they are getting stronger now. The emerging markets in Asean such as Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines will provide higher growth and higher earning companies, so this is a good opportunity to invest in the region,\\u201d he tells Personal Wealth on the sidelines of the CIMB Preferred\\u2019s 100th Financial Advisory Series recently. According to Bloomberg data as at June 15, the MSCI Southeast Asia had a dividend yield of 3.11% for the one-year period \\u2014 more than the MSCI Emerging Markets, MSCI AC Asia ex Japan and MSCI World, which had yields of 2.85%, 2.85% and 2.75% respectively. Chang is an Asean markets specialist with 22 years\\u2019 experience. He is bullish on the region as he sees value emerging in these markets. \\u201cIf we look at the return on equity (ROE) versus price-to-book value in Asean over the last 15 years, we can see that the big jump since 2009 had been generated by a few factors, including the huge commodity boom from 2009 to 2011. In May 2013, the ROE began to drop and it is now at 2009 levels,\\u201d he says. \\u201cWe live in a world where Japan and Europe have negative yields, so investors in these countries can no longer keep their money in the bank. They need more returns. The yields in Asean are much higher in the eyes of the Europeans and Japanese, so they will invest in these countries,\\u201d says Chang.\\u00a0 That is the reason CIMB-Principal has added higher-yield companies to its Malaysian and Asean portfolios, he says. Investors can look at real estate investment trusts, utilities and infrastructure-related companies to get higher dividend yields. A Bloomberg article dated May 31 says Japan\\u2019s investments in Asean last year exceeded those in China and Hong Kong for the third year running. Meanwhile, according to Bank of Japan data, its Asean investments had tripled to \\u00a520.1 trillion from five years ago. The higher inflows were attributed to push and pull factors such as Asean\\u2019s low labour costs, low per capita income and relatively young population. Also, tensions reduced China\\u2019s appeal in the eyes of some Japanese businesses, causing them to explore other markets. The European Union is one of Asean\\u2019s largest sources of foreign direct investment (FDI).\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Aspirational buying to boost industries Asean is poised to become an economic powerhouse, making it an attractive region for investors. According to a McKinsey & Co 2014 report, it would be the seventh largest economy in the world if it were a single country, based on its GDP of US$2.4 trillion in 2013. Asean is expected to be the fourth largest economy by 2050, says the report.\\u00a0 Chang likes the long-term consumption trend in Asean. He believes that GDP per capita will continue to rise and wages will increase in middle-income countries. These bode well for some companies, especially for automotive, cosmetic and luxury brands.\\u00a0 \\u201cAspirational buying across Asean is huge. Going forward, this is what middle-class consumption will be like. The beauty of this is that with smartphones, people can spend online easily. It has nothing to do with GDP, interest rates and all the noise you hear in the market. I think this is a very structural story,\\u201d says Chang.\\u00a0 He cites an example of a rising affluent population where people plan to increase their aspirational buying over time. For example, he says, these people would buy Toblerone chocolate once in a while instead of buying their usual low-quality milk chocolate all the time. \\u201cIf you are poor, your aspirational buying will increase. And this is the biggest phenomenon in terms of consumption among the middle class across Asean. About 20 years ago, people used Nokia. But today, in emerging markets such as the Philippines, everyone wants an [Apple] iPhone. They are not earning a lot, but they will save just to buy an iPhone.\\u201d It is the same when it comes to owning a vehicle, he says. When people buy pick-up trucks in the Philippines, their ultimate goal is the Toyota Hilux. That is why Toyota has 40% market share in the country. But eventually, this market share will erode as the country brings in other high-end brands such as Lexus and BMW.\\u00a0 For example, Philippine-based Universal Robina Corp (URC) \\u2014 which produces consumer goods such as flour, sugar, beverages, snacks, biscuits and candy \\u2014 bought into New Zealand\\u2019s largest snack food producer Griffin\\u2019s Foods for US$608 million in mid-2014 to gain access to premium brands.\\u00a0 According to the Nikkei Asian Review, URC also formed a joint venture with Japan-based Calbee Inc in 2014 to launch the latter\\u2019s potato snacks in the Philippines. As at June 14, URC shares were trading at 194.10 peso on the Philippine Stock Exchange.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 High-growth markets Chang says Asean today can be grouped into developing countries, such as Singapore and Thailand, and emerging countries such as Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar. CIMB-Principal Asset Management has structured its Asean portfolio to include overweight high-growth markets such as the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand.\\u00a0 \\u201cThe political risks in the Philippines have subsided, and it has become one of the most underleveraged economies in the region. The country has the largest business process outsourcing (BPO) business in the world. JP Morgan and Wells Fargo have set up BPO centres in Manila and Cebu. The services provided include call centres to accounting and webpage creation. Foreign direct investment will continue to come in as long as the labour cost is relatively cheap compared with China\\u2019s,\\u201d he says. Chang likes Indonesia and is hopeful that its tax amnesty bill will pass. The bill \\u2014 designed to make it attractive for tax evaders to come clean, declare and repatriate their funds \\u2014 will be the biggest driver of consumption and the infrastructure boom as the government\\u2019s coffers grow.\\u00a0 \\u201cWe like Thailand because it is the epicentre of Indochina and will be the major supply chain for the whole region. So, this gives us exposure to the supply chain for many sectors,\\u201d says Chang, adding in jest that the country is also his favourite holiday destination.\\u00a0 According to Bloomberg data as at June 14, while the Philippine Stock Exchange\\u2019s PSEi Index was offering a year-to-date return of 6.88% and the Jakarta Composite Index had delivered a year-to-date return of 4.79%, the Thailand SET 50 Index had provided a year-to-date return of 11.44%.\\u00a0 In the first four months of this year, Asean outperformed the rest of Asia and the developed markets, says Chang. He points out that normally emerging markets do well when the US dollar is weak.\\u00a0 \\u201cThe outperformance of the Asean market was caused by a few things. First, the US dollar found a little of its bottom; it is coming off a very high base.\\u201d\\u00a0 The prices of commodities such as oil have also rebounded, which is good news for Asean as many of them, such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, are commodity exporters. Chang thinks the markets are in the process of adjustment and need recalibration in terms of things like interest rate expectation.\\u00a0 \\u201cOverall, Asia is in a very low growth environment. The slowing down of China \\u2014 the biggest market in Asia \\u2014 impacts Asean, especially when most of us are suffering from the commodity boom-bust cycle, although prices have started to stabilise,\\u201d he says.

In a statement today, Zafrul said while he agreed with Fitch Ratings\\u2019 view that there was pressure on banks\\u2019 asset quality, which could make impaired loan ratios to rise, there were various factors that would help to prevent the uptick from being significant. Zafrul listed those factors as being: a \"still-healthy\\u201d projected gross domestic product growth of 4.7% in 2015 and 4.6% in 2016, a forecast unemployment rate of 3.3% for the two years, Bank Negara Malaysia\\u2019s responsible lending guideline and tighter lending criteria for mortgages, and a declining corporate gearing ratio. He said the corporate sector\\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio was expected to come to 3% in 2016, compared with 50% in 2005 and 12% in 2015. \\u201c(This signified) the lower risk of default in the corporate loan segment,\\u201d he added. \\u201cDespite the slowdown in China's economic growth impacting Malaysia's economic growth and banking sector, we believe that this has been factored into our projected GDP growth of 4.6% to 4.7% in 2015 and 2016,\\u201d said Zafrul. This however, does not mean a rosy picture ahead. Zafrul expects the operating conditions in Malaysia to continue to be tough in the first half of 2016, as consumer spending is hampered by the continuing weakness in ringgit, higher cost of living, rising unemployment and tighter credit. \\u00a0 \\u201cNonetheless, fixed investment is expected to pick up as the new 5-year plan kicks off and it would help to offset some of the lost momentum in consumer spending, to ensure sustained strength in domestic demand,\\u201d he said. On its part, CIMB, the country\\u2019s second-largest bank, is projecting its net profit to grow by 11.2% for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2016 (FY16) \\u2014 \\u201con the back of our forecast of a 6.9% rise in net interest income and a 9.5% increase in non-interest income\\u201d. For illustrative purposes, CIMB\\u2019s net profit for 9MFY15 fell by 30.37% to RM2.02 billion, from RM2.91 billion a year ago. Bloomberg data showed analysts forecasting CIMB\\u2019s full FY15 net profit to be RM3.27 billion, against FY14\\u2019s RM3.11 billion. Moving on to corporate deals, Zafrul said in 2016, investment deals could be supported by private sector outlays in the manufacturing and services sectors, as well as public infrastructure-related spending. \\u201cWe are optimistic on the Malaysian bond markets in 2016. The year will potentially surpass 2015 in terms of sukuk sales, as we are projecting RM70 billion to RM75 billion of corporate bonds issuances for FY2016, out of which sukuk historically makes up about 70-80% of the annual issuances,\\u201d he noted. He also sees several infrastructure projects comprising roads and railways, valued at the least between RM75 billion and RM80 billion that were deferred in 2015, to likely be launched in 2016, as the government attempts to sustain economic growth. \\u201cDue to the US Federal Reserve rate hike, we expect renewed interest in IPOs and raising of capital in Malaysia, particularly for export-oriented companies that would benefit from a stronger US dollar,\\u201d he said of the IPO market. \\u201cWe also expect more activities on the merger and acquisition front, particularly in the insurance, electronics, property and telco industries, as companies look to consolidate or strengthen their market positions, said Zafrul.

The company was represented by its corporate finance director, Danny Ng, and acting president of Puncak Niaga Oil & Gas (POG), Datuk Hashim Mahfar. We wanted to zero in on the group\\u2019s plans post-Selangor water deal and find out how the RM1.6 billion cash hoard will be utilised. Earlier this month, the Selangor government announced that water concessionaire holder Puncak Niaga had agreed in principle to the state\\u2019s offer to take over its assets and operations in the state.The RM1.6 billion cash deal is practically fixed (pending finalisation of accounts and due diligence) and does not include any valuation top-up. The carrot was that Puncak Niaga retains its non-water concession-related assets in the construction, water and sewerage infrastructure segments, which we roughly estimate to be worth 10% to 15% of Puncak Niaga (M) Sdn Bhd\\u2019s (PNSB) book value (BV), and property assets worth around RM250 m illion to RM300 million. The state government is now only interested in acquiring the group\\u2019s water treatment and distribution businesses, that is the 100%-owned PNSB and 70%-owned Syarikat Bekalan Air Selangor Sdn Bhd (Syabas). The deal should be completed by year-end. Management believes that there are no reasons to delay the restructuring of Selangor\\u2019s water industry as the offer price is not likely to be revised. We also believe that the overall RM1.6 billion price tag offers sufficient compensation for the negative BV of 70%-owned Syabas. We believe that the RM1.6 billion incoming cash (likely in the first quarter of 2015) would be timely and sufficient to fund the group\\u2019s oil and gas capital expenditure/acquisitions over the next 12 to 18 months. We also do not rule out the possibility of Puncak Niaga paying out special dividends. Management is exploring the possibility of a bumper dividend payout in 2014/15. We estimate that if Puncak Niaga sets aside a mere 8% to 10% of the RM1.6 billion cash proceeds for special dividends, it will translate into a special dividend of 25 sen to 30 sen per share and potential dividend yield of 7% to 8%. Puncak Niaga\\u2019s last bumper dividend payout was a capital repayment of around 60 sen per share in 2006. Puncak Niaga\\u2019s share price has risen by 20% since our upgrade on June 11, 2014. At full value (that is, zero discount to sum-of-parts [SOP]), Puncak Niaga is worth RM5.35 per share (fully diluted for warrants and convertible bonds). Our SOP includes the oil and gas segment, valued at an arguably conservative target calendar year 2015 price-earnings ratio of 16 times. Hypothetically, if we were to cut our SOP discount from 20% to 10% in view of the improved sentiment on the stock, our target price will rise to RM4.82, which presents an attractive 28% upside from the current level. Maintain \\u201cadd\\u201d with unchanged target price of RM4.28. We understand that the negotiations between Puncak Niaga and the the federal and Selangor governments will run its own course, regardless of the progress of the takeover talks for Gamuda Bhd\\u2019s 45%-owned Syarikat Pengeluar Air Selangor Holdings Bhd (the Selangor government\\u2019s last water asset target). Puncak Niaga\\u2019s water negotiations should reach critical milestones in the second half of this year. We think that there are minimal execution and delay risks for Puncak Niaga\\u2019s exit from the water concession business for good. Instead, we anticipate that investors will develop greater appreciation for the POG growth story post-water restructuring. \\u2014 CIMB Research, June 23 This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on June 24, 2014."}, "15": {"date_posted": "20/6/2014", "title": "Hot Stock: SapuraKencana rises 3% on 1Q profit, dividends", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (June 20): SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd rose as much as 3% after the company said first quarter net profit soared 443.6% from a year earlier.

With YTL Power pulling out, the Energy Commission is likely to call for an open tender for Project 4A, albeit on an accelerated basis due to the urgent need for the plant. We expect the Project 4A open tender to be completed in three to six months. We are confident that YTL Power is capable of winning Project 4A in the competitive bidding process, given that: (i) it was the lowest bidder for the previous power plant, Project 3B, which was won by 1Malaysia Development Bhd; (ii) its 1BestariNet 4G education project award was similar to Project 4A in that the initial directly-negotiated contract with the government was cancelled but YTL Power subsequently emerged as the winner of the open tender beating 19 other contenders; and (iii) it has done well in competitive bids worldwide as demonstrated by Wessex Water in the UK and Power Seraya in Singapore.

The index\\u2019s price movements in the next few months following May 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69 (high), 1,802.88 (low) and 1,889.47 (high). The index\\u2019s daily signals are positive, as the CCI, DMI, MACD Oscillator and Stochastic have issued \\u201cbuy\\u201d readings. As such, the index\\u2019s obvious support levels are seen at 1,845, 1,860 and 1,881, while the resistance level of 1,883 and all-time high of 1,889 will offer some liquidation and profit-taking. Its simple moving averages depict a marginal uptrend for its daily, weekly and monthly charts. Despite its upbeat chart signals, we believe investors will adopt a \\u201crange trading\\u201d tone for the KLCI. With the very obvious bearish divergence signals on its indicators, currently the chance for a significant upside for the index is greatly diminished. For now, the index will remain rangebound between 1,860 and 1,889. Despite the mixed tone for the KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201cbuy\\u201d on MNRB Holdings Bhd. On Tuesday, MNRB\\u2019s stock closed at a new 52-week high of RM4.90. For financial year 2014 ended March 31 (FY14), the group\\u2019s revenue and profit before tax improved by about 3% and 38% year-on-year respectively. The improvement in profit was attributed to an increase in gross premiums and contribution by the company\\u2019s re-insurance and takaful subsidiaries respectively. MNRB has four core segments, namely investment holding, reinsurance business, takaful business and retakaful business. All business segments reported improved bottom line growth. A check of Bloomberg consensus revealed that no research houses have coverage on MNRB. The stock is currently trading at a very attractive historical price-earnings ratio of 6.63 times and its price-to-book value ratio of 0.89 times indicates that it is still trading at a discount to its book value. MNRB\\u2019s 12-month dividend yield is at a very high of 6.6%. Looking at the reported shareholding changes on Bloomberg, no major acquisition and disposal of shares were reported recently. MNRB\\u2019s chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is up. Its share price has made an obvious surge since its daily Wave-2 low of RM3.75 on May 27, 2014. Since that RM3.75 low, MNRB surged to its recent June 2014 high of RM4.90. MNRB\\u2018s chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to its recent June 2014 high of RM4.90. As it broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of RM4.37 and RM4.70, look to \\u201cbuy\\u201d MNRB on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term uptrends for this stock. The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD and Oscillator) are very strong and now depict the firm indications of MNRB\\u2019s eventual move towards much higher levels. It would attract very firm buying at the support levels of RM4.37, RM4.70 and RM4.83. We expect MNRB to attract minor profit-taking towards its resistance levels of RM4.90, RM5.10 and RM5.80. Its upside targets are located at RM4.98, RM5.33 and RM5.77.

Foreign portfolio managers remained aggregate net buyers of stocks in seven Asian exchanges used by MIDF Research to track fund flow, pumping in a total of US$1 billion (RM3.2 billion) last week. The amount was unchanged from the previous week, which reflected moderate risk appetite.\\u00a0In broader Asian markets, foreign interest appears to be waning. However, Thailand found renewed favour with global investors who snapped up US$246 million worth of stocks, the highest weekly amount recorded this year. The military junta has stepped up its efforts to promote pro-growth measures, indicating that a return to economic normalcy is imminent, said MIDF Research. The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index was up by 3% last week, the second best weekly performance this year. Malaysia\\u2019s fund flow was consistent with the lower broader trends, with only RM20 million worth of Bursa Malaysia-listed stocks purchased by foreign buyers. Average daily participation on Bursa fell from RM2.1 billion in the week before to only RM1.1 billion last week. For 2014, foreign investors remained net sellers of Malaysian stocks on a cumulative basis, but the net outflow as at last Friday was seen to be slowing down. For the week ended June 6, local stocks which received the highest net inflow included CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, YTL Corp Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd, while stocks which saw the highest net outflow included Telekom Malaysia Bhd, Alliance Financial Group Bhd and YTL Power International Bhd. The FBM KLCI gained a marginal 0.1% for the month of May, while the FBM70 lost a slight 0.2%. \\u201cAlthough lacklustre, it was rather unsurprising as May tends to be volatile and prices are more likely to be weighed down by the negatives,\\u201d said MIDF Research.

Local institutions also recorded its lowest participation this year, with average daily volume of only RM1.8billion. Local funds bought only RM75 million in the preceding week. Nevertheless, MIDF Research expects Malaysia\\u2019s improving economic fundamentals to keep the ringgit buoyant.

Meanwhile, on the property market outlook, most of the CIMB staff polled were planning to buy properties in the next three years while still expecting prices to rise strongly, despite the slew of cooling measures introduced by the government. In a strategy report published yesterday, titled \\u201cMalaysian lifestyle and habits\\u201d, CIMB said it received over 3,000 replies or a 40% response rate from the 8,000 staff to whom it had emailed the questionnaires.  Women made up 61% of the respondents and men, 39%. By race, Malays made up 48% of the respondents, Chinese 39% and Indians nearly 9%. Some 36.43% of the respondents have monthly household incomes of RM5,001 to RM10,000, while those earning above that bracket made up 30% and those below RM5,000 per month made up 33.57% of the respondents. On stock market investments, the report said a surprisingly high number of respondents (30%) were looking to take profit on their existing positions and only 12% wanted to put more into the market.  \\u201cThis could reflect the perceptions by many that the KLCI is trading near its all-time highs and therefore the upside could be limited,\\u201d it added.  \\u201cBut should we include the 20% that said they will hold on to their positions with those that want to put more money in, an all-in 33% expect the market to rise further. This means the bears and the bulls are nearly equally balanced, with the bulls having a slight edge,\\u201d the report noted.  According to CIMB, over 60% of the respondents did invest in the market, a percentage that is not small by any measure. On property purchases, CIMB said 11% of the respondents planned to make a property purchase within the next 12 months while 58% planned to buy something within the next three years. Fifteen percent had no intention to buy anything anytime. \\u201cFifty-four percent cited affordability and financing as the key deterrent in making a purchase, with another 28% citing the property price outlook as the deterrent.

It observed that as liquidity remained flushed in the system, there was strong buying support by domestic institutional funds. \\u201cWith dissipating concerns over QE tapering and brighter economic prospect for Malaysia\\u2026foreign equity flows have turned positive again over the past two months (April: +RM0.7 billion, May: +RM3.1 billion),\\u201d said the research house. \\u201cThis is likely to provide further support to Malaysian equities going forward,\\u201d added AllianceDBS. However, there are still risks ahead. The key risk for Malaysian equities is corporate earnings disappointment amid rising inflationary pressure, declining consumer sentiment, and slow household income growth. The research house noted that although results in the first quarter of 2014 were mostly in line, negative earnings surprises outweighed positives by 3 to 1, weighed down by glove (temporary production disruptions), and oil & gas (execution issues) sectors. Due to this, AllianceDBS has adjusted FBMKLCI earnings for CY14 and CY15 by +1.6% and -0.2%, respectively, leading to growth moderating from 9.7% to 7.8% for CY15 \\u201cdue to higher base in CY14\\u201d. On stock recommendations, the research house says it favours growth stocks with strong execution track record, stocks with M&A (mergers and acquisitions) and restructuring themes. \\u201cOil & gas and construction remain the favoured sectors for growth theme,\\u201d it said. On oil & gas and construction sectors, the research house advised investors to be more selective as valuation was no longer cheap though growth prospects remained promising given sizeable secured orderbooks and positive newsflows ahead. Within oil & gas sector, SapuraKencana and Dayang Enterprise were given special mention in the report. For construction, the research house\\u2019s picks are IJM Corporation Bhd, Gamuda Bhd and MMC Corporation Bhd. \\u201cWe have neutral views on other sectors except for property, which remains as underweight given expectation of slowing property sales amid government\\u2019s cooling measures,\\u201d it said. In the research report, aviation sector has been upgraded from underweight to neutral as previous concerns on a delay in the opening of klia2 was unfounded, with the new airport terminal opening as scheduled on 2 May with limited hiccups. \\u201cWe expect low cost carriers\\u2019 yield to improve in the 2H driven by stronger pricing power following its move to klia2. The potential restructuring of MAS could also alleviate pressure on yield as we expect capacity rationalisation to be part of the exercise.\\u201d Consumer sector has been upgraded from underweight to neutral as current valuations have largely priced-in weak consumer sentiment and inflationary pressure. Although glove sector has been downgraded from overweight to neutral due to stiffer competition and slower expansion plan in the first quarter, the research house says it is optimistic that the glove sector will deliver decent earnings growth (high single digit if not low teens) in 2014, underpinned by lower latex cost, weaker ringgit against US dollar and disciplined capacity expansion by market leaders. Seeing that banks will benefit from an imminent interest rate uptick expected in July, AllianceDBS said banks with higher variable rate loans (except for AMMB) and strong current accounts/savings accounts or CASA base (Maybank, CIMB, Public Bank and HLB) should benefit if interest rate is raised, \\u201cWe like Public Bank for its defensive and consistent deliverables\\u2026.

For M&A and structural change play, the research house favours Bursa Malaysia, which it says will benefit from a revamp in fee and cost structure.

IJM Corp\\u2019s share price rose 25 sen or 3.79% to close at RM6.85, and was among the top five stock gainers on Bursa Malaysia with 6.55 million shares done. Silk\\u2019s stock, meanwhile, ended the day up six sen or 7.06% at 91 sen. It was the third most active stock yesterday, with 47.13 million shares changing hands.  IJM Corp\\u2019s move to acquire Silk Highway via its wholly-owned subsidiary, Road Builder (M) Holdings Bhd, is seen by analysts as a positive one. CIMB Research analyst Sharizan Rosely said the deal is seen as \\u201canother positive surprise\\u201d for IJM Corp and raised expectations that plans to list its enlarged key concession assets are back on track. Based on Silk\\u2019s previous five years\\u2019 accounts, he said, the price tag is equivalent to a price-to-book value of 1.8 times and enterprise value/earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EV/Ebitda) of 22 times, which he deemed as fair. The key draw factor, said Sharizan, is Silk\\u2019s fast-growing traffic volume due to the population factor in Kajang with 209,000 average daily traffic volume (ADTV) from 109,000 ADTV in 2013. \\u201cThis makes the acquisition a [timely] one as Silk is likely to break even by next year as the bumper 40% toll rate hike is due in 2015.

With Silk\\u2019s concession to expire in 23 years on July 31, 2037, Tan said the highway\\u2019s compound annual growth rate is projected to grow at 17.2% since 2004. The deal, said Tan, will increase the length of IJM Corp\\u2019s toll roads to 362.8km, making it the second largest toll road owner and operator after UEM Group Bhd\\u2019s PLUS Malaysia Bhd, which currently operates a 772km highway stretching from Bukit Kayu Hitam in Kedah to Johor Baru. He explained that the offer price of RM398 million effectively valued Silk at around RM1.25 billion, and 13 times EV/Ebitda, which appears to be pricey in relation to 10 to 11 times of listed toll roads. Tan is maintaining a \\u201cneutral\\u201d call on the stock with a lower target price of RM6.80 as he believes that IJM Corp is fairly valued for now. MIDF Research analyst Hafiz Hassan said the deal could enhance IJM Corp\\u2019s future recurring income with the Silk Highway expected to benefit from the construction of the Kuala Lumpur Outer Ring Road, which will provide a surge in traffic volume. He added that once the deal is completed, Silk Highway is expected to contribute up to RM8 million to IJM Corp\\u2019s earnings in financial years 2015 and 2016 ending March 31. MIDF Research is recommending a \\u201cbuy\\u201d on IJM Corp, with a target price RM7.26.

It currently operates a fleet size of 18, as well as multiple third-party vessels.

The lower profit was mainly due to the increase in raw material prices and higher electricity costs since the start of the year. However, interim dividend per share (DPS) was two sen, in line with our expectations. Net dividend payout ratio was 133% of net profit in 1QFY14. During the quarter, the company was hit by the rise in raw material prices and electricity tariffs. Raw materials make up more than 60% of production costs. Prices for some of its raw materials like polypropylene and polypropylene films rose 5% to 10% in the quarter. Tomypak had no choice but to absorb part of the higher costs. As selling prices to its multinational corporation customers (50% to 60% of its revenue) are renewed quarterly, we believe its 2QFY14 profit margin should see some signs of recovery if raw material prices stabilise in the current quarter. At the start of this year, electricity rates went up 17% and we estimate electricity costs to rise by around RM1.5 million in the current financial year, which the company will also likely have to absorb. The company\\u2019s balance sheet remains healthy, with net debt at only RM12 million or 0.1 times net gearing.

The group\\u2019s market capitalisation had grown from RM198 million since its listing in July 2011 to RM858 million as at May 23, underlining a 450% increase in its share price since then. Prestariang\\u2019s share price has risen 35.42% year-to-date, to close down one sen or 0.51% at RM1.95 last Friday. Prestariang chief executive officer Datuk Abu Hasan Ismail said the group had in fact met the first target set to reach a market capitalisation of RM500 million within three years of its listing. \\u201cOur theme for this year is to grow our recurring revenue businesses for sustainability. We aim to continue with our asset-light, cash-rich model and being a dividend yield stock,\\u201d he said in an interview with The Edge Financial Daily. The information and communication technology (ICT) service provider will also look to the O&G industry for continued growth opportunities. \\u201cIt makes business sense for us to venture into the O&G industry which is really hot right now. The industry needs trained employees and we bring something different in the sense that those who graduate from our training academy will receive certification, which will then allow them to progress in their careers,\\u201d said Abu Hasan. Prestariang sees the O&G industry eventually overtaking the ICT sector to become the group\\u2019s major contributor to its core business of training. \\u201cThe [ICT] segment would eventually contribute a smaller percentage to the group\\u2019s earnings as Prestariang looks towards O&G and possibly other sectors to expand into,\\u201d said Abu Hasan. \\u201cThis doesn\\u2019t mean that we are moving away from the ICT business. Rather, we hope that in time the O&G industry will also become a part of our core business,\\u201d he added. The next phase for the group\\u2019s ICT business would be to move into security, cloud computing and big data analytics. Last year, Prestariang ventured into the O&G sector by setting up a training school in Kuala Selangor to train, upskill and reskill graduates and professionals. The academy, known as Petroleum Academy Malaysia, has since been closed and relocated to Johor and will start operations next month with an initial intake of 100 students for upskilling courses. The academy can house a maximum of 500 students. The academy is a 70:30 joint venture between Prestariang\\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, Prestariang Technology Sdn Bhd and YPJ Holdings Sdn Bhd, an investment arm of the Johor Education Foundation. \\u201cWhen we approached them (the Johor government), they were more than happy because they did not have any partnership or a plan to train the skill set needed for Pengerang,\\u201d Abu Hasan recalled. It was reported that the Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex will require some 70,000 skilled employees. Abu Hasan said Prestariang plans to open another O&G training school in Sarawak by the end of this year, but did not elaborate. As for the group\\u2019s venture into the education business with its University Malaysia of Computer Science & Engineering (UniMy), providing specialised computer science and engineering education, Abu Hasan expects the institution to \\u201cbreak even\\u201d by the end of the year.

As the main supplier of jet fuel to MAS, Norziana is of the view that PetDag could be affected by the national carrier\\u2019s route rationalisation. The reason is that PetDag is the biggest supplier of jet fuel at the KL International Airport in Sepang, with MAS being its major customer. It also serves MAS at Heathrow, Hong Kong, Denpasar, Batam and Pekan Baru airports. \\u201cPetDag now controls around 70% of Malaysia\\u2019s jet fuel market, up from 63% as at March 2007,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIn 1QFY14, commercial business contributed 43% to PetDag\\u2019s sales volume.

However, a lower requirement for jet fuel from MAS could be mitigated by higher take-up by foreign airlines or new supply contracts, said Norziana. \\u201cIn 1QFY14, PetDag landed new contracts from Air France, Malindo and Turkish Airlines. Other existing customers include Emirates, Qatar and Federal Express,\\u201d she said.

The announcement came after Suria Capital settled the outstanding land premium for the JQ site (in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah) and obtained a separate title document issued to Suria Capital.  On May 16, SBC also launched its master plan for the JQ project. The settlement of the outstanding land premium and securing of the land title are positive developments for SBC.

However, some say the construction outfit turned property developer, which has a strong presence in Sabah, needs to have landbank in more locations.  The JQ project, announced a year ago, has a gross development value of RM1.8 billion and is a joint venture with landowner Suria Capital Holdings Bhd. SBC has exclusive rights to develop the project and will be required to make staggered payments to Suria Capital for land use. Suria Capital is entitled to 18% of the GDV, with the balance going to SBC.  The JV with the local-listed port operator is expected to be a significant potential earnings driver, leading to analysts giving the stock a consensus target price of RM4.50.  SBC managing director Sia Teong Heng says the group has a healthy GDV pipeline, RM200 million of which will be launched by year-end. \\u201cOur modest RM200 million launch for financial year 2014 includes phase one of the JQ development, The Peak Collection, Kiara East, Cantonment Exchange and Genting Vale in the foothills of Genting Highlands,\\u201d he says.  SBC has property projects in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah, with a landbank of about 1,100 acres.  The group is working on several property projects with a combined GDV of RM6.2 billion over the next 10 years. These projects are the JQ development, The Peak Collection in Kota Kinabalu (GDV: RM500 million), Kiara East in Jalan Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur (RM1.5 billion) and Cantonment Exchange also in Jalan Ipoh (RM200 million), Bandar Ligamas in Batang Kali with PKNS (RM1.7 billion) and a 50-acre development in Batang Kali (RM500 million).  Nevertheless, despite the large potential GDV contribution from its projects, some are of the view that SBC lacks prime land to grow further and gain a stronger foothold in the property market.  As more property developers expand their landbank, especially in prime locations, SBC has remained in its comfort zone of Kota Kinabalu, the Klang Valley and Kuantan. Sia points out that the group will continue to replenish its landbank in areas it is familiar with. SBC has been focusing on the Kota Kinabalu property market for over a decade while developing mid-range properties in the Klang Valley.  Sia says the group will continue to see strong contributions from the Kota Kinabalu property market.  \\u201c2014 is an exciting year as we push towards the commencement of JQ, arguably Kota Kinabalu\\u2019s most exciting central business district and waterfront transformation project,\\u201d he says. \\u00a0 JQ offers residential towers that are expected to be priced as high as RM1,000 psf, commercial elements going for a maximum of RM1,200 psf and retail lots starting from RM2,000 psf.  The project also has several tourist elements, including an international cruise terminal, a convention centre, a hotel and retail components. \\u201cAt the moment, we are looking forward to the commencement at Jesselton Quay, since our joint-venture condition precedents have almost been fully met with the landowner, Suria Capital, just having paid up for the land at the end of April 2014,\\u201d says Sia. Despite concerns over slowing demand for property, he believes now is a good time for buyers to look at the market. \\u201cThere is fresh impetus. As the traditional property buying quarters \\u2014 the second and third quarters \\u2014 start, people will begin to factor in the significance of inflation-push cost, urban migration and lifestyle as well as demographic changes,\\u201d he says. He points out that these are the key drivers of property purchases. He adds that the cooling measures by Bank Negara Malaysia will only curb speculators.  \\u201cPockets of opportunities continue to exist to sustain developers, in terms of better design and affordability as well as genuine demand in undiscovered, old neighbourhoods throughout the country,\\u201d says Sia. CIMB Research\\u2019s Nigel Foo is of the view that demand will normalise by mid-2014 and strengthen by year-end.  \\u201cWe think that demand will strengthen later in the year as potential buyers realise that property prices will rise before the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax of 6% in April 2015,\\u201d he says.  Nevertheless, he points out that although SBC is able to sustain its high profit margin with its current projects, the group needs to expand further in the Klang Valley.  \\u201cSBC is involved in developing affordable, mid-range properties in the Klang Valley, which enjoy strong demand. Its landbank is cheap, which means that the company will be able to sustain its high profit margin,\\u201d says Foo.  \\u201cHowever, the company needs to raise its profile in the Klang Valley. Although SBC is a household name in Kota Kinabalu, not many investors are aware of the company.\\u201d  He says SBC is a small-cap property company that is worth looking into. He has given the stock an \\u201cadd\\u201d rating and a target price of RM3.96.  RHB Research\\u2019s Alia Arwina is another analyst who sees potential in the stock, with a target price of RM2.98 on the counter.

Its projects in Kiara East and Batang Kali should also provide the company with steady earnings growth,\\u201d she adds.  For SBC\\u2019s financial year ended March 31, 2013, the group posted a higher net profit of RM27.9 million, compared with last year\\u2019s RM22.7 million.

In a note, Yap said MAS\\u2019 losses might worsen sequentially in 2QFY14 as the group abstained from all marketing activities for two months following the MH370 incident. He said this could lead to a bigger decline in international yields as China sales collapsed 60% during March. \"We tweak our loss forecast for FY14 down slightly on offsetting adjustments, and lower FY15 - 16 losses by 13 - 26% on the assumption of gradual yield recovery and more fuel efficiencies,\" Yap said.

If the index is able to break above the immediate resistance level of 1,870 points, it confirms the triangle pattern which has a short-term target at 1,900 points. I am expecting the market to be bullish this week as the technical indicators on the KLCI are being supported well. The index is expected to test this immediate resistance level this week and climb higher in the short term towards 1,900 points, unless there are any reversal indications. If the KLCI fails to break above 1,870 points, then expect it to further consolidate sideways. Daily FBM KLCI chart as at May 12, 2014.

At 12.30 pm noon break, Eco World\\u2019s share price increased by 23 sen or 4.9% to RM4.89 with some 1.8 million shares done. The counter was among the top 10 gainers on Bursa Malaysia, rising as much as 32 sen or 6.9% to a high of RM4.98. In a note, CIMB's research head Terence Wong said property developer Eco World is undergoing a major transformation, which will put the firm on investor\\u2019s radar. Eco World is linked to SP Setia Bhd's former chief Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin as it is controlled by his son. \"Eco World is undergoing a major transformation that will put it high on investor\\u2019s radar. It is likely to become the most-watched and exciting developer in the coming years as it has the DNA of the best-managed property company in Malaysia, i.e. SP Setia. \"Tan Sri Liew joined Eco World's board on May 5 as a non-independent and non-executive director and he brings with him the credibility and track record that made SP Setia Malaysia's best and most-admired developer,\" Wong said. Eco World said last week Liew had emerged as a substantial shareholder in the firm with an indirect 35.05% stake. Liew owns the stake comprising 88.8 milion shares through his son Tian Xiong's direct equity portion in the firm. Maybank Investment Bank Bhd (Maybank IB) had also highlighted the stock in its property sector note today, saying that Eco World is \\u201cthe new bellwether for the property sector\\u201d. \"Eco World Development (ECW MK) gained much interest from Singapore investors while it is a new name to Hong Kong and US investors,\" said Maybank IB."}, "48": {"date_posted": "9/5/2014", "title": "Trade Wise: Magnum Bhd worth a second look?", "article": " IT HAS been close to a year since Magnum Bhd, formerly known as Multi-Purpose Holdings Bhd, underwent a major restructuring that separated its gaming and non-gaming entities \\u2014 a move meant to unlock value for shareholders. While the demerger has boosted its non-gaming entity MPHB Capital Bhd, evident from its share price gain of 42.33% since the exercise was completed in June 2013, the same can\\u2019t be said for Magnum. Magnum appears to have fallen out of favour with investors since the demerger, shedding 9.3% from the time it reached its peak of RM3.33 on Aug 13, 2013, to last Wednesday. The share price currently hovers between RM2.95 and RM3.05. Analysts say expectations that moderating consumer spending \\u2014 due to rising inflationary pressure \\u2014 will impact sales has contributed to weak sentiment in the counter. The lurking uncertainty as to how the upcoming Goods and Services Tax (GST) will impact number forecasting operators such as Magnum places further pressure on the share price, they add. However, at current levels of about RM3 per share, some analysts opine that Magnum\\u2019s shares have become a good bargain as they offer a dividend yield of 6%. Unsurprisingly, some institutional funds have upped their stake in the gaming operator. \\u201cThere is value in Magnum at this price level \\u2014 all the negative news about GST and rising cost of living has been priced into the share price. The dividend yield is good at 6% and I believe that it is sustainable,\\u201d says CIMB Research analyst Lucius Chong. Magnum declared a fourth interim dividend of five sen per share in its fourth quarter results ended Dec 31, 2013, bringing its total dividend for the year to 20 sen per share. Magnum\\u2019s dividend yield of 6% is more attractive than that of other dividend darlings that investors usually chase after. Based on last Tuesday\\u2019s share price, Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd provides a yield of 4.58%, while Nestl\\u00e9 (M) Bhd\\u2019s is at 3.4% and British American Tobacco (M) Bhd, 4.7%.Some analysts say Magnum could further pay out a special dividend via borrowings, sweetening the investment prospect for investors. This would not be an uncommon move, they note, pointing out that competitor Berjaya Sports Toto Bhd (BToto) had gone down that route previously to pay out dividends. As at Dec 31, 2013, Magnum\\u2019s net gearing stood at 0.24 times. It had total borrowings of RM1.013 billion, consisting of medium-term notes and revolving credit, and RM425.95 million in cash and cash balances. Of 10 analysts that track the stock, six have a \\u201chold\\u201d call on it while the remaining four have a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call, according to Bloomberg data. Their target prices range from RM3.04 to RM3.65. Based on the most bullish target price of RM3.65, by CIMB Research, Magnum\\u2019s shares have an upside potential of 20.86% from its closing price of RM3.02 last Wednesday. Magnum had already touched Maybank Investment Bank Research\\u2019s target price of RM3.04 by mid-Tuesday last week. Maybank IB Research has a \\u201chold\\u201d call on the stock. Following the demerger, MPHB Capital holds the financial services, hospitality and property investment businesses. For the financial year 2013 ended Dec 31, Magnum raked in a profit from its continuing operations \\u2014 gaming and investment holding \\u2014 of RM334.59 million on the back of RM2.991 billion in revenue. Earnings from its continuing operations came in higher by 29.8% compared with the previous year\\u2019s restated continuing operating profit of RM257.71 million, due to a lower prize payout ratio from the gaming division and lower finance cost and operating expenses for the group.The group highlighted that gaming revenue was affected by one less draw during the year, the weaker economic environment and competition from illegal operators, resulting in a decline of RM97.2 million in FY2013 from the previous year. Some analysts are less keen on the stock because they foresee minimal growth in earnings for the coming financial year as consumers cut back on expenses due to the rise in living costs. An analyst with a bank-backed research house says the limited number of game choices under Magnum, consisting of only the 4D jackpot, has also put it at a disadvantage compared with its industry peer BToto. BToto\\u2019s shares currently trade at RM3.89 (as at last Wednesday) and offer a dividend yield of 5% based on its declared dividend as at its cumulative nine-month financial period ended Jan 31, 2014. HwangDBS Research, however, says in its research report that Magnum has successfully held on to its market share of 34% since the second quarter ended June 30, 2013. BToto nevertheless remains the market leader with a 42% market share. \\u201cMagnum\\u2019s numbers forecast operations (NFO) sales are showing signs of stabilising given the company\\u2019s strong following, as the novelty factor for its competitors\\u2019 new 4D jackpot games fade,\\u201d it says. The research house adds that while NFO sales may see an impact from weaker consumer sentiment, the impact will likely be minimal given Magnum\\u2019s small-ticket-item nature and resilient historical track record.

Jittery and mixed performances at global markets caused investors and traders to be cautious, especially about slower China economic growth. The market was also directionless in the past one week. The KLCI was almost unchanged in a week, rising only a point to 1,860.43 points after trading in a range of between 1,852.27 and 1,871.69 points. Being cautious, trading volume continued to decline and this time it was drastic. The average daily trading volume in the past one week was only 1.5 billion shares compared with 2.3 billion shares two weeks ago. The average trading value was at RM1.7 billion compared with RM2.0 billion two weeks ago, indicating that institutions were probably the main players on Bursa Malaysia in the past one week as higher priced stocks were being traded. Foreign institutions continued to be net buyers from last Monday to Friday. The stronger ringgit may be the catalyst for foreign buying. Net buying from foreign institutions amounted to RM402.4 million while net selling by local institutions and retail investors came to RM288.6 and RM113.8 million respectively. In the KLCI, gainers marginally beat decliners 16 to 13.

Crude palm oil continued to be pressured, falling 2.7% in a week and 10% in two months to RM2,568 per tonne yesterday. The KLCI has remained in a sideways correction of a short-term uptrend and has formed a triangle chart pattern. The index has pulled back to slightly above the 30-day moving average. The index is still bullish in the long term and there are no signs that the trend may change except for the weaker bullish momentum in the short term. The short-term or immediate support level is at 1,845 points. The immediate resistance level is at 1,870 points. The bullish trend should be able to continue if the index is able to break above the immediate resistance level. However, the weak momentum indicates that the possibility of the index climbing higher is low. Momentum indicators like the RSI and MACD are still in a divergence against the KLCI and this indicates that the resistance is getting stronger and hence the weaker bullish momentum. The Bollinger Bands is contracting and the index is at the middle band of this indicator. This indicates uncertainty. The market is hanging in a balance between the bull and the bear. The indicators basically show that the market is uncertain. However, this will change if the index breaks above the resistance level of 1,870 points or below the support level of 1,845 points.A breakout above 1,870 points will confirm the triangle chart pattern with a target of 1,900 points. A break below 1,845 points will cause confidence to weaken and the next support level the index will test is 1,800 points. Continue to expect the KLCI to consolidate further between 1,850 and 1,870 points with a bias towards the lower level because of the rising resistance.

With the recent run-up in CIMB\\u2019s share price, upside remains fairly minimal at 4.5%, and the stock is currently trading at a slightly higher P/BV multiple of 1.6 times FY14E and 1.5 times FY15E (from its recent low of 1.5 times FY14E).  We believe that investors should hold on to the stock. In our view, the stabilising regional outlook, driven by lower volatility and currency risks, coupled with management\\u2019s mitigative measures to stem net interest margin (NIM) compression, will be CIMB\\u2019s key earnings drivers for FY14 to FY16 and sustain the share price.  Although this appears largely to have been priced in (as per our valuation, which is based on FY15E earnings), we continue to be positive on CIMB\\u2019s outlook and will look for potential surprises such as: (i) a recovery in mark-to-market losses and higher trade volumes to underpin non-interest income growth; (ii) a sharper improvement in the cost-to-income ratio from our current forecast of 56% for FY14; and (iii) a pick up in deal flow, driven by the Royal Bank of Scotland\\u2019s (RBS) investment bank platform and network. Although management remains cautious on its Indonesian operations\\u2019 (30% of profit before tax [PBT]) banking outlook, it believes its domestic operations will continue to sustain group earnings and remain the key driver (at about 60% of group PBT).  According to management, approval rates for new mortgages in Malaysia are still on an uptrend, but the growth rate is tapering off as CIMB has shifted its strategy to target the preferred and prime customer segments rather than the mass market. CIMB is targeting a larger share of the consumer and corporate wallet through cross-selling, instead of getting the highest pricing for loan products.  Overall, management has guided for Malaysia/Singapore loans to grow at 11% to 12% per annum, while Indonesia has reiterated its growth target of about 13% to 14% per annum.  Meanwhile, the other overseas unit RBS (which was acquired in April 2012), still has not contributed meaningfully to the group due to slower deal flow, although the pipeline remains robust. In our view, NIMs in the banking industry are facing a new norm as new loans are being priced lower due to stiff industry competition (prevailing low interest rates are another dampener). Overall, management is guiding for a decline of five basis points (bps) to 15bps in FY14 group NIM.  Management has guided for a more stable 1QFY14 NIM outlook for Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, while funding cost pressure in Indonesia should continue to pressure the overall group NIM. Key risks to our view include: (i) a more drastic NIM compression than our FY14 forecast of 2.82%; (ii) lower loan growth versus our conservative forecast of 10% per annum for FY14 to FY16; and (iii) a higher requirement for capital buffers, hence raising cost of funds. \\u2014 Affin Investment Bank, May 5 This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on May 6, 2014."}, "54": {"date_posted": "5/5/2014", "title": "Hot Stock: UMW O&G rises 3% as it bids for 20 jobs worth RM1.9b", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (May 5): UMW Oil & Gas Corporation Bhd rose as much as 3% in morning trades on news it is bidding for 20 contracts worth a total of RM1.9 billion.

The Edge Weekly in its cover story said that the RM200 billion worth of jobs in the pipeline for the next 20 years had been carrots for investors and driven up valuations. However, as the government nears the end of its fiscal rope and the property market slows down, investors will have to reassess the potential risk of delays in these mega projects, it said. It said that although the short and mid-term fundamentals of most of the construction players are still intact and they have sizeable order books to keep them busy until the end of next year, the problem is that many of the mega-projects in the pipeline would not be awarded anytime soon. Citing Gadang Holdings Bhd major shareholder and managing director Tan Sri Kok Onn, the Edge said that the only major projects that will go ahead this year were those of Petronas in the form of RAPID and RAPID Phase 2. It said the RM60 billion RAPID (Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development) project that falls under the Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex recently received the final investment decision from Petroliam Nasional Bhd and Kok expects several of its packages to be awarded in the next six months, including the co-generation power plant and the infrastructure jobs that Gadang was bidding for. However, the bulk of the RAPID project\\u2019s cost will go to the oil and gas players and equipment suppliers with only a small slice for civil and infrastructure works. Thus, some economists are expecting the construction sector to grow at a slower pace than the consensus forecast of 10% this year, it said. The weekly said infrastructure projects accounted for 20.4% of new construction contracts in 2013, down from an average of 31.4% from 2007 to 2013. Looking ahead, no tenders will be awarded for the massive RM25 billion second Klang Valley Mass Rapid Transit line soon, although the Cabinet approved the project last month, it added. The weekly noted that project manager MRT Corp has said tenders for the rail project will only be called next year after the public display, environmental impact assessment, land acquisitions and fine-tuning of the alignment have been completed. It is highly unlikely that a project this size and with high multiplier value will be scrapped, but a lengthy delay could be costly. Players like Gamuda Bhd and MMC Corp Bhd have invested heavily in 10 tunnel-boring machines for Line One. The equipment makes the MMC-Gamuda partnership a strong contender for the next tunnelling package, but it could mean expensive holding costs if there is no timely deployment of the machines, say industry observers. Following the government\\u2019s cooling measures, the residential property market is expected to see a slowdown. And given that 30% of new contracts came from residential projects last year, any weakening will have a substantial impact on the sector. The weekly also quoted RHB Research Institute\\u2019s chief economist Lim Chee Sing as saying that potential homebuyers were also facing hurdles in securing bank financing with loan rejection rates potentially as high as 30% based on recent reports. As a result, there could be a delay in the rolling- out of several mega property developments planned in the Klang Valley because these are highly dependent on market demand to get off the ground, it said. The RM50 billion development by the EPF\\u2019s wholly-owned Kwasa Land Sdn Bhd on the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia\\u2019s (RRIM) 2,330 acres in the heart of the Klang Valley could be the largest to be affected, noted the weekly. However, despite the slowdown in the near term, longer-term support for the industry remains intact, said the weekly. \\u201cLooking ahead, the fundamental drivers remain supportive of the construction sector amid continued fiscal consolidation. Progress in existing projects in the transport, utility, highway, power plant and oil and gas sectors as well as housing development projects should ensure the sector expands at a healthy pace,\\u201d it quoted CIMB Research\\u2019s chief economist Lee Heng Guie as saying. The weekly in its analysis pointed out that the KL Construction Index had climbed 20% in the past 12 months after construction stocks found with investors again following the general election in May last year.

Despite several analysts expressing bullish views on the sector, the weekly explained that not all was rosy for construction stocks when one looked beyond the long list of construction jobs in the pipeline.

The exercise will, however, dilute its earnings per share (EPS) and return on equity (ROE). This was why investors\\u2019 immediate reaction to the news announced on Tuesday was to sell down the shares. The bank\\u2019s share price\\u00a0fell by as much 1.4% to RM19.88, before gaining some ground to close at RM20.14 on Wednesday, just 0.1% lower than the previous day\\u2019s price. The counter was actively traded with some 11.6 million shares changing hands, about 3\\u00bd times more than that in the previous day. \\u201cWhat is positive is that this fundraising would bolster its CET-1 ratio to a comfortable 10.4% thereafter,\\u201d Maybank Investment Bank (Maybank IB) Research said in a note on Wednesday. \\u201cWe estimate the financial impact to be a 7% dilution to financial year 2015 (FY15) EPS and a dilution in the group\\u2019s FY15 return on average equity from [earlier expectations of] 19.1% to 17.7%,\\u201d it said. It maintained its \\u2018sell\\u2019 call and target price of RM18.00 on the stock. CET-1 provides the benchmark on how banks are well-capitalised. Public Bank\\u2019s CET-1 ratio stood at 8.5% as at end-March, much lower than the industry average of over 12.8%, but comfortably above the minimum 7% that banks need to meet by 2019, as per Bank Negara Malaysia\\u2019s (BNM) Basel III requirements. However, BNM is also considering introducing counter-cyclical capital buffers, which may eventually push up the minimum requirement further. Analysts said this may be pushed up by 2.5% at the most. It had been long expected that Public Bank would need to raise funds to boost its\\u00a0capital position and it had hinted to analysts that such a move would be done via a rights issue, as opposed to a private placement of new shares. Bigger rival CIMB Group Holdings Bhd earlier this year opted for a private placement, raising RM3.55 billion to strengthen its capital position. However, analysts were surprised that Public Bank had decided to undertake the rights issue earlier. \\u201cIt comes much earlier than anticipated as the management has often said it would decide only after Bank Negara sets the counter-cyclical buffer in 2015/2016. That management has decided to bring this forward could be to take advantage of the recent spike in share price,\\u201d Maybank IB Research pointed out. Public Bank\\u2019s share price surged to a multi-year high of RM20.80 on April 4, \\u00a0following a four-day uptrend during which it gained 8.6%. The interest came after the bank\\u2019s announcement on March 31 that it would merge its local and foreign shares on April 16, a move which lifted its investible weighting on FTSE\\u2019s Value-Stocks Asean Index. \\u201cWe believe that this is an opportune time to undertake such an exercise given that its share price is riding high which will help to minimise the EPS dilution impact,\\u201d Hong Leong Investment Bank Research said, adding that it was \\u201cneutral to slightly positive\\u201d on the rights issue. Public Bank said the rights issue would be at a discount of 20% to 35% to its theoretical ex-rights price. The exercise is expected to be completed by the third quarter.  Public Bank says the rights issue will be at a discount of 20% to 35% to its theoretical ex-rights price and the exercise is expected to be completed by the third quarter. \\u201cAssuming a price discount of 27% [mid-point between the 20% and 35% discount] and a volume weighted average price of RM19.97, we estimate a 1-for-10 rights issue to raise the RM5 billion,\\u201d Maybank IB Research said. According to Bloomberg data, at least 27 analysts that track Public Bank\\u2019s stock, most of them (15) have a \\u201chold\\u201d, with seven maintaining a \\u2018sell\\u2019 and the rest, a \\u201cbuy\\u201d. Analysts said Public Bank\\u2019s ROE, the highest among local banks, has peaked and is now on a declining trend. Its ROE stood at 20.5% as at March 31. HwangDBS Vickers Research forecast that the group\\u2019s ROE would be around 19% following the rights issue, which it said is still the highest among Malaysian banks. It maintained its \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the stock. \\u201cAfter the rights issue, PBB investors will no longer need to worry about the bank not meeting the Basel III requirements. In addition, its management will be able to focus solely on growing the business,\\u201d it said. The research house expects Public Bank\\u2019s dividend payout ratio (DPR) to stop sliding and assumes that it will be sustainable at 40% up to FY18.

Hofbauer, who is also the group\\u2019s regional head for Malaysia and Singapore, said the situation is expected to last for \\u201ca certain period until consumers get used to the new prices\\u201d of Nestle products and resume their previous buying patterns. \\u201cI think the reality will be that you may see a faster value (pricing) growth than what you see in volume growth,\\u201d Hofbauer told The Edge Financial Daily in an interview. Nestle Malaysia had raised the selling prices of some of its milk and ready-to-drink products in the first quarter ended March 31 of financial year 2014 (1QFY14). It recently announced that it will be raising the prices of its Milo range by 5% to 7% this month. Hofbauer, however, stressed that the group had turned to increasing the prices of its products as a last resort as it copes with rising prices of milk, coffee and cocoa, which make up the bulk of its raw material costs. Nestle Malaysia\\u2019s revenue grew in the range of 5.1% to 7.5% for the past five years, from FY09 to FY13. For 1QFY14, the group recorded a 3.7% increase in revenue to RM1.27 billion, buoyed by a 9.2% rise in domestic performance. Domestic sales accounted for 75% of the group\\u2019s revenue last year. For 1QFY14, the group\\u2019s gross margin rose slightly to 37.2% from 36.5% a year ago. Hofbauer said the group sees slight impact from the \\u201cflattish\\u201d F&B market as consumer sentiment weakens due to rising inflation. He, however, assured that the impact on the group\\u2019s earnings is not material as there will still be demand for Nestle products. \\u201cWe are in a business where most people need to eat and drink. Yes, there is negative impact (from inflation), but are you going to stop drinking Milo, or stop having Maggie Mee?\\u201d he asked. He noted that Malaysians\\u2019 overall disposable income for food is still \\u201cmanageable\\u201d, adding that the drop in the group\\u2019s sales volume was much worse during the global financial crisis of 2008. \\u201cWhen you talk about our (F&B) industry, yes, there will be an impact if the whole economy slows down, but it\\u2019s still a safer place to be than let\\u2019s say, luxury goods or fashion.\\u201d While any price increase is done \\u201csensitively\\u201d to manage any adverse impact, Hofbauer said the group is also mindful of offering \\u201cvalue-up\\u201d products, that is, giving more to its consumers for the same amount of money. This is done through continuous \\u201crenovation and innovation\\u201d of its product line. Moving forward, Nestle Malaysia will remain focused on growing its net profit and revenue as it continues to deliver the \\u201cNestle model\\u201d which seeks 5% to 6% organic growth annually. The group has allocated RM280 million in capital expenditure (capex) this year, the bulk of which will go to its new Sri Muda factory in Shah Alam, Selangor, which will boost the capacity of its ready-to-drink segment by 75%. It is worth noting that its capex for 2014 is the highest in five years. Nestle Malaysia currently has 500 products under its portfolio, and sells almost eight million products daily, said Hofbauer. While it is hard to generalise the growth attributed by various product categories as they each have a different base, Hofbauer said: \\u201cWhat we have seen in the last few years in Malaysia is that convenience and ready-to-drink offerings tend to grow faster than some of our more traditional products.\\u201d He noted that there are no products that fall below the management\\u2019s performance expectations. Meanwhile, Hofbauer said the group still allocates the bulk of its advertising money to the traditional media. But as consumers\\u2019 media consumption habits have changed, and unless traditional media has a convincing case to retain its audience, Nestle Malaysia will shift its ad spend \\u201cmassively\\u201d to the digital space. \\u201cToday, we are one of the top three advertisers in Malaysia. If I say we will double our (advertising and promotion) spend on digital (media), it\\u2019s a number which may be even understating what we\\u2019re going to do,\\u201d he added. Selling and distribution expenses accounted for RM824.4 million or 17.2% of Nestle Malaysia\\u2019s revenue of RM4.79 billion for FY13, up from 16.6% in FY12. CIMB Research and HLIB Research in their April 18 reports have a \\u201chold\\u201d call on the stock, with target prices of RM67.62 and RM67.16 respectively.

CIMB Group said CIMB Niaga's interest income climbed to Rp4.5 trillion from Rp3.89 trillion. Non-interest income was higher at Rp1.16 trillion versus Rp1.12 trillion. CIMB Niaga president director Arwin Rasyid said : \"The year ahead will remain a challenging one for Indonesia's banking industry, with expectations of a better second half compared to the first.\\u201d As at March 31, CIMB Niaga's loan book rose 9.5% to Rp160.96 trillion from a year earlier.

Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) announced that its banking unit in Indonesia, PT Bank International Indonesia Tbk (BII), recorded a net profit plunge of 39% to Rp189 billion for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014. BII attributed this to tight net interest margins (NIM) and provisions for selected corporate debtors. In a statement, BII said the increasing cost of funds and challenging market conditions impacted the bank\\u2019s NIM, which declined to 4.03% from 4.58%. But the bank\\u2019s loans portfolio grew 27% to Rp101.3 trillion, while assets increased 18% to Rp140.1 trillion. The bank said its customer deposits increased 16.5% to Rp104.0 trillion, contributed by a significant increase in savings deposits of 24.7%. It added the loan to deposit ratio remains healthy at 88.91% in the first quarter this year. BII said its total capital increased to Rp15.0 trillion in March this year from Rp12.4 trillion in the previous year. Its capital adequacy ratio with credit, operational and market risk hit 13.29%.

However, revenue for the quarter was slightly lower at RM210.8 million from RM213.6 million a year ago.

Asset quality remains stable, and there was no change to the 80bps to 100bps credit cost guidance. Generally, there were no major issues in terms of asset quality, and management has not noted any systemic issues. CIMB Group retained its group credit cost expectations of 30bps to 40bps for 2014 (2013: 30bps). It guided for group NIM compression of 5bps to 15bps this year (2013: -19bps).

Equities had a slower quarter in 1Q14, but management said the pipeline was strong and much would depend on market conditions. On the whole, with management largely keeping its outlook intact, we are also retaining our view on the group. CIMB Group offers strong leverage to the expected pick-up in corporate lending as well as capital market activities, which we believe will be well supported by the ongoing roll-out of projects under the various economic programmes.

We forecast an earnings CAGR of 7.7% over the next three years, largely capped by the decommissioning of YTLP\\u2019s Malaysian power plants in FY16 in the event its power purchase agreement is not renewed. However, we are more than confident that YTL will be able to fill the vacuum with a new stream of earnings. The privatisation of YTLC illustrated how much value YTL can unlock with restructuring. If YTL repeats the same share swap exercise for its remaining listed subsidiaries \\u2014 YTLP, YTL Land & Development Bhd and YTL e-Solutions Bhd \\u2014 we estimate a potential FY15 earnings per share accretion of 8.9%, with return on equities improving from 10.9% to 12.3% and dividend per share almost doubling.

This positive development comes just a month after we wrote about the early delivery of Naga 5, which will join UMW-OG\\u2019s fleet next week, a month earlier than the original schedule. Unlike Naga 7, Naga 5 already has a contract waiting for it. In mid-May, the jack-up will start servicing a six-week US$7 million (RM22.82 million) drilling contract awarded by Nido Petroleum Ltd for work in the Philippines. The contract value translates into an attractive daily charter rate of approximately US$165,000 due to the short work period. We are encouraged by UMW-OG\\u2019s fleet expansion programme, which has been throwing up positive scheduling surprises.

Based on our FY14 net profit forecast of RM4,866.5 million for CIMB Group, the Thai unit\\u2019s annualised results amount to a share of about 9% and is ahead of our forecast, which is close to 8% of group\\u2019s earnings. Among others, the key operating income drivers for CIMB Thai\\u2019s 1QFY14 results were a 27% y-o-y expansion in net interest income, underpinned by early redemption of hybrid instruments and improved net interest margins to 3.27% from 3.18% y-o-y, net fee and services income growth of 23.1% y-o-y, and a robust 106% expansion in non-interest income, on the back of a 137% gain in forex profit and a fourfold increase in investment gain of 200 million baht.

As a result of this, the loan loss coverage ratio decreased to 100.6% in 1QFY14 from 107.8% in 4QFY13 though the group had stepped up gross provisions for the period.

Last Wednesday Pengurusan Asset Air Bhd, the national water asset management company, awarded the long-awaited Langat 2 WTP contract to a consortium comprising Salcon Bhd, MMC Corp Bhd and Ahmad Zaki Resources Bhd. The Langat 2 WTP contract is worth RM994 million for the first phase, with the companies in the consortium holding stakes of 36%, 34% and 30% respectively Engtex, which is the only listed pipe manufacturer that has been a supplier to all the three winning contractors, is seen to be a frontrunner for the Langat 2 pipe contract. Tender estimated at 20% of the RM994 million project value is likely to be called by the joint-venture (JV) company as pipe contract, and this is likely to happen in the next three months, said CIMB Research\\u2019s Sharizan Rosely. He is of the view that the tender is likely to be called by the JV contractor soon, adding that the development order is expected to be granted as early as the second half of this year. As the pipe supply contract for the Langat 2 WTP will be restricted to pipes of larger diameter \\u2014 with specifications of between 1.6m and 2.2m in diameter \\u2014 this narrows the possible winners.

The group saw its full FY13 revenue declining marginally by 5.9% to RM658.3 million from RM699.7 million in FY12. Despite the marginal decline in top line numbers, Yee Lee recorded a significant 45.2% improvement in profit before tax to RM42.7 million in FY13 from RM29.4 million in FY12. The improved profitability can be attributed to the trading division, which performed exceptionally well in FY13, and the palm oil refinery and mill division which managed to report a turnaround. Its subsidiary, Spritzer Bhd, also recorded a substantial increase in profit contribution to the group to RM6.3 million in FY13 from RM4.4 million in FY12. A check of Bloomberg consensus reveals that only two research houses cover the stock with \\u201cbuy\\u201d calls. The stock is currently trading at a fair historical price-earnings ratio of 9.98 times and reasonable price-to-book value of 1.05 times. Yee Lee has a low indicative 12-month dividend yield of 1.32%. Maybank-IB first featured chart coverage on Yee Lee on April 10 at RM1.80. Its chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames are very strong. Its share price made an obvious surge since its daily Wave-2 low of RM1.22 on Dec 18, 2013. Since that RM1.22 low, Yee Lee surged to its recent April 2014 high of RM1.94. Its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to its recent April 2014 high of RM1.94. As it broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of RM1.48 and RM1.73, look to buy Yee Lee on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to long term uptrends for this stock. The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD, Stochastic and Oscillator) are very strong and now depict the firm indications of Yee Lee\\u2019s eventual move towards much higher levels. We expect Yee Lee to remain very well sought after on dips towards its support levels of RM1.48, RM1.73 and RM1.90. It may attract minor profit taking at the resistance levels of RM1.94, RM2.07 and RM2.21. Its upside targets are now located at RM2.12, RM2.24, RM2.55 and RM2.76.

The intention to increase its exposure to REITs is not unexpected but the planned asset injection of RM1 billion per annum that may include assets not owned by MRCB was a positive surprise.

Hypothetically, if QCT\\u2019s asset value rises to RM5 billion in the next five years, MRCB\\u2019s RNAV will increase by 19% from RM2.50 per share to RM2.37 per share, based on its around 30% stake in QCT.

He, however, said it would be treated as a promotional rate for the first year only, with the possibility of an upward revision after that.  This was one of the rare occasions the government had publically acknowledged its move to narrow down or close the PSC tariff gap between the main terminal building (MTB) and klia2. The deputy minister\\u2019s statement was not entirely a surprise, as we had already highlighted this potential in our Nov 21, 2013 report.  The current PSC for international flights is RM65 at the MTB against RM32 at the LCCT. For domestic flights,\\u00a0 it is RM9 at the MTB versus RM6 at the LCCT.  If the PSC increases, AirAsia will most likely have to cut its fares to keep the cost of travel down. Its fares (excluding ancillary) averaged RM166 per pax in 2013. When Singapore\\u2019s budget terminal was shut in September 2012, Tiger Airways saw an increase in its PSC from S$18 to S$34 per pax. Tiger only managed to pass through 60% of this increase, absorbing the remaining 40% by way of lower fares, causing \\u2014 in our estimation \\u2014 a deterioration in yields and earnings.  Separately, acting Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein said he had directed the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to perform safety checks on kliaA2, probably in response to AirAsia\\u2019s concerns on safety issues, but he sounded very unhappy with AirAsia\\u2019s demands.  With its relations with the government frayed, AirAsia will not be able to easily convince the government not to proceed with the tariff equalisation moves between klia2 and MTB. AirAsia was given a reprieve when the 9% to 10% PSC hike in February 2014 was put on hold, but it may not be so lucky in 2015. Another risk is the imposition of the 6% goods and services tax (GST) on domestic flights from April 1, 2015, which could deflate AirAsia\\u2019s fares.

The amount bought hit RM195.5 million on Monday, the third highest in a day this year. \\u201cIt tapered on Tuesday but buying remained steady throughout Wednesday to Friday, despite the upheavals on Wall Street and in Europe with respect to the tech sell-off, and the election outcome in Indonesia,\\u201d MIDF analyst Zulkifli Hamzah said in the research house\\u2019s fund flow report for the week ended April 11. The KLCI was strongly supported last week and closed above 1,850 for the third week in a row at 1,852.7 points. MIDF said the foreign participation rate remained elevated last week, with the average daily foreign participation rate at RM1.05 billion. Axiata Group Bhd recorded the highest net money inflow totalling RM3.23 million. Its share price, however, retreated 1.04% for the week in tandem with the broader market decline.  Oriental Holdings Bhd was the foreign funds\\u2019 second favourite stock last week, with a net inflow of RM2.43 million. Its share price rose 5.75% week-on-week despite the softer broader market, with its trade volume jumping to 4.41million units from a two-year weekly average of only 1.24 million units.  KPJ Healthcare Bhd attracted the third highest net money inflow of RM2.24million. Buying interest returned midweek, which catapulted the stock to close 8.39% higher during the review week.

Zulkifli said despite the reported surplus in the flow of funds in the last three weeks, Malaysia remained in the red for 2014. The year\\u2019s cumulative net withdrawal from Malaysian equity amounted to RM5.55 billion as of last week. However, this was a 20% reduction from the cumulative peak of RM6.9 billion. Zulkifli said Wall Street remains the world\\u2019s bellwether market for equity. \\u201cCurrently, the market in the US is in the process of \\u201cunwinding\\u201d, with prices retracing amid the occasional thematic sell-off, such as that witnessed last week with the technology sector rout.\\u201d He is cautious over the impact of Wall Street activity. \\u201cThe earnings reporting season for 1Q14 financials may turn unsavoury if many companies\\u2019 reports fall behind expectations. The sell-off of technology stocks last week, amid worries over earnings, is probably a taste of things to come. The market is heading into May, which is historically not a good month for Wall Street.\\u201d  He said uncertainty on Wall Street may be the catalyst for funds to hunt for value elsewhere, and Asia appears to be a prime target as seen by the flow of fund data in the past few weeks.

From having traded at just RM1.90 a year ago, the counter had risen 189% to close at RM5.50 last Friday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM1.1 billion.  A major reason for this rise \\u2014 apart from the group\\u2019s internal consolidation process which has improved profit margins \\u2014 is said to be the increased level of institutional shareholdings in the company.  Currently, institutional shareholdings in Bonia stand at 40%, compared with an estimated 15% to 20% a year ago. For instance, Milingtonia Ltd has emerged as one of the substantial shareholders of Bonia in August 2013, and currently holds a 7.25% stake in the group. Milingtonia is said to be linked with Creador Group, a long-term private equity firm focused on growth-orientated businesses. Group finance director Chong Chin Look told The Edge Financial Daily that Creador is deemed a strategic investor as it has introduced Bonia to the management of several shopping complexes in Indonesia, and has also assisted in the market survey of Bonia\\u2019s branding in Indonesia.  The institutional shareholdings in Bonia are also more diverse compared with several years ago, considering that Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) once held a dominant 32.99% stake in the retail group in June 2011. PNB has now ceased to be a shareholder of Bonia, having divested its stake gradually to other institutional funds including Creador. Moving forward, Datuk Albert Chiang, group managing director of Bonia, said the group is open to strategic partnerships but cautious in picking the right partner. \\u201cWe\\u2019re always open to strategic alliances [as we look] for synergies that can propel us further, beyond ... Southeast Asia, such as China or even the Middle East eventually,\\u201d said Chiang.  He said Bonia has been approached by a few parties, be it for a strategic alliance or a stake in Bonia, but the group has yet to make any decisions.  The Chiang family, through Bonia Holdings Sdn Bhd, Freeway Team Sdn Bhd, and family members, collectively own half of the group.

Since October last year, after the government announced a slew of measures in Budget 2014 to cool the property market down, the group has entered into agreements to acquire about RM1.25 billion worth of land in various parts of the country.  Among the acquisitions were large tracts for township developments, including 85.43 acres in Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah (SSAAS) Golf Course in Section 13, Shah Alam, for RM327.48 million cash last week and 1,351.84 acres in Plentong, Johor Baru, for RM411.16 million. The Plentong deal was announced last October, but some issues remain to be ironed out. With strong incoming cash flow expected from its ongoing projects, management says Mah Sing has the capacity to buy more land to sustain its growth momentum.  The group achieved its targeted sales growth of 20% in 2013 and hit RM3 billion of sales. For 2014, managing director and CEO Tan Sri Leong Hoy Kum has again hoped for 20% sales growth to reach RM3.6 billion. But this could be a tall order, given the higher base and the fact that sentiment has cooled somewhat in the property market.  But Leong remains positive. \\u201cProperty is a cyclical industry; we always react differently, depending on the property cycle. Mah Sing is not mid-end or high-end-focused, but offering the right type of products at an attractive price point to fit the property cycle,\\u201d he tells The Edge in an email interview. While some quarters worry that Mah Sing may be overstretching itself in a challenging market environment, Leong believes the group has enough financial muscle. \\u201cOur unbilled sales position had grown to RM4.4 billion as at end-December 2013, assuring us of near-term revenue visibility and steady streams of cash flow and liquidity. The RM4.4 billion is going to be recognised over two to three years from now, which will further boost our cash pile.\\u201d  As at Dec 31, 2013, Mah Sing\\u2019s cash position stood at RM822.29 million against long-term borrowings of RM841.2 million and RM283.7 million in bonds. \\u201cWe now have 47 projects with a remaining gross development value (GDV) and unbilled sales of RM31.26 billion in Malaysia\\u2019s property hot spots of Greater Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley, Iskandar Malaysia, Johor Baru, Penang and Sabah,\\u201d says Leong. Of the 47 projects, nine are completed while seven are in the early stage. This means cash flow demands on the group are relatively low, Leong points out. \\u201cThe group had a low net gearing of 0.16 times in 2013 despite the growth in the number of projects, comfortably below our optimal net gearing target of 0.5 times.\\u201d Mah Sing\\u2019s net gearing had dropped from 0.26 times in 2012, 0.29 times in 2011 and 0.21 times in 2010. \\u201cBased on our strong net gearing ratio and cash pile and backed by our shareholders\\u2019 funds of RM1.95 billion, Mah Sing has a potential war chest of close to RM1.5 billion for landbanking,\\u201d says Leong. Analysts echo his sentiment, saying that Mah Sing still has the financial strength to maintain its aggressive landbanking efforts.  Property is a cyclical industry; we always react differently, depending on the property cycle \\u2014 Leong\\u201cMah Sing still has a lot of capacity to acquire as it has over RM800 million in cash and normally, there is laggard payment on the properties it acquires,\\u201d says CIMB Research property analyst Terence Wong. For instance, in its latest land purchase in the SSAAS Golf Course, only 10% of the RM327.5 million price will be settled upon the execution of the sale and purchase agreement (SPA) with the remaining 90% to be paid within 30 months of the SPA. \\u201cI think Mah Sing will continue with its aggressive landbanking efforts and quick turnaround model. Companies such as Mah Sing have no choice because they don\\u2019t have much land,\\u201d says Wong. \\u201cBut it does seem to be shifting towards a more asset-heavy model, like S P Setia Bhd, in the sense that it is buying bigger land, which can be spread across many years. In this way, it doesn\\u2019t need to chase after land so much.\\u201d About 83% of analysts covering the Mah Sing stock have \\u201cbuy\\u201d calls on it while the remaining 17% have \\u201chold\\u201d recommendations. The consensus target price is RM2.73, giving it an upside potential of 25.8% on last Wednesday\\u2019s closing price of RM2.17, which puts the company\\u2019s market capitalisation at RM3.1 billion. For the year ended Dec 31, 2013, Mah Sing raked in RM2 billion in revenue, up from RM1.78 billion in the previous year. Net profit also grew, to RM280.62 million from RM230.62 million in 2012.

JTI announced to Bursa Malaysia yesterday that it had received a conditional takeover offer from JT International Holding BV (JTIH), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Japan Tobacco Inc, to acquire the remaining 39.63% stake or 103.6 million shares it does not already own in JTI. JTIH, which has an issued and paid-up capital of US$1.8 billion (RM5.88 billion), currently holds 157.9 million shares, representing approximately 60.37% of the issued and share capital of JTI. In making the offer, it does not intend to maintain the listing status of JTI. Other major shareholders of JTI include the Employees Provident Fund (8.13%) and Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (6.84%). Analysts viewed the offer price of RM7.80 per share as attractive, considering JTI\\u2019s thin trading volume and the fact that the company is operating in an already matured industry faced with constant challenges. In the notice of the conditional takeover offer, CIMB Investment Bank, which advises JTIH, stated that the offer price of RM7.80 represents more than five times JTI\\u2019s audited and announced unaudited net assets per share of RM1.35\\u00a0and RM1.37 respectively, as at Dec 31, 2012 and 2013. The offer price also represents a premium of between 20% and 23.8% to the price and [5-days to 1-year] volume-weighted average market prices of JTI shares up to and including March 27. \\u201cThe premium offered provides a good opportunity for shareholders to exit. With a thin trading volume, it is hard for investors to get out,\\u201d said an analyst with UOB Kay Hian Research. Based on Bloomberg data, JTI had an average trading volume of only 41,986 shares per day, for the past 90 days. Compared with its total issued share base of 261.5 million, trading had been negligible. It is also worth noting that JTI shares have not traded at or above the offer price for the past 15 years. \\u201cIt is a good offer, at a time where the consumption outlook is becoming more challenging in Malaysia, and with the tobacco industry volume expected to contract by 15% this year,\\u201d the analyst noted. \\u201cThe tobacco industry is a very mature industry, how much more can you grow? Taking it private is a good thing,\\u201d said another analyst who tracks the stock. He noted constant challenges such as excise duty hikes, which have resulted in the sharp increases in cigarette prices over the years, and that the growing presence of illicit cigarettes have made the industry tougher. \\u201cIt is also a matter where the parent has spotted value,\\u201d said the UOB analyst, stating that with an offer price of RM7.80, it translates to a price-earnings ratio (PER) of about 13x [based on its earnings forecast], which is at a sharp discount to its much bigger rival, British American Tobacco Malaysia Bhd (BAT) that is valued at 20x PER. But he noted that BAT has always commanded a sharper premium to JTI, due to its much larger market capitalisation of almost RM17 billion, that is eight to nine times JTI\\u2019s and a dominant market share.

This was stressed by several research houses today, including JF Apex Securities. At 3.16pm, Gamuda slipped 3 sen or 0.65 per cent sen RM4.61 after falling to a low of RN4.60 in morning trades, although yesterday it reported a stronger performance for the second financial quarter. The stock saw trades of some 1.9 million shares. JF said it was not ruling out the possibility of the WASIA being invoked as the dispute over the Selangor water asset restructuring exercise intensified. WASIA allows for a compulsory takeover of the water assets in the state by the government in the name of national interest. JF Apex\\u2019s research analyst Soong Wei Siang said: \\u201cThe risk of the invocation of WASIA and the potential divestment loss of RM920 million could dampen sentiment on the stock.\\u201d \\u201cWe expect the deadlock and dispute to drag further as the group will contest the decision, if the WASIA is to be invoked.\\u201d Due to the WASIA factor, Soong is maintaining his \\u2018hold\\u2019 call on the stock, with an unchanged \\u2018limited upside\\u2019 target price (TP) of RM4.73.

This is arrived at after factoring in the RM920 million divestment loss and the state\\u2019s valuation for Syarikat Pengeluar Air Sungai Selangor Sdn Bhd (Splash). However, Sharizan said the possibility of a forced takeover scenario seemed \\u2018far-fetched\\u2019.

Last week, shipping sources said Bumi Armada had purchased Independent Tankers Corp\\u2019s (ITC) 309,995 deadweight tonne Ulysses (formerly known as Phoenix Voyager) for just below US$25 million. ITC had announced the sale of the vessel to the Norwegian bourse \\u2014 where the company is publicly traded \\u2014 but did not name the buyer. \\u00a0 \\u201cBumi Armada has acquired the tanker for conversion into an FPSO. You only acquire and convert a tanker when you have locked in a charter \\u2026 hence, the speculation that the company has won the Angola contract,\\u201d an industry player explains.  A Bumi Armada official whom The Edge spoke to was tight-lipped when contacted and neither confirmed nor denied the speculation. Since January this year, Bumi Armada has been neck and neck with Italian oil and gas contractor Saipem SpA for the Angola contract from Italian company Eni SpA. Interestingly enough, Eni is Saipem\\u2019s parent company, controlling 43% of its shares. The FPSO job in Angola would mark Bumi Armada\\u2019s first such contract in the West African country and its eighth in total. In January this year, Bumi Armada won its maiden deal in Angola \\u2014 albeit for offshore support \\u2014 when it secured jobs for two platform support vessels worth US$16 million (RM52.6 million). The charter is for one year with four options of six months each at an aggregate value of US$32 million if the options are fully exercised by charterer Interoil Angola Limitada. Analysts who cover Bumi Armada say an announcement pertaining to the FPSO contract in Angola is likely to be made by the end of the first quarter of this year. If Bumi Armada does win the Angola FPSO contract, it will be its largest to date. The contract is also likely to have a significant impact on the company\\u2019s bottom line because it will bump up the existing order book of RM13.2 billion by about 38%. Better Numbers For FY2013 ended Dec 31, Bumi Armada registered a net profit of RM431.2 million on the back of almost RM2.1 billion in revenue while earnings per share (EPS) was 14.7 sen.  In contrast to FY2012, net profit in the year just ended was up 11.8% while revenue was 24.7% higher. As at end-December last year, Bumi Armada had cash and bank balances of RM634.5 million while on the other side of the balance sheet, it had short-term borrowings of RM1.2 billion and long-term debt commitments of RM2.6 billion.  CIMB, in a report released in February this year, puts Bumi Armada\\u2019s net profit in FY2014 at RM659.8 million from RM2.6 billion in revenue, which works out to an EPS of about 23 sen. The bank-backed research house has an \\u201cadd\\u201d call on Bumi Armada (which is equivalent to a \\u201cbuy\\u201d) and pegged its target price at RM5.17, which was at a 33% premium to the stock\\u2019s closing price of RM3.89 last Friday.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The substantially higher earnings forecast for FY2014 could be from the Angola FPSO and a long-delayed FPSO contract from Husky Energy in Madura, Indonesia, which Bumi Armada has been touted to win for some time now. While divulging very little, Bumi Armada\\u2019s officials have stated that they are bidding for 12 FPSO contracts largely in Asia, Africa and South America this year.  Last year, the company bid for 12 FPSO jobs as well and secured two \\u2014 Oil and Natural Gas Corp of India\\u2019s C7 in February and the US$1.4 billion Kraken FPSO contract from EnQuest plc in December. With seven contracts under its wing currently, Bumi Armada is the fifth largest FPSO player in the world. It is controlled by billionaire tycoon T Ananda Krishnan with 42.3% equity interest.

With him are (from left) Lim, Ho, Lewis and Song. THE global economy is set to recover in the light of improving growth in the US and Europe. But what Malaysia accomplishes will depend on how developed economies perform, external demand and government policies, say panellists at The Edge Economic Forum 2014\\u00a0 that was held in Kuala Lumpur on March 8. The speakers at the forum were Song Seng Wun, regional economist at CIMB Research Pte Ltd, Singapore; Geoff Lewis, executive director and global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, Hong Kong; Lim Suet Ling, CEO of UOB Asset Management (M) Bhd; and Datuk Tong Kooi Ong, executive chairman of The Edge Media Group.  The moderator of the forum was Ho Kay Tat, publisher and CEO of The Edge Media Group. \\u201cThis is a year of recovery for the global economy, which is usually good for risk assets,\\u201d observes Lewis. \\u201cIf America is doing well, it\\u2019s hard to drag down. Europe has a lot of structural problems, but its economy is enjoying a cyclical recovery. Most German banks are forecasting 1% [gross domestic product] growth in the eurozone, but it could be 1.5%. Germany might even exceed 2% this year.\\u201d Song echoes his sentiment, pointing to Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) readings, which are higher in Europe than in Asean. The PMI indicates the economic health of the manufacturing sector based on five indicators: new orders, inventory levels, production, supplier deliveries and the employment environment. A PMI reading of more than 50 represents an expansion in the manufacturing sector month on month while a reading of below 50 represents a contraction. A reading of 50 indicates no change. The eurozone\\u2019s PMI reading for January was close to 55 while for Asia ex-Japan, it was below 50. \\u201cThe first quarter of this year could have been quieter because of Chinese New Year and things could pick up in 2Q2014. Europe seems busier, but it is coming from a period when its economy was in a steep recession,\\u201d says Song.  \\u201cAsian exports have to pick up pace, without which the markets here will lag behind. Asean member states have a fairly large dependency [on external demand], including Malaysia, whose key markets are the US and Europe.\\u201d The PMI indicates the direction the economy is taking, explains Song. If it is supportive of factory activities, it should translate into stronger export numbers. \\u201cI look at cargo figures and machine imports are a healthy sign of how things are.\\u201d Apart from being optimistic about the US and European markets, Lewis and Song are also bullish on Japan, although Lewis has reservations about China.  \\u201cWe had the first boost from Abenomics early last year \\u2014 amazing growth rates of over 4% \\u2014 but it didn\\u2019t last. But we don\\u2019t underestimate [Japan\\u2019s ability] to keep growing; more policy easing will keep growth up in the short term,\\u201d opines Lewis.  \\u201cThere is doubt about China \\u2014 we have concerns about its quality of growth. It might be sacrificing a bit of growth as it cleans house. Most forecasts I see are between 7.25% and 8%. We anticipate 7%, slightly below the official target.\\u201d  As for developing markets, the forecasts are promising and could provide investing opportunities in selected economies. The unrest in Venezuela and Ukraine, Turkey facing market discipline or India\\u2019s tightening measures should not pose a threat to the global economy, says Lewis. \\u201cIf some are expecting 3.75% world growth, we\\u2019d take 0.4% off due to [the risks in] emerging markets, bringing it down to 3.3%.\\u201d  Still, investors should not sell their emerging market holdings just yet as several African countries were not as affected by recession. \\u201cGhana and Mozambique [grew] 4.5% and over 5%, Tanzania and Africa [overall] are doing quite well and there are a few African emerging market funds. Cambodia shows strong growth and Indonesia didn\\u2019t really suffer from a recession,\\u201d Lewis points out.  \\u201cThese are viewed by our fund managers as a great bottom-up opportunity. China is at a 25% price-to-book discount and emerging market equities as a group have a price-to-book [value] of below 1.5. Historically, this has been a good time for an investor with a longer-term horizon of two to three years.\\u201d Developing markets may hold promise, but there are still gains to be made in the US and developed markets. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re going to go \\u2018overweight\\u2019 on developed markets, \\u2018overweight\\u2019 Europe. That\\u2019s where cyclical momentum is the best and profits are operationally geared to that,\\u201d Lewis says. \\u201cThis is also a good time to go back to Japan. There\\u2019s very little optimism now about Abenomics, but don\\u2019t underestimate Japan. It\\u2019s the only developed economy where both the fiscal and monetary authorities are full-on in terms of policy easing. That will probably drive the yen down, which will be reflected in earnings.\\u201d Will an improving US market and the Federal Reserve\\u2019s tapering of its quantitative easing (QE) programme lead to volatility? Not according to Lewis, who states that interest rates should be kept low until 2015.  \\u201cI don\\u2019t see the market\\u2019s upset as being the result of tapering; it was more Latin American fears: Venezuela\\u2019s 80% credit growth, running out of reserves and signs of hyperinflation, and Argentina trying to negotiate itself out of the last debt blowout.\\u201d After presentations by Song and Lewis, Lim and Tong articulated their views on the Malaysian market.The stock market  Participants listening attentively \\u00a0Lim projects a 5% to 5.5% GDP growth for Malaysia this year, reiterating that global growth, domestic growth powered by the Economic Transformation Programme and a recovery in exports are crucial for the country. The electrical and electronics industry, in particular, controls a substantial portion of Malaysia\\u2019s export numbers.  Although inflation, debt and foreign holdings in our local market may shadow the outlook for Malaysia, Lim thinks the situation is not too bleak.  \\u201cMalaysian household debt as a percentage of GDP has been growing since mid-2000. At 85%, it is the second highest after South Korea at above 90%,\\u201d she points out. \\u201cThe good thing is that Malaysian household assets [as a percentage] of GDP are also good, more than 100%. The assets comprise deposits, investments in the market and unit trusts and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) savings.\\u201d Malaysian government debt levels too are increasing, but the expected implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) next year should keep its fiscal deficit of over 4% in check.  The new tax system, however, will contribute to inflation, along with last year\\u2019s food and petrol subsidy cuts, causing higher Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers in the next six months, according to Lim, who sees inflation at 3.1% to 3.5%. \\u201cThe current view is that Bank Negara Malaysia is monitoring the [CPI] numbers before deciding to hike the overnight policy rate. There is still the possibility of a slight hike in the second half of this year,\\u201d she says. \\u201cBut fiscal consolidation is something our government needs to push through; the short-term pain of GST is a long-term gain.\\u201d When it comes to Malaysia\\u2019s foreign bond holdings, Lim says roughly 44% of government securities are held by foreigners, up from around 25% in 2006. The risk lies in a weakening ringgit if bonds continue to sell.  \\u201cWe\\u2019re less worried about the stock market because foreign holdings there are low,\\u201d she says, adding that the highest percentage of foreign holdings was 27% in 2007. This has dipped to roughly 24% now. As the US recovers and tapering continues, Lim expects volatility and continued capital outflow from emerging to developed markets. While there will be withdrawals from our market, the impact will be muted, she opines. \\u201cWhen we first heard of QE reductions last May, the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand bore the brunt of the impact. Their yields went up, indicating a withdrawal. The Malaysian market was pretty flat as foreigners aren\\u2019t as heavy in our market. We should be fine in the light of the US recovery as we are above the Asian average of 0.8%, that is we are positively leveraged to the US, better than Indonesia or India.\\u201d Tong, on the other hand, is less optimistic about Malaysia due to potential outflow. \\u201cAs the US prints less money and money flows out, what happens to Malaysia\\u2019s market will depend on externalities and on how the government manages the country going forward,\\u201d he explains.  \\u201cExternalities depend on how fast US interest rates go up, the health of the Chinese economy and its banking system. They also determine how much time the country has to address capital outflows.\\u201d Increasing fiscal revenue to reduce deficit is a way for Malaysia to manage capital outflows. However, the implementation of measures such as GST is easier said than done. \\u201cPolitically, they will be difficult to implement and require a lot of political commitment, which is also hard in an environment where we are politically polarised,\\u201d opines Tong. \\u201cAlready, real interest rates have gone negative; interest rates in Malaysia must rise, but the government and households are already in deep debt.\\u201d He points out that much of Malaysia\\u2019s debt is owed to locals rather than foreigners, which makes the current situation less risky than that in the 1990s. Hence, capital outflows are also likely to be triggered by local investors.  \\u201cThose of you in this room are as likely to trigger a capital outflow as foreigners, depending on your outlook of the ringgit. If Malaysians begin to lose faith, there is no amount of money in the EPF or any other institution that is going to stem the tide.\\u201d Since Malaysia is heavily dependent on oil and gas in terms of federal revenue and exports, Tong notes that the industry is one to watch. \\u201cOil production is rising either because of shale gas and oil or the application of fracking technology. The Alaskan gas pipeline and tar sands in Canada have implications for the future of oil prices, if that is true,\\u201d he says.  \\u201cIf oil prices are negatively impacted, then there must be implications for Malaysia and, to some extent, the oil and gas industry, which is driving Malaysia\\u2019s growth.\\u201d This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on March 17, 2014."}, "92": {"date_posted": "21/3/2014", "title": "Stock Focus: Slower sales and challenges seen for SP Setia in FY14", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Mar 21): Analysts now forecast slower sales for SP Setia Bhd in FY14 due to a sharp cut in\\u00a0 sales target by the property company and comments made at a meeting yesterday.

But even at RM5 billion, we are still the biggest property developer in Malaysia,\\u201d said Liew after the group\\u2019s annual and extraordinary general meetings yesterday. Liew said SP Setia\\u2019s unbilled sales of RM9.64 billion would be able to sustain the group\\u2019s earnings for the next three to four years. In a note today, CIMB Investment Bank remarked that although sales of SP Setia were strong in 1QFY14, sales could be slowing down for the remaining quarters as February sales only amounted to RM200 million. \\u201cWe believe the slowing sales could be partly due to the imminent departure of CEO Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin, who resigned in January,\\u201d CIMB said while noting its CFO Datuk Teow Leong Seng also resigned at the same time. Teow was initially slated to take over as deputy president of SP Setia after Liew\\u2019s departure, but instead both will be leaving the company by the end of April. \\u201cWe believe FY13\\u2019s record new sales of RM8.24 billion is unlikely to be surpassed this year,\\u201d said the research house. CIMB has maintained its \\u201chold\\u201d rating on SP Setia at RM2.95, with a target price (TP) of RM3.09. HwangDBS Vickers Research forecasts \\u201cmore challenges ahead\\u201d for SP Setia due to dampened demand for high-end properties, rising raw material costs and shortage of foreign skilled labour. \\u201cSP Setia\\u2019s strong following and rising exposure to overseas projects should help cushion some of the impact, but we are skeptical it can beat its record RM8.2 billion sales in FY13 given lesser overseas launches,\\u201d said the research house.

Dorab Mistry, renowned analyst and director of Godrej International Ltd, believes that if an El Ni\\u00f1o does develop, crude palm oil (CPO) prices could skyrocket to RM3,500 per tonne by late this year. Last Thursday, the three-month CPO futures contract closed at RM2,845. The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, the official journal of the United States National Academy of Sciences, says there is a 76% chance of an El Ni\\u00f1o occurring later this year. This weather pattern typically lasts 9 to 12 months and parches much of Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. Should this happen, plantation companies will gain from higher CPO prices. However, the benefits for those with young palms reaching maturity are expected to be even bigger as this group of companies could ride production growth as well as higher average selling prices. \\u201cThe risk of lower fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production due to hot weather can be offset by young palms,\\u201d says PublicInvest Research analyst Chong Hoe Leong. \\u201cUsually, planters have only one option \\u2014 CPO price or production. The biggest winners will, of course, be those planters with strong FFB production growth, palms with a young age profile and location in unaffected areas.\\u201d He adds that big market capitalisation companies with palms in their prime, such as Sime Darby Bhd, Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd and IOI Corp, will enjoy higher CPO prices, but they will also suffer declining production. \\u201cIf higher prices are due to lower supply, planters may lose out because a 50% rise in CPO prices will not offset the earnings impact of a 50% drop in output,\\u201d cautions CIMB Research plantation analyst Saw Xiao Jun. One cannot be certain how much of the possibility of an El Ni\\u00f1o the market has factored into current CPO prices, Saw adds. \\u201cIt seems that the market has turned from underweighting bad weather to overweighting it.\\u201d In just over a month, CPO futures have risen 13% and closed at RM2,845 per tonne last Thursday. By Mistry\\u2019s estimates, CPO prices could go up to RM3,000 per tonne by June if weather conditions improve. If rains return to normal, the prices will range from RM2,600 to RM2,900 from July to October, he forecast at the Palm and Lauric Oils Conference last Wednesday. \\u201cIn the event that an El Ni\\u00f1o develops, I believe CPO futures will cling to RM3,000 beyond June [2014],\\u201d he said. Without unusual weather conditions, however, there is limited upside potential for CPO prices, said Thomas Mielke, executive director of ISTA Mielke GmbH Oil World. \\u201cCPO prices in Rotterdam could touch or slightly exceed US$1,000 in the next four to eight weeks,\\u201d he said at the same conference. He expects CPO prices to average US$970 this year. Without unusual weather conditions, there is limited upside potential for CPO prices But to an analyst with a local bank-backed research house, the pertinent question is, how certain are we of an impending El Ni\\u00f1o, and if there is one, how long will it last? \\u201cWhat we are looking at is not an immediate impact, but rather a laggard impact on output in 9 to 12 months. For planters with palms with a young age profile, there should be less disruption to total production,\\u201d she says. The problem for investors is that, overall, the sector has seen valuations creep up in recent months. But some fund managers have noticed that the valuations of the smaller planters are relatively cheaper than those of the big boys.When looking at Malaysia-listed plantation companies with palms with a young age profile, the names that crop up include Ta Ann Holdings Bhd, Sarawak Oil Palms Bhd (SOP), TSH Resources Bhd, TH Plantations Bhd (THP), TDM Bhd, Kretam Holdings Bhd, IJM Plantations Bhd (IJMP), Jaya Tiasa Holdings Bhd and Genting Plantations Bhd (see Table 1). Of these, Ta Ann, SOP and THP are based in Sarawak and recently hogged the limelight for the wrong reasons. Wilmar International Ltd recently made known its new \\u201cno peat, no deforestation, no exploitation\\u201d policy, which means it will stop buying CPO from oil palm companies that plant on peat swampland from 2016 onwards. It is unclear how this will impact the market in Sarawak, but so far, Ta Ann has said it will complete its peat plantings by the Dec 31, 2015, deadline.SOP, on the other hand, has its own refining capacity and is unaffected by Wilmar\\u2019s policy. Ta Ann seems to be the favourite of analysts, who say the stock is \\u201cstill cheap\\u201d at current prices. It is trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of under 14 times, lower than that for other companies with young palms (see Table 2). About 9,000ha or 26% of Ta Ann\\u2019s planted hectarage comprises young and immature palms. The company has been on an upward trend, raking in a net profit of RM92.06 million in FY2013 ended Dec 31 compared with RM57.46 million the year before (see Table 3). Besides Ta Ann, analysts also like Genting Plantations and TSH as all three are pure upstream planters and have double-digit FFB production growth. TSH has among the youngest palms on the market with 76% of its land planted with immature trees, but its stock is getting pricey, say analysts. Genting Plantations too has immature trees \\u2014 on 42% of its landbank. It posted a net profit of RM227.8 million in FY2013 while TSH made RM153.1 million, up from RM77.03 million in FY2012.

The index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (May 2013) and it represented an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cFlat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cPseudo-Bull\\u201d rise completed. The index price movement in the next few months following May 2013 was trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low) and 1,838.69 (high). The index\\u2019s daily signals (like CCI, DMI, MACD and Stochastic) are mainly negative except the Oscillator. As such, the index\\u2019s weaker support levels are seen at 1,769, 1,799 and 1,813, while the resistance areas of 1,818, 1,839 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some very heavy selling activities. Our rebound retracement target of 1,839.26 (62% level) capped the index on March 6. As the index could not penetrate above this key level, it has thrown the KLCI\\u2019s onus to the downside, with critical supports of 1,813 and 1,800 in focus again. Its simple moving averages (MA) depict a neutral trend for its daily and weekly charts. Due to its weaker chart signals, we believe investors will adopt a \\u201ctake profit on rallies\\u201d philosophy for the KLCI. Due to the softer tone for the KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201csell\\u201d on Malaysia Airport Holdings Bhd (MAHB), which announced that it has not received the certificate of completion and compliance (CCC) for klia2, which was due on Jan 31. A delay in the May 2 opening of klia2 looks imminent, given that the operational readiness and airport transfer (ORAT) normally takes three to six months to complete post the issuance of the CCC. klia2 is set to be MAHB\\u2019s biggest earnings driver for the year and much optimism on the stock is premised on the project being on track. It is now uncertain when klia2 will be ready for operations and our analyst doubts that the RM4 billion capital expenditure budget is on target. Our Maybank IB analyst has downgraded MAHB to \\u201csell\\u201d with a target price of RM7.03 based on a 2014 price-earnings ratio (PER) of 20.5 times bringing near-term valuations more in line with its peers. A check on Bloomberg consensus reveals 18 brokers covering the stock. Of the 18 research houses that cover the stock, five have a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call, seven \\u201csell\\u201d and six \\u201chold\\u201d.\\u00a0\\u00a0 The stock is currently trading at a high historical PER of 25.1 times and a high price-to-book value of 2.11 times. MAHB\\u2019s price trends on the daily chart are weaker. Its share price made an obvious decline since its daily Wave-5 and all-time high of RM9.78 in December 2013. Since that RM9.78 high, MAHB declined to its recent February 2014 low of RM7.87. Its chart has moved into an obvious daily downtrend to its recent February 2014 low of RM7.87. As it broke below its recent key critical support levels of RM9.43 and RM8.62, look to \\u201csell\\u201d MAHB on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to medium term downtrends for this stock. The daily indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD, Oscillator and Stochastic) are very negative and now depict the obvious indications of MAHB\\u2019s eventual move towards much lower levels. We expect MAHB to remain weaker towards its support levels of RM6.90, RM7.87 and RM7.90. It will attract heavy liquidation at the resistance levels of RM8.08, RM8.62 and RM9.78. Its downside retracement targets are now located at RM7.76, RM6.74 and RM6.51. Lee Cheng Hooi is the regional chartist at Maybank Kim Eng.

Yesterday, Selangor Menteri Besar Tan Sri Khalid Ibrahim told the media that the state government would only pay RM7.65 billion for the water assets, instead of an earlier offer of RM9.65 billion.

The index closed at 1,831.66 yesterday, up 9.11 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks such as CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, IOI Corp Bhd, Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd and PPB Group Bhd caused the index to rise. The index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (May 2013) and it represented an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cFlat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cPseudo-Bull\\u201d rise completed. The index price movements in the next few months following May 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high) and 1,769.80 (low). The index\\u2019s daily signals (CCI, DMI, MACD and Oscillator) are mainly positive except its Stochastic. As such, the index\\u2019s obvious support levels are seen at the 1,769, 1,799 and 1,831 levels, while the resistance areas of 1,833, 1,839 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some very heavy profit taking.  Our rebound retracement target of 1,839.26 (62% level) may cap the index in the short to medium term. The index must penetrate this key level with high volumes to be certain of an eventual test of the 1,882.20 high again. Its simple moving averages (MA) depict a triple timeframe for its daily, weekly and monthly chart. Due to its firmer chart signals, we believe investors may adopt a \\u201cNibble on Dips\\u201d philosophy for the KLCI.  Due to the uncertain tone of the KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201csell\\u201d on Pos Malaysia Bhd. It fell on strong selling on Feb 20 backed by high volumes suggesting an overly pessimistic view of its results for the third quarter ended Dec 31, 2013 of financial year 2014 (3QFY14). Its 3Q pre-tax profit was 19.3% lower at RM33.8 million.  Looking at the current reported shareholding changes on Bloomberg, we observe that the Employees Provident Fund and Aberdeen Asset (which hold 11.05% and 9.31% respectively) reduced their stakes this month and this could have led to the huge price decline. A check on Bloomberg consensus indicates that five research house have coverage on the stock. Only one of them has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the stock, while the remaining four have a \\u201chold\\u201d call. The stock is currently trading at a historical price-earnings ratio of 18 times and a high price-to-book value of 2.6 times. Pos Malaysia\\u2019s chart trends on the daily and weekly timeframes are very weak. Its share price made an obvious decline since its weekly Wave-5 high of RM6.05 last November. Since that RM6.05 high, Pos Malaysia fell to its recent February low of RM4.32. Its chart has moved into very strong daily and weekly downtrends to its recent February low of RM4.32. As it broke above its recent key critical support levels of RM5.31 and RM5.23, look to sell Pos Malaysia on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to medium term downtrends for this stock.  The daily and weekly indicators (such as the CCI, DMI, Oscillator and MACD) are very negative and now depict the obvious indications of Pos Malaysia\\u2019s eventual decline towards much lower levels.  We expect Pos Malaysia to remain very weak towards its support levels of RM3.94, RM4.32 and RM4.49. It will attract major selling and liquidation activities at the resistance levels of RM4.71, RM5.23 and RM6.05.

In FY13, the revenue from the TI segment (including inter-segment revenue) accounted for only 22.8% of the group\\u2019s top line. However, it was the biggest contributor to net profit, at 60.5%. This was mainly due to its high pre-tax profit margin of 52.7% compared to 9.6% for the non-life unit in Malaysia, which was weighed down by a high claims ratio. The earnings contribution from TI will continue to rise because of its swift premium expansion and lucrative margins. For exposure to the fast growing and high margin travel insurance segment, there is no better choice than Tune Ins. Its strengths lie in the tie-up with AirAsia Bhd and its expertise in this area, which will not be easily replicated by its competitors.

The group\\u2019s total loan impairment doubled to RM660 million in FY13, from RM329 million in the previous year. CIMB Group chief executive Datuk Seri Nazir Razak (pic) said the amount was due to an uptick in provisioning in CIMB Thai, significantly lower recoveries and write-backs. The sharp rise in loan impairment was partly due to some write-backs as a result of accounting adjustments in the previous corresponding quarter that had pulled down the provision then. Meanwhile, there was an increase in the provision for 4QFY13 because of more prudent provision policy. In an announcement to Bursa Malaysia, the banking group said it had decided to abort the proposed listing on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in light of the market conditions in Thailand. Nonetheless, FY13 turned out to be a record profit year, despite higher provision due to prudent provision policy. The group achieved a record high net profit of RM4.54 billion for FY13, up 4.5% from RM4.34 billion in FY12. Revenue rose to RM14.67 billion, or 8.7% higher from RM13.49 billion in FY12.

Its market cap now stands at RM4.34 billion. Yesterday\\u2019s closing price works out to a 16.13% fall in the airline\\u2019s share price since Feb 18 when it announced a net loss of RM343.43 million for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31 of financial year 2013 (4QFY13), its largest in the past 10 quarters. For the full FY13, the group posted a net loss of RM1.17 billion, up 170% from the previous year\\u2019s net loss of RM432.6 million. For MAS\\u2019 largest shareholder, Khazanah Nasional Bhd, which has a 69.37% stake in the airline, the share price fall translates to a paper loss of RM581.7 billion. The second largest shareholder is the Employees\\u2019 Provident Fund with a 1.04% stake.

MAS\\u2019 losses had increased despite the fact that it managed to fly more flights and passengers, while filling more seats. The airline\\u2019s average seat kilometres (ASK) and revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) for FY13 grew by 17% and 27% respectively from the previous year. Load factors rose from 74.7% to a commendable 81%. The airline, however, saw its costs for FY13 growing much quicker. The losses were pinned on higher fuel costs as the ringgit weakened by 4.7% year-on-year to 3.21 in the fourth quarter even as oil prices fell by 3.7% in the same period to US$129 (RM423) per barrel, noted CIMB Research in a report last week.  The ringgit\\u2019s weak outlook does not bode well for MAS either. As at yesterday, the ringgit had weakened further to 3.2802 against the greenback. In addition, MAS will have to contend with increased competition both domestically and internationally. \\u201cOur survey of announced capacity schedules up to July 2014 indicates that MAS (and AirAsia X Bhd) is struggling to digest a huge expansion of capacity to Australia in late 2013/early 2014, while Malindo Air is launching new routes to India and Thailand, competing directly with MAS. \\u201cHence, fierce domestic competition in 2013 is now spreading internationally in 2014,\\u201d said CIMB Research.

At 10.15am, the bourse's most-active stock was traded at 29.5 sen with some 62 million shares done. Yesterday, MAS reported a net loss of RM343.44 million in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2013 (4QFY13) compared to a net profit of RM51.37 million a year earlier.

Furthermore, Malaysia\\u2019s gross domestic product grew 5.1% in the last quarter of 2013, beating market expectations. This provided some boost to market confidence. However, the Malaysian economy grew by 4.7% for the whole of 2013, compared with 5.6% in 2012. The KLCI remained almost firm from last week at 1,825.24 points after trading between 1,813.90 and 1,833.39 points. The close at the middle of the trading range indicates market uncertainty. Average daily trading volume for the past one week was higher at 2.9 billion shares, compared with 1.8 billion shares two weeks ago. However,\\u00a0 the average trading value was RM2.2 billion indicating that penny stocks were the focus. Last week, net sellers in Bursa Malaysia continued to be foreign institutions at RM760.2 million and another RM40.4 million from local retail. Net buyers were local institutions. In the KLCI, gainers equalled decliners. The gainers were led by MISC Bhd (+4.4%), Tenaga Nasional Bhd (+3%) and IHH Healthcare Bhd (+2.7%) while decliners were led by SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd (-3.1%), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (-1.8%) and AMMB Holdings Bhd (-1.8%).

US and European shares continued to increase last week but the markets are expected to be cautious on subdued US economic data that caused the US dollar to slump to a three-week low against the euro. The US Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 2.2% in a week to 16,154.39 points last Friday. The market was closed on Monday for a public holiday. London\\u2019s FTSE100 Index increased 2.2% in a week to 6,736.00 points while German\\u2019s DAX Index jumped 3.9% to 9,656.6 points. Commodity prices were bullish on a weak US dollar as investors are now hedging against the greenback and equity markets uncertainty. Commodity Exchange gold rose 2.3% in a week to US$1,320.30 (RM4,343) an ounce. New York Mercantile Exchange crude oil closed marginally higher in a week at US$100.34 per barrel. The US dollar index declined to 80.24 points from 80.73 points in the previous week, the lowest level in slightly more than a month. The ringgit slightly strengthened against the US dollar from 3.33 to 3.30. Crude palm oil futures rallied on a bullish trend, increasing 3.9% in a week to RM2,714 per tonne. The KLCI is in a bullish mode after climbing above the short term 30-day moving average last week and managed to stay above this level despite the whipsaw in the past week. It is still early to say whether the KLCI correction is over and the bullish trend may continue. The index has so far retraced 50% from the downward correction since early January. The 61% Fibonacci retracement level is at 1,839 points and the KLCI may still remain bearish if it stays under this level. Furthermore, the KLCI is still below the Ichimoku Cloud which currently ranges between 1,830 and 1,850 points. Momentum indicators like the RSI continued to increase after climbing above its middle level last week and this signals that the momentum has turned bullish. The MACD has also crossed above its trigger line or nine-day moving average early last week. The index has climbed above the mid-band of the Bollinger Bands but not near the top band of this indicator. This indicates that the bullish momentum is still weak. We are probably going to see a cautious market this week and although the KLCI momentum is bullish, it may struggle to climb higher. Higher commodity prices show that the market has shifted its focus from the equity markets. Locally, foreign institutions have been net sellers for a few months now and there are no indications of\\u00a0 slowing down. This would also dampen market confidence. Henceforth, I am expecting the KLCI to trade sideways between 1,808 and 1,835 points. Benny Lee is chief market strategist for Jupiter Securities Sdn Bhd.

This, along with strong order books, makes the sector far more attractive than the others, she says. \\u201cOf course, local O&G stocks are trading at a premium compared with their regional peers, but Malaysian funds are mandated to invest in local equities only. The limited pool of local O&G stocks has thus created very high demand for them with local funds more than willing to pay a premium for them.\\u201d In a Jan 23 note, HwangDBS Vickers Research attributes the premium of O&G stocks over others to their growth potential, backed by Petronas\\u2019 committed capex for the next few years and the clear earnings visibility of O&G companies that is buttressed by their record-high order books. As at Jan 23, Petronas had spent only RM76 billion of its RM300 billion budget for O&G jobs until 2015. In 2012, it spent RM45.6 billion, nearly 43% of which was channelled into the upstream sector. \\u201cContrary to market perception that Petronas\\u2019 spending has slowed, we believe the state-owned giant has never been busier, dishing out contracts to the industry. It awarded a slew of mega contracts in 2013, particularly the RM10 billion Pan Malaysia hook-up and commissioning job and the RM10 billion Pan Malaysia transport and installation job,\\u201d says HwangDBS. In the meantime, the upside potential of some O&G counters that have risen substantially has already been priced into them. For example, the shares of UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd (UMW-OG), which was listed just three months ago, rose 48.6% from the initial public offering price of RM2.80 to close at RM4.16 last Thursday.  According to Alliance Research, UMW-OG is the only O&G outfit under its coverage with a \\u201csell\\u201d recommendation. It says the stock\\u2019s valuation is much higher than that of big caps like SapuraKencana and Bumi Armada Bhd. \\u201cFurthermore, SapuraKencana and Bumi Armada have better earnings visibility and sizeable order books of RM28 billion and RM10.8 billion respectively, comprising long-term contracts of up to 10 years. On the other hand, UMW-OG has only secured long-term charters for two of its four drilling rigs and its order book is estimated at RM1.5 billion.\\u201d SapuraKencana continues to be the favourite of analysts. Apart from Alliance\\u2019s \\u201cstrong buy\\u201d recommendation, Bloomberg shows another 19 with a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the company and average 12-month target price of RM5.38, which implies an upside potential of 20.09%. The stock closed at RM4.48 last Thursday. Only Deleum Bhd had a higher implied upside potential \\u2014 20.47% \\u2014 among the local O&G stocks. Nevertheless, few analysts cover the O&G small cap. Eastspring\\u2019s Tan, meanwhile, believes the wide gap between SapuraKencana\\u2019s share price and analysts\\u2019 target price is due to the recent capital outflow from emerging markets, including Malaysia. \\u201cLocal funds supported the market strongly last month. But support is not as strong this month. Local funds have already crowded into O&G stocks and foreigners don\\u2019t seem ready to invest in the local market at this point,\\u201d she says.

We raise our target price to RM5 as we increase our financial year 2014 (FY14) and FY15 earnings per share (EPS) for higher charter rate assumptions for Naga 5, Naga 6, Naga 7 and Naga 8. We continue to value the stock at 22.5 times calendar year 2015 price-earnings ratio (PER), a 40% premium over our target market PER of 16.1 times, but still within the historical PER range of the oil and gas big caps. We expect consensus, which has taken a bearish view of UMW-OG\\u2019s fleet expansion, to catch up with us following the latest acquisition. We maintain our contrarian \\u201cadd\\u201d call, with the aggressive fleet expansion as a potential re-rating catalyst. UMW-OG announced on Feb 13 the acquisition of two jack-ups (Naga 6 and Naga 7) for US$217 million (RM722.61) each. Both jack-ups are under construction at China Merchants Heavy Industry\\u2019s yard in Shenzhen, for delivery in September this year for Naga 6 and December for Naga 7.

Naga 8, the acquisition of which was announced last week, is still without a contract but Naga 5 has been contracted to work for Nido Petroleum in the Philippines starting from June this year under a US$7 million six-week contract. The announcement was not a surprise. We have imputed an additional two jack-ups to be delivered this year, on top on Naga 5 which will be rolled out in May. We are thrilled management has delivered on its promise to add at least one jack-up per year. The acquisitions of Naga 6 and Naga 7 will be funded by a combination of internal funds and bank borrowings. UMW-OG still has around 60% of the RM1.7 billion initial public offering proceeds raised last year. We expect net gearing to remain manageable, at below one times in FY14/FY15. We raise our EPS forecasts by 2.7% for FY14 and 4.6% for FY15 as we increase our daily charter rate assumptions from US$150,000 to US$160,000 for Naga 5, Naga 6 and Naga 7, and to US$170,000 for Naga 8.

The SP500 index inched down 0.49 points to close at 1,819.26 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 30.83 points to end at 15,963.94. The FBMKLCI traded in a narrow range of 16.43 points for the week with volumes of 1.94 billion to 2.71 billion done. The index closed at 1,817.15 yesterday, down 8.49 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like BAT (M) Bhd, CIMB Group Bhd, KLK Bhd, Petronas Dagangan Bhd and PPB Group Bhd caused the index to decline yesterday. The index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (May 2013) and it represents an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cFlat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cPseudo-Bull\\u201d rise completed. The next few months\\u2019 index price movements since May 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low) and 1,882.20 (high). The index\\u2019s daily signals (CCI, DMI, MACD and Stochastic) are mainly positive except its Oscillator. As such, the index\\u2019s obvious support levels are seen at 1,769, 1,795 and 1,812 points, while the resistance areas of 1,818, 1,839 and all-time high of 1,882 points will witness some very heavy profit taking. Our rebound retracement targets of 1,826 (50% level) and 1,839.26 (62% level) may cap the index in the short to medium term. Therefore, the index could remain trapped with the broader ranges of 1,882 and 1,769 points for now. Its simple moving averages depict a mixed tone for its chart timeframes. Its daily chart has turned neutral, while the weekly and monthly charts appear buoyant for now. Due to its mixed chart signals, we believe investors may adopt a \\u201crange trading\\u201d philosophy for the FBMKLCI. Some rotational play into quality mid cap stocks may result. Due to the rebound tone of the FBMKLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Perdana Petroleum Bhd. Maybank-IB has an unchanged \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the stock with a revised target price for the stock of RM2.55 from RM1.90 following an 11% to 32% rise in its financial year 2013 (FY13) to FY15 earnings forecast. Our analyst expects this outperformance to be fuelled by higher utilisation and lower operating expenses. With an improved cash flow and balance sheet position,\\u00a0 Perdana is well-positioned to expand its fleet size. Our fundamental analyst thinks that the market has underestimated the stock but a strong fourth quarter FY13\\u00a0 result may spur investor optimism. A check on Bloomberg consensus reveals nine brokers cover the stock. Of these, seven have \\u201cbuy\\u201d ratings, one has a\\u00a0 \\u201csell\\u201d call and one has a \\u201chold\\u201d. The stock is currently trading at a lofty historical price-earnings ratio of 56.9 times and a very high price-to-book value of 2.6 times.  Perdana\\u2019s chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly timeframes are very strong indeed. Its share price made an obvious surge since its weekly Wave-4 low of RM1.19 in August 2013. Since that RM1.19 low, Perdana rose to its recent February 2014 high of RM1.96. Its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to its recent February 2014 high of RM1.96. As it broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of RM1.51 and RM1.75, look to buy Perdana on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to medium-term uptrends for this stock.  The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, Oscillator, MACD and Stochastic) are very strong and now depict the obvious indications of Perdana\\u2019s eventual rise towards much higher levels. We expect Perdana to remain very firm towards its support levels of RM1.51, RM1.75 and RM1.92. It will attract minor profit taking\\u00a0 at the resistance levels of RM1.98, RM2.08 and RM2.44. Its upside targets are now located at RM2.18, RM2.37, RM2.80 and RM3.12. Lee Cheng Hooi is the regional chartist at Maybank Kim Eng.

The market eventually rebounded last Wednesday and continued the momemtum until it closed at 1,821 points yesterday. This confirms the support level.

The close near the high of the trading range indicates good bullish momentum.

Yesterday, the index managed to climb above the short-term 30-day moving average at 1,820 points which could indicate an end to the bearish trend since early this year. However, the index is still below the Ichimoku Cloud indicator, indicating that the trend may still be bearish. Momentum indicators like the RSI rebounded last week and crossed above its middle levels. This simply indicates that the weak bearish momentum has turned bullish. Furthermore, the MACD indicator has also crossed above its trigger line or nine-day moving average. The KLCI has rebounded and closed above the mid-band of the Bollinger Bands indicator indicating that the bullish momentum is strengthening. All these indicators show that the KLCI has potential to climb higher. This week will be a crucial week to see if the market will continue to be supported. The support is likely going to come from local institutions as the foreign institution selling trend is still apparent. The KLCI support level will be at 1,800 points and the market may continue to stay bullish as long as it stays above this level.Now that the index has broken above the immediate resistance level at 1,820 points, the bullish momentum may continue with the index testing the next resistance level at 1,840 points, which is a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the downtrend since the beginning of this year.

JTI managing director Rob Stanworth said following the latest excise duty hike of 14%\\u00a0 in October last year which saw tobacco companies raising cigarette prices by RM1.50 per pack of 20 sticks, the tobacco industry saw a more than 10% drop in sales volume in the fourth quarter of last year and this is likely to drop even further this year. \\u201cI think we will see further contractions this year (as more smokers switch to buying illicit cigarettes which cost about half the price of legal ones). These events (increases in tobacco taxes) rarely moderate quickly,\\u201d Stanworth told The Edge Financial Daily in an interview. Research houses are forecasting total cigarette industry volume to decline by between 10% and 15% year-on-year in 2014. Despite the challenging operating environment, Stanworth said the group seeks to generate the same profit margin as it has over the years. For the nine months ended Sept 30, 2013 (9MFY13) and 9MFY12, its pre-tax profit margin stood at 13.4% and 13.1% respectively, while net margin stood at about 10%. In the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2013 (3QFY13), JTI reported a 7.7% decline in sales volume, causing its revenue to dip to RM307.3 million from RM319.2 million in the year-ago quarter. However, this was offset partially by higher cigarette prices in the quarter. Stanworth said the group can only conclude that the vast majority of consumers had simply moved to illegal cigarettes, which accounted for some 35% of the market. According to the Asia-11: Illicit Tobacco Indicator 2012 study by Oxford Economics, Malaysia has the third highest level of illicit tobacco use, after Brunei and Hong Kong.\\u201cAs such, our outlook for JTI and the overall industry depends very much on the [legal] market size rather than just the economic situation as Malaysia still has a stubbornly high illicit trade issue,\\u201d said Stanworth. SALES down... JTI managing director Rob Stanworth says the tobacco industry saw a more than 10% drop in sales volume in the fourth quarter of last Inflationary pressures have also led consumers to cut back on their spending, Stanworth said. He remains \\u201ccautiously optimistic\\u201d for sustained financial performance for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2014 (FY14). He explained that while the group is optimistic about its efforts to offer consumers more for their money with new product launches, it remains cautious as the size of the market and its development are not within its control. On its part, JTI will be intensifying its marketing efforts this year to maintain its competitiveness. \\u201cInvesting more in the product itself and marketing are two ways that we can try to win (market share) regardless of the prevailing economic and market environment,\\u201d Stanworth said. JTI recently launched Mevius Airstream, the first slide cigarette pack in the country, which includes a special filter that delivers smoke in a different way, thereby creating a different smoking experience. \\u201cThis launch is a clear example that we believe in investing in the product itself, thereby giving consumers something new and something more, and it is one of the key ways we can outperform in the market,\\u201d Stanworth said. He said response to the new product has been \\u201cexcellent\\u201d so far, adding that JTI may export the new \\u201cformat\\u201d to other Asian markets in the future. The slide packs are currently manufactured at JTI\\u2019s plant in Shah Alam, Selangor. \\u201cThere will always be something (new for consumers). We are always looking to do the most that we can for them,\\u201d Stanworth said, when asked if there will be other new product launches this year. Mevius, Salem and Camel fall under JTI\\u2019s premium brands, while Winston falls under the value for money (VFM) segment. However, Stanworth preferred to refer its VFM segment as a \\u201csub-premium\\u201d segment for the quality Winston possesses and that it sells for only RM1.50 below the price of mainstream premium brands. \\u201cUnfortunately, consumers view illicit cigarettes as real VFM [at a price per pack of about RM3.50],\\u201d he said. While acknowledging that comprehensive regulations are already in place, Stanworth said new regulations imposed by the Malaysian government need to be \\u201cfact based, and not emotionally or ideologically driven to prevent unintended consequences like driving the illegal market\\u201d. \\u201cUltimately, the government can implement any legislation it sees fit and the legitimate cigarette industry will comply. However, the government must also be mindful that it also has to live with the consequences as well, be that in lost tax revenues or undermining their own health agenda,\\u201d he said. For 9MFY13, JTI posted higher net profit of RM101.5 million from RM98.3 million a year ago, despite a marginal decrease in revenue to RM942.4 million from RM944 million due to a 4.4% decline in sales volume.On its 4QFY13 performance, Stanworth said it has \\u201cmet management expectations\\u201d but declined to elaborate as results will be released by the end of this month. Year-to-date, JTI stock rose 7.35% to close at RM6.50 last Friday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM1.7 billion. Trading down by consumers to impact VFM segment moreKUALA LUMPUR: Although consumers do trade down from the premium cigarettes segment to value for money (VFM) brands with each cigarette price increase, sales volume in the premium segment has been growing while that in the VFM segment has declined, said JT International Bhd (JTI) managing director Rob Stanworth. \\u201cSmokers will reach a point where the absolutely high price causes them to leave the legal cigarette market completely or look for alternatives within the total offering available such as going straight from premium cigarettes to illegal ones,\\u201d he told The Edge Financial Daily. However, Stanworth said with JTI having more than 50% share of the sub-premium segment with its Winston brand, it is in a good position to capture consumers who trade down within the legitimate market. To what extent would any downgrade from premium cigarettes stop at the sub-premium level? Only time would tell, he said. The reason why JTI does not have plans to penetrate the e-cigarette market at the moment, as Stanworth cited, is due to the availability of very cheap illegal cigarettes, thus making the rate of penetration of e-cigarettes relatively low in Malaysia. In its Malaysia Strategy report for the first half of the year, UOB Kay Hian Research is of the view that JTI stands to benefit from recent multiple cigarette price hikes as well as potential trading down by consumers to the VFM segment. It has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the stock at RM6.60, with a target price of RM7.70. The research firm said with a sizeable net cash pile of RM174 million or 67 sen per share, there is upside to dividends as JTI is currently only paying out half of its profits. Meanwhile, CIMB Research expects the VFM volume to see a bigger plunge as a result of the recent sharp price increase of RM1.50 per pack, given its more price-sensitive consumers. It sees the volume reduction in the premium segment, which accounts for more than 70% of British American Tobacco (M) Bhd\\u2019s revenue, to be milder as smokers in this segment tend to be less price sensitive. CIMB Research also highlighted that under the current tough operating environment, product innovation is of utmost importance, acknowledging that JTI is upgrading machines to improve the packaging of its products. CIMB has a \\u201creduce\\u201d call on JTI, with a target price of RM5.30. \\u2014 by Wei Lynn Tang This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on February 10, 2014."}, "134": {"date_posted": "7/2/2014", "title": "Hot Stock: DiGi rises 4% on FY13 results, dividend", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 7): DiGi.Com Bhd rose as much as 4% after the mobile telecommunication network provider reported full-year financials which beat market forecast.

CIMB Investment Bank Bhd analyst Kelvin Goh said DiGi's FY13 core net profit had surpassed CIMB's and consensus estimates by 5% and 4% respectively.

CIMB Group Holdings Bhd did this on Jan 13 with a private placement of 400 million new shares initially, with an upsize option of 100 million shares in the event of a more-than-expected take-up rate. The new shares were offered at RM7.10, which is at a 2% discount to the volume weighted average price of RM7.26 on Jan 10. Indeed, the response to the capital raising exercise, despite the very short time frame that was involved, was good enough for the banking group to exercise the upsize option, enabling it to place out 500 million shares to successfully raise RM3.55 billion. The new shares were taken up by both domestic and foreign institutions. One would think that this good res\\u00adponse is an indication that investors view this new capital as a positive catalyst for the banking group. Yet, CIMB Group\\u2019s share price performance did not reflect this. In fact, ever since it was re-quoted on Bursa Malaysia on Jan 15 after being suspended on Jan 13, its share price has taken a beating, falling 5.5%. It was the worst-performing stock among the listed banking groups on Bursa, although most banking stocks have not been performing well in recent times. It closed at RM7.09 on Jan 15 and hit a low of RM6.80 on Jan 23 \\u2014 a level close to last year\\u2019s low of RM6.702, recorded on Feb 19. The stock clawed back some ground to close at RM6.90 last Friday. It appears that while the institutional investors who took up the private placement still see a viable proposition in CIMB Group, there are also investors who have decided to vote with their feet to show they don\\u2019t like what is happening. Why this divergent view?  Some industry players say it\\u2019s an issue of perception \\u2014 the suddenness and the speed at which the fund-raising exercise was done had raised speculation that all may not be well in the country\\u2019s second largest banking group, perhaps fuelled by worries that its Indonesian operation via CIMB Niaga is facing some strong headwinds. Of course, the other side of the coin is that for CIMB Group to put together such a huge fund-raising exercise so quickly and push it through with such success is a testament to investor confidence in the stock. Is the selldown in the group\\u2019s shares in recent days justified? At RM6.90, CIMB Group is trading at about 12 times price-earnings ratio based on the forecast earnings for 2013 and a price-to-book value of about 1.7 times. When compared with key industry players such as Malayan Banking Bhd and Public Bank Bhd, CIMB Group\\u2019s valuations are not expensive. If investors are selling because they are worried that CIMB Group\\u2019s balance sheet has been impaired by CIMB Niaga, the concern may be a tad overdone. The banking group has been posting strong earnings growth in recent years. Moving forward, analysts generally expect this uptrend to continue, although the growth momentum this year and the next may not be as strong as before. In fact, the overall banking industry is unlikely to chart the robust growth rates that it did in the last few years. Based on net earnings of RM3.502 billion recorded during the first nine months of 2013, CIMB Group looks set to achieve higher profits for the full year. Net profit for the first three quarters was 7.3% higher than the corresponding period in 2012. Analysts have put 2013 net earnings, which will be released in February, at between RM4.5 billion and RM5.2 billion, compared with RM4.34 billion posted in FY2012 ended Dec 31. CIMB Group, however, has a bigger exposure to Indonesia, where the operating environment has become more treacherous with higher interest rates, a wide current account deficit and a depreciating rupiah. On top of that, the outlook is clouded by a presidential election due this year. Thus, despite CIMB Niaga posting a higher pre-tax profit growth of 2.5% in the first nine months of 2013, the depreciating rupiah has caused its contribution to group earnings in ringgit terms to fall 4% during the period. Indonesia contributes some 30% to CIMB Group\\u2019s earnings, compared with about 10% for Maybank, the other banking group with a huge presence there. While Indonesia has turned more challenging, the outlook isn\\u2019t all doom and gloom as the government there is already taking steps to address the problems. A financial crisis is unlikely, barring black swan events. What will happen is that loans growth will come down from the 30% growth levels to the mid-teens, and asset quality may face some erosion as interest rates rise.  Thus, the fund-raising exercise is a pre-emptive move by CIMB Group to cushion itself against a further weakening in the rupiah, which could prevent it from achieving its internal target of 9.5% to 10% for common equity tier 1 (CET-1) by 2015. We believe this is a wise move given that a further fall in the rupiah could erode the group\\u2019s CET-1 capital to below 8% without the additional RM3.55 billion raised. If the rupiah falls further and CIMB Group fails to meet its internal CET-1 target, the market could become more nervous.  The RM3.55 billion helped boost its CET-1 to 9.7% from the current 8.2%, in line with the industry average of 9.8%. CIMB Group\\u2019s pre-emptive move indicates that apart from the falling rupiah, it is taking a view that going forward, economic prospects both at home and regionally could turn out to be worse than expected. Also, with the US tapering its quantitative easing programmes, capital outflows could be greater than expected, which would have an adverse impact on emerging markets. Interestingly, just before the Asian financial crisis imploded in July 1997, CIMB had completed a rights issue in June, raising RM1.2 billion. This not only enabled the banking group to ride out the crisis but also go on an acquisition trail for cheap assets. Clearly, when there are signs that market conditions are becoming tougher, it is better to be prepared and err on the side of caution.

The \\u201cbig four\\u201d glove makers \\u2014 Hartalega Holdings Bhd, Top Glove Corp Bhd,\\u00a0 Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd and Supermax Corp Bhd \\u2014 are moving towards realigning their product mix, putting emphasis on nitrile glove production over that of natural rubber (NR) and vinyl gloves. Top Glove and Hartalega are the leading players in the nitrile segment. Hartalega is the world\\u2019s largest nitrile glove producer with a production capacity of 14 billion pieces per annum while Top Glove currently produces 10 billion pieces. All four firms plan to increase their nitrile production capacity by at least 22% by the end of this year. In a pre-emptive move, Kossan is already gearing up to become the world\\u2019s biggest nitrile producer by end-2015, overtaking both Hartalega and Top Glove in the process. The firm plans to ramp up its capacity by 59% this year to 13.5 billion pieces, from 8.5 billion presently.  As part of its aggressive expansion plan, Kossan recently acquired land in Klang to house its new manufacturing plant, which is expected to add another five billion pieces per annum in capacity. \\u00a0 \\u201cWe hope to have a product mix ratio of 70:30 between nitrile and NR products by the end of this year. There are three new plants in the pipeline, with the first one expected to be operational very soon,\\u201d says Edward Yip, Kossan\\u2019s general manager of corporate affairs and business development, at the Spotlight on Malaysia 2014 forum organised by Bursa Malaysia last week. Nitrile\\u2019s appeal comes from its position as a premium product over NR gloves. Synthetic rubber products have become the preferred choice by consumers due to the increasing prevalence of latex allergies, which may occur with prolonged contact to NR gloves. Hartalega is the clear leader in this segment because of its consistently high utilisation rates and its preference for nitrile production, which contributed 92% of total sales during the first half of its financial year ending March 31, 2014 (1HFY14). Alongside Kossan, Supermax is looking to replicate this strategy with a planned expansion of its nitrile capacity by 128% this year, according to data compiled by Maybank IB Research. While Top Glove plans to increase its own nitrile capacity by 22%, the company is currently encumbered by the margin squeeze in its NR gloves segment due to higher latex prices and low average selling price. Also, it is still seeing operating losses at its manufacturing plants in China.  The rising production of nitrile gloves is an ongoing trend as the product offers higher margins due to its higher selling price. However, with an additional 13 billion pieces expected to hit the market this year, one wonders if it would contribute to an oversupply in the market. In a Jan 16 note, Maybank IB Research says demand will likely come from Europe, where nitrile gloves command a 50% market share, compared with 80% in the US. Global demand is also expected to pick up by 15%-20% this year. \\u201cOver the longer term, the demand for nitrile remains favourable with room for growth. Capacity expansion in 2014 is expected to be led by Kossan and Supermax, which have already put in the infrastructure and secured the gas supply for their production lines,\\u201d it says. Kossan\\u2019s Yip points out that in spite of the recent hike in electricity and gas tariffs, the group remains confident of maintaining its profit margins with its nitrile growth expansion plan. \\u201cWe had already anticipated and prepared for this [energy hikes]. Labour costs also increased by 44% following the minimum wage implementation in July last year, but our margins kept increasing anyway,\\u201d he says. To deal with escalating energy prices, glove makers have raised their ASP by 1% to pass through the higher electricity costs beginning this month.  However, cheaper raw materials, which make up nearly half of the production costs, could ensure that margins remain stable in spite of the energy cost inflation. It is worth noting that latex prices have fallen to a four-year low of RM4.84 per kg due to expectation of rising supply. The main beneficiary of this would be Top Glove as it is the largest NR glove producer, says Maybank IB Research. Analysts say that the persisting nitrile theme may continue to boost the stock prices of the big four firms. CIMB Research has an \\u201coutperform\\u201d call on both Kossan and Supermax, while Maybank IB Research has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on Kossan and Top Glove. In terms of share price performance, Top Glove has lagged its peers after recording only a 0.65% gain between Jan 2 and Dec 31 last year. During the same period, Kossan\\u2019s shares gained 161%, followed by Hartalega (54%) and Supermax (46%). A useful metric for comparing the production efficiency among the big four glove makers is the gross earnings generated per thousand gloves produced. In the third quarter of last year (3QCY13), Hartalega registered gross earnings of RM28.90 per thousand gloves, followed by Kossan (RM12.50), Supermax (RM10) and Top Glove (RM7.70). According to a Jan 7 note by Alliance Research, the glove makers will be able to continue delivering decent earnings growth this year. \\u201cWe remain optimistic that the glove sector will be able to deliver earnings growth of 14%, underpinned by (1) stable latex costs, (2) weaker ringgit against the USD, and (3) healthy competition which could foster a stronger glove manufacturing industry in Malaysia,\\u201d it says. \\u00a0 While there will be stiff competition among the glove players in the nitrile segment, it is also important to note that having the highest production capacity alone does not necessarily guarantee higher margins.  The firms will have to focus on increasing operational efficiency, as well as making sure that they are not over-leveraged when undertaking aggressive expansion plans.

Markets rose on optimism after Turkey raised interest rates substantially to support its currency. In Malaysia, fund managers said the KLCI which settled at 1,789.23 at 5pm had also seen a technical rebound. The rise came on gains in stocks like Malayan Banking Bhd and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd.

The top gainer was United Plantations Bhd while Hong Leong Capital Bhd led decliners. The most-active stock was KNM Group Bhd. \"It is a technical rebound for the KLCI,\" a fund manager told theedgemalaysia.com over telephone today. He said the KLCI had risen on improving emerging currencies following Turkey's move to raise interest rates after a rout in recent days. Reuters reported that Turkey followed India by tightening policy at a midnight meeting of its central bank, with a huge hike of 425 basis points taking the overnight lending rate all the way to 12 percent. Today, Malaysia's KLCI extended gains after rising 2.37 points or 0.13% to 1,781.25 yesterday. Last Monday (January 27), the KLCI fell 23.69 points or 1.3%. The KLCI had fallen then in anticipation that US policy makers will further reduce quantitative easing (QE) measures, and on concerns about China's economy. These factors had prompted investors to sell emerging market currencies and channel funds to US dollar-denominated assets. Hence, the still-high foreign shareholding in Malaysian government bonds at 45.1% is a crucial concern, Credit Suisse economists said The economists, Michael Wan, Robert Prior-Wandesforde and Santitarn Sathirathai wrote in a note that the current foreign shareholding in Malaysian government bonds follows a 4.4% percentage point reduction since May 2013. \"Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, which were all hit during last year's mini-crisis, but not as much as India and Indonesia, are also better placed in most categories. \"Nevertheless, we still worry about the high level of foreign bond holdings in Malaysia, the political situation in Thailand and low real interest rates in both Thailand and the Philippines,\" the economists said.

The group\\u2019s market cap stood at RM9.06 billion on Jan 22 thanks to the gains in its share price, which closed at RM4.19 on the same day. This represents a staggering 49% increase from its initial public offering (IPO) issue price of RM2.80 per share, which implied a total capitalisation of RM6.05 billion. According to UMW-OG president Rohaizad Darus, the incoming deliveries of new jack-up (JU) drilling rigs will boost the group\\u2019s earnings substantially over the next two years. Drilling services contributed 94% to its total revenue for the first nine months of last year (9M2013). \\u201cIt\\u2019s simple mathematics. Our four operational rigs currently generate a certain amount of revenue. If we add another one, our bottom line will increase by 25%,\\u201d he says during a media briefing last Thursday. Rohaizad was referring to Naga 5, the group\\u2019s latest premium JU rig, which is scheduled for delivery in May. UMW-OG has already secured a US$7 million contract from Nido Petroleum Philippines Pty Ltd for the provision of drilling services by the new rig. Apart from its JU fleet, the group is also the sole Malaysian operator of hydraulic workover units (HWUs), with four currently being deployed in three countries on short- and long-term tenures. Coupled with a RM1 billion war chest from its IPO proceeds after deducting last year\\u2019s expenses, Rohaizad is confident that the group can leverage on its working relationship with Petroliam Nasional Bhd and other oil majors to secure new contracts for its JU rigs and HWUs. \\u201cWe believe we are able to finance a significant number of new rigs and also secure new contracts due to the increasing regional demand.\\u201d Despite its recent share price gains, there are contrasting valuations on the company by research houses. According to Bloomberg data, the consensus analyst view is mostly bearish with 9 out of 13 research houses issuing a \\u201cneutral\\u201d or \\u201csell\\u201d rating on UMW-OG. The most bullish are Maybank IB Research and CIMB Research, which set a target price of RM4.80 and RM4.63 respectively. At the other end of the spectrum is Goldman Sachs Research, which set a fair value of a mere RM2.70 on the oil and gas operator. In a Jan 20 note, Maybank IB argues that the delivery of another two JU rigs \\u2014 Naga 6 and Naga 7 \\u2014 by 2015 warrants a premium valuation on the stock. At RM4.80 per share, the research firm has pegged UMW-OG\\u2019s shares at 23 times projected earnings for FY2015. In its calculations, Maybank IB projected that UMW-OG\\u2019s core net profit and core earnings per share will triple within two years after taking into account the additional revenue boost from the three upcoming JU rigs. \\u201cThe market now demands new, premium JUs, favoured for their superior security, cost and operating features. More importantly, UMW-OG has the balance sheet strength to expand its JU fleet size beyond the projected five units,\\u201d it says. However, it is worth noting that new contracts are the lifeblood of oil and gas companies. UMW-OG\\u2019s contract backlog stands at RM1.45 billion, a small figure compared with the order books of other big caps such as SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd (RM28 billion) and Bumi Armada Bhd (RM10.8 billion), says Alliance Research, which has a \\u201csell\\u201d call on the stock, pegging the fair value at RM3.16. The research outfit says UMW-OG\\u2019s valuation has exceeded its peers, whose shares are currently trading at lower price-earnings multiples. \\u201cWhile the growth outlook for UMW-OG is promising, especially if the group adds on new rigs, we view that valuations have run too far ahead of peers at this juncture,\\u201d it says. At the moment, a huge chunk of UMW-OG\\u2019s revenue comes from contracts awarded by Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd (PCSB), with three out of four rigs deployed for the upstream player\\u2019s needs. Apart from PCSB, UMW-OG\\u2019s client base for the JU rigs consists of HESS, Japan Vietnam Petroleum Co and Nido Petroleum. Underlining its regional expansion plans, Rohaizad says the group is working towards achieving a 50-50 revenue contribution from domestic and overseas operations respectively. For 9M2013, 66% of its revenue came from Malaysia. \\u201cNaga 3 will be moved to Vietnam while Naga 5 will be operating in the Philippines, where we have never been to before. We also have a presence in China, Thailand, Indonesia and Turkmenistan in various capacities.\\u201d The bullish outlook is mainly supported by the upcoming expiration of a whopping 41 JU rig contracts in Southeast Asia this year. In Malaysia, there are currently 18 JUs, of which 16 are foreign owned. In line with the growing demand, daily charter rates for JUs have accordingly risen over the past four years. According to Maybank IB, average day rates are now holding steadily at US$150,000 and should rise to between US$160,000 and US$170,000 levels due to the favourable oil price environment as well as a mismatch between demand and supply. However, it is apparent that the group will have to aggressively expand its operations and secure new contracts on a consistent basis, either one of which is no small task. The drilling services industry also remains highly competitive, and there is no shortage of international oil and gas operators bidding for the same projects that UMW-OG is gunning for. UMW-OG will be spending its cash pile on two new rigs \\u2014 Naga 6 and Naga 7. Will Petronas, which is the company\\u2019s major client, also deploy the new jack-up rigs? That will determine whether the bullishness on the stock is justifiable.

US shares declined on a weakened US dollar and fears over China data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 3.7% in a week to 15,837.88 points on Monday. The steep decline in the US market last Friday put pressure on European markets. London\\u2019s FTSE100 Index declined 4.2% to 6,550.66 points while German\\u2019s DAX Index declined 3.8% to 9,349.22 points.  Commodities prices rebounded last week as the US dollar pulled back from its uptrend. The US Dollar Index fell from 81.28 points a week ago to 80.61 points. The ringgit weakened further from RM3.32 per US dollar to RM3.34. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures rose 1.7% in week to US$95.63 per barrel after pulling back from US$97.35 last Thursday. Commodity Exchange gold futures increased only 0.2% in a week to US$1,256.40 an ounce. The weakened ringgit and rising crude oil prices boosted crude palm oil prices. Crude palm oil futures pulled back last week, declining 2% to RM2,532 per tonne.  Daily FBM KLCI chart as at January 28, 2014. The KLCI decline accelerated in the past\\u00a0 week compared with the previous week, indicating a stronger short-term bearish momentum. The index fell below the uptrend support line at 1,800 points and rebounded from the November 2013 support level yesterday. The rebound, however, was weak. The trend is bearish in the short term as it continued to stay below the short-term 30-day moving average. The worrying indication is that the index has slightly fallen below the Ichimoku Cloud, which indicates a possible trend reversal. Momentum indicators like the RSI, MACD and Momentum Oscillator are indicating strong bearish momentum but near oversold levels in the short term. I mentioned in my previous article three weeks ago that the index may only find a support level at 1,780\\u00a0 to 1,790 points. Now that the index is at this level, we may expect prices to consolidate or rebound. The strong bearish momentum may cause a rebound to be difficult as it represents a bearish sentiment. Henceforth, we may expect prices to consolidate at this level this week as the market is expected to be quieter in the next two weeks due to the lunar new year festival and holiday. It may be a bearish start for the new year but there may be opportunities in this current downtrend as it is a correction of the long-term uptrend. Therefore, it is good to keep an eye on any strong indications of a reversal to confirm that the market is being supported and ready to continue the uptrend. Until then, I think it is better to stay out of the market and have a good short week in ushering in the Year of the Horse. Here\\u2019s wishing everyone Gong Xi Fa Cai and happy holidays.

The index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (May 2013) and it represented an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cFlat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cPseudo-Bull\\u201d rise completed.  The price movements in the index in the months following May 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low) and 1,882.20 (high). The index\\u2019s daily signals are mainly negative. The CCI, DMI, Oscillator and MACD are negative while the Stochastic is positive. As such, the index\\u2019s weaker support levels are seen at 1,759, 1,780 and 1,801 points, while the resistance areas of 1,808, 1,838 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some heavy profit-taking activities.  Our downside targets of 1,795, 1,760 and 1,730 for the index in the short term have now emerged out of the bearish price moves since Dec 31, 2013. Its simple moving averages (MA) depict a mixed tone for its chart time frames. Its daily chart has turned negative, while the weekly chart is neutral but the monthly chart appears buoyant for now.  Due to its mixed chart signals, we believe investors may adopt a \\u201ctake profit\\u201d philosophy as the KLCI remains at fairly lofty levels with bearish divergent signals. As such, profit-taking on index components as well as small to mid caps will persist into the next fortnight before and after the Chinese New Year holidays. Concerns over the local higher bond yields (especially on the 10-year bonds), a consistent weaker tone for regional currencies against the US dollar and persistent foreign fund equity selling may keep the index and local markets under further pressure for a potential decline. Due to the lofty tone of the KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201csell\\u201d on KPJ Healthcare Bhd, which is a RM3.4 billion market cap company with a return on equity of 10.3% based on its 12-month trailing earnings. It seems that the recent weakening of the ringgit and the downward KLCI movement are causing investors to shift towards a more defensive position towards more cash.  Despite KPJ being a healthcare bellwether, it was not spared. The steady decline in its stock price could be attributed to weaker profitability and losses at the group\\u2019s three newly opened hospitals, namely KPJ Bandar Baru Klang, KPJ Pasir Gudang and PT Khasanah Putera Jakarta Medica. Maybank IB does not have fundamental coverage on KPJ. A check on Bloomberg consensus reveals 13 brokers have coverage on the stock, with two brokers having a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the stock, six \\u201csell\\u201d calls and five \\u201chold\\u201d. The stock is currently trading at a lofty historical price-earnings ratio of 30 times and a price-to-book value of 3.3 times. KPJ\\u2019s indicated dividend yield is at a low 1.86%. KPJ\\u2019s chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames are weak indeed. Its share price made an obvious plunge since its monthly Wave-2 high of RM4.14 in December 2013. Since that high, KPJ declined to its recent January 2014 low of RM3.30.  Its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly downtrends to its recent low of RM3.30. As it broke above its recent key critical supports of RM4.23 and RM4.02, look to sell KPJ on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term downtrends for this stock.  The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI and MACD) are negative and now depict the obvious indications of KPJ\\u2019s eventual decline to much lower levels.  We expect KPJ to remain weak towards its support levels of RM3.04, RM3.11 and RM3.30. It will attract major liquidation activities at the resistance levels of RM3.52, RM4.02 and RM4.23. Its downside targets are now located at RM2.89, RM2.13 and RM2.00.Lee Cheng Hooi is the regional chartist at Maybank Kim Eng.

But on the positive side, it said Affin will become the second largest broker in Malaysia after the deal is completed. For the broking business, HDIB and Affin were ranked No.5 and No. 10 respectively, in terms of trading value on Bursa Securities in 2013.

Yesterday, KLCCP released its fourth quarter (4QFY13) results, reporting flat year-on-year revenue of RM331.0 million, with net profit of RM373.1 million, up from RM99.6 million in the previous year. For the full year of 2013, net profit fell to RM825.5 million from RM1.464 billion the previous year, while revenue rose to RM1.279 billion from RM1.178 billion. In its comments today, CIMB Investment Bank said the lack of new asset acquisitions will not assist in boosting KLCCP\\u2019s profits for FY14, while the risk of rising interest rates would negatively affect its share price. \\u201cWe believe that external acquisitions would remain challenging despite KLCCP\\u2019s healthy balance sheet. \\u201cThis is due to the current status quo between buyers and sellers, resulting in a lack of potential acquisitions,\\u201d said the research house. Besides acquisitions, CIMB IB said that KLCCP\\u2019s property development projects, such as the Menara Dayabumi project, would only be completed within two to three years. \\u201cWe expect KLCCP\\u2019s earnings in 2014 to be mainly driven by the reduction in its tax rates as it would take full effect this year,\\u201d said the research house.

Sharing CIMB's views, HwangDBS Vickers Research (HDBSVR) said that higher assessment taxes and electricity tariff rates will provide 2% and 5% downside to the group\\u2019s earnings in FY14 and FY15 respectively. \\u201cHowever, these may be passed on through rental reversions on expiring leases and potentially higher service and promotional charges,\\u201d said HDBSVR.

From the record high, the index declined 65 points or 3.5% to 1,807.6 points on Monday. Yesterday, the index rebounded and the question is now whether there will be a follow-through on the rebound. Basically, market sentiment was supported by increases in the US and European markets. The regional market, however, remained lacklustre.  The KLCI declined 1.1% in a week to 1,815.34 points yesterday after rebounding from an intra-day low of 1,801.31 points on Monday. Trading volume was firm at an average daily volume of two billion shares compared with the same period two weeks ago. Decliners trounced gainers 11 to 1 in the past week and were led by Public Bank Bhd (-3.4%), Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd (-2.9%) and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (-2.6). Gainers were led by AMMB Holdings Bhd (+0.7%) and Genting Malaysia Bhd (+0.5%). Global markets started to pull back on the first few trading days after the new year. Singapore\\u2019s Straits Times Index increased only 0.3% in a week to 3,134.50 points. Hong Kong\\u2019s Hang Seng Index increased 1.1% to 23,033.12 points. China\\u2019s Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index declined 0.9% to 2,008.31 points. The US Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.4% in a week to 16,485.56 points on Monday. In Europe, the UK\\u2019s FTSE 100 index increased 1.2% in a week to 6,836.73 points, just a few points below its 13-year high while Germany\\u2019s DAX Index declined 1.3% to 9,715.90 points after pulling back from a historical high of 9,742.96 points last Friday.  The US dollar continued to strengthen against major currencies last week. The US dollar index increased from 80.61 points to 81.28 points last Monday. This caused the ringgit to weaken against the greenback. The ringgit weakened from RM3.26 against a US dollar a week ago to RM3.32. Gold prices, which were trending upwards since late December last year, started to feel some pressure this week as the greenback strengthens. Commodity Exchange gold stayed firm in a week at US$1,254.10 (RM4,163.61) an ounce. New York Mercantile Exchange West Texas Intermediate crude oil rebounded 2.7% to US$94.03 per barrel after declining for two weeks. Crude palm oil rose 3.8% in a week to RM2,588 per tonne on a weaker ringgit. Technically, the KLCI is in a correction of an uptrend. The index rebounded exactly on the uptrend line on Monday, indicating that there is still support for the uptrend. However, the index is below the short-term 30-day moving average and is currently in the Ichimoku Cloud. These indicators show there is a possibility of further downward correction, unless the KLCI does not test the low on Monday again, which is the uptrend support level. The KLCI should remain bullish as long as it stays above the uptrend support line. Momentum indicators have started to turn bearish. The RSI indicator continued to decline below the mid-level and the MACD indicator fell below its mid-level. Furthermore, The Bollinger Bands are expanding with the KLCI trading near the bottom band. These indicators show that the downtrend momentum may continue if the index does not rebound from current levels and break above the immediate resistance level. The immediate resistance level to break to bring back positive market sentiment is at 1,835 points. Technically, the market sentiment may continue to weaken because of the bearish momentum. Furthermore, the weakening ringgit is a turn-off for the local market. However, the KLCI is currently oversold in the short term and is at the support level of the uptrend and therefore a rebound is expected. Furthermore, rebounds in the regional market may boost market sentiment. The rebound may only be confirmed if the index is able to break above the immediate resistance level at 1,835 points. Henceforth, I expect to see the KLCI trying to test this level this week and failure to do so would cause the index to remain bearish.

We are now back in the acquisition market this year as yield compressions have come off quite a bit,\\u201d LaBrooy said at a media briefing on Axis-REIT\\u2019s performance for 2013 yesterday. Axis-REIT, which currently has 31 properties under its portfolio, decided not to acquire assets last year due to massive compression in REIT yields across the board as share prices increased. This created a distortion in asset prices as they rose sharply in anticipation of continued low yield and interest rate environment. LaBrooy said the company\\u2019s new asset acquisitions will be funded by a combination of share placement in the equity market and internal funds. Since it was listed in 2005, the company has undertaken four rounds of equity placements, raising a total of RM487.4 million.  As at Dec 31, 2013, Axis-REIT has cash and cash equivalents of RM34.8 million.  For the 2013 financial year (FY13), Axis-REIT recorded a total trust revenue of RM141.98 million, a 6.8% increase from RM132.97 million recorded in FY12. Realised gross revenue of RM141.3 million was contributed by rental income of RM133 million and car park income of RM5.57 million. Profit for the full year rose to RM111.28 million against RM103.12 million FY12. The group announced an 18.5% dividend per unit for FY13, an increase from 17.3 sen distributed in 2012. For the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2013, Axis-REIT recorded a total trust revenue of RM36.19 million and realised income before taxation of RM21.45 million. In FY13, the company sold Axis Plaza to a subsidiary of Singapore Post for RM34 million. This resulted in a gain of RM10.94 million, which will only be realised in April this year. Axis-REIT said portfolio occupancy was at 94.87% in 2013, despite Axis Business Campus being vacated for enhancement. Occupancy rates have been noted to range from 92.27% to 97.22% in the past five years. Hwang DBS Vickers has a buy call on the stock with a target price of RM3.60.

The government yesterday announced its long-awaited revised policy on the auto sector, which targets to reduce car prices by 20% to 30% in five years. The NAP contains measures to increase competition in the auto sector, particularly in the energy-efficient vehicle (EEV) segment. The policy\\u2019s main objective is to make Malaysia the regional automotive hub for EEV. The freeze on new manufacturing licences for cars below 1,800cc would be lifted, but only for EEV. The government hopes to issue three to four manufacturing licences for EEV by 2018. The government will also provide RM2.07 billion in funds over seven years to attract foreign and domestic investments in the EEV segment. There will be no investment and equity conditions imposed on the new manufacturing licences. In a note today, CIMB Research commented that the NAP raises more questions than it clears doubts. \\u201cAfter an 18-month delay, the NAP 2014 was a disappointment. It did not contain an end-of-life vehicle (ELV) policy and extended the timeline to end the open approved permit (AP) system. \\u201cExcise duties will not be cut and the projected 20-30% reduction in the average car prices over the next five years is already in motion, with ASEAN localisation and lower import duties,\\u201d said the research house. The most notable incentive is the tax and duty exemption for all hybrid and CKD electric vehicles, in line with the government\\u2019s aim of making Malaysia an energy efficient vehicle (EEV) production hub. \\u201cThis reinforces Tan Chong as our top pick. But we maintain \\u2018neutral\\u2019 on the sector.\\u201d HwangDBS Vickers Research commented that the NAP 2014 lacks details, but noted Honda already has the first mover advantage. \\u201cThere was pledged gradual 20-30% car price reduction by 2017, but with no review of the current high excise duties.\\u201d Expressing \\u201cdisappointments\\u201d that there was no review of AP (open and franchise), HwangDBS said this has led to more leakages for manufacturers. HwangDBS said its top pick is DRB-Hicom Bhd (Target price: RM3.50) as it has a wide range of marques and credible Proton turnaround plan. In a note, Maybank Investment Bank said: \\u201cThe key measures announced were as expected. The intention to make Malaysia a regional hub for EEV is noble but we think it lacks clarity for now.\\u201d But unlike CIMB, HwangDBS, and Maybank IB, the new NAP was seen as \\u201ccatalysing a super-cycle growth story\\u201d by AmResearch which gives an \\u201coverweight\\u201d rating on the sector. \\u201cWe sense that the NAP is now more outward looking, thrusted by Malaysia\\u2019s EEV program, which encompasses a competitive tax incentive structure, a focus on scale creation and creation of a competitive export hub.\\u201d It said the revised NAP will prove a strategic turning point for the local auto industry, riding on early cycle investments into \\u201cgreen car\\u201d production in ASEAN. And the critical factors behind its bullish view are:-(1) a much more robust option for foreign OEMs to qualify for \\u201cgreen car\\u201d production tax incentives; (2) EEV tax incentives will give a quantum leap to the current level of localisation-driven excise duty rebate; (3) huge spin-off impact; non-EEV models sharing common parts with EEV models; (4) complete liberalisation of auto manufacturing license for EEV production; and (5) massive scale from new capacity to improved price competency of Malaysian auto parts sector. On stock picks, AmResearch said BAuto is its top pick as a play into the green theme (BUY, FV: RM2.30/share). DRB-Hicom (BUY, FV: RM3.65/share) is seen as a beneficiary via its stake in 34% owned Honda Malaysia. AmResearch has also upgraded APM to \\u201cbuy\\u201d from \\u201chold\\u201d (FV: RM6.40/share) as parts suppliers are key beneficiaries of the potential influx of new capacity.

Profit-taking activities on the local bourse dampened sentiment, affecting many index-linked counters including CIMB Group. At the close of trading yesterday, CIMB shares were down 21 sen or 2.88%, with 20.32 million shares done \\u2014 making the banking group Bursa Malaysia\\u2019s 11th biggest decliner. The intraday low was RM6.95. In early trading yesterday, the stock dropped nearly 5% before recovering in the afternoon, trading slightly above the issue price of RM7.10. CIMB had announced the RM3.55 billion capital raising exercise via a private placement of 500 million new shares, or 6.08% of its enlarged share capital, at RM7.10 apiece. The rationale was to reposition its capital for growth, following a sharp depreciation in the Indonesian rupiah. The new issue lifts CIMB Group\\u2019s common equity tier 1 (CET1) as at Sept 30, 2013 from 8.2% to approximately 9.7%. The new equity was placed to domestic and foreign investors over the course of the working day last Monday. The offer was well oversubscribed and enabled CIMB Group to increase the deal size by 25% from 400 million to 500 million shares. Analysts had mixed reactions to CIMB Group\\u2019s share placement, due to the dilutive effect the exercise will have on the group\\u2019s equity and earnings despite boosting capital ratios. KAF Investment Research estimates that the placement will have a dilutive impact of up to 100 basis points on CIMB Group\\u2019s return on equity (ROE). \\u201cThe core equity ratio of the CIMB Group was 7.64% and tier-1 capital adequacy ratio (CAR) was 9.16%, relatively low amongst Malaysian banks and probably explain the rationale for raising extra capital,\\u201d said KAF in a note yesterday. \\u201cAssuming a 4.5% yield on the funds raised, we estimate there is a 3% earnings per share (EPS) dilution from the private placement. The impact on ROE is larger at about a 100 basis points reduction,\\u201d it added. The private placement will raise core equity and tier-1 CAR by approximately 200 basis points each, thus providing an adequate buffer even under the Basel III framework. KAF is maintaining its \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on CIMB Group, but has cut its target price to RM8.40 from RM9.10 previously. The research house said the knee-jerk selling after the placement would be a good buying opportunity for investors. UOB KayHian Research believes CIMB is highly likely to miss its internal target of achieving a group common equity tier-1 (CET1) of 9.5% by 2015, dragged by slower growth in its Indonesian operation. It projects a negative dilution impact on 2014F EPS of 6% and expects 2014F ROE to possibly moderate from the estimate of 15.1% to 14.1%. \\u201cGiven the intensifying growth headwinds in Indonesia, and hence potential earnings downgrades coupled with the dilution effect from the recent capital-raising exercise, we believe that sentiment on the stock is likely to remain poor,\\u201d the research house said in a note. \\u201cThe capital-raising exercise may have come as a slight surprise to the market given the fact that the company alluded that it viewed its 8.2% group CET1 ratio as optimal. It had sufficient time to build additional capital buffers in light of its dividend reinvestment plan, and full implementation of Basel III would only kick in by 2019.\\u201d UOB KayHian is maintaining its \\u201chold\\u201d position on CIMB Group and lowering its target price to RM7.51 from RM7.80, after incorporating the dilution.

There were a few positive surprises from Prestariang\\u2019s presentations, which include its seriousness in scaling up its oil and gas (O&G) training business as its existing school is already operating at full capacity. It is looking to set up a new O&G training school in Johor, probably sometime this year.  The company said it also expected strong revenue contribution from its Autodesk software in the fourth quarter (4Q) of 2013 as it had finalised new distribution terms with Autodesk in 3Q13. Prestariang is now the master distributor for Autodesk software for the education and O&G sector. The company is also looking at acquiring regional businesses which have synergies with its current core business. It has already hired a consultant to search for opportunities in the region. We are bullish on the company\\u2019s recent venture into the O&G training business, which should be the main earnings growth driver over the next few years. Our forecasts do not incorporate any earnings from the expansion plans for this business. The expansion of this business in the region is long-term positive for the company but is not expected to make significant immediate or medium-term contributions. Remain invested in the stock. Its long-term growth outlook is exciting, thanks to its recent venture in the booming O&G training business. With HELP International Corp Bhd likely to be taken private, there are limited options for investors looking for stocks in the education sector, other than Prestariang.

Regional bond risks rose as China\\u2019s inflation eased and producer prices extended declines, adding to the signs that the economy is weakening. The US dollar climbed before the jobs data was due last night.  Expectation that the initial jobless claims would fall caused the American markets to ease off on Wednesday night. The SP500 lost 0.27 points to close at 1,837.61 points whilst the Dow fell 68.2 points to end at 16,462.74. The FBM KLCI traded in a sideways range of 15.4 points for the week with volumes of 1.6 billion to 1.96 billion shares done. The index closed at 1,828.21 yesterday, down 3.09 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like IOI Corp Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, CIMB Bank Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd caused the index to decline on profit taking activities yesterday. The index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (May 2013) and it represented an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cFlat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cPseudo-Bull\\u201d rise completed. The index price movements in the next few months following May 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low) and 1,882.2 (high). The index\\u2019s daily signals are mixed. The CCI and MACD are negative while the DMI, Oscillator and Stochastic are positive. As such, the index\\u2019s obvious support levels are seen at the 1,780, 1,800 and 1,822 levels, whilst the resistance areas of 1,828, 1,849 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some heavy profit-taking activities. Our upside targets of 1,898, 1,900 and 1,924 for the index in the medium term may be deferred for now. Its simple moving averages (MA) depict a double time frame (weekly and monthly) uptrend for now. Its daily chart has turned into a neutral position in January 2014. Due to its mixed signals, we believe investors may adopt a \\u201crange trading\\u201d philosophy as the KLCI remains at fairly lofty levels with bearish divergent signals. As such, profit-taking on index components as well as small to mid caps may persist into the next fortnight. Despite the lofty tone of the KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201cbuy\\u201d on MKH Bhd, which is a RM1.1 billion market cap company with a return on equity of 12% based on its 12-month trailing earnings. The stock made a new recent high of RM3.27 in tandem with the improving sentiment of the small and mid cap property stocks. It seems that the recent recurring theme from the property segment is the asset revaluation approach, where investors favour property companies with strategic landbank with development potential.  The firm rise in the stock price can be attributed to investors\\u2019 optimism on its strong earnings trend led by the plantation and property and construction division. For the fourth quarter of financial year 2013 ended Sept 30, MKH\\u2019s group revenue rose 21%. The rise was attributed to its plantation division\\u2019s higher sales of crude palm oil and palm kernel, as well as the property and construction division\\u2019s revenue from ongoing and new developments. Despite the better profitability, profit before tax was lower due to an inclusion of foreign exchange losses in the current quarter totalling RM63 million due to a weakening rupiah and ringgit against the US dollar. Maybank-IB does not have fundamental coverage on MKH. A check on Bloomberg consensus revealed that three brokers have coverage on the stock, with all having a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the stock.  The stock is currently trading at a reasonable historical price-earnings ratio of 10 times and a price-to-book value of 1.2 times. MKH\\u2019s indicated dividend yield is at 3.14%. Its chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly timeframes are very strong indeed. Its share price made an obvious surge since its monthly Wave-2 low of 57 sen in October 2008. Since that 57 sen low, MKH surged to its recent January 2014 high of RM3.27.  Its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to the recent high of RM3.27. As it broke above its recent key critical resistances of RM2.62 and RM2.85, look to buy MKH on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to long term uptrends for this stock.  The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD and Oscillator) are very strong and now depict the obvious indications of MKH\\u2019s eventual surge to higher levels. We expect MKH to remain very firm towards its support levels of RM2.62, RM2.85 and RM3.10.  It will attract minor profit taking at the resistance levels of RM3.27, RM3.58 and RM4.13. Its upside targets are now located at RM3.45, RM3.76, RM4.09 and RM4.22.

She also predicts that O&G, property, water, shipping and banking sectors will do well in the new lunar year, which starts on Jan 31 (Chinese New Year). But the worst performing sectors under her feng shui reading are wood-based sectors, including timber and plantations. These predictions of Lilian Too, one of the most influential bankers in the 1980s when she served the Hong Leong Group in Malaysia and Hong Kong, were made at CIMB\\u2019s Corporation Day yesterday. In a note today, CIMB Research said there are many similarities between Too\\u2019s predictions.

The worst performing sectors are timber and plantations,\\u201d the note said. CIMB Research noted that its KLCI target of 2030 points in 2014 is one of the highest, if not, the highest among securities analysts. While CIMB is bullish on construction and real estate, as well as oil and gas sectors, it is neutral on the plantation sector. \\u201cThe only sectors where the views diverge are perhaps timber, which is wood-based\\u2026 We believe that timber companies will benefit from higher log production and rising plywood prices,\\u201d said CIMB. CIMB said it also likes selective smaller cap stocks due to their attractive valuations. The research house advises investors to stick with the ETP beneficiaries this year as they will continue to gain from positive newsflow during the year. \\u201cOur top-3 picks are SapuraKencana for oil & gas, Gamuda for construction and Mah Sing for property.

MyEG clarified in a Bursa Malaysia announcement yesterday that the computer system (MyGST) refers to a new system which the Customs department is testing to facilitate the implementation of the GST by April 1, 2015.  \\u201cThere are a few parties involved in the various components of this system of which MyEG, via its 40%-owned associate company, MyEG Integrated Networks Sdn Bhd (MINT), is one of these parties. As of to date, MyEG has not entered into any legally binding agreement with the Customs department,\\u201d it said in the announcement. MyEG said that it will announce accordingly should it receive any contract from the Customs department. The news report said the system, which costs some RM100 million, includes a back-up should the primary MyGST system fail.  A senior analyst from CIMB Investment Bank Bhd, Nigel Foo, said he is confident MyEG should be able to secure the contract from the Customs department, as the company has been working on this project for the past few years and has successfully completed the pilot project in 2012. \\u201cIf all goes well in the first phase of this project, we believe MyEG would extend this service to the other sectors of the economy, likely the retail sector next.

The proposed merger of PBB-L and PBB-F will be undertaken without any form of compensation to shareholders, whether locals or foreigners. The exercise is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2014. This does not come as a surprise to us, although it was not guided by management. In fact, this move is long overdue as the purpose of maintaining two types of shares is to ensure that the foreign shareholding (by voting rights) in PBB is limited to a maximum of 30% but this can now be achieved with the electronic trading system. The exercise will be slightly positive for PBB as it will avoid confusion for some investors, especially foreigners, and eliminate the related administrative costs for maintaining two classes of shares. Despite PBB\\u2019s healthy FY14 earnings growth and above-industry loan momentum, we are not advising investors to accumulate the stock given its pricey FY14 PER of 14.5 times.

AirAsia\\u2019s share price has declined by more than 10% since the budget airline announced its nine-month results ended Sept 30, 2013 that came below expectations. AirAsia group chief executive officer Tan Sri Tony Fernandes told The Edge Financial Daily that investors should pick up the undervalued stock given its prospects. He said shareholders should be in it for long term as the group moves into its next phase of development to become the Emirates of the Asia-Pacific region.  \\u201cI am in for the long term and want to give shareholders value,\\u201d he said in a recent interview. Fernandes and his partner Datuk Kamarudin Meranun have deemed interest of 23% in AirAsia via Tune Air Sdn Bhd. He advised shareholders to be patient despite the fluctuating share prices of AirAsia. \\u201cWe are not the hot girl in town but if you are a long-time investor, the upsides will be good,\\u201d he said without elaborating further. The drop in AirAsia\\u2019s share price was mainly due to a sell-down by foreign shareholders, paring their shareholding to 49% as at end November from 52% in the first half of 2013. At the current level, AirAsia shares are trading at an undemanding financial year 2014 price-to-earnings ratio of just over seven times. The counter closed at RM2.22 on Dec 31, 2013, down 12.9% for the year. However, not all analysts recommend a \\u201cbuy\\u201d on the stock due to the increasingly competitive environment at home. CIMB Research, for one, lowered the target price of AirAsia from RM3.05 to RM2.55 and downgraded it from \\u201coutperform\\u201d to \\u201cneutral\\u201d. The research house noted that yield pressure on the budget airline will persist in 2014 with newcomer Malindo Air and national carrier Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS). However, RHB Research in a December note said AirAsia\\u2019s share price may have hit the bottom at the RM2.22-level, and view the stock as a bargain. It also believes that AirAsia will continue to be more prudent on costs come 2014 and more importantly, should Malindo Air and MAS get more conservative in their future expansion plans and pricing strategies, the downward pressure on Air Asia\\u2019s yields will dissipate. Meanwhile, AirAsia said that it is not overly worried about the rising fare war in the domestic market, where the airline commands a 60% share, and intends to hit back in the competition. Fernandes: I am in for the long term and want to give shareholders value. Furthermore, Fernandes and Kamarudin, who was recently redesignated as executive chairman of AirAsia, have announced that they will now play a more active role in the airline with emphasis on further cost reduction.Fernandes and Kamarudin announced last month their \\u201creturn\\u201d to Malaysia just over a year, after passing on the baton to new AirAsia CEO Aireen Omar to lead domestic operations while the duo lead regional operations out of Jakarta, Indonesia. Additionally, Fernandes said the AirAsia story will also include its plans for its 13.76% affiliate AirAsia X Bhd. AirAsia X, with 16 planes to date, will have 57 planes including six leased ones by 2019, said Fernandes.  The long-haul budget carrier had earlier this month made its largest single order of Airbus SAS wide-body aircraft for US$6 billion (RM19.68 billion). With the fleet expansion, Fernandes said the plan is for AirAsia X to resume European routes and likely add New York to its list of new routes to the US. He added that the group is already putting into plans for AirAsia X to return to Paris and London by 2016 after it axed the routes in 2012. Fernandes said with AirAsia\\u2019s extensive network, the group is adding a new dimension that will enable AirAsia X and AirAsia to offer a \\u201cseamless experience\\u201d where the baggage system and one fare price will be applicable to passengers.

Against 2013\\u2019s gain of 10.54% for the KLCI, research houses\\u2019 targets for 2014 appear slightly muted. A look at some research houses\\u2019 KLCI targets for 2014 showed year-end forecasts ranging from 1,920 to 2,030 points, with CIMB Research having the most optimistic forecast. The research house cited a well-executed Economic Transformation Programme as a key catalyst for its optimism in the broader market as well as more subdued political risks after the 13th general election. Maybank Investment Bank Research, which has a KLCI target of 1,940 points, pointed out that Malaysia\\u2019s strong macro-economic fundamentals and corporate balance sheet strength bodes well despite expensive valuations for Malaysian equities. \\u201cPolitical concerns have diminished, fiscal balance issues are being addressed and domestic liquidity remains ample. \\u201cWhile the KLCI\\u2019s16.3 times one-year forward PER [price-earnings ratio] on an 8.1% earnings growth offering implies a rather \\u2018pricey\\u2019 price-earnings to growth of two times, the sustainability of Malaysia\\u2019s longer term growth on strong macro-economic policies and banking and corporate balance sheet strength will continue to lend support to the premium rating,\\u201d said the research house in its strategy report. \\u201cWe expect Malaysian equities\\u2019 defensiveness to stand out yet again amid external volatilities in 2014, albeit at a milder level with the US QE [quantitative easing] taper being priced in,\\u201d it added. The seven research houses\\u2019 targets averaged out to 1,957, equating to a 4.8% increase for the index, which closed at 1,866.96 on Tuesday. This is lower than the 10.54% increase in the KLCI in 2013. The lower growth expectations came amidst concerns mainly of a pullback of foreign funds as a result of Federal Reserve tapering of its quantitative easing policy and poorer consumer sentiment due to fiscal consolidation. A pullback in foreign investor funds in Asian markets is expected after the Fed announced its decision to taper by US$10 billion (RM32.8 billion) per month to US$75 billion starting this month, with the expectation that it occurs at a modest pace in 2014. \\u201cThere could be a pullback in terms of foreigners investing in this part of the region, but that\\u2019s only temporary \\u2026 the Fed is tapering gradually, which is the right strategy,\\u201d said investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management Sdn Bhd, Bharat Joshi. Nomura Equity Research warned that Malaysia, along with Indonesia, India and Thailand appear to be the most vulnerable to a \\u201cdisorderly QE unwind\\u201d scenario. \\u201cThis is due to higher than average equity inflows to local stocks since 2011, non-financial sector corporate net debt, and economy-wide private-sector debt,\\u201d it said. Michael Kurtz, global head of equity strategy at Nomura Equity Research, said that the best performing sectors in 2014 are likely to be externally focused. \\u201cWe are not negative on domestic cyclical stocks per se \\u2014 Malaysia is one of the economies we feel more confident with, along with Philippines and South Korea,\\u201d he said in a phone interview with The Edge Financial Daily. \\u201cHowever, defensive stocks such as telcos, utilities and consumer staples are likely to underperform in 2014 and we have recently downgraded telcos to underweight,\\u201d he said. According to Bharat, the education and healthcare sector are key focus areas in Malaysian equities for 2014, while consumer staples and telcos are on the wary watchlist. \\u201cGenerally, investors are looking at where Malaysia\\u2019s strengths are \\u2014 Malaysia wants to be the education and healthcare hub, and the reason for that is because we have plenty of landbank. \\u201cWe are tapping on both Singapore\\u2019s expensive healthcare \\u2014 where we see Singaporeans coming over to Johor \\u2014 and benefiting from the setting up of education hubs in Johor and private schools around Kuala Lumpur,\\u201d said Bharat. \\u201cWell-to-do Indonesians who are looking for good healthcare but who do not wish to pay Singapore prices are coming to Malaysia,\\u201d he said. On the education sector, he said education providers who are keen on expanding are an indicator of the positive outlook on the sector, pointing to Epsom College set up by AirAsia Bhd\\u2019s Tan Sri Tony Fernandes. Bharat said: \\u201cThe government is also trying to push Visit Malaysia 2014 \\u2014 we are seeing theme parks coming into the market and that could be a pull factor.  \\u201cIncreased tourism should play quite a role because when local domestic consumption slows, they can easily take over and that\\u2019s quite crucial because we still need to iron the chains of consumption \\u2014 if people are not consuming, at least your tourism sector picks up, so that\\u2019s positive. \\u201cWhat we are going to see is more intra-Asean trade in certain sectors taking a role rather than FDIs from the West coming into the market,\\u201d he said, adding that he foresees consumer staples, property and REITs underperforming in the coming year. Meanwhile, most research houses are \\u201cneutral\\u201d on the telco sector due to intensifying competition, decline in SMS revenues and increased capital expenditure. They remain bullish on oil and gas, construction, aviation and utilities. The sectors most have a cautious view on are consumer, property, automotive and gaming. Nevertheless, CIMB is bullish on gaming and property. It said it believes the government\\u2019s measures to curb speculation will be short lived and buyers\\u2019 appetite will return in the second half of 2014. Meanwhile, Bharat is \\u201cneutral\\u201d on telcos and consumers. \\u201cI would say that consumer names which have been very strong this year and the last would see some profit taking \\u2014 companies the likes of Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd, Dutch Lady Milk Industries Bhd, Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd might experience some headwinds in terms of being able to grow their topline, so they would be the ones that might see some profit-taking as valuations for the consumer sector are not cheap,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI think that the outlook for 2014 is going to be slightly below expectations and a lot more cautious\\u00a0 and the reason for that is because there is a lot more challenges, both external and internal,\\u201d he added.
