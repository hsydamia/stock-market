Energy, material, healthcare companies and sectors that fell heavily over the past three months were among the best performers. The S&P 500 Index gained 35.94 points to 1,920.03 points while the Dow surged 235.57 points to end at 16,284.70.\\u00a0 The FBM KLCI moved in a narrower range of 39.91 points for the week with lower volumes of 1.52 billion shares to 1.69 billion share traded. The index closed at 1,633.93 yesterday, up 12.89 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like British American Tobacco (M) Bhd, IOI Corp Bhd, Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd, Petronas Dagangan Bhd and Petronas Gas Bhd and Sime Darby Bhd caused the index to rise on bargain-hunting activities. The ringgit was slightly weaker against the US dollar at 4.4030 as Brent crude oil inched up to US$48.05 (RM211.90) per barrel.\\u00a0 The index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (July 2014) and it represents an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cFlat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cPseudo-Bull\\u201d rise completed. The next few months\\u2019 index price movements since July 2014 comprise key swings of 1,837.28 (low), 1,879.62 (high), 1,766.22 (low), 1,858.09 (high), 1,671.82 (low), 1,810.21 (high), 1,706.18 (low), 1,831.41 (high), 1,774.30 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,685.03 (low), 1,744.19 (high), 1,503.68 (low) and 1,691.93 (high). The index\\u2019s daily signals have turned marginally positive, with its CCI, DMI, MACD, Oscillator and Stochastic indicators showing emerging buy signals. As such, the index\\u2019s support levels are seen at 1,567, 1,595 and 1,633, while profit-taking at the resistance areas of 1,635, 1,661 and 1,691 will cap the index\\u2019s advances.\\u00a0 The KLCI\\u2019s 18 and 40 simple moving averages (SMA) depict an emerging uptrend for its short-term daily chart. The index\\u2019s price bars are below the 50 and 200 SMA and this depicts a softer phase for the medium- to longer-term moving averages. Due to the steady tone for the KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Magni-Tech Industries Bhd (Magni). A check on the Bloomberg consensus reveals that no research house covers the stock fundamentally. Magni currently trades at a low historical price-earnings ratio of 10.45 times. Its price-to-book value ratio of 2.09 times indicates that its share price is trading at a premium to its book value. Recently, the company announced that it will pay a dividend of 10 sen on Nov 20 to shareholders on record as of Nov 9. Magni\\u2019s chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly up. Its share price has made an obvious surge since its major weekly Wave-2 low of RM0.84 in August 2011. Since that RM0.84 low, Magni rose to its September 2015 recent all-time high of RM5.60. As prices broke above their recent key critical resistance levels of RM4.65 and RM4.80, look to buy Magni on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term uptrend for this stock.\\u00a0 The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD, Stochastic and Oscillator) have issued clear buy signals and now depict firm indications of Magni\\u2019s eventual surge towards higher levels. It would attract firm buying activities at the support levels of RM4.65, RM4.80 and RM5.59. We expect Magni to witness some profit-taking at its resistance area and all-time high of RM5.60. Its upside targets are at RM5.93, RM6.58, RM7.35 and RM9.15. Lee Cheng Hooi is the regional chartist at Maybank Kim Eng.

The disposal is part of UEM Sunrise\\u2019s plan to unlock the value of its assets and to raise funds to redeem the 450 million redeemable convertible preference shares (RCPS) that was issued by BND to UEM Group, said UEM Sunrise in its filing with Bursa Malaysia today. UEM Sunrise (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 2.6) said the RCPS will be automatically converted into ordinary shares upon its maturity on Nov 27, 2015 if they are not redeemed, resulting in UEM Group having a direct stake in BND. Imperia Building\\u2019s selling price represents a 4.2% premium to the market value of RM124.8 million, as appraised by Knight Frank Malaysia Sdn Bhd, said UEM Sunrise in a filing with Bursa Malaysia this evening. UEM Sunrise expects to have RM16.2 million in disposal gain, which will be reflected in its earnings for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2015.

The purchase consideration of US$120 million would be settled with US$90 million in cash and the issuance of ringgit-denominated bonds equivalent to US$30 million in nominal value. Daya Materials (fundamental: 0.55; valuation: 0.9) added that it has so far secured US$80 million in borrowings from a financial institution to fund the majority of the purchase, while the balance will be paid with funds generated internally. In a statement today, the oil and gas (O&G) offshore services provider said that the acquisition will enhance the group\\u2019s operating cost, which will see a positive growth in its earnings. Its group chief executive officer Datuk Lim Thean Shiang said the acquisition cost had been renegotiated down to US$120 million from US$140 million, and by purchasing the said vessel, which save roughly US$9.8 million per year in operating costs. Other than that, the group added shareholders have approved the disposal of 50% stake in 70%-owned Daya CMT Sdn Bhd, as part of the Daya Materials\\u2019 strategy to dispose of non-core assets in order to focus on being a full-fledged O&G player.

Lysaght Galvanized Steel Bhd managing director Liew Hoi Foo was re-elected as a board member during the company's annual general meeting (AGM) today. The AGM has been closely watched amid a perceived family and board tussle over the control of Lysaght (fundamental: 1.95; valuation: 2.4).

It was reported that the corporate exercises included a share split and bonus issue. Today, Chew refuted rumours of a family tussle over Lysaght. In a press statement, Chew said contradicting views were normal in a business.

The announcement was made in reference to news reports by The Malaysian Insider, The Edge and MalaysiaKini, quoting Tadmax\\u2019s (fundamental: 0.6; valuation: 0.9) previous statement on June 24, that the sale price of the Pulau Indah land at RM21.80 psf was supported by a valuation carried out by an independent valuer, Azmi & Co, and subjected to approval by the Valuation Department of the SC. Loss-making Shell Refining Co (Federation of Malaya) Bhd expects its major shareholder Shell Overseas Holdings Ltd \\u2014 which holds a 51% stake \\u2014 to decide whether to sell its stake or convert its refinery in Port Dickson, Negri Sembilan, in the \"next few months\". According to its chairman Iain John Lo, Shell Refining hopes to arrive at the decision \"soon\" as it has a RM450 million debt to be paid by Dec 31, 2015, which was originally due on June 15, 2015. To recap, the heavily-indebted Shell Refining had in 2010 obtained the RM450 million loan to be used as working capital, in which it is required to repay its interest payment via a 20 quarterly installment and a \"bullet repayment\" that was matured on June 15, 2015, but subsequently extended to Dec 31, 2015 after intense negotiations. Diversified group Berjaya Corp Bhd (BCorp) has registered a bigger net loss for its fourth financial quarter ended April 30, 2015 (4QFY15) at RM274.97 million, from RM250.45 million a year ago. The wider net loss was due to the non-cash impairment in value of goodwill relating to the gaming cash generating units. Revenue for the quarter also saw a decrease of 5.93% to RM2.33 billion from RM2.47 billion in 4QFY14, to which the group attributed to the deconsolidation of revenue from Berjaya Auto Bhd. Nonetheless, BCorp (fundamental: 0.9; valuation: 2) posted a net profit of RM861.8 million in FY15 ended April 30, compared with a net loss of RM148.92 million in FY14. The improvement was attributed to higher profit from its motor distribution business, and the restaurants and cafes business mainly from Berjaya Starbucks. Revenue was up 9.96% in FY15 to RM9.6 billion from RM8.73 billion a year ago. The group attributed the increase to the consolidation of revenue from motor distribution segment HR Owen\\u2019s 12-month results versus the 6-month consolidated results in the previous financial year. The group declared a final 1% single-tier dividend per share. In a separate filing, the group proposed for the disposal of 100% stake in Berjaya Environmental Engineering (Foshan) Co Ltd. BCorp said it had entered into a share transfer agreement with Foshan City Nanhai Grandblue Solid Waste Treatment Holding Co Ltd for the disposal which was priced at RMB126.75 million cash, or RM76.68 million. The proceeds from the proposed disposal will be utilised for working capital. BCorp expects the proposed disposal to be completed by third quarter of 2015. O&G offshore support services (OSV) provider Yinson Holdings Bhd saw its net profit for the first quarter ended April 30, 2015 (1QFY16) fall 65.51% to RM10.45 million or 1.01 sen per share from RM30.3 million or 3.19 sen per share a year ago, on foreign exchange (forex) losses from unfavourable currency fluctuations. Yinson's (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 1.5) forex loss widened to RM10.64 million compared to RM3.81 million a year ago due to appreciation of Malaysia ringgit against the US dollar. On top of that, it also suffered a RM2.85 million realised loss on derivatives and a RM10.22 million fair value loss on derivatives. Revenue for the quarter came in at RM256.6 million, 12.74% lower compared to RM294.07 million in the last corresponding quarter. Despite the challenging global economic environment, Yinson said it will strive to end the year on a positive note. Integrated environmental engineering and technology provider Cypark Resources Bhd posted a net profit of RM14.55 million or 7.31 sen per share in the first quarter ended April 30, 2015 (2QFY15), up 6.6% compared to 13.65 million or 7.6 sen per share a year ago. Cypark (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 2.4) attributed the better earnings to the additional income generated from the landscaping and infrastructure and maintenance divisions. Revenue rose 5.85% to RM72.95 million, compared to RM68.92 million a year earlier, according to its filing to Bursa Malaysia today. Going forward, Cypark plans to continue to optimise its business models and commercial processes and the board of directors is of the opinion that the business and performance of the group is expected to be robust and strong for coming year. Water related products manufacturer George Kent Bhd announced that net profit rose 53% to RM9.87 million in the first quarter ended April 30, 2015 (1QFY16) from RM6.47 million a year earlier driven by lower cost at its water meter and construction divisions. In its quarterly results released to the exchange today, George Kent (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 1.4) said revenue dropped to RM59.03 million from RM64.86 million. The group said it would continue to expand its order book, and enhance efficiency and productivity at its factories. Meanwhile, group chairman Tan Sri Tan Kay Hock told reporters after the group\\u2019s annual general meeting today that George Kent\\u2019s order book currently stands at slightly over RM1 billion, which could last the company for two years from now. He said the group aims to grow its order book by between RM2 billion and RM3 billion in FY16 from a tender book of about RM10 billion. Tan explained that George Kent is bidding for water and healthcare infrastructure projects, and also railway projects. He added that the group is also bidding for some of the packages for the Mass Rapid Transit 2 (MRT2) project. Telecommunication software services provider cum property developer Nexgram Holdings Bhd saw its fourth quarter ended Apr 30, 2015 (4QFY15) net profit shrink 77.4% to RM2.08 million from RM9.19 million a year ago, on higher operating expenses and tax. Consequently, the group\\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) fell to 0.14 sen, from 0.97 sen. In its quarterly report to Bursa Malaysia, Nexgram (fundamental: 2.1; valuation: 1.7) posted a revenue of RM19.34 million for 4QFY15, down 12.9% from RM22.18 million in 4QFY14, mainly due to the decrease in sales of the group\\u2019s products and services. Cumulatively, Nexgram\\u2019s FY15 net profit was halved to RM6.98 million, from RM14.28 million in FY14, even though revenue rose 32.6% to RM135.34 million from RM102.07 million in FY14 due to revenue generated from the acquisition of Sensorlink Group.

We expect the China vinyl operation to continue to post losses, albeit lower q-o-q.\nWhile Top Glove\\u2019s share price has fallen 19% since March this year, the stock lacks rerating catalysts. Its 3Q results could fall short of consensus and an earnings rebound is unlikely to materialise over the next three to six months, especially since the group has yet to adjust its average selling prices to reflect the 19% gas tariff hike effective May 1. Margins, as such, remain under pressure.\nWe understand that Top Glove has secured two reputable customers for the new nitrile lines it added last year. Overall plant utilisation stands at approximately 73% and the utilisation rate of its nitrile lines is in excess of 80% (optimal: 90%).\nTop Glove has delayed the commencement of its factory 27 (Phase 2) and 29 by at least six months. The commencement dates have been moved to July and December this year respectively, and total annual capacity will be lifted by just 5%. Management attributed this to a construction delay and its intention to match market demand in order to avoid an oversupply situation.\nTop Glove\\u2019s gross margin for nitrile gloves stands at around 20% presently, representing a fall of five percentage points from a year ago. However, it is still above latex gloves\\u2019 gross margins of 15% to 18%.\nOver the next two years, we think the margin premium enjoyed by nitrile gloves could diminish and match latex gloves, considering the incoming new nitrile capacity and limited expansion within the latex segment.\nWe maintain our earnings forecasts, which project a flattish earnings per share growth of 4% for FY15 and 2% for FY16 as we expect the erosion in margin to crimp the higher sales volume (FY15: +10% and FY16: 11%). Our earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation margin assumptions are 12.1% for FY15 and 11.7% for FY16 (FY13: 13.3%), in view of intensifying competition in the nitrile segment ahead. Nitrile glove made up around 23% of total sales volume in 2QFY14.\nIn view of its unexciting prospective earnings and limited catalysts, we peg Top Glove at -1 standard deviation to mean price-earnings ratio of 15 times (from 17 times) to derive our new target price of RM4.70 (from RM6.).

Its simple moving averages (MA) depict a marginal uptrend for their daily, weekly and monthly charts.

With the very obvious bearish divergence signals on its indicators, there would be greatly diminished chances of upside for the index currently. For now, the index could be range bound between 1,860 and 1,889 points. Despite the mixed tone for the\\u00a0 KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Seal Inc Bhd. Seal announced its\\u00a0 results for the third quarter ended May of financial year 2014 (3QFY14). The group\\u2019s revenue and profit-before-tax for the nine months of FY14 rose almost 100% and 280% respectively. The significant improvement in profitability was attributed mainly to the property development segment, while the profitability of the other segments was softer. According to the results announcement, management expects continued improvement in the group\\u2019s performance in the final quarter of 2014. A check of Bloomberg consensus reveals that no research houses cover Seal. The stock is currently trading at a very attractive historical price-earnings ratio of 2.85 times as well as a fair price-to-book value of 0.99 times. Looking at the reported shareholding changes on Bloomberg, no major acquisitions and disposals of shares were reported recently. Seal\\u2019s chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly timeframes is up. Its share price made an obvious surge since its daily Wave-2 low of\\u00a0 51 sen on Dec 26, 2013. Since that 51 sen low, Seal has surged to its recent June 2014 high of 93 sen. Seal\\u2019s chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to its recent June 2014 high of\\u00a0 93 sen. As it broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of\\u00a0 77 sen and 86 sen, look to buy Seal on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term uptrends for this stock. The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD, Stochastic and Oscillator) are very strong and now depict the firm indications of SEAL\\u2019s eventual move towards much higher levels. It would attract very firm buying activities at the support levels of\\u00a0 77 sen, 86 sen and 90.5 sen. We expect Seal to attract minor profit-taking towards its resistance levels of RM1.02, RM1.11 and RM1.38. Its upside targets are located at RM1.01, RM1.36 and RM1.58.

In general, purer upstream players enjoyed strong year-on-year (y-o-y) earnings on higher crude palm oil (CPO) average selling prices (ASP). The spot price was up 16% y-o-y, 7% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q), and there was stronger fresh fruit bunch (FFB) output for some. Earnings were generally lower q-o-q, largely on a seasonal decline in FFB output. Outperformers were Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KLK), TSH Resources Bhd and Ta Ann Holdings Bhd. KLK\\u2019s outperformance was due to its downstream (mainly oleo chemical) earnings, while TSH enjoyed lower-than-expected cost of production on strong FFB output. As for Ta Ann, its timber division outperformed with stronger log export volume, and higher plywood ASP. Underperformers were Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd (FGV) and TH Plantations Bhd. FGV\\u2019s results were dragged down by poor FFB output and losses at its North American downstream operations, hampered by logistical challenges following the extreme cold weather. TH Plant suffered from higher-than-expected cost of production per tonne. Although still preliminary at this juncture, we see potentially flattish to slightly lower q-o-q upstream earnings in the second quarter of 2014 (2Q14) as the CPO price has retraced from its recent high to RM2,400 per tonne presently (1Q14 spot CPO ASP: RM2,693 per tonne; April to May 2014: RM2,646 per tonne). The recent weakness in price is congruous to our prediction of a weak CPO price outlook of between RM2,400 per tonne and RM2,600 per tonne in May to June 2014 due to concerns over ample global oilseeds supply once the South American harvests hit the global market, and the recently announced planting intention in the United States which favours soybean planting over corn.

The stock is currently trading at a reasonable historical price-earnings ratio of 13.5 times and at a fair price-to-book value ratio of 1.6 times.  Looking at the current reported shareholding changes on Bloomberg, the largest shareholder, Brahim Intl Franchises, sold four million shares to the second largest shareholder Lembaga Tabung Haji on May 12, 2014. Brahim\\u2019s chart trend on the daily and weekly time frames is down. Its share price made an obvious plunge since its daily Wave-5 high of RM2.71 on March 7, 2014. Since that RM2.71 high, the stock declined to its recent June 2014 low of RM1.66. Brahim\\u2019s chart has moved into strong daily and weekly downtrends to its recent June 2014 low of RM1.66. As it broke above its recent key critical support levels of RM2.19 and RM2.06, look to sell Brahim\\u2019s on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to medium term downtrends for this stock.  The daily and weekly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD and Oscillator) are very weak and now depict firm indications of Brahim\\u2019s eventual move towards much lower levels.  We expect Brahim\\u2019s to attract heavy selling towards its resistance levels of RM1.73, RM2.06 and RM2.19. It would attract very weak nibbling activities at the support levels of RM1.36, RM1.54 and RM1.66. Its downside targets are now located at RM1.28 and RM0.90.Lee Cheng Hooi is the regional chartist at Maybank Kim Eng.

Overall for 1Q ended March 31, the research house said the season had been relatively neutral, with 65% of the stocks under its coverage reporting results that were within expectations.  \\u201cPower was the only sector that positively surprised. Sectors that reported both year-on-year (y-o-y) and quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) growth in core earnings were plantation and consumer. \\u201cSectors that saw both y-o-y and q-o-q weaker core earnings were transport (airlines), oil and gas, property (developers), auto, media and glove,\\u201d it said.  The research house noted that disappointing results from the airline sector were due to a still challenging environment, while the auto sector faced lower volume sales and margin compression on higher advertising and promotions as competition heated up.  \\u201cPockets of disappointment in the consumer-related sector came from weaker consumer sentiment [volume sales were down] and poorer advertising expenditure sentiment [in the] media [sector],\\u201d said Maybank IB.  Among big cap stocks under Maybank IB\\u2019s coverage, whose earnings surprised on the upside were Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd, Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd, YTL Power International Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd. Stocks that negatively surprised were Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS), AirAsia X Bhd (AAX), Bumi Armada Bhd, Guinness Anchor Bhd, Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd and Dialog Group Bhd.

At 11:35am, shares of the O&G services provider rose 4 sen or 5.2% to 79.5 sen with some 20.4 million shares traded. A dealer told theedgemalaysia.com that the report by Maybank could have been the trigger for stock\\u2019s heavy trades this morning. \\u201cMaybank\\u2019s report may have been the reason behind the stock\\u2019s heavy trades today,\\u201d he said. He said that the balance sheet of the stock was looking better and added that the potential catalysts for the future that Maybank listed were strong reasons for trading the stock. Maybank IB Research analysts Liaw Thong Jung and Ivan Yap said in a note today that two clear catalysts had emerged for the company. On its first catalyst, the analysts said that the company stands to benefit from its direct proxy relationship to the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) project in Johor. \\u201cWith seven major RAPID tenders worth RM60billion in the pipeline, we estimate KNM has an addressable bid size of RM12 billion-RM18 billion (over a 4-year period) for process equipment\\u2026. KNM\\u2019s potential new orders of RM3.0 billion-RM4.5 billion from a single project (RAPID) would improve its annual orderbook by 50%,\\u201d they said. Secondly, the analysts expressed confidence in KNM\\u2019s ability to provide closure to its biomass project with Peterborough Renewable Energy Limited (PREL) in UK to develop a biomass and waste recycling centre, a project the company has clinched since 2010. \\u201cExecuting Peterborough is a strong catalyst. Our calculation suggests that KNM could consistently generate RM40 million-RM50 million in net profit per annum from FY17, based on a 10% internal rate of return and 80% equity stake, over a 25 year concession period. With its financial position now strengthened, the project is now a step closer to achieving financial closure.\\u201d Meanwhile, MIDF Research reiterated its Neutral rating on the stock with a target price of 77 sen. Analyst Aaron Tan of MIDF said: \\u201cWe are reaffirming this call in this report, as we are not making any more changes to our earnings forecasts. \\u201cThe target price is based on an earnings per share of 4.8sen and price earnings ratio (PER) of 16 times. Our target PER of 16 times is based on KNM\\u2019s 10-year historical average PER and MIDF\\u2019s PER target for small-mid cap oil and gas service providers,\\u201d he said. Tan added that he is positive on the Peterborough project and optimistic that KNM stands a good chance in clinching a slice of the pie from Pengerang."}, "22": {"date_posted": "4/6/2014", "title": "Market Focus: Malaysian equities valuation not compelling, but funds are in market", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR (June 4): AllianceDBS Research Sdn Bhd says current Malaysian equity valuations are not compelling, but local and foreign institutional funds are supporting the market. \\u201cAlthough the benchmark FBMKLCI was largely flat at +0.3% YTD vs +3.1% for MSCI Asia ex Japan, Malaysian equity valuations are not compelling\\u00a0 with forward PE valuation of 16.3x higher than its historical mean of 14x,\\u201d the research house said in a special market focus report today. It observed that as liquidity remained flushed in the system, there was strong buying support by domestic institutional funds. \\u201cWith dissipating concerns over QE tapering and brighter economic prospect for Malaysia\\u2026foreign equity flows have turned positive again over the past two months (April: +RM0.7 billion, May: +RM3.1 billion),\\u201d said the research house. \\u201cThis is likely to provide further support to Malaysian equities going forward,\\u201d added AllianceDBS. However, there are still risks ahead. The key risk for Malaysian equities is corporate earnings disappointment amid rising inflationary pressure, declining consumer sentiment, and slow household income growth. The research house noted that although results in the first quarter of 2014 were mostly in line, negative earnings surprises outweighed positives by 3 to 1, weighed down by glove (temporary production disruptions), and oil & gas (execution issues) sectors. Due to this, AllianceDBS has adjusted FBMKLCI earnings for CY14 and CY15 by +1.6% and -0.2%, respectively, leading to growth moderating from 9.7% to 7.8% for CY15 \\u201cdue to higher base in CY14\\u201d. On stock recommendations, the research house says it favours growth stocks with strong execution track record, stocks with M&A (mergers and acquisitions) and restructuring themes. \\u201cOil & gas and construction remain the favoured sectors for growth theme,\\u201d it said. On oil & gas and construction sectors, the research house advised investors to be more selective as valuation was no longer cheap though growth prospects remained promising given sizeable secured orderbooks and positive newsflows ahead. Within oil & gas sector, SapuraKencana and Dayang Enterprise were given special mention in the report. For construction, the research house\\u2019s picks are IJM Corporation Bhd, Gamuda Bhd and MMC Corporation Bhd. \\u201cWe have neutral views on other sectors except for property, which remains as underweight given expectation of slowing property sales amid government\\u2019s cooling measures,\\u201d it said. In the research report, aviation sector has been upgraded from underweight to neutral as previous concerns on a delay in the opening of klia2 was unfounded, with the new airport terminal opening as scheduled on 2 May with limited hiccups. \\u201cWe expect low cost carriers\\u2019 yield to improve in the 2H driven by stronger pricing power following its move to klia2. The potential restructuring of MAS could also alleviate pressure on yield as we expect capacity rationalisation to be part of the exercise.\\u201d Consumer sector has been upgraded from underweight to neutral as current valuations have largely priced-in weak consumer sentiment and inflationary pressure. Although glove sector has been downgraded from overweight to neutral due to stiffer competition and slower expansion plan in the first quarter, the research house says it is optimistic that the glove sector will deliver decent earnings growth (high single digit if not low teens) in 2014, underpinned by lower latex cost, weaker ringgit against US dollar and disciplined capacity expansion by market leaders. Seeing that banks will benefit from an imminent interest rate uptick expected in July, AllianceDBS said banks with higher variable rate loans (except for AMMB) and strong current accounts/savings accounts or CASA base (Maybank, CIMB, Public Bank and HLB) should benefit if interest rate is raised, \\u201cWe like Public Bank for its defensive and consistent deliverables\\u2026. We also like HLFG and RHBC for opportunities to unlock value through restructuring and balance sheet optimisation.\\u201d On small/mid cap growth stocks, AllianceDBS advises investors to be selective and focus on those with strong fundamentals with clear earnings visibility. \\u201cWithin the small / mid cap space, we like MKH and TSH Resources\\u2026We also like Padini,\\u201d it said. For M&A and structural change play, the research house favours Bursa Malaysia, which it says will benefit from a revamp in fee and cost structure. It also likes TA Enterprise, which is expected to be re-rated if it sells its stockbroking business."}, "23": {"date_posted": "4/6/2014", "title": "Analysts bullish about plantation, banking, construction, property stocks", "article": " KUALA LUMPUR: Sectors that will lead the earnings outperformance this year will be plantation, banking, construction and property, said analysts, following a \\u201cdisappointing\\u201d first-quarter 2014 earnings season. Despite the strong first-quarter gross domestic product growth of 6.2%, the March results season was another disappointment with earnings misses coming from across the board including telecommunications, oil and gas (O&G) and banking sectors, said CIMB Research in a report yesterday. Due to the earnings disappointments, the research firm has cut its 2014 earnings per share growth to 8.2% from 10.4% three months ago.  \\u201cThe 2014 EPS growth will be anchored by the plantation and banking sectors, while the chemicals and O&G sectors will provide the upside,\\u201d it said.

RHB Research Institute Sdn Bhd deemed the March quarter reporting season as \\u201cunexciting\\u201d, downgrading its earnings estimates to a growth of 3.7% and 8.7% for 2014 and 2015 respectively. It is reiterating its end-2014 KLCI target of 1,940 points, adding that it continues to like plantation, banking, construction, property and Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy plays. \\u201cWe expect downside to the market to be limited, given the high liquidity in the market and corrections will likely be shallow. We expect rangebound trading in the near term, with market upside in line with earnings growth,\\u201d RHB Research said. For HLIB Research, first-quarter 2014 reporting season was the 13th consecutive quarter of disappointment and has cut its EPS growth for 2014 to 6.6% from 7.7% previously. \\u201cThe number of sectors that disappointed increased to nine (automotive, banks, brewery, conglomerates, construction, gaming, gloves, O&G and transport) from seven,\\u201d it said. \\u201cGiven the lack of fresh catalyst(s), commencement of the month-long World Cup on June 12 (when the market traditionally drifts lower with subdued activities), heightened geopolitical risks and continued disappointing reporting season, we continue to expect the market to remain lacklustre with some downside risk, albeit limited,\\u201d said HLIB Research. It is maintaining its year-end KLCI target at 1,910 points, or 16 times 2015 earnings, prefering stock-specific bargain hunt on weakness with focus on beneficiaries of the budget, Visit Malaysia Year and reforms, as well as growth and values. HLIB Research\\u2019s top picks are Brahim\\u2019s Holdings Bhd, Inari Amertron Bhd, IOI Properties Group Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd, Perdana Petroleum Bhd, Pharmaniaga Bhd, Quill Cap Trust, RHB Capital Bhd, Sapura Kencana Petroleum Bhd, Time Dotcom Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd.

Although the brewery stock has declined 20% after it hit the peak of RM16.28 about a year ago, the share price weakness did not prompt many analysts upgrading their recommendations.  In fact, Carlsberg Brewery (M) Bhd managing director Henrik Juel Andersen (pic) pointed out in last week\\u2019s financial result announcement that the brewery expected market conditions to remain soft this year. However, the group is confident Carlsberg\\u2019s strong involvement in football events would help to spur demand for its brands.  UOB Kay Hian Research has a \\u201chold\\u201d rating on the stock with a target price of RM13.26, implying a price-to-earnings forecast of 20 times and a dividend yield of 4.8%. Carlsberg\\u2019s share price closed at RM12.34 last Friday.  \\u201cDespite its huge price correction of more than 30% from the peak in May 2013, we believe it is still too early to revisit Carlsberg as the stock lacks near-term catalysts. Entry price is RM11.50,\\u201d it said in a note.  \\u201cLooking ahead, we forecast flattish total industry volume trend in Malaysia, reflecting domestic consumption slowdown amid rising inflationary pressure. We expect margins to remain stable as higher operating cost will be mitigated by minor price hikes since early March 2014,\\u201d it added.  For the first quarter ended March 31, Carlsberg posted a net profit of RM52.33 million, a slight 3.5% increase from the net profit of RM50.53 million in the previous corresponding period, mainly due to contributions from domestic operations.  Group revenue for the quarter decreased to RM445.93 million, from RM470.76 million a year ago. Earnings per share were 17.12 sen versus 16.53 sen a year ago. Affin Research analyst Mandy Teh begs to be differ, saying that with Carlsberg\\u2019s earnings falling within expectations, it continued to be \\u201cliked\\u201d for its attractive dividend yield of 5%, strong management and healthy fundamentals.  \\u201cKey risks would be an off-budget excise duty hike for the brewery sector, a sharper-than-expected slowdown in Singapore\\u2019s liquor consumption, following the 25% hike in liquor excise and a stronger-than-expected surge in contraband products,\\u201d she said. Affin has maintained its \\u201cadd\\u201d call with a revised target price of RM14, from RM13.95 previously.  TA Securities Research maintained its \\u201csell\\u201d rating on the stock, but it raised its target price to RM12.17 from RM11.98 previously.

The index\\u2019s daily signals are mostly positive, with upbeat DMI, Oscillator, CCI and Stochastic readings. Its MACD is currently negative though. As such, the index\\u2019s obvious support levels are seen at the 1,802, 1,862 and 1,876 levels, while the resistances of 1,878 and 1,882 and all-time high of 1,889 may offer some key profit-taking activities.  Should the index surpass 1,889.47, we will move to the next upside target of 1,918 for the KLCI. Its simple moving averages depict an uptrend for its daily, weekly and monthly charts, albeit with very obvious bearish divergence signals. Due to its positive chart signals, we believe investors may adopt a \\u201cNibble on Dips\\u201d tone for the KLCI.  Despite the better tone for the KLCI for now, we are recommending a chart \\u201csell\\u201d on Muhibbah Engineering Bhd, which is expected to announce its results for the first quarter ended March 31 of financial year 2014 (1QFY14) soon. The group\\u2019s 4QFY13 revenue was lower 27% year-on-year (y-o-y) but it reported a higher profit after tax (PAT) of RM115 million from a loss of RM61 million y-o-y.  The lower revenue was due to delivery of major construction projects in the previous year, while the higher PAT was due to a full provision on the remaining amount receivable from the Asia Petroleum Hub project in the previous year. A check of Bloomberg consensus reveals that five research houses have coverage on Muhibbah with \\u201cbuy\\u201d calls. The stock is currently trading at a reasonable historical price-earnings ratio of 14 times and at a high price-to-book value ratio of 2.1 times. Looking at the current reported shareholding changes on Bloomberg, we observe that no major buying or selling was transacted in the month of May 2014. Muhibbah\\u2019s chart trend on the daily time frame is much weaker. Its share price made an obvious plunge since its daily Wave-5 high of RM3.04 on April 18, 2014. Since that RM3.04 high, it declined to its recent May 2014 low of RM2.62. Muhibbah\\u2019s chart has moved into a strong daily downtrend to its recent May 2014 low of RM2.62. As it broke above its recent key critical support levels of RM2.93 and RM2.82, look to sell Muhibbah on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to medium-term downtrends for this stock.  The daily indicators (such as the CCI, DMI, MACD and Oscillator) are very weak and now depict the firm indications of Muhibbah\\u2019s eventual move towards much lower levels. We expect Muhibbah to attract heavy selling towards its resistance levels of RM2.79, RM2.82 and RM3.04. It will attract very weak nibbling activities at the support levels of RM2.39, RM2.62 and RM2.74. Its downside targets are now located at RM2.62, RM2.44 and RM2.22.

The banking group reported a 6.33% rise in net profit to RM1.6 billion for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014 (1QFY14) from RM1.51 billion a year ago, on enhanced performance in its consumer and international businesses as well as continued cost management initiatives under its strategic cost management programme. \\u00a0  Revenue was also up 2.96% to RM8.36 billion from RM8.12 billion in 4QFY13. Maybank\\u2019s earnings per share came in at 18.09 sen compared with 17.87 sen. In a statement yesterday, Maybank chairman Tan Sri Megat Zaharuddin Megat Mohd Nor said 1QFY14 results came in relatively softer for the group in the face of continued economic uncertainties in the global market.   \\u201cThe impact, however, is cushioned off by our well-diversified regional footprint and strong consumer franchise, which enabled us to sustain a steady pace of growth in the quarter,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWith our new regional organisational structure now firmly in place, we expect to see stronger momentum in our earnings for the rest of 2014, and remain focused on achieving the targets set for the year, among them being a return on equity of 15% and group loans growth of 13%,\\u201d said Maybank group president and chief executive officer Datuk Abdul Farid Alias (pic) in the statement. He added that in its efforts to sustain business growth, the group will continue to deepen its business portfolio region-wide, improve client interface, especially in the global banking segment, as well as promote more cross-border banking solutions.  \\u201cWe will do this while also maintaining rigorous risk management oversight to manage any volatility in the operating environment,\\u201d Abdul Farid said. The group\\u2019s community financial services (CFS) saw its pre-tax profit surge 14.9% year-on-year (y-o-y) to a record RM954.2 million, while international operations saw pre-tax profit rise 6.7% to RM703.2 million compared with a year earlier. \\u201cThese helped mitigate the softening in corporate banking businesses, particularly in the two key home markets of Malaysia and Indonesia as a result of a more subdued operating environment,\\u201d said Maybank. The group\\u2019s global banking division faced a challenging quarter. It saw net income dip 11.1% to RM1.22 billion from a year earlier, while corporate banking loans declined 17.1% y-o-y, mainly owing to corporates de-gearing in expectation of an imminent interest rate increase. The group booked a 2.4% y-o-y rise in net income, supported by a 7.6% increase in fund-based income, on the back of a 13.9% y-o-y growth in group loans led by Islamic financing, which grew 36.8%. Income growth was also supported by international banking activity which posted a 5.4% y-o-y rise on the back of positive loans growth in Singapore, Indonesia, China and the Philippines. On an annualised basis, group loans growth for 1QFY14 was 5.3%, with international operations showing a 15.3% increase, while Malaysian operations registered a marginal decline of 0.7%. \\u201cThis was mainly owing to some corporates which moved their funding sources from the domestic to international market, based on their requirements as well as to leverage the more competitive pricing options. \\u201cAmong the main beneficiaries in this movement was the group\\u2019s offshore banking unit, Maybank International Labuan Ltd, where a significant portion of the loans were booked,\\u201d said the group. Fee-based income, however, contracted 8.3% y-o-y mainly due to a decline in investment banking and treasury activities in the quarter.

But then we decided that perhaps it\\u2019s something that we will look into in the future, rather than now,\\u201d said Hassan in an interview with\\u00a0The Edge Financial Daily. \\u201cThe name itself [risk service contract] says it\\u2019s not a bed of roses,\\u201d he added. Rather, Hassan said Bumi Armada will focus on its core competency, that of a floating solutions provider. \\u201cBesides, we are selective because we want to compete on competency, rather than price. We can add tremendous amount of value [to the jobs we procure]. \\u201cOur game is to be selective and create value,\\u201d he added. Bumi Armada can be fastidious with local jobs. Though Hassan said he is keen to partner with Petronas and has done so, Bumi Armada\\u2019s revenue from its Malaysian operations averaged only 22.09% for the past three years. \\u201cWe have operations in 19 countries across five continents. A lot of our revenue comes from Africa, Central Asia, Angola and Brazil,\\u201d he said. Nonetheless, with Malaysia being Bumi Armada\\u2019s backyard, Hassan said the group is a good partner to Petronas and is keen to work with the state-owned giant. \\u201cWe\\u2019re capable and we are financially sound and we can add tremendous value to them. We are keen to work with them,\\u201d he said. Bumi Armada\\u2019s financials for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014 (1QFY14) showed it had a net gearing of 0.86 times, when imputing total borrowings of RM4.55 billion minus cash and cash equivalents worth RM744.22 million. Its total equity stood at RM4.41 billion. Hassan believes that a gearing level of below one times is \\u201cprudent\\u201d. Thus, to partly fund its capital expenditure (capex) in the coming years, Bumi Armada has opted to make a cash call instead. On Monday, the group announced a combination of rights and bonus issues, in which Bumi Armada is seeking to raise up to RM2.25 billion through the former, largely for its capex programme of RM1.76 billion. Hassan said Bumi Armada will undertake a fleet-renewal programme of a \\u201cpremium level\\u201d in order to meet the requirements of the international markets. \\u201cSome of the vessels are getting older. Today, there is a lot of concern on fuel efficiency and carbon emissions. With the fleet renewal, we come into the market with new requirements, which will most likely be high-end vessels. \\u201cIn the North Sea, for example, there is what is called emission control. If you can\\u2019t satisfy a certain level (of emission level), you can\\u2019t even come in. It\\u2019s the same with Australia, the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil. We need to be a part of this,\\u201d said Hassan. Going forward, he sees Bumi Armada operating a smaller fleet, though it will be of the high-end kind. The group plans to purchase five new vessels this year. Currently, there are 52 vessels in its fleet with 12 earmarked for renewal. \\u201cTo service the industry, we want about 60-plus vessels comprising a mix of vessels, instead of just offshore support vessels (OSVs) to give us more leverage in the market,\\u201d said Hassan. A total of RM80 million has been allocated for its OSV division. Meanwhile, the bulk of the capex portion \\u2013 at RM1.4 billion \\u2013 from its proposed one-for-two rights issue proceeds will be used for its floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) segment. In a report dated May 26, 2014, Maybank IB Research said while there is setback at its OSV operations, the proposed rights issue reflects much optimism on its FPSO division. The research house noted that Bumi Armada had submitted four FPSO bids in Ghana, Mexico, Namibia and Indonesia. They are worth US$3 billion (RM9.66 billion) in capex and there are six more bids in the pipeline with capex of US$10 billion. Maybank has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on Bumi Armada at RM3.90, with a target price of RM4.55. This indicates a 25% upside on its closing price of RM3.64 yesterday.

According to sources, the Ministry of Transport recently received an expression of interest from several businessmen. Talk is rife that they include tycoon Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Al-Bukhary, Tan Sri Ahmad Johan, the Airod Sdn Bhd president, and Indonesian billionaire Peter Sondakh, the founder and owner of PT Rajawali Corp. However, it was not clear whether they are looking to buy the whole airline, certain business units of the airline or its aircraft. It was earlier reported that MAS may be considering spinning off its non-core business divisions such as MAS Engineering. Apart from its maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) division, the national airline also operates MASkargo Sdn Bhd. The airline has 151 aircraft in its fleet with an average age of 4.35 years as at end-2014. Sources told The Edge Financial Daily yesterday that it would make sense for Ahmad to buy MAS\\u2019 MRO business unit as it would complement Airod\\u2019s strength as a one-stop aircraft maintenance facility.  Airod is a subsidiary of National Aerospace & Defence Industries Sdn Bhd, which has a 50.99% stake in hybrid airline Malindo Airways Sdn Bhd. Ahmad has one share and Indonesian tycoon Rusdi Kirana has another share while PT Lion Group holds the remaining 48.99% equity interest. In a report dated April 16, Maybank IB Research aviation analyst Mohshin Aziz said MAS Engineering is the most profitable business within MAS, valuing it at RM2.03 billion. Mohshin believes that now is a good opportunity to take it private to resolve legacy issues, among other things. \\u201cSince 2002, the business turnaround plans have not been fruitful. Despite five new chief executive officers and two capital raisings, MAS continues to record big losses. Therefore, a new style of doing things should be explored. If there was ever an inclination to privatise, this is the best time ever to do so,\\u201d he said. For the financial year ended Dec 31, 2013 (FY13), the airline operation recorded a loss of RM829 million, while its cargo services posted a profit of RM5.4 million. Its other businesses, which include catering, engineering and terminal charges, saw a profit of RM54 million. Revenue for FY13 stood at RM13.9 billion for the airline operation, RM1.9 billion for cargo services and RM141.8 million for other businesses. Last Thursday, MAS posted its biggest straight quarterly net loss of RM443.39 million for the first quarter (1Q) ended March 31, some 59% more than the RM278.83 million it recorded in the same period last year. Analysts are expecting larger losses for 2QFY14, given potentially lower yields and passenger load factor as well as higher operational costs.  At yesterday\\u2019s close, the stock recovered one sen to 16.5 sen, after plunging to a new low of 15.5 sen on Monday, which saw RM584 million wiped off its market capitalisation. This follows a report by the Wall Street Journal last week quoting Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak that bankruptcy may be an option to allow the national carrier to restructure. Reports later clarified that Najib had not specifically suggested the possibility of bankruptcy to save loss-making MAS, but that he had acknowledged that \\u201cdifferent modalities\\u201d have been suggested to save the airline from its problems.

The index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (May 2013) and it represented an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cFlat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cPseudo-Bull\\u201d rise completed. The index\\u2019s price movements in the next few months following May 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69 (high) and 1,802.88 (low). The index\\u2019s daily signals are all positive, with upbeat DMI, Oscillator, CCI, MACD and Stochastic readings. As such, its obvious support levels are seen at the 1,802, 1,853 and 1,879 levels, while the resistance and all-time high of 1,882 may offer some token profit-taking activities. Should the index surpass 1,882.20, we believe a move to the next two upside targets of 1,888 and 1,918 for the KLCI may be possible. Its simple moving averages depict an uptrend for its daily, weekly and monthly charts, albeit with very obvious bearish divergence signals. Due to its positive chart signals, we believe investors would adopt a \\u201cnibble on dips\\u201d tone for the KLCI. Due to the KLCI\\u2019s better tone for now, we are recommending a chart \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Mitrajaya Holdings Bhd, which is expected to announce its results for the first quarter ended March 31 of financial year 2014 (1QFY14) at the end of May. As for its 4QFY13 results, the group\\u2019s revenue increased significantly by 39.1% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM123.8 million from RM89.0 million in 4QFY12. Its profit before tax also rose correspondingly by 40.6% y-o-y to RM19.4 million from RM13.8 million in 4QFY12. The higher profitability was attributed to overall improvement in all its divisions, mainly construction, property development and healthcare. Going forward, Mitrajaya\\u2019s order book rose to RM889.8 million after it secured a RM427.9 million building project from Putrajaya Holdings Sdn Bhd at the end of 2013. A check of Bloom\\u00adberg consensus reveals that no research house covers Mitrajaya. The stock is currently trading at a low historical price-earnings ratio of 11.6 times and at a fair price-to-book value ratio of 1.01 times. Looking at the current reported shareholding changes on Bloomberg, we observed that no major buying or selling was transacted by its top 30 shareholders recently. Mitrajaya\\u2019s chart trend looks very strong. Its share price made an obvious rise since its weekly Wave-2 low of 43 sen in August 2013. Since that 43 sen low, it surged to its recent May 2014 high of 87.5 sen. Mitrajaya\\u2019s chart has moved into strong daily, weekly and monthly downtrends to its recent May 2014 high of 87.5 sen. As it broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of 65 sen and 74 sen, look to buy Mitrajaya on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to medium term uptrends for this stock. The daily indicators (such as the CCI, DMI, MACD, Stochastic and Oscillator) are very firm and now depict firm indications of Mitrajaya\\u2019s eventual move towards much higher levels. We expect the company to attract heavy buying towards its support levels of 65 sen, 74 sen and 86 sen. It will attract minor profit-taking activities at the resistance levels of 87.5 sen, 91 sen and RM1.10. Its upside targets are now located at 91 sen, RM1.17, RM1.22 and RM1.45.

While the demerger has boosted its non-gaming entity MPHB Capital Bhd, evident from its share price gain of 42.33% since the exercise was completed in June 2013, the same can\\u2019t be said for Magnum. Magnum appears to have fallen out of favour with investors since the demerger, shedding 9.3% from the time it reached its peak of RM3.33 on Aug 13, 2013, to last Wednesday. The share price currently hovers between RM2.95 and RM3.05. Analysts say expectations that moderating consumer spending \\u2014 due to rising inflationary pressure \\u2014 will impact sales has contributed to weak sentiment in the counter. The lurking uncertainty as to how the upcoming Goods and Services Tax (GST) will impact number forecasting operators such as Magnum places further pressure on the share price, they add. However, at current levels of about RM3 per share, some analysts opine that Magnum\\u2019s shares have become a good bargain as they offer a dividend yield of 6%. Unsurprisingly, some institutional funds have upped their stake in the gaming operator. \\u201cThere is value in Magnum at this price level \\u2014 all the negative news about GST and rising cost of living has been priced into the share price. The dividend yield is good at 6% and I believe that it is sustainable,\\u201d says CIMB Research analyst Lucius Chong. Magnum declared a fourth interim dividend of five sen per share in its fourth quarter results ended Dec 31, 2013, bringing its total dividend for the year to 20 sen per share. Magnum\\u2019s dividend yield of 6% is more attractive than that of other dividend darlings that investors usually chase after. Based on last Tuesday\\u2019s share price, Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd provides a yield of 4.58%, while Nestl\\u00e9 (M) Bhd\\u2019s is at 3.4% and British American Tobacco (M) Bhd, 4.7%.Some analysts say Magnum could further pay out a special dividend via borrowings, sweetening the investment prospect for investors. This would not be an uncommon move, they note, pointing out that competitor Berjaya Sports Toto Bhd (BToto) had gone down that route previously to pay out dividends. As at Dec 31, 2013, Magnum\\u2019s net gearing stood at 0.24 times. It had total borrowings of RM1.013 billion, consisting of medium-term notes and revolving credit, and RM425.95 million in cash and cash balances. Of 10 analysts that track the stock, six have a \\u201chold\\u201d call on it while the remaining four have a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call, according to Bloomberg data. Their target prices range from RM3.04 to RM3.65. Based on the most bullish target price of RM3.65, by CIMB Research, Magnum\\u2019s shares have an upside potential of 20.86% from its closing price of RM3.02 last Wednesday. Magnum had already touched Maybank Investment Bank Research\\u2019s target price of RM3.04 by mid-Tuesday last week. Maybank IB Research has a \\u201chold\\u201d call on the stock. Following the demerger, MPHB Capital holds the financial services, hospitality and property investment businesses. For the financial year 2013 ended Dec 31, Magnum raked in a profit from its continuing operations \\u2014 gaming and investment holding \\u2014 of RM334.59 million on the back of RM2.991 billion in revenue. Earnings from its continuing operations came in higher by 29.8% compared with the previous year\\u2019s restated continuing operating profit of RM257.71 million, due to a lower prize payout ratio from the gaming division and lower finance cost and operating expenses for the group.The group highlighted that gaming revenue was affected by one less draw during the year, the weaker economic environment and competition from illegal operators, resulting in a decline of RM97.2 million in FY2013 from the previous year. Some analysts are less keen on the stock because they foresee minimal growth in earnings for the coming financial year as consumers cut back on expenses due to the rise in living costs. An analyst with a bank-backed research house says the limited number of game choices under Magnum, consisting of only the 4D jackpot, has also put it at a disadvantage compared with its industry peer BToto. BToto\\u2019s shares currently trade at RM3.89 (as at last Wednesday) and offer a dividend yield of 5% based on its declared dividend as at its cumulative nine-month financial period ended Jan 31, 2014. HwangDBS Research, however, says in its research report that Magnum has successfully held on to its market share of 34% since the second quarter ended June 30, 2013. BToto nevertheless remains the market leader with a 42% market share. \\u201cMagnum\\u2019s numbers forecast operations (NFO) sales are showing signs of stabilising given the company\\u2019s strong following, as the novelty factor for its competitors\\u2019 new 4D jackpot games fade,\\u201d it says. The research house adds that while NFO sales may see an impact from weaker consumer sentiment, the impact will likely be minimal given Magnum\\u2019s small-ticket-item nature and resilient historical track record.

In a note, the research house said it expects only AirAsia Bhd to stay profitable but with reduced figures. Both Malaysian Airlines Systems Bhd (MAS) and AirAsia X Bhd will stay in the loss-making territory. Maybank IB said it is forecasting profit declines for almost all of the low-cost carrier\\u2019s operations in 1QFY14, led by Thailand as its political crisis has undermined air travel. AirAsia, AirAsia X and MAS are expected to release their results on May 20, May 19 and May 15 respectively. On AirAsia, Maybank IB expects the budget carrier to register core net profit of RM135.6 million for 1QFY14. AirAsia\\u2019s Indonesian operation is expected to be affected by the weaker rupiah, while its new operations in the Philippines and India will be incurring operational losses. However, the research house projects profit growth for AirAsia from 2QFY14 onwards, as the Malaysian airfare war has peaked in 4QFY13. \\u201cThe situation has since improved and we noticed that AirAsia\\u2019s published fares are much higher than they were a year ago,\\u201d said the research house.

Maybank IB expects AirAsia X to post a wider core net loss of RM50.1 million for 1QFY14 compared with its profit of RM44.0 million in 1QFY13.

The MH370 incident has negatively impacted the airline\\u2019s reputation and this greatly inhibits its effort to push for higher yields,\\u201d said Maybank IB. Furthermore, the costs relating to the incident have not been clarified, making it difficult to forecast the company\\u2019s earnings for 1QFY14. \\u201cIt is difficult to make earnings forecast for 1QFY14 under the circumstances; we estimate MAS will make a core net loss of RM250-300 million, down from a loss of RM340 million in 1QFY13,\\u201d said the research house.

The price movements in the index in the next few months following May 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69 (high), 1,802.88 (low) and 1,871.69 (high). The index\\u2019s daily signals were mixed, with upbeat CCI, DMI and Oscillator but negative MACD and Stochastic signals. As such, the index\\u2019s weaker support levels were seen at 1,802, 1,821 and 1,853, while the resistance areas of 1,862, 1,871 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some very heavy selling activities. Its simple moving averages depict a neutral trend for its daily chart, which may turn down on some further potential selling. Due to its mixed chart signals, we believe investors will now turn towards a \\u201csell on rallies\\u201d tone for the KLCI. Due to the uncertain tone for the KLCI\\u00a0 for May 2014, we are recommending a chart \\u201csell\\u201d on Yinson Holdings Bhd, which announced its fourth quarter ended Jan 1, 2014 (4QFY14) results in February. The group\\u2019s business units are organised into four operating segments \\u2014 marine, transport, trading and other operations. Its full FY14 profit before tax increased by 81.1% year-on-year to RM80.4 million compared with RM44.4 million in FY13. The increased profitability was attributed to a rise in the marine segment, joint ventures and other operations segment. The higher profit was partly offset by a decrease in contribution from the trading segment due to a drop in gross margin, an increase in net borrowing expenses and share of losses from associates. A check of Bloomberg consensus reveals that five research houses have coverage on the stock. Of the five, three have \\u201cbuy\\u201d calls, one \\u201chold\\u201d and one \\u201csell\\u201d. The stock is currently trading at a high historical price-earnings ratio of 24.6 times and at a very high price-to-book value of 3.9 times. Looking at the current reported shareholding changes on Bloomberg, we observe that its top 30 shareholders did not do any major buying or selling recently. Yinson\\u2019s chart trend on the daily time frame is much weaker. Its share price made an obvious plunge since its daily Wave-5 high of RM9.22 on March 13. Since that RM9.22 high, it declined to its recent May 2014 low of RM7.78. Yinson\\u2019s chart has moved into strong daily downtrends to its recent May 2014 low of RM7.78. As it broke above its recent key critical support levels of RM8.51 and RM8.45, look to sell Yinson on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to medium term downtrends for this stock. The daily indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD and Oscillator) are very weak and now depict the firm indications of Yinson\\u2019s eventual move towards much lower levels. We expect Yinson to attract heavy selling towards its resistance levels of RM7.81, RM8.45 and RM8.51. It will attract very weak nibbling activities at the support levels of RM6.93, RM7.25 and RM7.78. Its downside targets are now located at RM7.25, RM6.90 and RM6.17. Lee Cheng Hooi is the regional chartist at Maybank Kim Eng.

Maybank Investment Bank (Maybank IB) Research said some positive events that have occurred since the beginning of this year have strengthened the pipeline of construction works in the near term as well as in the longer run. They include major construction projects like the RM11 billion Project 3B power plant, the RM1 billion Langat 2 water treatment plant and the go-ahead for the refinery and petrochemical integrated development (Rapid) and the Klang Valley mass rapid transit line 2 (KVMRT 2). \\u201cThe solid pipeline of projects should propel strong replenishment in construction order book, going forward. This should in turn sustain and even support the construction earnings growth momentum,\\u201d Maybank IB Research said in a report on Wednesday.

Maybank IB Research said the total of new construction projects awarded last year were well sustained at RM92.3 billion against RM123.6 billion in 2012, which included the KVMRT 1 project worth RM20 billion. The robust projects in the past few years have driven total construction works completed in 2013 to hit a six-year high of RM90.9 billion. \\u201cDespite the bullishness, stock valuations are still lagging behind the FBM KLCI valuation and below the peak valuations during the previous bull cycle. Hence, we continue to overweight the sector,\\u201d said Maybank IB Research, adding that shares in Gamuda Bhd, IJM Corp Bhd, WCT Bhd and Hock Seng Lee Bhd (HSL) were trading at close to their mean forward price earnings ratio (PER) valuations despite their robust fundamentals, but \\u201cstill below their respective peak valuations during the previous bull cycles.

Secondly, look at small-cap stocks such as Protasco Bhd that is benefiting from other key areas of public infrastructure spending, particularly in public road maintenance and public housing and HSL, which is a good proxy to massive infrastructure spending in Sarawak backed by the Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy, urbanisation and rural development.

The exercise will, however, dilute its earnings per share (EPS) and return on equity (ROE). This was why investors\\u2019 immediate reaction to the news announced on Tuesday was to sell down the shares. The bank\\u2019s share price\\u00a0fell by as much 1.4% to RM19.88, before gaining some ground to close at RM20.14 on Wednesday, just 0.1% lower than the previous day\\u2019s price. The counter was actively traded with some 11.6 million shares changing hands, about 3\\u00bd times more than that in the previous day. \\u201cWhat is positive is that this fundraising would bolster its CET-1 ratio to a comfortable 10.4% thereafter,\\u201d Maybank Investment Bank (Maybank IB) Research said in a note on Wednesday. \\u201cWe estimate the financial impact to be a 7% dilution to financial year 2015 (FY15) EPS and a dilution in the group\\u2019s FY15 return on average equity from [earlier expectations of] 19.1% to 17.7%,\\u201d it said. It maintained its \\u2018sell\\u2019 call and target price of RM18.00 on the stock. CET-1 provides the benchmark on how banks are well-capitalised. Public Bank\\u2019s CET-1 ratio stood at 8.5% as at end-March, much lower than the industry average of over 12.8%, but comfortably above the minimum 7% that banks need to meet by 2019, as per Bank Negara Malaysia\\u2019s (BNM) Basel III requirements. However, BNM is also considering introducing counter-cyclical capital buffers, which may eventually push up the minimum requirement further. Analysts said this may be pushed up by 2.5% at the most. It had been long expected that Public Bank would need to raise funds to boost its\\u00a0capital position and it had hinted to analysts that such a move would be done via a rights issue, as opposed to a private placement of new shares. Bigger rival CIMB Group Holdings Bhd earlier this year opted for a private placement, raising RM3.55 billion to strengthen its capital position. However, analysts were surprised that Public Bank had decided to undertake the rights issue earlier. \\u201cIt comes much earlier than anticipated as the management has often said it would decide only after Bank Negara sets the counter-cyclical buffer in 2015/2016. That management has decided to bring this forward could be to take advantage of the recent spike in share price,\\u201d Maybank IB Research pointed out. Public Bank\\u2019s share price surged to a multi-year high of RM20.80 on April 4, \\u00a0following a four-day uptrend during which it gained 8.6%. The interest came after the bank\\u2019s announcement on March 31 that it would merge its local and foreign shares on April 16, a move which lifted its investible weighting on FTSE\\u2019s Value-Stocks Asean Index. \\u201cWe believe that this is an opportune time to undertake such an exercise given that its share price is riding high which will help to minimise the EPS dilution impact,\\u201d Hong Leong Investment Bank Research said, adding that it was \\u201cneutral to slightly positive\\u201d on the rights issue. Public Bank said the rights issue would be at a discount of 20% to 35% to its theoretical ex-rights price. The exercise is expected to be completed by the third quarter.  Public Bank says the rights issue will be at a discount of 20% to 35% to its theoretical ex-rights price and the exercise is expected to be completed by the third quarter. \\u201cAssuming a price discount of 27% [mid-point between the 20% and 35% discount] and a volume weighted average price of RM19.97, we estimate a 1-for-10 rights issue to raise the RM5 billion,\\u201d Maybank IB Research said. According to Bloomberg data, at least 27 analysts that track Public Bank\\u2019s stock, most of them (15) have a \\u201chold\\u201d, with seven maintaining a \\u2018sell\\u2019 and the rest, a \\u201cbuy\\u201d. Analysts said Public Bank\\u2019s ROE, the highest among local banks, has peaked and is now on a declining trend. Its ROE stood at 20.5% as at March 31. HwangDBS Vickers Research forecast that the group\\u2019s ROE would be around 19% following the rights issue, which it said is still the highest among Malaysian banks. It maintained its \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the stock. \\u201cAfter the rights issue, PBB investors will no longer need to worry about the bank not meeting the Basel III requirements. In addition, its management will be able to focus solely on growing the business,\\u201d it said. The research house expects Public Bank\\u2019s dividend payout ratio (DPR) to stop sliding and assumes that it will be sustainable at 40% up to FY18. The group\\u2019s DPR has been on a declining trend since FY09, slipping to 44.8% last year, its lowest in about a decade.

Most of the investors were new to the stock and were pleasantly surprised to learn of its competitiveness at the Strait of Malacca and the loyalty of its hubbing customers.  Some investors expressed concern on concession risk in view of the ongoing water restructuring saga in Selangor which questions the sanctity of government contracts.  Management does not see a termination risk as Westports has\\u00a0 executed an excellent operating track record, unless the government aims to nationalise the country\\u2019s port assets. Management also reiterated its expectations of container throughput growth of 5% to 10% per annum (low end,if the P3 alliance, comprising CMA CGM Group, Maersk Line and Mediterranean Shipping Co, commences operations in mid-2014) and stable operating margins in financial year 2014 ending Dec 31 (FY14) and FY15.  Westports will release its results for the first quarter ended March 31 (1QFY14) on May 2. We expect Westports to post stronger year-on-year (y-o-y) 1QFY14 net profit (1QFY13: RM93 million) on higher container volume (about +12% y-o-y) and stable margins.  Nevertheless, earnings on a quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) basis may be much lower (4QFY13: RM131 million) on: (i) slightly lower container volume (-3% q-o-q) as throughput is traditionally softer in the first half (1H); and (ii) absence of an exceptionally low effective tax rate (4QFY13: 0.2%). Westports\\u2019 share price has been flattish since its listing in October 2013 due to the P3 overhang. We, however, believe that the impact will be insignificant as CMA CGM will introduce new non-P3 services from 1H of 2014, which will cushion the volume loss (2% of total volume) from P3.

CIMB Group Holdings Bhd's Indonesian unit PT Bank CIMB Niaga Tbk's net profit rose 5% to Rp1.1 trillion in the first quarter ended March 31, 2014, from Rp1.05 trillion a year earlier. CIMB Group said CIMB Niaga's interest income climbed to Rp4.5 trillion from Rp3.89 trillion. Non-interest income was higher at Rp1.16 trillion versus Rp1.12 trillion. CIMB Niaga president director Arwin Rasyid said : \"The year ahead will remain a challenging one for Indonesia's banking industry, with expectations of a better second half compared to the first.\\u201d As at March 31, CIMB Niaga's loan book rose 9.5% to Rp160.96 trillion from a year earlier. Gross non-performing loans ratio rose to 2.57% from 2.41%. Public Bank Bhd has proposed a rights issue of new shares to raise up to RM5 billion. Public Bank said the proceeds would finance the group's working capital needs. \"The proposed rights issue is undertaken as part of the company\\u2019s capital-management strategy to further strengthen its capital position to support the continuous business growth of Public Bank and its subsidiaries. \"The proposed rights issue will also facilitate the building up of an adequate level of capital buffer in preparation for the forthcoming regulatory capital requirements,\" Public Bank said. Public Bank said it had not determined the entitlement and issue price for the rights shares. The group has an issued base of 3.5 billion shares. Public Bank shares closed flat at RM20.16 today. Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) announced that its banking unit in Indonesia, PT Bank International Indonesia Tbk (BII), recorded a net profit plunge of 39% to Rp189 billion for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014. BII attributed this to tight net interest margins (NIM) and provisions for selected corporate debtors. In a statement, BII said the increasing cost of funds and challenging market conditions impacted the bank\\u2019s NIM, which declined to 4.03% from 4.58%. But the bank\\u2019s loans portfolio grew 27% to Rp101.3 trillion, while assets increased 18% to Rp140.1 trillion. The bank said its customer deposits increased 16.5% to Rp104.0 trillion, contributed by a significant increase in savings deposits of 24.7%. It added the loan to deposit ratio remains healthy at 88.91% in the first quarter this year. BII said its total capital increased to Rp15.0 trillion in March this year from Rp12.4 trillion in the previous year. Its capital adequacy ratio with credit, operational and market risk hit 13.29%. Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd\\u2019s (MPI) net profit for its third quarter soared about five times to RM10.5 million from RM1.8 million in the previous year\\u2019s corresponding quarter.

For the nine months to March 31, 2014, net profit skyrocketed to RM36.4 million from RM173,000 in the year before, while revenue rose to RM970.0 million from RM900 million. \\u201cThe significant improvement in profit before tax for the quarter and financial year-to-date was mainly due to higher revenue, higher margin products and appreciation of the US dollar against the ringgit.\\u201d Looking ahead, MPI anticipates its performance will improve further in the final quarter of the financial year. Eversendai Corporation Bhd said it recently secured several contracts for structural steel projects worth RM172.2 million via its subsidiaries in the Middle East and India. The first project is to construct a complex on Dana Island in Doha, Qatar. The construction of the complex is scheduled to be completed by December 2014. The second is a sub-structure contract in Qatar to provide vital connection into Doha\\u2019s Lusail City Development. This new state-of-the-art facility is expected to be completed by January 2015. Eversendai has also secured a contract for a grand mosque located in Al Ain, Abu Dhabi. This project expected to be completed by February 2015. In India, the group has also won a contract for the design and erection of steel for a sky bridge in Kolkata, India. VisDynamics Holdings Bhd\\u2019s executive director and CEO Choy Ngee Hoe, a major shareholder of the firm, did not sell his stake today or yesterday to cause a plunge in share price, said a company executive today. \\u201cChoy did not trade at all. It is the doing of a third party (outside the company),\\u201d the spokesperson for VisDynamics told theedgemalaysia.com over the telephone. The semiconductor specialist firm's price was in focus yesterday after it hit limit down and the firm was subsequently slapped with an unusual market activity (UMA) query by Bursa Malaysia. Today, the stock continued its plunge to hit another limit down in morning trades. At market close, the stock fell 19.5 sen or 41.5% to 27.5 sen. Globetronics Technology Bhd\\u2019s net profit for the first financial quarter ended January 31, 2014, rose 38% to RM14.10 million from RM10.20 million in similar quarter a year ago. Revenue for the quarter had risen to RM83.42 million from RM77.48 million from similar quarter a year ago. The company announced a final single tier ordinary dividend of 4% per RM0.50 share and a single tier special dividend of 4% per share. Atlan Holdings Bhd reported net profit of RM19.3 million for its fourth quarter ended February 28, 2014, up 27% from RM15.1 million in the previous year\\u2019s corresponding quarter. However, revenue for the quarter was slightly lower at RM210.8 million from RM213.6 million a year ago. The group had attributed the higher profit for the quarter to the disposal of a parcel of land and also a reversal of impairment of assets. For the year, net profit improved significantly to RM206.4 million from RM76.0 million in the previous year, while revenue was lower at RM765.6 million compared with RM791.6 million. Going forward, the group expects a challenging year ahead due to the current economic outlook. IRIS Corporation Bhd had entered into a project agreement through its subsidiary, Regal Energy Ltd, for the supply of waste treatment technology and equipment to foreign markets with a total investment cost of RM26.1 million (RMB50.0 million).

In the initial tender, which was slated for award in the first quarter of the year, Barakah and two other parties were shortlisted, but for some reason, a re-tender was called.  \\u201cIt [the re-tendering] should close in the middle of next month, which means the company [Barakah] will know soon after that whether or not its bid was successful,\\u201d an oil and gas official says. It is also worth noting that the existing contract ends by September this year and that the incumbent is also bidding for the job, which could make things difficult for Barakah.  Nevertheless, most analysts view the Saudi contract as significant for Barakah, given that it is worth US$1 billion.  Barakah has a \\u201cfair\\u201d chance of winning the job, says Maybank Investment Bank Research\\u2019s oil and gas analyst Liaw Thong Jung. If the contract, including extensions, materialises, it could be a catalyst for change for the company because it would more than double its existing order book of RM2.3 billion, he adds.  His back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests an additional RM50 million to RM70 million of net profit per annum and potentially a 51% rise in Maybank IB Research\\u2019s target price of RM1.85 for the company\\u2019s stock. UOB Kay Hian says it would re-rate Barakah\\u2019s fair value to between RM2.30 and RM2.50 from the current RM1.70 if it won the Saudi job.  The research house\\u2019s target price of RM1.70 is based on 13 times its forecast fully diluted earnings for Barakah in 2015. However, UOB had in February this year downgraded Barakah to a \\u201chold\\u201d from a \\u201cbuy\\u201d, citing a strengthening in its share price. Barakah hit a high of RM1.87 during the month before easing to current levels. Over the past year, it has gained more than 50%.  As Barakah was shortlisted in the first tender, the likelihood of it being picked again is high, but anything more than that remains conjecture, industry pundits say. \\u00a0  \\u00a0The numbers that analysts have raked up seem quite bullish. In January, Barakah changed its financial year-end from end-September to end-December, which means that the financial year ending Dec 31, 2014, will be 15 months long. In the first three months of FY2014, Barakah registered a net profit of RM3.9 million from RM82.8 million in sales, which translates into earnings per share of 0.64 sen. Maybank IB Research\\u2019s Liaw puts Barakah\\u2019s net profit in FY2014 at RM71.3 million and sales at RM652.6 million. A chunk of the FY2014 net profit is likely to come in the second half of the year, starting June, when the company commences work on the RM1.5 billion T&I job awarded by national oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd late last year. The contract is for the installation of over 300km of pipeline over three-plus-one years. While there has been a slight delay \\u2014 the contract was expected to start contributing from March or April this year \\u2014 oil and gas officials say it is the norm, considering that it is a big job.

The visit also included [email\\u00a0protected] Mall, a joint venture project between WCT Holdings Bhd (70%) and MAHB (30%). The entire site requires some finishing touches and we think it will take another two months before it is 100% ready. Nonetheless, the airport and the shopping mall will be able to commence operations on May 2. Fears of cracks on the runway and apron have been proven unfounded, and the entire site looks wonderful so to speak. We were impressed. Firstly, klia2 (estimated capital expenditure of RM4 billion) is not a low-cost terminal by any sense of the word. It is a fully-equipped terminal with all the functionality and comforts of a world-class airport terminal. Full service carriers will have no problem shifting their operations there, as all the required amenities are available. For the low-cost carriers (LCC), klia2 provides them with a platform for high and uninterrupted growth, with the opportunity to boost their service levels. The klia2 concept puts a high emphasis on retail, so much so that we can agree with its \\u201cairport-within-a-mall\\u201d concept. It has the highest retail floor space composition of any airport globally. There are two elements of retail, the [email\\u00a0protected] Mall and air-side retailers. The combined retail floor space amounts to 67,516m\\u00b2 (35,000m\\u00b2 at air-side and 32,516m\\u00b2 at Gateway), which is almost on par with the entire retail space of all the three terminals at Changi Airport in Singapore. We believe klia2 is a major positive for MAHB and WCT, as both companies will start reaping the fruits of their labour. klia2 is also positive for AirAsia X Bhd (AAX), as it will help to enhance customer experience while the terminal layout will enable AAX to harness on transit passengers more efficiently and cheaply. AirAsia Bhd will also benefit as the terminal provides an uninterrupted platform to grow and enhance its customer experience. During our visit to klia2, it was evident that some cosmetic touch-ups and other construction works were still outstanding. These shortcomings however will not be disruptive to operations and will not hamper the May 2 opening. This is a positive development as we initially forecast Sept 1, 2014 as our base case opening date. Malindo Air will take the honours as the first airline to land at klia2 on May 2 with a flight from Kota Kinabalu landing at 12:05am. Cebu Pacific Air will be the first airline to take off from klia2, via a flight to Manila at 1:30am. We raise our earnings forecast for MAHB for financial year 2014 ending Dec 31 (FY14) by 1.2% to impute the earlier launch date. However, our \\u201csell\\u201d recommendation and target price of RM7.03 are unchanged as our valuation uses FY15 as the base year. The target price is based on 10.3 times 2015 enterprise value/earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, which is a 10% premium to global peers after considering MAHB\\u2019s strong traffic growth potential. The stock is expensive with a high debt burden relative to its peer group. \\u2014 Maybank IB Research, April 28 This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on April 29, 2014."}, "61": {"date_posted": "25/4/2014", "title": "KLCI looking to test 1,870 and 1,882 levels", "article": " NORTH Asia-Pacific stock markets fell slightly yesterday amid reports that China would not meet its official targets for economic expansion.

The index closed at 1,865.28 yesterday, down 2.07 points from Wednesday as blue-chip stocks like Malayan Banking Bhd, Petronas Dagangan Bhd, Petronas Gas Bhd and PPB Group Bhd caused it to inch down on some profit-taking.  The index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (May 2013) and it represented an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cFlat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cPseudo-Bull\\u201d rise completed.

Its simple moving averages depict an emerging uptrend for its daily, weekly and monthly charts. Due to the firmer chart signals, we believe investors will remain on a \\u201cbuy on dips\\u201d mode for the KLCI.  Due to the KLCI\\u2019s fine tone, we are recommending a chart \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Muda Holdings Bhd. The group saw its revenue for full financial year 2013 ended Dec 31 (FY13) decline marginally by 4.6% to RM1.04 billion from RM1.09 billion in FY12. The decline was due to a disposal of a 22.5% equity interest in KL Resources Pte Ltd from the trading division, which was de-recognised.  In spite of this, revenue from its trading division rose 3.3% year-on-year in FY13 compared to FY12. Revenue from the manufacturing division rose 6.4% in FY13 on growth in domestic consumption coupled with improvement in the US and European economies. According to Muda Holdings\\u2019 results announcement, its gross margin was weaker in FY13 due to softer selling prices for paper products. Despite the weaker gross margin, profit before tax rose due to the disposal of the subsidiary mentioned above. A check on Bloomberg consensus reveals that no research house covers the stock. The stock is currently trading at a fair historical price-earnings ratio of 13.9 times and below its price-to-book value (of RM2.62) at 0.75 times. Muda Holdings has a low indicative 12-month dividend yield of 1.52%. Maybank-IB Research first featured chart coverage on the company on Jan 22 at RM1.18. Muda Holdings\\u2019 chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames are very strong. Its share price made an obvious surge since its daily Wave-2 low of 88 sen on Dec 24, 2013. Since that 88 sen low, the company surged to its recent April 2014 high of RM2.00, with an extremely strong symmetrical triangle breakout with high volumes traded on April 23. Muda Holdings\\u2019 chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to its recent April 2014 high of RM2.00. As it broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of RM1.46 and RM1.85, look to \\u201cbuy\\u201d Muda Holdings on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to long term uptrends for this stock.  The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD, Stochastic and Oscillator) are very strong and now depict the firm indications of Muda Holdings eventual move towards much higher levels. We expect Muda Holdings to remain very well sought after on dips towards its support levels of RM1.46, RM1.85 and RM1.96. It may attract minor profit-taking at the resistance levels of RM2.00, RM2.17 and RM2.53. Its upside targets are now located at RM2.13, RM2.31 and RM2.74.

At mid-day market break today, Alam shares fell 9 sen or 5.45% to RM1.56 per share, after falling to a low of RM1.52 earlier. The stock had surged ahead of the news on the entry of new investors. A dealer with a major stock broking firm told theedgemalaysia.com that this could be a near term drop due to speculative trading activities. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a huge discount between the prices paid for the acquisition and its market price currently so the market is following a clich\\u00e9 to buy on rumor and sell on news,\\u201d he said. He added that \"fundamentally nothing is wrong\" with the stock. Yesterday, Alam announced that Quek and Poh were taking up new shares in the company, which accounted for 15.53% of Alam's existing shares, at RM1.35 per share. The subscription price was a huge discount from Alam's last traded price of RM1.65 on Monday. The company said the rationale for the proposed share issuance was to enable the group to raise additional funds without incurring interest expenses. The company also saw this as a move to strengthen its equity base and increase liquidity and marketability.  Despite the fall in stock price, analysts remain bullish on Alam with 3 major stock broking firms maintaining their \\u201cbuy\\u201d calls on the stock today.

RHB Research similarly has maintained its \\u201cbuy\\u201d rating on the stock with a fair value of RM1.96 per share. The research team is positive on the recent transaction, stating that it will cut Alam\\u2019s gross gearings significantly. \\u201cWe view the transaction favourably as we expect it to cut Alam\\u2019s gross gearing to 0.67 times from 1.07 times as per its audited FY12 financial statement.

Maybank reiterates its unchanged \\u201cbuy\\u201d call with a TP of RM1.90 per share. \\u201cOur earnings forecasts and TP are unchanged pending clarity on its fleet expansion program,\\u201d said analyst Liaw Thong Jung of Maybank IB."}, "63": {"date_posted": "23/4/2014", "title": "KLCI\\u2019s bullish momentum gaining strength", "article": " THE market finally rebounded over the past week, in line with the bullish performance in global markets, especially in Western countries.

Crude palm oil declined 0.8% to RM2,682 per tonne. The KLCI continued to stay above the short term 30-day moving average, which is currently at 1,840 points and above the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. The support level is at 1,840 points and as long as the index stays above this level, the trend remains bullish. The immediate resistance remains at 1,880 points and with the current momentum, the index may test this level soon. Momentum indicators such as RSI, MACD and Momentum Oscillator have started to increase in the past week. In addition, the KLCI has gone above the top band of the Bollinger Bands, indicating strong bullish momentum in the short term. This indicates that the market is directionless and therefore in a correction. These indicators show that the market is willing to take higher risks with the overall bullish sentiment. Regional markets may be mixed but the local market is certainly in a bullish mode. The only resistance to beat now is the 1,880-point level and the current momentum shows that this is highly possible. Local institutional funds are beginning to buy again and this will provide the support needed for the KLCI to remain bullish. Furthermore, the close near the high of the trading range in the past week shows strong bullish sentiment. While blue chips may start to rally, penny stocks may take a rest this week.

However, we expect passenger traffic growth to moderate to 10% to 12% for the rest of the year due to the disappearance of flight MH370, which we expect will negatively impact short-term demand and also the effect of a higher base in 2013 (+18.4% y-o-y). Our concerns remain centred on klia2 \\u2014 that is, whether it will match its budget of RM4 billion and whether it will enjoy a higher PSC compared with the current rate charged at the low-cost carrier terminal.

Asiasons\\u2019 co-founder Azlan, joint managing director and co-founder Ng Teck Wah as well as independent director Lee Teck Leng \\u2014 who specialises in criminal litigation and was formerly a deputy public prosecutor in the commercial affairs department (CAD) in Singapore before joining private practice \\u2014 are not seeking re-election and will leave Asiasons\\u2019 board at the conclusion of its annual shareholders\\u2019 meeting on April 28, according to the company\\u2019s AGM notice released on April 10.  News of the impending departures came one week after Singapore\\u2019s white-collar crime investigators raided the trading floor of stockbroking houses and offices of companies whose stock prices crashed last October, collectively wiping out some S$10 billion in market capitalisation.  Nonetheless, Asiasons managing director and co-founder Datuk Jared Lim tells The Edge that Azlan and Ng had decided to retire at the coming AGM \\u201cmuch earlier in the year\\u201d.  \\u201cDatuk Azlan has in the past few months taken on additional responsibilities in other companies he serves on. It was also decided that the chairman should be chosen from amongst the independent directors in pursuit of better corporate governance,\\u201d Lim says. \\u201cThe decision by Ng was also made earlier this year as the company undertakes a restructuring exercise to streamline existing operations and look into new businesses,\\u201d he says, adding that Ng will continue to serve as \\u201ca committee member in some subsidiary companies for continuity after his resignation [from the Asiasons board]\\u201d.  Lee, meanwhile, informed the board of his decision to retire \\u201cin the previous board meeting\\u201d citing \\u201cincreasing work obligations\\u201d, Lim adds, without specifically mentioning whether media attention on the Singapore penny stock saga had any bearing on his decision.  Last week, the Royal Bank of Canada joined a string of financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Julius Baer Group Ltd, Bank of East Asia Ltd, Malayan Banking Bhd, AmInvestment Banking Group\\u2019s Singapore stockbroking unit AmFraser Securities Pte Ltd and Phillip Securities Pte Ltd, that have filed lawsuits over the October penny stock crash seeking to recover over S$245 million owed by former clients. The US-based Interactive Brokers LLC, the earliest to publicly declare there were shortfalls in its own credit practices and that clients owed it big bucks following the October crash, is also suing its former customers (see diagram).In their joint investigation with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) into suspected trading irregularities in the shares of Asiasons, Blumont Group Ltd and LionGold Corp Ltd, officers from the Singapore Police Force\\u2019s CAD on April 2 confiscated documents and data storage devices and questioned individuals from Blumont and LionGold.  Investigators also approached Magnus Energy Ltd, Innopac Holdings Ltd, Ipco International Ltd and ISR Capital Ltd, which are among a broader group of Singapore-listed lower liners linked to the penny stock trio through a web of crossholdings, reported by The Edge (Issue 989, Nov 18, 2013).   As at April 3, Asiasons appears to be the only one of the three companies named in MAS\\u2019 April 2 statement whose directors and officers had not received notice to assist with investigations. According to Lim last Friday, \\u201cthere has been no other developments since the April 3 announcement\\u201d.  In its statement dated April 10, Asiasons says it will appoint an independent chairman in place of Azlan, who \\u201cvolunteered to retire as [non-executive non-independent chairman] of the company to preserve good governance practice\\u201d.  Of the remaining three Asiason directors, only Yin Kum Choy is up for re-election at the AGM. The other two staying on are Lim and independent director Attlee Hue Kuan Yew, filings show.  Asked if Asiasons will name new directors ahead of its upcoming AGM, Lim says: \\u201cNo, the new directors will not be named just yet.\\u201d Meanwhile, he says it is business as usual at Asiasons. On March 27, the company said its agreement to take a 20% stake in Black Elk Energy Offshore Operations LLC for S$120.5 million had lapsed, but added that it \\u201cmay continue to explore\\u201d whether there are other suitable cooperation opportunities with the same parties.  \\u201cAsiasons continues to explore new business opportunities that are value accretive, including those in the energy sector,\\u201d Lim says. Over at Blumont, lawsuits taken out against executive chairman Neo Kim Hock \\u2014 who is among persons asked to assist the CAD in its investigations \\u2014 were among the reasons chairman-designate and mining executive Alexander Molyneux dropped plans to buy 135 million shares in the company. Had the deal gone through, Molyneux, who is chairman of Celcius Coal Ltd and has experience overseeing exploration companies, would have replaced Neo as Blumont\\u2019s chairman while the latter would have taken on the role of deputy chairman.  At the closing bell last Friday, Blumont shares were at their lowest since August 2012 while Asiasons shares plummeted to their lowest in over five years. Closing at 10.1 Singapore cents last Friday, LionGold, meanwhile, was one cent above its recent low of 9.1 cents on March 6 this year.  Collectively, their market capitalisation stood at S$237.94 million last Friday \\u2014 just 2% of the S$11.23 billion the trio were worth at their respective peaks between Aug 29 and Oct 1 last year \\u2014 down a whopping S$10.99 billion. The smallest of the trio now is Asiasons, whose market cap has shrivelled to S$43.1 million at its 4.4-cent close last Friday, a far cry from the S$979.8 million the company was valued at when its shares fetched S$2.91 apiece on Oct 1, 2013, before the share collapse.

The SP 500 index surged 19.33 points to close at 1,862.31 points while the Dow gained 162.29 points to end at 16,424.85 on Wednesday night. However, China\\u2019s first quarter gross domestic product growth slowed to the most sluggish pace in six quarters, while industrial production and fixed asset investment trailed projections. This dampened the Asia-Pacific market mood after an initial euphoric rise yesterday. The FBM KLCI traded in a very narrow range of 9.25 points for the week with higher volumes of 2.02 billion to 2.59 billion shares done. The index closed at 1,850.54 yesterday, up 5.17 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Genting Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd, Petronas Dagangan Bhd and Public Bank Bhd caused the index to inch up on some institutional buying. The index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (May 2013) and it represented an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cFlat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cPseudo-Bull\\u201d rise completed. The price movements in the index in the few months following May 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69 (high) and 1,802.88 (low). The index\\u2019s daily signals are mixed, with negative Stochastic and MACD signals but positive CCI, DMI and Oscillator readings. As such, the index\\u2019s obvious support levels are seen at 1,802, 1,839 and 1,850, while the resistance areas of 1,854, 1,862 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some very heavy selling. Its simple moving averages depict an emerging uptrend for its weekly and monthly charts. Its daily chart had turned neutral this week though. Due to its mixed chart signals, we believe investors will change to a \\u201crange trading\\u201d mode for the KLCI. Due to the fine tone for the KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Yee Lee Corp Bhd, which announced its fourth quarter ended Dec 31 of financial year 2013 (4QFY13) and full-year results in February 2014. The group saw its full FY13 revenue declining marginally by 5.9% to RM658.3 million from RM699.7 million in FY12. Despite the marginal decline in top line numbers, Yee Lee recorded a significant 45.2% improvement in profit before tax to RM42.7 million in FY13 from RM29.4 million in FY12. The improved profitability can be attributed to the trading division, which performed exceptionally well in FY13, and the palm oil refinery and mill division which managed to report a turnaround. Its subsidiary, Spritzer Bhd, also recorded a substantial increase in profit contribution to the group to RM6.3 million in FY13 from RM4.4 million in FY12. A check of Bloomberg consensus reveals that only two research houses cover the stock with \\u201cbuy\\u201d calls. The stock is currently trading at a fair historical price-earnings ratio of 9.98 times and reasonable price-to-book value of 1.05 times. Yee Lee has a low indicative 12-month dividend yield of 1.32%. Maybank-IB first featured chart coverage on Yee Lee on April 10 at RM1.80. Its chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames are very strong. Its share price made an obvious surge since its daily Wave-2 low of RM1.22 on Dec 18, 2013. Since that RM1.22 low, Yee Lee surged to its recent April 2014 high of RM1.94. Its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to its recent April 2014 high of RM1.94. As it broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of RM1.48 and RM1.73, look to buy Yee Lee on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to long term uptrends for this stock. The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD, Stochastic and Oscillator) are very strong and now depict the firm indications of Yee Lee\\u2019s eventual move towards much higher levels. We expect Yee Lee to remain very well sought after on dips towards its support levels of RM1.48, RM1.73 and RM1.90. It may attract minor profit taking at the resistance levels of RM1.94, RM2.07 and RM2.21. Its upside targets are now located at RM2.12, RM2.24, RM2.55 and RM2.76.

Telekom shares slumped 6% over five days after the March 27 announcement that essentially quashed hopes of more special dividend payments in the near term. In addition, start-up losses from the 57% stake in P1 would eat into earnings as Telekom moves into the space where three dominant mobile-phone operators are already finding it tough to grow, observers say.  Telekom\\u2019s group CEO Tan Sri Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa contests this view. \\u201cTM will never be No 4 in anything,\\u201d says a bemused Zamzamzairani on the notion of his company playing fourth fiddle to Malaysia\\u2019s \\u201cbig three\\u201d mobile operators: Maxis Bhd, DiGi.Com Bhd and its former unit Celcom Axiata Bhd.  \\u201cWe want to be No 1 in terms of providing converged services \\u2014 that\\u2019s very different [from TM playing catch-up with the big three]. People look at us as another mobile player but we are not [adding mobility in isolation]. We\\u2019re a converged player focused on giving the best experience to our customers,\\u201d he tells The Edge.  Telekom\\u2019s decision to add wireless mobility to its traditionally fixed line-centric portfolio may not be that different from a mobile-phone operator like Maxis offering its customers a wireline home phone and broadband to sell more services to existing customers. After all, consumers are increasingly accessing the Internet using mobile phones and tablets, thanks to high-speed Internet on-the-go. \\u201cProviding connectivity alone is not enough\\u2026 Looking at the changing behaviour of customers, if we only remain in that same space, we will get further and further away from the end-user. That\\u2019s why we need to move towards enhancing the user experience with content, devices and apps \\u2014 what we call the innovation exchange,\\u201d Zamzamzairani says, relating Telekom\\u2019s desire to offer an end-to-end suite of services to individuals as well as corporate and enterprise customers.  \\u201cIt\\u2019s about life made easier for our customers, business made easier for our corporate customers. That\\u2019s not just our tagline but how we must approach the market [to win and retain customers]. Technology is no longer a differential because anyone with money can buy technology, which is changing every day.\\u201d  The lack of a differential in quality of service means that users are likely to choose a service provider that gives the best value and customer experience, industry experts say.\\u00a0 This realisation has made it easier for telecoms operators to share network infrastructure \\u2014 something unheard of in the mid-2000s when network coverage strength was still used as a selling point to woo mobile-phone customers.  Similarly, Telekom is recouping its RM8.9 billion investment in its HSBB network faster by selling wholesale capacity to rivals. Old timers would remember the reluctance displayed by Telekom, in its old incarnation, towards \\u201cequal access\\u201d, which would allow rivals to piggyback\\u00a0 on \\u201cthe local loop\\u201d to provide the old-school fixed-line phone service.  While the government made Telekom promise to open the HSBB network to any local licensed provider when RM2.4 billion worth of public funds went into building Phase 1 of the RM11.3 billion HSBB network, some experts think it is Telekom\\u2019s control over this trunk wired fibre network that gives it an edge over the local mobile giants.  \\u201cIt is easier for the fixed-line player to move into mobile, not the other way around,\\u201d says a telecoms analyst, explaining how wireless network is relatively faster and cheaper to roll out.  Zamzamzairani admits as much: \\u201cBecause we are strong in [backhaul fixed line] infrastructure, we have greater control over the end-to-end experience.\\u201d While Telekom is open to more acquisitions to improve its service portfolio, he says the company is more likely to make \\u201copportunistic\\u201d purchases rather than actively seeking out targets.  \\u201cNo 1 doesn\\u2019t mean we have to own everything. We can fill gaps through collaborations like P1 or tie-ups with other players as well,\\u201d he says, adding that enterprise services and business process outsourcing (BPO) are among areas Telekom would like to further strengthen.  For now, the focus is to sort out details of the P1 collaboration, which gives Telekom the right to name the latter\\u2019s CEO. With access to P1\\u2019s 50MHz spectrum in the 2.3GHz and 2.6GHz bands for the 4G-Long Term Evolution (LTE) rollout, TM can make greater use of its spectrum in the lower 450MHz and 850MHz bands that have wider coverage capabilities versus the higher capacity to carry data in the higher bands.  \\u201cWhat TM needs now is permission to use the 850MHz spectrum nationwide, beyond the universal service provision (USP) coverage [in rural areas],\\u201d a telecoms analyst says, drawing comfort from the fact that the Malaysian government has hitherto chosen not to charge high spectrum fees to encourage wider rollout.  Zamzamzairani is convinced that Telekom can make a strong case to ask for continued usage of the 850MHz spectrum for nationwide LTE rollout when the spectrum is up for renewal next year. This would allow Telekom to also offer mobile-phone services, on top of wireless broadband.  The other big-ticket item is the outcome of negotiations on the government\\u2019s co-investment in Phase 2 of the HSBB network rollout announced in Budget 2014 last September. Zamzamzairani says it is premature to give any guidance on capital expenditure as negotiations are still ongoing but is \\u201chopeful\\u201d of concluding talks by year-end.  Instead, he points out the strength of Telekom\\u2019s balance sheet to meet the potential rise in capex needs as well as keep its promise to pay a minimum annual dividend of RM700 million.\\u00a0 \\u201cPeak funding was some RM2.7 billion in 2010, when capital needs for HSBB were at their peak\\u2026 We\\u2019re not a start-up. Today our revenues are much stronger\\u2026\\u00a0 We have said there is no change in our dividend policy and we have many other levers [to pull],\\u201d Zamzamzairani says when pressed for details.  \\u201cYou\\u2019re right that this [change in direction] is a chance to review [the dividend policy] but I can tell you that this is not being considered,\\u201d he adds.  Time will tell if the scenario will change should Telekom\\u2019s stake in P1 rise substantially.\\u00a0According to the terms of the planned RM210 million convertible bonds issuance by Green Packet Bhd, Telekom could end up taking over the latter\\u2019s entire 30% stake in the enlarged P1 if Green Packet defaults on the debt papers. This would raise TM\\u2019s stake from 57% to 87%, leaving South Korea\\u2019s leading LTE operator SK Telekom with a 13% stake. As it is, TM is taking up 60% or RM990 million of P1\\u2019s planned RM1.65 billion convertible bonds to raise cash for network rollout over the next three to five years. For now, Standard & Poor\\u2019s credit analyst Mehul Sukkawala says Telekom\\u2019s credit rating is unaffected by its investment in P1 and the LTE rollout, which is expected to raise debt-to-Ebitda levels to about two times over the next two to three years from 1.7 times in 2013. \\u201cEven then, the ratio is likely to remain significantly below our downgrade rating trigger of close to 2.5 times,\\u201d the analyst writes in an April 3 note. Analysts polled on Bloomberg seem split over TM\\u2019s stock performance for the coming 12 months, with eight \\u201cbuys\\u201d versus 12 \\u201cholds\\u201d and 10 \\u201csells\\u201d and price targets ranging from RM4.80 to RM7.22. Using its current share base, yield was 3.36% at last Thursday\\u2019s RM5.83 close, based on its minimum RM700 million, or 19.57 sen per share, dividend payout. That could limit upside for the stock, although analysts agree that strategic assets are rarely ever cheap. Asked on the naysayers, Zamzamzairani said many doubted the HSBB\\u2019s potential when the idea was mooted in 2008 \\u2014 the reason a minimum dividend was promised to reward investors who stuck on during the lower earnings and high expenditure days. \\u201cToday, HSBB take-up is greater than we thought. Who would have thought that after only three-plus years, take-up rate would be 43%?\\u201d  He, for one, has no doubt that Telekom has \\u201call the important pieces\\u201d of the puzzle to regain the dominance it once enjoyed. Does this mean it is a matter of time before Telekom\\u2019s stock moves back to Malaysia\\u2019s top three position \\u2014 just like in the early 2000 when the so-called TMT (Telekom-Maybank-Tenaga) stocks were the bluest of the Malaysian blue chips?  \\u201cWe\\u2019re not after the top market-cap position per se but it is more of providing customers with the best experience\\u2026 I would say that TM is in the best position to deliver an end-to-end service proposition as we have all the pertinent pieces to play with\\u2026 ARPUs [average revenue per user] are rising, so we must be doing something right.\\u201d This story first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly Edition, on April 7 - April 13, 2014."}, "74": {"date_posted": "11/4/2014", "title": "Ringgit firms but KLCI is muted", "article": " THE Hong Kong and China markets closed higher yesterday, as China announced that it will allow a combined 23.5 billion yuan (RM12.2 billion) of cross-border trading. Asian markets got a further lift when the US Federal Reserve played down predictions by some of its own policymakers that US interest rates may rise faster than they had forecast.  The S&P 500 index surged 20.22 points to close at 1,872.18 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 181.04 points to end at 16,437.18 on Wednesday.  In Malaysia, the FBM KLCI traded in a narrow range of 11.53 points for the week with high volumes of 1.90 billion to 2.22 billion shares done. The index closed at 1,859.52 yesterday, up 3.77 points from the previous day as blue chips such as British American Tobacco (M) Bhd, Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd, Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd, Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd and IOI Properties Group Bhd caused the index to inch up on some late local buying activity yesterday.  The ringgit firmed against the US dollar on foreign selling of the greenback and gained from 3.2790 to 3.2230 over the last few days. The FBM KLCI rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (May 2013) and it represented an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cFlat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cPseudo-Bull\\u201d rise completed. The price movements in the index in the next few months following May 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69 (high) and 1,802.88 (low). The index\\u2019s daily signals (such as CCI, DMI, MACD and Oscillator) are positive. As such, the index\\u2019s firm support levels are seen at the 1,802, 1,839 and 1,859 levels, while the resistance levels of 1,862, 1,869 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some very heavy selling activity. The index could soon rise towards its short to medium-term upside targets of 1,871 and 1,882 eventually. Its simple moving averages (MA) depict an emerging uptrend for its daily, weekly and monthly charts. Due to its firmer chart signals, we believe investors will persist with a \\u201cbuy on dips\\u201d for the KLCI.  Due to the firmer tone for the KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Choo Bee Metal Bhd. The group\\u2019s financial year 2013 ended Dec 31 (FY13) revenue improved marginally to RM469.1 million from RM449.7 million in FY12. The improvement was attributed to the trading segment which partially offset the slightly weaker manufacturing segment.  The group\\u2019s FY13 profit before tax of RM23.3 million had increased significantly by 86.4% from FY12\\u2019s RM12.5 million. The company said in its results announcement that the strong profitability was mainly due to lower raw material costs from the manufacturing segment and higher sales volume.  A check of Bloomberg consensus reveals that only two research houses cover the stock with \\u201cbuy\\u201d calls. The stock is currently trading at a low historical price-earnings ratio of 11.8 times and is trading below its book value at a price-to-book value of 0.62 times. Choo Bee has a decent indicative 12-month dividend yield of 2.05%. Maybank IB initiated chart coverage on Choo Bee on April 9 at RM2.16. Its chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames are very strong. Its share price made an obvious surge since its weekly Wave-2 low of RM1.50 in February.  Since that RM1.50 low, Choo Bee has surged to this month\\u2019s high of RM2.50. Its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends. As it broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of RM1.67 and RM1.85, look to buy Choo Bee on any dips to its support levels as the MA depict very firm short to long-term uptrends for this stock. The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD, Stochastic and Oscillator) are very strong and now depict the firm indications of Choo Bee\\u2019s eventual move towards much higher levels.  We expect the company to remain very well sought after on dips towards its support levels of RM1.67, RM1.85 and RM2.45. It may attract minor profit-taking at the resistance levels of RM2.50, RM2.60 and RM2.86. Its upside targets are now located at RM2.95, RM3.14, RM3.25 and RM3.40.Lee Cheng Hooi is the regional chartist at Maybank Kim Eng.

Notwithstanding the projection of slower growth in the industry, the country\\u2019s largest bank is targeting a 12% loan growth in the domestic market. \\u201cOverall, we target to grow faster than the industry growth rate to gain market share,\\u201d Abdul Farid told reporters after the bank\\u2019s 54th annual general meeting (AGM) yesterday. Maybank is targeting a group loan growth of 13% in 2014, underpinned by a growth of up to 20% in Indonesia, 12% growth in Malaysia, and 13% growth in Singapore. \\u201cWhen we grew 14% [across loans and deposits growth] last year, we also grew about 12% domestically as well,\\u201d said Farid, adding that there was a time when the local market was growing at about 11%. Maybank\\u2019s loan growth last year was driven by its Indonesia operations, which grew 27.9% year-on-year, followed by Singapore (13.6%) and Malaysia (11.9%). In terms of international operations, the banking group has achieved a loan growth of 17.6%. \\u201cThe first quarter of this year will not show that kind of trend [like last year\\u2019s]\\u2026 But we are optimistic that for the rest of the year we should be able to achieve the target,\\u201d said Abdul Farid. In a presentation, he pointed out that the competitive landscape in the banking industry is putting pressure on loan pricing and funding costs. He also expected changing the macroeconomic environment to result in higher inflation and rising interest rates. Additionally, he noted that new regulatory requirements would change the operating landscape for banks and the volatility in financial markets would pose as one of the challenges in the sector. On prospects, Maybank group is seeking improvements in terms of profitability. One way to do this, Abdul Farid said, is by being more disciplined with cost management. \\u201cWe have a strategic cost management programme whereby we look at every cost item diligently. We also have a team that [analyses] whether a cost spent is crucial to the bank or a waste,\\u201d he noted. Chairman Tan Sri Megat Zaharuddin Megat Mohd Nor said Maybank\\u2019s diversified footprint across the region also gives it a different perspective on cost management. \\u201cLeveraging the synergies in the different businesses within the group in a more effective way hopefully improves top areas such as cash management, transaction banking and cross-border IPOs,\\u201d he said. Through organic and inorganic growth, Abdul Farid said Maybank is on track to meet its target to have 40% profit contribution from its overseas operations by next year.  \\u201cBased on our portfolio at the moment, for us to grow organically we should be able to bring that [overseas contribution] up to 35% by year 2015,\\u201d he said, but adding that the remainder has to come from inorganic activities. Maybank \\u2014 which has branches in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong \\u2014 has not been able to penetrate into Thailand, although it is also seeking growth opportunities in Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines, among others. \\u201cWe have a few options looking at inorganic growth. Thailand is a market that we have not been able to penetrate in a commercial banking perspective.\\u201d  POSITIVE OUTLOOK...

On corporate exercises, he said Maybank is not in discussions with any party on a potential reverse takeover (RTO) to list 10% of its shares in Maybank Philippines Inc (MPI) on the Philippines Stock Exchange by end-2015. \\u201cThere is a requirement given by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) for us to list the bank by 2015. It\\u2019s not true that we are talking to anybody on potential RTOs or potential acquisitions and mergers [at this juncture],\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut that is an option,\\u201d he added. \\u201cThe options for us remain that either we do it by way of RTO or we do it by way of merger or straight listing,\\u201d he said, adding that Maybank wants to have as many options to see what make sense before it proceeds with one.

Speaking to reporters after launching his book titled 21st Century Economics In The Muslim World, Musa said the industry would be hampered if it was reserved only for Malay Muslims. \\u201cThat is one of the biggest problems we have when we talk about religion,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou must become Muslim first only then you can handle it. Then Islamic financing and banking will just go down the drain. \\u201cAs it is, now it is open. You should not and cannot insist only Malays handle it,\\u201d he added. He was commenting on a question from the press that non-Muslims seem to be more interested in Islamic finance and banking compared to Malay Muslims. Musa said this perception was not true, as many banks that are purveyors of Islamic finance are headed by successful Malay Muslims. \\u201cFor example, the head of Malayan Banking (Maybank) is a very successful Malay who has won awards. Many banks have successful Malays working there not because it is Islamic finance but because they understand Syariah compliance,\\u201d he added. However, Musa said as the industry is relatively new, there are many areas that need to be strengthened and standardised. Islamic finance is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the international market. Saudi Arabia's first English-language newspaper Arab News reported yesterday that Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, the world\\u2019s two largest Islamic financial services markets, has formed ties to help boost growth in both the countries. A report released by the Oxford Business Group (OBG), a global publishing and consultancy company producing annual investment and economic reports on more than 30 countries, said that the deal, signed recently, will see the exchanges in Kuala Lumpur and Riyadh share expertise and develop human resources jointly. It covers topics such as equities, mutual funds and sukuk (Islamic bonds) and comes after an agreement between Malaysia\\u2019s central bank and the UAE in October on bolstering economic ties, including in the arena of Islamic finance services. According to official statistics, the Saudi Arabia and Malaysia jointly hold US$682 billion (RM2.3 trillion) in Islamic banking assets. Tadawul, the Saudi stock exchange, lists the world\\u2019s biggest Islamic banks, while Bursa Malaysia hosts the largest and most liquid market for sukuk. The Malaysian market is set to expand this year due to greater international interest. Even London has jumped at the opportunity to be a hub for Islamic financing. Prime Minister David Cameron had pledged in October last year to make London one of the world's \"great capitals of Islamic finance\" when he unveils Treasury plans to create a \\u00a3200 million (RM1.8 billion) Islamic bond by early next year. He had also said he will unveil plans by the London Stock Exchange to launch the first Islamic Market Index.

This was reflected in the initial panic selling of MAS\\u2019 shares last Monday, which saw the stock tumble 17% in intra-day trading before recovering at the end of the day.  Interestingly, the counter remained steady for the rest of the week, hovering at around 24 sen. However, its trading volume was unusually high last week, averaging 124 million shares daily, suggesting that there were a considerable number of sellers and buyers.  Market watchers say institutions, including Khazanah Nasional Bhd, which is MAS\\u2019 largest shareholder with a 69.37% stake, may have somewhat muted any heavy impact on the stock.  However, there were also investors who took the opportunity to accumulate MAS shares, betting on the airline\\u2019s recovery from the catastrophe. Such optimism is not unfounded. In the past, airlines affected by accidents had recovered in terms of both share price and revenue. Singapore Airlines, for example, saw its shares drop more than 9% after an incident in October 2000, but it recovered shortly after.  Still, negative consumer sentiment may affect MAS\\u2019 load factor, at least in the near term. While the airline is already operating at historically high load factors \\u2014 beating even those of Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific \\u2014 the main concern is a further erosion of its passenger yields. The lower yield is the result of the airline discounting its fares to fill up its seats. Anticipating lower yields following the MH370 incident, Hong Leong Research, for one, has projected wider losses for the airline in FY2014 ending Dec 31 \\u2014 by at least RM50 million from its original forecast. It sees MAS posting a net loss of RM942 million in FY2014 compared with an earlier forecast of RM892 million. MAS reported a RM1.17 billion loss in FY2013. Analysts say besides lowering fares, MAS will need to work extra hard to regain flyers\\u2019 confidence in the airline. These efforts could include splurging on marketing campaigns. \\u201cHence, we expect tougher challenges ahead for MAS to turn around,\\u201d says Hong Leong Research in a note.  Given that flight MH370 was carrying mostly Chinese passengers, the question arises as to whether MAS will lose a significant share of the China market. No, say analysts, including Mohshin Aziz of Maybank Investment Bank. \\u201cThe market is huge in that sector and I believe with competitive fares, MAS will not lose the [China] market,\\u201d comments Mohshin. Although MAS did not detail the contribution from the China market in its latest annual report, it has in the past singled out the country as one of its core growth markets. Meanwhile, MAS may need to compensate the next of kin of flight MH370 passengers.\\u00a0 It is too early to estimate how much compensation MAS may need to pay but judging from historical accounts, the financial impact on the airline is not expected to be significant relative to its revenue. MAS will need to work hard to regain flyers\\u2019 confidence in the airline For instance, in the case of Air France flight 447, which crashed in 2009, killing 228, an advance compensation of \\u20ac17,600 was paid for each passenger, bringing the total to \\u20ac4 million. The airline also granted \\u20ac100,000 (for a total of \\u20ac22.8 million) in compensation through insurance as a compassionate gesture. The Air France flight crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Brazil, in 2009 but its main wreckage and black box were only found two years later.  In MAS\\u2019 case, it has reportedly provided a total of RMB31,000 (RM16,577) in initial financial assistance to each of the affected families. While it is expected to pay out more, the impact of such one-off compensation is expected to be minimal, given that most of it would be covered by insurance. The current crisis is unprecedented for MAS, which registered negative net operating cash flow of RM854.79 million in FY2013 compared with RM305.04 million in FY2012. Further deterioration in its operating condition could eat into its RM3.75 billion cash pile as at Dec 31, 2013, fast. The cash was mostly from a rights issue that raised RM3 billion in the middle of 2013. MAS, which is undergoing a fleet replacement programme, needs about RM1 billion a year to stay afloat.  The tangible impact aside, the missing flight MH370 has left an indelible mark on MAS\\u2019 stellar record in the industry. Given the severity of the incident, Hong Leong Research does not discount the possibility of changes in MAS\\u2019 top management. \\u201cThis is the second incident under the current management after the crash of MAS Wing in Kudat, Sabah, in October 2013 that saw three deaths,\\u201d it says in a note. Maybank IB\\u2019s Mohshin says the current crisis could be a reason to revisit plans to privatise the national carrier. \\u201cIf there is any inclination to privatise MAS, this incident is all the more reason to do so and fix the airline,\\u201d he says.

Loss at China unit and foreign exchange (forex) losses had also curbed profit. Top Glove said net profit declined to RM41.5 million in the quarter ended February 28 this year (2QFY14) from RM50.3 million. Revenue fell to RM548.3 million from RM576.4 million.

The index price movement in the next few months following May 2013 was trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low) and 1,838.69 (high). The index\\u2019s daily signals (like CCI, DMI, MACD and Stochastic) are mainly negative except the Oscillator. As such, the index\\u2019s weaker support levels are seen at 1,769, 1,799 and 1,813, while the resistance areas of 1,818, 1,839 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some very heavy selling activities. Our rebound retracement target of 1,839.26 (62% level) capped the index on March 6. As the index could not penetrate above this key level, it has thrown the KLCI\\u2019s onus to the downside, with critical supports of 1,813 and 1,800 in focus again. Its simple moving averages (MA) depict a neutral trend for its daily and weekly charts. Due to its weaker chart signals, we believe investors will adopt a \\u201ctake profit on rallies\\u201d philosophy for the KLCI. Due to the softer tone for the KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201csell\\u201d on Malaysia Airport Holdings Bhd (MAHB), which announced that it has not received the certificate of completion and compliance (CCC) for klia2, which was due on Jan 31. A delay in the May 2 opening of klia2 looks imminent, given that the operational readiness and airport transfer (ORAT) normally takes three to six months to complete post the issuance of the CCC. klia2 is set to be MAHB\\u2019s biggest earnings driver for the year and much optimism on the stock is premised on the project being on track. It is now uncertain when klia2 will be ready for operations and our analyst doubts that the RM4 billion capital expenditure budget is on target. Our Maybank IB analyst has downgraded MAHB to \\u201csell\\u201d with a target price of RM7.03 based on a 2014 price-earnings ratio (PER) of 20.5 times bringing near-term valuations more in line with its peers. A check on Bloomberg consensus reveals 18 brokers covering the stock. Of the 18 research houses that cover the stock, five have a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call, seven \\u201csell\\u201d and six \\u201chold\\u201d.\\u00a0\\u00a0 The stock is currently trading at a high historical PER of 25.1 times and a high price-to-book value of 2.11 times. MAHB\\u2019s price trends on the daily chart are weaker. Its share price made an obvious decline since its daily Wave-5 and all-time high of RM9.78 in December 2013. Since that RM9.78 high, MAHB declined to its recent February 2014 low of RM7.87. Its chart has moved into an obvious daily downtrend to its recent February 2014 low of RM7.87. As it broke below its recent key critical support levels of RM9.43 and RM8.62, look to \\u201csell\\u201d MAHB on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to medium term downtrends for this stock. The daily indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD, Oscillator and Stochastic) are very negative and now depict the obvious indications of MAHB\\u2019s eventual move towards much lower levels. We expect MAHB to remain weaker towards its support levels of RM6.90, RM7.87 and RM7.90. It will attract heavy liquidation at the resistance levels of RM8.08, RM8.62 and RM9.78. Its downside retracement targets are now located at RM7.76, RM6.74 and RM6.51. Lee Cheng Hooi is the regional chartist at Maybank Kim Eng.

The stock is expected to continue to trade at low levels, although analysts said any weakness is expected to be short-lived and its share price may soon rebound. MAS shares opened lower at 21 sen yesterday, after closing at 25 sen last Friday. This occurrence is called a \\u201cgap down\\u201d, which happens because buy or sell orders are placed before the opening that cause the price to open lower than the previous day\\u2019s close. Shares fell to an intra-day low of 20.5 sen, but later recovered to hit an intra-day high of 24.5 sen before ending the day down 4% or 1 sen at 24 sen. MAS was the most active counter on Bursa Malaysia, with 385.06 million shares traded or a 2.3% portion on a share base of 16.7 billion. Analysts expect near-term weakness in MAS shares following the disappearance of the flight, based on historical mishaps of other airlines and the impact on their share prices. \\u201cLooking at historical air mishaps and the impact on the share prices of Asiana, Air France and Singapore Airlines, we observe that share prices declined by 7% to 20% after the first month of the incident,\\u201d said Maybank IB Research analyst Mohshin Aziz. Mohshin, however, expects the stock to recover and recoup its losses within three months. He also sees the incident impacting the national carrier\\u2019s financials and its ability to push for higher yields over the immediate term as near-term customer perception will likely be affected. Mohshin also said his \\u201chold\\u201d call on MAS at 25 sen and its target price of 26 sen are under review. Still, with insufficient information of the missing aircraft at this juncture, analysts are of the view that it is too premature to make out the current situation. \\u201cPast aircraft disasters suggest a negative impact on share prices immediately after the incident. While it is too early, with little firm information to reach a conclusion at this stage, we think that the share price is likely to see some knee-jerk reaction from this news \\u2014 as the most possible outcome [on MAS] looks negative at this stage,\\u201d said AmResearch Sdn Bhd in a note to clients yesterday.  On capacity, AmResearch views that MAS\\u2019 capacity plan may not be impacted significantly, as the outgoing 777 is to be replaced with a new Airbus 330-300. The research firm added that MAS expects a net reduction of one aircraft this year, but available seat kilometres is expected to grow by 10% via improving aircraft utilisation from an average 10 hours per day in 2013 to 11 hours 10 minutes in 2014. AmResearch has a \\u201csell\\u201d call on MAS, with a fair value of 27 sen. Hong Leong Investment Bank research analyst Daniel Wong said in a note yesterday that he expects further selldown pressure on MAS in the immediate term. Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd fell 14 sen to close at RM8.24 yesterday. AirAsia Bhd remained unchanged at RM2.52, while AirAsia X rose 1 sen to 81.5 sen.

Apart from incurring high expenditure on current crisis management which could be long-drawn if the aircraft and the 239 crew members and passengers could not be located, MAS might have to face a long string of legal suits from family members of passengers. The MH370 since Saturday has caused some analysts to either lower the earnings forecast of the national airline or put the stock under review. Kian Joo Can Factory Bhd, which along with associated companies Can-One Bhd and Box-Pak (M) Bhd have suspended their share trading since 2.30pm today, announced it has received a non-binding letter of interest from Toyota Tsusho Corporation (TTC) to purchase 51% of the issued and outstanding stocks of Kian Joo Can Factory. \\u201cKian Joo has on 10 March 2014 received the letter which does not tantamount to an offer as the letter stated it is non-binding and is merely an expression of TTC's preliminary intention,\\u201d said Kian Joo in a filing to Bursa Malaysia. Kian Joo is seeking further details from TTC. Prior to the suspension, Kian Joo shares rose three sen or 0.94% to RM3.21 while Can-One added two sen or 0.62% to RM3.22. Box-Pak traded flat at RM2.22. Golsta Synergy Bhd was slapped with an unusual market activity (UMA) query by Bursa Malaysia Securities Bhd over the sharp rise in the price in its shares recently. The regulator today directed the company to make enquiries with its directors and major shareholders for the cause of the movements in the company\\u2019s shares and make public these findings. Golsta jumped 56 sen or 16.6% to end at RM3.94 with 636,200 shares done. In the past one month, its share price had shot up by nearly 100% from RM2.00 per unit. In reply to the UMA, Golsta said there were no new developments with regards to the company. But it added, it had earlier made an announcement that the company had received a notice of conditional mandatory take-over offer from GS Capital Sdn Bhd (or Tan Sri Clement Hii) to acquire all of the remaining ordinary shares of Golsta not already held by the offeror and persons acting in concert, at the offer price of RM2.10 per unit. Berjaya Auto Bhd\\u2019s net profit rose 376% on-year to RM30.6 million in the third quarter ended Jan 31, 2014, from RM6.4 million. Revenue also leapt 53% on-year to RM343.0 million from RM224.6 million. In a statement to Bursa Malaysia, the firm said the higher profit mainly arose from the weakened yen against the ringgit. It added higher revenue and improvement in profit margin also helped. For the nine-month period, net profit recorded RM84.3 million versus RM27.5 million in the previous corresponding period, while revenue registered RM1.05 billion from RM656.1 million a year earlier. \\u201cOutlook for the short and medium terms will be challenging as the Malaysian automotive industry is getting crowded with distributors of Korean and European cars,\\u201d said Berjaya Auto going forward. Plantation stocks may be in focus again after palm oil advanced to the highest level in almost 18 months today, following the release of official data. Palm oil production in Malaysia dropped to the lowest since April 2012, depleting stockpiles in the world\\u2019s second biggest supplier to an eight-month low, according to Bloomberg. The contract for May delivery gained as much as 0.7 per cent to RM2,907 ($885) a metric ton on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives, the highest level since September 2012, and was at RM2,893 at 4:46 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur. Price rose 3.1 per cent last week after bullish projections on prices by international experts. Inventories fell 14 per cent to 1.66 million tons from a month earlier, the lowest level since June, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board said today. This was the biggest drop since February 2009. Malayan Banking Bhd's (Maybank) proposed establishment of its Singapore-based insurance unit Etiqa Pte Ltd has received conditional approval from regulators there. In a statement to the Bursa Malaysia today, Maybank said the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) had approved the establishment of Etiqa which planned to offer life and general insurance in Singapore.

The index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (May 2013) and it represented an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cFlat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cPseudo-Bull\\u201d rise completed. The index price movements in the next few months following May 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high) and 1,769.80 (low). The index\\u2019s daily signals (CCI, DMI, MACD, Stochastic and Oscillator) are all positive. As such, its obvious support levels are seen at 1,769, 1,813 and 1,838, while the resistance areas of 1,839, 1,868 and all-time high of 1,882 may witness some heavy profit-taking activities. Our rebound retracement target of 1,839.26 (62% level) has capped the index in the short term. As the index would penetrate above this key level very soon with high volumes, investors can be more certain of an eventual test of the 1,882.2 high once again. Its simple moving averages (MA) depict a triple timeframe for its daily, weekly and monthly charts. Due to its firmer chart signals, we believe investors may adopt a \\u201cNibble on Dips\\u201d philosophy for the KLCI . Due to the optimistic tone of the KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Ornapaper Bhd (Orna), which broke out of its rangebound zone to record a new 52-week high at the beginning of February 2014. It then consolidated as investors awaited the company\\u2019s results for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31 of financial year 2013 (4QFY13). It announced its results on Feb 27 and its good performance caused the stock to continue on its upward trajectory. For 4QFY13, Orna\\u2019s group sales rose 14.9% on strong demand for its products. Profit before tax went up 308% year-on-year for the quarter. A check on Bloomberg shows that no research house has coverage on this stock. The stock is currently trading at a low historical price-earnings ratio of 11.2 times and a cheap price-to-book value of 0.81 times. Orna\\u2019s chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly timeframes are very strong. Its share price made an obvious surge since its weekly Wave-2 low of 41 sen in May 2012. Since that 41 sen low, Orna surged to its recent February 2014 high of RM1.42. On its monthly chart, Orna has formed a major rounding bottom formation since its listing in 2003. Its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to its recent February 2014 high of RM1.42.As it broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of 77 sen and 88 sen, look to \\u201cbuy\\u201d Orna on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to medium term uptrends for this stock. The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI and Oscillator) are very positive and now depict the obvious indications of Orna\\u2019s eventual move towards much higher levels. We expect Orna to remain very well sought after on dips towards its support levels of 77 sen, 88 sen and RM1.24. It may attract minor profit-taking activities at the resistance levels of RM1.42, RM1.46 and RM1.69. Its upside targets are now located at RM1.47, RM1.74, RM2.30 and RM2.65.

After what looked like a pause in new store openings in FY2013, the group is looking to open six new Brands Outlets and three Padini Concept Stores (PCS) by the end of FY2014.  Padini director Chan Kwai Heng tells The Edge that the group has already opened three new Brands Outlet stores \\u2014 in Penang, Langkawi and Miri.  \\u201cWe are expecting to open three more [Brands Outlet stores] \\u2014 one each in Seremban, USJ and Johor Baru. They are expected to come in by the end of June.\\u201d\\u00a0  Meanwhile, the group has opened one PCS in Gurney Paragon, Penang, and is expected to open two more \\u2014 in Seremban and Miri \\u2014 in two months\\u2019 time, according to Chan.  The planned store openings appear to be the most aggressive in recent years. In FY2013, the group opened only one new Brands Outlet store while in FY2012, there were four PCS openings. Padini, which makes apparel under brands such as Padini Authentics, Vincci, Seed, Brands Outlet, Miki Kids, Miki Mom and P&Co, also operates two caf\\u00e9s called Seed Caf\\u00e9. Founded in 1971, Padini\\u2019s products are available in Malaysia, Bahrain, Brunei, Cambodia, Egypt, Indonesia, Kuwait, Morocco, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, the Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates. Major shareholders in Padini include its managing director Yong Pang Chaun\\u2019s private entity, Yong Pang Chaun Holdings Sdn Bhd, with a 43.74% stake, and Skim Amanah Saham Bumiputera with 5.01%.  Despite the company maintaining a strong balance sheet and consistently paying out dividends, investors have pared their holdings in Padini due to the expected slowdown in consumer spending on the back of the government\\u2019s subsidy rationalisation exercise. Retail stocks are usually among the first to be affected by higher cost of food, petrol and utilities as well as toll rates as consumers adopt more prudent spending habits and reduce discretionary spending.  Padini has declined 23.6% from its one-year peak of RM2.08 last May to a two-year historical low of RM1.59 on Feb 6.  Some are seeing a buying opportunity.  Maybank Investment Bank Research\\u2019s Kang Chun Ee has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on Padini and a target price of RM1.87, noting that there is still upside potential to the stock. \\u201cPadini is the highest yielding stock in our consumer sector coverage.\\u201d With net cash of RM178.1 million, he expects special dividends to be distributed in the future, given its net cash per share of 27 sen as at end-September 2013. For FY2013, the group paid out a dividend of eight sen per share, compared with six sen in FY2012. Kang expects this to increase to 11.5 sen per share for FY2014, which translates into a yield of 7.1%. \\u00a0 For its 1QFY2014 ended Sept 30, 2013, Padini paid an interim dividend of 2.5 sen per share and a special dividend of 1.5 sen, which prompted Kang to revise upwards his forecast to 11.5 sen.  In 1QFY2014, the group\\u2019s net profit increased to RM27.7 million from RM25.3 million a year ago. Revenue also rose to RM217.2 million from RM201.1 million previously.  The group says the improvement was driven primarily by an increase in exports and the strong performance of its Brands Outlet stores.  Padini is expected to grow its net profit to RM95.8 million in FY2014 from RM85.4 million in FY2013, says Kang. Revenue is expected to increase to RM837.2 million from RM789.8 million previously.  Padini\\u2019s revenue is also projected to reach the RM1 billion mark in FY2016, with net profit of about RM118.7 million, according to Kang\\u2019s estimates. AmResearch\\u2019s Tan Ee Zhio says the operating environment remains challenging due to intense competition. She has a \\u201chold\\u201d call and a target price of RM1.80 for Padini.  \\u201cWe maintain our earnings numbers and neutral stance on the stock in light of uncertainties about consumer spending and a potential slowdown in the group\\u2019s sales volume,\\u201d she says.  Nevertheless, she expects Padini to post strong second quarter results buoyed by consumer spending during the year-end festive seasons.  She adds that bundling promotions, especially by Brands Outlet, will further drive earnings growth forward.  \\u201cWe are maintaining our gross profit margin assumption at 46% for FY2014, compared with FY2013\\u2019s 47%, in view of margin pressure arising from a notable shift in consumer preference for value-for-money products.\\u201d  With a market capitalisation of RM1.1 billion, Padini was among the 10 Malaysian companies listed in Forbes Asia magazine\\u2019s \\u201cAsia\\u2019s 200 Best Under A Billion\\u201d companies in 2013.

The SP500 index inched up a mere 0.04 points to close at 1,845.16 points while the Dow gained 18.75 points to end at 16,198.41.

The index closed at 1,831.66 yesterday, up 9.11 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks such as CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, IOI Corp Bhd, Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd and PPB Group Bhd caused the index to rise. The index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (May 2013) and it represented an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cFlat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cPseudo-Bull\\u201d rise completed. The index price movements in the next few months following May 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high) and 1,769.80 (low). The index\\u2019s daily signals (CCI, DMI, MACD and Oscillator) are mainly positive except its Stochastic. As such, the index\\u2019s obvious support levels are seen at the 1,769, 1,799 and 1,831 levels, while the resistance areas of 1,833, 1,839 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some very heavy profit taking.  Our rebound retracement target of 1,839.26 (62% level) may cap the index in the short to medium term. The index must penetrate this key level with high volumes to be certain of an eventual test of the 1,882.20 high again. Its simple moving averages (MA) depict a triple timeframe for its daily, weekly and monthly chart. Due to its firmer chart signals, we believe investors may adopt a \\u201cNibble on Dips\\u201d philosophy for the KLCI.  Due to the uncertain tone of the KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201csell\\u201d on Pos Malaysia Bhd. It fell on strong selling on Feb 20 backed by high volumes suggesting an overly pessimistic view of its results for the third quarter ended Dec 31, 2013 of financial year 2014 (3QFY14). Its 3Q pre-tax profit was 19.3% lower at RM33.8 million.  Looking at the current reported shareholding changes on Bloomberg, we observe that the Employees Provident Fund and Aberdeen Asset (which hold 11.05% and 9.31% respectively) reduced their stakes this month and this could have led to the huge price decline. A check on Bloomberg consensus indicates that five research house have coverage on the stock. Only one of them has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the stock, while the remaining four have a \\u201chold\\u201d call. The stock is currently trading at a historical price-earnings ratio of 18 times and a high price-to-book value of 2.6 times. Pos Malaysia\\u2019s chart trends on the daily and weekly timeframes are very weak. Its share price made an obvious decline since its weekly Wave-5 high of RM6.05 last November. Since that RM6.05 high, Pos Malaysia fell to its recent February low of RM4.32. Its chart has moved into very strong daily and weekly downtrends to its recent February low of RM4.32. As it broke above its recent key critical support levels of RM5.31 and RM5.23, look to sell Pos Malaysia on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to medium term downtrends for this stock.  The daily and weekly indicators (such as the CCI, DMI, Oscillator and MACD) are very negative and now depict the obvious indications of Pos Malaysia\\u2019s eventual decline towards much lower levels.  We expect Pos Malaysia to remain very weak towards its support levels of RM3.94, RM4.32 and RM4.49. It will attract major selling and liquidation activities at the resistance levels of RM4.71, RM5.23 and RM6.05. Its downside targets are now at RM3.57, RM2.24 and RM1.05.Lee Cheng Hooi is the regional chartist at Maybank Kim Eng.

The FY13 record profit was 14% higher than FY12\\u2019s RM5.75 billion. Revenue for the full year rose significantly to RM33.25 billion from RM31.23 billion in FY12.

In the fourth quarter, group revenue was RM4.40 billion compared with RM4.24 billion in the previous year\\u2019s corresponding quarter (4Q12), an increase of 4%. For the full year of 2013, total profits also fell to RM1.81 billion, from RM3.98 billion in 2012. Revenue, however, rose to RM17.11 billion, from RM16.46 billion. Genting said the lower final quarter profit was mainly attributable to lower EBITDA and lower gain on disposal of available-for-sale financial assets. It noted that profit of RM1,941 million in 4Q12 related to the disposal of the Kuala Langat power plant was completed on 22 October 2012. Genting Malaysia Berhad said it posted a net profit of RM400.5 million for the fourth quarter to end-December 2013 (4Q13), down from RM445.7 million in similar quarter a year ago. Revenue achieved was RM2,120 million in 4Q13, compared to RM1,926 million in the preceding year (4Q12). Net profit for the full year was higher at RM1.60 billion, up from RM1.40 billion. Revenue increased to RM8.33 billion, from RM7.89 billion. \\u00a0 Telekom Malaysia Bhd\\u2019s net profit fell 5% to RM344.2 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2013, from RM363.2 million in similar quarter of 2012. But revenue rose 6% y-o-y to RM2.98 billion from RM2.81 billion. The telecommunications giant said it had declared a final dividend of 16.3 sen per share. For the full-year period, net profit stood at RM1.01 billion versus RM1.26 billion in the previous year, while revenue recorded was RM10.63 billion versus RM9.99 billion a year ago. Telekom said for the year under review, net profit decreased primarily due to foreign exchange loss of RM105.2 million in the current financial year compared with a gain of RM73.4 million last year. The group said another contributing factor was the lower deferred tax income on unutilised tax incentives. DRB-Hicom Bhd\\u2019s net profit plunged 64% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM141.6 million in the third quarter ended Dec 31, 2013, from RM391.5 million. But revenue jumped 20% y-o-y to RM3.33 billion from RM2.78 billion. In a filing to the stock exchange, the group said it declared a single-tier dividend of 1.50 sen per share. For the nine-month period, net profit was RM289.9 million versus RM504.7 million in the previous period, while revenue generated was RM10.03 billion from RM9.77 billion a year ago. Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) reported an 18.6% rise in fourth quarter net profit from a year earlier on higher Islamic banking and non-interest income. Lower allowance for bad loans also supported profit growth. Maybank said net profit rose to RM1.73 billion in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2013 (4QFY13) from RM1.46 billion. Revenue climbed to RM8.27 billion from RM7.8 billion. Maybank's full-year net profit increased to RM6.55 billion from RM5.75 billion a year earlier. Revenue was higher at RM33.25 billion versus RM31.23 billion. Maybank plans to pay a dividend of 31 sen a share for 4QFY13. IHH Healthcare Bhd\\u2019s net profit soared 47% to RM230.1 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2013, from RM156.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Revenue also rose 16.5% y-o-y to RM1.78 billion from RM1.53 billion. The healthcare service provider said it recommended a first and final single-tier cash dividend of 2 sen for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2013. IHH said the strong net profit growth was due to three factors: double-digit EBITDA growth, recapitalisation of Turkish healthcare institution, Acibadem Healthcare Group in Q4 2012, and recognition of investment tax allowances of RM22.9 million in Q4 2013. For the full-year period, net profit dropped to RM631.2 million versus RM750.8 million in the previous year, while revenue raked-in dipped to RM6.76 billion from RM6.96 billion a year ago. MKH Bhd\\u2019s net profit for the first financial quarter ended 31/12/2013 fell over 50% to RM16.8 million, from RM 34.2 million in similar quarter the previous year. Revenue for the quarter rose to RM182.5 million from RM147.8 million a year ago. The group had attributed its lower profits to unrealised foreign exchange losses caused by the weakening of local and foreign currencies. On prospects, the property group says it expects to achieve satisfactory results for the financial year ending 30 September 2014 with contributions from its property, construction and plantation divisions.  Boustead Holdings Berhad delivered strong results for the financial year ended 31 December 2013, with a higher profit after tax (PAT) of RM560 million, up 12% compared with RM499 million in the previous financial year. This was achieved on the back of a turnover of RM11.2 billion compared with the previous year\\u2019s RM9.8 billion. For its fourth quarter ended 31 December 2013, the group registered a PAT of RM228 million. This represents a 50% increase from RM152 million in the previous year\\u2019s corresponding quarter. PBT for the quarter under review jumped substantially by 78% to RM281 million while revenue improved to RM3.6 billion. The company announced a dividend of 7.5 sen per share for the financial year. Sunway Bhd\\u00a0 posted a net profit of RM1.14 billion for the fourth quarter results to December 2013, up by 677% compared to RM146.56 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Sunway declared an interim dividend of 5 sen per share, bringing total dividends for FY2013 to 10 sen. For the full year of 2013, the company reported net profit of RM1.50 billion from RM438.83 million in the previous financial year. Annual revenue was RM4.73 billion compared to RM4.13 billion recorded in 2012. MMC Corporation Bhd posted much lower profits for its fourth quarter and full year of 2013 due mainly to the deconsolidation of Gas Malaysia post listing, and lower contribution from Malakoff. It reported a net profit of RM40.96 million for its fourth financial quarter to December 2013, which was 49% lower than RM80.04 million posted in the fourth quarter of 2012. Similarly, revenue for the quarter also fell to RM1.85 billion from RM2.06 billion. For the full year of 2013, total profits plunged 75% to RM228.66 million from RM922.35 million a year ago.

For the full FY13, the group posted a net loss of RM1.17 billion, up 170% from the previous year\\u2019s net loss of RM432.6 million. For MAS\\u2019 largest shareholder, Khazanah Nasional Bhd, which has a 69.37% stake in the airline, the share price fall translates to a paper loss of RM581.7 billion. The second largest shareholder is the Employees\\u2019 Provident Fund with a 1.04% stake.

MAS\\u2019 losses had increased despite the fact that it managed to fly more flights and passengers, while filling more seats. The airline\\u2019s average seat kilometres (ASK) and revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) for FY13 grew by 17% and 27% respectively from the previous year. Load factors rose from 74.7% to a commendable 81%. The airline, however, saw its costs for FY13 growing much quicker. The losses were pinned on higher fuel costs as the ringgit weakened by 4.7% year-on-year to 3.21 in the fourth quarter even as oil prices fell by 3.7% in the same period to US$129 (RM423) per barrel, noted CIMB Research in a report last week.  The ringgit\\u2019s weak outlook does not bode well for MAS either. As at yesterday, the ringgit had weakened further to 3.2802 against the greenback. In addition, MAS will have to contend with increased competition both domestically and internationally. \\u201cOur survey of announced capacity schedules up to July 2014 indicates that MAS (and AirAsia X Bhd) is struggling to digest a huge expansion of capacity to Australia in late 2013/early 2014, while Malindo Air is launching new routes to India and Thailand, competing directly with MAS. \\u201cHence, fierce domestic competition in 2013 is now spreading internationally in 2014,\\u201d said CIMB Research.

The index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (May 2013) and it represents an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cFlat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cPseudo-Bull\\u201d rise completed.

Our rebound retracement target of 1,839.26 (62% level) may cap the index in the short-\\u00a0 to medium-term. The index must penetrate this key level with high volume to be certain of an eventual test of the 1,882.20 high again.

Due to the rebound tone of the KLCI, we recommend a chart \\u201cbuy\\u201d on Muda Holdings Bhd. Muda made a 52-week high on Wednesday at RM1.73 backed by high volumes suggesting strong investor optimism for its upcoming fourth quarter financial year 2013 (4QFY13) results. Since our first \\u201cbuy\\u201d recommendation on Jan 22 this year, the stock has risen more than 30%.  A check on Bloomberg consensus indicates that no research house has coverage on the stock. The stock is currently trading at a historical price-earnings ratio of 13 times and a low price-to-book value of 0.64 times. Muda announced its 3QFY13 results in November last year which saw a very strong profit after tax growth of 170.5% to RM31.8 million due to a one-off disposal of KL Resources Pte Ltd.  Muda\\u2019s chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly timeframes are very strong indeed. Its share price made an obvious surge since its weekly Wave-2 low of 74 sen in September 2013. Since that 74 sen low, Muda has risen to its recent February 2014 high of RM1.73.  Its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to its recent February 2014 high of RM1.73. As it broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of RM1.30 and RM1.36, look to buy Muda on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to medium-term uptrends for this stock. The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (such as the CCI, DMI, Oscillator and MACD) are very strong and now depict the obvious indications of Muda\\u2019s eventual rise towards much higher levels. We expect Muda to remain very firm towards its support levels of RM1.30, RM1.36 and RM1.63. It will attract minor profit taking at the resistance levels of RM1.73, RM1.85 and RM2.03. Its upside targets are now located at RM2.08, RM2.48 and RM2.83. Lee Cheng Hooi is the regional chartist at Maybank Kim Eng.

At the opening bell, the listing, the second this year after IOI Properties Bhd, saw 7.2 million shares transacted. The stock touched an intraday high of 40 sen before closing at 28.5 sen, up 5.5 sen or 23.91%, with 197.3 million shares changing hands. It was the second most active stock yesterday. SCH managing director Lau Mong Ling said the group is confident of a transfer to the Main Market in two to three years, as it outlines its strategy to increase the share of the domestic quarry market to 22.5% from 17.5% currently. The group also plans to tap into the larger Asean market with its high-end quarry equipment and machinery such as loader machines and quarry crushers, he said. SCH sources its quarry machinery from three key manufacturers, namely Nakayama, Junjin CSM and Alpha Plus. \\u201cThe [profit] margin for these high-end products is better and the turnover sizeable. One machine can easily cost between RM800,000 and RM1 million,\\u201d Lau told reporters after the listing ceremony yesterday. SCH aims to sell its products directly to end users which will provide a better margin control. Lau said the group expects double-digit growth in revenue for the financial year ending Aug 31, 2014 from RM61.25 million a year ago as it expands its product range and explores new business ventures such as quarry design. Lau, together with two other shareholders and co-founders Wong Sin Chin and Yeen Yoon Hin, collectively hold 69% equity interest in SCH Group. SCH supplies quarry industrial products, quarry machinery, quarry equipment and reconditioned quarry machinery as well as spare parts to the quarry industry in Malaysia and Southeast Asia. It is also involved in the manufacturing of quarry grill. The industrial products segment presently contributes over 40% to group revenue, while its reconditioned business accounts for 32%.

RHB Research Institute Sdn Bhd analyst, David Chong, said that Public Bank \"will be impacted most\" from the policy. The impact however, did not seem to be too significant for other banks, Chong said. Maybank's Ch\\u2019ng said, the firm had downgraded its target price for Public Bank shares by 6%, to RM18. This comes with an unchanged \"sell\" call for the stock.  He said that Maybank had maintained its \"sell\" call, due to Public Bank's lofty valuation. \"At a FY14 PER of 15.5x, the stock trades at a 34% premium to its peer average of 11.5x.

Going forward, the research house expects demand for nitrile gloves will maintain its strength, driven by demand from the US and European markets, which are more inclined to pay for quality. \\u201cHowever, there is a constraint to Hartalega\\u2019s earnings growth as its new capacity will only kick in progressively from 4Q14 onwards,\\u201d said Maybank IB.

The SP500 index inched down 3.56 points to close at 1,751.64 points while the Dow fell 5.01 points to end at 15,440.23. Equities markets were roiled in late January as the US Federal Reserve scaled back its quantitative easing programme by another US$10 billion (RM33.2 billion) to US$65 billion per month at the first federal open market committee meeting for 2014. The Fed\\u2019s second taper of US$10 billion since December 2013 caused downward turbulence in most equity markets. The FBM KLCI was not spared.

The index closed at 1,797.90 yesterday, up 12.02 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like DiGi.Com Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd, SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd, PPB Group Bhd and Malayan Banking Bhd caused the index to rebound yesterday. The index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (May 2013) and it represents an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cFlat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cPseudo-Bull\\u201d rise completed.

As such, the index\\u2019s weaker support levels are seen at 1,759, 1,769 and 1,790 points, while the resistance areas of 1,799, 1,838 and all-time high of 1,882\\u00a0 points will witness some very heavy profit taking. Our downside targets of 1,742, 1,730 and 1,682 points for the index in the short to medium term have now emerged out of the bearish price moves since Dec 31, 2013. Its simple moving averages (MA) depict a mixed tone for its chart timeframes. Its daily and weekly charts have turned negative, while the monthly chart appears buoyant for now. Due to its mixed chart signals, we believe investors may adopt a \\u201cTake Profit\\u201d philosophy as the KLCI remains at fairly lofty levels with bearish divergent signals. As such, profit taking on index components as well as small to mid caps will persist this month. Due to the bearish tone of the KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201csell\\u201d on British American Tobacco (M) Bhd (BAT), which is a RM17.36 billion market cap company, the second largest listed entity on the KLCI Consumer Index after PPB Group. BAT\\u2019s return on equity based on its 12-month trailing earnings is 168.6%. A check on some of the current holdings on Bloomberg show institutional funds such as Blackrock and the Employees Provident Fund have taken some profit based on the filings shown. The poorer investor sentiment may be attributed to the large number of \\u201csell\\u201d calls for the stock, which suggest that the stock is most likely fully valued at its current traded price. Looking at the consensus average target price of RM60.12 and no near term catalyst, any upside for the stock may be limited. A check on Bloomberg consensus reveals 19 brokers covering the stock. Two of them have \\u201cbuy\\u201d ratings, 10 \\u201csell\\u201d and seven \\u201chold\\u201d. The stock is currently trading at a historical price-earnings ratio of 20.7 times and a very high price-to-book value of 33.6 times. BAT\\u2019s indicated dividend yield is at a high 4.6%. BAT\\u2019s chart trends on the daily and weekly timeframes are very weak indeed. Its share price made an obvious plunge since its weekly Wave-5 and all-time high of RM68 in May 2013. Since that RM68 high, BAT has declined to its recent June 2013 low of RM56.58. Its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly downtrends to its recent February 2014 low of RM59.50. As it broke above its recent key critical supports of RM63.20 and RM62.60, look to \\u201csell\\u201d BAT on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to medium-term downtrends for this stock. The daily and weekly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, Oscillator, Stochastic and MACD) are very negative and now depict the obvious indications of BAT\\u2019s eventual decline towards much lower levels. We expect BAT to remain very weak towards its support levels of RM56.58, RM58.20 and RM59.50. It will attract major liquidation activities at the resistance levels of RM60.80, RM62.60 and RM68. Its downside targets are now located at RM58.44, RM54.68 and RM53.05. Lee Cheng Hooi is the regional chartist at Maybank Kim Eng.

CIMB Group Holdings Bhd did this on Jan 13 with a private placement of 400 million new shares initially, with an upsize option of 100 million shares in the event of a more-than-expected take-up rate. The new shares were offered at RM7.10, which is at a 2% discount to the volume weighted average price of RM7.26 on Jan 10. Indeed, the response to the capital raising exercise, despite the very short time frame that was involved, was good enough for the banking group to exercise the upsize option, enabling it to place out 500 million shares to successfully raise RM3.55 billion. The new shares were taken up by both domestic and foreign institutions. One would think that this good res\\u00adponse is an indication that investors view this new capital as a positive catalyst for the banking group. Yet, CIMB Group\\u2019s share price performance did not reflect this. In fact, ever since it was re-quoted on Bursa Malaysia on Jan 15 after being suspended on Jan 13, its share price has taken a beating, falling 5.5%. It was the worst-performing stock among the listed banking groups on Bursa, although most banking stocks have not been performing well in recent times. It closed at RM7.09 on Jan 15 and hit a low of RM6.80 on Jan 23 \\u2014 a level close to last year\\u2019s low of RM6.702, recorded on Feb 19. The stock clawed back some ground to close at RM6.90 last Friday. It appears that while the institutional investors who took up the private placement still see a viable proposition in CIMB Group, there are also investors who have decided to vote with their feet to show they don\\u2019t like what is happening. Why this divergent view?  Some industry players say it\\u2019s an issue of perception \\u2014 the suddenness and the speed at which the fund-raising exercise was done had raised speculation that all may not be well in the country\\u2019s second largest banking group, perhaps fuelled by worries that its Indonesian operation via CIMB Niaga is facing some strong headwinds. Of course, the other side of the coin is that for CIMB Group to put together such a huge fund-raising exercise so quickly and push it through with such success is a testament to investor confidence in the stock. Is the selldown in the group\\u2019s shares in recent days justified? At RM6.90, CIMB Group is trading at about 12 times price-earnings ratio based on the forecast earnings for 2013 and a price-to-book value of about 1.7 times. When compared with key industry players such as Malayan Banking Bhd and Public Bank Bhd, CIMB Group\\u2019s valuations are not expensive. If investors are selling because they are worried that CIMB Group\\u2019s balance sheet has been impaired by CIMB Niaga, the concern may be a tad overdone. The banking group has been posting strong earnings growth in recent years. Moving forward, analysts generally expect this uptrend to continue, although the growth momentum this year and the next may not be as strong as before. In fact, the overall banking industry is unlikely to chart the robust growth rates that it did in the last few years. Based on net earnings of RM3.502 billion recorded during the first nine months of 2013, CIMB Group looks set to achieve higher profits for the full year. Net profit for the first three quarters was 7.3% higher than the corresponding period in 2012. Analysts have put 2013 net earnings, which will be released in February, at between RM4.5 billion and RM5.2 billion, compared with RM4.34 billion posted in FY2012 ended Dec 31. CIMB Group, however, has a bigger exposure to Indonesia, where the operating environment has become more treacherous with higher interest rates, a wide current account deficit and a depreciating rupiah. On top of that, the outlook is clouded by a presidential election due this year. Thus, despite CIMB Niaga posting a higher pre-tax profit growth of 2.5% in the first nine months of 2013, the depreciating rupiah has caused its contribution to group earnings in ringgit terms to fall 4% during the period. Indonesia contributes some 30% to CIMB Group\\u2019s earnings, compared with about 10% for Maybank, the other banking group with a huge presence there. While Indonesia has turned more challenging, the outlook isn\\u2019t all doom and gloom as the government there is already taking steps to address the problems. A financial crisis is unlikely, barring black swan events. What will happen is that loans growth will come down from the 30% growth levels to the mid-teens, and asset quality may face some erosion as interest rates rise.  Thus, the fund-raising exercise is a pre-emptive move by CIMB Group to cushion itself against a further weakening in the rupiah, which could prevent it from achieving its internal target of 9.5% to 10% for common equity tier 1 (CET-1) by 2015. We believe this is a wise move given that a further fall in the rupiah could erode the group\\u2019s CET-1 capital to below 8% without the additional RM3.55 billion raised. If the rupiah falls further and CIMB Group fails to meet its internal CET-1 target, the market could become more nervous.  The RM3.55 billion helped boost its CET-1 to 9.7% from the current 8.2%, in line with the industry average of 9.8%. CIMB Group\\u2019s pre-emptive move indicates that apart from the falling rupiah, it is taking a view that going forward, economic prospects both at home and regionally could turn out to be worse than expected. Also, with the US tapering its quantitative easing programmes, capital outflows could be greater than expected, which would have an adverse impact on emerging markets. Interestingly, just before the Asian financial crisis imploded in July 1997, CIMB had completed a rights issue in June, raising RM1.2 billion. This not only enabled the banking group to ride out the crisis but also go on an acquisition trail for cheap assets. Clearly, when there are signs that market conditions are becoming tougher, it is better to be prepared and err on the side of caution.

This article first appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, on February 05, 2014."}, "128": {"date_posted": "30/1/2014", "title": "Highlight: Nitrile gloves continue to show better margins", "article": " GLOVE makers are continuing to ramp up production of nitrile gloves as they compete for market share in the high-margin product in order to satisfy European demand and offset the recent hike in energy prices.  The \\u201cbig four\\u201d glove makers \\u2014 Hartalega Holdings Bhd, Top Glove Corp Bhd,\\u00a0 Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd and Supermax Corp Bhd \\u2014 are moving towards realigning their product mix, putting emphasis on nitrile glove production over that of natural rubber (NR) and vinyl gloves. Top Glove and Hartalega are the leading players in the nitrile segment. Hartalega is the world\\u2019s largest nitrile glove producer with a production capacity of 14 billion pieces per annum while Top Glove currently produces 10 billion pieces. All four firms plan to increase their nitrile production capacity by at least 22% by the end of this year. In a pre-emptive move, Kossan is already gearing up to become the world\\u2019s biggest nitrile producer by end-2015, overtaking both Hartalega and Top Glove in the process. The firm plans to ramp up its capacity by 59% this year to 13.5 billion pieces, from 8.5 billion presently.  As part of its aggressive expansion plan, Kossan recently acquired land in Klang to house its new manufacturing plant, which is expected to add another five billion pieces per annum in capacity. \\u00a0 \\u201cWe hope to have a product mix ratio of 70:30 between nitrile and NR products by the end of this year. There are three new plants in the pipeline, with the first one expected to be operational very soon,\\u201d says Edward Yip, Kossan\\u2019s general manager of corporate affairs and business development, at the Spotlight on Malaysia 2014 forum organised by Bursa Malaysia last week. Nitrile\\u2019s appeal comes from its position as a premium product over NR gloves. Synthetic rubber products have become the preferred choice by consumers due to the increasing prevalence of latex allergies, which may occur with prolonged contact to NR gloves. Hartalega is the clear leader in this segment because of its consistently high utilisation rates and its preference for nitrile production, which contributed 92% of total sales during the first half of its financial year ending March 31, 2014 (1HFY14). Alongside Kossan, Supermax is looking to replicate this strategy with a planned expansion of its nitrile capacity by 128% this year, according to data compiled by Maybank IB Research. While Top Glove plans to increase its own nitrile capacity by 22%, the company is currently encumbered by the margin squeeze in its NR gloves segment due to higher latex prices and low average selling price. Also, it is still seeing operating losses at its manufacturing plants in China.  The rising production of nitrile gloves is an ongoing trend as the product offers higher margins due to its higher selling price. However, with an additional 13 billion pieces expected to hit the market this year, one wonders if it would contribute to an oversupply in the market. In a Jan 16 note, Maybank IB Research says demand will likely come from Europe, where nitrile gloves command a 50% market share, compared with 80% in the US. Global demand is also expected to pick up by 15%-20% this year. \\u201cOver the longer term, the demand for nitrile remains favourable with room for growth. Capacity expansion in 2014 is expected to be led by Kossan and Supermax, which have already put in the infrastructure and secured the gas supply for their production lines,\\u201d it says. Kossan\\u2019s Yip points out that in spite of the recent hike in electricity and gas tariffs, the group remains confident of maintaining its profit margins with its nitrile growth expansion plan. \\u201cWe had already anticipated and prepared for this [energy hikes]. Labour costs also increased by 44% following the minimum wage implementation in July last year, but our margins kept increasing anyway,\\u201d he says. To deal with escalating energy prices, glove makers have raised their ASP by 1% to pass through the higher electricity costs beginning this month.  However, cheaper raw materials, which make up nearly half of the production costs, could ensure that margins remain stable in spite of the energy cost inflation. It is worth noting that latex prices have fallen to a four-year low of RM4.84 per kg due to expectation of rising supply. The main beneficiary of this would be Top Glove as it is the largest NR glove producer, says Maybank IB Research. Analysts say that the persisting nitrile theme may continue to boost the stock prices of the big four firms. CIMB Research has an \\u201coutperform\\u201d call on both Kossan and Supermax, while Maybank IB Research has a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on Kossan and Top Glove. In terms of share price performance, Top Glove has lagged its peers after recording only a 0.65% gain between Jan 2 and Dec 31 last year. During the same period, Kossan\\u2019s shares gained 161%, followed by Hartalega (54%) and Supermax (46%). A useful metric for comparing the production efficiency among the big four glove makers is the gross earnings generated per thousand gloves produced. In the third quarter of last year (3QCY13), Hartalega registered gross earnings of RM28.90 per thousand gloves, followed by Kossan (RM12.50), Supermax (RM10) and Top Glove (RM7.70). According to a Jan 7 note by Alliance Research, the glove makers will be able to continue delivering decent earnings growth this year. \\u201cWe remain optimistic that the glove sector will be able to deliver earnings growth of 14%, underpinned by (1) stable latex costs, (2) weaker ringgit against the USD, and (3) healthy competition which could foster a stronger glove manufacturing industry in Malaysia,\\u201d it says. \\u00a0 While there will be stiff competition among the glove players in the nitrile segment, it is also important to note that having the highest production capacity alone does not necessarily guarantee higher margins.  The firms will have to focus on increasing operational efficiency, as well as making sure that they are not over-leveraged when undertaking aggressive expansion plans.

Earlier in the day, the company announced the proposed disposal of its 30% stake in Duke to Ekovest Bhd for RM228 million cash (see story on pg 4 for full details). Then later in the day, MRCB made another major announcement when it proposed to sell its freehold land and Platinum Sentral in Kuala Lumpur Sentral (KL Sentral) to Quill Capita Trust (QCT) for RM750 million. In an announcement to Bursa Malaysia, MRCB said it will receive RM486 million in cash and new units in QCT worth RM264 million or at an issue price of RM1.32 per unit. Post exercise, MRCB is expected to own approximately 30% to 31% of QCT, with an asset base of approximately RM1.5 billion. Yesterday, MRCB\\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, MRCB Sentral Properties Sdn Bhd (MSP), entered into a heads of agreement (HoA) with Maybank Trustees Bhd, which is acting as the trustee for QCT in the transaction. Platinum Sentral consists of five blocks of four- to seven-storey commercial buildings, comprising office-cum-retail space, a multi-purpose hall and two levels of car park. \\u201cMSP has been informed that QCT may consider funding the cash payment for the proposed disposal via borrowings and/or fund raising via issuance of new units,\\u201d MRCB said in the announcement.

Earlier in the day, the company announced the proposed disposal of its 30% stake in Duke to Ekovest Bhd for RM228 million cash (see story on pg 4 for full details). Then later in the day, MRCB made another major announcement when it proposed to sell its freehold land and Platinum Sentral in Kuala Lumpur Sentral (KL Sentral) to Quill Capita Trust (QCT) for RM750 million. In an announcement to Bursa Malaysia, MRCB said it will receive RM486 million in cash and new units in QCT worth RM264 million or at an issue price of RM1.32 per unit. Post exercise, MRCB is expected to own approximately 30% to 31% of QCT, with an asset base of approximately RM1.5 billion. Yesterday, MRCB\\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, MRCB Sentral Properties Sdn Bhd (MSP), entered into a heads of agreement (HoA) with Maybank Trustees Bhd, which is acting as the trustee for QCT in the transaction. Platinum Sentral consists of five blocks of four- to seven-storey commercial buildings, comprising office-cum-retail space, a multi-purpose hall and two levels of car park. \\u201cMSP has been informed that QCT may consider funding the cash payment for the proposed disposal via borrowings and/or fund raising via issuance of new units,\\u201d MRCB said in the announcement.

Markets rose on optimism after Turkey raised interest rates substantially to support its currency. In Malaysia, fund managers said the KLCI which settled at 1,789.23 at 5pm had also seen a technical rebound. The rise came on gains in stocks like Malayan Banking Bhd and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. Today, Bursa Malaysia saw 1.4 billion shares worth RM1.74 billion changed hands. There were 494 gainers versus 222 decliners. The top gainer was United Plantations Bhd while Hong Leong Capital Bhd led decliners. The most-active stock was KNM Group Bhd. \"It is a technical rebound for the KLCI,\" a fund manager told theedgemalaysia.com over telephone today. He said the KLCI had risen on improving emerging currencies following Turkey's move to raise interest rates after a rout in recent days. Reuters reported that Turkey followed India by tightening policy at a midnight meeting of its central bank, with a huge hike of 425 basis points taking the overnight lending rate all the way to 12 percent. Today, Malaysia's KLCI extended gains after rising 2.37 points or 0.13% to 1,781.25 yesterday. Last Monday (January 27), the KLCI fell 23.69 points or 1.3%. The KLCI had fallen then in anticipation that US policy makers will further reduce quantitative easing (QE) measures, and on concerns about China's economy. These factors had prompted investors to sell emerging market currencies and channel funds to US dollar-denominated assets. Hence, the still-high foreign shareholding in Malaysian government bonds at 45.1% is a crucial concern, Credit Suisse economists said The economists, Michael Wan, Robert Prior-Wandesforde and Santitarn Sathirathai wrote in a note that the current foreign shareholding in Malaysian government bonds follows a 4.4% percentage point reduction since May 2013. \"Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, which were all hit during last year's mini-crisis, but not as much as India and Indonesia, are also better placed in most categories. \"Nevertheless, we still worry about the high level of foreign bond holdings in Malaysia, the political situation in Thailand and low real interest rates in both Thailand and the Philippines,\" the economists said. Today, Bursa Malaysia saw 1.4 billion shares worth RM1.74 billion changed hands. There were 494 gainers versus 222 decliners. The top gainer was United Plantations Bhd while Hong Leong Capital Bhd led decliners. The most-active stock was KNM Group Bhd. Across Asia, Japan's Nikkei climbed 2.7% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.82%\\u00a0 Elsewhere, Singapore's Straits Times however fell 0.37%. Reuters reported that Asian markets rallied on Wednesday after Turkey stunned investors with a huge hike in interest rates, stirring hopes drastic action would short-circuit a vicious cycle of selling in emerging markets and revive risk appetite. Later in the session, the improved mood will face an test from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to trim its asset buying program by another $10 billion a month at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting."}, "132": {"date_posted": "29/1/2014", "title": "Highlight: Is the bullish outlook on UMW-OG justified?", "article": " THE market capitalisation of UMW Oil & Gas Corp Bhd (UMW-OG) has soared although it has only been listed on Bursa Malaysia for less than three months. The group\\u2019s market cap stood at RM9.06 billion on Jan 22 thanks to the gains in its share price, which closed at RM4.19 on the same day. This represents a staggering 49% increase from its initial public offering (IPO) issue price of RM2.80 per share, which implied a total capitalisation of RM6.05 billion. According to UMW-OG president Rohaizad Darus, the incoming deliveries of new jack-up (JU) drilling rigs will boost the group\\u2019s earnings substantially over the next two years. Drilling services contributed 94% to its total revenue for the first nine months of last year (9M2013). \\u201cIt\\u2019s simple mathematics. Our four operational rigs currently generate a certain amount of revenue. If we add another one, our bottom line will increase by 25%,\\u201d he says during a media briefing last Thursday. Rohaizad was referring to Naga 5, the group\\u2019s latest premium JU rig, which is scheduled for delivery in May. UMW-OG has already secured a US$7 million contract from Nido Petroleum Philippines Pty Ltd for the provision of drilling services by the new rig. Apart from its JU fleet, the group is also the sole Malaysian operator of hydraulic workover units (HWUs), with four currently being deployed in three countries on short- and long-term tenures. Coupled with a RM1 billion war chest from its IPO proceeds after deducting last year\\u2019s expenses, Rohaizad is confident that the group can leverage on its working relationship with Petroliam Nasional Bhd and other oil majors to secure new contracts for its JU rigs and HWUs. \\u201cWe believe we are able to finance a significant number of new rigs and also secure new contracts due to the increasing regional demand.\\u201d Despite its recent share price gains, there are contrasting valuations on the company by research houses. According to Bloomberg data, the consensus analyst view is mostly bearish with 9 out of 13 research houses issuing a \\u201cneutral\\u201d or \\u201csell\\u201d rating on UMW-OG. The most bullish are Maybank IB Research and CIMB Research, which set a target price of RM4.80 and RM4.63 respectively. At the other end of the spectrum is Goldman Sachs Research, which set a fair value of a mere RM2.70 on the oil and gas operator. In a Jan 20 note, Maybank IB argues that the delivery of another two JU rigs \\u2014 Naga 6 and Naga 7 \\u2014 by 2015 warrants a premium valuation on the stock. At RM4.80 per share, the research firm has pegged UMW-OG\\u2019s shares at 23 times projected earnings for FY2015. In its calculations, Maybank IB projected that UMW-OG\\u2019s core net profit and core earnings per share will triple within two years after taking into account the additional revenue boost from the three upcoming JU rigs. \\u201cThe market now demands new, premium JUs, favoured for their superior security, cost and operating features. More importantly, UMW-OG has the balance sheet strength to expand its JU fleet size beyond the projected five units,\\u201d it says. However, it is worth noting that new contracts are the lifeblood of oil and gas companies. UMW-OG\\u2019s contract backlog stands at RM1.45 billion, a small figure compared with the order books of other big caps such as SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd (RM28 billion) and Bumi Armada Bhd (RM10.8 billion), says Alliance Research, which has a \\u201csell\\u201d call on the stock, pegging the fair value at RM3.16. The research outfit says UMW-OG\\u2019s valuation has exceeded its peers, whose shares are currently trading at lower price-earnings multiples. \\u201cWhile the growth outlook for UMW-OG is promising, especially if the group adds on new rigs, we view that valuations have run too far ahead of peers at this juncture,\\u201d it says. At the moment, a huge chunk of UMW-OG\\u2019s revenue comes from contracts awarded by Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd (PCSB), with three out of four rigs deployed for the upstream player\\u2019s needs. Apart from PCSB, UMW-OG\\u2019s client base for the JU rigs consists of HESS, Japan Vietnam Petroleum Co and Nido Petroleum. Underlining its regional expansion plans, Rohaizad says the group is working towards achieving a 50-50 revenue contribution from domestic and overseas operations respectively. For 9M2013, 66% of its revenue came from Malaysia. \\u201cNaga 3 will be moved to Vietnam while Naga 5 will be operating in the Philippines, where we have never been to before. We also have a presence in China, Thailand, Indonesia and Turkmenistan in various capacities.\\u201d The bullish outlook is mainly supported by the upcoming expiration of a whopping 41 JU rig contracts in Southeast Asia this year. In Malaysia, there are currently 18 JUs, of which 16 are foreign owned. In line with the growing demand, daily charter rates for JUs have accordingly risen over the past four years. According to Maybank IB, average day rates are now holding steadily at US$150,000 and should rise to between US$160,000 and US$170,000 levels due to the favourable oil price environment as well as a mismatch between demand and supply. However, it is apparent that the group will have to aggressively expand its operations and secure new contracts on a consistent basis, either one of which is no small task. The drilling services industry also remains highly competitive, and there is no shortage of international oil and gas operators bidding for the same projects that UMW-OG is gunning for. UMW-OG will be spending its cash pile on two new rigs \\u2014 Naga 6 and Naga 7. Will Petronas, which is the company\\u2019s major client, also deploy the new jack-up rigs? That will determine whether the bullishness on the stock is justifiable.

China\\u2019s growth outlook even posed a risk to countries such as Australia that rely on trade with it. The Australian markets fell over 1% as a result.  In Asia, the Hang Seng and Nikkei-225 indices also led the regional market losses.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Asia\\u2019s losses came after the American markets ended Wednesday mixed in lacklustre trading. IBM, AMD and Coach posted lower revenue numbers. The SP500 index inched up 1.06 points to close at 1,844.86 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 41.10 points to end at 16,373.34. In Malaysia, the FBM KLCI traded in a downward range of 15.63 points for the week with volumes of 1.52 billion to 1.84 billion done. The index closed at 1,808.31 yesterday, down 5.79 points from Wednesday as blue-chip stocks such as British American Tobacco (M) Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd, PPB Group Bhd and RHB Capital Bhd caused the index to decline on foreign selling yesterday. The index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (May 2013) and it represented an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cFlat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cPseudo-Bull\\u201d rise completed.  The price movements in the index in the months following May 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low) and 1,882.20 (high). The index\\u2019s daily signals are mainly negative. The CCI, DMI, Oscillator and MACD are negative while the Stochastic is positive. As such, the index\\u2019s weaker support levels are seen at 1,759, 1,780 and 1,801 points, while the resistance areas of 1,808, 1,838 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some heavy profit-taking activities.  Our downside targets of 1,795, 1,760 and 1,730 for the index in the short term have now emerged out of the bearish price moves since Dec 31, 2013. Its simple moving averages (MA) depict a mixed tone for its chart time frames. Its daily chart has turned negative, while the weekly chart is neutral but the monthly chart appears buoyant for now.  Due to its mixed chart signals, we believe investors may adopt a \\u201ctake profit\\u201d philosophy as the KLCI remains at fairly lofty levels with bearish divergent signals. As such, profit-taking on index components as well as small to mid caps will persist into the next fortnight before and after the Chinese New Year holidays. Concerns over the local higher bond yields (especially on the 10-year bonds), a consistent weaker tone for regional currencies against the US dollar and persistent foreign fund equity selling may keep the index and local markets under further pressure for a potential decline. Due to the lofty tone of the KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201csell\\u201d on KPJ Healthcare Bhd, which is a RM3.4 billion market cap company with a return on equity of 10.3% based on its 12-month trailing earnings. It seems that the recent weakening of the ringgit and the downward KLCI movement are causing investors to shift towards a more defensive position towards more cash.  Despite KPJ being a healthcare bellwether, it was not spared. The steady decline in its stock price could be attributed to weaker profitability and losses at the group\\u2019s three newly opened hospitals, namely KPJ Bandar Baru Klang, KPJ Pasir Gudang and PT Khasanah Putera Jakarta Medica. Maybank IB does not have fundamental coverage on KPJ. A check on Bloomberg consensus reveals 13 brokers have coverage on the stock, with two brokers having a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the stock, six \\u201csell\\u201d calls and five \\u201chold\\u201d. The stock is currently trading at a lofty historical price-earnings ratio of 30 times and a price-to-book value of 3.3 times. KPJ\\u2019s indicated dividend yield is at a low 1.86%. KPJ\\u2019s chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames are weak indeed. Its share price made an obvious plunge since its monthly Wave-2 high of RM4.14 in December 2013. Since that high, KPJ declined to its recent January 2014 low of RM3.30.  Its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly downtrends to its recent low of RM3.30. As it broke above its recent key critical supports of RM4.23 and RM4.02, look to sell KPJ on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term downtrends for this stock.  The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI and MACD) are negative and now depict the obvious indications of KPJ\\u2019s eventual decline to much lower levels.  We expect KPJ to remain weak towards its support levels of RM3.04, RM3.11 and RM3.30. It will attract major liquidation activities at the resistance levels of RM3.52, RM4.02 and RM4.23. Its downside targets are now located at RM2.89, RM2.13 and RM2.00.Lee Cheng Hooi is the regional chartist at Maybank Kim Eng.

The government yesterday announced its long-awaited revised policy on the auto sector, which targets to reduce car prices by 20% to 30% in five years. The NAP contains measures to increase competition in the auto sector, particularly in the energy-efficient vehicle (EEV) segment. The policy\\u2019s main objective is to make Malaysia the regional automotive hub for EEV. The freeze on new manufacturing licences for cars below 1,800cc would be lifted, but only for EEV. The government hopes to issue three to four manufacturing licences for EEV by 2018. The government will also provide RM2.07 billion in funds over seven years to attract foreign and domestic investments in the EEV segment. There will be no investment and equity conditions imposed on the new manufacturing licences. In a note today, CIMB Research commented that the NAP raises more questions than it clears doubts. \\u201cAfter an 18-month delay, the NAP 2014 was a disappointment. It did not contain an end-of-life vehicle (ELV) policy and extended the timeline to end the open approved permit (AP) system. \\u201cExcise duties will not be cut and the projected 20-30% reduction in the average car prices over the next five years is already in motion, with ASEAN localisation and lower import duties,\\u201d said the research house. The most notable incentive is the tax and duty exemption for all hybrid and CKD electric vehicles, in line with the government\\u2019s aim of making Malaysia an energy efficient vehicle (EEV) production hub. \\u201cThis reinforces Tan Chong as our top pick. But we maintain \\u2018neutral\\u2019 on the sector.\\u201d HwangDBS Vickers Research commented that the NAP 2014 lacks details, but noted Honda already has the first mover advantage. \\u201cThere was pledged gradual 20-30% car price reduction by 2017, but with no review of the current high excise duties.\\u201d Expressing \\u201cdisappointments\\u201d that there was no review of AP (open and franchise), HwangDBS said this has led to more leakages for manufacturers. HwangDBS said its top pick is DRB-Hicom Bhd (Target price: RM3.50) as it has a wide range of marques and credible Proton turnaround plan. In a note, Maybank Investment Bank said: \\u201cThe key measures announced were as expected. The intention to make Malaysia a regional hub for EEV is noble but we think it lacks clarity for now.\\u201d But unlike CIMB, HwangDBS, and Maybank IB, the new NAP was seen as \\u201ccatalysing a super-cycle growth story\\u201d by AmResearch which gives an \\u201coverweight\\u201d rating on the sector. \\u201cWe sense that the NAP is now more outward looking, thrusted by Malaysia\\u2019s EEV program, which encompasses a competitive tax incentive structure, a focus on scale creation and creation of a competitive export hub.\\u201d It said the revised NAP will prove a strategic turning point for the local auto industry, riding on early cycle investments into \\u201cgreen car\\u201d production in ASEAN. And the critical factors behind its bullish view are:-(1) a much more robust option for foreign OEMs to qualify for \\u201cgreen car\\u201d production tax incentives; (2) EEV tax incentives will give a quantum leap to the current level of localisation-driven excise duty rebate; (3) huge spin-off impact; non-EEV models sharing common parts with EEV models; (4) complete liberalisation of auto manufacturing license for EEV production; and (5) massive scale from new capacity to improved price competency of Malaysian auto parts sector. On stock picks, AmResearch said BAuto is its top pick as a play into the green theme (BUY, FV: RM2.30/share). DRB-Hicom (BUY, FV: RM3.65/share) is seen as a beneficiary via its stake in 34% owned Honda Malaysia.

This placement was a surprise for CIMB had earlier informed analysts it would rely on its dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) to gradually build its CET-1 ratio to 10% by 2015. Some analysts interpret the capital raising now as a proactive move by CIMB to brace for possible difficult times ahead in its regional ventures. Though most see the move as positive for CIMB Group per se as its capital issue will be addressed, they cut the earnings per share (EPS) of the stock and target price as the EPS will be diluted by the issuance of new shares. \\u201cThe exercise is more likely to boost capital after sharp Rupiah depreciation.\\u00a0 Moreover, CIMB Niaga\\u2019s asset quality (in Indonesia) may continue to show uptick.

Naim said the proceeds from the disposal would be utilised for working capital of the company. It said the company held 33.63% equity interest in Dayang prior to the disposal. The Sarawak company said based on the unaudited consolidated quarter report of Naim as at Sept 30, 2013, the proforma effects of the disposal on the net asset per share and gearing of Naim are expected to improve to RM3.77 and 0.38 times, from RM3.52 and 0.40 times, respectively. \\u201cNaim expects to record a proforma gain of about RM62 million from the disposal in the current year.\\u201d CYL Corporation Bhd announced that the company has declared an interim tax exempt dividend of 4% amounting to RM2 million in respect of the financial year ending 31 January 2014.

The index closed at 1,828.21 yesterday, down 3.09 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like IOI Corp Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, CIMB Bank Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd caused the index to decline on profit taking activities yesterday. The index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (October 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (May 2013) and it represented an extended Elliott Wave \\u201cFlat\\u201d rebound in a \\u201cPseudo-Bull\\u201d rise completed. The index price movements in the next few months following May 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low) and 1,882.2 (high). The index\\u2019s daily signals are mixed. The CCI and MACD are negative while the DMI, Oscillator and Stochastic are positive. As such, the index\\u2019s obvious support levels are seen at the 1,780, 1,800 and 1,822 levels, whilst the resistance areas of 1,828, 1,849 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some heavy profit-taking activities. Our upside targets of 1,898, 1,900 and 1,924 for the index in the medium term may be deferred for now. Its simple moving averages (MA) depict a double time frame (weekly and monthly) uptrend for now. Its daily chart has turned into a neutral position in January 2014. Due to its mixed signals, we believe investors may adopt a \\u201crange trading\\u201d philosophy as the KLCI remains at fairly lofty levels with bearish divergent signals. As such, profit-taking on index components as well as small to mid caps may persist into the next fortnight. Despite the lofty tone of the KLCI, we are recommending a chart \\u201cbuy\\u201d on MKH Bhd, which is a RM1.1 billion market cap company with a return on equity of 12% based on its 12-month trailing earnings. The stock made a new recent high of RM3.27 in tandem with the improving sentiment of the small and mid cap property stocks. It seems that the recent recurring theme from the property segment is the asset revaluation approach, where investors favour property companies with strategic landbank with development potential.  The firm rise in the stock price can be attributed to investors\\u2019 optimism on its strong earnings trend led by the plantation and property and construction division. For the fourth quarter of financial year 2013 ended Sept 30, MKH\\u2019s group revenue rose 21%. The rise was attributed to its plantation division\\u2019s higher sales of crude palm oil and palm kernel, as well as the property and construction division\\u2019s revenue from ongoing and new developments. Despite the better profitability, profit before tax was lower due to an inclusion of foreign exchange losses in the current quarter totalling RM63 million due to a weakening rupiah and ringgit against the US dollar. Maybank-IB does not have fundamental coverage on MKH. A check on Bloomberg consensus revealed that three brokers have coverage on the stock, with all having a \\u201cbuy\\u201d call on the stock.  The stock is currently trading at a reasonable historical price-earnings ratio of 10 times and a price-to-book value of 1.2 times. MKH\\u2019s indicated dividend yield is at 3.14%. Its chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly timeframes are very strong indeed. Its share price made an obvious surge since its monthly Wave-2 low of 57 sen in October 2008. Since that 57 sen low, MKH surged to its recent January 2014 high of RM3.27.  Its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to the recent high of RM3.27. As it broke above its recent key critical resistances of RM2.62 and RM2.85, look to buy MKH on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to long term uptrends for this stock.  The daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the CCI, DMI, MACD and Oscillator) are very strong and now depict the obvious indications of MKH\\u2019s eventual surge to higher levels. We expect MKH to remain very firm towards its support levels of RM2.62, RM2.85 and RM3.10.  It will attract minor profit taking at the resistance levels of RM3.27, RM3.58 and RM4.13.

Nevertheless, downside is likely limited, a consequence of the trapped domestic liquidity. We see pockets of trading opportunity given the potential crystallisation of stock-specific catalysts in 2014. The possibility of a price war heading into 2014 cannot be entirely dismissed, particularly after the management restructuring at Maxis Bhd. Nevertheless, the new chief executive officer\\u2019s statement that Maxis will not compete on pricing was a welcome relief. We thus expect competition among the cellular majors to remain rational in the next 12 months. This will allow the companies to continue to focus on further monetising data. The growth in data usage is both explosive and secular, driven by: (i) increased users; (ii) faster Internet access; and (iii) improved content. For fixed-line players, we continue to expect growth in data revenue to more than offset falling voice revenue. With Maxis re-evaluating its integrated model, the competitive intensity in the fibre broadband segment could potentially decline.

Against 2013\\u2019s gain of 10.54% for the KLCI, research houses\\u2019 targets for 2014 appear slightly muted. A look at some research houses\\u2019 KLCI targets for 2014 showed year-end forecasts ranging from 1,920 to 2,030 points, with CIMB Research having the most optimistic forecast. The research house cited a well-executed Economic Transformation Programme as a key catalyst for its optimism in the broader market as well as more subdued political risks after the 13th general election. Maybank Investment Bank Research, which has a KLCI target of 1,940 points, pointed out that Malaysia\\u2019s strong macro-economic fundamentals and corporate balance sheet strength bodes well despite expensive valuations for Malaysian equities. \\u201cPolitical concerns have diminished, fiscal balance issues are being addressed and domestic liquidity remains ample. \\u201cWhile the KLCI\\u2019s16.3 times one-year forward PER [price-earnings ratio] on an 8.1% earnings growth offering implies a rather \\u2018pricey\\u2019 price-earnings to growth of two times, the sustainability of Malaysia\\u2019s longer term growth on strong macro-economic policies and banking and corporate balance sheet strength will continue to lend support to the premium rating,\\u201d said the research house in its strategy report. \\u201cWe expect Malaysian equities\\u2019 defensiveness to stand out yet again amid external volatilities in 2014, albeit at a milder level with the US QE [quantitative easing] taper being priced in,\\u201d it added. The seven research houses\\u2019 targets averaged out to 1,957, equating to a 4.8% increase for the index, which closed at 1,866.96 on Tuesday. This is lower than the 10.54% increase in the KLCI in 2013. The lower growth expectations came amidst concerns mainly of a pullback of foreign funds as a result of Federal Reserve tapering of its quantitative easing policy and poorer consumer sentiment due to fiscal consolidation. A pullback in foreign investor funds in Asian markets is expected after the Fed announced its decision to taper by US$10 billion (RM32.8 billion) per month to US$75 billion starting this month, with the expectation that it occurs at a modest pace in 2014. \\u201cThere could be a pullback in terms of foreigners investing in this part of the region, but that\\u2019s only temporary \\u2026 the Fed is tapering gradually, which is the right strategy,\\u201d said investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management Sdn Bhd, Bharat Joshi. Nomura Equity Research warned that Malaysia, along with Indonesia, India and Thailand appear to be the most vulnerable to a \\u201cdisorderly QE unwind\\u201d scenario. \\u201cThis is due to higher than average equity inflows to local stocks since 2011, non-financial sector corporate net debt, and economy-wide private-sector debt,\\u201d it said. Michael Kurtz, global head of equity strategy at Nomura Equity Research, said that the best performing sectors in 2014 are likely to be externally focused. \\u201cWe are not negative on domestic cyclical stocks per se \\u2014 Malaysia is one of the economies we feel more confident with, along with Philippines and South Korea,\\u201d he said in a phone interview with The Edge Financial Daily. \\u201cHowever, defensive stocks such as telcos, utilities and consumer staples are likely to underperform in 2014 and we have recently downgraded telcos to underweight,\\u201d he said. According to Bharat, the education and healthcare sector are key focus areas in Malaysian equities for 2014, while consumer staples and telcos are on the wary watchlist. \\u201cGenerally, investors are looking at where Malaysia\\u2019s strengths are \\u2014 Malaysia wants to be the education and healthcare hub, and the reason for that is because we have plenty of landbank. \\u201cWe are tapping on both Singapore\\u2019s expensive healthcare \\u2014 where we see Singaporeans coming over to Johor \\u2014 and benefiting from the setting up of education hubs in Johor and private schools around Kuala Lumpur,\\u201d said Bharat. \\u201cWell-to-do Indonesians who are looking for good healthcare but who do not wish to pay Singapore prices are coming to Malaysia,\\u201d he said. On the education sector, he said education providers who are keen on expanding are an indicator of the positive outlook on the sector, pointing to Epsom College set up by AirAsia Bhd\\u2019s Tan Sri Tony Fernandes. Bharat said: \\u201cThe government is also trying to push Visit Malaysia 2014 \\u2014 we are seeing theme parks coming into the market and that could be a pull factor.  \\u201cIncreased tourism should play quite a role because when local domestic consumption slows, they can easily take over and that\\u2019s quite crucial because we still need to iron the chains of consumption \\u2014 if people are not consuming, at least your tourism sector picks up, so that\\u2019s positive. \\u201cWhat we are going to see is more intra-Asean trade in certain sectors taking a role rather than FDIs from the West coming into the market,\\u201d he said, adding that he foresees consumer staples, property and REITs underperforming in the coming year. Meanwhile, most research houses are \\u201cneutral\\u201d on the telco sector due to intensifying competition, decline in SMS revenues and increased capital expenditure. They remain bullish on oil and gas, construction, aviation and utilities. The sectors most have a cautious view on are consumer, property, automotive and gaming. Nevertheless, CIMB is bullish on gaming and property. It said it believes the government\\u2019s measures to curb speculation will be short lived and buyers\\u2019 appetite will return in the second half of 2014. Meanwhile, Bharat is \\u201cneutral\\u201d on telcos and consumers. \\u201cI would say that consumer names which have been very strong this year and the last would see some profit taking \\u2014 companies the likes of Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd, Dutch Lady Milk Industries Bhd, Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd might experience some headwinds in terms of being able to grow their topline, so they would be the ones that might see some profit-taking as valuations for the consumer sector are not cheap,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI think that the outlook for 2014 is going to be slightly below expectations and a lot more cautious\\u00a0 and the reason for that is because there is a lot more challenges, both external and internal,\\u201d he added.
