and why? read on for their replies. see kok loong\ndirector, metro homes sdn bhd what is your wish for malaysia baru?\nmy wish is that the new government will focus on safety, education and healthcare. we need concrete steps to reduce crime and make malaysia one of the safest countries to live in. we need to ensure that the standard of public education is close to the world standard so the next generation can help the country progress further. there is also a need put aside politics in education and focus on ensuring that all malaysians get high quality education. the government should also ensure high-quality healthcare for all citizens. the first parliamentary session assured us that institutional reforms will be carried out. i hope the leaders are prudent in ensuring that we have a good balance of development progress and reduction of government debt. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\naffordable housing is the most important issue currently. there is a need to ensure that every eligible malaysian can afford to buy a home. the government should have proper planning for each development to make sure there is real demand so that there will be no mismatch. oversupply might be disastrous for the economy. the government should also ensure proper enforcement so as to avoid having abandoned projects. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\nkl railway station and railway administration building are my favourite buildings. the former was built in 1910 and the latter, 1917, by british colonial architects. both are well maintained. i still remember taking the train to singapore from here in the 1980s. the kl railway station has witnessed the progress of kl. although most people take public transport at kl sentral now, the old station remains a beautiful piece of history and architecture.  eddy wong\nmanaging director, nawawi tie leung what is your wish for malaysia baru?\nwith the change in government, we are starting a new chapter, full of hope and anticipation.\ni wish for the country to be united as one, where we are all malaysians, regardless of race, language or religion. where we can live in harmony without fear or favour, where the rule of law applies equally to everyone. where good governance is not a privilege but is to be expected from our leaders, and meritocracy is our guiding principle for decisions and policies.\nwe need to be relevant and competitive in the global arena. this is the only way to ensure an exciting and prosperous future for each and every one of us. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\naffordable housing, high household debt and the oversupply situation in the residential, office and retail market sectors. to resolve the affordable housing issue, we must not only look at the supply and the facilitation of the development of affordable homes, but also the demand by raising the income levels of the population. in order to raise income levels, we must review the quality of education in the country. education should not be politicised; only by equipping the population with the right skills and knowledge through education, and with improved productivity, can we raise income levels and achieve the home ownership dreams of our rakyat. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\ni grew up in johor baru and one historic building that stands out is bangunan sultan ibrahim on bukit timbalan. the former state secretariat buildings design and architecture reflects a combination of johor malay, islamic and colonial influences, which not only gives it its uniqueness but also a majestic aura. it is certainly an iconic landmark in johor baru.  james wong\ndirector, vpc alliance (kl) sdn bhd what is your wish for malaysia baru?\ni would like the government to come up with a national housing policy so that every person will have a home, an integrated and affordable public transport system for every city and major town and a greener environment with the planting of more trees, reducing the use of plastic and cutting pollution. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nwe need to build more affordable housing to cater for demand, address the mismatch between supply, demand, location and property pricing by increasing supply in the right property sectors and building more homes in areas where there is demand. we also should reduce property prices by having clearer planning guidelines, reducing red tape and implementing the industrialised building system. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\nkellies castle in batu gajah, perak, stands out for me. built in 1915, the six-storey english castle with scottish, moorish and indian architecture was to have a lift and a basement cellar. scottish planter william kellie smith built the castle to persuade his wife, agnes, to live in malaya but unfortunately, he died before he could finish it, in 1926.  lim poh yit\ndeputy group managing director, titijaya land bhd what is your wish for malaysia baru?\ni wish for a government that places importance on its people. racial harmony and high religious tolerance should be a priority moving forward. only then can the country progress and make an impact on the world stage. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nthe loan rejection rate is currently very high, so, many people cannot afford to purchase a property of their own. the gap between affordable homes and buyers expectations is also an issue; low-cost housing should not necessarily compromise on quality. lastly, the process of buying homes is too tedious  a qualified buyer has to deal with various agencies. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\npanggung bandaraya dbkl in kuala lumpur. besides its beautiful architecture, it also plays a significant role in promoting malaysias performing arts and culture industry. these historic buildings need to be preserved for their long and rich cultural heritage.  sarena cheah\nmanaging director, property division, sunway bhd what is your wish for malaysia baru?\nmy wish is for all of us to do our part, learning from our past successes and failures, in starting a new chapter to strengthen our countrys foundation

income growth to support a more robust market economy while working on initiatives to help all malaysians own their first home. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\nthe sultan abdul samad building, which faces merdeka square, is a prominent landmark where the nation declared its independence on aug 31, 1957. it continues to be a popular destination for all malaysians

(johor) sdn bhd what is your wish for malaysia baru?\ni wish for malaysians to live harmoniously. each person should be given an equal opportunity to prosper in this nation. policies implemented must benefit the people. corruption must be erased and the culprits must be caught and punished. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nthe three pressing issues are oversupply, affordability and balanced development. oversupply of certain property types causes an imbalance in the ecosystem, which is unhealthy. affordability is the availability of houses that are within the purchasing power of buyers. increasingly, houses are getting out of reach of the average man on the street. balanced development means ensuring growth is spread to other areas apart from the growth corridors. there will be opportunities for all to enjoy the fruits of economic growth. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\nin johor, bangunan bukit timbalan is an outstanding historic building that embraces the rich past of the state. it was used as the state administrative centre as well as the command centre during the japanese occupation. it is a very visible landmark that can be seen from singapore and its unique design showcases the rich johor architecture.  sarkunan subramaniam\nmanaging director, knight frank malaysia what is your wish for malaysia baru?\nmy wish is for malaysia to be a harmonious and racially tolerant country that practises transparency and accountability. moving forward, politicians should argue with merit. also, i wish may 9 could be declared liberation day because we were truly liberated by people power. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nfirst is housing affordability. owning a house gives people a greater sense of security. second, improving the countrys economy. this can be done by bringing foreign investors into the high-end residential and big-ticket investment markets. lastly, cutting red tape in land development and reducing compliance costs. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\nbok house in jalan ampang, kuala lumpur. the building is gone but it is vividly clear in my memory. it was a beautiful building that featured classical european architecture. also, the widely believed love story behind this mansion amazes me.  datuk ewe swee kheng\ndeputy executive chairman & group managing director, ewein bhd what is your wish for malaysia baru?\nit is uplifting to see that the new government has brought the people so much hope and spirit. i hope that it will deliver on its promises and create new policies that can improve the property market. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nslow income growth versus demand for affordable housing has been an issue for many years now. despite more developers venturing into the affordable housing segment, many of the new generation of buyers are still adopting a wait-and-see approach. the term affordable housing also needs to be looked into more deeply and redefined, if necessary. as so many of the houses in this category are being introduced and marketed, it may create unrealistic expectations among consumers, which leads to lower buying interest as well as higher loan rejection rates. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\nwithout a doubt, fort cornwallis on penang island is my favourite. it has a long and interesting history. built in 1786, the fort has never been engaged in combat and has now become a prime tourist attraction.  datuk christopher boyd\nexecutive chairman, savills malaysia what is your wish for malaysia baru?\nmalaysia needs much more job-generating investment. nothwithstanding the change in government, potential investors, both domestic and foreign, need to feel confident that malaysia is embarking on a long period of political stability. that is my wish for malaysia baru. stability, investment (particularly foreign direct investment) and prosperity. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nmalaysia has no major property problems. oversupply in some sectors will right itself in time. however, i would like to see: which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\nmy favourite historic place is merdeka square. overlooked by bukit aman and bounded by the sultan abdul samad building, the royal selangor club, st marys cathedral and what was once one of malaysias earlier banks, it is a living history book. it tells the story of the citys colonial rule, hardship, floods, fires, wars and eventual independence and prosperity.  ngan chee meng\nceo and managing director, gamuda land what is your wish for malaysia baru?\nan inclusive malaysia and a transparent and effective government. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nthe governments role in rolling out affordable homes, as property affordability is largely associated with social inequality. better connectivity so that developments can expand into suburbs and people can still commute to the city with ease. a good transport infrastructure will reduce the cost of living for people who choose to live in the suburbs instead of the city. everyone deserves equal access to a greener living environment and the government should promote this for all development projects. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\nto me, it will always be the sultan abdul samad building opposite dataran merdeka. it is an iconic and beautiful heritage landmark that all malaysians can relate to.  previndran singhe\nceo, zerin properties what is your wish for malaysia baru?\na malaysia for all malaysians. an improved education system, talented malaysians who are nurtured to reach new heights, good morals. respect for one another, humility and kindness to be the pillars of future

the way for a sustainable property industry, with a strong focus on the rakyat. this, plus proper structure and local plans, will give a quality lifestyle to all malaysians. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\nthe 121-year-old bangunan sultan abdul samad! its sheer indo-saracenic beauty, its history and its location at the confluence of the gombak and klang rivers truly take you back to the pre-independence era. it was at one time the biggest building in malaya. the country was governed from here!  billy ong\ngroup managing director, ocr group bhd what is your wish for malaysia baru?\ni hope malaysia will move forward from the old chapter and start building a stronger malaysia baru to improve living standards and shine again in the region. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nthey are affordability, supply of affordable housing and economic uncertainties. the development costs, which include land, construction and compliance, have increased tremendously over the years. this has been the main hurdle for developers to price their products competitively. the affordability gap has become wider as income growth has slowed. over the years, there have been good efforts on the part of certain government agencies to increase the supply of affordable housing. however, more effort should be put into studying the income and demographic profile of households in particular locations before any project is launched. economic uncertainties also affect the overall demand in the property market. purchasers are more sensible in making decisions in the current market, so property developers must ensure that they launch the right properties to meet the demand. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\ni do not have a favourite historical building, but i think it is important to preserve such buildings because of their historical and cultural value.  edward chong\nmanaging director, ijm land bhd what is your wish for malaysia baru?\nmy wish is for all malaysians to stay positive, embrace the future with confidence, live together in peace and harmony and have access to a quality home.

for malaysia baru?\nas a malaysian, i wish that we can value and appreciate each other. i look forward to seeing all malaysians realising the importance of each other in building the nation and creating malaysia baru. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nthe government and private sector should work together to provide better housing schemes for the public. the foreign workers policy should be looked at to smooth out construction activities. also, developers are facing hefty compliance costs such as utilities contributions and other authorities requirements. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\nmy favourite historic building is the stadthuys, or the red house, in melaka. built in 1650, it is the oldest dutch building that is still standing in the east. the fact that it is still standing strong shows the quality of the workmanship back then.  datuk zamani kasim\nceo, astaka padu sdn bhd what is your wish for malaysia baru?\nimproved racial integration and an enhanced malaysian identity. we need to create stricter laws to punish those who make racially charged comments, especially politicians. the government should rationalise the development objectives of the country for the rakyat, especially the poor, and low and middle-income, rather than showing strong economic indicators whose benefits are not realised by the rakyat. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nthe government should promote sustainable development and caring for the environment to benefit the current and future rakyat. corruption needs to be wiped out completely. the education system needs to be reviewed to create well-balanced individuals. review the approach to and implementation of affordable housing. singapores housing development board is a proven example. business and economic development targets should be further enhanced. tracking of implementation needs to be improved to ensure that targets are met and jobs are created to meet current and future demand. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\nthe malay traditional home is my favourite. it is green, adapts to the climate and culture, and is aesthetically pleasing. ezumi harzani ismail\npresident, pertubuhan akitek malaysia (pam) what is your wish for malaysia baru?\nto end corruption. we should focus on improving financial management and contract procurement, and curbing abuse of power by local authorities. these are the areas that are always prone to corruption.\nthere is also a need to reinvest in good education and reinstate the budget for higher education that was previously cut.\nwhat are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nover-regulation in the housing industry is limiting its growth. and there is a mismatch between demand and supply of lower and mid-range properties. restrictive financial rulings limit property ownership. tighten rules over other types of spending, but not on purchase of property. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\nthe sultan abdul samad building opposite dataran merdeka in kuala lumpur. the icon was fully restored to its original condition by me and my team at arkitek maa sdn bhd in 2008. built in 1897, it was a government office before becoming a courthouse.  datuk sri amrin awaluddin\ngroup managing director, sime darby property what is your wish for malaysia baru?\nsime darby property hopes to contribute towards building a great nation that can punch above its weight globally. we are a country with great potential and our diverse communities must come together for nation building. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\naffordable housing for first-time homebuyers, unsold stock and the rising cost of doing business. sime darby property will ensure that our products are offered at the right time with the right price, given the soft market. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\nit is the iconic stadthuys building in melaka. it has evergreen architecture and is solidly built. it is still standing although it was built more than 360 years ago. stadthuys is the oldest remaining dutch colonial building in asia. it has a rich past that blends well with melakas local culture and historic

in the foot. its time for a paradigm shift from affirmative policies to meritocracy, and to develop and provide fair opportunities for all malaysians. our education system should impart skills, inspire ingenuity and cultivate values of love and acceptance. education is a necessity that needs to be enhanced. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nhouse unaffordability could lead to social illnesses. this requires multi-level commitment to streamline actions, reduce red tape and compliance, and elevate incomes. gazette local and structure plans for transparent practices, revisit the town planning act and requirements for sustainable development. lastly, improve the efficiency of the public transport system. make it more accessible and affordable. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\nafter 61 years, malaysia is renewing its aspiration to embrace diversity. kampung kling mosque, cheng hoon teng temple and sri poyyatha vinayagar moorthi temple  all located within a stones throw of each other in jalan tokong, melaka  reflect our embodiment of diversity 300 years ago, long before we called ourselves malaysians.  tang chee meng\ncoo, henry butcher (m) sdn bhd what is your wish for malaysia baru?\nit is my wish that, learning from the mistakes and shortcomings of the previous administration, the new government will be able to get the country back on track to become a developed and progressive nation based on policies that are transparent, equitable, non-discriminatory and people-centric. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nthe three issues are providing every malaysian with accommodation that is not necessarily based on the ownership model, relaxing lending guidelines but ensuring that the household debt ratio is still manageable and ensuring that projects are not overburdened by excessive costs to keep prices in check. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\nmy favourite is the moorish-styled sultan abdul samad building. it is an iconic and historic landmark in kuala lumpur and a popular tourist attraction, especially since it is located opposite the tudor-style selangor club and dataran merdeka.  michael geh\npresident, fiabci malaysian chapter what is your wish for malaysia baru?\nwe should emphasise doing things right from the outset. what we have been doing all this while is very wrong and there is a need to change mindsets. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nlowering all costs in the delivery of affordable housing is vital, as is making available loans for affordable housing. our building construction system has remained the same over the last decade and we need to have modern construction systems such as ibs (industrial building system) and bim (building information system) in place for better efficiency in building management. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\nbangunan sultan abdul samad, which is most visible during parades and is widely televised.  sulaiman saheh\nhead of research, rahim & co what is your wish for malaysia baru?\nwith a vision of attaining a more liveable and happier all-inclusive-malaysia, i wish for a more equitable, sustainable and transparent system that is adaptive and proactive to the needs of the people. moreover, build and improve on the existing system rather than scratch & build new for better resource-efficiency, with firmer practice and enforcement on ground. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nfirst, there is a disparity between disposable incomes and new launch prices, which leads to larger numbers of unsold properties. second, we need a better and more reliable central database system that is publicly accessible to enable all stakeholders to make more prudent and informed decisions. we need to unify the affordable-home agencies under one roof. and we need to empower and encourage more urban regeneration and renewal, enabled by a new collective sale mechanism. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\nafamosa in melaka is a reminder of how we can lose our own country and how the people fought to earn back our autonomy (although it was subsequently taken over by the dutch, and only four centuries later did we regain independence). today, we need to remind ourselves that neo-colonialism is still an ongoing threat that has now manifested in non-physical ways.  datuk lai voon hon\ngroup managing director, ireka corp bhd what is your wish for malaysia baru?\nmy wish for malaysia baru is to regain our status as one of the most progressive and advanced countries in southeast asia. malaysia baru should strive to not only be advanced in terms of technology and business but also in social, political and cultural development. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\naffordable housing for all malaysians. there is a need for a comprehensive review of all delivery processes, including land and planning approvals, high charges by utilities companies for residential projects and government funds for maintenance of low-income housing. we should introduce modern planning guidelines for assisted, independent and senior living. we should promote malaysian my second home more. we should promote malaysia as a regional hub and head office for multinational corporations through incentives and trade promotions so that we can increase the take-up rate of high-end apartments, offices and hotels in city centres. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\none of my favourite historic buildings is the old kuala lumpur railway station. it used to showcase the importance of kuala lumpur as the largest railway hub in malaya. i hope the railway station can soon be restored to its former glory as a modern transport hub and hotel, much like kings cross st pancras in london.  anwar syahrin abdul ajib\nmanaging director and ceo, uem sunrise bhd what is your wish for malaysia baru?\na robust and thriving economy spells a brighter future for everyone. my hope is for the government to propel the economy by proactively encouraging and creating policies that attract foreign direct investments and promote local enterprises to prosper internally and externally. we need policies that promote long-term sustainable growth  and these policies must be equitable and inclusive. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nthere is a mismatch between new housing supply and household demand and affordability. in addition, there are multiple agencies dealing with, and providing, affordable housing. a one-stop agency would be most efficient and effective. i see the need to streamline processes to reduce compliance costs. there is also a lack of transparency and availability of up-to-date and reliable market data. an integrated database of market supply and demand indicators would help developers and financiers make more informed decisions. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\nthe kuala lumpur railway station, a mughal-influenced building, is classic in style yet intricate in detailing. this building brings back memories of my schooldays when i had to travel between kuala lumpur and kuala kangsar. it was a time of mixed emotions. it was hard to leave my family but at the same time, i was also looking forward to being with my friends. i can still remember being dropped off at the station and walking through the building to the platform to take the ekspres sinaran pagi back to kuala kangsar.  datuk soam heng choon\npresident, real estate and housing developers association malaysia what is your wish for malaysia baru?\nour wish is for malaysia baru to be a nation that has dignity and respect. we wish for fair and inclusive policies that will safeguard the unity of the people with diverse backgrounds, cultures, races and religions. no parties should be marginalised and everyone should be taken care of from both the economic and social aspects. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nfirst is the increasing cost of doing business, which is affecting house prices for the rakyat. the government should look into ways to address this issue in order to assist the rakyat in owning homes.\nsecond is homebuyers ability to secure end-financing. this is especially so for first-time purchasers. third is affordable housing, which is encumbered by various issues such as cross subsidisation, lack of comprehensive data and distribution and resale of subsidised housing. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\nthe kuala lumpur railway station. built more than a century ago, it was the main railway station connecting the north and south. today, it still serves as an important hub for commuters in kuala lumpur. it has a fascinating architecture that combined both east and west elements. the beautiful architecture is one of the main factors that it is recognised as an iconic building, attracting tourists from all over the world.  tan sri leong hoy kum\ngroup managing director, mah sing group bhd what is your wish for malaysia baru?\nmalaysia is a country that was built on unity, regardless of race, creed and culture. history has proven that as a united nation, we can achieve great things. i hope the rakyat will continue to stand together to build an even better malaysia for all the generations to come. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\naffordability should be redefined. also, there is still a big demand-supply gap in malaysia with more than 120,000 new households formed each year, compared to 88,000 new houses completed each year, from 2012 to 2017. to revive the sluggish market, we suggest the following:  chen king hoaw\nmanaging director, landserve sdn bhd what is your wish for malaysia baru?\ni wish to see a progressive government that truly cares for every single person who contributes to nation building. i wish that everyone, regardless of race and religion, will work and live together in harmony, making malaysia a great multiracial nation. what are the three most important issues facing the property industry?\nthe three issues are the property overhang, escalated and unaffordable property prices, and lack of coordination among numerous approving authorities and agencies, which continues to contribute to the overhang and mismatch between location, property type and pricing. which is your favourite historic building in malaysia, and why?\nmy favourite is the sultan abdul samad building for the richness of its design, which is similar to buildings built by the british in india during the 19th century. dataran merdeka, which lies across the road, used to be the venue for the national day parade. i would watch the parade on the television without fail when i was young and the building makes a spectacular backdrop."}, "2": {"date_posted": "28/8/2018", "title": "felda should have no problem restructuring its debts", "article": " it is now almost the norm for the federal land development authority (felda) to be chastised every other week, and its problems with cash flow and bad management exposed for all to see. hence, it did not come as a surprise when it was reported a few weeks ago that economic affairs minister datuk seri azmin ali said the government had decided to present a white paper on felda at the next parliament session to expose the true situation of felda and [draw up] strategic rehabilitation plans. the immediate focus of the new felda board and management is to rehabilitate feldas cash flow through discussions with its creditors to restructure loans amounting to rm8.02 billion, azmin was quoted as saying in the local press. most agree the agency should not have much of an issue in restructuring its debt. to recap, the agencys listing about five years ago of its unit fgv holdings bhd, in which it holds a 33.67% stake, was expected to bring it big gains. fgvs stock was floated at end-june 2012 and by the following week, on july 4, it hit a peak of rm4.66, giving it a market capitalisation of more than rm17 billion. feldas stake was then worth rm5.72 billion. today, fgvs market capitalisation is rm5.95 billion, down almost rm11 billion from its peak, which means feldas block of shares is now worth just slightly above rm2 billion  a decline of about 65%. fgv is required to pay rm250 million annually to its parent felda for 20 years as part of a land lease agreement. this is on top of a payment of 15% of operating profit from the sale of fresh fruit bunches from the land leased from felda. to date, fgv has paid as much as rm1.5 billion to its parent since its flotation in 2012, and has not missed any payment. however, with fgv facing problems such as low efficiency, mature plantations and issues with foreign workers, it has not been able to pay dividends lately. for fy2012, fgv paid a dividend at 14 sen, followed by 16 sen in 2013, 10 sen in fy2014 and four sen in fy2015, but could only manage one sen in fy2016. for fy2017, an interim dividend of five sen was paid but no final dividend was recommended. feldas 33.67% stake, or 1.23 billion shares, in fgv means that in fy2017 (stet) it received rm61.5 million in dividends, compared with rm196.8 million in fy2013. and this year also did not start off well for fgv. for its first three months of fy2018 ended march, it registered a net profit of rm1.33 million from rm3.6 billion in revenue. so, dividend payments for the current year are uncertain. the ties between fgv and felda run deep. fgvs annual report states there is a loan due to a significant shareholder, which is felda, amounting to rm1.39 billion as at end-december 2017. however, fgv also has rm222.66 million due from felda, according to its annual report. it is understood that although the rm1.39 billion debt is not yet due, fgv may settle a portion of it soon. while feldas shareholding in fgv may be its biggest shareholding, it holds various stakes in other companies as well.  small stakes in various companies feldas shareholding in several publicly traded companies is worth billions in

felda asset base is unclear, there could be some hidden gems. in february last year, former felda chairman tan sri shahrir abdul samad clarified that contrary to speculation, the agency did not lose rm4.3 billion from the rm6 billion raised from fgvs flotation. according to him, rm1.44 billion was invested in property  rm304 million in bukit katil, melaka; rm86 million grand borneo hotel in sabah; rm500 million on grand plaza serviced apartments in bayswater, london; rm225 million on the institut penilaian negara (inspen) building; and rm110 million on iris corp. some of these assets, in particular the grand plaza serviced apartments, could be worth significant sums now. felda has pockets of land all over the place, so there should be no problem restructuring rm8 billion of debt, a person familiar with the agency says. the agency was established to eradicate poverty, and to a certain extent it has been successful, but felda settlers these days are not like before. they seem to have special rights, and are even averse to carrying out replanting themselves. this is because they are seen as a vote bank and accorded special privileges. things have to change, he sums up.

corporate earnings in the three months ended june 30, 2018, but analysts are positive about seeing improvements in the remaining months of the year. the main drag for those involved in oil palm cultivation was none other than lower crude palm oil (cpo) price, an analyst with public investment bank bhd (pivb), chong hoe leong, told the edge financial daily over the telephone. if there was one key factor that affected most of their performances in the first half (1h), it would be the cpo price, which has come down quite sharply by easily 15% to 20% on a year-on-year comparison, he said. cpo price averaged rm2,700 last year, but has since fallen to around the rm2,300-and-below level. however, chong is keeping his earnings forecasts and target prices of stocks under his coverage for the remainder of the year, despite the rather bleak cpo price outlook now based on current levels. i believe earnings will be better in 2h, which is normally when seasonal production is higher, making up for the losses registered in 1h, he said, adding that oil palms seasonally contribute about 60% in 2h to full-year production. at last fridays close, the benchmark palm oil third-month contract for november delivery settled unchanged at rm2,219 per tonne. brent crude oil, meanwhile, stood at us$75.58 (rm310.63) per barrel at the time of writing. alan lim of midf amanah investment bank bhd also expects earnings to improve slightly moving forward, given recent price trends of the cpo and brent crude oil. cpo has been trading at a very marginal premium, or a slight discount, to brent, when it has always been much higher in the past few years. this suggests that the cpo price has bottomed and should not fall further, unless brent sinks significantly. as long as brent stays between us$70 and us$75 per barrel for an extended period of time, it limits the downside of cpo price to rm2,200, he said. typically, higher palm production or volume translates into poorer cpo prices. but in a case where prices are expected to be largely unchanged, the higher production may actually set the tone for better earnings for palm oil players. this is because it then makes economic sense for countries such as indonesia to increase biodiesel production to absorb the excess palm, while at the same time save some us dollars for the country by buying less petroleum, he said.  earnings outlook less cloudy for integrated, downstream players the lower prices of cpo and palm kernal would look better in the books of integrated players, who are also involved in the downstream sector, an analyst who declined to be named told the edge financial daily when contacted. integrated players can find shelter in the downstream segment due to the lower raw material prices and higher crude oil prices, which will result in improved competitiveness against synthetic products. for example, sime darby plantation bhd has been trying to beef up their downstream business segment by focusing more on differentiated products, which carry higher margins and better prices when compared with bulk products, the analyst said. chong of pivb named ta ann holdings bhd as a top performer among stocks under the research firms coverage in the plantation sector, given the companys exposure in timber. the stock, which closed seven sen or 2.57% higher at rm2.79 last friday, received an outperform call with a target price of rm3.19. according to ta anns 2017 annual report, its timber products business segment, which contributed to about 35% of the groups full-year revenue, recorded a loss of rm10.26 million, hit by a drop in production volume. we are hopeful the companys earnings will catch up substantially in 2h after it received the certification for its kapit forest management unit on june 11, 2018, which should significantly bump up its log production soon, chong wrote in last fridays note."}, "5": {"date_posted": "7/8/2018", "title": "klci seen trending sideways, immediate support at

limited gains in equities while boosting the dollar and helping keep treasury yields lower, according to reuters. sterling dropped to an 11-month low after the british trade minister warned that the nation was headed for a no-deal brexit, stoking investor fears that britain could soon leave the european union without securing a trade agreement, it said. after opening lower, all three major u.s.

47.66 points, or 0.61 percent, to 7,859.68, said reuters. alliancedbs research in its evening edition monday said despite last fridays up close, the fbm klci had on aug 6 formed an inside day bar as market participants decided not to stage an immediate follow through buying pressure. it said in the absence of stronger buying or selling interest, the benchmark index was moving between the green and red zones throughout the trading sessions before settling at 1,779.75 (down 0.34 points or 0.02%). in the broader market, losers outnumbered gainers with 514 stocks ending lower and 333 stocks finishing higher. that gave a market breadth of 0.64 indicating the bears were in better control, it said. alliancedbs research said the inside day bar indicated a pause in the game play with both buyers and sellers seen in a balanced position. it said a buying attempt with an opening level above the last fridays settlement was initiated on the opening bell, but the benchmark index did not go far up. this can be seen from the days high of 1,782.19. over the past 21 days, the market has registered a total of 18 up closes and only 3 down closes. so, the lower high on aug 6 was not a surprise since the market has not undergone a meaningful and healthy correction after the recent rise of 126 points in 18 days (measuring from the high of 1,788 on aug 1 to the low of 1,662 on july 9). moreover, many market participants were also fearful of a sudden market turnaround as the present market level is not viewed a quality trading opportunity in term of risk and reward profile, it said. the research house said following the down close on aug 6, there should be selling attempt with immediate support at 1,764. the analysis of overall market action on aug 6 revealed that buying power was weaker than selling pressure. as such, the fbm klci would likely trade below the 1,777.78 level on aug 7, said alliancedbs research. based on corporate announcements and news flow yesterday,

at 3.34pm, the stock was trading at rm5.40, still up 17 sen or 3.25% from its last closing price of rm5.23. a total of 1.51 million shares were exchanged so far, valuing it at a market capitalisation

tonnes in april, as production declined in peninsular malaysia, and sabah offset gains in sarawak. a decline in stockpile generally lends near-term support to crude palm oil (cpo) prices, as a lower inventory is a reflection of demand exceeding supply. however, monthly cpo production for the month declined 2.1% to 1.53 million tonnes, from 1.56 million tonnes in april, according to mpob. owner of online published palm oil analytics, sathia varqa, said the production fall in may was \"expected but unseasonable\", as this would be the first fall in the month of may since 1995. \"the production fall is seen as temporary but will only partly dissipate in june. we expect to see modest production rise in june, given lingering [effects] of ramadan and eid festive holidays,\" he added. as at

earnings season", "article": " while investors and analysts are obsessed with the new governments exploits, ranging from the cancellation of major infrastructure projects to reviews of road tolls, national debt and budget deficit, little attention seems to be paid to the recent corporate earnings. corporate earnings have been rather disappointing for the first quarter of 2018, with most companies missing expectations. their performance is the main factor that drives the market. the unexciting corporate results will not augur well for the local bourse, at least in the next few months, amid a lack of fresh catalysts. the numbers were down across most sectors, with only the banking sector seeing good performance in terms of profit growth. the improved earnings by the banks were due to lower provisions for non-performing loans. malayan banking bhd achieved 9.7% year-on-year growth in its net profit to rm1.87 billion in the first quarter ended march 31. revenue rose 2.1% to rm11.52 billion. maybank attributed the improvement to higher net interest income and islamic banking income. hong leong bank bhd saw a 21.2% y-o-y jump in net profit to rm690.03 million in its third financial quarter ended march 31, 2018 (3qfy2018), on higher net income, lower allowance for impairment losses on loans, advances and financing, and higher share of profit from an associated company. the banks aside, corporate earnings were generally down, says inter-pacific securities research head pong teng siew. it was disappointing and i might even say that it was bad across the board. i would estimate that only 7% to 8% of the companies listed on bursa malaysia posted bottom-line growth in the first quarter, he tells the edge. export-oriented counters such as furniture makers generally saw a decline in their net profits in the absence of foreign exchange gain as a result of a stronger ringgit against the us dollar. lii hen industries bhd saw its net profit drop 63.2% y-o-y to rm8.13 million in the first quarter ended march 31, 2018 (1qfy2018), while latitude tree holdings bhds net profit plunged 79.2% y-o-y to rm2.4 million. the stronger ringgit also had an adverse effect on plantation counter kuala lumpur kepong bhd, which saw its net profit fall 34.6% y-o-y to rm189.27 million in the second financial quarter ended march 31, 2018 (2qfy2018). meanwhile, felda global ventures bhds 1qfy2018 net profit declined 21.9% y-o-y to rm1.33 million. the drop in earnings was attributed to a lower average crude palm oil price of rm2,472 per tonne compared with rm3,061 in 2017. other notable companies that missed forecasts include axiata group bhd, which reported a net loss of rm147.41 million, versus a net profit of rm239.02 million in the previous year, due to a higher share of losses from its indian associate idea cellular ltd. cimb investment bank has downgraded the counter to a hold with a lower target price of rm5. it expects the group to post a 14% drop in earnings per share for fy2018 before rebounding in fy2019 and fy2020. other heavyweights that registered lower profits include telekom malaysia bhd and misc bhd. tm saw its net profit fall 32% y-o-y to rm157.16 million while misc posted a 54.1% drop in net profit to rm310.6 million. press metal holdings bhd, which registered a 1.6% y-o-y growth in net profit to rm150.48 million, also missed expectations due to lower-than-expected aluminium selling prices realised, higher cost of carbon anode and the stronger ringgit. it has been another disappointing quarter. many companies performed below expectations ... the market largely expected some improvement in corporate earnings in the first quarter. most sectors were down. those with exposure to foreign exchange were affected by the stronger ringgit. they include the plantation, timber and technology sectors. im expecting more negative earnings revisions than positive ones after the results season ends, areca capital ceo danny wong tells the edge. he says the market was expecting some improvement in the first quarter of the year amid steady global growth. he notes that some construction companies had several contracts in hand, which were expected to give the sector a boost. however, this was not the case. ijm corp bhd posted a net profit of rm11.19 million, down 95.3% y-o-y. the big variance was mainly due to a one-off gain of rm123.1 million in the previous year and lower contributions from its five main segments. the group also saw a lower net unrealised foreign exchange gain for the quarter. malaysian resources corp bhd, despite posting 150% y-o-y growth in its net profit to rm21.5 million in 1qfy2018, also came in below expectations, according to midf research. the earnings represent only 10.6% of the research houses estimates. aminvestment bank head of equity research joshua ng says the earnings reporting season was unremarkable with sime darby bhd being the only fbm klci component stock that has surprised on the upside on better sales by its car dealerships in china and heavy equipment business in australia. after factoring in the changes thus far, our fbm klci earnings growth forecast for 2018 has been revised to 5.4% (from 6.8%) and 2019 to 6.8% (from 7.2%), writes ng in a june 1 note. moving forward, aminvestment bank says, the removal of the goods and services tax, reintroduction of petrol subsidy and the gradual abolition of highway tolls will increase consumers propensity to spend. the research house prefers public bank bhd and bimb holdings bhd for their exposure to consumer spending, besides consumer and automotive stocks such as berjaya food bhd, power root bhd and bermaz auto bhd. it also likes exporters that benefit from strong external demand such as top glove corp bhd, vs industry bhd and inari amertron bhd as well as certain defensive oil and gas counters, such as yinson holdings bhd and dialog bhd, amid stable crude oil prices. looking towards the second quarter of the year, areca capitals wong says he expects certain sectors to be positive such as consumers, automotive, banking and healthcare, amid better consumer sentiment. the removal of gst will have a positive effect on consumer spending and it is particularly so for the automotive sector. companies that import cars such as sime darby will benefit, he says. improved consumer sentiment will translate into higher spending, which is positive for the retail sector. on the other hand, he says, the earnings of export-oriented counters that are not actively expanding will continue to be affected by the stronger ringgit.

have started their replanting programme at a faster rate. this, together with certain areas in kalimantan having not fully recovered from el nino, caused its fresh fruit bunch (ffb) production in indonesia for first half of financial year 2018 (1hfy18) to be lower by 5% year-on-year (y-o-y). maintain hold on sd plantation with an unchanged 12-month tp of rm5.35. the weighted average age of the

trees within 9,656ha of planted area are aged between 19 years and 25 years. hence, these estates have started a replanting programme at a higher rate of 4%-7% of the total planted area per annum, in order to be in line with the groups target of reducing its average palm tree age to about 10 years by fy25. for 1hfy18, sd plantations indonesia ffb yield was flat y-o-y at 8.91 megatonnes per

attributable to smaller prime matured areas due to the aggressive replanting programme as well as certain estates in kalimantan area not having fully recovered from the 2015-2016 el nino phenomenon. the selection of high-quality planting materials, stringent culling process, and adoption of best estate management practices could potentially help improve the indonesian production going forward. there is no problem getting labour in indonesia, but the rising minimum wage is a concern. as such, more mechanisation needs to be put in place at the indonesian operations. failure to do so could lead to a higher cost of production in indonesia. we make no changes to our fy18-fy20 core earnings per share (eps) estimates and 12-month tp of rm5.35, which is based on an unchanged 25 times

look", "article": " kuala lumpur: since listing on bursa malaysias main market on july 10 last year, advancecon holdings bhd has been on a roll, with four job wins in a span of nine months. the construction group, which specialises in the provision of earthworks and civil engineering services, had an outstanding order book of rm957.24 million as of march 22, which is expected to last the group until the end of next year. however, the performance of its share price has not matched the excitement from the job wins. though the price did increase slightly each time the group announced a job, it would quickly retreat subsequently. since listing, the highest price achieved was rm1.20, which was recorded on nov 1. thereafter, it had been on a seesaw, and closed at a record low of 61 sen last friday  3% lower than its initial public offering price of 63 sen  with a market capitalisation of rm245.27 million. advancecon group chief executive officer datuk phum ang kia opined that the market should be left to decide on the best valuation for the group. the movement in our share price is beyond our control as it is the market that decides, he told the edge financial daily. on our part we will work hard to deliver and secure new projects. and we believe we will give [investors] confidence in our company. on whats in store for the group, phum who has over 40 years of experience in the construction industry said advancecon intends to grow its order book to rm1 billion this year. we believe that 2018 will be a good year for us. we will continue to tender for jobs. our tender book size is about rm1.5 billion, which is a good mixture of infrastructure and property projects, he said. he added that listing on the stock market has definitely helped advancecon enhance its profile in the industry. before listing, our order book was approximately rm572 million, and now it is close to rm1 billion. we have also managed to secure new clients, such as skve holdings sdn bhd and worldwide property management sdn bhd, he said. last november, advancecon subsidiary advancecon infra sdn bhd (aisb) won a rm75.5 million contract from skve to carry out earthworks and infrastructure works on the south klang valley expressway . the following month, advancecon announced that worldwide had appointed aisb as the main contractor for earthworks for the 439-acre (177.66ha) alam perdana development in ijok, kuala selangor, for a contract sum of rm45.83 million. advancecons single-largest job win to date came in last month when it announced that aisb had bagged the contract for works on the west coast expressway (wce) stretch from the assam jawa interchange to the tanjung karang interchange. the contract awarded by west coast expressway sdn bhd  a unit of wce holdings bhd  is valued at rm370.1 million, and entails aisb undertaking earthworks, ground treatment works, drainage and box culverts, pavements and bridges. this marks the second wce job win for advancecon. in december 2016, the group was awarded a rm239.8 million contract to undertake earthworks and civil works for the banting interchange to the south klang valley expressway stretch of the highway. the group has also made inroads into east malaysia, when it clinched a rm105.23 million contract in december 2016 for the provision of earthworks of the pan borneo highway project, from the sungai awik bridge to the bintangor junction in sarawak. we are looking to expand our presence in sabah and sarawak by securing more infrastructure jobs there, said phum. the group also counts major property developers in the country as its clients, such as s p setia bhd, eco world development group bhd, sime darby property bhd and tropicana corp bhd. advancecon has reported a net profit of rm18.46 million and revenue of rm265.99 million for the financial year ended dec 31, 2017 (fy17), resulting in a net profit margin of 7%. we intend to grow our revenue by 10% to 20% per year in line with our contracts in hand, said phum. based on its closing price of 61 sen last friday, the group is valued at a historical price-earnings ratio of 13.28 times. the groups specialty in the provision of earthworks makes it a niche player in the construction industry, and unlike other players in the industry, the groups operations are not so reliant on foreign workers. foreign workers only make up 10% of our total workforce, and in fact our jobs are not so labour-intensive  we only need people to operate our machinery. we set aside about rm15 million to rm20 million per year just to buy new machinery, said phum. it is also worth noting that the specialty in earthworks gives the group an advantage when it comes to one of the biggest woes commonly cited by construction players  payment collection. this is because the nature of earthwork jobs means that advancecon would be the first to commence work for any construction project, and in that sense it would need to get paid first in order for any project to progress. [for] any development, be it townships or infrastructure projects, you need to prepare an earth platform before a building contractor can commence a job. if we are not paid, we cant complete the job and subsequent contractors cant come in to do their job. so that puts us in a unique position when it comes to payment collection, said phum. as at fy17, advancecons cash and cash equivalents, coupled with its short-term investments, stood at rm23.97 million, while its total borrowings amounted to rm108.2 million. its net gearing ratio works out to 0.48 times. the group has a dividend policy to distribute a minimum 20% of its net profit.

generally positive on the groups outlook, given its strategic land bank and ongoing transformation post demerger. investors were interested in the groups uk battersea power station joint-venture project, its transformation progress and growth strategies post demerger. currently, sime darby property is still malaysias largest property developer in terms of land bank size (20,743 acres or 8,394ha), with remaining gross development value (gdv) of rm96 billion. this excludes the additional 20,599 acres of land under option agreements with sime darby plantation and sime darby bhd. most of the groups land bank is strategically located with good connectivity  either with easy access to expressways or public transportation. sime darby property is disposing of non-strategic land outside of its key developments to enhance land value and expedite development via other developers. the group has identified land for disposal (in kedah) and will be rewarding shareholders through dividends. given its near-net cash balance sheet and potentially higher profit from land disposals, we do not rule out the possibility of a higher dividend payout in the future versus its current dividend policy of a 20% payout. sime darby property also organised a site visit to its 40%-owned battersea power station in conjunction with the roadshow to provide investors greater insight into the project. the battersea power station spans across 42 acres of land, with an estimated total gdv of u00a39 billion (rm48.8 billion) that will be launched over seven phases. the overall project looks attractive, as the land acquisition cost of u00a3400 million translates into only about 4% of the total estimated gdv (versus 10% to 20% for normal projects). phase 1 has been completed, and phase 2 will be ready by end-2020. we value the stock based on a 50% discount to our estimate of its revalued net asset value, translating into a tp of rm1.85. the large discount versus an average of 35% we attach to the other property stocks under our coverage is to reflect the slower monetisation and longer gestation period of its considerable land bank. our valuation does not include the potential value enhancement from the additional land bank of 20,602 acres under malaysia vision valley option agreements and land option agreements. potential rerating catalysts include a ramp-up in launches and new property

returns over the past 10 years can be summed up in one word  decent. with a total return to shareholders  encompassing share price gains and dividends reinvested  of 38.55% over the past 10 years, umws performance was not great compared with other pnb counters, but it was not too shabby either. of course, it is nowhere near ccm duopharma biotech bhd, one of the countrys leading pharmaceuticals manufacturers, or pnbs crown jewel malayan banking bhd, the countrys largest lender by assets. both investments have proven lucrative  giving the fund returns of more than 100% over the past 10 years. however, umws performance in terms of total returns at least has fared better than other pnb investee companies such as sime darby bhd and mnrb holdings bhd. bloomberg data shows that before its demerger exercise at the end of last year, sime darby had delivered returns of 14.36% to its shareholders over the previous 10 years while reinsurer mnrb holdings had chalked up returns of 5.24%. recall that umw had a great financial year 2012 ended dec 31, attaining rm2 billion in profit before tax mainly owing to record sales in its automotive division. but the slump in crude oil prices that started in mid-2014 coupled with the depreciation of the ringgit against the us dollar that affected its automotive sector resulted in the group slipping into the red in 2015 with a net loss of rm37.2 million. though in a loss-making position in 2015, umw paid out dividends albeit at a lower rate compared to prior years. the total dividend per share declared was 20 sen, a drastic fall from the 50 sen given out in 2012. the dividend was also lower than sime darbys 25 sen in the same year. umws dividend yield fell from 5.79% in 2012 to 2.07% in 2015. prior to slipping into the red, umw had kept its dividend payout ratio at between 57.7% and 76.1% from 2008 to 2014. the group has not declared dividends for the past two financial years, which did not sit well with shareholders chasing dividend gains. umws returns are lower than that of other automotive players such as drb-hicom bhd, which owns a 50.1% stake in national carmaker proton, and the countrys largest mercedes-benz dealer cycle & carriage bintang bhd. over the past 10 years, drb delivered returns of 156.51% while cycle & carriage made 116.57%. note, however, that it might not be fair to compare umw with drb-hicom as the latter is a more diversified group with interests in logistics, property, financial services and construction. umws returns are also lower than that of its target acquiree mbm resources bhd, which delivered total returns of 58.49% to its shareholders over the past 10 years. nevertheless, the announcement of the proposed takeover seems to have got the market excited over umws prospects. rhb research in a march 12 note upgraded the stock to a buy from a sell, with a target price of rm6.91. [mbms] daihatsu and hino distribution franchises would broaden umws commercial vehicle offerings, given their focus on small- and mid-sized trucks. we do not expect any objections from umws key principal, toyota, given that daihatsu and hino are already key companies within the toyota motor group. mbm resources autoparts business would also fit in seamlessly with umws manufacturing and engineering division. the new ownership structure could also offer more supply contract opportunities for mbm resources troubled alloy wheel manufacturing business, rhb research says. midf research in a march 14 note was equally positive about the deal. while we expect an initial share price pressure given the potential cash call to fund the acquisitions, we suggest investors buy into umw as it would be a good deal if it is successful, given umws potentially cheap entry into mbm at just eight times fy19f earnings and effective 6% to 7% dividend yield attained from perodua at the entry price, the firm says. midf maintained its buy call on umw but revised its target price to rm7.11 from rm6.70 previously.

its cash flow, hong kong-listed bgmc international ltd plans to expand its concession business by undertaking more public-private partnership (ppp) projects in malaysia and abroad, especially in the asean region. according to ceo datuk michael teh, the listing of the home-grown construction company last august has strengthened its financial capability to capture bigger ppp projects under private finance initiative (pfi) programmes. the concession business is rather capital intensive. but today, with our fundraising capabilities, we have the financial muscle to grab opportunities not only in the home market, but also regionalise our businesses and participate in larger-scale projects, he tells the edge in an interview. founded in 1996, bgmc provides a wide range of construction services and has the capability to undertake ppp projects based on the build, lease, maintain and transfer (blmt) model, which will allow it to generate long-term recurring cash flow. other areas the group is involved in are mechanical and electrical, energy transmission and distribution, building and structures, as well as earthworks and infrastructure. prominent customers include sime darby group, tenaga nasional bhd (tnb) and malaysian resources corp bhd. last august, bgmc became the first malaysian construction firm to list on the main board of the stock exchange of hong kong. teh says southeast asia is anticipated to be a big market for the group in the next couple of years because of the humongous appetite for infrastructure investments. asean has 650 million people, or roughly 9% of the global population, he points out. if we can find some projects that suit our profile, we will definitely grab the opportunity to venture overseas. he says bgmc intends to replicate its existing blmt or ppp concession model overseas. it could be anything  energy, school, hospital. we have the track record in building a campus on the blmt model. this will give us a competitive edge in convincing governments in other countries that we have the ability to deliver, he says confidently. bgmc clinched a blmt project for the universiti teknologi mara (uitm) dengkil campus, with a 23-year deal  three years for the construction and 20 years for asset management services. the concession was signed in 2012 and the campus, which can accommodate 5,000 students, was successfully delivered in the final quarter of 2015. teh says dengkil is the smallest of uitms campuses in terms of land size at only 47 acres. it is a very comprehensive and compact campus with all the necessary facilities for the benefit of students. upon expiry, we will transfer it back to the university at no cost as it [the project] would have been paid off within the concession period, he says. it is learnt that the construction cost for the campus is about rm290 million. bgmc will receive a total concession fee of more than rm58 million yearly  rm48 million as fixed or availability charges, and rm10.1 million for maintenance.  kuala muda solar plant the uitm dengkil campus is currently the only concession project the group has. but it has another in the pipeline  a 30mw solar power plant in kuala muda, kedah. last december, bgmc received a bid acceptance letter from the energy commission of malaysia to construct and develop the large-scale ac solar photovoltaic (pv) plant. according to the ecs official announcement, bgmc submitted the bid with its joint-venture partner bras venture bhd. the parties involved are in the midst of negotiations on the power purchase agreement (ppa) with the off-taker, tnb. teh points out that over the years, bgmc has been involved in energy transmission and distribution  one of its bread-and-butter businesses  building infrastructure for the power industry, including substations and underground cables. we are quite confident of delivering the project because we have the experience in the energy business. bras venture, who is our existing client, is also a power specialist, so we choose them as a partner to cut short our learning curve, he says. he estimates the kuala muda project will have a shorter gestation period of two years, but a slightly longer concession period of 21 years. at the moment, we cant reveal the estimated construction cost and concession fee but i can say that this project is smaller than uitm dengkil campus in size. bgmc is named after its founding chairman and executive director tan sri barry goh ming choon, a farmers son from a small village in sitiawan, perak, who owns a 48% stake. he is better known as the co-founder of property firm mct bhd, which recently received a mandatory general offer from philippine property conglomerate ayala land inc. goh was once the second-largest shareholder of mct with a 27.24% stake and was previously the executive deputy chairman before he was redesignated as non-executive director in november 2016. early this month, he sold his 17.24% stake in mct to ayala land for rm202.5 million, but remains a substantial shareholder with a 10% stake. while teh acknowledges that goh is a common shareholder of bgmc and mct, he stresses that for the time being, the former does not get any job from the latter. we do not ask tan sri (goh) about his personal interests in other listed companies, he says. going back to bgmc, for the financial year ended sept 30, 2017 (fy2017), the group saw its gross profit grow 23% year on year to rm128.1 million as revenue grew 34% to rm694.9 million. it is worth noting that while bgmcs net profit declined 13% y-o-y to rm54.8 million in fy2017, its pro forma net profit rose 8% y-o-y to rm70.6 million, excluding listing expenses. the concessions and maintenance segment contributed rm10.5 million to overall revenue, and imputed interest income amounted to rm43.7 million in fy2017. to recap, bgmc offered a total of 450 million shares at an offer price of 70 hk cents to raise rm143 million. year to date, the counter has declined 3% to close at 57 hk cents last thursday, giving it a market capitalisation of hk$1.03 billion.

nov 30, sime darby plantation and sime darby property were demerged from sime darby bhd through a share split exercise, where the shareholding remains the same for all the three entities during post-demerger. indeed, the demerger exercise helps lift the plantation valuation from the previous range of 18 times to 20 times to the current level of 28 times to 30 times, which is more reflective of its substantial market share in the palm oil industry. in addition, a purer play plantation stock fetches higher valuation. sime darby plantations is the worlds largest oil palm plantation company

exciting for corporate malaysia. among others, it has seen institutional players such as bumiputera fund manager permodalan nasional bhd (pnb) and retirement fund the employees provident fund (epf) pump billions of ringgit into major corporate exercises. these injections of fresh capital come even as the benchmark fbm klci is set to end the year on a high, snapping a three-year streak of declines. grabbing the headlines was pnbs massive restructuring, which began soon after its first management change in two decades last year. this year, the market saw major parts of the restructuring materialise as new chairman tan sri abdul wahid omar sought to enhance corporate focus for better returns. in the process, pnb poured nearly rm2 billion into its major oil and gas investment, umw oil & gas bhd (umwog). but elsewhere, it cashed out, injecting privately held developer i&p group bhd into majority-controlled s p setia bhd for rm3.65 billion. as an aside, the year also marked an interesting milestone when drb-hicom bhd sold a 49.9% stake in proton holdings bhd to chinas zhejiang geely group holding co for rm460.3 million. meantime, the epf supported an eyebrow-raising rm2.8 billion cash call at malaysian resources corp bhd (mrcb), the largest yet since the retirement fund brought in an entrepreneur to lead the company back in 2013.   tan sri abdul wahid omar group chairman, permodalan nasional bhd in what was his first full year at the helm of pnb, abdul wahid oversaw the breakup of not one but two of malaysias largest conglomerates with rich history. the first, announced in january, was a demerger of umwog from umw holdings bhd. the latters shares in its oil and gas arm were then transferred to its own shareholders. this made pnb the direct majority shareholder of umwog. the fund manager was to team up with ekuiti nasional bhd on the demerger but the latter dropped out after the cash requirement was assessed to be larger than expected. overall, pnb injected rm1.8 billion into umwog to improve its financial health in a persistently low oil price environment. the demerger was completed in july. abdul wahid also pulled the trigger on the long-discussed sime darby bhd breakup, which saw the conglomerate separate into three individually listed entities on nov 30. while talk of spin-off listings did the rounds for years, market conditions had previously been a hurdle, depressing potential initial public offering proceeds. abdul wahid sidestepped the issue by listing the plantation and property arms via share transfer to sime darbys existing shareholders, taking the chairmans role at sime darby property in the process. these exercises were in keeping with his vision of creating pure-play companies among pnbs major holdings to enhance value and returns. with the next phase of his pnb restructuring  involving companies in which the fund manager has non-controlling stakes  yet to begin, the coming year promises more corporate excitement from malaysias mr fix-it.  tan sri mohd bakke salleh executive deputy chairman and managing director, sime darby plantation bhd after years of planning, the breakup of sime darby finally took place this year. and mohd bakke, who used to oversee the conglomerate, has taken the hot seat in the spun-off plantation business. the breakup came 10 years after sime darby was formed in 2007, reversing a merger worth rm31 billion that was reportedly the biggest in southeast asia at the time. mohd bakke will be remembered as the ceo under whose watch the conglomerate unravelled. he took over in 2010 during turbulent times after rm2 billion of oil and gas-related losses, among others, forced out his predecessor. given its diverse business profile, sime darby struggled with cyclical downturns at some businesses, which offset upcycles at others. it was dogged by a conglomerate discount, among others, which suppressed its value and which the breakup sought to remove by creating pure-play stocks. mohd bakkes team mooted a breakup even before the management change at majority shareholder pnb but they found it difficult to catch the proverbial boat due to changing market conditions. the arrival of abdul wahid at pnb provided the final impetus needed for the spin-offs. mohd bakke has been heading sime darby plantation since its listing on nov 30, reminiscent of his previous time at felda holdings bhd, among others. at 63, this may be mohd bakkes last hurrah in corporate malaysia. in august, he told reporters that he plans to retire by 2019 after ensuring a smooth transition at sime darby plantation.  datuk shahril ridza ridzuan ceo, the employees provident fund when mrcb announced its biggest cash call in memory last may, it provoked an uproar from the minority shareholders. the one-for-one rights issue meant massive dilution for shareholders who opted out. the market did not like it either  the stock fell as much as 12% on may 18 when the cash call was announced. prior to that, it had risen 30.8% since the beginning of the year. to recap, mrcb sought to raise up to rm2.8 billion but ended up with rm1.7 billion to pare down its borrowings and reconfigure its capital structure. however, immediately noticeable was the fact that the epf, helmed by shahril, and mrcbs largest shareholder with a 33.5% stake, supported the exercise. in june, barely a month after the rights issue was announced, the epf said it was directly injecting rm1.14 billion into mrcbs bukit jalil development project. the retirement funds financial support was seen as a vote of confidence in mrcbs management, led by the businessman that the epf had brought in as head of the company via an asset injection in 2013. the move may also signal the retirement funds continued commitment to mrcbs restructuring since 2013. in turn, this may possibly be among the defining corporate turnarounds under shahrils watch as the epfs chief, given mrcbs long history. following the latest cash call and the epfs money going into the bukit jalil project, mrcbs financial health is stronger and it is set to achieve net cash position. the year ahead will offer a glimpse of whether mrcb can repay the epfs convictions with sustained earnings growth.  tan sri mohamad salim fateh din group managing director, malaysian resources corp bhd since taking up the reins of mrcb in 2013, salim has made plenty of progress in restructuring the company. but in may, he took the market by surprise with a massive cash request from shareholders despite having vastly improved the companys financial health by then. the proposed one-for-one rights issue sought as much as rm2.8 billion, the largest amount yet, and eventually raised rm1.7 billion. both the epf and salims vehicle, gapurna sdn bhd, backed the cash call. to recap, gapurna undertook an asset injection into mrcb in 2013. salim became the latters group managing director after emerging as a 16.8% shareholder. his appointment to the helm of the company marked a shift from mrcbs tradition of having professional managers run the outfit. after various exercises that included some asset disposals, debt restructuring and several private placements, the companys financial health was at its best in years. for perspective, as at december 2016, mrcbs gearing stood at 0.73 times. when salim came on board back in 2013, it was at 1.73 times. mrcb said the cash was needed to rebalance its capital structure, which had too much debt relative to its shareholders equity. the exercise would lower its gearing

28): while the property market has remained soft in 2017, valuation and property services department (jpph) director-general nordin daharom believes the market is still holding up as transactions are still taking place. the overall market activity is recording a lower rate of decline compared to the past two years. in my opinion, the property market is still holding up and transactions are still taking place, indicating that there is still demand for properties, provided the right kind of products at the right price and location are available in the market, said nordin. according to data from jpphs national property information centre, the total real estate transaction volume was 229,529 in the first nine months of 2017, down 4.33% from 239,919 recorded in the corresponding period in 2016, which in turn was down 5.72% from the previous year. in 2015, the total volume of transactions was down by 11.5% from the corresponding period in 2014. the property market is gradually adjusting to the changing economic environment, financial landscape and buyers sentiment. in a way, we are probably seeing the property market reaching a new normal, nordin told edgeprop.my. looking ahead, he believes properties in the klang valley will still be in demand, supported by economic growth and incentives for the housing sector. nordin will share this and more about the property market outlook at the upcoming 11th malaysian property summit organised by the association of valuers, property managers, estate agents and property consultants in the private sector malaysia (peps). the summit will be held on jan 23, 2018 at the sime darby convention centre in kuala lumpur. edgeprop.my is the media partner. the upcoming summit will also feature peps president and cbre|wtw managing director foo gee jen who will be focusing on the residential property segments performance and outlook in his session. like nordin, foo also believes that improvements in the overall economy and positive housing policy changes would contribute to better property market conditions. however, the residential property sector is expected to be wobbly through the year as the market is beset with fundamental demand-supply mismatches in terms of pricing and locations, said foo, citing cbre|wtw data that showed that as of 2q17, there was a residential overhang including serviced apartments and small-office home-office of 24,613 units. the overhang, he said, was contributed by a mismatch of supply of certain property segments in terms of pricing and location. the residential housing market will recover when sales improve and the balance of unsold stock is cleared, but this has not happened yet. on top of that, some fundamental structural changes are needed. until these changes are realised, we do not expect meaningful recovery any time soon, said foo. meanwhile, ppc international penang sdn bhd executive director mark saw, who will be sharing insights into the property market in the countrys northern region, said the commercial property sector in the northern region will continue to be very challenging in 2018 while the residential sector is expected to remain active. as expected, 2017 has been a challenging year and transactions have again dipped, but certain sectors have remained active, such as the affordable housing sector and selected high-end developments. hence, i foresee the property market to continue being sector-specific in 2018, he said. other experts slated to speak at the summit include knight frank malaysia sdn bhd managing director sarkunan subramaniam, savills

this year, permodalan nasional bhd (pnb) is looking at improving fundamental performance to drive returns from its major companies in 2018, according to group chairman tan sri abdul wahid omar during pnbs fourth-quarter media briefing today. with most of the restructuring exercises done or nearing completion, the spotlight will soon swivel to how the companies under pnb, the country's largest fund manager, perform post-restructuring. while the exercises were deemed to have unlocked value, which spurred market-beating returns for pnb this year, the question is whether the returns can be sustained in the coming years, after the excitement dies down. now that they have the right structure, the boards and the management can focus on their core businesses and get better allocation of capital, abdul wahid said. with the transparency of performance, we believe they can improve their fundamental performance. at the end of the day, it is about (the strategic companies) immediately growing their earnings, and with higher earnings, they can pay higher dividends (which leads to) higher share prices. so, the focus is on fundamental performance for 2018 onwards, abdul wahid added. the past year has seen conglomerate sime darby bhd carving out its plantation and property businesses to list them as separate entities  sime darby plantation and sime darby property  beginning nov 30. that follows the demerger of umw oil and gas bhd (umw-og) from conglomerate umw holdings bhd via a transfer of umws shareholding in umw-og to umws own shareholders. this was completed in july. a similar demerger is in progress in terms of chemical company of malaysia bhd and its listed subsidiary ccm duopharma biotech bhd, which is slated for completion on dec 30, according to pnb. on the property front, pnb completed the injection of its privately-held property developer i&p group bhd into listed sp setia group bhd on dec 1, for rm3.65 billion cash. this creates the third-largest malaysian developer by landbank at roughly 10,000 acres, behind uem sunrise bhd (about 13,000 acres) and sime darby property bhd (20,763 acres). separately, on july 31, pnb's wholly-owned property arm pnb development sdn bhd completed the purchase of the 40% it did not own in seriemas development sdn bhd from sime darby bhd for rm625 million. pnb development will spearhead pnbs land banking exercise, going forward, with 9,697 acres of land currently owned, pnb said. what weve done in 2017 had been to address some structural issues. for some of the companies, we felt they are better off being demerged into pure-plays. at the same time, we also believe in strengthening some of the core businesses as well, abdul wahid said on the slew of corporate exercises. market-beating returns as the corporate exercises unfolded, pnb strategic companies had outperformed the local stock market this year. for example, the collective market value of the three sime darby counters is now over rm60.53 billion, nearly 10% higher than the original conglomerates rm55.09 billion market capitalisation in december 2016. in the case of sp setia, its total shareholders' return (tsr) year-to-date is at 21.2% for the past one-year period, according to pnb chief executive officer datuk abdul rahman ahmad. he said the corresponding tsr in the past couple of years were 5.4% (2016) and 0.2% (2015). overall, the collective performance of pnbs strategic companies is twice that of the benchmark fbmklci index, abdul rahman said. at the end of trading hours today, the fbmklci stood at 1,760.24 points, up 7.22% year-to-date. in terms of total shareholders return, we delivered 18.1% compared to fbmklcis tsr of 10.3%, abdul rahman said during the briefing. in terms of value, we have increased the (total) market capitalisation of these companies by more than rm27 billion. that had contributed to stronger performance for pnb in 2017, the duos first full year at the helm. as at nov 30, pnbs net income grew 7.1% y-o-y to rm15.4 billion. it declared a total income distribution of 8.25 sen for its unitholders, or a total of rm10.7 billion. that pay-out comprises 7 sen per unit plus 0.25 sen in bonus dividend out of pnbs proprietary funds. another 1 sen will be paid as a special bonus to mark pnbs 40th anniversary next year, although this anniversary dividend will only be paid for the first 10,000 units held by every unitholder. the corporate restructuring drive was sparked by pnbs six-year strive-15 plan up to 2020, which aims to enhance corporate returns from pnbs stable of companies sustainably. the plan was rolled out by abdul wahid and abdul rahman in november 2016, after they took charge of pnb. it was pnbs first leadership change in two decades. the plan defines strategic companies, as those where pnb holds majority shareholding. the next layer is its core companies, whereby pnb has 10% or rm1 billion in shareholding value. pnb now has nine strategic companies: maybank, sp setia, the sime darby companies, umw companies, reinsurer mnrb holdings bhd and chemical company of malaysia bhd. the chemical company of malaysia demerger will create a tenth. in august, abdul wahid told the edge that pnb will move on to enhance its core companies in collaboration with other shareholders, after the strategic companies restructuring is completed. the malaysian market is the mainstay of pnbs investments, as over 98% of its asset allocation remains in malaysia. as at nov 2017, its asset under management (aum) has grown 4.6% y-o-y to rm276.5 billion. that pace puts pnb on track to hitting its 2020 target of rm350 billion in aum, abdul rahman said today. as at nov 2017, its investments are 70.8% in equities (from 69.9% a year ago); 5.6% in fixed income (nov 2016: 3.9%); 3.4% in real property (versus 3.3% in nov 2016); and 2% in private equity (2.6% in nov 2016). its cash holdings as of last month made up 17.9% of its assets, a reduction from 19.8% a year ago, as pnb sought to hold less cash and redeploy them into investments."}, "48": {"date_posted": "22/12/2017", "title": "pnb ups 2017 gdp growth forecast to 5.8%", "article": " kuala lumpur (dec 22): permodalan nasional bhd (pnb), the country's largest fund management company, is planning to increase its exposure in the global market next year as the ringgit strengthens. today, over 90% of its investments are still onshore. \"this question on our international investment portfolio was previously addressed. at the time, the ringgit was not at a favourable position for us to invest overseas,\" its chief executive officer datuk abdul rahman ahmad told a media briefing to announce pnb's performance for the financial year ending dec 31, 2017 (fy17). \"[now] the ringgit has strengthened to (a) level that we can be able to start judiciously investing overseas,\" he said. the ringgit has recovered from 4.49 against the us dollar in early 2017, supported by strong trade surplus and higher commodities prices from a year ago, as well as net foreign inflow for the year 2017. as at 2.40pm today, the ringgit was trading at 4.0845 to the us dollar. pnb is of the view that the local currency may further strengthen to 4.0 against the greenback as at end-2018. pnb chairman tan sri abdul wahid omar said the fund manager has revised malaysia's 2017 gross domestic product (gdp) growth forecast upwards to 5.8% from 5.3% previously, on expectation of continued momentum in 2018. \"malaysia's gdp growth in 2018 is expected to be between 5% and 5.5%, which will help drive the ringgit higher towards the end of 2018,\" said abdul wahid. increasing its overseas portfolio is just one of several strategies for pnb to grow its assets to rm350 billion while reducing its cash holdings to 12% by 2022, from rm276.5 billion and 17.9% respectively as at end-november 2017. reuters reported on nov 16 that pnb sought to increase its presence in private investments, fixed income and property which is inclusive of landbanking to support the agenda. with the stronger ringgit providing a foundation for overseas investments, pnb may also be motivated by returns it already received from small investments done in a \"possibly peaking\" us equities market in 2017, said abdul rahman. \"a consensus view of 9% to 10% of earnings growth among american corporations certainly looks attractive, but with record highs posted in the us equities market, we will take a conservative approach in anticipation of market corrections,\" he added. it recently disposed of its investment in the australian property market through the sale of santos place in brisbane for a$370 million or au$999 per sq ft, he said, adding that the returns will be reinvested into other international properties when the opportunity arises. in the meantime, pnb, with effective presence in a number of malaysia-listed companies, is seeking to push for organic earnings growth in the companies in 2018. this follows a slew of structural changes that has set the stage for improved evaluation and quality of performance, including the demerger of sime darby group, umw oil & gas corp bhd from parent company umw holdings bhd, as well as chemical company of malaysia bhd with ccm duopharma biotech bhd  all of which were completed this year. pnb's private highway concessionaire projek lintasan kota holdings sdn bhd (prolintas) will also undergo restructuring in 2018, which abdul rahman said it is on track for listing in 2019. abdul rahman also said pnb will remain invested in bursa malaysia as a sign of continued support to the local economic growth. he also urged other malaysian companies to further drive earnings growth to keep the local stock market attractive to foreign investors. \"consensus is forecasting a 6% to 7% growth in 2018 corporate earnings. capital follows performance, which is why we urge malaysian companies to deliver better performance and continue to attract foreign investors to the malaysian market,\" he added. the local market has seen foreign outflows in september and october, said abdul rahman  but the year has seen net inflows of some rm11 billion to-date amid the stronger ringgit, coupled with malaysia's better-than-expected gdp growth trend and expectation of a one-off interest rate hike by bank negara malaysia next year.

eight-year high of rm5.44 per share. the wave of optimism, however, fizzled out after mass rapid transit corp sdn bhds mass rapid transit line 3 (mrt3) tender process required bidders to provide financing for the public rail project. the requirement could rule out any malaysian contractor being the lead contractor, due to relative balance sheet risks. with the need to provide financing  the turnkey contractor has to come up with a financing proposal for at least 90% of the project value, which could potentially cost more than rm30 billion and a moratorium for the first eight years

return of about 0.24% ytd, long-term investors would still have seen an annualised return of about 18.2% in the past 10 years. the groups underperformance was mainly due to weaker financial results in

picks for the year in anticipation of improved demand for timber as well as the turnaround for the plantation sector at the beginning of the year. it, however, saw another disappointing year in 2017 as its share price fell by 7.3% ytd despite the stronger financial results for its first nine months of fy17 (9mfy17) ended sept 30, 2017. the companys 9mfy17 net profit edged higher by 2.3% to rm95.8 million from rm93.6 million in 9mfy16, contributed by the better crude palm oil (cpo) and fresh fruit bunch (ffb) average selling prices by 14% and 11% respectively as well as the higher sales volume of 11% and 13% for cpo and ffb respectively. affin hwang investment bhd analyst, nadia aquidah, maintains her buy call on ta ann with a tp of rm4.25 as she believes that plantation division earnings growth would be able to partially offset the drop in timber division earnings for 2018. we believe it will be a challenging environment going forward for the timber division given an increase in hill timber premium as well as reduction in the export quota, she said in her report on nov 28. bloomberg data show that there are three buy calls and six hold calls, with an average 12-month tp of rm3.90,

per barrel as of writing. recall that sapura energy was selected as one of the stock picks for the year as it could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the oil production cut between opec and non-opec members. in line with the o&g sectors recovery theme on improved sentiment following gradual recovery in oil prices, most analysts are optimistic about a turnaround story for sapura energy. bloomberg data show that the average 12-month tp for the group is at about rm1.28, indicating a potential return of 62% from its current price of 78.5 sen. following the announcement of its financial results as well as the decline in its share price, analysts have made changes to the recommendation with midf research downgrading sapura energy to hold while kenanga reduced the stock to

which was once foreign investors darling, garnered less attention since some macau-based casino operators and its sister company genting singapore plc were listed in hong kong and singapore

half of the year dragged the counter to a low of rm4.90, down 20% from the peak. for its 3qfy17, stripping out various exceptional items, genting malaysias core profit was down by 45% to rm259 million. analysts noticed that the groups costs had gone up, such as staff and finance costs, which hurt its profitability.  by kathy fong  sime darby bhd the change of guard at sime darby bhds controlling shareholder permodalan nasional bhd (pnb) threw the diversified conglomerate into the limelight. expectation of pnbs chairman tan sri abdul wahid omar restructuring sime darby to unlock asset value prompted many to take a second look at the big-cap counter. in january, sime darby announced its restructuring exercise. the conglomerate adopted a pure play strategy, breaking the group into three listed entities, namely sime darby bhd, which houses the auto, industrial, logistics and other businesses; sime darby plantation bhd and sime darby property bhd. shares in the plantation and property arms were distributed to shareholders. meanwhile, both sime darby plantation and sime darby property were listed by introduction on bursa malaysia without issuing new shares to raise fresh capital. the listing reference price for sime darby plantation was pegged at rm5.59 while sime darby propertys was rm1.50. given the renewed interest, sime darbys share price staged a rally, climbing from the rm8-level to a four-year high of rm9.62. if an investor had 1,000 sime darby shares at the start of the year, he would have gained about 8.52% as of dec 15 by holding 1,000 shares in each of sime darby listed members now. sime darby closed at rm2.12, sime darby plantation rm5.25 and sime darby property rm1.42 last friday.  by kathy fong  bumi armada bhd bumi armada bhd, which is controlled by tycoon tan sri ananda krishnan, is one of the two o&g stocks among the edge financial dailys stock picks for the year. the worlds largest floating production storage and offloading (fpso) operator fell victim to the fierce selldown in the o&g sector for two years, falling from the height of rm2.60 in 2014 to nearly 50 sen late last year. it was hammered down to oversold zone then. bumi armadas share price rebounded this year, although not strongly. it climbed above 80 sen in april; it later hovered in the tight range of between 70 sen and 80 sen in the second half of the year. the improved earnings have lent support to bumi armadas share price. the group returned to the black in its 9mfy17 ended sept 30, 2017 after it had been loss-making for two years. the group posted a net profit of rm288.4 million, a sharp contrast to a net loss of rm591.6 million in the previous corresponding period. revenue ballooned almost 44% to rm1.74 billion against rm1.211 billion a year ago. the groups better performance was mainly boosted by the four major floating production and operation projects, which have been coming online in stages. bumi armadas firm order book as of sept 30 was approximately rm22.7 billion, with additional optional extensions of up to rm13.1 billion, according to the companys latest statement on quarterly earnings.  by kathy fong"}, "51": {"date_posted": "11/12/2017", "title": "execution is key for sime darby property", "article": " at the close of trading last thursday, sime darby property bhd ended at rm1.20 per share, 20% lower than its listing reference price of rm1.50. it is a reflection of the markets wariness of the soft malaysian property market at present, says chairman tan sri abdul wahid omar, who sees a compelling investment case for malaysias biggest developer by land bank. sime darby propertys sales and earnings record have been low when benchmarked against its peers. hence, the selling pressure, he tells the edge, adding that the closing price represents a huge discount of 61% to its revalued net asset value (rnav). share price aside, the new board and management will focus on improving sime darby propertys fundamental performance, he says. to be fair, it has been only one days trading for the demerged companies that used to form the sime darby conglomerate. the spun-off plantation business, now listed as sime darby plantation bhd, ended 58 sen lower at rm5.01. sime darby bhd rose 27% to rm2.35 per share. for perspective, the case for unlocking value by demerging the conglomerate that was sime darby bhd was not premised on simply breaking up into pure-play companies. the intention was also to create value in the long term, based on greater transparency and increased focus by each individually listed companys management. in the case of sime darby property, market observers say investors may be waiting to see how well its management can execute plans and deliver value post-listing. the developer is led by managing director datuk seri amrin awaluddin, a former banker who joined sime darby in the middle of this year. prior to that, he was group managing director of media prima bhd. datuk tong poh keow, former chief financial officer of the enlarged sime darby bhd, is now executive director and chief financial officer of sime darby property. board chairman abdul wahid is also chairman of sime darbys majority shareholder permodalan nasional bhd (pnb), where he is driving a huge restructuring across pnbs major investee companies. post-listing, pnb controls almost 52% in sime darby property. the employees provident fund (epf) has 9.51% while retirement fund inc (kwap) has 5.03%. at the listing ceremony on thursday, abdul wahid remarked that for sime darby property  as with the other sime darby entities  there will be nowhere to hide and it will have to benchmark its performance against the likes of eco world [development group] and s p setia. the investment case for the developer, however, is compelling to him. i believe in the long-term prospects and potential for sime darby property on three counts, he says in a brief reply to the edge. according to abdul wahid, the first is sime darby propertys track record of about 45 years in developing major townships, which totals 23 active townships to date. that is in addition to its role as a partner in londons battersea power station development alongside s p setia and the epf. secondly, it has the largest land bank among malaysian developers at 20,763 acres, spanning from selangor to johor, he says. the land bank does not include options for another 20,000 acres in future growth areas like malaysia vision valley, iskandar malaysia and penang. the developer previously told investors that the option agreements, entered into with sime darby plantation, are valid for five years from the listing date with an option for a three-year extension. as a comparison, the next largest developer by land bank is uem sunrise bhd, which has about 13,000 acres. s p setia has 5,218 acres, excluding 4,263 acres owned by i&p group sdn bhd, which pnb is injecting into the developer. eco world development group has 8,052.7 acres, according to its website. thirdly, it also has a strong financial position with shareholders funds of rm9.6 billion and low gearing level of 12%. this means that we have the financial strength and flexibility to execute development projects moving forward, abdul wahid says. if the developer successfully leverages these factors with the right execution, there may be attractive upside for the stock, according to cimb research. in a nov 29 note ahead of the listing of the demerged conglomerate, the research house put a target price of rm1.85 per share for sime darby property. its valuation is based on a 50% discount to the developers rnav, which is larger than cimbs usual 20% to 30% discount for blue-chip developers. sime darby property has not been actively developing its land bank, which we believe has resulted in relatively lower returns for its shareholders, says cimb, remarking, however, that the developers asset value exceeds its market capitalisation despite a flattish and uninspiring near-term earnings outlook. as our valuation does not include the potential value enhancement from additional land bank of 20,602 acres under malaysia vision valley option agreements and land option agreements, we see further upside to our rnav and target price if sime darby property manages to monetise or develop these sites in the future, the research house says. moving forward, the spotlight will be on how sime darby property manages its vast land bank. for investors banking on the management to get this aspect right, the investment play in the counter may require a longer-term perspective. we are taking a three-pronged approach to take advantage of this huge land bank  own development of land within and adjacent to our existing core townships/developments and partnering parties who can add value, says abdul wahid, adding that the developer will also look at monetisation of a portion of land not within our immediate focus areas. abdul wahid reiterates his confidence that the greater focus, capital allocation and transparency of performance post-demerger will help the three demerged entities do well, thus creating more value for the shareholders. a new beginning indeed for all three entities, he says.

five-year low for the counter, which is almost 70% off its peak price. a look at bats financial performance for its nine months ended sept 30, 2017 (9mfy2017), does not paint a rosy picture. for 9mfy2017, bat reported a net profit of rm401.5 million, compared with rm432.95 million in the previous corresponding period  a year-on-year decline of 7.3%. earnings came in below consensus estimates, accounting for 67.3% of full-year forecasts, says hong leong investment bank research analyst sheikh abdullah in an oct 23 report. we cut our fy2017 to fy2019 forecasts by 5% to take into account a lower volume assumption and higher operating expenditure assumptions in anticipation of higher investments in its new brand, rothmans. despite showing signs of improvement, the market share of illicit cigarettes remains high at 56%, thus reinforcing our negative outlook for the sector, he says. while high excise duties and illicit cigarettes are the main contributors to bats decline, the possibility of the stock being excluded from the benchmark ftse bursa malaysia klci index coincides with the plunging share price. on oct 26, cimb investment bank analyst ivy ng lee fang noted that the demerger of sime darby bhd into sime darby plantation bhd and sime darby property bhd would alter the make-up of the 30-stock fbm klci. our current break-up market valuations for sime darby are: (i) rm44.7 billion for sime darby plantation; (ii) rm13 billion for sime darby property; and (iii) rm10.4 billion for sime darby (post-demerger). assuming these entities trade in line with our break-up value estimates upon listing, and applying the ground rules, sime darby plantation and sime darby property may be added into the fbm klci, and bat or ijm corp as well as sime darby could be deleted, says ng in the report. this report was followed by an oct 31 note by phillip wong of amresearch, who says: apart from the potential capital market impact on bat, we think perpetual regulatory hurdles and disruptive substitute tobacco products do not justify its lofty valuations (forward price-earnings ratio [per] of 19.8 times versus a historical average of 17.7 times). at last thursdays closing price of rm37.70, bats market capitalisation amounted to rm10.76 billion, making it the smallest stock by market capitalisation on the klci. meanwhile, bats dividends, one of the main selling points for the stock, have been declining on a per share basis since fy2016 as net profit shrinks. nevertheless, based on its present share price of rm37.70, dividend yield stands at 5.39%  still a handsome return compared with other stocks on the exchange. it should also be noted that the company has been consistent in its dividend payout ratio over the last few years, paying out more than 95% of earnings. however, the pertinent question now is whether the dividends can be maintained considering the myriad challenges the tobacco industry faces  from illegal cigarettes to high excise duties. when contacted, a bat spokesperson tells the edge that the company is committed to paying dividends above 90% of earnings. to recap, in march last year, bat announced that it was closing down its manufacturing operations in malaysia and sourcing its tobacco products for the local market from other manufacturing facilities in the region. the restructuring is in line with the groups efforts to realise a new and more sustainable business model, amid an increasingly challenging business environment, it says in its 2016 annual report. the land and building in petaling jaya was sold in november last year, with the proceeds from the sale going back to shareholders in the form of a special dividend at 46 sen per share in fy2016. as at june 30, the company has successfully transitioned to importing its tobacco products and ceased domestic production of cigarettes. the shift to fully importing its tobacco products seems to have paid off. gross margins for its third quarter ended sept 30, 2017 (3qfy2017), improved to 36.5% from 34.7% a year earlier. bat recently entered the value-for-money (vfm) segment with its new product, rothmans. the price of the cigarettes, which retail at rm12 per pack, is below its peter stuyvesant and pall mall (rm15.50 each) brands and its premium brand, dunhill (rm17 per pack). analysts are generally positive on bats move into the vfm segment as it is the fastest-growing product segment. this allows bat to compete with its peers in this segment, especially to capture customers with lower affordability and narrow the pricing difference between its products versus illicit cigarettes, says a cimb research report. although the move to the vfm segment has been touted as necessary, some analysts say it could result in the cannibalisation of its premium dunhill brand and consequently, the dilution of revenue growth and margins. we believe this will drag down its overall margins, given that vfm products have lower margins versus products in other segments. on top of that, we believe that this will also lead to the cannibalisation of market share of its higher margin product segments, says cimb research. for 3qfy2017, bats net profit fell 32.7% to rm143.18 million from a year ago, while revenue shrank 18.8% to rm757.28 million. the weakness comes on the back of lower sales volume, higher operating cost from the expenses of a new product range and an elevated level of illegal cigarettes in the market. as at august, bat reported that illegal cigarettes stood at 56.1% of the market, a slight decline from 58.9% in april. nevertheless, bats market share declined to 53.9% in 3qfy2017 from 54.5% in the second quarter. it is worth noting that bats sales volume declined 1.7% quarter on quarter, even though the broader market grew 3%, highlights aminvestment research. that said, many analysts believe that the proliferation of illegal cigarettes and the tight regulatory controls on the tobacco industry will continue to weigh down the company. there are five buy, 10 hold and four sell calls on bat, according to bloomberg data, with an average target price of rm43.42. bat is trading at a per of 15.35 times.

its net profit fell 8.7% to rm36.24 million for its first financial quarter ended sept 30, 2017, from rm39.72 million a year earlier, mainly due to higher material cost arising and higher commodity

on sime darby split ", "article": " while sime darby bhd has been enthusiastic about its planned demerger into three pure plays, investors do not seem too excited about the proposed exercise, as evidenced by the subdued movement in the conglomerates share price over the past two months. after the demerger was announced in january, sime darbys share price rose as much as 18% to touch a 3u00bd-year intra-day high of rm9.70 in june before seeing a correction to rm9 at end-august. upon the completion of the three-way split, sime darby plantation bhd will be the second largest plantation player in malaysia, accounting for 304,867ha or 5.3% of total planted area in malaysia, after felda global ventures holdings bhd. although the demerger is drawing near  in late november or early december  there has not been much activity in sime darbys shares. the counter has been hovering at the rm9 level while trading since early september has remained largely under the 200-day average volume of 8.01 million shares as investors take a wait-and-see stance on the proposed split. last thursday, the stock closed at rm9.08, giving the company a market capitalisation of rm61.75 billion. i believe sime darby plantation will continue to do well as it is not affected by the shortfall in the other operations. the reason for the lack of interest in sime darbys shares could be concerns about sime darby property and the other businesses that will be left under sime darby, says an analyst. the property side has recorded a lot of gains on disposal, which if excluded would actually make the operation loss-making. in the fourth quarter of the financial year ended june 30, 2017 (4qfy2017), the property division saw a 32% year-on-year drop in operating profit to rm801 million. the decline was attributed to lower gains from the asset monetisation of rm542 million compared with rm671 million a year earlier and lower gains from compulsory land acquisition of rm58 million versus rm145 million in the previous year. however, an improvement in the operation is possible following the appointment of permodalan nasional bhd group chairman tan sri abdul wahid omar as the chairman of sime darby property and former media prima bhd group managing director datuk seri amrin awaluddin as the property arms managing director. but it will most likely take time. to be fair, they want to demerge so management can be more focused. so perhaps it could improve after the demerger. but the question is, can they execute it? the analyst asks. public investment bank bhd (pivb) analyst chong hoe leong has a more positive view of the demerger, forecasting value creation of between rm5 billion and rm6 billion upon the completion of the exercise. this is equivalent to a 9% to 10% improvement from the current structure. pivb has an outperform call on sime darby with a target price of rm9.72. chong believes sime darby property has upside potential as it has 16,398 acres of strategically located land bank in the klang valley, negeri sembilan and johor with a total estimated gross development value of rm101 billion. moreover, he says, the property arm has access to an additional land bank of 11,806 acres through land option agreements. the potential pick-up in the local property market could also lift valuations, he adds. value will also come from sime darby plantations plan to improve its oil extraction rate and fresh fruit bunch yield. they are planning to improve the oer to 25% and ffb yield to 25 tonnes per hectare, which will create value after the merger, says chong. they are also doing some aggressive replanting to improve the age profile. the yield improvement will come gradually, though, as they only aim to achieve these targets by 2025. as for the lack of investor interest, he says, sime darby is currently trading at around rm9 to rm9.10 and we still have more than a month to go before the demerger. interest will probably rise when we get closer to the completion date of the exercise. value creation will only be realised after the demerger, after all. another analyst, however, says sime darbys ffb yield per hectare is lower than that of big-cap plantation players, such as kuala lumpur kepong bhd (klk), although the former has a higher price-earnings ratio. operationally, their ffb yield per hectare is below klks but their per is higher. after the demerger, the per will roll back to average plantation levels. there is no good reason for the premium. according to bloomberg data, sime darby was trading at a per of 33.02 times compared with klks 22.94 times and ioi corp bhds 38.42 times. when sime darby announced its plan to create three standalone businesses early this year, its chairman, tan sri mohd bakke salleh, said the plantation and property divisions were on a sound financial footing and better equipped to be listed as pure plays. he said the demerger was a crucial step to achieve the original aspirations of the shareholders in 2007, when sime darby was created from the merger of golden hope plantations bhd, kumpulan guthrie bhd and kumpulan sime darby bhd. according to analyst reports, sime darby revealed more details of the pure plays at a shareholders engagement last month. the company had said the plantation arm would focus on growing organically, aiming to improve its ffb yield to 25 tonnes per hectare (from 19 tonnes per hectare now) and oer to 25% (from 21.3% now) by fy2025. sime darby plantation will also strive to lower production costs in its upstream division by maintaining its aggressive replanting activity, improving its irrigation system and increasing mechanisation in its operations. it aims to increase the pre-tax profit contribution of its downstream division by focusing on differentiated, sustainable and traceable high-value products and building its presence in key markets. meanwhile, sime darby property will concentrate on growing its recurring income contribution to 10% of its operating profit by fy2022 by increasing its portfolio of income-generating assets, developing its existing land bank and expanding its overseas property development footprint by leveraging its involvement in battersea power station in london. sime darby will zero in on the motor and industrial businesses. upon the demerger, sime darby plantation and sime darby property will have dividend policies of paying out a minimum 50% and 20% of profits respectively. the final prospectuses and circulars are expected to be released by end-october or early november before the listing of the two units by early december.

palm oil prices may ease to trade between rm2,500 and rm2,800 per tonne for the rest of the year, say analysts. cpo came off its previous high of rm2,849 recorded on feb 17 to close at rm2,737 per tonne last thursday as traders sold on forecasts of lower prices in the coming months. leading industry analyst dr james fry said on sept 13 that the price of the edible oil is expected to decline 17% by november to december. another palm oil price forecaster, thomas mielke, while not as bearish, sees cpo trading at around rm2,600 per tonne or below in the final quarter of the year due to improved palm oil production, which will raise the inventory level. analysts are recommending that investors be selective about the plantation stocks they want to buy amid weakening cpo prices. cimb investment bank regional head of plantations ivy ng expects palm oil production to increase in the remaining months of the year, pushing up the stockpile and putting downward pressure on prices amid rising soybean oil inventory level. if production continues to increase, cpo prices may taper off. our message to investors is that we dont think the stock level of palm oil has peaked, she tells the edge over the telephone. malaysian palm oil board (mpob) data shows that the palm oil stockpile reached 1.94 million tonnes in august  the highest since february last year when the inventory level stood at 2.17 million tonnes. ng, who has assigned an add rating and a target price of rm10 to sime darby bhd, says cpo will be trading between rm2,500 and rm2,800 per tonne by end-september. in a sept 12 note to clients, she says she likes sime darby because she expects its share price to be re-rated on the back of higher commodity prices and on its plan to demerge its plantation and property divisions and list them separately. rhb research regional head of plantations hoe lee leng expects cpo prices to drop to a low of rm2,500 per tonne over the rest of the year. maybe cpo will hit rm2,500 per tonne in the fourth quarter because of the growing production and stock levels. i expect 2017 to be a bumper year as planters ramped up production after the el niu00f1o drought last year, she says. of the 11 plantation counters she covers, hoe has a buy rating on sarawak oil palms bhd (sop) and cb industrial product holding bhd (cbip) with a target price of rm4.20 and rm2.40 respectively. areca capital sdn bhd ceo danny wong also likes sop and cbip as their earnings visibility is higher than that of their peers. we prefer to look at companies whose business is simpler than that of bigger (plantation) groups as their earnings are easier to predict. it is not simple to analyse plantation counters as there are many factors to consider. cpo price is one of the important factors but this does not necessarily mean that it correlates with the earnings of palm oil producers. it depends on the timing of their acquisition of inventory as well, he says. wong also doubts that the current strength of cpo prices is sustainable in the long term as demand is weakening. according to mpob data, palm oil exports in august declined 18.5% year on year to 1.49 million tonnes but climbed 6.43% from 1.4 million tonnes in july. midf research plantation analyst alan lim, meanwhile, is relatively positive about near-term cpo prices. we note that september inventory in malaysia will rise 7% to 2.08 million tonnes. however, the price of cpo should be supported at above rm2,700 per tonne throughout the fourth quarter of this year as long as the soybean oil price remains above us$725 per tonne or about us$0.33 per pound on the chicago board of trade, he says. we think the soybean oil price should remain high due to low production in the us and south america. the ceiling for cpo is rm2,950 per tonne as we think that most producers will sell forward significantly once the price climbs towards rm3,000 per tonne. apart from lim, leading edible oils industry analyst, dorab mistry, is also bullish about cpo prices, predicting that the commodity will trade between rm2,600 and rm3,000 per tonne by january next year as long as the malaysian stockpile remains below 2.6 million tonnes. cimbs ng believes that the stockpile of soybean oil, the main substitute for palm oil, is also high. the stock level of soybean oil, as it currently stands, is quite high and the new crop in the us is also doing okay, she says. rhbs hoe concurs, saying that the soybean oil inventory is considered to be in surplus now unless a disaster or typhoon affects production. so far, the hurricanes in the us have not affected the soy fields. meanwhile, lim says he likes selected themes like high fresh fruit bunch (ffb) growth. take kuala lumpur kepong bhd. we expect its ffb growth for the financial year ending sept 30, 2017, to be at least 10%. this would be the highest among all index-linked plantation stocks, including ioi corp bhd and sime darby. lim has a buy rating on klk with a target price of rm29.25. among non-index-linked stocks, lim likes tsh resources bhd. he has a buy call on the stock with a target price of rm2.15 as he expects the groups ffb growth in the financial year ending dec

fresh fruit bunches production. however, the group expects its oleochemical division to report lower profit in fy17, due to the write-down in the value of its stocks in 3qfy17, as well as the

development sdn bhd (sdsb) to permodalan nasional bhd yesterday for rm625 million cash, despite the lack of details surrounding the transaction. sime darby told bursa malaysia yesterday that it expected to record a gain on disposal (after non-controlling interests) of approximately rm305 million. the conglomerate said its original cost of investment in sdsb is rm449 million and that proceeds from the disposal will mainly be used for general corporate purposes and working capital, including repayment of borrowings. sime darby said the disposal consideration represents a discount of 39.4% to the realisable net asset value (rnav) of sdsb of rm1.23 million as at march 31, 2017. publicinvest research said in a note today that it had no details on the specific location and balance of landbank size held after the disposal, making details of the transaction still unclear. as details of the transaction remain sketchy, it is relatively difficult to give our view on this deal, publicinvest research said. however, it maintained its outperform call on the stock, with an unchanged target price of rm9.72. rhb research institute sdn bhd however said in its note today that it considers the valuation for the transaction to be relatively inexpensive, but the value-unlocking for the deal is progressing. assuming the hotels and malls have zero value (given location and size), we estimate that sime is disposing its stake in sdsb for around rm4.48 per square foot (psf). this is in comparison to recent land transactions in selangor that were closer to rm5psf, it said. nevertheless, we would consider this disposal as a positive development. this is due to the fact that simes landbank held under associates is not even included in our rnav calculation for simes property assets of rm20.3billion. as such, any disposal of such landbank would be additional value unlocking for the company, it added. sime darby said the disposal in sdsb is expected to be completed by year end, which is also when the group expects to list its property and plantation arms. rhb however said the market should wait for more details on the upcoming listing structure of its property arm sime darby property bhd. although simes share price has already risen by more than 20% from its low, we believe the market should wait for more news on the upcoming listing structure and earnings growth drivers in the interim period, rhb said. meanwhile, cimb ib research said in a flash note yesterday that it is positive on the news and believes the transaction price is fair, as the implied discount of the implied equity value to rnav is in line with precedent transactions of malaysian property companies over the past three years, which range from 26.1% to 45.9%. the research house said simes original cost of investment in sdsb was rm449 million. we are positive on this news, as we expect sime to record a gain on disposal of rm305 million from the disposal, after netting off non-controlling interests and cost of disposal, cimb ib research said. we expect the gain to be recognised in fy16/18, and this could bump up simes net profit by 13% or earnigns per share (eps) by 4.48 sen per share. we have not incorporated this into our earnings forecasts, pending the completion of the deal, it added. at 11.34am, simes counter rose 0.43% or four sen higher at rm9.42, with

the catalyst", "article": " the 486-acre former royal malaysian air force base in sungai besi, which is just a 15-minute drive to the kuala lumpur city centre, is being redeveloped into bandar malaysia under a public-private partnership model. however, the process of selecting a master developer has not been a smooth one. the development agreement with the initial master developer  a consortium comprising iskandar waterfront holdings sdn bhd and china railway engineering corp (m) sdn bhd  has lapsed and the ministry of finance recently issued a new request for proposals to fill the role. despite the delay, bandar malaysia is seen as a game changer for the area due to its planned public transport network. it will have two mass rapid transit (mrt) line 2 stations and will be one of the stops on the kuala lumpur-singapore high-speed rail (hsr) line. a beneficiary of the mega project is chan sow lin, its low-profile neighbour located off jalan sungai besi. the area is slowly being transformed, thanks to heightened interest from developers, and has seen a rise in property transactions and new projects. transformations jalan chan sow lin cleaves the area into an east and a west side, bounded by sungai kerayong and jalan sungai besi respectively. named after one of the founding fathers of modern kuala lumpur, it has a mix of leasehold and freehold land. landmarks include percetakan nasional malaysia bhds premises, the chan sow lin light rail transit (lrt) station and southgate commercial centre. datuk ganesan, chairman of the kuala lumpur wilayah persekutuan chan sow lin landowners and businessmen association, says the area has seen much transformation over the past 20 years, with various land acquisitions for infrastructure purposes. ganesan  who is also the executive chairman and director of revolution glory property sdn bhd, which mainly deals with land-related matters  owns several parcels, with a total size of eight acres, in chan sow lin. with the lifting of the height restriction for buildings following the relocation of the airbase, he has seen approvals given for properties with more than 50 floors. this provides more flexibility in planning future developments. most of the land on the west side has been converted from industrial to commercial status, while the east mainly remains industrial land. we believe these will be converted into commercial land sooner or later, says ganesan. chan sow lin is now home to many 3s (sales, service and spare parts) and 4s (sales, service, systems and spare parts) centres for brands such as peugeot, mitsubishi, hyundai-sime darby, naza kia and proton edar. there are various ongoing and upcoming developments, including the 14-storey hybrid commercial hub the trax  jointly being developed by insan tiara sdn bhd and utusan melayu (m) bhd  and apartment project one residences kuala lumpur by akisama group as well as mixed-use development trion kuala lumpur by binastra land sdn bhd. city & country went to the rooftop of wisma mah sing  the headquarters of property developer mah sing group bhd, which is located diagonally across from southgate commercial centre  to get an aerial view of chan sow lin. from there, one can see new projects sprouting between the old industrial buildings. kgv-lambert smith hampton (m) sdn bhd director anthony chua says chan sow lin is one of the oldest industrial areas in kuala lumpur. with practically no new industrial properties being built in kuala lumpur, demand for industrial properties here has always been high. the stock stands at 5,138 units as at the first half of last year and there is no incoming supply, according to data from the national property information centre. land prices in chan sow lin have shot up, says ganesan. he adds that land there now cost more than rm500 psf, compared with rm250 to rm300 psf in 2012, about rm130 psf in 2007 and 2008, and rm50 psf in 2003 and 2004. while property consultants are envisioning a transformation for the area  from an industrial enclave into a modern neighbourhood  it will probably take some time for the change to happen as the lots are owned by different owners. the future development of chan sow lin, they believe, may be more on a piecemeal basis rather than an integrated one. pa international property consultants (kl) sdn bhd managing director jerome hong says land fronting jalan sungai besi is categorised under neighbourhood centre commercial or mixed use commercial with a plot ratio of 1:2 and 1:6 respectively, according to the kuala lumpur structure plan 2020. there are also plans by dewan bandaraya kuala lumpur to transform chan sow lin into the citys state-of-the-art automobile business park, housing companies supplying parts to businesses associated with the automobile industry, such as accessory dealers, car showrooms and vehicle-servicing workshops. the transformation of chan sow lin continues, albeit at a slower pace, amid the slowdown in the economy and prevailing slow property market condition, says hong. according to ganesan, chan sow lin has seen land acquisitions in the past for the construction of the stormwater management and road tunnel (smart tunnel), maju expressway and besraya expressway. upcoming land acquisitions there will be for the development of the mrt line 2 and duta ulu-kelang expressway phase 3 (duke 3), he says, adding that land acquisitions for duke 3 will affect the first row of properties facing jalan chan sow lin and some properties in jalan empat. part of duke 3 will run on jalan chan sow lin and jalan empat. catalysts hong believes bandar malaysia is one of the catalysts for the redevelopment of chan sow lin as the former is planned as a world-class, sustainable city within a city that offers quality living next to a vibrant international business hub  the tun razak exchange (trx)  and a tourism and lifestyle destination. the 70-acre trx is another catalyst for the area, he says. located 2km from chan sow lin, the mixed-use development will feature world-class residential, retail, leisure and cultural offerings. upcoming components include the 17-acre lifestyle quarter  a retail-led mixed-use development by australian property and infrastructure group lendlease corp (which has a 60% stake) and trx city (40%)  and the signature tower by indonesias mulia group. hong remarks that these two mega projects will bring in the most important catalyst  infrastructure. a network of infrastructure and public transport will be put in place to support the developments. there are plans to develop bandar malaysia into a transit-oriented development to provide seamless integration between the mrt, ktm komuter, express rail link and hsr lines. hsr will have its terminus at bandar malaysia while trx will boast kuala lumpurs largest mrt station. the existing chan sow lin lrt station will be integrated with the mrt line 2 in the future, and it is located only one stop away from trx. this is positive for chan sow lin as with improved connectivity, more potential house buyers and investors may be attracted to developments in the area, says hong. besides its proximity to the kuala lumpur city centre and the availability of public transport, chan sow lin is also easily accessible via various highways and roads, such as the maju expressway, besraya expressway, jalan sungai besi and jalan loke yew. furthermore, it will be linked to the upcoming duke 3. as the 35km expressway will serve areas such as wangsa maju, setiawangsa, ampang and trx, hong says it will improve future accessibility and connectivity to the chan sow lin area, providing alternative routes as well as reducing the travelling time and increasing the visibility of its surrounding areas. hurdles the two main issues that landowners at chan sow lin are facing are compulsory land acquisitions and the difficulty in extending their lease, says ganesan. the association aims to assist them in dealing with these issues. hong explains that the majority of parcels and properties in the locality have short leasehold tenure of about 60 years, and the extension of leases incurs additional development costs. also, there are additional costs to convert the existing land use from industry to building, with express conditions for residential, commercial and mixed-use developments. the plot ratio of 1:2 and 1:6 as per the kl structure plan 2020 for land fronting jalan sungai besi is also low. another setback is that the parcels are generally small, measuring about one to two acres each, hong says. it can be difficult to acquire a few adjoining lots to amalgamate for redevelopment as they are owned by different people, he points out. furthermore, due to the area being an industrial zone, potential redevelopments there have to be on a piecemeal basis. there is no master-plan layout for the entire area and thus, upcoming residential and mixed-use projects may neighbour existing industrial premises, workshops or 3s and 4s centres. the narrow roads and their poor condition are also issues worth noting. chua says the areas accessibility needs to be improved due to the potential increase in population following its redevelopment. future prospects moving forward, property experts believe the transformation of chan sow lin will continue, with various types of developments to come up. they expect the area to grow as bandar malaysia progressively takes shape. chua expects immediate projects there to be condominiums, serviced apartments and small office/home office (soho) units. flatted factories or storage facilities are also a possibility in view of the current usage of the land and its proximity to the city centre, he says. meanwhile, hong says mixed-use developments  serviced apartments, soho, commercial and retail units as well as offices  will be suitable to cater for the local population and business community. first-time homebuyers and investors may be attracted to the locality as well due to the affordable housing choices at the city fringe, supported by excellent public transport links, he adds. more developments are expected with the scheduled completion of mrt line 2 in 2021/22 and the progress at bandar malaysia and trx. new and modern developments will rejuvenate the area and raise the price point and quality of product offerings."}, "75": {"date_posted": "10/7/2017", "title": "half-year review of the edge financial dailys top 10 stock picks for 2017", "article": " the edge financial daily compiled a list of 10 stock

m strategic land in tien giang province, tan said. according to him, the first phase would see an additional output of 10 million pieces of garments per year. the second phase is targeted to be completed by the first quarter of 2019, which will increase the output of another 10 million pieces per year. the question on whether nike could maintain its earnings growth was posed at the beginning of 2017 but the sportswear giants latest financial results topped analysts expectations, helped by strong sales growth outside the us. it is also interesting to see how nikes latest collaboration with amazon and instagram will pan out as nike will soon start selling sneakers and other sporting goods through these platforms. while the latest tie-up could be a game changer and benefit magni-tech in the longer run, there has not been a lot of success by retail, luxury and beauty brands over selling to social media-addicted millennials. nonetheless, nikes decision to turn to amazon and instagram for the next phase of growth bodes well for investors as its share price jumped by 10.96% to us$59 (rm253.70) from us$53.17. as for magni-tech, despite a strong share-price performance, it is trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio (per) of about 10 times. a long-term investor of the company would have seen an annual return of about 38.34% in the last 10 years. another fund manager said that it is a tall order to maintain its earnings growth but the management has a strong track record and should be able to meet the expectations moving forward if nike could penetrate into the millennials through amazon and instagram. it is also worth noting that the fifa world cup 2018, one of the most popular sporting events, could boost earnings growth for nike, which could be beneficial to magni-tech as well.  by billy toh   bumi armada bhd\ndespite seeing a few contract cancellations, bumi armada bhd recently saw its tides turn by achieving first oil for its kraken floating production storage and offloading (fpso) unit. the offshore oil and gas (o&g) services provider has seen a 15.15% return year to date, in terms of share price. the stock closed at 76 sen on june 30 up from 66 sen at the start of 2017. choo swee kee of ta investment management continues to remain positive about the stock for the next six months in light of the establishment of a new fpso in ghana. our hope is that all the bad news is out and moving forward earnings could start to pick up, he told the edge financial daily. net profit for the first financial quarter of fy17 (1qfy17) doubled to rm48.11 million on higher fpso contribution although revenue slipped 6.17% to rm404.17 million due to lower utilisation of its offshore support vessel (osv). however, the results marked a turnaround from a poor 4qfy16, with a net loss of rm1.29 billion due to impairment charges. according to bloomberg data, 10 analysts have a buy recommendation on the stock while eight recommend holding it. cimb research resumed coverage on the company, asias largest fpso and osv operator, in early june with an add call, saying that with two terrible years now behind it, the group can look forward to improved earnings and cash flow. however, aminvest research, which has a hold call on the stock, said that the cessation of fpso operations in nigeria warranted a cautious outlook for its near-term earnings trajectory.  by samantha ho   inari amertron bhd\none main catalyst for inari amertron bhd being chosen as one of the top picks for the year was the anticipated positive impact from iphones 10th anniversary this year especially with the company having a solid relationship with broadcom, which has a three-year supply agreement with apple until 2018. the initial fear of how trumps protectionism policy would affect inari has also subsided, which is positive for the group as well. affin hwang investment bank bhds analyst, kevin low, said in his report dated june 29, that inari should see a seasonal pickup in the radio frequency division to facilitate new builds for its us customer in 2h17. he said that inari is upgrading tester capacity by 10% to 770 units. according to low, production of the iris chips has gradually ramped up to its installed capacity of five million units per month after being fully qualified in february this year and he expected the capacity to double in july with further plans of capacity expansion by the third quarter of this year, bringing installed capacity closer to the 16 million units per month level. the iris chips are expected to contribute up to 14% of inaris earnings by fy18. besides near-term growth being fuelled by rising mobile device complexity, wider global lte coverage and broader adoption of the iris biometric scanning function, inari also has a foot in the data server business and vertical cavity surface emitting laser packaging should also allow inari to ride on the next wave of laser growth. in 1h17, the groups share price gained 29.63%. affin hwang maintains its buy call for the company with a tp of rm2.60, which indicates an upside of 18.2% as of its closing price of rm2.20 last friday.  by billy toh   sime darby bhd\nsime darby bhds share price had been expected to climb on proposed corporate restructuring following the appointment of tan sri abdul wahid omar as the chairman of sime darbys controlling shareholder, permodalan nasional bhd. half a year down the road, the conglomerate has offered more clarity on the restructuring plan, announcing an in specie dividend to existing shareholders for both its property and plantation units sometime in 4q17. its share price had gained 16% as at june 30. according to bloomberg data, buy calls on the stock continue to outweigh hold calls by 11 to nine. out of 23 analysts who cover the stock, the consensus tp of 19 of them is rm9.81 per share in sime darby. however, moodys investors service has cautioned that it may downgrade the groups baa1 rating on uncertainties from the spin-offs as this would reduce diversification, scale and cash flow, thereby raising the groups business risks.  by samantha ho   genting malaysia bhd\nalthough genting malaysia bhd ended 1h17 as the second-best performer on the fbm klci with a 20.09% increase in share price, the party may not be over for the gaming counter just yet as more gaming and non-gaming revenue is expected to roll in throughout its upcoming quarters on full operations at its sky plaza. maybank ib researchs samuel yin shao yang lifted earnings estimates by 3% to 6% for the next three years on higher priced meals at sky avenue, a higher average price per ticket at 20th century fox world and a maiden 20th century fox world sponsorship income of some rm50 million effective mid-2017. the research house upgraded its call from hold to buy and the counters tp by 14% to rm6.15 from rm5.40, with earnings expected to grow in 3qfy17 supported by the opening of vip rooms and 250 suites at the sky plaza, genting highlands premium outlet and the theme park hotel. we also understand that most sky avenue tenants will begin paying rent in 3qfy17 after their rent-free period expires, yin noted. the 12-month consensus tp from 20 analysts is rm6.15, with seven having a buy call and 11 analysts having a hold call, while two are telling clients to sell the stock.  by samantha ho   ta ann holdings bhd\nexpected to see a turnaround in 2017, ta ann holdings bhd was the worst performer in 1h17 among the 10 stock picks as its share price fell by 10.4%. instead of bottom fishing, the experience of holding ta ann shares for investors would probably feel more like catching a falling knife instead. nonetheless, analysts remain positive about the company, with bloomberg compilation showing a 12-month tp of rm3.93, indicating an upside of 11.3%. however, of nine analysts, only two of them have a buy call with the rest recommending to hold. midf research recommended a buy call with a tp of rm4.30, which represents 21.8% upside to ta anns 1qfy17 core net income of rm42.2 million, which was above expectations. alan lim, the analyst from midf research, said that the strong result was caused by stellar performance of the plantation division as 1qfy17 fresh fruit bunch (ffb) production growth came in stronger than expected at 20% year-on-year to 148,715 tonnes. while the kl plantation index gained 3.9%, ta ann saw its share price fall by 10.4%. recall that the group also saw a lacklustre year in 2016 when its share price fell by 5.58%. lim said the recommendation being upgraded to buy was due to an expectation of plantation divisions earnings growth to remain strong on high ffb volume seen at 10%, the timber division to remain profitable due to support from high export log prices and it is a key laggard among plantation stocks.  by billy toh   protasco bhd\npicked as one of the construction players that were expected to benefit from the governments spending on infrastructure building, protasco bhd had not been up to the expectations, at least in terms of share price. the stock dropped nearly 8% in 1h17. nonetheless, the company saw its joint venture with kumpulan perangsang selangor bhd awarded a rm174.4 million contract for the proposed infrastructure works at pulau indah industrial park, which are for 18 months and scheduled for completion in january 2019. jeremy goh, an analyst with hong leong investment bank (ib), shared that protasco has a letter of intent for phase three of the 1malaysia housing project for civil servants in putrajaya. other than a potential election play, protasco also has a strong defensive nature for a construction player with its dividend yield of about 5.7%. hong leong ib has a tp of rm1.20 for protasco, indicating an upside of 14.3% based on its close last thursday.  by billy toh   sapura energy bhd\no&g services provider sapura energy bhd, previously sapurakencana petroleum bhd, saw its share price take a beating after reporting a 75% slump in its net profit for 1qfy18. a low oil price environment and worsening rig utilisation also did not help. its share price had seen a drop in profitability amid higher taxation. its revenue took a hit in 1qfy18, falling 9% on lower contributions from the drilling and exploration segment and the production segment. the results sent its share price down to rm1.57  the lowest level since early december last year. it closed at rm1.65 last friday, trading at a forward per of slightly more than 40%, according to bloomberg. bloomberg data indicates that a higher number of analysts  now seven  has a buy call on the stock compared with the five that recommended adding it at the beginning of the year. however, six analysts downgraded the stock within the past two months, lowering the consensus tp to rm3.19.  by samantha ho   classic scenic bhd\nwhile classic scenic bhd underperformed against the fbm klci, the company has proven to be a resilient counter that is suitable for a defensive strategy with a high dividend yield of about 6.04%. the wooden picture frame makers share price increased by 1.68% in 1h17. its latest quarterly financial results showed a 12.2% decline in net profit to rm3.7 million for 1qfy17 from rm4.2 million in the corresponding quarter a year ago, mainly attributed to a varying product mix and higher cost of labour and operating expenses as a result of lower fair value gain from foreign currency forward contracts. the company is primarily involved in the manufacturing and export of high-end wooden picture framework mouldings and about 90% of its sales come from the export market, mainly to the us and are denominated in us dollars. classic scenic continues to remain one of the best defensive counters given the strong balance sheet, with its net cash standing at rm26.4 million or 21.9 sen per share at end-march, an increase from rm23.9 million in 2016. the group also has a good track record of generous dividend payout. in 2016, classic scenic paid a total of 11 sen per share for dividends, up from 10 sen per share a year ago. insiderasia, which remains positive about the company, estimated a total dividend of 13 sen to 14 sen per share for 2017, giving an above-market average yield of above 7%. by billy toh   gamuda bhd\ngamuda bhd, whose shares soared 14.29% year-to-date to close at an eight-year high of rm5.50 per share, still appears to be riding on a wave of optimism towards the construction sector ahead of the upcoming elections. widely held as a proxy for the sector and beneficiary of expected infrastructure jobs to be awarded, the counter still commands a buy call by 18 out of 23 analysts covered by bloomberg data. the consensus tp is rm5.93 per share by 20 out of 23 analysts. cimb research kept the counter as its top pick as a beneficiary of the rail theme, with hong leong investment bank agreeing that gamuda would ride on upcoming mega rail projects such as the kuala lumpur-singapore high-speed rail, light rail transit line 3 and east coast rail link. meanwhile, affinhwang capital research had cut its earnings forecast by 5% to 6% to reflect lower property earnings and higher tax rates. however, it raised its tp for the stock to rm5.94 per share and highlighted that the group targeted a higher new contract target of rm10 billion from rm3 billion to rm4 billion this year. property sales recovered for gamuda in 3qfy17 at rm620 million compared with rm575 million in the year before. net profit had been on a climb over the past three quarters to rm170.93 million in 3qfy17. the group also announced that it would be paying a second interim dividend of six sen per share on july 28. by samantha ho\n"}, "76": {"date_posted":

pure plays  sime darby plantation bhd, sime darby property bhd and sime darby bhd  is made. there will be familiar faces, and maybe one or two new ones as there are six important positions to be filled [for three pure plays], three ceo positions and three chief financial officer (cfo) positions. this is being worked on at the moment, but i dont think you will be taken by surprise by the line-up, he told a media briefing yesterday in conjunction with the release of the groups results for the third financial quarter ended march 31, 2017 (3qfy17). announcing the leadership of the pure play entities is one of the items on the groups checklist towards the listing of the entities by the end of the year. also on that checklist is the restructuring of the groups remaining borrowings, prospectus submissions, obtaining approval from the relevant authorities, external engagements and the convening of an extraordinary general meeting to obtain its shareholders approval. the group completed the restructuring of its us$800 million (rm3.42 billion) sukuk last tuesday, which was a major milestone in the groups debt reorganisation to create the three pure plays. the sukuk comprises two series: us$400 million that matures in 2018 (series 18) and the remainder us$400 million that will mature in 2023 (series 23). sime darby group cfo datuk tong poh keow said about 21.5% of the sukuk holders had agreed to novate their bonds to sime darby plantation. we gave them (the sukuk holders) the option to either tender out or to novate depending on their preference, so the remaining [78.5%] opted to cash out. but you have to remember that about us$400 million of this sukuk actually [matures] in 2018, and that is largely where we saw the tender coming out, from this group, she said. the group paid us$353.8 million to its series 18 sukuk holders and us$277.5 million to its series 23 sukuk holders. the restructuring of the rest of the groups borrowings is currently ongoing. as for its financials, sime darby reported a 5% year-on-year (y-o-y) net profit rise in its 3qfy17 to rm699 million from rm663 million, on improved contributions from its plantation, industrial and motor divisions. revenue grew 22% y-o-y to rm12.44 billion from rm10.23 billion. for the cumulative nine months ended march 31, 2017, the group reported a 40% y-o-y jump in net profit to rm1.79 billion from rm1.27 billion, while revenue grew 8% to rm34.88 billion from rm32.23 billion. bakke highlighted that the group had so far achieved 81% of its target net profit for the financial year ending june 30, 2017 (fy17) of rm2.2 billion. we are working very hard to achieve our [target profit], but there are challenges we need to grapple with. for example, in indonesia, the port authorities have announced a 10-day holiday in conjunction with hari raya festivities  that will be a challenge as it is a critical period for us to move our products, said bakke. the performance of the groups plantation division in the quarter was enhanced by average crude palm oil (cpo) selling price realised, which was 40% higher at rm3,088 per tonne in 3qfy17 compared with rm2,200 in 3qfy16. we think cpo prices will stay above rm2,500 per tonne, at least for the next six months, said bakke. sime darbys plantation division managing director datuk franki anthony dass also shared that the group

institutional and retail investors exposure as a percentage to total value of malaysian shares traded fell to 19% last month from 20.75% in march 2017. data from bursa malaysia released last week showed that foreign trading volume also declined 25% to 3.9 billion shares last month from 5.2 billion shares in march 2017. nevertheless, foreign purchases of malaysian stocks were still above the levels recorded in january and february this year of rm9 billion and rm7.8 billion respectively. foreign trading activity for malaysian stocks has also been rising from three billion shares and 3.4 billion shares in january and february 2017 respectively. according to market analysts, foreign institutional and retail investors flow will continue to remain robust in the near term as malaysian market performance still lags behind its regional peers. investors globally are on a risk-on position where their risk appetite is relatively higher, with a focus on emerging underperformed markets like malaysia which has lagged behind its peers in the past three years, areca capital sdn bhd chief executive officer danny wong teck meng told the edge financial daily. year to date, the benchmark fbm klci has risen 7.8% to close at 1,762.74 points last friday. this compares with thailand set indexs gain of 0.35%, 7.7% increase by jakarta stock exchange composite index, and 11.41% rise by singapores straits times index. wong sees the malaysian market playing catch up in a bottom-up economy, adding that a small stock market correction is likely this month. it is too early to judge whether there is a bubble in the making. i guess the bubble would have some more room to grow, just waiting for a potential small correction in may, he said, referring to the local stock markets strong run. philip capital management sdn bhd chief investment officer ang kok heng said he would not be surprised if a small market correction happens, noting the well-known trading adage sell in may

yes, we expect there is some more room for more foreign buying of malaysian equities. the entire mood has changed [for foreign investors] since the us dollar stopped strengthening against major currencies like last year, he added. inter-pacific research sdn bhd head of research pong teng siew concurred, saying that the higher money supply and credit flow in malaysia implied more business activities in the pipeline. according to bank negara malaysias data, march broad money supply, m3, grew 4.5% to rm1.67 trillion, from rm1.60 trillion in the same month last year, while total loan in the banking system grew 5.96% to rm1.54 trillion, from rm1.45 trillion in march 2016. there are reasons to be optimistic in malaysia ... the money supply implies great deal of liquidity in the market. there is also better credit flowing, but it is also because foreign investment banks are positioning themselves for a piece of advisory business opportunity here, pong said. he noted that one of the notable corporate exercises that most investment bankers are eyeing is the proposed demerger of sime darby bhds businesses. in february this year, the diversified group proposed to float its property and plantation divisions separately on bursa through distribution of shares to its shareholders. with the completion of the exercise, there will be three separate and independent listed entities with distinct businesses, with sime darby plantation and sime darby property to undertake the current plantation and property businesses of sime darby. sime darby itself would remain listed with the

"promoting malaysian stocks to japanese investors", "article": " when conglomerate sime u00addarby bhd, rubber glove u00admanufacturer top glove corp bhd and u00adcondom maker karex bhd were featured at an investment seminar organised by bursa malaysia in japan last year, one japanese was particularly impressed with the size and quality of these listed firms. yoshitaka harada, managing director of musashi securities co ltd, admits that before he attended the seminar, he did not know that karex is the largest condom manufacturer in the world, while top glove is the worlds biggest rubber gloves producer. last july, bursa malaysia brought sime darby, karex and top glove for an investor relations (ir) presentation to japanese retail investors. it is pretty rare for malaysian companies to do ir in japan, he tells the edge. musashi securities is a mid-cap securities firm in saitama city, near tokyo. according to harada, malaysian listed companies have not gone to the japanese market in a big way, but the pioneer three companies promoted by bursa have piqued the interest of investors there. after that seminar, our retail investors came to us and said they want to buy into these malaysian companies. but the problem is, we didnt have any broker in malaysia, he says. musashi securities then reached out to a few local brokerage firms for potential partnership, before deciding that mercury securities sdn bhd is a good fit. mercury securities, being our local partner, will provide us a lot of information and research material about malaysian companies. with that, we hope to promote more malaysian stocks to our japanese retail investors, harada says. last month, musashi securities, japanese securities journal research and mercury securities organised an investment seminar in kuala lumpur. four japanese listed companies  s-pool inc, avant corp, intelligence wave inc and yumeshin holdings co ltd  with a market capitalisation of u00a54.2 billion (rm170 million), u00a59.1 billion, u00adu00a513.9 billion and u00a560.6 billion respectively, were featured at the seminar, which saw the attendance of prominent fund managers, including phua lee kerk of phillip mutuals and choo swee kee of ta investment management. yumeshin and s-pool are manpower service providers, while avant and intelligence wave are application software companies. musashi securities launched a u00adshariah-related fund three years ago, the first of its kind in japan. with assets under management of about us$30 million (rm132 million), harada says most of it has been invested in malaysia, because this is the market where it can find the most shariah-compliant stocks. i came to malaysia for the first time about 10 years ago. but in the last couple of years, i came here very often. i think the malaysian economy has been growing steadily, unlike china, whose growth is the envy of many countries, but is facing challenges to sustain its remarkable growth story, he says. he believes that as the asean economy grows, supported by an increase in population and the middle class, the malaysian stock u00admarket will draw foreign investors attention as a good number of shariah-compliant companies are listed here. there are two things we like about the malaysian stock market. the growth potential of the hybrid islamic economy and chinese economy as well as the strong leadership of asean countries. your economy is a mixture of chinese and islamic economies. it is diversified, which is very attractive to japanese investors like us, he says. harada points out that the weakness of the ringgit is good for export-oriented companies, and he believes most of them are making good profits now. over the years, we like the growth story of malaysia and we still believe in that story, he says. moving forward, harada says, musashi u00adsecurities will focus on promoting u00adcompanies with growth potential in the near term, u00adreasonable dividend yield and excellent governance records. japanese investors focus not only on the price-earnings ratio but also the potential to grow. we will recommend high growth stocks, he says. he adds that although japanese retail u00adinvestors have already invested in malaysian stocks via mutual funds, they do not actually have an opportunity to directly invest in the individual companies because there is a lack of information. therefore, musashi securities now aims to educate japanese investors, be it high-net-worth individuals or retail investors, via seminars or face-to-face sales promotion with the help of mercury securities. harada believes that in the near future, japanese companies will accelerate their investments and mergers and acquisitions u00adactivities in malaysia, and musashi u00adsecurities hopes to participate as an active business u00adpartner. for japanese multinational u00adcompanies planning plan to expand their business in u00admalaysia, we will provide them with opportunities such as m&a and business partners. yoshitaka says some japanese firms have been trying to expand their businesses into this region, but they have to invest in certain local companies to achieve it. for instance, tokyo-based nippon u00adyusen u00adkabushiki kaisha (nyk line), one of the u00adoldest and largest shipping companies in the world, controls 65% of malaysian logistics firm u00adtasco bhd. we believe such inbound investment u00adactivities by japanese companies will keep on going in the coming years, he says. malaysian companies are also looking for business partners in japan, and musashi u00adsecurities wants to play a significant role in identifying and eventually matching the u00adparties, with each achieving its respective investment objectives. japanese companies are very

eligible holders of two tranches of its outstanding sukuk amounting to us$800 million (rm3.53 billion) to either tender for cash repurchase or novate the debt to sime darby plantation sdn bhd. in a filing with the stock exchange, sime darby said the cash repurchase involves a multi-currency us$1.5 billion sukuk programme issued by sime darby global bhd on jan 29, 2013, of which the outstanding sukuk is in two tranches of us$400 million each. one tranche expires in 2018 and the other in 2023. under the cash repurchase option, sime darby said it will pay 98% of the face amount of the 2018 due sukuk, and 97% of the sukuk due in 2023. the cash repurchase tender offer began yesterday and will close by may 11 this year. under the second option, sime darby is seeking consent for sime darby plantation to be the new obligor in place of sime darby in its capacities as obligor, seller and lessee. it is also seeking consent to amend certain consequential changes to the terms and conditions of the programme, including waiving the occurrence of a dissolution event as a result of the reorganisation. sime darby said the tender offers are made in connection with the proposed reorganisation of its businesses, which the group announced on feb 27. the reorganisation will see a restructuring of the group, which will result in the creation of three independent pure play companies to be listed on bursa malaysia, namely sime darby plantation, sime darby property and sime darby. meanwhile, fitch ratings said yesterday it expected to assign sime darby plantation a long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating of bbb+(exp) with stable outlook, and an expected senior unsecured rating of bbb+(exp). we have assumed that sime darby plantation, which had about rm8.3 billion of inter-company loans from sime darby and other group companies as at june 2016, will receive us$600 million of debt (including outstanding issuance under a us$1.5 billion sukuk programme) and rm2.2 billion of perpetual subordinated sukuk (issued under a rm3 billion programme) from sime darby, it said. sime darby plantations scale and diversification reduce risks from weather-related events in specific regions and changes in regulatory regimes, and give the company better funding access. its downstream manufacturing footprint also gives the company easier access to key palm product markets in asia and europe, it said. fitch said it estimated that the total debt to be transferred to sime darby plantation would total to rm4.9 billion by june 2017, after the transfer is completed. yesterday, moodys investors service also assigned a first-time baa1 issuer rating to sime darby plantation, adding that the rating outlook was stable and reflected its expectation that sime darby plantations management would maintain a prudent and conservative approach towards any further investments. sime darby plantations baa1 issuer rating reflects its market leadership position, firstly, as the largest listed oil palm plantation company by planted area and crude palm oil production, and secondly, as the leading producer globally of certified sustainable palm oil, said moodys vice-president and senior analyst jacintha poh. poh added, however, that the rating was constrained by sime darby plantations exposure to volatile crude palm oil prices."}, "83": {"date_posted":

"}, "84": {"date_posted": "10/4/2017", "title": "lead story: some indicators looking up, but this has given false hope in the past", "article": "  as the curtain falls on the first quarter (1q2017), it is clear that the local stock market is having a party. the benchmark fbm klci is up 5.99%, its fastest quarterly expansion since 2013 and its best start to a year since 2007. the return of foreign investors, who were net sellers over the past two years due to a weakened ringgit, is one of the factors that is fuelling the rally. year to date till march 24, foreign investors have poured a net rm1.378 billion into local stocks, according to data tracked by midf research. the past two years had seen a net outflow of rm19.5 billion in 2015 and rm3 billion last year. however, the fbm klci is still lagging behind other emerging markets, slightly underperforming the msci developed markets index, which rose 6.21% in 1q2017. in comparison, the msci emerging markets index has expanded twice as fast at 12.43% over the same period. this lag is consistent with the trend over the past 12 months, says alliancedbs research head of research bernard ching. while improving fundamentals and sustained bullish sentiment will keep the malaysian market buoyant in the near term, he says the upside to fundamental valuations has narrowed, though not yet stretched. asset prices are likely to overshoot fundamental values in a liquidity driven rally, ching says. as such, investors should look for profit-taking opportunities as and when they arise. the emerging question is whether the strong first quarter is signalling a strong year ahead for the fbm klci. it began the past two years in green, albeit more moderate, territory but finished in the red, down 3% last year and falling 3.9% in 2015. thus far, bursa malaysia has closed three consecutive years in retreat, although it is still, according to bloomberg, technically, the worlds longest bull market at eight years and counting since the last correction over 20% in 2008. some indicators, such as the ringgit, are looking up, but have proved to be false hope before. the ringgit has regained some lost ground against the greenback over the past three months, up 1.35% to 4.4255 as at march 31. however, it is still down 12% over the past year compared with 3.8905 on april 1 last year. in us dollar terms, the fbm klci has gained 8.1% ytd, outperforming some regional peers such as the jakarta composite index (+6.8%) and the nikkei (+4.8%), though lagging behind the straits times index (+14.2%) and the hang seng index (+10.2%). banks and government-linked companies have driven the fbm klcis rise this quarter, making up 7 of the top 10 gainers among its 30 constituents. corporate announcements and news flow are a significant sentiment driver this quarter. a notable example is sime darby bhds 14.57% rise up to march 31 as excitement builds over its much-anticipated demerger plan that will see the plantation and property units separately listed on bursa. the demerger plan was announced in february, six months after tan sri abdul wahid omar took the helm at permodalan nasional bhd, the bumiputera equity firm that controls the majority of sime darby shares. with a reputation in corporate malaysia as a mr fixit, wahids mandate is to improve the corporate performance of pnbs stable of companies. when he took over, the cumulative performance of pnb companies underperformed the fbm klci. the impact on investor sentiment was almost immediate  the collective showing of pnb companies overtook the benchmark in october and has outperformed the fbm klci year to date. elsewhere across the market this quarter, the shift in sentiment and investing appetite is also clearly visible as investors opt for commodity and cyclical stocks over more defensive counters. while the inflection point came around october last year, the shift has been more pronounced so far this year. ytd, commodity counters are collectively up 10.5% while cyclicals are up 10.8%. in comparison, defensive counters are up by a total of 1.7%. among the commodity counters that have done well are press metal bhd which chalked up a ytd return of 66.1%, felda global ventures holdings bhd (34.2%) and batu kawan bhd (23.1%). the outperformers among the cyclicals were airasia bhd (62.6%), ekovest bhd (48.1%) and malaysia building society bhd (44.4%). the defensive stocks that outperformed included my e.g. services bhd (25.2%), time dotcom bhd (11.9%) and axiata bhd (9.1%). ching of alliancedbs research expects this trend to continue as cyclical stocks tend to outperform defensive stocks in a liquidity-driven rally. earnings prospects for malaysian equities have improved after the earnings downgrade cycle ended in 3q2016. with a nascent earnings recovery and more stable commodity prices, cyclical stocks will outperform defensive stocks in 2017, ching says. outside of the 30 top stocks making up the benchmark index, small and mid-cap companies are also taking off and outperformed the fbm klci. the fbm70 index has risen 12% since the year began, while the fbm small cap index grew 15.5%. much of the bullishness has been seen in the technology counters, which is the best performing sector ytd with a 38.2% gain. construction and property counters are also rallying by just over 15% each. driving the tech sectors rally is excitement over apple incs upcoming iphone 8, with most expecting strong sales. players within the apple supply chain such as globetronics technology bhd and inari amertron bhd were among the first counters to surge. while ching sees further upside for tech stocks, he says valuations are now quite fair after the ytd run-up and thinks a rerating will only happen once the iphone 8 begins selling around the third quarter of the year. meanwhile, the property rally is driven by investors seeing the sector as a good proxy to the larger market, says kenanga research head of equity research sarah lim. however, the rally is detached from physical market fundamentals and is more driven by news flow. lim believes valuations have bottomed out and developers are unlikely to see substantial earnings misses this year. more likely, we will see most developers on target or slightly beating estimates for the full year in terms of sales. notably, the oil and gas sector rose 8.2% this quarter as global brent crude oil prices remained steady around us$55 per barrel for most of the quarter, thanks to the six-month, organization of petroleum exporting countries-led output cut which began in january. however, the outlook for oil and gas stocks remains uncertain, says ching, and will largely depend on company-specific news flow and further movement in oil prices. while kitchen sinking and impairment charges are largely done, earnings recovery is still at a nascent stage and uneven, given the low utilisation rate (for vessel owners) and slow order book replenishment (for fabricators), says ching. as at march 30, brent crude was trading at us$52.96 a barrel, down 7.8% from its ytd high of us$57.10 on jan 6.

larger slice of the pie in the asean markets, as the automotive firm targets to export the locally assembled cx-5 to cambodia, indonesia and myanmar in the second half of this year. mazda japan is very bullish on asean, and they want to support us (mazda malaysia) to make malaysia an exporting hub, said bermaz auto executive director datuk francis lee kok chuan when met in singapore late last month. mazda malaysia, the local assembler of mazda vehicles in malaysia, is a 30:70 joint venture between bermaz auto and japanese car giant mazda motor corp (mazda japan). and next year, mazda malaysia hopes to export to one of the countries in the middle east. we are working with the malaysian government and are hoping to form some ftas (free trade agreements) at the g2g (government-to-government) level. otherwise, it will not be feasible with all the duties involved, he said. currently, lee said 50% of mazda malaysias sales come from the export market. he expects the portion to expand in future. more recently, back in kuala lumpur, he told the edge financial daily that mazda malaysia had invested over us$20 million in a new paint shop at inokom corp sdn bhds plant in kulim, kedah, last year, so that they can produce the latest mazda vehicle colours, and more importantly, to cater for the asean export markets. however, he declined to reveal any export target numbers. besides mazda vehicles, bermaz auto also distributes the brands spare parts in malaysia and the philippines. the group has a 29% stake in inokom, the contract manufacturer of various marques, including mazda vehicles. other shareholders of the consortium are sime darby motors sdn bhd (51%), hyundai motor co of south korea (15%) and sime darby hyundai sdn bhd (5%). lee said after the new paint shop is installed, production capacity at the inokom plant will be increased from 18,000 units to 35,000 units over two shifts. this, he said, should augur well for both mazda malaysia and inokom corp, which ultimately also benefits bermaz auto. with this increase in volume, mazda malaysia will try to export as many mazda vehicles as possible, by making malaysia the asean exporting hub, said lee. he also said the export sales figures will not be reflected in bermaz autos total vehicle sales, as mazda malaysia will be the one that exports mazda vehicles to other asean markets through its own distributors in their respective countries. the exports have nothing [directly] to do with us (bermaz auto). mazda malaysia will export [the cars] to their own national sales office in thailand, as well as their distributors in indonesia, cambodia and myanmar. these are the major export markets that they are looking at, lee clarified. of course, there will be earnings contributions to bermaz auto, because we also own [a] 30% stake in mazda malaysia, he said. vietnam is not included in mazda malaysias export plan as mazda japan operates a manufacturing plant there, said lee. the japanese automaker also owns a plant in thailand. bermaz autos car sales are mainly driven by the mazda 2 completely built-up (cbu) model imported from thailand, as well as the mazda 3 and cx-5, which are completely knocked-down (ckd) models assembled at inokoms plant in kulim. currently, the group has over 10 cbu models in its portfolio, but only two ckd models  namely mazda 3 and cx-5. bermaz auto changed its name from berjaya auto after a management buyout last year, as it is no longer a major subsidiary of berjaya corp bhd. bermaz auto has been recording lower car sales of late, in line with declining industry-wide volumes since the beginning of last year. the company, however, is unfazed by the situation. on the sidelines of maybank investment banks invest asean 2017 forum in singapore, lee said the groups strategy is to promote higher margin products, such as vehicles with typically higher selling prices. we dont want to push [lower-value cars], because the more [of those] cars we push, the more money we lose. so we only push those from which we can make money, he said. for the two months ended feb 28 this year, sales of mazda brand vehicles in malaysia fell 41% to 1,264 units from 2,136 units a year ago. over the entire 2016, mazda brand vehicles sales shrank 13% to 12,493 units from 14,325 units in 2015. bermaz auto recorded a 39% fall in net profit in its third quarter ended jan 31, 2017 to rm25.11 million from rm41.13 million in the same quarter a year ago. the earnings figure was the lowest bermaz auto charted since the companys public listing back in 2013. revenue was down 35% at rm338.68 million, versus rm522.58 million previously. despite the weaker financial performance, lee thinks bermaz auto is still outperforming some industry peers. we are still reporting profit, unlike other players. most of them are losing money because of the high depreciation of the ringgit, he said. lee also believes that bermaz autos prospects will improve in fy18, driven mainly by the introduction of mazdas new cx-5 and cx-9 models in malaysia by june this year. the supply of these models is already short globally, he noted. these are high margin products, especially the cx-9. mazda japan has given us some units to sell in malaysia, he said, adding that bermaz has an average gross profit margin of up to 15%. currently, lee said all 16 units of the cx-9 supplied by mazda japan for sale in malaysia have already been taken up by local buyers, prior to the june launch. so people are still buying big-ticket items. for those people at that kind of level of income, there is no such thing as reducing their expenditure. if it is the mass market, yes, i agree [consumer spending is lowering]. because [some of] these people live hand-to-mouth every day [so] they cant even consider buying a car. but the middle- to high-income earners, as long as they have steady jobs, they got nothing to worry about, he also said. lee also said bermaz auto is not going to provide any discounts for its products, regardless of the lower sales volume it has been seeing. in fact, the new cx-5 is going to be few thousand ringgit more expensive, because it is new. we dont want to give discounts like the others, because it will affect the resale value of existing customers cars. we need to keep our customers happy, even post sale. because at the end of the day, a happy customer will be the best product ambassador, he added. on the public listing of bermaz autos 60.4%-owned philippines mazda vehicle distributor, bermazauto philippines inc (bap), lee said management remains confident about completing the exercise by the first half of 2017. he estimated that out of the rm82.49 million proceeds to be raised through baps initial public offering, up to rm22 million would be repatriated to baps malaysian shareholders. we have to pay some fees after repatriating the money. so, hopefully, we can pay some dividends after deducting everything, he said. for the nine-months ended jan 31, 2017, bermaz auto declared a dividend payout of 8.5 sen per share, versus 6.9 sen in the previous corresponding period, although earnings per share fell to 8.45 sen from 12.84 sen. a quick check on bloomberg showed that seven research analysts who track bermaz auto have a buy call on it, while another five have given it a hold recommendation. with a consensus target price of rm2.21, they reckon the counter still has a 9.4% upside potential, from its closing of rm2.02 last friday. year to date, the stock has slipped 5.2%, giving it a market capitalisation

(see chart below.)  meanwhile, the industrial property segment in johor is also seeing poor occupancy. as at 3q2016, there were some 11,578 existing stock in johor bahru and kulaijaya. as you pass by the industrial areas in johor, you will see many for sale or to let stickers on the properties, and i think we are going to see more because there will be more incoming supply, he said. however, there are some exceptional cases such as i-park @ senai airport city. the key success factors are build-and-sell or build-and-lease-type properties. i think this is the way to go, at least for the next two years. other than that, he held a positive view on the much-talked-about forest city project by china developer country garden. it is a project that targets foreign buyers so it will not have a direct impact on other local projects. moreover, it is a good way to promote johor and malaysia internationally and it does create a lot of job opportunities. personally, i have a positive view on the project, wee concluded.

[a] holding company discount [could] potentially emerge but sime [darby] shareholders, we believe, may be compensated with shares in the plantation listed co and/or higher dividends post demerger as in the case of iois [corp bhd] demerger of its property unit in 2014, said jp morgan. it noted another factor that could pose a risk is sime darbys low return on equity (roe) of 5%. simes [darby has a] low roe at 5%, [based on financial year ending june 30, 2017 (fy17) estimates] versus 10% to 14% for ioi and kuala lumpur kepong bhd. [however] we believe earnings for sime [darby] have bottomed, after two consecutive years of sharp core earnings decline of over 30% compound annual growth rate over fy15 to fy16. quarterly results, hence, will be key to watch where a recovery in plantation earnings will strengthen the case for value unlocking on asset valuations, it added. in its jan 27 note on sime darby, kenanga research said the group could raise some rm27.2 billion from the pure play exercise. based on our speculated scenario, where sime [darby] maintains a 51% stake in each entity, we estimate some rm27.2 billion [could be raised] from this exercise, with plantation fetching rm19.4 billion and property raising rm 7.8 billion. this represents cash per share of rm4.10 u2026 assuming sime [darby] retains 50% of funds raised and pays out the rest as dividends, this could represent a bumper dividend of rm2 per share or 22% of current share price, kenanga said. the firm opined that sime darbys move to unlock shareholder value is an exciting rerating catalyst considering the potential for a substantial cash payout while maintaining business as usual in the respective segments. sime darbys share price

{"date_posted": "12/1/2017", "title": "cover story: felda in the spotlight", "article": "  the federal land development authoritys (felda) woes seem to be never-ending. for the longest time, the spotlight has been firmly on its 20% associate, felda global ventures holdings bhd (fgv), which appears beset with numerous worries  ageing trees, volatile crude palm oil (cpo) prices, a depreciating ringgit, fraud at its turkish unit  in total, a challenging situation. fgv was floated at rm4.55 apiece in june 2012 and since mid-2014, its share price has been spiralling downwards, reaching its current level of less than rm1.60, largely as a result of weak sentiment. the company went on an acquisition spree from its listing up to 2015, signing deals that drew much criticism for their high valuations. felda itself has been grappling with incessant politicking as its settlements stretch over 54 constituencies deep in the malay heartland, which has long been seen as a vote bank for the ruling barisan nasional coalition. with the 14th general election likely to take place this year or at the latest in august 2018, felda and its units are bound to attract much attention. a few weeks ago, the auditor-generals report 2015 revealed that the planning, implementation, monitoring and management of projects by felda and its subsidiaries were unsatisfactory. the ag recommended that felda plan its procurement and management of projects comprehensively to ensure proper implementation and avoid wastage, and carry out feasibility studies and due diligence before participating in any investment or project, which are the basics of any business. it is worth noting that felda is not on a sound financial footing (see agency worse off than before fgv listing). now with its proposed acquisition  its largest to date  of 37% equity interest in indonesian planter pt eagle high plantations tbk for a whopping us$505.4 million, the authority is likely to continue to hog the limelight. it is paying idr580 per share for eagle high when the counter was trading at only idr298 when the deal was announced. felda is buying the stake from rajawali group, which is owned by indonesian businessman tan sri peter sondakh, who is said to be close to prime minister datuk seri najib razak. such a high price for a non-controlling stake in a loss-making group has become a point of contention. a source close to felda, however, reveals that the final quarter of 2016 has been a good one for eagle high, making it likely that the company will perform from now on. responding to its critics, felda said enterprise value per hectare, and not share price, was a more accurate measurement  eagle highs ev/ha is us$16,000. it also noted that sime darby bhd concluded the purchase of new britain palm oil ltd (nbpol) at an ev/ha of us$27,000 while kuala lumpur kepong bhds planned acquisition of mp evans, at us$15,500 ev/ha, was rejected by the latter. mp evans independent valuation was us$17,300 ev/ha but the board was looking at us$24,000 ev/ha. mp evans is also much smaller with a planted area of 31,400ha while eagle highs planted area is 125,000ha. so felda is purchasing access to land four times the size of mp evans at a lower ev/ha than mp evans independent valuation, the statutory body said. felda officials, meanwhile, are bound by a non-disclosure agreement with eagle high, which is listed on the jakarta stock exchange, preventing them from revealing important details that they say would justify the high price. there is still the approval from the indonesian ministry of agriculture [yet to be obtained]. this is applied for only after a conditional sales and purchase [agreement] is signed. so, its like a chicken-and-egg situation. they (felda and eagle high) have to make an announcement to the stock exchange while they cant disclose many salient points of the deal, a source familiar with feldas deal tells the edge. he says there are safety nets in place that he cannot reveal but when these are made known, he adds, critics of the deal will see the acquisition price is actually fair. also, the safety nets ensure that felda does not end up with the short end of the stick. its like a profit guarantee [from eagle high and rajawali group] that secures felda, he says without elaborating. however, he confirms news reports that felda will be getting a loan from the government and that there are guarantees in place to ensure that eagle high and rajawali group perform, and if they do not, felda will be compensated. its not as good as a soft loan but it is better than a commercial one. these are the best terms felda could get. it also does not help that rajawali group is said to have acquired eagle high at a cheaper price (see next page). nevertheless, the arguments of both the proponents  for now only a small group of felda officials  and the many detractors have their merits.  merits for felda the source familiar with felda says the deal is a good opportunity for the government agency, given the lack of available plantation land in the country. furthermore, the indonesian government is making an exception by allowing felda to buy a chunk of eagle high. its difficult to get such a large piece of plantation land  its scarce now. this is a long-term investment. moreover, the indonesian government seems to be clamping down on the sale of large land banks, the source adds. in a news release on christmas day defending the acquisition, the statutory body said, this is the last opportunity for felda/malaysia or any other foreign party to acquire an indonesian company with massive land bank u2026 the indonesian government made a one-off exception in this deal. while eagle highs planted area is 125,000ha, its total land bank is more than 400,000ha. even though the us$505.4 million price takes into account only the 125,000ha that are already planted, the green light has already been given for the planting of some 300,000ha. the source says apart from palm oil production, rajawali group is involved in many other businesses in which felda could participate but he refrains from further speculation. what felda and eagle high are planning now is all very fluid but the main aim is to stabilise cpo prices. while malaysia and indonesia produce 85% of the worlds cpo, neither has been able to hold sway over its price. it is hoped that with the creation of the council of palm oil producing countries (cpopc) and with felda and eagle high playing a key role in it, the price of the commodity could be steadied. furthermore, the cpopc could put a stop to indonesian companies undercutting their malaysian counterparts in selling cpo to china. the undercutting will end if we have a collaboration with eagle high. there will be a stop to undercutting, which in turn will stabilise cpo prices, the source says. there is also the notion that buying into eagle high will open up the indonesian market to felda. there will be a lot of collaborations and cross-selling between potentially new businesses and synergies for felda in seedling, fertiliser, cpo trading, downstream, oleochemicals and others, the source adds.  what merits? much of the criticism of the acquisition stems from the purportedly high price being forked out by felda. a market watcher familiar with the felda deal says, as at 9m2016, eagle high made a net loss of idr300.35 billion (rm100 million or us$22 million) and was highly geared at 1.32 times. thus, i think eagle high is unlikely to pay dividends for fy2016. assuming that the acquisition is 100% funded by debt and a borrowing rate of 3% of us$505.4 million, the borrowing cost of us$15 million or rm68 million could eat into feldas cash flow. simply put, without an underlying cash flow from the investment, felda might have to tap its cash flow to pay interest obligations instead of the settlers. he disputes feldas contention that share price is not an accepted valuation method. share price may not be an accepted valuation method if the buyer acquires a controlling stake, like in the case of klks proposed conditional takeover of mp evans. also, the pricing for mp evans takes into the consideration the location of its estates, next to klks u2026 [similarly] sime darby acquired 100% of nbpol. in feldas case, it is not acquiring a controlling stake. post-acquisition, rajawali group would own 37.07% while it would own 37%. in feldas case, it would have little influence and, worse still, it might need to inject funds into eagle high should the cash flow remain a problem. felda might report a loss on the investment of as much as rm1 billion or us$242 million if it marked to market the investment. how does felda plan to recoup the losses from this investment? he asks. he goes on to say that scarcity should not be confused with a purchase with no control and no foreseeable cash flow to service debt obligations. also, there is a rule that foreigners with more than 100,000ha of estates in indonesia are not allowed to expand. this, coupled with the illiquidity of eagle highs shares and this being a one-off exception, suggests that felda might not be able to divest its investment. furthermore, has felda explored other avenues? companies such as sime darby and wilmar international ltd might be willing to part with 37% of their estates, which are profitable, at similar prices. the source says while malaysia is a major oil palm player in indonesia, the republics consumer market is dominated by the likes of wilmar international, golden agri-resources ltd and indofood agri resources ltd, and he does not see much synergy. felda might face difficulty in implementing any collaborative plans, he adds. as feldas stake in eagle high would not be a controlling one, it is unlikely to change malaysian palm oil companies controlling holdings in indonesia. nevertheless, more details of the deal could come to light as early as next week with some form of response from the indonesian government. until then, however, naysayers will continue to cast aspersions on the deal.

according to the groups website. sime darby was also highlighted as one of cimb researchs big cap picks in their strategy note on dec 2. we expect the share price to rerate on potential plans to unlock value and better earnings prospects in view of the higher crude palm oil and coal prices in the future quarters, cimb research said. shares in sime darby have shot up from an opening price of rm8.10 this year to rm8.55 at market close last friday, suggesting investors had already begun pricing in expectations on the stock.  by samantha ho  genting malaysia bhd genting malaysia bhd has been touted as a darling of the gaming industry for 2017 on expectations that the genting integrated tourism plan (gitp) will boost its earnings and improve market sentiment due to the legalisation of casino operations in japan. research houses have pointed to expected higher visitor growth as the main catalyst for the stock in light of the full launch of the first phase of the gitp by end-2017, which includes the opening of the 20th century fox theme park. the consensus 12-month target price for genting malaysia is rm5.13 based on estimates by 17 out of 23 investors. the stock was last traded at rm4.73, edging up from its 2017 opening price of rm4.58. fourteen analysts have placed a buy call on the stock, while seven have recommended to hold. according to consensus estimates by

and end-2018 respectively. in the current quarter, the group is expected to complete the launches of sky avenue and sky plaza, which have been fully tenanted at premium rental rates of rm20 per sq ft, according to maybank kim engs strategy report dated dec 19. the weaker ringgit is also expected to be a pull factor for chinese tourists, whose arrivals had been trending upwards by 26% in the cumulative first eight months of 2016, maybank kim eng said.  by samantha ho  ta ann holdings bhd after a year of lacklustre performance, sarawak-based ta ann holdings bhd is set to benefit from the improved demand for timber as well as the turnaround in the plantation sector. the company has been chosen by kenanga research, affinhwang capital and public investment bank research as their stock picks for 2017 in their latest strategy reports. kaf investment bank chief investment officer gan kong yik likes ta ann as he is upbeat about the plantation sector in 2017 with crude palm oil (cpo) price expected to be firmer. furthermore, the demand for timber is anticipated to increase in 2017. another plus point for ta ann is that it is seen as a beneficiary from the stronger us dollar. in a strategy note dated jan 4, kenanga research expects ta ann to be a double beneficiary of the sharp cpo price appreciation, as well as stronger us dollar as the company exports nearly all of its timber products, and sales are denominated in us dollars while costs are entirely in ringgit terms. it also likes ta ann for its sector-leading dividend yield of 3.8% against the average 2.4%. the consensus 12-month target price for ta ann is at rm4.38. six out of nine research houses covering the stock have given it a buy call. the integrated timber producer did not perform well in 2016, falling 5.5% over the past year, underperforming the benchmark fbm klci, which declined by 3%.  by yimie yong  sapurakencana petroleum bhd integrated oil and gas (o&g) services provider sapurakencana petroleum bhd is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the oil production cut pledge between opec and non-opec members. the deal is expected to start a cyclical recovery for the o&g sector and sapurakencana is viewed as a good proxy to ride on the gradual recovery of the sector. several research houses have upgraded their call on the o&g sector recently, after opec and non-opec members pledged to cut production. chosen as one of the stock picks for 2017 by public investment bank research, the research house said the worst is likely behind for sapurakencana. given its ability to undertake comprehensive scope of works across the o&g suite, sapurakencana is said to stand in a better position against its peers on expected recovery in o&g activities. maybank ib research has pointed out that sapurakencana is a proxy to a rising oil price play and monetising its gas assets is a major catalyst. the counter is one of its key buys in the sector. kenanga research has recently upgraded sapurakencana to an outperform call with a target price of rm1.88, following the rerating on the selective upstream players in view of the sustainability of oil prices above us$50 (rm236) per barrel. bloomberg data shows that there are five research houses with a buy call on the stock, and 12 with a hold call. recall that the counter fell by nearly 20% in 2016 and has plummeted by almost 63% in the last three years.  by yimie yong  bumi armada bhd bumi armada bhd, which saw its share price fall more than 40%, may provide another opportunity for investors in anticipation of improving sentiment and operating outlook of the oil and gas sector. ta investment management bhd executive director choo swee kee pointed out that bumi armada shares were oversold in the past two years and expected there would be strong earnings growth for its floating production storage and offloading (fpso) business. bumi armada is one of our top picks for 2017. moving forward, we think there will be stronger earnings growth for the fpso. we also like earnings generated from the fpso as they are seen as more stable, he told the edge financial daily. bumi armada is one of the worlds largest fpso players. public investment bank, which has a buy call on the counter, expects to see a boost in earnings from four major fpso & floating gas solutions (fgs) contributions in 2017, according to its note dated nov 24, 2016. bumi armada posted a net loss of rm96.71 milion in the third quarter ended sept 30, 2016 (3qfy16) versus a net profit of rm70 million a year earlier, on lower revenue. revenue fell 33% to rm377.51 million in 3qfy16 from rm559.46 million in 3qfy15, as it saw lower income from fgs and fpso operations. despite weaker earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) level, uob kay hian said it had assessed that there was no cause for concern as bumi armada was still well within the allowable range for loan covenant on net debt/ebitda.  by yimie yong  protasco bhd protasco bhd is one of the construction players that are expected to benefit from an early general election in 2017. the well-established player in the construction industry is focused on road maintenance works, where most of them are based on concessions awarded by state and federal governments, providing the company with a steady income stream. with the heightened expectation of the 14th general election happening in 2017, there is a potential for extra emergency road maintenance works to be carried out, according to kenanga research. protasco has an outstanding order book of about rm4.4 billion for its maintenance concessions, which could last for about 10 years, contributing about rm400 million to its revenue yearly. looking forward, protasco is eyeing more sizeable concessions, which could potentially contribute another rm100 million to rm200 million to its top-line. for its construction division, management is targeting a replenishment of about rm500 million for the financial year ending dec 31, 2017 that comprises infrastructure and government housing projects such as perumahan penjawat awam 1malaysia (ppa1m). protasco has a strong track record with ppa1m project, in which the company has bagged two phases of ppa1m worth rm900 million. besides a steady income stream, the group also has a decent dividend yield of about 5.6%, far superior in comparison with other small- to mid-cap construction players with an average of 2.9%.  by billy toh"}, "110": {"date_posted": "29/12/2016", "title": "no synergy seen in feldas eagle high buy", "article": "  kuala lumpur: more questions are being raised on the rationale for the purchase of a 37% non-controlling stake by federal land development authority (felda) in indonesias pt eagle high plantations tbk as there would be no unlocking of value for felda. in fact, the us$505.4 million or rm2.26 billion investment should be spent on feldas locally listed arm felda global ventures holdings bhd (fgv). felda is not acquiring a controlling stake in eagle high [and] it cannot effect a mandatory general offer. as a result, felda cannot derive synergy from the buy unlike sime darby bhds acquisition of new britain palm oil ltd (nbpol). since there is no asset [but] only a stake, felda cannot unlock the value from this exercise, an analyst with a local bank, who declined to be quoted, said. the analyst added that the acquisition at us$505.4 million by feldas fic properties sdn bhd (ficp), which is more than double the average share price of eagle high, is a significant premium and therefore too pricey for a loss-making company. the analyst told the edge financial daily via telephone that ficps buy at 580 rupiah (19 sen) per share is expensive and it would take felda a long time before it can reap profits partly because the shares are illiquid. according to eagle highs financial results for [the] first nine months of 2016, it made a loss. the cost of 580 rupiah per share is more than 100% of the average share price. eagle highs share price would have to double before feldas investment can break even. that is the only way i see felda benefiting from the acquisition because it has no control over the management. it might be looking to benefit through dividends with crude palm oil (cpo) price surging beyond rm4,000 per tonne. however, the prospect [of that happening] at this moment is not likely. it will be a long time before felda sees any benefit, the analyst said. last friday, ficp inked a sale and purchase agreement with pt rajawali corp to acquire the stake in jakarta-listed eagle high, which is also one of indonesias largest palm oil companies. eagle high, which is 74.07% owned by pt rajawali, saw net loss widen to rm100 million in its nine months ended sept 30, 2016 (9mfy16) from rm27.4 million last year due to weak fresh fruit bunch (ffb) production and sizeable interest expenses while revenue dipped 22.5% to rm532.7 million compared with rm685.8 million in 9mfy15. according to filings with the indonesia stock exchange, the company suffered a net loss of rm60 million on higher revenue of about rm900 million in its financial year ended dec 31, 2015 (fy15) versus rm63.1 million net loss and rm765.7 million revenue in fy14. asked if the acquisition constituted a bad call, the analyst said the question should instead be why felda was desperate to buy a stake in eagle high. the investment by felda was better spent on fgv which has a lower enterprise value per hectare (ev/ha). this is a decision made by a government entity [so] they must justify the desperate need for this acquisition, the analyst said. to recap, in a seven-point frequently asked questions (faqs) response last friday, felda said the deal will improve feldas crop profile as the average age of eagle highs trees is seven years versus feldas 15 years. there would be a lot of collaborations and cross-selling between felda and eagle high. potential new businesses and synergies for felda group in seedling, fertiliser, crude palm oil trading, downstream/oleochemical, and potential entry to the vast indonesian market of 260 million people for felda groups finished and consumer products, felda said. meanwhile, pt rhb securities indonesia analyst hariyanto wijaya opined that feldas acquisition price at 580 rupiah per share versus the current price of 298 rupiah and potential earnings recovery could be a catalyst for unlocking eagle highs share price. we met with its investor relations personnel last week and the management estimates its ffb production in the fourth quarter of 2016 (4q16) and fy17 to grow by 12% year-on-year (y-o-y) and 30% y-o-y, respectively. they also guided on continued production recovery since september, and that the current cpo price level should enable eagle high to book positive earnings in 4q16. we do not have a rating on the stock. at current ev/ha of us$10,069, it is trading at the lower range of our plantations universe, he said in a sector note on tuesday. hariyanto added that in 2016, about 73,167ha or 64.5% of eagle highs nucleus matured plantation of 113,432ha was in the increasing ffb yield phase (aged four to eight years). the alleged expensive acquisition has been the subject of controversy among several quarters including cimb group holdings bhd chairman datuk seri nazir razak, opposition politicians and researchers. among their criticisms, they claim that felda should not validate the soundness of the purchase on the basis of ev/ha as it did not own a controlling shareholding in eagle high. pkr policymaker mohd rafizi ramli told a press conference yesterday that felda was using ev/ha justification on the basis of how much value one can get from planted acreage. felda reasoned that it is almost impossible to find huge acreage of that size in indonesia because nobody is going to sell. now, firstly, you are not in control of eagle high plantations, felda plans to buy a 37% stake at exorbitant price, yet at the same time it does not have the controlling stake. when you dont have a controlling stake, it is rather ridiculous to have access to huge acreage of plantation. value can only be added when there is synergy through a controlling stake, he said. according to reports, pt rajawali founder peter sondakh will retain a controlling stake in eagle high. in its faqs response, felda stated kuala lumpur kepong bhds recent final offer of us$15,500 ev/ha rejected by mp evans group plcs board of directors was valued by mp evans independent valuers as us$17,300 ev/ha. mp evans asked for valuation of us$24,000 ev/ha for the company. [however,] at us$505.4 million, felda is purchasing the eagle high stake at us$16,000 ev/ha, felda said, adding that mp evans planted land is 31,400ha while eagle highs planted area is 125,000ha. felda is purchasing access to land four times the size of mp evans at a lower ev/ha than mp evans independent valuation, felda said while noting that sime darbys purchase of nbpol was at an ev/ha of us$27,000. to this, mohd rafizi said felda should talk about the synergistic value it can get from the acquisition that can put it or fgv in a game-changing position against its competitors. buying 37% at that exorbitant price and not even able to consolidate eagle highs results into felda, is just madness. so what will happen is felda will continue to show a weak balance sheet, so it is pointless to talk about the ev[/ha] because you cant consolidate. similar to what is happening now where felda can only take dividend [although] its top results and balance sheet are still weak but with additional rm2 billion debt [due to the acquisition], with no result to show apart from the dividend every now and then. therefore, dont even begin talking about ev[/ha] because it is only relevant when you have control to do with all those acreage you get, he said. meanwhile, bernama has reported that feldas decision to acquire a stake in eagle high was vital to its progress as it had reached a stage where it needed to reinvent itself after six decades in the industry. felda director-general of management muzamil mohd nor said failing to do this would mean felda would remain stagnant, while others in the global palm oil sector were moving forward. expounding the rationale behind the transformative deal, muzamil said the deal was strategically too important to pass up as it would make felda one of the biggest global palm oil plantation companies. if we dont do this deal, we will just be on the sidelines, being forced to watch our competitors grow by leaps and bounds in this highly lucrative sector, he said in an interview yesterday."}, "111": {"date_posted": "19/12/2016", "title": "mitrajaya to bag rm400m job in ara damansara", "article": "  mitrajaya holdings bhd is understood to be close to winning a construction job in ara damansara after bidding just above rm400 million for it, an industry source reveals. offered by sime darby ara damansara development bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of conglomerate sime darby bhd, the contract entails the development of 756 serviced apartments in four 17-storey blocks, 24 duplexes on nine floors of a podium consisting of serviced apartments, two floors of shopoffices, parking space and common facilities at lot pt4002, jalan pju 1a/41, ara damansara. it is learnt that mitrajaya pipped a number of its peers for the contract because, according to some of the companies it beat, its rate was very competitive. mitrajaya managing director tan eng piow could not be contacted for comment. if industry players are to be believed, mitrajaya may not make much in terms of margins due to its competitive price but the contract is expected to strengthen its order book. according to a report by kenanga investment bank bhd late last week, mitrajayas construction order book stood at rm1.35 billion, providing earnings visibility for another 1u00bd years. with the ara damansara project, its order book would be bumped up to rm1.71 billion. year to date, mitrajaya has secured rm577 million worth of contracts, making up 72% of our rm800 million order book assumption with rm223 million remaining to be achieved. on the back of a rm2 billion tender book, we believe our target is achievable either by year end or early fy2017, says kenanga. some of the notable jobs secured by mitrajaya last year and early this year are three blocks of 1,062 public apartments (under ppa1m) for putrajaya homes; infrastructure works for the pahang technology park in gambang; civil and infrastructure works for the refinery and petrochemical integrated development project in pengerang, johor; two blocks of 800 public apartments (under ppa1m) for putrajaya homes; and a building complex and external works in section 13, petaling jaya. these are collectively valued at about rm920 million. the companys three main revenue generators are its construction arm, its property development arm and the blue valley golf and country estate in south africa. mitrajaya registered record earnings and revenue in its financial year ended dec 31, 2015, chalking up a net profit of rm86.58 million on revenue of rm890.73 million. its current year is likely to be just as good with net profit in its first nine months of fy2016 ended sept 30 coming in at rm74.98 million on sales of rm692.46 million. annualised, this means mitrajaya could record as much as rm99.97 million in net profit from rm923.28 million in revenue  a new record. kenanga is bullish about the companys earnings, forecasting a net profit of rm130.1 million on revenue of rm969.7 million in fy2016. it has an outperform call on the stock and a target price of rm1.49, which is at a 21% premium to mitrajayas closing price of rm1.23 last friday. according to kenanga, its target price implies 11 times fy2017 fully diluted per (price-earnings ratio), which is in line with the targeted forward per range of 9 to 13 times for contractors with small to medium market capitalisation. in its notes accompanying its financial results, mitrajaya says barring unforeseen circumstances, the group expects a strong financial performance in fy2016. as at sept 30, mitrajaya had deposits with licensed financial institutions of rm24.32 million, and cash and bank balances of rm20.62 million. on the other side of the balance sheet, it had short-term debt commitments of rm209.06 million and long-term borrowings of rm35.38 million. mitrajayas finance cost for the nine months ended sept 30 was rm5.7 million. last week, the company announced that pentadbir tanah kota tinggi, johor, had notified it of the compulsory acquisition of almost six acres of its land in sungai buntu, pengerang, south johor, for the development of the pengerang petroleum complex. the company is being offered rm31.45 million in compensation. the sale puts the lands value at rm121 psf, which kenanga views as positive as there are currently no development plans for the land. the sale will immediately reduce mitrajayas net gearing to 0.29 times (from 0.35 times as at 3q2016). additionally, the sale registers a rm28.8 million gain on disposal on the back of the lands existing book value of rm10.40 psf, it says. mitrajayas largest shareholder is tan with a 40.67% stake. it has no other substantial shareholders."}, "112": {"date_posted":

us-based communications and lobbying company waxman strategies, working as mighty earth, and gabon-based ngo brainforest. olam adds that it was disappointed to see some important factual errors, and several key misinterpretations of olams policies and implementation. among the criticisms in the mighty report that olam takes issue with include allegations that the company is deforesting in gabon and will not sign a no-deforestation commitment that adheres to hcsa (high carbon stock approach) methodology. olam says it cannot sign up to the no-deforestation commitments due to the lack of available land in gabon to get high-yielding plantations up and running. much of gabons non-forested land is infertile savannah or swamps, which makes it necessary to include some highly degraded forest lands, it adds. we agree with gabons sovereign right to convert a tiny percentage of its least valuable forested land for agriculture, so long as it is responsibly and transparently done, olam says. in addition, olam also disagreed with mighty reports allegation that its third-party sourcing of palm oil comes from companies that are environmentally destructive and causing fire and haze. olam says this referred to its palm trading business in asia. for our third party palm sourcing, we are still a small player, accounting for only 0.4% of global palm volumes in 2016, says olam

our current suppliers have either signed this code or have their own codes consistent with ours, verghese adds. olam adds that it had reduced its supplier list from 48 in 2014 to 14 currently, after

this could be a bumper year for plantation companies as the price of crude palm oil (cpo) has rebounded more than 36% to rm2,700 per tonne, from a five-year low of rm1,982 in august last year. plantation players could ride the recent positive sentiment due to reduced cpo production resulting from el niu00f1o and the likelihood that malaysia and indonesia will implement biodiesel mandates. the government is also seeking ways to boost palm oil exports to china following prime minister datuk seri najib razaks visit. plantation industries and commodities minister datuk seri mah siew keong tells the edge that measures to be taken in the coming months are expected to boost cpo exports to the worlds second largest economy. palm oil exports to china dropped 42% from january to august, compared with last year, he notes. malaysia was once chinas largest supplier of palm oil but over the last few years, it has dropped to third place due to increased competition from other edible oils, such as soy and sunflower oil. indonesia is now the worlds largest palm oil producer. we went [to china] and had discussions, asking them to take up more of our palm oil. we hope more companies in china will buy palm oil from malaysia, he says over the phone. mah says the feedback from the chinese authorities has been positive and believes this will help stop cpo exports to china from further contracting. indeed, he has seen signs of a pickup recently. despite the positive catalysts, fund managers and analysts remain sceptical about the demand for palm oil. furthermore, they find plantation stocks on bursa malaysia more expensive in terms of valuation than their peers listed in singapore and indonesia. the long-term average price-earnings ratio (per) of malaysian planters is 21.1 times while plantation counters in indonesia and singapore are trading at pers of 17.8 and 14.3 times respectively. positive factors, such as the supply disruption caused by el niu00f1o, have been largely priced in. the concern is really that demand growth is not really there to excite [the market], pheim asset management (asia) pte ltd chief investment officer james lau says in an email reply. he says the continued soft crude oil price does not augur well for the cpo price as it could become a stumbling block, stopping people from switching to biodiesel, unless the government makes its use mandatory. the b10 biodiesel mandate has been delayed several times but sources say there will be progressive rollouts of b10 and b7 blends for the transport and industrial sectors from dec 1. on efforts to increase palm oil exports to china, lau says that is good news but it remains to be seen whether this will happen. kaf investment funds bhd chief investment officer gan kong yik concurs, saying that the positive factors have to some extent been priced in when it comes to the valuations of plantation stocks. he has a neutral stance on the sector. increased exports to china, i think, is a temporary catalyst. the key is that the global demand for cpo must improve. for investors to turn bullish again, global demand must be strong, and so far, it has not been, gan tells the edge over the phone. he is concerned that the anticipated slower economic growth next year will affect the demand. a plantation analyst with a foreign bank, meanwhile, points out that the valuations of malaysian plantation stocks are usually higher than in indonesia and singapore. as such, he says it might be difficult to justify a buy recommendation for malaysian plantation counters, adding that most malaysian planters are trading at a per of above 20 times. she believes the potential increase in exports to china is positive for malaysia, but will not change the supply and demand equation, and thus, will not support the cpo price. if china is buying more from malaysia, it means other countries will buy more from indonesia. it does not change supply and demand, she tells the edge. increased demand or a falling supply will be the main factors that will drive the sector. demand is steady, but supply is plentiful. this time, the cpo price rally is due to a lower supply. when production is normalised, cpo prices will normalise, she explains. the analyst foresees cpo prices remaining at the current level until the second quarter next year. she forecasts the average cpo price to be at rm2,500 per tonne. according to bloomberg data, the average price of cpo has been on the rise since august last year. it rebounded 46% to rm2,901.53 on sept 30, from rm1,982.33 on aug 31, but retraced to rm2,700 last thursday. there are, however, fund managers who are still positive on the outlook for the sector. uob asset management executive director and ceo lim suet ling sees near-term potential for planters. while the cpo price has gained about 25% year to date, the bursa malaysia plantation index has increased only 2%. this could suggest that the rise of the cpo price may not be fully reflected in some plantation companies, she says via email. the bursa malaysia plantation index stood at 7,733.898 points last thursday. lim expects an increase in palm oil exports to china to be a positive driver for the palm oil sector. malaysias palm oil exports to china ytd have declined about 30%, mainly due to an ample supply of rapeseed oil and soyoil. china has seen increased demand for animal feed, which has led to a jump in soymeal production and its by-product, soyoil. the situation has been exacerbated by an increased supply of rapeseed oil as the chinese government released stocks from its state reserve programme. apart from that, the successful implementation of biodiesel mandates by the malaysian and indonesian governments would help to provide some support to cpo prices, lim says. malaysia currently has a b7 mandate and is targeting to implement a b10 mandate from december. the full implementation of the b10 mandate is expected to consume 1.1 tonnes of cpo, compared with 0.8 tonnes for b7. in indonesia, it has been reported that the energy ministry has made it mandatory for non-subsidised diesel fuel to contain a 20% mix of biodiesel. if successfully implemented, the demand for cpo for biodiesel in the country could more than double. the outlook for cpo prices in the near term will be well supported by the seasonal downward trend in palm oil production as well as the lag effect of el niu00f1o, which is expected to persist until the second quarter of next year, lim says. cpo prices have risen on the back of a year-on-year decline in production for the first time in the last decade due to dry weather brought about by el niu00f1o. lim says cpo prices would be higher if not for ample soyoil in the market as we have seen record soyoil supplies since 2013... any event (including weather disruption) that affects the supply of other edible oils, including soyoil, would be positive for cpo prices, she says. perhaps, investors who bet on plantation counters should be more selective. we have been in the market for plantation stocks since last year and our top picks were those with a tree age profile that would support production growth with marginal cost incurrence, says pheim asset managements lau. following el niu00f1o, however, he is now focusing on plantation companies with strong production recovery supported by prudent management or with appealing dividend yields, such as genting plantations bhd, and non-pure planters like ta ann holdings bhd and mkh bhd. from a regional perspective, he says, investors will find cheaper plantation stocks in indonesia, and there has been no adequate explanation for this, although the general refrain has been that malaysian planters are better managed. moreover, he believes the gap is not that wide anymore. as most of them are trading at pers above 20 times, age profile and cost of production are key to look at, gan says, adding that he prefers plantation players that have a younger tree age profile. he sees sarawak palm oil bhd as the choice for a longer-term play because of its younger age profile and recent purchase of plantation land, which should bear fruit in the next three years, despite the fact that the group had raised funds for the acquisition. for a short-term play, gan sees th plantations bhd as a warm-up stock as it has been trading at a five-year low. th plantations, which is 74% owned by lembaga tabung haji, saw its share price halved to rm1.13 last thursday from a five-year high of rm2.23 in march 2012. to gan, as long as cpo prices remain between rm2,500 and rm2,700 per tonne, it will be positive for most players as their cost of production ranges from rm1,800 to rm1,900 per tonne. although the plantation analyst with the foreign bank does not have any buy calls on malaysian planters, she says sime darby bhd could be worth a look as the new chairman of permodalan nasional bhd, tan sri abdul wahid omar, may drive changes at the conglomerate. sime darbys share price has rebounded 18.7% to rm8.24 from its five-year low of rm6.94 on sept 11 this year, but is still lower than its five-year high of rm9.21 in february last year.

[to maintain steady earnings growth] for fy2018 onwards, we are trying to secure one or two more privatisation projects within the next six months. their values are sizeable, says yong, but declines to elaborate. crest builder has won another jv project with prasarana to develop vacant land around the kelana jaya lrt station. yong says the project is expected to commence in late 2018 or 2019. we are also looking at developing other parcels belonging to prasarana, which are along rail lines. we are waiting for the next few tenders to be called. they seem satisfied with our performance so far, as we have been assisting them in all the authority clearances [in relation to [emailprotected] ampang and the upcoming kelana jaya project], he says. we have been doing a lot of property projects on our own. we hope to do more jvs with government-linked companies, going forward. the advantage of such jvs is that they ease our cash flow in terms of payment for the land and require smaller capital outlays. the downside of jvs is that approvals take a long time as they involve many tiers. on its jv with the malaysian rubber board to develop a rm1.33 billion mixed-use development in jalan ampang, yong says the development order has been submitted. we are targeting to commence construction in the second half of 2018. crest builder has transformed itself from a pure construction player to a contractor-cum-developer. for fy2016, it expects the profit contribution from its property business to be 60%, with the construction segment contributing the remaining 40%. an ideal ratio is 70% from property and 30% from construction, says yong. i dont intend to go fully into property development because our bread and butter is still construction. we want to be boutique-based, meaning i will do anything apart from townships. townships are not our forte and the capital outlay is also very heavy. we prefer to go for mature neighbourhoods with a faster turnaround time like seven to eight years, he explains. the group is looking at a steady replenishment of its construction order book of between rm500 million and rm600 million a year. currently, our gross order book stands at rm1.28 billion, of which rm1.1 billion is unbuilt, he says. meanwhile, crest builder continues to seek buyers for its two assets in petaling jaya, which are valued at rm280 million. one of them is the crest  a 16-storey commercial building at 3 two square where the groups headquarters are located  which could fetch as much as rm130 million. the other is tierra crest, a 17-storey commercial building in kelana jaya valued at about rm150 million. as a construction company, i find that owning these two properties puts heavy stress on our cash flow [to service the loans] and i am sitting on two pots of cash. as such, we have been looking at monetising the two assets to free up capital, says yong. crest builders cash flow is a major concern for most investors. the cash and cash equivalents of the group stood at rm112.22 million as at june 30, 2016, while its short and long-term borrowings amounted to rm669.01 million. yong explains that the bulk of the borrowings consists of long-term loans secured against the crest and tierra crest and a rm510 million sukuk issued to finance its universiti teknologi mara campus project in tapah, perak. stripping out these borrowings, our gearing is at a comfortable level of below 0.4 times. yong notes that at present, there is no plan for the group to go to the capital market to raise funds as he thinks that crest builders securities are trading below par. we would rather wait for the market to pick up first, he adds. last november, in view of the market conditions, the group aborted plans for a proposed placement of up to 10% of its issued share capital to raise rm29.8 million. yong, formerly the executive director of the group, is the second generation at the groups helm. he assumed the leadership role on sept 3 last year and, at 33 years old, is one of the youngest managing directors of a publicly traded company in the country. his father, the late yong soon chow, 63, was the group managing director and founder. yong now shares the responsibility of running the group with his three sisters and mother. his mother, koh hua lan, and his sister, yong tiok keng, are executive directors of the group. the yong family currently own 38.18% of crest builder via their private vehicle sc yong holdings sdn bhd. yong says his family have no intention of paring their stake in crest builder and want to raise it as they think the stock is undervalued. the stock closed at 90 sen last thursday, giving the group a market capitalisation of rm153.62 million.

says beh. he found this to be a widespread phenomenon among the extremely wealthy in other parts of the world as well. i remember this 18-year-old who received an allowance of us$100,000 a month. when he turned 21, it was upped to us$200,000. that is close to rm1 million and he could do whatever he wanted with it. and guess what? he would use it up every month, spending money on all sorts of nonsense. behs father tested him the same way. when i went to high school in the uk, he gave me a lump sum that was enough to cover a year or two. he told me i could do whatever i wanted with it but also remember that if i abused it, i would limit my own credibility and he would never give me this kind of money again, says beh. a lot of my friends were from billionaire families, but their parents really limited their allowances to see how they would survive. my father was from another school of thought. he thought that if you want to see how crazy a guy can be, give him money and power. beh acquitted himself admirably. he did not run out of money and he did not make the headlines for doing all the wrong things. he worked hard academically and played polo. in fact, he was the captain of the england under-21 team. he even managed to go the university of virginia in the us as a polo scholar. he completed a four-year double major (in economics and asian studies) in three years and went to work at one of the oldest investment banks on wall street  dominick & dominick. this was just before the crash and wall street was still floating on a tide of irrational exuberance. at the time, a lot of chinese companies were going public. we did plenty of reverse mergers. later, i joined another investment bank called maxim, which did 99% of all the special purpose acquisition corporations (spacs) in the us, he says. beh was fascinated by what investment bankers did and how they did it. they know what deals are out there and who has the money to invest in them. they were the connectors. but when they got too greedy, when they started selling snake oil, when they didnt even know what they were selling, that was when things went wrong. he was there towards the end of the wolf of wall street days. yeah, i would say the movie was true. i have seen when they close deals, they party hard, buy bottles, buy models. it is all real, it is not made up. he was also there when it all went pear-shaped. i had roommates who worked at lehman brothers and bear stearns and they told me that a few of the partners literally had heart attacks when they were filing chapter 11 [bankruptcy]. they had lost their entire net worth because everything was tied to the stocks. although there was a bloodbath on wall street, beh remained relatively unaffected. i still had my job at the end of it, but the deal flow had dried up. after a few months of doing nothing much, i became restless. i still got paid, but what was the point? so i said, i have seen enough and it is time to go home, he recalls. did he miss the perks when he came home? no, he says. it was nice while it lasted, but not necessary. i take commercial flights and i can take budget airlines; no big deal  whatever gets you from point a to b. when someone else is paying versus you paying out of your own pocket, there is a difference, says beh. naturally, not everyone took the transition lightly. it is the difference between viewing the perks as a tasting menu, where you taste and enjoy them, or as a drug, where you need this and without it, you are dead, he says. why didnt he lose his head? it was because he had seen it all, even at that young age, having rubbed shoulders with the glitterati of the world because of polo. i met the sultan of brunei when i was 14. and i have played against prince william and prince harry. polo, as winston churchill says, is like a passport to diplomacy. you get to meet heads of state, top lawyers and bankers and other celebrities. sports did give beh a good platform but it was what he did with it that mattered. i think there are a lot of fortunate kids out there who have the platform. the problem with them is they have everything and no drive to do anything. when he returned, the lifestyle adjustment was no problem. the job adjustment was another thing altogether. wall street was a great experience because we were at the centre of things. when i joined my family business, i found it unsexy. it was boring, archaic, even ancient. but somewhere down the road, i realised that in this industry, you could touch lives in a positive manner, he says. people would come and thank me because they had early detection and so were able to treat their cancer. i felt that by doing this, i was building the karma money; future points. but it was not enough. although as the eldest son, his position in his fathers company was assured, he did not want to be perceived as someone who made it because of who his father was. beh worked hard to build the company when he took over as managing director, increasing the number of branches from 50 to more than 200 in six years and growing the workforce from a few hundred to a few thousand. but he was not satisfied. one day, a friend of mine, joel neoh, approached me. he is the partner and ex-ceo of groupon asia-pacific. we knew each other because we were ernst & young entrepreneurs of the year in the emerging category for different years, he says. he told me what i was doing with my family business was very interesting, but why didnt i want to grow faster? i said, how much faster can i grow? anyone can tell you that bp healthcare has grown so fast in a short period of time. but neoh had a plan. he asked me why i didnt use technology and invited me to come on board bookdoc as a co-founder. he would help on the technology side because his expertise was to scale and would leave the industry know-how to me. bookdoc allows users to search and make appointments with healthcare professionals, such as doctors, specialists, dentists and physiotherapists. in just seven months, he managed to sign up some major players. i got socso to be my partner for the next five years. i got agoda, a us$66 billion company, which is the largest aggregator of hotels online to come on board. this was its first ever tie-up with a start-up. beh works very hard. i used to travel for work and for polo, but never like this. i have never travelled so much in my life. i am up at 5am to take the earliest flight to singapore, arrive there at 8.30am, have a meeting there and take the red-eye home so i am back by midnight. and the next day, i am on a flight to hong kong. i have been travelling like that every week, he says. he is 31 now and he admits that he does get tired. but when i think of what i have managed to achieve, it is a thrill that money cannot buy. no start-up has grown at this rate; it is unprecedented. although his previous networks have opened doors, it is how he uses them that matters. i keep knocking on doors. my greatest strength is persistence. i keep going until i get it done. he has already signed up an impressive list of partners, but he is nowhere near done. i want to look for other partners. the largest accommodation aggregator is airbnb. i got connected with the founder and boom! i think we are going to work with them as well. the list of investors reads like a whos who. when i first started, there was joel. then, i got the ministry of healths director-general datuk dr maimunah hamid, former chairman of the malaysian communications and multimedia commission datuk sharil tarmizi, former hong leong bank ceo datuk yvonne cheah, and the head of corporate finance at sime darby healthcare. the last investor we got was from the brunei royal family. how did he manage to do this? it is just my track record working. some of them, i didnt even ask. they came up to me and said, hey, i heard you are doing this. you are my friend. how come you never asked me?  investment approach behs approach to investment reflects his age and consequently, high-risk appetite. at this stage, i am a young guy and i can take a lot of risks. you can see this from the fact that most of my time, effort and money are being spent on a start-up right now. if i make it, it will be a big home run and if i dont, well, it is what it is, he shrugs with an attempt at nonchalance. as for stocks, he is both an investor and a punter. during the financial crisis, i bought the stocks of all the financial firms. today, i am like a 100% up on nearly all of the stocks. i bought ge, ing, bear stearns  which went belly up  and citibank. overall, i made money. some are just trades. i play on the thing called a mean reversion, he says. mean reversion refers to buying when bad news causes a stock to tank. beh believes that in most cases, the stock will move back up again. and for the most part, he has been proved right. for instance, beh says he bought a stock called sirus at 70 us cents and it is now trading at us$5. with mean reversion, you invest in strategy, not play on the fundamentals. he has made some traditional investments such as property. i own properties in malaysia and abroad. i am quite fortunate. i bought a nice apartment in new york back when the exchange rate was rm3 to us$1. so, i already made on that, plus i get rental income. i always believe that in places like new york, property prices will be a steady state or going up, but never coming down because of the scarcity of properties and the regulations about tearing down buildings to build new ones. his philosophy in life is simple. i think everyone has a purpose whether they are rich or poor. people are created for a reason and you have to determine how far you want to go, how much you want to contribute and how much you want to earn."}, "128": {"date_posted": "23/8/2016", "title": "klci falls 8pts on sime darby, profit taking", "article": " kuala lumpur (aug 23): the fbm klci fell eight points or 0.5% on sime darby bhd share losses and as investors took profit after the index's recent gains. overnight us share market losses could have also dictated the malaysian stocks today. at 5pm, the klci closed at 1,683.07 points after falling to its intraday low at 1,680 points yesterday (aug 22), the klci rose 3.39 points. today, sime darby shares fell 34 sen to rm7.80 with some 14 million units traded. the stock fell after the diversified group said net profit dropped to rm2.41 billion in financial year ended june 30, 2016 from rm2.43 billion a year earlier. sime darby also said it might raise about rm2.38 billion from a planned placement of 316.35 million new shares at an indicative rm7.51 each. the move is expected to expand the group's issued share base, hence, anticipation of earnings per share dilution. analysts said the klci could be ripe for profit taking. jf apex securities bhd research head lee chung cheng said the index's decline was mainly due to profit taking as well as overnight losses in us share markets. \"it (klci) is mostly on the downside today due to profit taking. moving forward, i think the market will still move sideways as there is no clear directions at the moment. \"the market still lacks the positive catalyst at this point of time,\" lee said. bursa malaysia saw 1.84 billion shares worth rm1.74 billion traded. decliners outnumbered gainers at 579 against 263 respectively. top gainer was eita resources bhd while dutch lady milk industries bhd was the leading decliner. airasia x bhd was the most actively-traded stock. across asian share markets, japan's nikkei 225 fell 0.61% while hong kong's hang seng added 1.02 points. reuters reported that asia shares inched up on tuesday while oil fell for a second session as investors awaited clues on whether the federal reserve will raise us interest rates this year.

"11/8/2016", "title": "cover story:corporate malaysia paid lower dividends in 1q2016 ", "article": "  in the current low interest rate environment, investors are increasingly turning to dividend-paying stocks for yields and safety. despite declining earnings in the past two years, most companies listed on bursa malaysia have been able to maintain their dividend payouts at above 3%. however, some pertinent questions come to mind, especially for income investors: can the companies maintain dividends amid a slowing economy? what sectors and companies are reducing dividends? and more importantly, are there any sectors or companies that are paying better dividends? by compiling data from cash flow statements, chart 1 shows the dividends paid to shareholders in the past five years and the first quarter of 2016. while companies may pay dividends in the next quarter after they have declared the quantum, most of them pay out at a predictable frequency and time every year, making such cash flow data comparable on a year-on-year basis. that said, it should be noted that the dividend data from cash flow statements is lagging by a quarter and it disregards the sources of the funds, that is, the dividends could come from non-operating activities. for instance, companies could sell their assets and pay dividends with the proceeds. as shown in chart 1, dividends paid by bursa-listed companies dropped 6.3% to rm11.6 billion from a year ago, albeit by a lesser extent compared with an 18.4% fall in aggregate 1q2016 corporate earnings. sectors that paid lower dividends in the first quarter  a rm2.3 billion reduction  include plantation, telecommunications, oil and gas and automotive (see chart 2).  dividend cut by heavyweight sectors the plantation sector accounted for 28.7% of the rm2.3 billion reduction in dividends, followed by conglomerate (26%), telecommunications (17.3%), oil and gas equipment and services (5.8%) and automotive (3.8%). together, the five sectors (based on bloomberg classification) accounted for 82% of the amount. at the company level, conglomerate sime darby bhd saw the biggest reduction in dividend payout  rm639 million  in the first quarter due to lower earnings from its plantation, industrial and motor segments (see table 1). note that the plantation segment was the groups largest earnings contributor, accounting for a quarter of its revenue and a third of its operating income in fy2015. other plantation companies that cut dividend sharply include kuala lumpur kepong bhd (klk) and ioi corp bhd, which were affected by weak crude palm oil prices last year. while klk saw its fy2015 earnings fall 12.3% to rm869.9 million from a year ago, ioi corps earnings plunged 95% to rm168.1 million from fy2014, mainly due to its large us dollar debt exposure. as for kulim malaysia bhd, the company paid a special dividend of rm500 million in 1q2015 instead of an interim dividend like in 2014. this came about after it disposed of new britain palm oil ltd to sime darby. having completed its capital reduction and repayment exercise on july 5, kulim is in the process of being taken private by controlling shareholder johor corp. over at digi.com bhd, the dividend cut reflects its lower profitability due to intensifying competition and the fact that it has been paying out close to 100% of its profits in the past three years. as maxis bhd has so far maintained its profitability relatively well, the dividend cut last year was because it lowered its dividend payout ratio to below 100% and stopped borrowing to pay dividends. shares of maxis and digi have been recovering since may, partly due to decent yields  3.3% for maxis and 4.3% for digi. nonetheless, with competitive pressures limiting growth opportunities (for example, telekom malaysia bhds (tm) new 4g lte mobile service webe) and the upcoming spectrum reallocation exercise, dividend upside for this sector seems limited and there is a possibility of further dividend cuts due to either spectrum fees or lower profitability.  higher dividends by glcs sectors that paid higher dividends contributed rm1.5 billion more in the first quarter, mostly led by individual companies (see chart 3 and table 2). tm, misc bhd, petronas chemicals group bhd, petronas gas bhd  government-linked companies (glcs) with a dominant industry position or strong parentage backing  accounted for over 60% of the amount. however, at a closer look, things are not exactly rosy. for tm, the rm455 million paid out in 1q2016 was due to a change in the timing of dividend payments. the integrated telecoms service provider, which is 28.6%-owned by khazanah nasional bhd, changed the dividend type of its second payout for fy2015 from final to second interim dividend, accelerating its dividend payment by two to three months to 1q2016. misc, which is 62.7%-owned by petroliam nasional bhd (petronas), raised its dividend payout ratio from 10.7% in 2013 to 54.3% last year. the shipping company paid out rm401.7 million in 2014 and 50% more last year, although earnings grew only 12% in the same period. in 1h2016, dividends rose to rm1 billion, 66.7% higher than that of last year. the higher dividends could be attributed to the disposal of its international tank terminal business, vtti bv, for rm3.4 billion in 4q2015 as part of its initiative to hive off uncompetitive non-core businesses. misc is currently divesting its logistics arm, misc integrated logistics sdn bhd, which is expected to bring about rm358 million in total proceeds. the stock took a dive in late april from rm8.90 to a one-year low of rm7.25 on may 9, following consensus earnings cut due to the weaker outlook for petroleum and liquefied natural gas shipping rates. data compiled by bloomberg shows that the street expects miscs operating profit to decline 21% this year, with a lower yield of 2.9%. another petronas subsidiary that paid higher dividends is petronas chemicals. it paid 25% or rm160 million more in the first quarter. as the petrochemical company has been paying out about 50% of its profits, the bigger payout was because of improved profitability last year. despite a 7.3% drop in revenue due to lower crude oil prices, net profit rose 12.9% year on year to rm2.8 billion, thanks to a higher plant utilisation rate of 85% and weaker ringgit. supported by its strong cash flow generation, petronas chemicals is expanding its capacity over the next few years through the sabah ammonia urea project and the refinery and petrochemical integrated development project in johor. taking the multi-year capacity expansion plan into account, analysts are forecasting 10.2% earnings growth for the company next year. other non-glcs that paid higher dividends in 1q2016 include property investment company selangor properties bhd, brewer heineken malaysia bhd, hong leong bank bhd and hard disk drive component maker jcy international bhd. both selangor properties and jcy incurred a loss in the latest quarter, largely due to foreign exchange losses on overseas investments and receivables/hedging instruments. mounting dividend risk with declining profits while companies could liquidate assets or borrow to pay dividends, the ability to sustain and grow dividends is still driven by profitability. as shown in chart 4, corporate profits in the past five quarters have been particularly impacted by rising operating costs as well as ringgit volatility, which led to foreign exchange losses and higher import costs. despite the declining earnings from 1q2015 to 4q2015, listed companies have been paying a similar level of dividends throughout the year, resulting in a jump in dividend payout ratio from 53% in 1q2015 to 72% in 4q2015. as this practice is not sustainable, 1q2016 saw a reduction in dividends. nevertheless, as some companies may not pay dividends in the first quarter, the 1q2016 dividend data may not be complete and sufficient enough to identify sectors or firms that have been growing their dividends. hence, we have also compiled a list of the top 50 companies that have paid higher dividends (in absolute value) in the past five years (see table 3 on page 68). many of these dividend growers have unique competitive strengths to capture the growth of their respective industry. that said, past performance is by no means indicative of future results and certain companies like digi and sime darby have reduced their dividends due to new industry developments. as dividends include proceeds from asset disposals, an increased payout could indicate a business restructuring or change in business model and, thus, may warrant a closer look. for example, both misc and rce capital bhd paid out much higher dividends last year as a result of initiatives to focus on their core business or to achieve a more efficient capital structure."}, "131": {"date_posted": "25/7/2016", "title": "sime darby range bound , says

"article": " this article first appeared in corporate, the edge malaysia weekly, on june 27 - july 3, 2016. while most analysts agree that malaysias fundamentals will not be significantly affected by britains withdrawal from the european union (brexit), many fear the spillover effects and inevitable uncertainties could weigh on the local economy and financial markets. nomura securities warned clients not to underestimate the depth and reach of financial market contagion to asia. in its note last friday, it says that taking the view that the financial and economic impact would only be limited to the uk due to its economic size is too simplistic for two reasons. first, we expect non-trivial spillover to the euro areas economy and financial markets. while the value of merchandise exports from the rest of the eu to the uk is only 3% of the rest of the eus gdp, the uks position as a global financial hub  the uk financial sectors assets account for more than eight times its gdp  leaves the rest of the eu much more exposed to the uk in terms of financial and investment linkages, in part reflecting the uks relatively liberalised domestic market and its strong legal framework and institutions, nomura says. secondly, it fears that brexit could further inflame anti-eu sentiment in other member states, increasing fears that they would also leave the union. asian equities and currencies tumbled last friday after 51.9% of the uk electorate voted to leave the eu the day before. the fbm klci declined 1.7% to 1,611 before recovering to 1,634. save for the south korean won, the ringgit was the hardest-hit among the major asian currencies, sliding 2.1% against the us dollar to 4.09. we believe that the overall implications of the vote to leave are negative for emerging currencies, particularly the central and eastern european currencies. in addition to this, currencies with large foreign portfolio exposure and wide external imbalances will also face large downside pressure. these currencies are also the most risk off currencies and include the indonesian rupiah, malaysian ringgit, turkish lira and brazilian real, writes hsbc global research in a recent report. nonetheless, the biggest victims of brexit appear to be the british pound and the uk and european markets. the pound took a pounding, depreciating 8% against the greenback while the euro stoxx and ftse lost 8.4% and 3.5% of their market value respectively in the first few hours of trading last friday. in contrast, us treasuries, the yen, the swiss franc and gold rose as investors flocked to safe-haven assets amid heightened market volatility. local brokers generally think that brexit will have a minimal impact on malaysia. hong leong investment bank in a june 24 report points out that malaysias trade with the uk amounted to only 1% of total exports while foreign direct investment from the uk in the 2008 to 2015 period averaged just 4% annually. hence, risk to malaysia emanates mainly from financial contagion. credit suisse in a recent note says only a handful of malaysian companies have significant exposure to the uk. indeed, only five companies in the fbm klci lost more than 2% of their market capitalisation last friday. out of the five, genting bhd, genting malaysia bhd and ytl corp bhd saw their shares decline 2.4% to 3.8%. the other two large caps are sapurakencana petroleum bhd and astro malaysia holdings bhd, which lost 4.3% and 3.8% of their market value respectively last friday. the increased market volatility we see today is due to the risk off sentiment, which dominates market sentiment following the brexit vote. as investors reverse their positions in risky assets and emerging markets, local bonds and equities and the ringgit will certainly be under selling pressure. meanwhile, we also saw the us and european stock index futures drop a few percentages, indicating that us and european shares are likely to fall when the markets open later, says areca capital ceo danny wong. that said, the selldown is just a knee-jerk reaction and is short term in nature. brexit would still require parliamentary approval and it could take up to two years to complete the process. positively, the odds of having two rate hikes this year are very low as the us fed turns more cautious on the outlook of the global economies. this is good news for emerging market equities, he adds. after the dust settles, investors will reassess the market situation and probably come back the asia  the only bright spot that offers decent growth in a low interest rate environment. the alternatives dont look attractive enough: us interest rates are too low while investors have largely turned more cautious towards european assets. therefore, the next couple of days could be a good time to capitalise on the brexit-induced share price weakness and accumulate blue-chip stocks such as tenaga nasional bhd or malayan banking bhd, wong concludes. the market turmoil is a natural flight to safety but its still too early to gauge the full impact. i think we have to wait and see how the us markets respond to brexit and how the asian markets respond to us shares on monday. so far, our local stock market has held up relatively well against its asian peers with the fbm klci still staying above 1,600. for instance, tokyo stock price index lost 8% and hang seng dropped 3% while fbm klci fell marginally by 0.4%. malaysian government securities saw yields rise but the amount was small, says etiqa insurance & takaful head of research chris eng. strategy-wise, watch the fbm klci on monday  after the us markets absorb the brexit news  on whether it can remain resilient and stay above 1,600. as the initial system shock from brexit subsides, and as the markets expect just one fed rate hike in 2016, i believe that the local stock market could gradually recover towards 4q. as such, if the index trades close to 1,600, its a pretty good entry point to accumulate stocks. however, if the index falls below 1,600, this will also set off another leg for a further fall, he adds. nonetheless, brexit is still a negative development for the global trade and economy. looking ahead, the further disintegration in the eu and the rise of populist politics are risks that investors need to watch out for. people shrugged off the possibility of rodrigo duterte becoming the president of the philippines, but it happened. then people thought that brexit was unlikely to materialise, but it happened. this november, we have the us presidential election and people dismiss the idea that populist candidate donald trump could be elected into office. if trump really becomes president of the us, this could have an adverse impact on global trades, economies and markets, eng concludes.  impact on sectors analysts do not expect brexit to directly impact malaysian banks as their exposure to the uk is very small. the uk-related loans of the largest bank, malayan banking bhd, amounted to rm1.27 billion as at end-march, or just 0.3% of total loans. cimb group holdings bhd, the second largest bank, had uk-related loans amounting to rm948 million, also just 0.3% of total loans. loans to the uk is really small, so i dont think therell be a direct impact. but there could be secondary effects, in that the banks may have exposure to companies that have high exposure to the uk, says a banking analyst with a local research brokerage. in a june 21 report, credit suisse notes a stronger british pound means higher ringgit revenue and profits (or vice versa), translated from the uk business units. ytl power international bhd leads the pack as some 24% of its revenue is derived from uk-based wessex water. the water and sewerage subsidiary in the uk contributes ~82% of ytl powers pre-tax earnings. this business will likely remain resilient after brexit. with over 40 casinos, genting malaysia is one of the largest casino operators in the uk. credit suisse estimates that genting malaysias uk operations will only contribute 2.5% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation in 2016e. genting is exposed to uk via its 49.3% stake in genting malaysia. the battersea power station project in the uk is owned by sime darby bhd and s p setia bhd (40% each), with the employees provident fund owning the remainder. a weaker economy will adversely affect the take-up in future property launches in the country. sime darbys property division will see associate profit contribution from battersea in the uk in fy2017. we estimate that battersea will make up about 11% of simes net profit. if the uk economy weakens, the worry is that future launches in battersea will be adversely impacted. the malaysian property market remains lacklustre, says credit suisse. the first phase is expected to be handed over progressively over a six-month period from december 2016 and the expected contribution to s p setias bottom line is about rm280 million, or 36% of consensus fy2017 estimates, it says. eco world development group bhd and eastern & oriental bhd have meaningful exposure to the uk as well. eco world international (ewi), in which the listed eco world will eventually hold a 30% stake upon its listing, has a huge exposure in the uk. as at january, ewi recorded u00a3712 million in property sales. e&o ventured to the uk in 2012 when it acquired princes house in central london. the project with an estimated gross development value of u00a360 million is slated for completion this year, in which revenue and profit will then be recognised. e&o recently aborted its proposal to list its uk-based property unit, e&o plc, on the london stock exchange. although the local bourses decline last friday was the smallest among the regions markets, the uncertainty over the global effects of brexit is likely to dampen investor sentiment in the coming weeks, until the dust settles and clarity emerges."}, "135":

shareholder of the battersea power station project, the government-linked conglomerate said the project will continue to generate interest in the longer term. the group is confident that the iconic development will continue to generate interest in the longer term and that london will continue to remain a key investment destination and financial centre. in an unprecedented move, uk voters polled for the country to leave the eu, with 52% or 17.41 million voters commanding the winning decision. a total of 48% or 16.14 million voters chose to stay in the eu. voter turnout was 72.16%. the

construction specialist kimlun corp bhd expects its earnings for the current financial year to either be the same or lower than last year, as most mega infrastructure projects in the country are still at early stages and not likely to contribute significantly to its earnings in the immediate- to near-term. due to the softening property market, the group also expects lower profit contribution from the group's property development. the segment contributed less than 10% to the group's earnings last year. the group's chief executive officer sim tian liang said the construction sector, which dominated about 80% of the group's revenue in fy15, will still be the main earnings growth driver this year. sim said the group, which has an order book of rm1.8 billion, is bidding for up to rm3 billion worth of projects. he said it is difficult to estimate as to how much the group can secure from the bids that it has submitted so far, though he shared that kimlun has a 20% win ratio. industrial gas and chemical delivery specialist kelington group bhds chairman and chief executive officer raymond gan said the group's revenue in the current financial year ending dec 31, 2016 (fy16)

group is also tendering for rm500 million worth of projects, from which it expects to secure 20% worth of jobs. among these projects, 40% is from the high-tech industry, while 60% is from the general

in line with berjaya corporation bhds (bcorp's) financial year end. bcorp took over redtone on may 8, 2016. redtone said that its losses were due to high project costs arising from prolonged delay in

4.95%, sime darby bhd went up 1.93%, public bank bhd has gained 1.75%, malayan banking bhd rose 5.83%, and nestle malaysia bhd is up 2.18%  in line with the constant influx of foreign funds. the benchmark fbm klci has gained over 100 points over the past few weeks, from touching levels around 1,600 in january, to close at 1,703.79 points last friday, indicating some steady buying support for index-linked counters. etiqa insurance & takaful head of research chris eng attributed the return of foreign funds to the strengthening ringgit, the poor performance of the fbm klci over the past two years and the gradual resolution of the 1malaysia development bhd (1mdb) issue. part of the return has been due to the strengthening ringgit, with hope for more strength, and the poor performance of the malaysian market over the last two years, with it being among the top three worst-performing regional markets in 2014 and 2015. the continued gradual resolution of the 1mdb issue, with the sale of

resolution of edra removed some overhang on the stock. m&a securities sdn bhd head of research rosnani rasul cited the improving outlook for the ringgit and oil prices as factors behind the return of foreign funds, which has supported recent gains in index-linked counters. the main choice of foreign funds has always been blue-chips, high liquidity and strong balance sheet counters, she said, adding that the foreign buying activity is expected to continue in the near term. according to midf researchs latest fund flow report, liquidity flow into the asian region remained elevated for the third consecutive week, with net foreign purchases for the malaysian bourse exceeding rm1 billion for the second week running, for the trading week ended march 18. it said foreign buyers purchased

which 64% were in equities. australia has an allocation of 5.2%, of which 29% was in equities and 56% in fixed income instruments. at 25% (rm171 billion) in 2015, the growth in the proportion of foreign assets to local assets has slowed year on year, from 23% (rm146 billion) in 2014. foreign assets accounted for 20% (about rm118 billion) of the epfs total assets in 2013, 17% (about rm90 billion) in 2012 and 13% (about rm61 billion) in 2011. but, just like the equities asset class, the epfs foreign assets accounted for a significantly higher portion of total earnings in 2015  a testament to its structured overseas investment programme, which it said formally started in 2006. overseas income was also higher in ringgit terms with the ringgit sharply lowere last year. despite making up only 25% of total investment size, foreign investments contributed 48% of the epfs total rm44.23 billion investment income in 2015, thus outperforming domestic assets, epf chairman tan sri samsudin osman said in the feb 20 statement. the epf is reportedly looking to increase its foreign assets to 27% over the coming two years to diversify its portfolio. it is worth noting, however, that the epfs foreign assets touched 27% as at end-september 2015. it is not immediately certain why foreign assets reduced from 3q2015 to 4q2015, but the change in the strength of the ringgit could be a factor. to the question of whether the epf faces constraints in diversifying overseas, given putrajayas recent instruction to repatriate foreign investments, the epf ceo reportedly said the government had never stopped the epf from acquiring overseas assets as it understood the need for diversification. another outperformer is the predictable income stream from the alternative investment class, namely the real estate and infrastructure asset class, which contributed rm1.7 billion in investment income in 2015, up 22.2% from 2014. this asset class  which includes foreign investments and was initiated in 2010, which the epf said showed encouraging performance  reportedly accounts for about 4% of total earnings, while making up 3% of total assets. the intent is to have this asset class make up about 8% to 10% of investments over the next three to five years. for investors interested in tracking the epfs equities investments, a quick comparison of its top 30 local stock investments found that it broadly increased its holdings in stocks whose prices ended lower year on year in 2015, except for media prima bhd, sime darby bhd and ijm plantations bhd, in which the provident fund reduced its exposure even as stock prices fell. similarly, the epf pared holdings in stocks whose prices ended higher year on year in 2015, except for public bank bhd, united plantations bhd, ijm corp bhd and dialog group bhd, in which it raised holdings year on year, even as share prices rose. it should be noted that an end-2014 to end-2015 holdings comparison only shows a year-on-year change in portfolio standings and is simplistic as it might not capture a change in buy or sell directions between the 12 months. put another way, the epf and its portfolio managers could have taken profit while share prices moved higher and bought shares again when prices fell. according to stock exchange filings, as at feb 24 this year, the epf was still buying united plantations and dialog while paring its exposure to sime darby and ijm plantations. it is also worth noting that purchases of bimb holdings bhd shares were among the largest year-on-year increases in shareholding by the epf among its top 30 domestic equity holdings. as at end-2015, the epf held 12.6% of bimb, up more than 3% from 9.49% at end-2014. the epfs stake in bimb rose further to 12.99% as at feb 22, stock exchange filings show. the epf also bought tenaga nasional bhd shares, which fell on fears of it overpaying for acquisitions as well as a surprise tax bill. other sizeable year-on-year increases in holdings in 2015 were banking stocks, including malayan banking bhd, where its shareholding went from 13.3% as at end-2014 to 17.06% at end-2015, but this had been reduced to 15.49% at the time of writing. the epf also raised its stake in cimb group holdings bhd from 14.65% as at end-2014 to 17.41% at end-2015 while it currently holds 16.92%. the epfs shareholding in ammb holdings bhd rose from 14.36% as at end-2014 to 16.45% at end-2015 and stood at 15.98% at the time of writing. [see table] meanwhile, a new addition to its top 30 holdings list last year was malakoff corp bhd, which had an initial public offering in may last year. the epf reduced its equity interest from 30% to 17.45% by offering part of its stake for sale. its shareholding was 18.83% as at end-2015 but had fallen to 17.5% at the time of writing. more importantly, 90% of the epfs top 30 investments paid some form of dividend in 2014 and at least 60% are likely to do the same for 2015. in 2014, total dividends from its top 30 holdings are estimated at rm3.2 billion. while the reporting season for 2015 was still ongoing at the time of writing, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that at least rm1.8 billion had been paid to the epf by those that have announced fy2015 dividends  a testament to the importance of yield to bolster ones portfolio.

february 29 - march 6, 2016.  the mood was somber in the ballroom of sime darby bhds convention centre in montkiara, where the diversified group released its half-year financial earnings. as president and group ceo tan sri mohd bakke salleh took his seat at the briefing, he hardly smiled. while profit before tax (pbt) fell 22% year on year [to rm463.5 million for the second quarter ended dec 31], turnover actually increased by 10% y-o-y [to rm11.83 billion]. this should tell you a lot about the environment we are operating in today, bakke told the press last wednesday. sime darby, which has grown enormously in size in the past decade, is likely to remain profitable in the current financial year ending june 30 (fy2016). but the cyclical downturn may hit it hard, despite its well diversified core businesses  plantations, industrial, automotive and property  with no reprieve in sight. a few quarters of weak earnings due to poor macroeconomic conditions arent just short-term problems for sime darby. the quarterly numbers might have exposed the groups vulnerability to the fluctuation of commodity prices. some quarters wonder what sime darby would look like if it hadnt gone on the acquisition trail. furthermore, the conglomerate usually surprises the investing fraternity with the premium prices it is willing to pay for acquisitions. young fund managers might not see sime darby as an exciting name or a must-have blue-chip that would enable their investment portfolios to outperform their peers. from a debt perspective [sime darbys sukuk, for example], glcs [government-linked companies] like sime darby are great because they are good paymasters. from an equities perspective, however, the appeal is harder to see. the group isnt good at realising the value of its assets, says one fund manager. if you want exposure to plantations, there are other plantation companies that dont have sime darbys issues. if you want exposure to property development, there are better developers out there that can give you more value. to top it off, sime darby doesnt look very cheap because its share price is well supported by its shareholders, he says. for the six-months ended dec 31, net profit fell 36% y-o-y to rm601.7 million, coming in below analysts expectations. revenue grew 5.4% y-o-y to rm22 billion. the timing and acquisition price of new britain palm oil ltd (nbpol) last year are debatable. some fund managers see it underscoring the conglomerates struggle to create value. that said, the rm6.07 billion nbpol acquisition did help to lift sime darbys revenue by adding 80,000ha of palm oil plantations in papua new guinea that are deemed to be prime assets. however, the plantation arm, which makes up 40% of pbt, still performed poorly overall due to low crude palm oil prices, poor weather and an export levy imposed by indonesia. even with a contribution of 749,000 tonnes of fresh fruit bunch production (ffb) from nbpol, pbt for the plantation segment fell 17.7% y-o-y to rm460.4 million. note that nbpols contribution made up about 14% of the groups total ffb production of 5.4 million tonnes during the period. the severe drought has reduced the contribution from nbpol, but overall, the synergy from the acquisition is positive. it is good for the companys long-term sustainability, says kenaga research analyst, voon yee ping. notably, the pbt includes rm101.5 million from the midstream and downstream operations for the period, compared with a loss of rm1 million in the previous year. in addition, exchange gains for the settlement of intercompany balances of rm50.7 million were recognised during the period. stripping out these items, the groups upstream plantation business actually saw a contraction of 44.8% in pbt to rm308.2 million. the groups diversified nature hasnt helped it to diversify earnings risks. with commodity prices at rock-bottom levels, prospects for sime darbys australia-based industrial segment continue to deteriorate. the slowdown in the property market isnt doing sime darby any favours either, and to top it off, automotive sales are expected contract for the first time in four years (see table above). weak earnings are putting pressure on the group to deleverage its balance sheet or risk a ratings downgrade. last year, rating agency moodys investors service had already revised the outlook on sime darbys a3 rating to negative because the a3 rating is not sustainable at four times leverage [debt/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda)], it wrote. moodys revision came after the nbpol acquisition, which has increased sime darbys gearing to 61%. the outlook is negative and could crystallise into a downgrade if substantial debt reduction fails to materialise in the next six months, such that adjusted debt/ebitda remains above 2.5 times, moodys writes. bakke is finding ways to address the ballooning debts. he hopes to monetise rm1.8 billion in assets at end-march and launch up to rm3 billion in perpetual sukuk by the middle of the year, in order to reduce the groups gearing to 54%. operationally, however, sime darby is pretty much in line with its peers of a similar size (see table 2). for the six-month period, sime darbys annualised ffb yield was slightly above 21 tonnes per hectare, well above the national average of 18 to 19 tonnes per hectare. still, bakke admits that there is room for improvement.  our yield is about one tonne less than some of our peers. that one tonne is a lot when you add it up. this is something that we are addressing through replanting, says bakke. while replanting will take many years to bear fruit, bakke has more pressing concerns. some analysts do not think the current monetisation plan to pare down borrowings will be sufficient. the rm1.8 billion asset monetisation is a start, but sime will need to do more. management has mentioned previously that it will look to monetise non-core businesses, as well as some of its property development landbank. tesco and the groups hospitality business could be some non-core assets to monetise, says one analyst. however, monetising assets to reduce its gearing isnt exactly a draw for investors. permodalan nasional bhd controls 48.7% of sime darby while the employees provident fund holds 12.7%. likewise, kenangas voon points out that sime darby will continue to be an important stock for funds to have their portfolios due to the sheer size of the groups assets. sime darby has the largest plantation landbank among malaysian planters and is the largest cpo producer following the acquisition of nbpol, she says. but sime darby cannot ride on its size forever. at some point, it will have to achieve its own tagline, developing sustainable futures.

hospitality asset hotel equatorial melaka for an estimated rm180 million, which would also involve assuming the hotels debt.  when contacted for details about the proposed disposal, sime darby property bhd acting managing director datuk ir jauhari hamidi tells the edge: sime darby property is open to business opportunities, including divestments that capture the desired value [which he does not reveal] of its portfolio. however, to date, we have not officially concluded any transaction on equatorial melaka. two weeks ago, sime darby president and ceo tan sri mohd bakke salleh told a press conference that the group was weighing several options to pare down its borrowings, including the possibility of monetising its assets. it intends to reduce its gearing level to 0.5 times from 0.6 times now. it is learnt that several interested parties have viewed the 18-year-old, 496-room hotel, which is located in bandar hilir melaka, not far from the popular historical sites of afamosa and the stadthuys. according to an executive in the hotel industry, the asking price for the leasehold asset is around rm180 million, of which rm100 million is for the property and the remaining rm80 million to assume the debt of syarikat malacca straits inn sdn bhd, which owns the hotel. sime darby (fundamental: 0.80; valuation: 1.40) holds the majority stake in syarikat malacca straits inn through wholly owned sime darby property. according to the conglomerates fy2015 annual report, sime darby propertys stake in syarikat malacca straits inn is 55%. however, a search on the companies commission of malaysia (ccm) website shows the stake to be 61.15%. perbadanan melaka holdings, which is wholly owned by perbadanan kemajuan negeri melaka, holds 22.17% equity interest in the asset while hotel equatorial (m) sdn bhd has 16.67%. the largest shareholder of hotel equatorial (m) is twintrees hotels sdn bhd. incidentally, hotel equatorial (m) is rebuilding hotel equatorial kuala lumpur in jalan sultan ismail, next to the kenanga international building. the hotel is making way for equatorial plaza, which will comprise a 52-storey block with a podium, office tower and hotel, and is expected to be ready in three years. in sime darbys annual report for its financial year ended june 30, 2015 (fy2015), the net book value of the 22-storey hotel equatorial melaka stands at rm81.4 million and the lease on the property expires between 2072 and 2075. according to filings with ccm, syarikat malacca straits inns revenue in fy2014 dropped to rm42.66 million from rm44.17 million in the previous year. net profit, however, was higher at rm7.09 million compared with rm6.94 million. since fy2010, the highest net profit achieved by hotel equatorial melaka was rm12.59 million in fy2012. total liabilities in fy2014 stood at rm85.19 million, of which rm10.36 millions worth were current, while accumulated losses amounted to rm20.36 million. in 2009, sime darby had appointed an exclusive agent to handle the sale of the hotel for around the same price. however, no deal was signed. it is unclear if the company has hired an agent this time around. hotel equatorial melaka has seen better days. it was built as a five-star hotel but has lost some of its edge over the years. in fact, the edge understands that in addition to the purchase price, the new owner would have to spend another rm25 million to rm50 million on refurbishment to upgrade the hotels facilities in order to maintain its five-star status.  the facilities are five-star but the condition is three-star, so it would need some rm50 million for refurbishment, says a hotel operator. other than the hotel in melaka, sime darbys hospitality properties include harvard golf & country club and hotel in kedah, darby park executive suites in singapore and karri valley resort in western australia. its hospitality involvement is also through its 21.8% stake, as at aug 6, in eastern & oriental

younger households who, for years, have seen property prices only move northwards. between 2009 and 2014, the malaysian house price index registered a compound annual growth rate (cagr) of 10.1%. it marked a period of sharp acceleration compared with 5.6% for the period between 2000 and 2014. this rapid growth in an otherwise sedate domestic property sector came on the back of ample liquidity that flooded the market following the global financial crisis in 2008. predictably, grumbles that houses were too expensive for the hardworking middle class emerged. the government attempted to halt this price growth by stopping free-flowing mortgages and stepping efforts to combat speculative activities as early as 2011. price growth slowed but it was not till 2015 that growth in residential property deals stalled. this year, property developers are struggling with sales. few are selling or building properties at rates seen during the housing boom and napic reported that property stock, which stood at 4.87 million units in 1q2015, grew to 4.89 million units in 2q2015. at the same time, new launches fell 12.8% in 1h2015 year on year while unsold units under construction rose a whopping 32.7%. these unsold residential units have started to subtly drive prices down. napics numbers indicate that as at 2q2015, the malaysian house price index was at 220.2 points, up 5.9% y-o-y. the rate of increase of the index has been slowing since 3q2015. house prices have definitely come down. if you dont see them, it is because property developers have started to offer rebates, discounts or other incentives like free legal fees or stamp duties, which will lower the amount you pay for the property in the end, says chang kim loong, secretary-general of the national house buyers association. if the additional supply is helping to moderate property prices, then some will find napics data on incoming supply comforting. it reported that malaysia had incoming supply of 795,372 residential properties in 1q2015, which increased to 831,186 in 2q2015. while private developers are more cautious about adding on to that, the government is not. based on the 11th malaysia plan, the government, through various housing programmes, targets to deliver 653,000 new housing units from 2016 to 2020. the sum excludes many state housing schemes. for the middle class in particular, the 1malaysia peoples housing (pr1ma) programme should be adding an extra half a million affordable homes by 2018. the bulk of the promised 500,000 units should enter the market in 2017 and 2018. lest we forget, there is also the governments directive to government-linked companies to build 800 units in bandar kwasa damansara and for sime darby property to build 4,600 units of affordable homes. also reassuring for aspiring homeowners is that those in the business of building homes are not expecting property prices to see a surge. they tell the edge that growth in house prices is likely to stagnate in the near term, as buyers looking for new properties and prepared for the added debt burden are denied owing to lending restrictions. bina puri holdings bhd executive director matthew tee says, i expect property prices to remain at current levels, with growth capped by the current regulatory environment. i dont see prices coming down too much because the cost of development is very high. land and other costs are still going up. ken holdings bhds sam tan says, the property development business is not as easy as it used to be. you have to offer more amenities, and provide connectivity and infrastructure to attract buyers. developers profit margins are thinning due to rising costs and slowing market. it depends on what you build and how you price your product. the bread-and-butter properties  those priced between rm300,000 and rm500,000  will still sell. but, generally speaking, you will not see a surge in prices anytime soon. so, are moderating residential property prices arising from an increase in supply the answer to the housing affordability woes of the middle class? midf research economist izzuddin yusuf doesnt believe that is the case. property prices have swelled too much over the last few years for a small tapering off to count. affordability is still an issue for most middle-income earners looking to live under their own roof. i think the idea of affordable housing has changed recently for the public, to a point that it is considered affordable so long as you are eligible for a bank loan.  property prices are currently at a level that is still unaffordable for real demand, meaning those who buy in order to live in the property, even as speculative buying has slowed significantly. from here, property prices will probably grow at a very slow pace and it will be a while before they become affordable for most first-time buyers, he says. indeed, khazanah research institutes (kri) study, making housing affordable, found that the the median price for the malaysian housing market exceeded the three times median annual household  the threshold for affordability. the general median price stood at4.4 times in 2014  a seriously unaffordable level. in cities like kuala lumpur and penang, residential properties were severely unaffordable. launches were priced way above the affordable threshold of rm274,320 for the capital city and rm168,272 for penang. implicit in kris statistics is that house prices  soaring or moderating  is not the only variable that determines if a middle-class household can afford to buy a property. it also has to do with income level and growth in disposable income. housing affordability is not simply about having cheaper houses u2026 for a house to be affordable, it means that the purchaser has the budget to pay for the home, says teh lip kim, managing director of selangor dredging bhd. ken holdings tan says, we try to build affordable homes and what is being sought after, but people still have to be able to buy them. people are now in a situation where banks are tightening lending requirements. [they also] have one or more banking loans to service and face a higher cost of living. to buy a property, you need the additional disposable income. while wages in malaysia are growing and the employment rate is good, they are not growing as fast as property prices. the higher your income, the more affordable a house will be to you. further, socially popular regulations that stifle property price growth may help quiet public complaints about housing affordability, but wont do more than that for the malaysian economy. not only does the construction sector contribute directly to the countrys gross domestic product (gdp) but it also has a strong multiplier effect. as it also affects sectors like finance, building materials, logistics, infrastructure development and job creation, it is unlikely that a prolonged sluggishness in property prices is what the government wants. rajiv biswas, chief economist at ihs, says, the construction sector in malaysia accounted for 4.3% of gdp in 2014, based on government data. therefore, the size of the sector is significant and any significant slowdown would act as a drag on gdp growth. therefore, if the private sector residential construction sector experiences a downturn, the overall impact on total construction activity could be reduced by stronger public sector spending on affordable housing and public infrastructure projects. but even as growth in home prices is losing steam, the dream of home ownership may still remain elusive to the middle class."}, "163": {"date_posted": "25/11/2015", "title": "trade wise: jcorps takeover of kulim likely to be successful", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on november 9 - november 15, 2015.  judging from the initial euphoria over johor corp bhds offer to privatise its plantation arm, kulim (m) bhd, the exercise should get the nod from shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting slated to be convened later. last friday, kulims shares gained 57 sen, or 17.3%, to close at rm3.87, which marks its highest close since the late 1980s. kulims warrants surged 29.5 sen to close at rm1 last friday.  to recap, johor corp (jcorp), johors investment arm, and parties acting in concert are looking to privatise kulim (fundamental: 2.60; valuation: 3) via a selective capital reduction and repayment exercise of rm4.10 per share. the proposed selective capital reduction is also extended to holders of kulims warrants and individuals in employee share option schemes who converted their warrants and options into shares prior to the entitlement period. according to kulims annual report, as at mid-april this year, there were 76.3 million warrants that had yet to be converted from the 156.2 million issued at end-february 2011. the warrants initially had a strike price of rm3.13, but this was later adjusted to rm2.77 after kulim paid a special dividend of 37.6 sen. the warrants mature at end-february next year.  to succeed, the privatisation exercise requires the approval of 50% of shareholders in number and 75% in value of the votes, and must not be rejected by more than 10% in value of the votes. considering kulims share base is about 1.2 billion and jcorp has about 755.2 million shares, it would have to fork out rm1.9 billion to buy the shares it does not own,excluding the warrants. as at mid-april this year, jcorp had almost 21.3 million warrants or close to 27.9% of the derivatives issued. the number of warrants jcorp holds now is not clear.  judging by comments from analysts and other market watchers, the deal seems to be a good one for kulims minority shareholders. for starters, considering kulims net assets per share as at end-june this year stood at rm3.74, the offer seems to be an attractive one. it is also noteworthy that jcorp and parties acting in concert hold 755.2 million shares or almost 61.9% of kulim and as at mid-april this year, kulim had only one substantial shareholder other than jcorp, namely kumpulan wang persaraan (diperbadankan) (kwap), with 6.8% equity interest. to put things in perspective, kwap surfaced as a substantial shareholder in kulim in mid-april this year, when the stock was trading at an average of rm2.65, which makes it unlikely that the pension fund will create a fuss over the rm4.10 price tag per kulim share.  also, a market watcher points out that the offer comes at a time when crude palm oil (cpo) prices are depressed, and there is much uncertainty in the market. last friday, cpo futures traded at rm2,380 per tonne, down some 40% from just below rm4,000 per tonne in february 2011. while cpo prices have been picking up, there is still considerable uncertainty u2026 so minority shareholders of kulim may want to lock in this profit, he says. rhb research institute says jcorps attempt [to privatise kulim] is likely to succeed, given that kulims share price would unlikely reach that level (rm4.10) otherwise. we view the privatisation offer price as generous, being 9.6% above [rhb researchs] target price [of rm3.74] and factoring in the second tranche of its special dividend from the sale of new britain palm oil ltd [nbpol]. excluding the dividend, the offer is 24% above its last closing price. while rhb research cites catalysts for kulims share price and potential value boosters to include a potentially valuable oil find in its oil exploration venture, steady improvement in its palm oil yield, given that its age profile is now at its best ever and even microsoft setting up operations in sedenak, johor, where kulim has 4,554ha of land, it goes on to say that none of these are likely to push kulims stock price to rm4.10 over the next 12 months. another stand-alone brokerage sees the privatisation exercise as a huge windfall for minority shareholders. for its first six months ended june, kulim registered a net profit of almost rm1.4 billion on revenue of rm779.6 million. in its announcements, kulim said it recorded a gain on disposal of some rm1.3 billion from sales, including that of nbpol to sime darby bhd. as at end-june, kulim had cash and cash equivalents of rm1.7 billion, and on the other side of the balance sheet, the plantation company had short-term borrowings of rm606.8 million and long-term debt commitments of rm235.2 million.  to recap, in october 2014, plantation giant sime darby made a cash offer of u00a37.15 per share for all shares in nbpol and completed the rm6 billion deal at end-february this year, with kulim receiving u00a3525.4 million, or over rm2.7 billion, from the disposal of its stake in nbpol. thus, it is likely that much of the funds for the selected capital repayment are from sime darby.  despite the jump in kulims share price, those left out of the euphoria still stand to gain 5% if they jump on the bandwagon, based on its closing price of rm3.87 last friday."}, "164": {"date_posted": "24/11/2015", "title": "over 5% of e&o

"}, "172": {"date_posted": "11/9/2015", "title": "sime darby weighs options to pare debts", "article": "    \nagainst a backdrop of weak commodity prices and a challenging business environment, sime darby bhd saw its earnings weaken for its financial year ended june 30, 2015 (fy2015), and how it will address its rm18 billion debt remains unclear. the conglomerate is committed to strengthening its balance sheet  which saw net gearing balloon to 58% from 38% after the acquisition of new britain palm oil ltd (nbpol) in march  but has no concrete plans yet on how it will do it. we have not come up with a plan yet, it is still a work in progress. but definitely, we are working on strengthening our balance sheet, tan sri mohd bakke salleh, sime darbys president and group chief executive, said at a press briefing after the release of its quarterly financial results last wednesday. the intention is to come up with a gearing ratio that is a bit more palatable for ourselves and our stakeholders. if we can bring it to anywhere between 30% and 35%, that would be a lot more desirable, bakke remarked. but he also noted that given the cheaper cost of debt compared to equity, it makes sense to borrow at this point in time. bakke added that sime darby (fundamental: 0.80; valuation: 1.40) would also consider merger and acquisition opportunities to expand its footprint. everything we are encountering today is not all doom and gloom. even in bad times, there will be opportunities to pick up assets or enter into strategic collaborations with other players in the market. we have been receiving many offers from such players to partner or buy over their assets, he said. asked later by digitaledge weekly if it would consider gearing up further to fund potential m&a, sime darby declined to respond. a company spokesperson instead said sime darby hopes to achieve its target of 30% to 35% gearing in the short to medium term. analysts estimate that this could be done in six to nine months. there has been market talk recently that the group is considering a rm6 billion rights issue to pare down its debts, but sime darby has not confirmed or denied this. analysts tracking the stock, however, believe that a cash call may not be sime darbys best option as it would enlarge its share base and dilute earnings. it would depend on how the rights issue is priced for investors. unless sime darby can immediately buy something that is earnings accretive, would shareholders want to fork out the extra cash? asks cimb researchs regional analyst ivy ng. it does not seem critical for it to buy more assets at this point. but if the offers coming to it look increasingly interesting, then the rights issue might be an option to consider if it offsets the dilution effect, she says. in that vein, others point out that sime darby will have to hold off any major acquisitions until it has reduced its debt level. it is highly likely that until it deleverages sufficiently, it might not do another acquisition, or do a combination of debt and equity to maintain gearing at current levels, or even bring down debt, fitch ratings director of corporate ratings nandini vijayaraghavan tells digitaledge weekly. sime darby historically is always looking for m&a, but it is careful and most [of the] acquisitions it has made have been value accretive, she adds. in march, fitch ratings downgraded sime darbys outlook to negative after imputing debts from the nbpol buy. sime darbys ffo (funds from operations)-adjusted net leverage has risen to 2.5 times, well above the 1.75 times level at which fitch would consider negative rating action. interestingly, one analyst notes that sime darbys current gearing level is not untowardly high. the negative rating by fitch is the bigger concern because that will impact sime darbys cost of borrowing, he says. bakke had said at the briefing, we need to respond to what credit rating agencies are looking for. according to alliance research, sime darbys borrowing cost is currently 3.4% per annum. that said, sime darby may not have to actively borrow more or make a cash call if business operations improve and cash flow rises. as at june30, sime darby had cash of rm3.65 billion, giving it a net debt of rm14.4 billion. but earnings have taken a hit for fy2015 with net profit falling 31.3% year on year to rm2.3 million on flat revenue of rm43.7 million. profit before interest and tax from its biggest income earner, the plantation division, fell 39% y-o-y to rm1.15 billion as average crude palm oil (cpo) prices dropped 11% to rm2,193 per tonne. its fresh fruit bunch (ffb) production for the year also fell 5% to nine million tonnes. quarterly net profit slipped 17% to rm988.67 million for the fourth financial quarter ended june 30 (4qfy2015), from rm1.19 billion in the previous corresponding period. revenue was marginally higher at rm12.86 billion against rm12.56 billion previously. the board has declared a lower dividend of 19 sen per share for 4qfy2015, bringing the total annual dividend to 25 sen per share for fy2015, compared with 30 sen in the previous corresponding quarter and 36 sen for fy2014. the difficult operating environment has prompted many analysts to cut their target price: alliance research to rm7.40, cimb research to rm8.08, affinhwang capital research to rm7.59 and amresearch to rm8. if cpo prices start to perk up or cash flow from its businesses starts to improve, then leverage is likely to moderate and they might not need to take on any major fundraising, but it is still too early to tell at this juncture, says fitchs nandini. in an aug 27 note, she writes, robust cpo and other vegetable oils output will continue to pressurise the cpo price in the short to medium term. an el nino is expected to occur in 2h15, while the resultant adverse impact on ffb yield and output will not be immediate. cpo prices are still at a level sufficient for the large players to cover their costs and generate adequate operating cash flow. the credit profiles of even the large cpo operators would deteriorate should prices stagnate at the current levels or decline further. spot cpo prices fell as low as about rm1,860 per tonne in the middle of last week, over 9% lower than in the week before, according to data by the malaysian palm oil council. spot cpo closed at rm1,994 last friday while the benchmark three-month futures ended the week at rm1,802. sime darby is bearish on the cpo price, forecasting the commodity to trade between rm1,900 and rm2,000 per tonne up to end-september. beyond that, its difficult to predict because of the uncertain outlook, said bakke. the groups silver lining would be the added earnings from nbpol, which has already begun contributing to the group. for fy2015, it has raked in rm102.6 million in profit before interest and tax. nbpols palm trees are about 10 years and have brought sime darbys average tree profile down to 14 years. one analyst says that given its fairly young age profile, sime darby is in a fairly good position to weather low cpo prices. in the meantime, apart from more borrowings or a rights issue, sime darby is also considering unlocking value by divesting some non-core assets  a strategy it has had in place for some time now. analysts concur that monetising assets such as land parcels and its 30% stake in tesco is the best option for now. in fy2015, sime darby said that tesco was the main contributor in its others division, making a loss before interest and tax of rm35.8 million compared with a rm52.7 million profit the year before. this was due to a one-off impairment on property, plant and equipment and stocks, in which sime darbys share was rm89.2 million. most recently, sime darby sold off its 50% interest in sime darby sunsuria development sdn bhd for rm173.4 million and a 9.9% stake in eastern & oriental bhd for a total of rm319 million. but the difficulty in the current weak market would be finding a buyer, and sime darby has been burnt before. the group, which distributes bmw, hyundai and ford cars, has put on hold indefinitely the planned listing of its motor division that was initially slated for 2hfy2015. the initial public offering had been estimated to raise some rm2 billion but is now deferred until the market is conducive for the exercise. in fy2015, the motor divisions profit before interest and tax fell 25% y-o-y to rm473.6 million on lower earnings in all regions except for australia, new zealand and vietnam. sime darby said that the divisions sales in malaysia were affected by tighter lending rules, the goods and services tax, and the depreciating ringgit.   note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance

the indexs support levels are seen at the 1,503, 1,567 and 1,614 levels, while very heavy selling at the resistance areas of 1,620, 1,660 and 1,685 will cap any index rebound. the medium-term downside targets for the index may still remain at 1,448 and 1,414. the fbm klcis 18-day and 40-day simple moving averages (sma) depict a mild sideways trend for its short-term daily chart whilst the 50-day and 200-day sma have intersected with a death cross as well. therefore, this will not augur well for the index in the medium to longer term. furthermore, the fbm klci had broken a very critical neckline support of a major head and shoulder pattern on aug 10, 2015. the implied target of such a breakdown pitches the medium-term downside target at 1,448 despite its current minor rebound phase that began on aug 25, 2015 from the 1,503.68 low. due to the volatile tone for the fbm klci index, we are recommending a chart sell on sime darby bhd. a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that 26 research houses cover the stock, with three buy calls, 17 hold calls and six sell calls. maybank investment bank bhds analyst has a hold call on sime darby despite its 4qfy6/15 core net profit of rm1 billion coming out above expectations at 114% of his forecast. the fy6/15 results were weaker year-on-year due to weaker crude palm oil average selling prices and lower fresh fruit bunches output, declining australasia industrial contributions as well as margin compression from its malaysia, hong kong and china motors segment. he maintained sime darbys target price at rm7.98, based on 18 times financial year 2017 price-earnings ratio. sime darby currently trades at a high historical per of 19.1 times. its price-to-book value ratio of 1.47 times indicates that its share price is trading at a minor premium to its book value. sime darbys chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly down. its share price made an obvious plunge since its major weekly wave-5 high of rm9.60 in january 2015. since that rm9.60 high, sime darby has tumbled to its august 2015 recent low of rm6.70. as prices broke above its recent key critical support levels of rm7.95 and rm8.26, look to sell sime darby on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to medium-term downtrend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) have issued clear sell signals and now depict firm indications of sime darbys eventual plunge towards lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the

sell cars to the younger generation. there is a growing number of mazda cars in the malaysian market now. we want to attract a new generation of buyers, the premium customers. youngsters today are different. they want a stylish car with the latest technology, he comments. berjaya auto aims to grow its malaysian sales by 20% per annum in the next three years, says lee. the group expects to register a profit growth of 10% in fy2016 on the back of 20% revenue growth. lee adds that berjaya auto plans to sell 16,000 mazda vehicles in malaysia in fy2016, compared with 12,209 units sold in fy2015. the higher sales will be driven by the all-new mazda 2 completely built-up (cbu) model imported from thailand, as well as the mazda 3 and cx-5, which are completely knocked-down (ckd) models assembled at inokom corp sdn bhds plant in kulim, kedah. the three bread-and-butter car models are expected to contribute 75% to berjaya autos sales. currently, the company has more than 10 cbu models in its portfolio but only two ckd models. the group has delayed the launch of the mazda 6 ckd model as it is not expected to be a high-volume driver. the next ckd model will either be the mazda 6 or cx-3. it could happen in the middle of next year, but nothing is firmed up yet. mazda 6 is not in thailand yet, so our principal wants us to build and export it to thailand, says lee. out of the 12,209 units sold in fy2015, 7,552 or 62% were cbu models. lee says ckd models will be the main sales driver in fy2016 with 60%, thanks to the full-year contribution of the locally assembled mazda 3. lee says berjaya auto will launch the new japanese-made cx-3 in november and plans to sell 80 to 100 units each month. it will move on to the ckd project for the model in the second half of 2016. berjaya auto will also launch the diesel variant of mazda 2, a cbu model imported from thailand, in november before it brings in the new mazda 6 and cx-5 (both with a 2.2-litre turbo diesel engine) by end-april next year. with a line-up of new mazda cars, lee says, berjaya auto aims to double its market share in the non-national car segment to 7% to 8%, which translates into 22,000 to 23,000 units a year. however, he clarifies that the group has no plans to grow sales to as big as that of honda, toyota and nissan.  this is a volume that we are very comfortable with, thats all we want to do. we might stretch ourselves if we do anything more than that. our profit margin could be affected if we give discounts to clear stock, says lee. he explains that the more a car maker produces, the cheaper the cars might have to be. this is because discounts will have to be given to clear stock if it is stuck with a depreciating inventory, on top of holding cost. two years after listing, we are still growing from a small base and its easier to gain market share in the non-national car segment. as long as the returns to shareholders are there, and the risk is mitigated, we are happy with our volume. we would rather grow slowly and steadily every year, says lee. he adds that berjaya auto, which maintains a healthy balance sheet, is committed to pay out at least 50% of its net profit as dividends in the coming years, although there is no such dividend policy in place. as at april 30, the company was sitting on a net cash position of rm280.8 million. this is a cash-rich, debt-free and asset-light company. we want to keep it this way. if the company doesnt need the cash (for expansion), we will pay [it] out as dividends. so, you may say that berjaya auto is a combination of growth stock and dividend play, lee says. berjaya auto, which has no plans to undertake any major m&a activity, might purchase a 5% stake in inokom from berjaya corp, raising its stake to 29%. inokom corp is a consortium that produces 23,000 mazda cars every year. its other shareholders are sime darby motors sdn bhd (51%), hyundai motor co of south korea (15%), sime darby hyundai sdn bhd (5%) and berjaya corp (5%). if berjaya auto can establish itself as a company that delivers both consistent earnings growth and steady dividends, it would not be short of investors in the long run. note: the edge

sime darby bhd, whose earnings were hit hard by weak commodity prices, is exploring options to pare down its borrowings as its debt-to-equity ratio swelled to 58% after the acquisition of new britain palm oil ltd (nbpol) in march.  we have not come up with a plan yet, it is still a work in progress. but definitely we are working on strengthening our balance sheet. the intention is to come up with a gearing ratio that is a bit more palatable for ourselves and our stakeholders, said the conglomerates president and group chief executive tan sri mohd bakke salleh at a press briefing after the release of its quarterly financial results. currently our gearing ratio is 58% as at june 30, only before then it was 38%, before the acquisition of nbpol. if we can bring it to anywhere between 30% and 35%, that would be a lot more desirable, he explained. the group yesterday announced lower quarterly and annual earnings as the weak crude palm oil (cpo) and coal prices had taken a toll on its profits. sime darbys net profit slipped 17% to rm988.67 million for the fourth financial quarter ended june 30 (4qfy15), from rm1.19 billion in the previous corresponding period. revenue, however, was higher at rm12.86 billion against rm12.56 billion previously. its annual net profit fell sharper in the financial year ended june 30, 2015 (fy15), down 31% to rm2.31 billion from rm3.35 billion in the previous year. revenue was marginally lower at rm43.7 billion versus rm43.9 billion the year before. the board has declared lower dividend of 19 sen per share for 4qfy15, bringing the total annual dividend to 25 sen per share for fy15, compared with 30 sen in the previous corresponding quarter and 36 sen for fy14. mohd bakke holds a bearish outlook on cpo prices, anticipating the edible oil to trade between rm1,900 and rm2,000 per tonne up to end-september. beyond that (end-september), its difficult to predict, because of the uncertain outlook, he added. he said the weakness in cpo prices had impacted the performance of sime darbys plantation division, as prices averaged lower during the quarter at rm2,242 per tonne. the groups industrial division registered a sharp decline in profit by 48.5%, due to the weak results in the australasia region which shrank by 62%, no thanks to the slump in coal prices and major mining companies slashing capital expenditure and deferring scheduled maintenance because of slump in coal prices. asked if the group is looking to expand its operations, mohd bakke said if there are any opportunities for synergistic mergers and acquisitions, sime darby will consider them. its not all doom and gloom currently, even in bad times, there will be opportunities to pick up new assets or to enter into strategic collaborations with other players, he said. anything that complements sime darbys five core businesses would be considered, he added. sime darbys share price has fallen from the years peak of rm9.50 in february to a low of rm7.02 on monday. the stock rebounded yesterday to go up 33 sen or 4.6% to rm7.45, bringing its market capitalisation to rm44.22 billion.  this article first appeared in digitaledge daily, on august 27, 2015."}, "177":

[access to] hundreds of millions of indonesian consumers u2026 thats what people did not see. now, we will be able to supply our margarine, cooking oil and fats. number two, we go there to look at not only our palm oil value chain but also our sugar business potential. there is just one lingering issue. the rajawali group is said to be politically linked. would this be an impediment? let me be honest. when i first took a look at the rajawali group, i was not aware of this political thing. i looked at it purely on its commercial value, and my team is still looking at it on that basis. we are not interested in the political context of it. after eagle high, would you still be pursuing more acquisitions? in the current context, i will not. i will look into the whole value chain of our oleochemicals after this, from downstream to upstream. so, we will consolidate all our investments and see where we want to grow. there is continuing speculation about your position as chief executive, and your contract ends in july. do you feel that you have done everything you intended to do during your time at fgv? i just want to say that we work as a team at fgv. whether im there or not, the entire team is focused on executing the strategic blueprint that we have. there is an ongoing discussion between me and the board as to the status of my contract. we will see.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on june 22 - 28, 2015."}, "182": {"date_posted": "7/7/2015", "title": "hb global, airasia, yinson, tmc life sciences, icapital.biz, sunway, aeon, sime darby, hartalega and bina darulaman", "article": " kuala lumpur (july 7): based on corporate announcements and news flow today, the companies that may be in focus tomorrow (wednesday, july 8) could be the following: hb global, airasia, yinson, tmc life sciences, icapital.biz, sunway, aeon, sime darby, hartalega and bina darulaman. frozen food specialist hb global ltd said in a reply to bursa malaysia this evening that it is still investigating the reason for its rise in share price and it is not aware of any unannounced corporate development or rumour on the rise of its share price. however, the company said it is still waiting for the reply from the major shareholders on the above matters. hb global has received an unusual market activity (uma) query from bursa malaysia earlier today, after its share price spiked in recent days. it closed 4.5 sen or 47.37% higher at 14 sen today, with some 5.7 million shares done. last week, hb global shares rose from 4.5 sen on monday, to close at six sen on friday. airasia bhd confirms that its 49%-owned associate company, pt indonesia airasia, has received a letter from indonesias ministry of transport that requires it to ensure a positive equity position by july 31. as this is a matter which has only been made known to us, we together with indonesia airasia are currently studying the letter closely as well as [seeking] a meeting with the ministry of transport, said the low cost carrier in a filing to bursa malaysia. airasia (fundamental: 0.2;

valuation: 1.40) is exploring the possibility of redeveloping the low-rise office building into a high-rise block called media prima tower. should mcil and media prima combine and package their parcels in jalan riong, the potential value for both parties would be higher than if they sell them separately, says an industry source. the net book value of mcils land and buildings stood at us$64.5 million (rm240.9 million) as at march 31, 2015, down from us$74.5 million a year earlier, mainly due to currency conversion difference and annual depreciation charges, management says. these properties will continue to be used by mcil in its newspaper publishing and printing operations worldwide, it adds. meanwhile, sources tell the edge that ancom bhd  the parent company of redberry media group  is also considering developing a 1.31ha tract in section 13, petaling jaya, where its media business is located. the leasehold land, which is owned by ancom (fundamental: 0.55; valuation: 1.20), had a net book value of rm28.8 million as at may 31, 2014. as it is housing low-rise office and factory buildings, its yield is low. coming up just behind the tract is the centrestage project  an integrated development comprising shoplexes, designer and serviced suites and a hotel. the group is exploring a few schemes to unlock the value of the land, and one of them is to work with a property developer. for centrestage, the initial price was about rm400 psf. today, the price of new projects in the vicinity is more than rm600 psf, says a source familiar with the matter. now, it is about timing as well as deciding on the right route to take. a sales agent with another nearby project known as pj midtown says its serviced apartments are priced at rm860 psf and scheduled for completion in 2018. the development, undertaken by ioi properties group bhd and sime darby brunsfield, is a stones throw from centrestage and a five-minute drive from the ancom tract. pj midtown will feature serviced apartments, offices and shophouses. it is worth noting that star media group bhd (fundamental: 2.50; valuation: 1.40) had taken such a path in 2011 when it sold a six-acre parcel that previously housed the groups office in section 13, petaling jaya, to jaks island circle sdn bhd. as part of the deal, star media group will also get a 13-storey office building with a built-up of 270,000 sq ft, to be called star tower. analysts say it makes sense for media players to look at unlocking the value of their land. some of the parcels they are sitting on are in prime locations. they should consider monetising them. after all, from a media operation standpoint, the industry is facing an uphill battle, and this is reflected in the decline in earnings, says an analyst with a bank. mcil, which publishes the top four chinese newspapers in the country, saw its revenue and net profit drop 8.4% and 36.9% year on year to us$429.1 million and us$31.1 million respectively in the financial year ended march 31, 2015. the decrease in earnings was attributed to the recognition of an impairment loss of goodwill and an allowance for impairment loss of interest in an associate, totalling over us$7 million. analysts say the decline was cushioned by lower newsprint costs and savings from the groups ongoing stringent cost management. apart from malaysia, mcil has printing and publishing businesses in hong kong, china and north america. amresearch, in a may 29 report on mcil, says it expects earnings to remain flat in the coming quarters in view of a challenging economic outlook, particularly in malaysia, which implemented the goods and services tax in april. it adds that on a positive note, mcils lean operating structure and cost-saving initiatives are beginning to show results. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers. a score of 3 suggests strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. visit www.theedgemarkets.com for more details on a companys financial dashboard. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on june 15 - 21, 2015. "}, "184": {"date_posted": "26/6/2015", "title": "earnings rebound unlikely for cpo players", "article": " although the price of crude palm oil (cpo) has largely stabilised at around rm2,200 per tonne over the past six months, the earnings of plantation companies have continued to weaken, as reflected in the latest results season. a key concern now is that despite a slew of bullish catalysts on the horizon, such as el niu00f1o and indonesias b15 implementation, major plantation players remain encumbered by lower operating margins as well as high unrealised foreign exchange losses. weaker average selling prices and lower fresh fruit bunch (ffb) output in the first quarter of the year resulted in a major earnings decline among the upstream players. apart from the decline in revenue, the lower ffb output has also dented operating margins, as millers were underutilised following floods in the east coast states late last year. rabobank international director of food and agribusiness research pawan kumar says the earnings outlook for plantation firms remains bleak for the rest of the year. we forecast both production and cpo prices to remain weak in the second quarter. existing negative fundamentals will hit the pure players the hardest. but the integrated players are better capitalised and can actively pursue income diversification. those with downstream exposure in indonesia have an added advantage, he says. this will put the spotlight on companies such as singapore-listed wilmar international ltd and golden agri-resources ltd, which are large integrated players with substantial downstream operations in indonesia. the indonesian government has big plans to support domestic palm oil consumption, including its push for the implementation of the b15 biodiesel mandate as well as export levies of us$50 per tonne for cpo and us$30 per tonne for processed palm oil products. the two initiatives will stoke up domestic demand in indonesia, which in turn will help the refiners that are currently operating at well below capacity. the proposed levies will go towards subsidising its biodiesel industry, incentivising plantation companies to ramp up production. in the near term, we prefer integrated players that are able to enjoy the margin difference on the levy of us$20 per tonne between upstream and downstream products, says cimb research analyst maureen natasha in a may research note. wilmar (fundamental: 0.80; valuation: 1.00) owns two biodiesel plants in indonesia with a combined capacity of two million kilolitres per annum. similarly, golden agri-resources (fundamental: 0.55; valuation: 1.20) has committed up to us$300 million to expand its downstream operations in indonesia. jakarta-listed integrated players such as pt astra agro lestari tbk and pt salim ivomas pratama tbk are also expected to benefit, as palm oil exports form only a small proportion of their total sales. malaysian integrated players look set to continue to be affected by weaker upstream contributions and lack of government support in the downstream segment. with no direct subsidies, unlike in indonesia, refiners continue to operate well below capacity and post losses due to negative refining margins. the reliance on contributions from the upstream segment was reflected in the recent results for the quarter ended march 31, which seemed to have underwhelmed analysts consensus expectations. for example, sime darby bhds plantations division saw its gross profit decline 7.8% y-o-y to rm99.6 million for the quarter ended march 31, 2015, due to low production and weak selling prices. profit at its midstream and downstream operations fell 55.3% to rm30.3 million from rm67.8 million a year ago. the lower profit was attributable to lower off-take of biodiesel from petroleum companies due to the drop in crude oil prices and lower sales volume of differentiated products, sime darby (fundamental: 0.80; valuation: 1.40) says in notes to its financial statements. major players such as felda global ventures bhd (fgv) and genting plantations bhd saw double-digit percentage declines in their ffb production on an annual basis, which affected their gross incomes. for 1qfy2015, fgv (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 1.40) reported a 38% drop in gross profit to rm363.1 million year-on-year while genting plantations (fundamental: 1.20; valuation: 1.10) saw its gross profit fall 25% y-o-y to rm115.1 million. however, even gross profits are being diluted from the companies foreign exchange exposure, as has been the case over the past year. the ringgit and rupiah have plummeted to new multi-year lows. it is not just a question of compressed margins anymore. unrealised forex losses are a long-term burden as we do not see any recovery for asian currencies against the us dollar. while unseasonable weather can bring down production from record high levels, regional and global demand for palm oil is still the key determinant of prices, says a plantations analyst at a bank-backed research house. the forex exposure of some of the integrated players has impacted their net income. for example, ioi corp bhd (fundamental: 1.20; valuation: 1.10) reported a net loss of rm188 million on the back of unrealised forex losses of rm333 million. similarly, ijm plantations bhd (fundamental: 1.60; valuation: 0.80) saw its net profit dwindle to rm10 million in its latest quarterly results, largely due to unrealised forex losses of rm51.36 million. rabobanks kumar says a silver lining for the upstream players would be the growth in indias demand for palm oil. imports should continue to pick up this year mainly because there is not a lot of domestic supply in india. an expected widening of the spread between soy oil and palm oil prices will also be supportive of the latter, as edible oil consumers will become more price sensitive. weak demand for palm oil this year has resulted in a growing stockpile, despite the bump in exports seen recently. according to malaysian palm oil board data, the closing stock of crude and processed palm oil in malaysia amounted to 2.19 million tonnes, not far from the all-time high of 2.62 million tonnes recorded in 2013. the government has decided to keep export tax at zero until the end of june in a bid to clear existing stock. the bullish catalysts, while good for investor sentiment, is unlikely to have an impact on cpos fundamentals anytime soon, at least until the current stockpile can be meaningfully reduced. according to anglo-eastern plantations plc executive director of finance datuk lim ewe chuan, this is the main factor that influences the industrys future prospects. in the near term, any upside on the cpo price may be limited in view of seasonally higher production and large stockpiles, he says.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on june 1 - 7, 2015."}, "185": {"date_posted": "5/6/2015", "title": "tanjung offshore, malakoff, genting plantations, mclean, sime darby, tune insurance, xian leng, biosis and golden land", "article": " kuala lumpur (june 5): based on corporate announcements and news flow today, the companies that may be in focus next week (monday, jun 8) could be: tanjung offshore, malakoff, genting plantations, mclean, sime darby, tune insurance, xian leng, biosis and golden land. a forensic audit on tanjung offshore bhd reveals the company has taken shortcuts and a sequence of shortcomings that had given way to corporate weakness. in statement today, the oil and gas engineering firm said it will lodge official complaints to the malaysian anti-corruption commission (macc) on the companys purchase of a 49% equity interest or 2.35 million shares in gastec gas genertors (m) sdn bhd in 2013 for rm34.3 million, as well as its acquisition of a property in birmingham, uk, for rm62.7 million. tanjung offshore (fundamental: 1.85;

fourth quarter of this year. we bought the land at a good price, so we can do something like this (farmstead) u2026 the selling point is that it will be an eco-friendly development located just about an hour out of kuala lumpur, says bina puri executive director matthew tee kai woon. in february, bina puri announced the acquisition of some 1,600 acres in bentong for rm47.5 million, which works out to less than rm30,000 an acre. according to tee, a river flows through the area, so bina puri merely has to make diversions to ensure that more of the land is beautified and more owners have access to the river. this is something different. we are not putting all our eggs in one basket. not all developments have to be in iskandar malaysia, johor, or in kuala lumpur, he remarks. according to bina puris announcement to bursa malaysia, the gross development value of the land is rm279 million and the purchase consideration was funded by a combination of internally generated funds and bank borrowings of rm38 million. it was also announced that bina puris gearing will increase to almost 3.2 from just below 3 times now. as at end-december last year, bina puri had cash and bank balances of rm61.1 million and deposits with licensed banks of rm10.8 million. on the other side of the balance sheet, the company had short-term borrowings of rm409.9 million and long-term debt commitments of rm208.7 million. it is also noteworthy that bina puri will take on an additional rm38 million in borrowings for the acquisition of the 1,600 acres.  for the year ended dec 31, 2014, bina puri paid rm15.5 million in finance costs, in contrast to its net profits, which was rm6.1 million on the back of almost rm1.1 billion in revenue. given its high gearing, bina puri has been raising capital via a private placement of 37.4 million new shares or 20% of its enlarged issued and paid-up share capital. this followed a reduction in its issued and paid-up capital via the cancellation of 50 sen of the par value of rm1 shares in december last year. earlier this month, a third tranche of almost 4.3 million shares was issued at 51.5 sen apiece. the first tranche of almost 7.5 million shares was issued at 50 sen in early january and another tranche of 15 million shares at 50.5 sen was issued at the end of february. tee is not worried about the high gearing, saying that the company already has strategic investors for the farmstead project, which is a long-term play. like in all our developments, we have strategic investors in place. the only thing we have to do is build some of the infrastructure  ensure there is water and electricity. the main access roads are already built, he says. via aksi bina puri sdn bhd, bina puri owns 70% of the land, with the remaining 30% equally

that wealthy terrace is equally owned by ng lui keng @ ng joo keng and tan wang tiang, while kochbil corp is equally owned by ooi thian huang and north port bulk services sdn bhd. resintech plastics is wholly owned by resintech bhd, a company controlled by datuk dr teh kim poo. valiant plus is owned by lim boon siong (90%) and lim boon han (10%). ng and tan are familiar names in corporate

more than 83% of its revenue for fy2014 was from construction, while property development accounted for only slightly more than 10%.  nevertheless, the companys property division registered a profit

rm2,360 per tonne, and they touched as low as rm2,082 per tonne at the end of last month. the export levies were reportedly imposed to fund indonesias recently announced biodiesel subsidies and it could help to underpin palm oil prices if biodiesel demand picks up. in a statement yesterday, minister of plantation industry and commodities datuk amar douglas uggah embas said the government is closely monitoring the situation and analysing any possible impact of indonesias export levies on the malaysian palm oil industry. he said a task force was formed to discuss and recommend policy options to the government. cimb researchs analyst ivy ng lee fang told the edge financial daily that the research house was not surprised by the news as the market had been anticipating the implementation of the levies since early april. details on the new regulations like whether all or selected processed palm oil products will be taxed remain unclear, she said. ng pointed that the export levies will not go down well with indonesian plantation owners because the tax will result in refiners squeezing the planters for lower prices. however, this could be offset by medium-term gains from higher cpo prices if the move boosts biodiesel usage significantly, she said. an analyst explained that the impact on companies like sime darby (fundamental: 1.0; valuation: 1.1) and klk (fundamental: 1.0; valuation: 0.5) would not be significant as both have exposure of merely 30% to 40%. kenanga research analyst voon yee ping said the new policy would reduce export volume from indonesia, thus benefiting malaysian palm oil producers. there will be restricted supply in the market in the short to medium term, she said. a public-listed cpo players executive said his management team understood that the new policy was necessary to be implemented. it is short-term pain for long-term gain, as it will ultimately promote biodiesel demand and drive up cpo prices, he said. the edge

pesticide manufacturer imaspro bhd, the latest investment target of datuk dr yu kuan chon, seems to have piqued the curiosity of investors again. they want to know what in it has attracted the veteran investor who is famed for taking up key stakes in lesser-known companies. while imaspro managing director tong chin hen claims to be unaware of why the company is subject to yus sudden interest, he points out that the local pesticide maker exports to the eu as its products are compliant with european requirements. we are the only malaysian producer whose products are proven equivalent in the eu, which allows us to sell to its members. the pesticide registration process is long and comprehensive and as tightly regulated as pharmaceutical drugs, he tells the edge in a telephone interview.  our products are registered in many countries. because of my background and with networking, we are very strong in eastern europe, he says, adding that imaspro has traditionally been very active in this region. tong adds that imaspros strong ties with communist countries like cuba has enabled it to gain entry into them. the company has 277 product registrations globally. in the financial year ended june 30, 2014, local sales accounted for about 45% of its revenue while 55% came from overseas. imaspro (fundamental: 1.45; valuation: 0.6) is in the business of manufacturing and distributing pesticides, including herbicides, insecticides and fungicides, as well as related agrochemicals. besides its eu certification, perhaps yu also likes the companys balance sheet, which showed net cash of rm51.3 million or 64 sen per share and zero borrowings as at dec 31, 2014. little-traded imaspro saw its volume skyrocket to 1.3 million compared with barely 200,000 shares a day in the past. the surge in interest sent up the companys share price to an all-time high of rm1.95 on march 25. however, it had retreated to rm1.74 by last friday. imaspro is trading at a price-earnings ratio of 16.4 times and has a market capitalisation of rm142.4 million. yu, who is ynh property bhd chairman and executive director, is now the second largest shareholder in imaspro with a 12.38% stake. his close associate, chan weng fui, has also emerged as a substantial shareholder with 5.49% equity interest or 4.39 million shares. chan is known to have worked closely with yu in past transactions, the most notable of which are rapid synergy bhd and pan malaysia holdings bhd  companies in which the latter has substantial interests. tong remains the single largest shareholder of imaspro with a 42.43% stake or 33.95 million shares through swiss revenue sdn bhd. he says imaspro plans to be more aggressive in the local market after successfully securing a tender recently to supply herbicides to sime darby plantation sdn bhd, although he notes that the contract is not much. we have not been actively involved in (tendering for projects) locally as we have been concentrating on overseas market growth. but we want to have a more aggressive policy on local plantations going forward, says tong, adding that management believes a stronger focus on the local plantation business would be worthwhile for imaspro. he says imaspro has come to a stage where its daily operations are on auto cruise. the companys net profit jumped from rm5.1 million in fy2012 to rm9.1 million in fy2014 but declined 10% to rm4.28 million in calendar year 2014. this was attributed to a lower margin caused by the fluctuating prices of its main raw material  glyphosate technical. in the second quarter ended dec 31, 2014 (2qfy2015), imaspros net profit fell to rm2.44 million from rm2.64 million in the previous corresponding period while revenue dropped to rm25.36 million from rm27.97 million. glyphosate is the most widely used agrochemical in the world. more than 50% of imaspros revenue is derived from glyphosate-related products, according to imaspros 2014 annual report. while the group purchasing policy keeps the procurement cycle to the shortest possible, we were nevertheless impacted by these widely fluctuating prices of glyphosate technical, it says, noting that the price of glyphosate technical went on a roller-coaster ride last year. cimb investment banks head of retail research for equities, kong seh siang, comments that should the raw materials price drop further, imaspro may have to write down more of its inventories. he says glyphosate prices have continued to weaken  from between us$4 and us$4.20 per kilogramme in 1qfy2015 to us$3.50 at present. imaspros lower revenue in the first half of fy2015 ended dec 31, 2014, was due to slower replanting of crops on subdued global commodity prices globally, kong points out. revenue decreased 11% to rm44.14 million from rm49.62 million a year ago in both the local and export segments, the weak outlook for commodity prices remains a banana skin here as planters may choose to defer purchases or even switch to cheaper pesticides in the near future, says kong.  crude palm oil prices had fallen 18.24% to rm2,156 per metric ton (mt) last thursday from rm2,637 a year ago. most research houses are neutral on the plantation sector with cpo price forecasts for this year ranging from about rm2,100 to rm2,700.  note: the edge research's fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet

listing of units", "article": " seven years after the synergy drive merger that saw guthrie and golden hope being folded into sime darby bhd to create the worlds largest listed plantation company, it seems that analysts and investors are anxious to see the conglomerate float some of its smaller units. its market capitalisation has doubled from rm28 billion in 2007, just ahead of the merger, to some rm55 billion today. it made some notable acquisitions during this period, including its 40% stake in the iconic battersea power station site. it also partnered ramsay health care to expand into another consumer stronghold and sold its oil and gas business. now, investors are keeping watch on when sime darby will revive the planned spinoff of its motor unit that has been postponed to the second half of calendar year 2015. theres also a second reason for investors keeping their eyes peeled  the conglomerate may once again be taking the lead in another mega merger to grow even bigger in the property business. just last month, following the release of its results for the first half of the financial year ending june 30, 2015, cimb research regional plantation analyst ivy ng, among other analysts, tells clients in a note that sime darbys weaker earnings are likely to be partially offset by potential acquisitions and the planned listing of certain key businesses. for fy2014 ended june 30, its motor business contributed 15% to earnings while real estate accounted for 14%. as the worlds third largest dealer of caterpillar heavy machinery, sime darbys industrial segment is also sizeable, accounting for some 24% of group profits. its core plantation business remains the groups largest earnings contributor at 45% last year and it was not too long ago that its strength helped keep the group profitable when some of its other businesses suffered losses. for its latest 2q numbers, however, sime darbys plantation and industrial businesses  its two largest contributing core segments  recorded a 46% and 53% year-on-year slump in earnings before interest and tax. apart from sime darby posting its weakest industrial earnings since the 2008 merger and getting a lower average selling price for its crude palm oil (cpo) of rm2,154 per tonne for 1hfy2015, cimbs ng also notes that simes 2q fresh fruit bunches (ffb) output fell 15% y-o-y in 2qfy15 and 6% in 1hfy2015 instead of growing 5% in line with managements guidance. sime darby attributed this to poor weather, a shift in cropping patterns and higher planting activity. it now expects flattish ffb output for fy2015 and cpo prices to range between rm2,300 and rm2,500 per tonne between march and june this year. experts at the recent palm and laurics oil conference 2015 in kuala lumpur projected prices to average between rm1,940 and rm2,500 per tonne for 2015, with the strength of demand for biodiesel being the most influential factor. thats still not too shabby given that sime darby president and group ceo tan sri mohd bakke salleh says costs for large players like itself range from rm1,300 to rm1,500 per tonne. this puts gross margins at over 33% if cpo prices were to hover around rm2,000 per tonne. the cyclical nature of the industry is not something we are unfamiliar with. if you look at why prices move so rapidly, it comes down to basic demand and supply. whatever the underlying causes  weather, disease, demand created by new markets like biodiesel  price is a factor of demand and supply. in the shorter term, current prices will affect higher-cost, less efficient and smaller players. in the longer term, the prices will find their equilibrium, as will the industry, bakke tells the edge in an interview, pointing out that prices would find support from national policies such as indonesias b15 and possibly b20 biodiesel blend. this will mop up a lot of supply from the worlds largest exporter of the oil for domestic consumption, he says. to be sure, the strength of sime darbys balance sheet during the challenging time of lower cpo prices means that it is better positioned to be a purchaser should smaller operators throw in the towel. yet, the verdict is split on whether sime darby paid a good price for its recently completed purchase of new britain palm oil ltd. sime darby is also not yet on top of the game in some areas, perhaps due to its size. analysts point out that smaller planters such as united plantations bhd achieve higher oil extraction rates (oer) and better ffb yield per hectare (yield/ha). while sime darbys group oer rose from 21.73% in 1hfy2014 to 21.8% in 1hfy2015, this is still below united plantations 22.5% in fy2013 and 22.77% in fy2014. during the same period, united plantations ffb yield/ha rose from 20.83 tonnes in 2013 to 21.4 tonnes in 2014. in its latest 1hfy15 earnings briefing, sime darby said its group ffb yield/ha fell in 1hfy2015, something which it attributed to higher replanting activity that resulted in the increase of immature hectarage, a shift in cropping trends, prolonged drought in the first half of 2014 as well as the impact of floods at the end of 2014. these are all valid reasons but observers reckon more should be done to ensure that numbers from its plantations business are a lot better. in this regard, sime darby has indeed come up with a game plan. bakke says a number of measures have already been implemented to vigorously manage costs. even our capex has been reviewed and we have halved our budgeted capex from rm7.4 billion to rm3.7 billion for the year. on the productivity and revenue side, whatever measures that are humanly possible are being worked on today  increasing revenue or ensuring we do not lose yields. pending results in this area, analysts and investors are looking out for a non-plantation catalyst from the group to boost sentiment on the stock.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on march 30 - april 5, 2015."}, "203": {"date_posted": "24/4/2015", "title": "trimming nbpol stake the next step", "article": "  new britain palm oil ltd (nbpol) came full circle when it returned to the sime darby fold earlier this year. as progression of time would have it, the event today essentially marks a homecoming or a reunion for the two companies that essentially share the same origin and history, datuk henry sackville barlow, chairman of nbpol, said in his address on march 2 in port moresby, papua new guinea, to mark the completion of the acquisition. sime darby managed to secure 98.8% in nbpol after the close of its general offer. on march 24, it said it will make a compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares in nbpol, after which the company will automatically be removed from the port moresby stock exchange. but the plan is to eventually relist nbpol. in an interview with the edge, sime darby bhd president and group chief executive tan sri mohd bakke salleh says the next step will be to bring in a strategic investor to reduce its shareholding in nbpol. we are going to sit down with the authorities in png to discuss how their institutions would like to be a part of us. at the same time, we are going to look for strategic investors outside malaysia and outside png  they could come from the ranks of other plantation companies, institutions or sovereign funds  to reduce our shareholding (in nbpol). in fact, bakke says the move to bring in an international investor is being worked on almost immediately. the png side will take some time but on the strategic investor, we have started already and at the right time, we will release the name. while no time frame has been set by the board, bakke says finding a strategic investor is being worked on as a matter of urgency. first of all, we have to sit down and discuss with the other side the benefits of them putting their money in nbpol and so on. a bit of history to put things in perspective: nbpol was established in 1966 by harrisons & crosfield,which is one of the three founding companies that eventually became the sime darby of today. nbpol started as a smallholder scheme, a joint venture between h&c and the png government. the first scheme was set up at hoskins in png, which was considered a pilot initiative back then. since then, nbpol has morphed into the largest plantation player in png with a landbank of 135,000ha as well as 12 oil mills, two refineries, a special fractionation plant and a bakery fats plant in the uk. in 1996, the png government divested its stake to kulim (m) bhd, whose stake sime darby eventually acquired as well as the rest of the nbpol shares via a general offer. the acquisition was completed on march 2 this year, sime darbys largest since its mega merger in 2007. most analysts view the acquisition positively, noting that nbpol is one of the more efficient players in the industry. we believe the earnings accretive deal will contribute about 4% to 5% to the groups earnings, opines public investment bank in a report. moodys concurs, noting that the acquisition would widen sime darbys competitive advantage in the upstream plantation segment. sime darby is the worlds largest upstream crude palm oil producer. the acquisition would increase its planted area by 15%. by comparison, the next largest are felda global ventures and golden agri-resources, it says in a report. nbpol will add 135,000ha to sime darbys landbank, bringing the total to almost one million hectares spread over five countries. nbpol, moodys adds, will enhance sime darbys european sales channel, given that its 300,000 tons per annum (tpa) refinery in liverpool is fully certified by the roundtable of sustainable palm oil (rspo). this complements sime darbys existing 450,000 tpa refinery in the netherlands. nbpols yields are above industry average. it recorded a fresh fruit bunch yield of 21.7mt/ha in 2013, which was higher than that of sime darby (19.9mt/ha) and other large players. sime darby will be forking out rm5.85 billion for nbpol, or u00a37.15 per share. this is 1.28 times net tangible asset value (ntav) and at an 80% premium to the market price at the time. including assumed debt of rm850 million in nbpols balance sheet, the cost would total rm6.47 billion, notes moodys. is this on the expensive side? views are mixed. some analysts feel that at 1.28 times ntav, the price is justified given the scarcity of such landbank and the fact that png is a much better location for expansion compared with africa. others view the valuation as expensive, more so when commodity prices are in a down cycle and plantation companies are feeling the impact on their bottom line. nbpol, in particular, saw a sharp fall in its earnings in fy2011, fy2012 and fy2013. in fy2010, it recorded a net profit of us$266.4 million but this plunged to just us$66.4 million in fy2011. earnings fell to a mere us$1.6 million in fy2012 before recovering to us$50.1 million in fy2013 and us$68.6 million in fy2014. bakke, however, is confident that nbpol will get back on its growth path. nbpols performance has been strong and shown fairly consistent growth in the recent past. the temporary setback in earnings is in line with extreme weather conditions that affected the industry and the efforts to rehabilitate plantation assets following the acquisition of cargill estates in png, he says. bakke believes what is more important is that nbpol should not be evaluated as a standalone company but as part of the bigger sime darby family. together, both nbpol and sime darby are now on a much sounder platform for growth. i have no doubts about that. based on a funding mix of 80% debt and 20% cash, moodys says this could result in sime darbys gross leverage reaching 2.6 times to 2.9 times after the transaction. such a range would be too high for its current a3 rating, it notes. indeed, a view is that raising gearing at this time may not be prudent, given current market conditions (falling cpo prices and slowing economic growth). but bakke believes that sime darbys new gearing level is not one that creates an untenable situation that is risky for the groups business. he explains: as at the end of this financial year, we expect our gross gearing ratio to be about 62% to 63%; this is all right by industry standards. it is not above 1.0, which will be cause for concern. bear in mind that this gearing ratio is calculated on the basis that all our plantation assets are reflected at cost. we have not revalued our assets. so, if we do a revaluation, there will be an improvement in equity value. furthermore, sime darby will pare down its borrowings. the deal has happened and what is important now is to identify the means to bring down the gearing, and we will find a solution, he says. initiatives have already been started to pare down the bonds, and sime darby is working hard to improve free cash flow in its business, he adds. in terms of listing our motor business, it is a question of timing; it will give us the source to reduce our borrowings. for some years now, sime darby has been looking to expand its plantation landbank. today, apart from png, its plantations span indonesia, malaysia and liberia. according to bakke, increasing its plantation hectarage in png is part of sime darbys plan further down the road, the expansion made easier with the acquisition of nbpol.  by anna taing  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on march 30 - april 5, 2015."}, "204": {"date_posted": "24/4/2015", "title": "keeping sime on an even keel", "article": " \nit wasnt the best of times at sime darby group when tan sri mohd bakke salleh was parachuted in as president and group ceo on july 15, 2010. the group had been going through a period of turbulence since late 2009, when news began to surface that all was not well in its energy and utilities division. by the middle of 2010, things had come to a head; the then president and group ceo datuk seri ahmad zubir murshid was asked to go on leave. by then, the e&u division was deeply in the red. in fy2009/10, this division reported an operating loss of rm1.8 billion, according to sime darbys 2010 annual report. at the group level, fy2010 net profit shrank to rm726.8 million from rm2.28 billion in fy2009. it was during these troubled times that bakke took the helm and his immediate mandate was to put the house in order. this meant making many hard and unpopular decisions that would not sit well with some quarters. according to insiders, bakke braved the elements and did what needed to be done, including streamlining group operations and disposing of the e&u division, which had been with the group for 25 years. another daunting task was to drive the groups plans through following the mega-merger that resulted in sime darby becoming the worlds largest plantation company in 2007. the task was made all the more difficult because almost all the key people involved in the 2007 merger had left. all that is now water under the bridge. today, sime darby is back on an even keel. there is no let-up for bakke, though. he is once again being challenged, this time by an operating environment that is roiled by falling commodity prices and a slower-than-expected recovery in global growth. indeed, going by the earnings performance in the first half of fy2015, sime darby is unlikely to meet the full-year forecast of rm2.5 billion. the edge sat down with bakke for an interview when he was in port moresby, papua new guinea, to attend an event to mark the completion of sime darbys acquisition of new britain palm oil ltd (nbpol) on march 2. this is his first media interview on his five-year journey, the challenges and what more is to come since taking up the reins of the company in 2010. when i first joined sime darby, the priority then was to put the group on a much stronger footing. having done that, weve put in place a five-year strategy to realise the full potential of our core businesses and achieve leadership positions, says bakke. how much traction has that gained? were on the right track, but the global environment has been challenging, and weve had to refine our business strategies to address the consolidation of the mining industry in australia, credit tightening and stricter regulations in the motor and property businesses (in malaysia), for example, says bakke. what have been his biggest challenges in the last five years? there have been many but the main one would be the weak commodity prices. our two biggest divisions  plantations and industrial  are facing lower cpo (crude palm oil) and coal prices ... another key challenge is identifying the right opportunities when times are difficult. even so, bakke takes such challenges in his stride. challenges will always be there in a business environment that is dynamic. whenever something crops up, we will have to work out a response or solution to the problem. thats what business is all about.  the following is an excerpt of the interview. the edge: what more, in your view, could be done to unlock value for sime darbys shareholders?tan sri mohd bakke salleh: sime darby is always evaluating opportunities to create more value for shareholders but we are also mindful of doing them at the right time. we will continue to improve our operational efficiencies and pursue strategic portfolio growth. the latter could be anything from acquisitions and initial public offerings to strategic alliances. we could not achieve anything of the above without people. thus, we have in place our talent development and human capital management to ensure we have the best personnel to execute the strategies. sime darbys ops were rationalised into five divisions under your stewardship. some of these units have potential for listing. you have talked about the motor sector ipo. what about the property division, which has come under a lot of speculation pertaining to a possible merger with other pnb (permodalan nasional bhd) property arms?\nour focus is to realise the full potential of our property business. we are working towards diversifying our earnings base by developing commercial properties with recurring income potential and in terms of geography. as for strategic alliances, the battersea project is a good example of the opportunities that are out there. as for plans that are being reported in the media, we cannot comment on speculation. what have been the biggest challenges for you in the last five years?\nthere have been many but the main one would be weak commodity prices. our two biggest divisions  plantation and industrial  are facing lower cpo and coal prices respectively. having said that, we expanded to liberia in 2009 and acquired bucyrus in 2011, which will position us well when the markets turn around. another key challenge is identifying the right opportunities when times are difficult. going by your latest financial results, the downturn in commodity prices and a tough economic environment are beginning to bite. how are you strategising to ride out this period?\nwe have been sharing this with the market. today, we have implemented a number of measures to vigorously manage our costs, even our capex has been reviewed and we have halved our budgeted capex from rm7.4 billion to rm3.7 billion for the year (for fy2015) (excluding the nbpol acquisition). as for operating costs, we have identified areas where we have to reduce the expenditure and only incur expenditure if it is deemed necessary. on the productivity side and revenue, whatever measures that are humanly possible are being worked on today: increasing revenue or ensuring that we do not lose on yields. yields are dependent on a number of factors, for example the age of the palms is important, the weather and also the human touch, the manuring programmes, the planting materials. weather indeed is an important factor. on the human measures, it is about improving agronomic practices and competence. one of the benefits i am looking forward to from this exercise (the acquisition of nbpol) is the cross fertilisation of agro management practices. sime darby may miss the rm2.5 billion profit kpi?\ni think you guys are drawing conclusions about it. we achieved 38% of our target (for the first half) but even the kpi that we set was done based on a number of assumptions. but if the actual scenario differs from what was assumed  obviously, that will have an impact but we will try to mitigate the impact of the new scenarios with other measures towards meeting the kpi. are you worried about the impact of a weakening ringgit?\nthe weakening ringgit helped our cpo exports but it is not good for the auto business. having said that, the good thing is that 50% of our revenue comes from overseas business. sime darbys yield trend is flat or even falling. why?\ntoday, we have increased the percentage of replanting. the rule of thumb is that if you assume a 25-year age of palms cycle, it means that every year, you need to set aside 4% for replanting, but we decided to increase that, especially for indonesia. that will also pull down our yields. in terms of areas affected by tree stress and weather-related factors, in indonesia, the effects are still there. then in malaysia, in the first six months of last year, we had dry weather. today, we are not getting the targeted yields. as for human contribution, that is the agronomic practices. we are doing what is considered best in class practices, in terms of loose fruit collection, making sure crop recovery is 100%, the waiting period is reduced  all these things are in place. we have implemented a system in head office that can monitor the activities of our estates. we look at the screen to see whats happening on the ground, we have given out this gadget to our conductors, estate managers. we know what they have done for the day, on the basis of extracting the most from the use of technology. so, we still have scope for improvement but whatever is considered to be useful tools to enhance performance, we have already adopted them. and we will continue to improve on this. when do you expect to see an upturn in yield performance?\ni think by next year, when we report our next financial results, it has to be higher than what we will eventually achieve this year. this is something being worked on all the time by getting input from agronomists and so on, changing and tweaking our practices. water management is another area. in estates where we are able to roll out good water management facilities, we have observed an improvement in yields. oil palm estates live on water. to increase coverage of our water management support system for the entire group will be onerous from a cost perspective because you need to spend money to set up a watering system. it is not cheap. to get the full impact and desired effect, the estimate is rm8,000 to rm10,000 per hectare. in the long run, there will be a significant impact on yields. these measures are being looked at, reviewed and tried on a pilot basis in a few of our estates. ideally, water management infrastructure should be extended to all our estates but this is financially burdensome.\nthe other thing to improve productivity is to replant with new planting materials that will give us better yields. we have planting materials that can give us oil yields of anything between 8 and 12 tonnes per hectare ... but now we are only enjoying around five tonnes per hectare. how long do you expect this challenging period to continue?\nthe cpo price today is around rm2,300. even if it stays at around this level, we will continue to make reasonable profits. but if it firms up to rm2,400 to rm2,500, the better for us. as for our property business, 60% to 75% of our products are below rm700,000 in terms of pricing. we have seen strong take-up rates in our recent launches, such as nafiri 2 in bandar bukit raja, aralia in elmina east and azalea in nilai impian. we expect demand for properties to remain robust, especially among genuine buyers looking for long-term value appreciation and rental income. this is where demand is still resilient. as for the auto business, there are new challenges, like the impact of forex on cbus (completely built-up units) and overlapping of the sales tax with gst (goods and services tax).  once the market digests this, the motor business will continue to grow. we see that every year  there has been an increase in total industry volume, 2% growth on average. in singapore, the outlook is improving compared with a year ago. china is the largest market in the world, we cannot ignore it, all the auto players are represented there. at a recent conference on the outlook for cpo, a widely held view was that prices could go below rm2,000 to about rm1,800. how would this change the industry dynamics?\npalm oil is a commodity and like all other commodities, prices are cyclical. just a few years ago, rm2,500 to rm3,000 was considered the normal range for prices. not that long ago, in 2008, prices touched rm4,203 but in 2001, just seven years before that, prices hit a low of rm625. the cyclical nature of the industry is not something we are unfamiliar with. if you look at why prices move so rapidly, it comes down to basic demand and supply. whatever the underlying causes  weather, disease, demand created by a new market like biodiesel  price is a factor of demand and supply. in the shorter term, current prices will affect higher cost, less efficient and smaller players. in the longer term, the prices will find their equilibrium, as will the industry. today, prices are hovering just above rm2,000. costs, for larger players like us, range from about rm1,300 to rm1,500 a tonne. but for smaller players, costs can be higher, which means their profit margins will be squeezed. it is at times such as these that good assets can become available as those who had higher entry costs or less holding power seek to exit the industry. we have seen abandoned plantations, smallholders who have to resort to other ways of earning a living not harvesting their trees and cost-cutting measures that involve the reduction of fertiliser application. all of these will result in reduced production and you will start seeing stock levels come off within 6 to 12 months. furthermore, there is the additional consideration that cpo is an edible oil and a perfect substitute for other edible oils, such as soy, corn and rapeseed. when edible oil prices dip to unattractive levels, farmers of annual crops shift to other crops, as they have in the past, which will again affect demand. finally, there are national policies that we should also consider. indonesia has just announced a biodiesel blend of b15. it is looking at the possibility of b20. this will mop up a lot of supply from the worlds largest exporter of the oil for domestic consumption.  africa was a new frontier for sime darby. how much traction has liberia gained? how big a setback was the ebola outbreak?\nwe believe that weve made considerable progress, although planting 10,000ha since 2010 is slower relative to what were used to in asia. the ebola outbreak was unfortunate because we were making strides in our refined fpic (free, prior and informed consent) process. the good news is that new ebola cases have dwindled and we expect to resume full operations this year. as a long-term investor, we still believe in the potential of africa as the new frontier for oil palm. what about indonesia? there was talk that sime darby is restructuring its indonesian assets. how much traction has the restructuring gained?\nas mentioned before in our media briefings, we are still examining the options and we will make an announcement at the appropriate time. on the acquisition of nbpol there is a view that given current market conditions, the price that sime darby paid for nbpol was on the expensive side?\nwe believe we have paid a fair market price.the price expectation of a successful acquisition following the failed kulim bid was between u00a36.50 and u00a37 per share. we paid u00a37.15 per share, which was at a slight premium to that price. but i think this price is acceptable, given the scarcity of suitable landbank and the high costs and risks associated with greenfield developments. we see this as a rare opportunity that should not be missed. in return for the premium, we are getting quality brownfield assets, that is ~135,000ha of landbank with ~81,500ha planted that are fully rspo certified. besides oil palm, nbpol is also involved in beef, sugar and seed production. furthermore, sime darby sees this acquisition as the gateway to future expansion within and outside png. hence, we believe the quality of the assets justifies the price. what is clearly visible to the market is the strength of nbpols upstream business.however, for sime darby, the downstream business is the hidden jewel in nbpol.it has succeeded in commanding a price premium for its sustainable palm products.\ni think not every plantation player will be able to appreciate nbpols strengths. sime darby and nbpols strengths in the production of sustainable palm oil represent not only our shared business practices and beliefs but also a platform to do greater things together across the value chain. can you talk about sime darbys plans to tap nbpols strengths?\nas we work towards integrating operations, there will be lots of opportunities for us to cross fertilise, in areas where we hope to generate benefits  which will have an impact on sime darbys other operations. they will also benefit from our contributions. its a synergistic outcome  the synergy achieved by both parties. from nbpols perspective, how will it benefit?\nfor a start, it is going to be part of a company with a bigger balance sheet now. future expansion will be driven by sime darbys balance sheet. we are already looking at increasing the landbank and in png alone, we can easily increase it by 20,000ha. these are areas that have already been identified. these are greenfields that can be developed into oil palm estates. they will not be problematic as far as sustainability issues are concerned because they comply with the principles. why did it take sime darby so long to come into png?\nwe first came here in 2009 and there were subsequent visits but to secure sizeable tracts of land was a challenge. we could not find anything suitable. other companies were not able to establish a presence here as well. interestingly enough, way back in 2012, i sat down with kulims directors to negotiate an offer to take over their block and do a go, and they asked for u00a39. we backed off. later, we found out from rhb bank that it was keen to dispose of its shareholding after it could not increase its stake from 49% to about 65%. when rhb contacted us, we said, fine, did all the legwork and took part in a tender exercise. of course, when you are involved in such an exercise, its not easy because you have to try to read the minds of other bidders. if it is a one-on-one deal, its take it or leave it. but in a tender exercise, especially in the field that has other established companies with deep pockets, the tender price has to be in an attractive range. it was based on a combination of factors  looking at the financial impact on our balance sheet, how our earnings will improve and quantifying the indirect impact of the acquisition. that is the financial benefits that will accrue to us with cross fertilisation of the two companies. the (tender) price (was one) that gave us the best opportunity and a likely probability of winning the bid. if nbpol is good, why did kulim sell?\ni cannot answer for the company but from what little i know about the decision to sell, it could not increase its stake. on what exchange rate is the amount that sime darby has to pay for nbpol based on, given that the ringgit is weakening?\nbefore we made payments, we had already bought sterling forward ... the average rate was rm5.50. the rate that prevailed in june last year was around rm5.40 to rm5.45, then it came down to rm5.41 to rm5.42 and then moved up to rm5.50. now, it is rm5.60. the moment we decided that our bid was successful, we decided that the right thing to do was to lock in the exchange rate. we did not cover everything because we did it in stages. your view on fund raising now?\nas far as we are concerned, the lines were secured last october, so now it is just making payments. at the end of the financial year, we expect our gross gearing ratio to be about 62% to 63%; this is still all right by industry standards, it is not above one, which will be a cause for concern. bear in mind that this gearing ratio is calculated on the basis that all our plantation assets are reflected at cost. we have not revalued our assets; so if we do a revaluation, there will be an improvement in equity value. have you set kpis for nbpol?\nwe will discuss this at our board meeting; we will talk about a five- year plan. all along, it was a standalone company, now it is part of the sime darby family. the way it rolls out its business will need to move in harmony with sime darbys aspiration and strategy roadmap. nick thompson, in his speech, alluded that nbpol had done well in the past because management was given authority and the freedom to act and so on. how far will this continue?\nthis is the beginning of a new phase, a journey that will see exciting things and developments. the immediate thing that has come out of this acquisition is that we will be appointing simon lord, who is the head of sustainability, as head of sime darbys group sustainability. simon is acknowledged as one of the top sustainability guys in the market. we hope that by having him on board, our sustainability standards will be further improved. enhancing our sustainability profile translates into financial benefits. one of nbpols key strengths is sustainability value and it produces around half a million tonnes while we have been producing 2.4 million to 2.5 million tonnes. so, you see the impact on our production, it is enormous. there are other things in the pipeline which i cannot share with you today, where an acquisition will open doors for other favourable developments. is it being explored?\nyes. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on march 30 - april 5, 2015.

valuation: 1.20) will become stronger under the leadership of the government-linked utility company. in its original plan, perak corp was to use all the proceeds from the divestment  some rm153.86 million  to fund its projects and partly settle its borrowings. however, after the egm, aminuddin said the board will consider the shareholders request for a special dividend. sources close to the deal also tell the edge that tenaga is confident of receiving at least 51% acceptance of its takeover offer for integrax, inclusive of perak corps 15.74% stake. tenaga owned a 28.32% stake in integrax as at march 27, up from 22.12% when it first made the offer in january. with perak corps acceptance, it has secured a 44.06% stake. support from perak corp was crucial and luckily for tenaga, the state outfit did not consider an offer from integraxs co-founder, amin halim rasip, to buy a 5% stake in the port operator at rm3.50 per share, which was 25 sen more than tenagas offer. after that, amin commenced legal action to thwart tenagas offer, saying it undervalued integrax. amin, who is deputy chairman of integrax, has a 24.61% stake in the company. perak corp has said it is seeking legal advice on the letter of demand dated march 24 sent by amins solicitors. when met at the egm, amin expressed his disappointment at the shareholders approval of the disposal. at the meeting, minority shareholders made various proposals, including the option to wait and seek higher offers and that it should be sold at rm3.66 per share. but perak corp decided against it. it is a grave concern that it did not go out to get higher offers. according to amin, he and several other malaysian partners are planning to make a voluntary general offer for integrax. before the egm, amin had proposed an additional resolution to require perak corp to invite further offers from tenaga or any other party to seek a minimum offer of rm3.66 per share. however, his proposal was turned down before the egm. the company said it could not grant amins request at the egm last friday as the proposed modification and addition of resolution would be tantamount to a new business. it also noted that for a business to be transacted at an egm, the shareholders must be given at least 14 days notice. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers.the valuation score determines if a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers.a score of3 suggests strongfundamentals andattractive valuations. visitwww.theedgemarkets.comfor more details on a companys financial dashboard. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on march 30 - april 5, 2015."}, "208": {"date_posted": "15/4/2015", "title": "marc affirms ratings, stable outlook on sime darbys rm4.5 bil icp/imtn programme", "article": " kuala lumpur (april 15): malaysian rating corp bhd (marc) affirmed today its ratings on sime darby bhds rm4.5 billion islamic medium-term notes programme (imtn programme) and rm500 million islamic commerical papers (icp), with a combined limit of rm4.5 billion (icp/imtn programme). the outlook on the ratings is stable, said marc. the stable outlook reflects marcs expectations that sime darby (fundamental: 1.0;

stake in s p setia", "article": " sime darby bhd may buy permodalan nasional bhds (pnb) stake in s p setia bhd as a first step towards consolidating the property portfolio of pnb. sources say a proposal has been put forward to the relevant parties but it is not clear if pnb, sime and s p setia are receptive to it as it would be a massive undertaking. pnb has a 51.12% stake in s p setia (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 1.2) and a direct 10.06% shareholding in sime (fundamental: 1.0; valuation: 0.90) with another 36.73% held via skim amanah saham bumiputera. if the proposal comes to fruition, sime would have to make a mandatory general offer (mgo) for s p setia as the 51.12% stake exceeds the mgo trigger point of 33%. it would be a hefty acquisition. given s p setias market capitalisation of rm8.54 billion as at last friday, pnbs 51.12% stake is worth rm4.37 billion. nevertheless, simes market cap is much larger, at rm57.52 billion. sources say such a deal is unlikely to be facilitated by a share swap as s p setias minority shareholders may not like exchanging their shares in a property company for those in a conglomerate with diversified businesses such as plantations, automotive and so forth, apart from property. for sime to fund a cash deal, it could likely resort to a rights issue where pnb could subscribe for its entitlement by utilising the proceeds from s p setia. while consolidation of pnbs property portfolio remains the key reason, the motivation for such a deal could be because both sime and s p setia are entering into a slow growth phase due to a challenging environment in the plantation and property sectors. in the financial year ended oct 31, 2014 (fy2014), s p setia saw its net profit fall 3% to rm405.7 million from rm418.3 million the previous year despite revenue rising 16.8% to rm3.8 billion. sime, meanwhile, saw its net profit decline to rm938.1 million in the six months ended dec 31, 2014, from rm1.31 billion previously due mainly to weak commodity prices. market observers say it makes sense for sime and s p setia to merge. they each have a 40% stake in battersea power station development co ltd while the employees provident fund holds the remaining 20%. the battersea project in london has an estimated gross development value (gdv) of rm50 billion. datuk seri abd wahab maskan, managing director of simes unlisted property arm sime darby property bhd (sime property), told the edge financial daily last september that the gdv of sime propertys projects could exceed rm100 billion. this excludes its share of the battersea projects gdv as well as the development potential of some of simes plantation estates in emerging areas, which could further increase the potential gdv. in terms of property assets, sime could be one of the largest property players in the country, alongside ioi properties group bhd (gdv: over rm100 billion) and s p setia bhd (gdv: rm71 billion). sime also holds a 21.95% stake worth about rm570.7 million in penang-based developer eastern & oriental bhd. rumours about a consolidation or merger of property assets of sorts between sime and s p setia are not new. in s p setias case, questions about its direction and leadership have swirled around since the departure of former president and chief executive tan sri liew kee sin last april. liew was synonymous with the s p setia brand and has set the bar very high for his successor. lined up to take over his duties were the then chief financial officer datuk teow leong seng and deputy president and chief operating officer datuk voon tin yow. they were supposed to stay on until this year but teow left in mid-2014, followed by voon in december. deputy president datuk khor chap jen has now taken the helm of the company. sime, meanwhile, needs huge management resources to spur the development of its massive landbank. with plantations being its core business all these years, the group has traditionally focused its management resources on this sector instead of property development. as for pnb, a merger between sime and s p setia would enable it to restructure the assets and strengthen the property divisions management, thus paving the way for an even larger property entity to be listed on bursa malaysia. it is worth noting that pnb wholly owns i&p group sdn bhd, which was formed in 2009 out of the merger of island & peninsular bhd, petaling garden bhd and pelangi bhd. when contacted, sime darby says it cannot comment on speculation while pnb could not be reached. note: the edge researchs fundamental

minorities again", "article": " perak corp bhd, the public-listed development arm of the perak government, is likely to face an unhappy group of minority shareholders again at an extraordinary general meeting (egm) to be held on march 27. the egm is to let shareholders vote on the proposed sale of the groups 15.74% stake in integrax bhd to tenaga nasional bhd for a total of rm150.31 million or rm3.25 per integrax share. perak corps minorities could be unhappy because the board doesnt plan to distribute any of the sale proceeds to shareholders, but intends to fully utilise them for working capital and repayment of borrowings. whats more, despite an egm being convened, minorities dont have much say because state entity perak state development corp (pknp) controls some 52.9% of perak corp. since it is not a related-party deal with tenaga, pknp alone could vote in favour of perak corp selling the integrax stake. for the proposed sale to go through, perak corp needs at least 50% plus one share from shareholders. the indications are that pknp will support the deal. perak corps board, with representatives linked to the perak government, had on feb 26 announced its decision to recommend that its shareholders accept the revised offer from tenaga. the initial offer was rm2.75, but it was revised to rm3.25, following the suggestion of perak corp to tenaga. perak corps minorities may want a higher price from the integrax deal. in a march 4 statement, m&a securities, which is acting as an independent adviser to the takeover offer, described the revised offer of rm3.25 as not fair. m&a values each integrax share at between rm3.60 and rm3.66. the integrax deal aside, it is worth noting that perak corps minorities have just had a run-in with pknp, which tried to privatise perak corp at rm3.90 per share via a selective capital reduction exercise late last year. owning to the objection of the minorities, notably sime darby property bhd, which owns a 6.12% stake in perak corp, pknp was forced to abort the privatisation exercise, which was said to have undervalued perak corp. back to the integrax deal, one representative of a minority shareholder group in perak corp said, it is unfortunate that minorities will not have a say in this stake sale given pknps majority position. with no special dividend at all [from the sale proceeds], a more sceptical shareholder would perceive this as a punishment for minorities for blocking the privatisation exercise [by pknp last year]. according to perak corps board, the proposed sale proceeds of rm150.31 million will go towards enhancing the groups balance sheet, with rm77.69 million to be utilised for working capital, and rm72 million to repay borrowings. the group holds cash of rm107.56 million as at dec 31, 2014, with total borrowings of rm104.92 million. with the repayment, its debt will come down to rm32.92 million, and cash level increase to some rm186 million. minus the remaining debt, perak corp will have a net cash position of rm153 million, compared with its current market capitalisation of rm307 million at its share price of rm3.03 last thursday. the proposed sale of the integrax stake would also enable perak corp to book a net gain of rm52.3 million from its investment, hence improving its net asset value per share to as high as rm5.70 from rm5.14 at present. however, this will further widen the discount between its current share price and net asset value per share. in a nutshell, minorities would generally not be in favour of any listed firm keeping all the cash from major divestment exercises for fear of related-party acquisitions that may result in cash being channelled to the major shareholder in exchange for low-yielding assets. that is, unless the listed firm has a good track record in making use of its cash reserves to make acquisitions or expand its businesses to achieve even better returns. thus far, perak corp has not elaborated on its plan to further grow its businesses with proceeds from the integrax stake sale. at present, the group derives its earnings from port operations and property development. port operations contributed rm38.42 million to the groups total pre-tax profit of rm70.86 million in fy2014, while property development contributed rm34.15 million, a sharp increase from rm9.49 million the year before. analysts say there is limited growth for the groups port operations. the throughput at its 50%-plus-one-share owned lumut maritime terminal has remained flat at about three million metric tonnes over the past three years due to the small ports dependence on hinterland cargo. its 20-year concession agreement with the state for exclusive port operations within a 30km radius will also end in july. given the limited growth potential of its port assets, perak corp crucially needs funds to fast-track its 1,500-acre township development in bandar meru raya, perak. the proceeds from the proposed integrax stake sale, it seems, would come in handy, but minorities chafing at perak corps relatively low shareholders returns over the past few years would also be eager for a windfall. note: the edge

it is not so much about realising trapped values. it is for them to hold all the family members together, by holding the investments at ytl corp. then, they control from there, says muh rong. whether a holding company structure is efficient or not, it depends on what the owner thinks and wants. if the owner wants to maintain control in the sense of wrapping the entire group, it will be through an investment holding company. but, for investors, is it the best to have a structure like that? not necessarily. for investors, no one is stopping them from investing directly. if they dont like the holding company, they can always invest in the subsidiaries. despite the fact that ytl corp (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 1.2) trades at a lower price-to-earnings multiple compared with some of its bursa-listed subsidiaries, the yeoh family is seen as being comfortable with the groups structure as the profits from these companies still flow back to the top. ytl group comprises bursa-listed ytl power international bhd, ytl land & development bhd, ytl e-solutions bhd and ytl hospitality real estate investment trust (reit) and singapore-listed starhill global reit. ytl power (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 2.4) operates power plants and treats waste water, besides owning ytl communications sdn bhd, which is the 4g mobile telecommunications operator. ytl land (fundamental: 0.7; valuation: 0.9) is a property development company and ytl reit (fundamental: 0.15; valuation: 3) manages the groups hospitality properties. as at feb 16, ytl corp was traded at 14 times its historical earnings per share, while ytl land and ytl e-solutions were valued at 30.6 times and 20.8 times respectively. in a report dated feb 13, cimb research ascribed a 20% discount to ytl corps revalued net asset value (rnav) of rm2.92 per share, giving it a fair value of rm2.34. while investors can always choose to bet on either ytl corp or any of its listed subsidiaries, for instance, they have no choice when it comes to investing in malaysian resources corp bhd (mrcb). this is because the group is the only listed entity, holding all the property development assets and construction and concession businesses. in a report dated dec 16, 2014, rhb research institute values the rnav of mrcb (fundamental: 0.45; valuation: 0.6) at rm2 per share. the group was trading at rm1.42 last tuesday, a discount of almost 30% to its rnav. the emergence of conglomerates the conglomerate corporate structure came in vogue in the 1990s in asia. the decade saw the emergence of big conglomerates in major asian economies, ranging from state-owned enterprises to family-owned groups. also, as a corporation grows, it usually embarks on an expansion drive through mergers and acquisitions. often these corporations end up having multiple businesses, which could be grouped under a separate stand-alone entity.  the growth will come to a point where the corporation has become too big with multiple core businesses.shareholders would soon realise that investors are not rewarding the group for the high-growth areas that they have invested in. when a conglomerate comes to a situation like that, they will start to think of ways to unlock the values of their businesses. there are two ways to do that: by injecting assets into another public-listed company to get shares in that company, and by asset disposals, says muh rong. the 1998 asian financial crisis proved to be the undoing of some of the conglomerates that grew too fast. the rapid expansion of these corporations involved debt accumulation, which proved to be unsustainable. the rapid depreciation of the baht, won, ringgit and rupiah led to prominent conglomerates being broken up as they struggled under the weight of mounting foreign currency debt. in malaysia, the restructuring of the renong-uem group and the listing of mrcbs media businesses are some of the examples of conglomerates being restructured to pare down debts. the disposal of multi-purpose holdings bhds (mphb) associate stake in sarawak enterprise (now sarawak energy bhd) was to unlock value. conglomerates seem to be less favoured by investors today compared with the 1990s. one of the after-effects of the asian financial crisis is that investors are quite averse to conglomerate structures and are keener to invest in groups with two or three focused businesses. this is because while it is easier for conglomerates to raise funds, their sheer size and multiple core businesses make them very difficult for the top management to focus sometimes, says danny. i am among those who like stand-alone businesses more than conglomerates. first, the structure is better because each of the businesses will have a better view of debt-to-equity ratio. there could also be a different dividend policy, he says. companies with capital-intensive businesses may pay lower dividends compared with those with more mature businesses, as they will have to reserve cash for reinvestments. investing in stand-alone businesses allows the investor to choose the kind of dividend payout ratio that he is comfortable with. if i am investing in a conglomerate, the dividend policy would have to consider the capital requirements of all its businesses, danny explains. in recent years, some major shareholders of listed corporations in malaysia have undertaken restructuring to unlock value within the group. in the past, there had been several such restructurings, thus benefiting shareholders. the more prominent ones include the relisting of ioi properties group bhd by ioi corp bhd, the demerger of mphb into magnum bhd and mphb capital bhd, and the demerger of telekom malaysia bhd (see corporate exercises  boon or bane for investors?). the demerger of the gaming and financial service businesses of mphb also unlocked the values of the property assets owned by both groups, which was almost similar to the case of the restructuring of the cheung kong-hutchison whampoa group. ioi corps (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 2.1) listing of its property development business has also unlocked values and separates the growth needs of that arm from those of the plantation business. berjaya corp (fundamental: 0.35; valuation: 1.2) has over the last few years undertaken a few rounds of successful listing of its food, retail and motor businesses, making the major shareholder many times richer. for instance, the listing of berjaya auto bhd has increased the value of berjaya corps 67.6% stake in the business by at least four times. conglomerate sime darby bhd is now working on the listing of its automotive arm this year to unlock value for its shareholders. sime darby motors distributes bmw cars in hong kong, china, vietnam and australia. this could be followed by the listing of its indonesian plantation assets. it is worth noting that sime darby (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.3) is the result of the synergy drive mega merger of nine plantation and property companies owned by permodalan nasional bhd. the enlarged sime darby was relisted on bursa in 2007.  the merger was initially seen as beneficial to shareholders of the companies involved, including the original sime darby, golden hope plantations bhd and guthrie bhd, as a bigger conglomerate would be able to expand its businesses more rapidly. however, sime darbys shares have been trading at less than rm10 over the last six years. from the relisting on nov 27, 2007, to last tuesday, the share price of sime darby has depreciated 12.9%, supporting the argument that the mega merger has failed to create value for its shareholders. nevertheless, an investor who had bought sime darby shares in early 2007, before the mega merger, would still be better off  making a capital gain of at least 50% on the original investment  if he had held on to his shares up to last tuesday. corporate advisers believe that the owners and top management of conglomerates know what they want and have strategies to achieve their internal objectives. restructuring should be done for the right reasons. i am sure there are always values to be unlocked in a conglomerate, but it all boils down to the strategy of the management. we can make a lot of assumptions, but the management knows better what it wants to do. for example, if sime darby were to list any of its businesses, it should be done so that it is easier for the individual businesses to raise funds for future expansion, says kenny yee, head of research of bimb securities. although conglomerates are less favoured these days, muh rong believes that there could come a time when the diversified group structure is back as the darling of investors. this is when groups can prove to investors that they can undertake big projects more efficiently than smaller stand-alone companies, she says. when the market realises that diversified groups can do big deals in an efficient manner, then the market will start paying premium on the stocks. they need to be big but do smart deals, deals that bring value to their shareholders. if they can do that, investors will trust their judgements, she adds.  note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers. a score of 3 suggests strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. visit www.theedgemarkets.com for more details on a companys financial dashboard. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on february 23 - 29, 2015."}, "222": {"date_posted": "19/3/2015", "title": "sime darby receives notice of arbitration from mmhe", "article": " kuala lumpur (march 19): sime darby bhd announced its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary sime darby engineering sdn bhd (sde) has received a notice of arbitration from malaysia marine and heavy engineering sdn bhd (mmhe) on march 17. in a filing with the bourse today, sime said the notice is for the resolution of disputes between mmhe and sde, in relation to the sale and purchase agreement (spa) and supplemental sale and purchase agreement (sspa) dated march 30, 2012, for the disposal of sdes oil and gas business to mmhe (fundamental: 1.4;

earnings expected to be lower", "article": " sime darby bhd\n(feb 27, rm9.33)\nmaintain neutral call with a lower target price (tp) of rm8.50: sime darbys (sime)s six-month period of financial year ending june 30, 2015 (6mfy15) results were disappointing, due to weaker plantation and heavy equipment earnings. we maintain neutral, with a tp of rm8.50 (9.3% downside). as we believe this could be the first year sime does not meet its key performance indicators profit target of rm2.5 billion, we reduce our forecasts to reflect this. nevertheless, news flow surrounding its demerger or restructuring plans could still provide support to its share price. simes 6mfy15 core earnings were below expectations at 34% and 31% of our and consensus fy15 forecasts (f). the main variances were lower-than-expected fresh fruit bunch (ffb) production growth of -6.4% in 6mfy15 (versus our projected +3.7% for fy15), a lower price of crude palm oil achieved at rm2,154 per tonne in 6mfy15 (versus our rm2,450 per tonne projection), weaker-than-expected earnings at the heavy equipment and motor units, and some marketing expenses incurred for its battersea property project. it booked a net exceptional gain of rm3 million in the second quarter of fy15 (2qfy15), comprising a gain of rm21 million from a sale of a wave breaker in weifang, china to a joint venture company, and a restructuring expense of rm18 million for its downstream operations. sime declared an interim net dividend per share of six sen. key briefing takeaways: it is cutting its ffb production growth target to 0 from 5% for fy15, the management is rejigging targets for the heavy equipment unit, given the bleak profit contribution, the property unit is still holding up well in 6mfy15, and an update on the acquisition of new britain palm oil ltd (nbpol) was given. lower earnings are expected, moving forward. we cut our earnings for fy15f by 10.3% and for fy16f to fy17f by 2% to 3%, after imputing weaker contributions from the heavy equipment and motor unit, as well as trimming our ffb production target for fy15 to -2% (from +3.7%), while maintaining our 3% to 4% growth rate for fy16f to fy17f. we highlight that we will only impute its proposed nbpol acquisition once completed, which is likely to be by march. this proposed acquisition would be earnings-accretive for sime, potentially adding 3% to 4% per annum to its net earnings. we adjust down our sum-of-parts-based tp to rm8.50 (rm8.75) but keep our neutral recommendation on the stock. although its earnings prospects remain rather subdued, we believe news flow surrounding simes potential restructuring or demerger proposals could provide some support to the companys share price.  rhb research, feb 27   this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on march 2, 2015."}, "225": {"date_posted": "2/3/2015", "title": "is rm3.25 a fair price for integrax?", "article": " kuala lumpur: last wednesday, tenaga nasional bhd (tnb) revealed how serious it was about acquiring integrax bhd. the utility company raised its offer price for the port operator to rm3.25 per share, up 50 sen from its initial bid of rm2.75. the revised offer came on the heels of perak corp bhds (fundamental: 1.9; valuation: 1.2) remark that it would part with its 15.74% equity interest in integrax (fundamental: 1.65; valuation: 0.6) for rm3.25 apiece. however, given the strategic value of lumut port  integraxs core asset  the companys other shareholders may not still consider the higher offer price fair because tnb (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.8) relies solely on the port for the import of coal. in fact, sources familiar with the matter said amin halim rasip, integraxs largest shareholder with a 23.09% stake, is unlikely to accept the offer. if that is the case, tnb may have difficulties in gaining a controlling stake in integrax, let alone take the port operator private. amin, who is deputy chairman of integrax, has vehemently opposed tnbs takeover attempt and rejected its rm2.75 per share offer shortly after it was made. in a circular, integrax noted amins aspirations to grow the company and its port assets, which comprise the lekir bulk terminal (lbt) and the lumut maritime terminal (lmt). tnbs rationale for the privatisation plan is simple. it wants full control of integrax so that it can secure the handling of coal supply to its power plant in janamanjung, perak, which is expected to generate close to a fifth of peninsular malaysias electricity supply by 2017. lbt in lumut currently handles more than seven million tonnes of coal a year. with tnbs manjung 4 coal-fired power plant expected to commence operations this month, another three million tonnes per year will be added to lbts coal throughput. interestingly, tnbs revised offer was announced at the same time as a new 25-year coal-handling contract for the 1,000mw manjung 5 power plant, which begins operations in 2017. rhb research is in favour of the new offer. the revised offer is 32% above our rm2.46 per share valuation of integrax, premised solely on the earnings outlook of tnbs five power plants in manjung and the dividend stream from lmt. the offer also implies a forward earnings multiple of 29 times, which we think is generous, said its analyst ahmad maghfur usman. integraxs minority shareholders may be strongly tempted to sell at rm3.25 as they stand to gain at least 85 sen per share had they bought the stock last year, when it fluctuated between rm1.90 and rm2.40. the company reported a fy2014 net profit of rm38.69 million, down 5.42% from rm40.91 million in fy2013. its current net asset value per share stands at rm2.13, substantially below tnbs offer. some said given lbts crucial position in the handling and delivery of fuel to tnbs power plants, its earnings potential and asset appreciation should fetch a much higher valuation than rm3.25. m&a securities sdn bhd, which is the independent adviser for the deal, has pegged a net asset value per share of rm3.62 to integrax in a feb 16 report. perak corps valuation of integrax came from its own adviser, affin hwang investment bank bhd. the group is expected to hold an extraordinary general meeting (egm) by the end of this month to seek the approval of its shareholders to sell its integrax stake. perak corp will pocket some rm150 million cash if it accepts the revised offer, giving it a net divestment gain of rm52.31 million. in a statement, the minority shareholders watchdog group advised integraxs shareholders to take into account the different valuations in order to make an informed decision. minorities have to decide whether to sell based on their respective risk-reward profiles and investment horizons while also taking into account how they view the prospects for the company. for now, it looks like tnbs priority is to secure perak corps stake, which would lift its shareholding to 38.86%. for the takeover offer to be unconditional, tnb will need to obtain at least 13% of the remaining share base held by integraxs minority shareholders and gain at least 51% control of the port operator. however, it is too early to conclude that perak corp will definitely sell its stake as its board has yet to obtain the approval of its shareholders. it is worth noting that its substantial shareholder, sime darby properties sdn bhd, blocked its privatisation just a few months ago, saying the offer from the perak state development corp was not attractive enough. so, will sime darby play hardball again? this could be interesting to watch. excluding the stakes owned by tnb, perak corp and amin, integraxs share base amounts to some 114 million. a look at the companys top shareholders shows a smattering of fund managers with stakes ranging from 1% to 4%, which could ultimately decide the outcome of tnbs takeover attempt. the closing date for the revised offer is march 31. it is likely that by then, perak corp would have held its egm and made known its acceptance. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers.

conducive for a listing right now. for any listing, it has to achieve the best valuation, he told reporters at sime darbys (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.3) media briefing yesterday on the 2qfy15 financial results. it was reported earlier that the listing of sime darbys automotive arm, which deals with brands such as hyundai, bmw and ford in the region, was scheduled for the first half of this

listing, mergers or reverse takeover. we are working on it, he said. sime darbys net profit fell 47% to rm437.4 million in 2q ended december 2014 from rm818.31 million a year ago due to lower

28.2% to rm938.09 million from rm1.31 billion a year ago, while revenue fell 2% to rm20.87 billion from rm21.29 billion in 1hfy14. despite weaker results, sime darby proposed an interim dividend of six sen for fy15 ending june 30, payable on may 8. bakke said 1hfy15 was challenging, as the sharp decline in crude oil prices and deceleration of global economic growth had resulted in the need for greater productivity and cost efficiency. the groups portfolio of diversified businesses and stringent capital allocation will be crucial in carrying us through this volatility, and the focus is to strive to meet the targets under the key performance indicators (kpis) that we set. we believe long-term market fundamentals remain attractive, despite the easing of commodity prices, he said. he sees

to increase after the payment is done for the acquisition of new britain palm oil ltd (nbpol). the rm5.6 billion acquisition ofnbpol will be funded by debt (80%) and internal funds (20%). she said the comfortable level of the groups debt-equity ratio is from 35% to 45%, adding that the listing of its motor division and indonesian plantation business would help to manage the groups gearing level.

lafarge malaysia bhd (lafarge) reported a 30% drop in net profit to rm256 million for financial year ended dec 31, 2014 (fy14), due to continued price pressures and higher operating costs. meanwhile, revenue of the countrys largest cement producer had eased 4% year-on-year to rm2.7 billion.\n\nin a press statement, lafarge said contribution from the concrete segment increased, but revenue from the cement and aggregate divisions declined due to lower cement prices. meanwhile, operating cost rose due to higher electricity tariff, plant maintenance and higher transport cost. steel products manufacturer, lion corporation bhd, saw its net loss widen to rm123.31 million or 9.37 sen a share in its second quarter ended dec 31, 2014 (2qfy15), from rm33.18 million previously, due to sluggish demand in the domestic steel market. revenue in 2qfy15 also decreased 35.42% to rm474.28 million, from rm734.38 million, its filing with bursa malaysia showed. it said sluggish demand in the domestic steel market is due to rampant dumping activities by foreign steel players, which it said remained a major market disturbance. lion corp said pending the effectiveness of the anti-dumping duty measures by the government, the operating environment for its steel business is expected to remain challenging in the coming quarter. ql resources bhd (ql) saw its net profit for its third quarter

material trade and poultry operations from its integrated livestock farming division. meanwhile, the poultry farmer reported a 10.1% increase in revenue to rm732.82 million in 3qfy15, from rm665.63

year ago, due to foreign exchange (forex) losses and lower net operating profit. airasia (fundamental score: 1.3; valuation score: 1.8) said its net operating profit for 4qfy14 fell 9% to rm109.8 million, due to higher finance costs relating to bank borrowings, as the airline took delivery of new aircraft, as well as to finance its new airasia headquarters at klia2 in sepang. revenue however, climbed 15.8% to rm1.48 billion, from rm1.28 billion in 4qfy13, which it said was because of double-digit growth in both average fare and ancillary income per passenger, which increased 13% and 31% year-on-year respectively. the poor quarterly results dragged airasia's net profit for the full financial year ended dec 31, 2014 (fy14) down 77.1% to rm82.84 million, from rm362.12 million the previous year, despite its revenue climbing 5.9% to rm5.42 billion, from rm5.11 billion in fy13. telekom malaysia bhd (tm) raked in a net profit of rm218.3 million or 5.9 sen per share in its fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2014 (4qfy14), down 36.59% from rm344.24 million or 9.62 sen per share in the previous corresponding period, on the back of higher operating costs and taxation. its revenue during the quarter under review, however, was up 5.96% on-year to rm3.16 billion, from rm2.98 billion, due to higher contributions from its internet and multimedia and data services, its filing today with bursa malaysia, showed. telekom proposed a final dividend of 13.4 sen per share, subject to shareholders' approval at its forthcoming annual general meeting. for its full fy14, telekom's net profit was at rm831.81 million, a decline of 17.82% from rm1.01 billion in fy13  also due to higher operating costs and tax charge  even though revenue came in 5.71% higher at rm11.24 billion, compared to rm10.63 billion previuosly. similarly, telekom said the higher revenue was achieved on the back of higher revenue from internet and multimedia, data and other telecommunication-related services, which was partially offset by lower contribution from voice and non-telecommunication-related services. malayan banking bhds net profit in the fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2014 (4qfy14), increased 12% to rm1.93 billion, from rm1.73 billion a year earlier, on higher net interest, islamic banking and insurance income. revenue came in higher at rm9.66 billion versus rm8.27 billion.

offer for integrax hits a wall", "article": " tenaga nasional bhds plan to take integrax bhd private has hit a snag  the port operators founder cum major shareholder, amin halim rasip, said he will reject the takeover offer of rm2.75 per share. now, the question is, will tenaga raise its offer price to gain full control of lumut port, which takes care of the coal requirements of tenagas power plants nearby. the offer of rm2.75 is already at a premium of 21.7% to the closing price of integrax (fundamental: 1.65; valuation: 0.60) prior to the takeover announcement. at that price, the takeover offer would cost tenaga rm644.23 million, which ram ratings describes as negligible in relation to the utility groups key financial metrics. at press time, tenaga (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.0) did not immediately respond to request for comment by the edge. amin, the single largest shareholder of integrax with 22.81% deemed equity interest (see chart), has now single-handedly blocked the privatisation deal. without his supporting votes, tenaga, which holds a 22.12% stake, would not be able to garner 90% acceptance from the shareholders with non-interested shareholding  equivalent to 77.88% or 234.27 million shares. last friday, amin, who is also the deputy chairman of integrax, said he will not part with his shares at rm2.75 each as the offer price is not fair and not reasonable, noting that tenagas offer does not reflect the value of integrax. there is more value to be gained and i recommend that shareholders reject the tenaga offer [of rm2.75 per share] and, depending on shareholders needs in the near term, hold out for a much higher price and derive significant value and more shareholder benefits for the long term, he said. in the statement, amin said his remarks were made solely based on his capacity as a shareholder and did not represent the views of integraxs board of directors and management. following the opposition, it remains to be seen if tenaga will withdraw its takeover offer as, even if all the remaining shareholders accept the offer, it would not be able to meet its main objective of taking integrax private. so far, the companys third largest shareholder perak corp bhd, which is controlled by perbadanan kemajuan negeri perak (pknp), has yet to reveal its stance on the takeover offer. perak corp (fundamental: 1.9; valuation: 1.2) holds a 15.74% stake in integrax. the state-controlled entity could not be reached for comments. interestingly, pknp  the state government body under the purview of the menteri besar of perak  had just in october last year withdrawn its selective capital reduction (scr) offer to take perak corp private at rm3.90 per share. the withdrawal was made after sime darby property bhd informed the company that it intended to vote against the proposed scr at the extraordinary general meeting. an analyst who tracks integrax says he expects some resistances from pknp and perak corp. they (pknp) want lumut port to play a bigger role in future. their objective is not just making money but also to uplift the social economic growth in perak. the hefty premium price that tenaga is willing to pay seems like an irresistible offer for many minority shareholders, considering that integraxs shares have not been traded at the rm2.75 level in the past 10 years. however, it is still an offer that amin and perak corp can afford to resist. the former is eyeing a deal from vale international sa and is taking integraxs future earnings into consideration. the latter, meanwhile, relies on the port business to provide a stable and consistent income. the cash offer from tenaga values the lumut port owner at a price-to-book value of 1.3 times, as well as a historical price-earnings ratio of 20.2 times, based on integraxs net asset value per share of rm2.09 as at sept 30, 2014, and its earnings per share of 13.6 sen in the financial year ended dec 31, 2013. integrax is a zero gearing and cash rich company. its net cash position stood at rm154.6 million as at sept 30, 2014, with total assets worth rm749.3 million. however, rhb research and kenanga research have advised the minority shareholders of integrax to accept the offer. the deal-breaker could be integraxs possible tie-up with brazilian mining player and logistics operator vale. it is understood that tenaga has always wanted integrax to focus on the utility groups coal requirements for its power plants while the likes of amin and perak corp want integrax to serve vale and other clients. in 1999, lekir bulk terminal (lbt) executed a jetty terminal usage agreement (jtua) with tnb janamanjung sdn bhd for the provision of coal unloading and delivery services to the power station. jtua 2 was signed in 2012 to provide a new additional grab ship unloader for the handling of coal for the manjung 4 power plant, which is scheduled to begin operations in the first quarter of 2015. currently, tenaga is in talks with integrax on jtua 3 for the new manjung 5 power plant. analysts anticipate that the agreement could be secured in 2016, but the earliest contribution from this project is expected to come only in 2018. hong leong investment bank research analyst daniel wong tells the edge that there has always been some disagreement between tenaga and integraxs board on the future planning of the port utilisation at lumut port. if big players such as vale come into the picture, integrax will have to give a high allocation to them (the new customers), he says. to recap, integrax first signed a transhipment agreement with vale in 2009, but it was subsequently scrapped in 2010 when amin and his brother, harun halim rasip, could not agree on how vales iron ore requirements should be handled. eventually, harun resigned as ceo of integrax and sold his 22% stake in the company to tenaga at rm1.60 apiece. in his statement, amin highlighted that integraxs port assets, namely lbt and lumut maritime terminal (lmt), have high enterprise and strategic values, as well as proven track records as catalysts in the growth of peraks resource and industrial base. as a business, we are insulated and not sensitive to commodity price movements as commodities like coal [are still needed] irrespective of commodity prices, amin said. lmt is jointly-controlled by integrax and perak corp, while lbt is 80% owned by integrax.  note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a

"article": " by the look of things, tan sri liew kee sin, the former chief executive of s p setia bhd, may have to relinquish the chairmanship of battersea project holding co ltd (bphcl) before his contract ends in september. this is because the property tycoon is involved in a personal endeavour in london  the development of property projects worth u00a32.2 billion (rm11.8 billion)  which may give rise to conflicts of interest. the projects also pave the way for the listing of liews special-purpose acquisition company (spac) eco world international bhd (ewi) back home. last week, eco world investment co ltd (ew investment), a private vehicle controlled by liew and his long-time partner datuk voon tin yow, announced three large-scale residential projects in central london with a combined gross development value of u00a32.2 billion. ew investment was incorporated in jersey, channel islands, in november last year with liew holding a 70% stake and voon 30%. the latter was the chief operating officer of s p setia during liews tenure as its president and ceo. these mega property projects will be undertaken through eco world ballymore holding co ltd (ecoworld-ballymore), a joint venture between ew investment and ireland-based ballymore group. ew investment will own 75% equity interest in ecoworld-ballymore. to recap, bphcl was set up to undertake the redevelopment of the iconic battersea power station by s p setia (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 1.2), sime darby properties sdn bhd (sd prop) and the employees provident fund (epf). s p setia and sd prop own a 40% stake each in bphcl while the epf owns 20%. now that liew is launching his own projects in london, there are bound to be conflicts of interest if he continues to hold the chairmanship of the battersea project. while his tenure will end in september, he might have to leave sooner ... maybe as early as in the first quarter, says an industry source. analysts, however, point out that it is up to bphcls board to decide whether or not to retain the tycoon as the chairman. im sure the board is aware of his involvement in property development there, says an analyst with a local investment bank. liew had set up ewi after his appointment as non-executive director of eco world development group bhd (fundamental: 0.3; valuation: 0.95), which was to eventually acquire a 30% stake in the spac.  in view of the proposed listing of ewi on bursa malaysia, ew investment is prepared to offer the spac a right of first refusal to acquire its 75% stake in ecoworld-ballymore, says liew in a statement on the investment. this means ewi might be the first property-related spac on the local stock exchange. it will help raise fresh capital for liew to execute his projects in london while eco world will concentrate on the domestic market. while ewi is still awaiting approval for its listing from the regulator, the announcement of the multibillion-ringgit projects by ew investment has got the market talking about its potential. this is because unlike the other spacs on bursa malaysia, ewi will already have a substantial asset base. the other spacs have typically taken between six months and a year post-listing to make a qualifying acquisition. in other words, investors will know what they are buying into in the case of ewi. ecoworld-ballymore will acquire three sites in central london for a total of u00a3428.7 million to develop arrowhead quay in canary wharf, london city island phase 2 on the leamouth peninsula and embassy gardens phase 2 in nine elms. the developer has already secured permission for the planning of embassy gardens and outline planning consent for london city island while a resolution to grant planning consent for arrowhead quay was passed on nov 6 last year. all three projects are expected to be launched this year. the projects, which are situated in geographically diversified growth areas offering differentiated pricing points, present an unrivalled opportunity for ecoworld to introduce its brand name to the greater london market. with our combined and complementary strengths, we believe that the partnership with ballymore group can become a strong platform to grow our presence in the uk property market, says liew in the statement. ballymore group is a property investment and development firm with over 30 years experience in the uk and ireland property markets. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score

valuation: 1.2) has a dividend policy of distributing at least 50% of its net profit, with its dividend of 9.7 sen per share in fy14 accounting for about 60% of its earnings per share. with retained earnings that were four times its fy14 net profit of rm405.68 million and no major land acquisitions announced, the group looks to be able to distribute more dividends, some said. meanwhile, another of pnbs listed conglomerates, sime darby bhd (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.3), has retained earnings of rm28.9 billion, which is 8.59 times its trailing 12-month net profit of rm3.36 billion. in addition, its net gearing level is also low at 0.23 times. sime darby has a pending deal to acquire new britain palm oil ltd for some rm5.63 billion. but after this, analysts dont expect a major acquisition by the group, at least in the short term. nevertheless, weak palm oil prices and the slowdown in its china vehicle distribution business may dent sime darbys profitability and crimp its dividends, some said. alliancedbs research, in a note last friday, said companies owned by khazanah nasional bhd are more likely to be the ones asked to pay more dividends, compared with other glcs that are largely owned by trust funds managed by pnb or the employees provident fund. in 2013, khazanah contributed rm650 million in dividends to the government. this suggests that dividends from khazanah will need to be ramped up significantly in order to achieve the [additional] rm400 million target, said the research house in the note. alliancedbs believes the four glcs that could give out more dividends are axiata group bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 0.9), time dotcom bhd (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 0.6), petronas gas bhd (petgas) (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 0.9), and misc bhd (fundamental: 1.6; valuation: 1.8). axiata and time are majority owned by khazanah, while petgas and misc are majority owned by petronas. based on our analysis, axiata is likely to be the major contributor as it has the capacity to raise its payout ratio from 80% (our current estimate) to 100%, given its strong free cash flow from malaysian operations. if this happens, this will raise rm205 million in additional dividends for khazanah, alliancedbs explained. jf apexs lee, who tracks telecommunications stocks, said telcos will have to balance between dividend payout and allocation for their capex. telcos have high capex commitments because they have to build infrastructure. for telekom malaysia bhd (tm), should it get the governments go-ahead to start its second phase of high-speed broadband this year, its cash might be constrained by the huge capex, he said. like axiata, tm is majority owned by khazanah. telcos are seen as dividend-seekers favourites due to their stable earnings and generous payout ratios, although currently their yields are in the range of just 4%. khazanah owns 28.73% of tm (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 0.9) and 37.89% of axiata. in the past four financial quarters, tm paid out a dividend of 25.8 sen per share, which is nearly 97% of its earnings per share of 26.61 sen in the same period. currently, tm has a policy of paying out either rm700 million or a maximum of 90% of its net profit, whichever is higher. either way, tms dividend payout has a limit and is constrained by its performance. back to petronas-owned listed companies, while they might be facing earnings headwinds given the depressed crude oil prices, they are lowly geared. two of them, petgas and petronas chemicals group bhd (pchem), are in net cash positions. however, alliancedbs said that both petgas and pchem (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 1.2) might be constrained by capex requirements for the pengerang regasification terminal project and the refinery and petrochemical integrated development. while no glc has come out since to declare bumper dividends or bigger payouts, many of the blue-chips have seen their share prices move up. between last tuesday and friday, axiata rose 22 sen or 3.15% to rm7.21; sime darby gained 27 sen or 2.91% to rm9.56; petronas dagangan bhd jumped 86 sen or 5.27% to rm17.18; and petgas, meanwhile, rose 96 sen or 4.49% to rm22.36. tenaga nasional bhd (tnb), majority owned by khazanah, was also instrumental in lifting the benchmark index back to the 1,800 level last week. save for last tuesday, the utility giant was consistently in the top gainers rank and it closed the week 60 sen or 4.14% higher to record a fresh high of rm15.10. while tnb (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1) has reported a 34% jump in its net profit for the first quarter ended nov 30, 2014 and is expected to deliver record earnings due to lower coal cost and a tariff hike last year, analysts said it might be needing cash for its new power plants, hence potentially capping its dividend payout.  \nthe edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers. a score of 3 suggests strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. go to theedgemarkets.com for more details on a companys financial dashboard. \nthis article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on january 26, 2015."}, "238": {"date_posted": "20/1/2015", "title": " plantation blue chips mixed after mpob says gni target a tall order", "article": " kuala lumpur (jan 20): plantation blue chip stocks were mixed in morning trades after the malaysian palm oil board (mpob) said the palm oil sector's target contribution to gross national income (gni) of rm178 billion by 2020 looked like a tall order. according to the mpob, the industry still has a long way to go before it can achieve the very high gni contribution target under the governments economic transformation programme. as at 11.39 am today, felda global ventures holdings bhd (fgv) slid 2 sen or 0.9% to rm2.14 on trades of 509,900 shares. it had earlier fallen to a low of rm2.13. sime darby bhd fell 4 sen or 0.4% to rm9.26 on trades of 721,200 shares. ioi corp bhd also declined 3 sen or 0.6% to rm4.67 on trades of some 1.1 million shares. it had earlier fallen to a low of rm4.64. however, kuala lumpur kepong bhd (klk) rose 8 sen or 0.4% to rm22.08 on trades of 105,100 shares. ppb group bhd also gained 4 sen or 0.3% to rm14.04 on trades of 94,800 shares. genting plantations bhd (genp) climbed 22 sen or 2% to rm10.32 with 1,100 shares changed hands. in a note today, kenanga research maintained a \"neutral\" call on the sector on limited near-term catalysts. the research house pointed out a possible weak el nino and lacklustre biodiesel demand would limit immediate crude palm oil (cpo) price upside. kenangas research analysts voon yee ping and sarah lim expect cpo prices in the second half this year to weaken on production recovery. kenanga retained sime darby (fundamental: 1.3;

production from some of the estates impacted by the floods. as such, this news is negative for planters that are impacted by the floods. among the planters under our coverage, fgv currently has the highest proportion (67%) of estates located in the nine states that are reportedly hit by the floods. sime darby, ioi corp and klk have around 26% to 29% of their total oil palm estates located in these states, followed by genting plantations bhd with 14%, she said, maintaining a neutral rating on the plantation sector. ng said it is early days to assess the exact impact of the flooding on cpo output as this will be dependent on the severity and length of the ongoing monsoon. it was reported that the malaysian palmoilassociation had forecast cpo production to fall 21% in the dec 1 to 20 period compared with a month ago. onsept 2, cpo price hit its lowest in five years to rm1,914 per tonne, resulting in the government stepping in to temporarily waive the export levy until december, which has since been extended to end-february next year. since the temporary suspension, prices have rebounded. bloomberg reported that prices entered a bullish market onnov 3, after they rose more than 20% from rm1,929 per tonne onaug 29. low crude oil prices are unlikely to dent cpo prices, said malaysian palm oil council (mpoc) chairman datuk lee yeow chor as demand for food outweighs the effects of low crude oil prices. brentoilfell to a 5u00bd-year low under us$57 (rm199.50) per barrel yesterday as persistent worries about a global supply glut offset concerns about output disruptions inlibya. a lot of people put an emphasis on crude oil prices when analysing cpo prices. but the fact is only about 3% of global production of cpo is used for biodiesel, he told the edge financial daily. so the sharply lower price of crude oil will not be a major determining factor for palm oil price, he said. lee, who is ioi corp chief executive officer, foresees cpo prices rallying at rm2,500 per tonne next year due to favourable supply fundamentals for cpo prices. we think after january and february onwards supply fundamentals will be favourable to cpo prices. demand has been very resilient for food, he said. a lot depends on the supply [of cpo]. we expect the palm oil stock to decrease in the coming months and more sharply in january and february, he said, adding that factors affecting palm oil output include the current heavy rainfall in the east coast. lee does not expect the implementation of the goods and services tax (gst) at 6% in april next year to affect the malaysian palm oil industry as close to 90% of the supply is exported, which entails a zero rate. there will be additional administrative costs, maybe, but otherwise, the gst has minimal impact on the industry, he said. on government policies that may affect the industry, uncertainties over the proposed capping of foreign ownership to 30% in indonesian plantation companies may deter oil palm plantation companies from expanding in indonesia, jf apex securities bhd research analyst jessica low jze tieng said. she said the proposed policy is unlikely to be revived if newly-elected indonesian president joko widodo, popularly known as jokowi, intends to encourage foreign direct investment in the country. the proposed policy has led to the outcry from plantation companies and we see that the uncertainties may lead to the expansion in indonesia of plantation companies being put on hold, she told the edge financial daily via email. in our view, we think that the proposed policy is unlikely to be resuscitated if the newly- elected jokowi is to encourage foreign direct investment in the country. a bill calling for foreign ownership to be limited to 30% in plantations had been mooted in the indonesian parliament. upon opposition from foreign plantation business owners, the bill was passed on sept 29 this year without the proposed limitation of foreign ownership. the new policy, however, requires indonesian plantation firms to allocate 20% of their concessions to local residents. it also stipulates that the firms help local smallholders who own plantations and companies be given five years to comply with the new ruling. low said the research firm is expecting cpo prices to hit rm2,400 per tonne by year-end and to climb up further to rm2,500 per tonne in the first quarter of 2015. this is expected to be due to the low production season coupled with an increased demand for palm oil during the chinese new year, she said. low said the research house anticipates a lower-than-expected cpo production in the coming months as the lagged impact of a dry spell in the first quarter of 2014 would hit production. cpo production in the first half of 2015 (1h15) may come under pressure on lagged impact of the drought in 2014, she said. she also said that the shortage of labour remains a challenge in the plantations sector as the booming economy in indonesia and the competitive plantations industry there had resulted in fewer foreign workers being able to work in malaysia. the effect is intensified as there has been no concrete solution in addressing the labour issue, she added. jf apexs top pick in the industry is genting plantations.  this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on december 31, 2014."}, "245": {"date_posted": "11/12/2014",

added that the results also showed a clear drop in productivity, where fgvh reduced its total palm fresh fruit bunch (ffb) production by 1% in the 9-months of 2014, despite having added about 5% of additional mature palm oil area from the rm1.2 billion acquisition of pontian united plantations last year. pua said fgvh blamed the decline in productivity on the lower rainfall, but added that the

damning, where the bank downgraded the stock from a hold to a sell. pua said in october, the ministry of finance had responded to his question of the increasingly weak financial performance by fgvh by attributing it entirely to the falling commodity prices. but, he added that he said in october if the terrible performance of fgvh was solely attributable to crude palm oil prices, then all other

he urged fgvh chairman tan sri isa samad and the top management to take collective responsibility of the company's declining results. he added that this was especially so since fgvh in its 2012 annual

industry bhd, i-bhd, and k-star sports ltd. telco giant maxis bhd saw a 5% on-year fall in its net profit to rm449 million for the third quarter ended sept 30, 2014 (3qfy14), from rm472 million as revenue from prepaid and wireless broadband subscriptions, besides voice and sms usage, declined. downward re-pricing of its postpaid charges also curbed profit growth, maxis told bursa malaysia today. revenue for the quarter under review was also down at rm2.07 billion compared to rm2.24 billion in 3qfy13. maxis declared an eight sen interim tax-exempt dividend for 3qfy14. maxis shares will trade ex-dividend this november 26. for the nine months, maxis net profit declined to rm1.38 billion from rm1.48 billion a year earlier while revenue fell to rm6.23 billion from rm6.86 billion. looking ahead, maxis ceo morten lundal said in a separate statement that the company, which invested a total of rm337 million for capex during 3qfy14, was on track to spend more than rm1 billion

against rm3.68 million in the previous corresponding quarter, as a result of stronger sales growth and an improvement in operation efficiency. its revenue for 1qfy15 had also improved by 18% to rm43.74 million, from rm37.1 million the year before, due to positive sales growth contribution from both the courier and logistics services, which reflects a continuance of strong support from new and existing customers. the group also achieved an improvement in earnings per share (eps) of 0.59 sen in 1qfy15, as compared to 0.47 sen in the same period a year ago. gdex share price has staged a strong rebound, after the heavy sell down across the global stock markets last month. the stock bounced back from recent low of rm1.70 to rm2.12 today, with a market capitalisation of rm1.78 billion. palm oil conglomerate sime darby bhd's proposed privatisation of plantation firm new britain palm oil ltd (nbpol) may not materialise after the papua new guinea (png) government indicated its intention to up its stake in nbpol to 30%. the png government currently holds an 18% stake in the png-based oil palm planter. according to sime darby president and group chief executive tan sri mohd bakke salleh, the png government intends to increase its stake in nbpol from 18% to 30%. bakke said the move was good for sime darby, which could still end up with a controlling 51% stake in nbpol. sime darby shares fell one sen or 0.1% to rm9.60 todsay, valuing the company at rm58.22 billion. econpile holdings bhd (econpile) has secured a rm30 million substructure works contract for a condominium development project in kuala lumpur from crcc malaysia bhd. in a filing with bursa malaysia, the piling and foundation specialist said its wholly owned subsidiary, econpile (m) sdn bhd (emsb) has received the letter of award from crcc. the contract comprises bored piling, earthworks and basement substructure works of a condominium development project, for a contract sum of approximately rm30 million, said econpile. the duration of the contract is 14 months and the company is expected to complete the job in january 2016. econpiles share price closed at 96 sen today, down 1.5 sen. listed on june 30, 2014, the company has a market capitalisation of rm518.95 million. little known canned food manufacturer rex industry bhd share price jumped as much as 7.3%, or eight sen, to an intra-day high of rm1.18 shortly before the closing bell for the morning session. the stock retreated to close at rm1.16 today with only 52,000 shares changing hands, giving it a market capitalisation of rm65.02 million. rex is featured as \"stocks with momentum on theedgemarkets.com today. the company, which specialises in the manufacturing of halal canned foods, frozen foods and beverages, has seen a slew of changes on substantial shareholders. the shareholding changes seem to suggest the elder shareholders are passing the baton to the younger generation. in terms of earnings, the penang-based manufacturer recorded a net profit of rm568,000, for its third quarter ended sep 30, 2014(3qfy14), signifying a 88% jump in net profits against rm301,000 recorded in 3qfy13. its revenue however slipped by 3% to rm39.68 million in 3qfy14, as compared to rm40.88 million a year ago. i-bhds net profit for the quarter ended sept 30, 2014 (3qfy14) leaped to rm14.23 million from rm2.68 million in the previous corresponding quarter, due to higher recognition from project completion and sales. quarterly revenue doubled to rm77.39 million, from rm35.54 million in the same period a year ago; pre-tax profit was also significantly higher at rm17.42 million against rm3.69 million, its filing to bursa malaysia today read. earnings per share (eps) surged to 6.23 sen for the quarter

double to rm192.95 million, from rm96.49 million a year ago. the property developer attributed the improved earnings to higher percentage of recognition for both the project completion and sales for i-residence, i-sovo, i-soho and i-suites projects. \"baring any unforeseen circumstances and based on the aforementioned factors, the board is confident that it would achieve better operating results for the financial year ending dec 31, 2014,\" it added. i-bhd closed 1 sen higher at 72.5 sen, giving it a market capitalisation of rm507.39 million. k-star sports ltd has narrowed its net loss by 83% to rm5.5 million in the third quarter ended sept 30, 2014 (3qfy14), from rm32.9 million in the previous corresponding quarter. the smaller loss came on a stable overall gross profit margin, as its average selling price and production costs saw no major fluctuation, said the sports footwear firm in a filing with bursa malaysia today. revenue rose 7.7% to rm43.3 million, from rm40.2 million a year earlier. k-star said sales of dixing brand footwear has improved, but sales of original equipment manufacturer products and apparel have deteriorated. for the nine-month period (9mfy14), net loss

nbpol?", "article": " the papua new guinea (png) government has given sime darby bhds proposal to acquire new britain palm oil ltd (nbpol) its blessing. the question is, will kulim (m) bhd, which will be selling its 49% stake in the papuan palm oil producer, distribute all the proceeds from the disposal to its shareholders? last thursday, sime darby surprised the market by announcing that its subsidiary, sime darby plantation sdn bhd, intends to make a cash offer of u00a37.15 apiece for all the voting shares in nbpol. note that this was just a week after sime darby said it was not proceeding with the acquisition following the expiry of the exclusivity period agreed between the parties. given that kulim had previously distributed the entire rm1.16 billion proceeds from the disposal of its stake in qsr brands bhd and kfc (m) holdings bhd, the market appears to believe it will do the same this time around. kulims shares rose 4.62% to close at rm3.40 last friday. however, an midf research analyst opines that kulim needs to hold on to some of the proceeds to expand its businesses, especially in the plantation segment. this is because the disposal of nbpol will leave a big hole in kulims future earnings. kulim needs to use the proceeds for capital expenditure. it needs to keep some of the money to expand its plantation business because nbpol contributes a huge part of the segments profit, the analyst tells the edge. kulims plantation businesses in png and the solomon islands contribute about 30% to the segments operating profit. the operating profit of the plantation segment is bigger than the groups total operating profit (see table). in 2013, nbpol contributed 70% and 65% of kulims fresh fruit bunches (ffb) and crude palm oil (cpo) production  kulim produced 563,984 tonnes of ffb and 180,664 tonnes of cpo. the planned divestment of nbpol may significantly affect kulims plantation performance as 65% of the groups ffb production was contributed by the operation in png and the solomon islands. if the sale of nbpol goes through, we expect kulims earnings growth in the near term to be muted, states midf research in a sept 19 report. the research house says that part of the proceeds from the nbpol sale will be utilised to finance the development of the newly acquired 40,645ha greenfield plantation land in central kalimantan, indonesia. kulim targets to plant 400ha by end of this year, notes midf research. however, as the central kalimantan land is a greenfield project, kulim will not reap much from it for at least the next two to three years. thus, kulim needs to find a way to plug the hole if it wants to maintain its level of earnings, says the analyst with midf research. nevertheless, others expect kulim to distribute the entire proceeds to its shareholders. this is because its largest shareholder, johor corp bhd (jcorp), with a 60.3% stake, would want the proceeds to be distributed so that it can pare down its debts. while jcorp has a large portfolio of assets, it also has huge debts. besides qsr and kfc, jcorp owns stakes in damansara realty bhd, kpj healthcare bhd, damansara assets sdn bhd, johor land bhd and tanjung langsat port sdn bhd, among others. as at dec 31, 2013, jcorp had rm8.63 billion of property, plant and equipment, rm3.55 billion in investment properties and rm1.27 billion of investment in joint ventures. the group had cash and bank balances amounting to rm1.11 billion last year. on the other side of the balance sheet, short and long-term borrowings stood at rm1.63 billion and rm6.93 billion respectively. another analyst says he sees the likelihood of the proceeds from the sale of nbpol to be distributed to kulims shareholders via a special dividend, amounting to about rm2.20 per share. recall that kulim paid a special dividend of 93 sen when it disposed of its stake in qsr and kfc in 2012, he says. the analyst points out that if kulim needs to acquire new assets or businesses to plug the hole left by nbpol, the group could easily raise the funds. as at june 30, 2014, kulims gearing stood at 37.7%. it had cash and bank balances of rm248.9 million as at june 30, 2014, while total loans and borrowings stood at rm2.03 billion. however, its borrowings are also expected to go down, as about 40% of the total was nbpols debts. besides its plantation business, kulim also has shipping and oil and gas-related businesses. the proposed listing of its shipping arm, ea technique (m) bhd, could provide greater financial flexibility for kulim to pursue its investment strategy, says midf research. while it will be good news for kulims shareholders if the group decides to distribute the proceeds from the sale of nbpol, there is a chance it may not do so, or may not distribute the entire amount to shareholders. if the latter happens, it will be hard to justify the almost 5% jump in kulims share price last friday, notes the analyst with midf research. nbpol deal long-term positive for sime darby sime darby bhd has made an offer of u00a37.15 (rm37.34) per share for new britain palm oil ltd (nbpol). sime darbys offer is said to be around 10% higher than that of the other bidders, say sources. the question is whether sime darby will be overpaying for the acquisition, at an 85% premium of nbpols closing price of u00a33.87 per share traded on the london stock exchange (lse) on oct 8, the last trading day before the announcement. according to maybank investment bank research, the quality of nbpols assets and management, scarcity of landbank, and the high cost and high risk of greenfield development, led to the proposed acquisition. besides being 100% certified as a sustainable palm oil producer by the roundtable of sustainable palm oil (rspo), nbpol will provide a gateway for sime darbys expansion into papua new guinea (png), says the investment bank.  the government of png has stated its intention to hold a 30% stake in nbpol, pursuant to the privatisation of the company off the lse. nbpol will be relisted on either bursa malaysia or the singapore exchange. the offer price translates to an earning value per mature hectare (ev per ha) of rm84,200, or about a 15% premium to recent transactions in malaysia. on its short term financial impact, we are neutral to slight negative on the acquisition. the ev per ha of rm84,200 is the highest offered for a listed entity so far. just last month, felda global ventures holdings bhds offer for asia plantations ltd worked out to an ev per ha of rm75,000, according to cimb investment bank research. it is worth noting that nbpols estates recorded an average fresh fruit bunch yield of 23.5 tonnes per ha and an oil extraction rate of 22.5% over the past five years, which is superior to most of its peers, added cimb in a report last friday. we are long term positive on the deal given the potential synergies and opportunities in papua new guinea for future expansion. sime darby gains an immediate foothold in this new market [with the acquisition], says maybank ib. nbpol has over 78,000ha of planted oil palm plantations with a further 10,000ha for future planting, over 7,700ha of sugar cane plantations, and more than 9,000ha of grazing pasture. the company also owns 12 mills and two refineries in png and in liverpool, in the uk. another analyst opines that the acquisition will have minimal earnings impact on sime darby. he estimates an almost zero earnings accretion after taking into account the loss of interest income from the internal funds utilised for the acquisition and additional borrowing costs. [sime darbys] management has provided guidance of 4% to 5% accretion in two years, based on a cpo (crude palm oil) price assumption of us$800 per tonne or approximately rm2,600 per tonne. we believe upside would come from landbank expansion in papua new guinea or synergies extracted from the exercise, says the analyst. nevertheless, nbpols liverpool refinery will complement sime darbys existing downstream business in europe, said uob kayhian in a research note last friday. the liverpool refinery supplies about 95% of traceable sustainable palm oil to the uk market with good premium pricing. the uk is a totally new market for sime darby as it only has one refinery in the netherlands, it wrote. with the liverpool refinery, sime darbys total capacity in the region will increase to 750,000 tonnes per annum, said the research firm. the traceability of nbpols palm oil products as sustainable is also good branding for sime darby to capture the european market, it added.  by kamarul azhar

looked at your pay cheque and wonder if you are being paid enough? are you underpaid for the amount of work that you do? or, might you even be overpaid for doing what an intern can manage? unfortunately, there are no simple answers to these questions. and, there are no formulas that can calculate what a fair wage is. salary comparisons are relative on so many different levels. on a macro level, ones salary depends on the country you work in, the health of the economy, the industrys landscape as well as the size and type of company you work for. there are also demand and supply forces at play. on a more personal level, it depends on your qualifications, skills and experience as well as employee benefits and career development opportunities. also, how well you have negotiated your remuneration package. to find out how much others are getting paid for doing the same job, the simplest way is to ask your peers, both in and outside your organisation. nevertheless, some people are uncomfortable in disclosing how much they earn. if you fail to get answers this way, try these other methods to get an estimate of how much you could be earning. this week, #edgy searched for salary reports, websites and apps to satisfy that curiosity. app/report:\nthe robert walters salary checker\nglobal recruitment company robert walters has a nifty mobile app, called salary checker 2014, which is free and available on the app store and google play. the data is based on its comprehensive global salary survey 2014 report and saves you the trouble of going through the 499-page document. the app allows users to select their country of workplace from a list of 25 nations and two regions  the middle east and sub-saharan africa. malaysia is among the countries listed, alongside the likes of hong kong, australia, singapore, the us, the uk and indonesia. this is useful if your present job is in the corporate sector. there are only seven industries or specialisms listed: accounting and finance, banking and financial services, human resources, information technology, legal and compliance, sales and marketing, and supply chain and engineering. some specialisms allow users to specify their expertise, sector and job title. using this app, we tried to look up the salary comparisons for an auditor in kuala lumpur. the app displays a simple bar chart of the annual salaries in ringgit for an auditor over three years. for 2014, the app tells us that an auditor typically earns between rm48,000 and rm102,000 a year. thats a significant jump from the rm48,000 to rm88,000 range for 2012 and 2013. this app gives a quick overview of the salary ranges for specific jobs in certain industries in different countries. data source is important and we take comfort in the comprehensive global survey as its base. but where the app disappoints is that it does not allow for deeper customisation based on years of experience, size of organisation, bonus and other employee benefits. app/report:\nhays apac salary guide\nrecruitment specialist hays publishes an annual salary guide that is easily the most comprehensive around. various industries are covered in this report: accountancy and finance; banking; construction, architecture and engineering; contact centres; education; energy; healthcare; human resources; information technology; insurance; legal; life sciences; logistics manufacturing and operations; office support; oil and gas; policy and strategy; procurement; property and facility management; resources and mining; retail; and sales and marketing. hays has also made it easier to browse its salary guide by offering a free mobile app for ios devices. the apps interface is simple to use and covers a wide breadth of industries across asia. users can find out typical salaries by selecting the country, industry, sector and position. malaysia is one of the countries included in this report and app. for those without apple devices, there is a full report available for free download upon request. the report offers country-specific salary and recruitment trends for each of the industries. what is most valuable are the in-depth average salary listings for specific jobs and specialities, seniority and size of company (smes, mid-size and multinationals). for example, the report shows that a senior associate or assistant manager of audit in malaysia typically earns rm72,000 to rm108,000 a year while a senior manager takes home between rm144,000 and rm204,000 in 2014. at a glance, readers can see what a similar executive in hong kong, japan and singapore can earn. website:\nglassdoor\nglassdoor is a us-based job listing site that allows employees to anonymously review their employers, salaries and interview process. it was the glimpse into other peoples salaries that generated a lot of buzz and controversy when glassdoor was launched in june 2007. the site has gained traction in the us, but not quite in asia. nevertheless, international expansion is on the cards. users in malaysia might be pleased to know that data has been submitted for 3,849 salaries and 1,900 companies. the catch is that users have to sign up for a free account or log in via their facebook or google accounts to view the full list of salaries. once you get past that, you will find glassdoors salary information rather fascinating and useful as a guide. but be mindful that glassdoor does not verify the submissions as the information is volunteered by its users. at a click, users can see the different salaries for different jobs in many big companies. these include the big four accounting firms, major telecommunications companies, banks, national oil company petroliam nasional bhd, intel corp, bursa malaysia, genting group, sime darby and starbucks. there are a lot of details in the salary reviews: they tell you the company, role, average salary and the pay range for a certain job. it also shows the number of employees at that level who have submitted information to generate what is displayed on glassdoor. for example, glassdoor claims that in malaysia, a senior associate in audit at pricewaterhousecoopers earns an average of rm52,905 a year, although it can range from rm40,000 to rm70,000 a year. this works out to rm4,221 a month, but at that level, salaries can range from rm3,300 to rm5,000. it also shows that the average senior associate at pwc gets a bonus of about rm8,000 a year. apart from salaries and bonuses, there are options for reviewers to disclose their stock bonus and profit-sharing, if applicable. website:\npayscale.com\nover the last 12 years, payscale.com has been gathering and evaluating data on job market compensation. unlike glassdoor, payscale does not just rely on reviews. there is a methodology to it. payscale starts with its salary survey for people who are weighing up a job offer, evaluating their current salary or researching other jobs. data from each survey is cleansed, analysed and run through its marketmatch algorithm to make compensation predictions for individuals based on different factors. the data-crunching capabilities and salary survey reports are what makes payscale such a useful resource for jobseekers. this survey saves you the trouble of browsing through lots of salary listings. but it does take a good 15 minutes to answer several questions about your current earnings, what your role entails, how many people you manage, the employee benefits and leave days entitled and your qualifications. payscale promises that its salary report compares your pay cheque with that of other people with similar education, skills and experience. it will tell you exactly where you stand on the scale and advise you on how to move up the ranks, perhaps by moving to another city or gunning for a promotion or personal improvement. beware, though. this survey only works if you are having a job that other people are likely to have. otherwise, you will come to the end of the survey with no report shown. this article first appeared in #edgy, the edge malaysia weekly, on october 13 - 19, 2014."}, "255":

will still be renovation costs, but to a lesser extent. however, a strong y-o-y pick-up should be seen in 4qfy14, particularly since 4qfy13 had been a weak quarter. property management income has thus

"}, "268": {"date_posted": "14/10/2014", "title": "cpo export tax exemption may be extended", "article": " the ministry of plantation industries and commodities (mpic) is understood to be looking into extending the exemption of export duty on crude palm oil for november and december. industry sources say the ministry is preparing a paper to justify the extension to be presented to the cabinet. when contacted, a ministry official says he could neither confirm nor deny that the tax exemption will be extended beyond october. earlier this month, on sept 4, minister datuk amar douglas uggah embas announced that effective sept 1, cpo exporters were exempted from export duty until october. this is part of the governments efforts to mitigate declining cpo prices by bringing down the stocks of the commodity in the country. earlier, the cpo export duty for this month had been gazetted at 4.5%, based on the average prices over 30 days in the previous two months. we understand that the ministry is preparing a justification for extending the exemption, says an industry player from the refining sector, adding however that he is unaware what the justification might be. cpo stocks rose to a 17-month high of 2.05 million tonnes in august, rising 23% from the previous month due to higher than expected production of fresh fruit bunches (ffb). in august, ffb production rose 22% to a monthly high of 2.03 million tonnes. the low cpo price and high inventory led to the governments move to exempt export duty on the commodity for september and october. the minister said the exemption from duties is expected to raise palm oil exports by 600,000 tonnes over the two months and reduce stock levels to 1.6 million tonnes by the end of the year. the tax exemption, if extended, should be positive for cpo prices. since the announcement by the ministry on sept 4, prices have improved, with the third month benchmark rebounding from its year-low of rm1,926 on aug 29 to last fridays close of rm2,111 per tonne.   however, the exemption is expected to have a negative impact on palm oil refiners, more so the independent ones than the integrated players as they lose their competitiveness to their indonesian counterparts with more oil leaving the country. malaysia has more refining capacity than the cpo it produces. last year, malaysian oil palm estates produced 19.2 million tonnes of cpo compared to refining capacity of around 26 million tonnes, which works out to a utilisation rate of about 74% if all the oil were refined locally.  according to industry sources, local refineries need to achieve a utilisation rate of at least 60% to stay in business as margins dip into the red below this level. on average, up to august this year, malaysian refineries achieved a utilisation rate of around 64%, those in the industry say. when contacted, integrated plantation player sime darby bhd says its refineries have yet to be negatively impacted by the tax exemption on cpo export for september as stock levels are still high. in the next few weeks however, as the cpo stock decreases, it will eventually affect our refineries, says its spokesperson. sime darby has refining capacity of 1.5 million tonnes per year in malaysia compared with its cpo production of 1.4 million tonnes in its fiscal year to june 2013. we rely on third-party suppliers in locations where there is insufficient cpo supply, the spokesperson says, adding that sime darby does not have a tax-free export quota. the government scrapped the tax-free quota in 2013 when it implemented a new tax structure for cpo exports. the situation may not be all bleak for local refiners, however, if indonesia follows suit by slashing its export tax to zero for october. if international cpo prices fall below us$750 per tonne, the indonesian export tax will be automatically cut to zero. the cpo price in indonesia was us$730 last friday.  for september, indonesia has set the cpo export tax at 9%. the monthly rate is set using both global and local cpo prices on the first 20 days of the previous month. based on the current cpo export price, on cif rotterdam basis, i wont be surprised if indonesia announces zero tax for cpo in october. in fact, the industry is already expecting it, says the industry player. he adds that if indonesia follows suit in announcing zero cpo export tax in october, it will be a level playing field for malaysia, which will be positive for local refiners. in fact, if indonesia announces the zero cpo export tax in november and december 2014, it will also be good for our local refiners, he says. cpo inventory in indonesia, the worlds largest producer, may have surged to a 15-month high in august due to rising production and reduced demand from importers. inventories jumped 24% to 2.5 million tonnes from 2.02 million tonnes in july, according to a survey by bloomberg. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on september 22-28, 2014."}, "269":

according to president and group chief executive officer tan sri mohd bakke salleh. the ipo will most likely involve its automobile division, he added. it was previously reported that the potential ipo was estimated to raise some us$500 million (rm1.62 billion). mohd bakke said the group is looking to fund the buy with external borrowings (80%) and internally-generated funds (20%). the raising of funds via the ipo will help manage the groups gearing level. our gearing ratio is 38% as at june this year. with this acquisition, at least by the end of next [calendar] year, our gearing will

price on the london stock exchange (lse) on wednesday and a 55.7% premium to the volume weighted average closing price over the last 60 days, as fair. it may appear high but due to the illiquid nature of nbpols shares on the lse and the png port moresby stock exchange  with average trading volume representing less than 0.5% of the public float  the current price is not necessarily reflective of the companys value, said mohd bakke. the offer price, which stood at the higher end of analysts estimates, values nbpol at about rm84,000 on an enterprise value per ha. decreasing crude palm oil and palm kernel oil prices have dragged down nbpols performance recently, with profit before tax dropping from us$275.5 million in financial year 2011 (fy11) to us$17.3 million in fy13. nonetheless, mohd bakke

gains on tuesday driven by speculation that the us federal reserve will be less hawkish on the monetary outlook which is due to be released this wednesday. she said the s&p 500 and djia added 14.85

will give forward guidance on this given the strength of economic indicators of late especially when inflation and unemployment rate have touched their self-imposed target. notwithstanding that, rosnani said she did not think that the fed would be hasty in throwing in their opinion in this especially when they need to make sure that the trend is solid enough before calling in their shot. hence, we agree that the us fed will be less hawkish on the monetary outlook which will be good for the global equity market, she said. on another note, rosnani said malaysia would also be issuing its latest policy decision tomorrow and we believe that monetary stance will not be changed especially when ipi and export growth have been quite weak in july. we could be risking these indicators performance should policy rate get tightened further. malaysia also will be announcing its latest cpi numbers today which we think will still be elevated. as for today, we think that the local market

135 acres of land in elmina west for rm239.8 million. the 135 acres is part of a 5,000-acre land, earmarked for the city of elmina commercial and residential township project. e&o shares rose by as

gain, e&o was the fourth biggest gainer on bursa malaysias. in a note to client thursday, amresearch reaffirmed its rating on the counter with an unchanged fair value (fv) of rm4.00 per share, based on a 15% discount to net asset value (nav) of rm4.73 per share. \"our nav model is based on a conservative assumed land value of rm250psf for sri tanjung pinang 2 (stp2) (project in penang), and has yet to capture any development profits from stp2,\" said amresearch analyst tan ee zhio. \"we are unmoved by the share price retracement from its peak of rm3.18/share in july. our conversations with

reclamation of stp2, and the calling of tender is expected to take place by november. \"we also acknowledged that e&o will call for an extraordinary general meeting (egm) on sept 19, for shareholders to decide on the proposed acquisition of 135 acres of land at elmina west, for rm239 million from sime darby,\" he added. to recap, e&os entry cost for elmina west is rm41psf (including conversion premium), comprising land cost of rm33psf and infrastructure cost of rm8psf. tan said: \"this is viewed as fair, given that land prices within the vicinity are transacted at above rm100psf (kwasa

e&o is trading at a steep discount of 42% vis-a-vis its nav. \"we believe this is unjustified, given more nav upside from stp2 and its increasing presence within the klang valley,\" he said. according

in indonesia over the next three years. we are raising our fy03/15-16 net profit forecasts by 5.3% and 12% respectively, largely to account for higher ffb yield and lower production cost assumptions

the p3 alliance on june 17 as it thinks the proposed vessel-pooling accord will restrict competition on the busiest asia-europe routes. the p3 members (maersk, msc and cma cgm) have announced that the p3 plan will now be scrapped. despite its solid earnings delivery and strong non-p3 volume growth, westports share price performance has been lacklustre since its listing in october 2013 because of concerns about p3. given the latest development, we believe westports will see an overdue re-rating. it trades at an implied forward per of 18 times, below its regional peers average of 22 times. we

per share of 7 sen, in line with our forecast. we think that top glove has been able to contain its operating costs quite well through aggressive cost-optimisation initiatives. this can be seen from the stronger ebitda margin, although it was impacted by the large foreign exchange loss in 9mfy14. the higher ebitda margin was also driven by higher sales contribution from nitrile. sapurakencana

darby sold off its malaysian power plant in april for rm300 million in a bid to dispose of its non-core assets. we maintain our sum-of-parts (sop)-based fair value of rm10.40 and our neutral recommendation. although we are still positive on the plantation sector as a whole, the weaknesses at sime darbys heavy equipment and motor division could be a threat to earnings growth, despite its sensitivity to crude palm oil (cpo) prices. hence, we advocate shifting away from the more integrated players to the purer planters, which would benefit more significantly from cpo price movements.

the offer will fortify scable as the leading cable manufacturer in the country with an estimated market share of more than 50%. we understand that following the acquisition, scable will essentially supply all the cables for the 500kv job on a consolidated basis. the acquiree companies are two of the top suppliers in peninsular malaysia. margins are likely to be similar with that of scables

management. management is striving to achieve key performance indicators for fy15 by replicating fy14s loan growth of 14.1% y-o-y in fy15e, and achieving a higher return on equity of above 14% in

13.5% y-o-y versus hlibs forecasted +12.8% y-o-y for fy14. klia experienced a decrease of -11% on china sector routes alone (about 10% of the overall passenger movement) after the mh370 and kidnapping of chinese incidents. we believe mas as the main airline operator in klias main terminal building (-3.2% y-o-y in may) severely affected mahb. since mid-may, local airlines  mas, airasia group

hold ta securities research (march 24): in 3qfy14, united malacca reported a second consecutive recovery in earnings, which were in line with our expectations. on a quarterly basis, earnings were boosted by higher realised crude palm oil (cpo) prices and a lower effective tax rate, although the impact was partially offset by a 7.4% contraction in fresh fruit bunch (ffb) harvest. despite having relatively young estates, ffb yield was negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions. we understand that fy14 ffb harvest is likely to be flat or slightly more on a y-o-y basis. we have assumed lower ffb yield and revised downwards the fy14 production estimate to 2.7% lower y-o-y from 3% growth previously. mature acreage is only projected to increase by 400ha in fy14. in fy15, however, management estimates 1,000ha will reach maturity, coinciding with the rally in the cpo price. we estimate the total planted area will increase by 3% to 22,300ha. key risk factors to our earnings

shareholder. we note, however, that liew exercised the third and final tranche of his put option on march 21 and is no longer a shareholder of s p setia. in our view, it may not be easy for syed

vessels delivered do not commence work immediately. sarawak oil palms bhdtarget price: rm6.90 buy maybank ib research (march 24): investors were pleasantly surprised to learn that sarawak oil palms

(crude palm oil) price, lower ffb output and lower cpo sales volume which resulted in lower operating profit from the division. meanwhile, the motor division was affected by weak demand in singapore and the economic slowdown in thailand. despite sime darby's lower core net profit, hlib said the results were in line with its expectations. we consider the results largely in line with our
