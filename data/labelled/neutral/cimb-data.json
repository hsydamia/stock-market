future earnings  analysts", "article": " kuala lumpur (sept 7): 7-eleven malaysia holdings bhd has lowered this years target to open its convenience stores to 100, from a previous forecast of 200, and its earnings are likely to be impacted as a result of the government introducing a new minimum wage scheme, according to an analyst with maybank investment bank bhd. on store openings however, we believe 7-eleven has turned more cautious, maybanks analyst liew wei han said in a note to clients today. having only opened 16 (net) stores in the first half of 2018 (1h18), it has since revised its targeted store openings to 100, from 200 in financial year ended dec 31, 2018 (fy18), liew added. according to cimb investment bank bhd, 7-elevens slower store expansion was on the back of its current emphasis on improving existing stores, in which it had managed to refurbish 99 stores in 1h18. 7-eleven also shared that it will now focus on refurbishing its stores for a more refreshed store front outlook and is on track to meet its goal of 150 refurbished stores a year, cimb analyst kristine wong and walter aw said in a note to clients today. at the same time, both maybank and cimb expressed their concern on 7-elevens earnings in fy19, which will see the bottomline by between 8.5% to 9.5% over the next two financial years. minimum wage will raise overheads, while the decision to maintain prices post sales tax implementation may dampen margins, maybank added. currently, maybank said between 80% to 90% of 7-elevens employees, which is equivalent to a staff force of between 13,000 and 14,000, are on the minimum wage scheme. meanwhile, cimb said the governments plan to roll-out a new minimum wage scheme of rm1,050 per month starting from jan 1, 2019, could potentially increase 7-elevens staff cost by between rm600,000 per month to rm700,000 per month, equivalent to an annual personnel cost of between rm7.2 million and rm8.4 million. assuming an average rm50 per month increase in minimum wage, personnel expenses could rise by about rm7 million per annum, maybank added, noting this is equivalent to 5% of 7-elevens earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in fy18. on wednesday (sept 5), the prime ministers office announced that the government had decided to raise the national monthly minimum wage rate to rm1,050 beginning next year, which is a rm50 more from the current rm1,000 in peninsular malaysia; and rm920 in sabah, sarawak and labuan. despite the government rolling-out the sales and services tax (sst) early this month, maybank said 7-eleven will leverage on its buyer power and intends to maintain prices at its convenience stores in the near term. with the implementation of the sst from sept 1, 2019, we understand that some suppliers have proposed to increase prices by an average of 5% to 6%, maybank said. however, 7-eleven has made an exception to the price of the cigarettes, which currently contributes 36% of sales in 1h18, maybank said, adding any cost increase will be passed on to consumers. going forward, cimb said 7-eleven will focus on increasing its product offerings, particularly in the ready-to-eat segment, which generates around 10% of its total annual revenue. moving forward, it intends to introduce rte [ready-to-eat] products in limited stores (5-10 outlets) by end-2018, to gauge consumer response, cimb added. given its large network of stores across the country, cimb said 7-eleven did not discount the possibility of setting up its own centralised kitchen, or working with a partner having existing facilities. as for the stock recommendation, maybank is retaining its sell call, while cimb is keeping to its reduce call on cautious earnings outlook. citing headwinds ahead, maybank said it has lowered 7-elevens fair value, with the 12-month target price reduced by 12 sen to rm1.12, from a previous forecast of rm1.24. at current price tag that is costing an arm and a leg, cimb said it is keeping 7-elevens fair value at rm1.05, a 25.2% downside to yesterdays closing price of rm1.40. we advise investors to stay away from the stock, pending effective execution of its long-term cost-saving initiatives, cimb added. at noon-break, 7-eleven shares paused at rm1.29, valuing the convenience store at a market capitalisation of rm1.59 billion."}, "2": {"date_posted": "7/9/2018",

\"it is not cheap enough for me to be excited.\" he noted that although some foreign stock markets have climbed, singapore and china stocks are still slightly cheaper than malaysian stocks in terms of

issued?", "article": " the government is understood to have issued refined sugar import licences to a handful of individuals, which could impact the duopoly of msm malaysia holdings bhd and tradewinds corp bhd, sources familiar with the matter tell the edge. msm is a 51% unit of publicly traded felda global ventures holdings bhd (fgv), which, in turn, is a third controlled by the federal land development authority (felda). tradewinds is a wholly-owned unit of businessman tan sri syed mokhtar albukhary. msm controls msm prai bhd  which operates a sugar refinery in prai, penang  msm perlis sdn bhd and msm sugar refinery (johor) sdn bhd, whose new plant in tanjung langsat, johor, is scheduled for completion next year. tradewinds sugar business is held under central sugars refinery sdn bhd and gula padang terap sdn bhd. as far as i know, at least three licences have been issued. however, some say there are three new licences for peninsular malaysia and two for sabah and sarawak, a source says. however, some high-ranking executives of fgv and msm were surprised by the news. another source close to msm says the new licences were awarded by the ministry of domestic trade, co-operatives and consumerism. we (msm) cant stop it, but we can protest. i heard they (the new importers) are not allowed (to import in) big quantities, he says. some officials were surprised as msm has just spent some rm1.1 billion on the tanjung langsat refinery and is acquiring plantations and mills in indonesia. the new refinery is expected to increase msms total refining capacity from 1.25 million tonnes per annum to 2.25 million tonnes. considering the 14th general election, which must be held next year, it seems unlikely for any issuing of licences or approvals that may adversely impact msm and fgv. felda has 33.67% equity interest in plantation giant fgv, and felda settlers make up the bulk of voters of as many as 54 constituencies. as it is, there has been much volatility in the sugar refining business locally, and margins have come under pressure as a result of several changes in the operating landscape, which include the scrapping of approved permits to import sugar, the implementation of special price quotas and the withdrawal of sugar subsidies. malaysias refined sugar is the second cheapest in asean, only more expensive than thailand, which has resulted in smuggling activities. in-flight caterer brahims holdings bhds 60%-owned subsidiary admuda sdn bhd was given the green light in 2013 to build a rm150 million sugar refinery in demak laut industrial park, kuching, sarawak, but opted out of it. brahims is now in court over the non-payment of progress claims and in talks to exit the venture. despite having a 60% share of the sugar market, msm has definitely seen better days. in its nine months ended sept 30, the company suffered a net loss of rm45.66 million on revenue of rm2.01 billion. as at end-september, it had cash and cash equivalents of rm134.01 million and short-term debt commitments of rm1.02 billion. according to the notes accompanying its financials, msms losses were due to higher production costs, increased raw material cost and a weaker ringgit. msm says its performance is expected to improve in the near to medium term as a direct result of lower raw sugar prices and an improvement in operation costs. cimb research, in a note last month, has forecast msm raking in a net profit of rm15.9 million on revenue of rm2.77 billion for the year ending december 2017. however, the research house has a reduce call on msms stock due to poor earnings and potential losses from its new sugar refinery due to weak domestic demand for sugar. tradewinds suffered an after-tax loss of rm112.31 million from rm505.53 million in revenue in its financial year ended december 2015. however, the company has several other businesses under its belt, such as plantations, property and hotels.

forecasts of lower prices in the coming months. leading industry analyst dr james fry said on sept 13 that the price of the edible oil is expected to decline 17% by november to december. another palm oil price forecaster, thomas mielke, while not as bearish, sees cpo trading at around rm2,600 per tonne or below in the final quarter of the year due to improved palm oil production, which will raise the inventory level. analysts are recommending that investors be selective about the plantation stocks they want to buy amid weakening cpo prices. cimb investment bank regional head of plantations ivy ng expects palm oil production to increase in the remaining months of the year, pushing up the stockpile and putting downward pressure on prices amid rising soybean oil inventory level. if production continues to increase, cpo prices may taper off. our message to investors is that we dont think the stock level of palm oil has peaked, she tells the edge over the telephone. malaysian palm oil board (mpob) data shows that the palm oil stockpile reached 1.94 million tonnes in august  the highest since february last year when the inventory level stood at 2.17 million tonnes. ng, who has assigned an add rating and a target price of rm10 to sime darby bhd, says cpo will be trading between rm2,500 and rm2,800 per tonne by end-september. in a sept 12 note to clients, she says she likes sime darby because she expects its share price to be re-rated on the back of higher commodity prices and on its plan to demerge its plantation and property divisions and list them separately. rhb research regional head of plantations hoe lee leng expects cpo prices to drop to a low of rm2,500 per tonne over the rest of the year. maybe cpo will hit rm2,500 per tonne in the fourth quarter because of the growing production and stock levels. i expect 2017 to be a bumper year as planters ramped up production after the el niu00f1o drought last year, she says. of the 11 plantation counters she covers, hoe has a buy rating on sarawak oil palms bhd (sop) and cb industrial product holding bhd (cbip) with a target price of rm4.20 and rm2.40 respectively. areca capital sdn bhd ceo danny wong also likes sop and cbip as their earnings visibility is higher than that of their peers. we prefer to look at companies whose business is simpler than that of bigger (plantation) groups as their earnings are easier to predict. it is not simple to analyse plantation counters as there are many factors to consider. cpo price is one of the important factors but this does not necessarily mean that it correlates with the earnings of palm oil producers. it depends on the timing of their acquisition of inventory as well, he says. wong also doubts that the current strength of cpo prices is sustainable in the long term as demand is weakening. according to mpob data, palm oil exports in august declined 18.5% year on year to 1.49 million tonnes but climbed 6.43% from 1.4 million tonnes in july. midf research plantation analyst alan lim, meanwhile, is relatively positive about near-term cpo prices. we note that september inventory in malaysia will rise 7% to 2.08 million tonnes. however, the price of cpo should be supported at above rm2,700 per tonne throughout the fourth quarter of this year as long as the soybean oil price remains above us$725 per tonne or about us$0.33 per pound on the chicago board of trade, he says. we think the soybean oil price should remain high due to low production in the us and south america. the ceiling for cpo is rm2,950 per tonne as we think that most producers will sell forward significantly once the price climbs towards rm3,000 per tonne. apart from lim, leading edible oils industry analyst, dorab mistry, is also bullish about cpo prices, predicting that the commodity will trade between rm2,600 and rm3,000 per tonne by january next year as long as the malaysian stockpile remains below 2.6 million tonnes. cimbs ng believes that the stockpile of soybean oil, the main substitute for palm oil, is also high. the stock level of soybean oil, as it currently stands, is quite high and the new crop in the us is also doing okay, she says. rhbs hoe concurs,

is this momentum sustainable? a ceo of a banking group says it is still too early to make a definite assessment. of course, we are all hoping that things will turn for the better, but i think it is still early [days] to conclude that this is a strong movement, he tells the edge. he points out that at the macro level, a couple of things are turning positive. the stock market is [performing] better ... people may feel they have a bit more means. the overall [economic] growth rate has improved a bit. so, lets hope we are turning the corner, but it is still early [days]. it is not a full-fledged recovery yet, i would say u2026 but we hope this could be the turning point, the ceo says. things are clearly looking up following the cautious approach adopted due to uncertainties in the past two years, says thoo mee ling, head of secured lending at ocbc bank (malaysia) bhd. yes, we can certainly expect better times ahead from the already improving scenario. the uptick in loan applications and approvals can be attributed to several factors such as developers launching more mid-range and affordable properties, and in the secondary market, sellers becoming more realistic in their asking prices. perhaps most importantly, there is now a constant flow of buyers who are purchasing properties to stay, rather than as investment, she says. nazri othman, acting head of group retail banking at rhb banking group, is optimistic about the performance of the property market, especially in the groups targeted areas, that is, the urban or market centres such as the klang valley, penang and johor baru. we are confident that demand will remain sustainable as malaysia progresses to become a developed nation with an increased rate of migration to urban centres, which provide higher earning power. the majority of developers are launching more affordable properties priced at rm400,000 to rm600,000. therefore, applications for loans ranging from rm360,000 to rm540,000 are increasing, he says. defaults in monthly repayments are not significant. hence, banks have more room for better debt servicing ratio for more individuals. the lacklustre property market and low rental yield, coupled with cooling measures introduced earlier, have led to reduced speculative activity, and more genuine homebuyers are entering the market, nazri says. currently, we are seeing more individuals buying properties for their own use rather than for speculation. genuine property buyers basically have stronger credit ratings than speculators who buy for the purpose of reselling them later for a profit, he says. we have observed that some speculators are willing to dispose of their properties for lower gains. some even sold them off at their purchase price. this segment is giving the secondary market a slight lift. vipin agrawal, head of cards, retail assets and deposits at cimb group holdings bhds consumer banking business, says there was an increase in property launches, which include affordable homes under the pr1ma housing programme, in last six months. property fairs were held relatively more frequent. as a result, the demand for loans increased and is expected to remain so for the rest of the year, he says. loan approval rates had dropped after bank negara introduced stricter lending rules a few years ago. the rules include imposing a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 70% on borrowers with three or more outstanding housing loans while property buyers no longer have the option of taking loans for longer than 35 years. bank negara, in its 1q2017 quarterly bulletin, notes that the measures, introduced in 2010, were aimed at curbing excessive speculative activity in the property market and deterring over-borrowing. the maximum loan-to-value ratio of 70% is imposed only on applicants with three or more outstanding housing loans. therefore, this measure does not affect eligible first-time house buyers, who typically qualify for an loan-to-value ratio of up to 95% (including mortgage reducing/decreasing term assurance), the central bank says. in fact, this improves the chances of first-time homebuyers getting a loan as it shifts financial institutions focus away from speculators. last year, 72% of housing loan borrowers were first-time buyers of homes priced below rm500,000. according to national property information centre data, the value of residential properties transacted rose to rm16.39 billion y-o-y in 1q2017 from rm16.25 billion. the number of residential property transactions dropped to 46,934 from 49,608. this implies that the transactions in the first half of the year were from the segment with a higher value. it is worth noting that the stamp duty for real estate valued at more than rm1 million will be increased to 4% from 3% effective jan 1 next year, as announced under budget 2017. industry players believe that although this may further dampen the high-end property market, it could boost the sales of million-ringgit homes until the end of the year.

long-term investor of the company would have seen an annual return of about 38.34% in the last 10 years. another fund manager said that it is a tall order to maintain its earnings growth but the

continues to remain positive about the stock for the next six months in light of the establishment of a new fpso in ghana. our hope is that all the bad news is out and moving forward earnings could start to pick up, he told the edge financial daily. net profit for the first financial quarter of fy17 (1qfy17) doubled to rm48.11 million on higher fpso contribution although revenue slipped 6.17% to rm404.17 million due to lower utilisation of its offshore support vessel (osv). however, the results marked a turnaround from a poor 4qfy16, with a net loss of rm1.29 billion due to impairment charges. according to bloomberg data, 10 analysts have a buy recommendation on the stock while eight recommend holding it. cimb research resumed coverage on the company, asias largest fpso and osv operator, in early june with an add call, saying that with two terrible years now behind it, the group can look forward to improved earnings and cash flow. however, aminvest research, which has a hold call on the stock, said that the cessation of fpso operations in nigeria warranted a cautious outlook for its near-term earnings trajectory.  by samantha ho   inari amertron bhd\none main catalyst for inari amertron bhd being chosen as one of the top picks for the year was the anticipated positive impact from iphones 10th anniversary this year especially with the company having a solid relationship with broadcom, which has a three-year supply agreement with apple until 2018. the initial fear of how trumps protectionism policy would affect inari has also subsided, which is positive for the group as well. affin hwang investment bank bhds analyst, kevin low, said in his report dated june 29, that inari should see a seasonal pickup in the radio frequency division to facilitate new builds for its us customer in 2h17. he said that inari is upgrading tester capacity by 10% to 770 units. according to low, production of the iris chips has gradually ramped up to its installed capacity of five million units per month after being fully qualified in february this year and he expected the capacity to double in july with further plans of capacity expansion by the third quarter of this year, bringing installed capacity closer to the 16 million units per month level. the iris chips are expected to contribute up to 14% of inaris earnings by fy18. besides near-term growth being fuelled by rising mobile device complexity, wider global lte coverage and broader adoption of the iris biometric scanning function, inari also has a foot in the data server business and vertical cavity surface emitting laser packaging should also allow inari to ride on the next wave of laser growth. in 1h17, the groups share price gained 29.63%. affin hwang maintains its buy call for the company with a tp of rm2.60, which indicates an upside of 18.2% as of its closing price of rm2.20 last friday.  by billy toh   sime darby bhd\nsime darby bhds share price had been expected to climb on proposed corporate restructuring following the appointment of tan sri abdul wahid omar as the chairman of sime darbys controlling shareholder, permodalan nasional bhd. half a year down the road, the conglomerate has offered more clarity on the restructuring plan, announcing an in specie dividend to existing shareholders for both its property and plantation units sometime in 4q17. its share price had gained 16% as at june 30. according to bloomberg data, buy calls on the stock continue to outweigh hold calls by 11 to nine. out of 23 analysts who cover the stock, the consensus tp of 19 of them is rm9.81 per share in sime darby. however, moodys investors service has cautioned that it may downgrade the groups baa1 rating on uncertainties from the spin-offs as this would reduce diversification, scale and cash flow, thereby raising the groups business risks.  by samantha ho   genting malaysia bhd\nalthough genting malaysia bhd ended 1h17 as the second-best performer on the fbm klci with a 20.09% increase in share price, the party may not be over for the gaming counter just yet as more gaming and non-gaming revenue is expected to roll in throughout its upcoming quarters on full operations at its sky plaza. maybank ib researchs samuel yin shao yang lifted earnings estimates by 3% to 6% for the next three years on higher priced meals at sky avenue, a higher average price per ticket at 20th century fox world and a maiden 20th century fox world sponsorship income of some rm50 million effective mid-2017. the research house upgraded its call from hold to buy and the counters tp by 14% to rm6.15 from rm5.40, with earnings expected to grow in 3qfy17 supported by the opening of vip rooms and 250 suites at the sky plaza, genting highlands premium outlet and the theme park hotel. we also understand that most sky avenue tenants will begin paying rent in 3qfy17 after their rent-free period expires, yin noted. the 12-month consensus tp from 20 analysts is rm6.15, with seven having a buy call and 11 analysts having a hold call, while two are telling clients to sell the stock.  by samantha ho   ta ann holdings bhd\nexpected to see a turnaround in 2017, ta ann holdings bhd was the worst performer in 1h17 among the 10 stock picks as its share price fell by 10.4%. instead of bottom fishing, the experience of holding ta ann shares for investors would probably feel more like catching a falling knife instead. nonetheless, analysts remain positive about the company, with bloomberg compilation showing a 12-month tp of rm3.93, indicating an upside of 11.3%. however, of nine analysts, only two of them have a buy call with the rest recommending to hold. midf research recommended a buy call with a tp of rm4.30, which represents 21.8% upside to ta anns 1qfy17 core net income of rm42.2 million, which was above expectations. alan lim, the analyst from midf research, said that the strong result was caused by stellar performance of the plantation division as 1qfy17 fresh fruit bunch (ffb) production growth came in stronger than expected at 20% year-on-year to 148,715 tonnes. while the kl plantation index gained 3.9%, ta ann saw its share price fall by 10.4%. recall that the group also saw a lacklustre year in 2016 when its share price fell by 5.58%. lim said the recommendation being upgraded to buy was due to an expectation of plantation divisions earnings growth to remain strong on high ffb volume seen at 10%, the timber division to remain profitable due to support from high export log prices and it is a key laggard among plantation stocks.  by billy toh   protasco bhd\npicked as one of the construction players that were expected to benefit from the governments spending on infrastructure building, protasco bhd had not been up to the expectations, at least in terms of share price. the stock dropped nearly 8% in 1h17. nonetheless, the company saw its joint venture with kumpulan perangsang selangor bhd awarded a rm174.4 million contract for the proposed infrastructure works at pulau indah industrial park, which are for 18 months and scheduled for completion in january 2019. jeremy goh, an analyst with hong leong investment bank (ib), shared that protasco has a letter of intent for phase three of the 1malaysia housing project for civil servants in putrajaya. other than a potential election play, protasco also has a strong defensive nature for a construction player with its dividend yield of about 5.7%. hong leong ib has a tp of rm1.20 for protasco, indicating an upside of 14.3% based on its close last thursday.  by billy toh   sapura energy bhd\no&g services provider sapura energy bhd, previously sapurakencana petroleum bhd, saw its share price take a beating after reporting a 75% slump in its net profit for 1qfy18. a low oil price environment and worsening rig utilisation also did not help. its share price had seen a drop in profitability amid higher taxation. its revenue took a hit in 1qfy18, falling 9% on lower contributions from the drilling and exploration segment and the production segment. the results sent its share price down to rm1.57  the lowest level since early december last year. it closed at rm1.65 last friday, trading at a forward per of slightly more than 40%, according to bloomberg. bloomberg data indicates that a higher number of analysts  now seven  has a buy call on the stock compared with the five that recommended adding it at the beginning of the year. however, six analysts downgraded the stock within the past two months, lowering the consensus tp to rm3.19.  by samantha ho   classic scenic bhd\nwhile classic scenic bhd underperformed against the fbm klci, the company has proven to be a resilient counter that is suitable for a defensive strategy with a high dividend yield of about 6.04%. the wooden picture frame makers share price increased by 1.68% in 1h17. its latest quarterly financial results showed a 12.2% decline in net profit to rm3.7 million for 1qfy17 from rm4.2 million in the corresponding quarter a year ago, mainly attributed to a varying product mix and higher cost of labour and operating expenses as a result of lower fair value gain from foreign currency forward contracts. the company is primarily involved in the manufacturing and export of high-end wooden picture framework mouldings and about 90% of its sales come from the export market, mainly to the us and are denominated in us dollars. classic scenic continues to remain one of the best defensive counters given the strong balance sheet, with its net cash standing at rm26.4 million or 21.9 sen per share at end-march, an increase from rm23.9 million in 2016. the group also has a good track record of generous dividend payout. in 2016, classic scenic paid a total of 11 sen per share for dividends, up from 10 sen per share a year ago. insiderasia, which remains positive about the company, estimated a total dividend of 13 sen to 14 sen per share for 2017, giving an above-market average yield of above 7%. by billy toh   gamuda bhd\ngamuda bhd, whose shares soared 14.29% year-to-date to close at an eight-year high of rm5.50 per share, still appears to be riding on a wave of optimism towards the construction sector ahead of the upcoming elections. widely held as a proxy for the sector and beneficiary of expected infrastructure jobs to be awarded, the counter still commands a buy call by 18 out of 23 analysts covered by bloomberg data. the consensus tp is rm5.93 per share by 20 out of 23 analysts. cimb research kept the counter as its top pick as a beneficiary of the rail theme, with hong leong investment bank agreeing that gamuda would ride on upcoming mega rail projects such as the kuala lumpur-singapore high-speed rail, light rail transit line 3 and east coast rail link. meanwhile, affinhwang capital research had cut its earnings forecast by 5% to 6% to reflect lower property earnings and higher tax rates. however, it raised its tp for the stock to rm5.94 per share and highlighted that the group targeted a higher new contract target of rm10 billion from rm3 billion to rm4 billion this year. property sales recovered for gamuda in 3qfy17 at rm620 million compared with rm575 million in the year before. net profit had been on a climb over the past three quarters to rm170.93 million in 3qfy17. the group also announced that it would be paying a second interim dividend of six sen per share on july 28. by samantha ho\n"}, "25": {"date_posted": "24/4/2017", "title": "lead story: adopt a defensive and prudent strategy, experts tell retail investors", "article": " despite unfavourable economic prospects, and fears about the trump presidency and brexit vote last year, global stock markets seem to be flourishing, especially wall street, which is hitting record highs. based on the s&p 500 indexs closing of 2,328.95 points last thursday, the benchmark has gained 4.03% year to date. local bellwether the fbm klci did even better, rising 5.8% ytd. it ended at 1,738.18 points last thursday. interestingly, small caps are outperforming the rest of the market with the fbm small cap index having gained 19% ytd at its closing of 17,316.2 points last thursday. on the trading screens at least, there has been a surge in optimism. equity investors the world over may disagree with us president donald trumps policies but they certainly cannot complain about the short-term effects on their portfolios. but can the bullishness be sustained or will the bears be proved right at a later date? opinions are divided. veteran fund manager and investment guru dr tan chong koay believes that the rally in us equities after the american presidential election was due to positive sentiment on trumps pro-economic growth agenda. this includes promises of higher public spending on infrastructure and massive tax cuts for businesses. improved us economic data, for example, the march unemployment rate of 4.5%, a new post-crisis low, has only added to the buoyancy. as the dow jones industrial average is now at a historical high, the market will now focus on the delivery of trumps promises. a shortfall may lead to a market correction, he tells the edge. tan opines that the main risks to global and local equities, which investors should monitor closely, are the geopolitical developments in syria and north korea, the french presidential election on april 23, malaysias impending 14th general election as well as the ringgits volatility. we maintain our cautiously optimistic view and selectiveness in stock pricing. the corporate quarterly results reporting season in may will be the key driver of share prices. in general, investors should sell their shares if they feel they are overvalued, he advises. the founder, executive chairman and chief strategist of pheim asset management sdn bhd also reminds investors to not be fully invested at all times. we believe investors should trim their portfolios when the market is near the peak and increase equity exposure to nearly fully invested when there is a strong correction and the market is approaching its trough, he explains. he says retail investors who lack the capability or the time to analyse fundamental and technical factors should find fund managers with a positive long-term track record to manage their funds. midf research deputy head of research mohd redza abdul rahman concurs. investors shall always look at a companys fundamentals and compare them with those of its peers in the same industry. and if this information is too complicated for them, they should approach licensed investment advisers for guidance, he says. he adds that if managing a number of stocks is difficult for some, they should invest in unit trust funds where the investment decisions are made by professionals. there are gems among the mid caps and small caps but one has to also understand the companys prospects and how it has been performing. if the news is too good to be true, then probably it is. investors should make an informed decision based on data and facts, leaving emotions aside. redza points out that when the market is hot, investors tend to follow the herd and make uninformed investment decision, resulting in irrational exuberance in the market  when share prices are driven beyond their fundamentals despite the absence of positive corporate developments that warrant a drastic price rise. the growing confidence in the capital market will also coincide with the rise in unlicensed investment advisers offering tips to entice investors into flocking to certain counters and buying them at high prices. such action pushes the prices even higher, although there is no positive newsflow and catalysts to support the companies fundamentals. and when the prices fall, it is the layman who gets caught with significant paper losses, he warns. according to malaysia investors association president datin ho choy meng, a booming market provides institutional investors with a good opportunity to unload massive blocks of shares to realise the cash needed to pay their unitholders dividends. therefore, she says, retail investors should adopt a defensive and prudent strategy that emphasises capital protection, reasonable returns and asset growth. individual investors must be mindful of the volatility of global stock markets that is caused by fund managers constant moves to reap the most gains from the most promising bourses. hot money comes and goes as foreign fund managers make very fluid investment decisions; they do not show mercy, she cautions. ho also advises retail investors to know their limit and not commit more than what they can afford to lose. margin trading seems to give them multifold profits but once the market trends go into reverse, they will see all their hard-earned money wiped out. there will be blood on the trading floors, belonging to the many herd-instinct players who are vulnerable to adverse market forces. nevertheless, not everyone is sceptical about the recent bull run. etiqa insurance & takaful head of research chris eng poh yoon, who has been telling people to invest in stocks since august last year, is not surprised by the stock market rally as he had predicted that the economies of the us, europe and china would strengthen. the local market can still run if the us market moves higher. malaysia should outperform its regional peers if that happens. [now], selling by local funds has capped our rally, although the foreigners have returned to our market. so, there can be one more leg-up if the locals stop selling, he says. investors, however, should be wary of a may/june selldown due to global profit-taking, eng warns. hong leong investment bank bhd dealer representative frank lin is also of the view that the stock market rally is not overdone, considering that stocks such as genting bhd, malayan banking bhd and cimb group holdings bhd are not trading at all-time highs.

with, and the investment in eagle high is expected to be concluded by end of february or at the latest early march, it added. prior to this, a felda subsidiary, fic properties had signed a sale and purchase agreement with rajawali group on dec 23, 2016. felda said then the proposed acquisition was in line with its aim to become one of the worlds largest oil palm plantation groups. on the same

portfolios; [it is] not limited to fgv but to any other portfolio as well. nevertheless, [the] recent fgv sale transaction by kpf has sparked a negative view by [the] media on fgv. the said transaction was a mere trading activity, it said, adding the disposal was undertaken as the cooperative felt it was timely to realise some profits from fgv shares when the price moved above its holding costs. it said it currently owns about 5.8% of fgvs equity interest, and that these shares are managed under two funds, namely held for trading and available for sale. being part of the felda group, kpf believes fgv is in good hands under the helm of datuk zakaria arshad, the chief executive officer/group president, and the management, it said. kpf also expressed confidence that there will be a more positive impact on fgvs performance in the near future, given that crude palm oil prices have increased to over rm3,000 per tonne now. kpf's statement came after fgv announced via bursa

slightly over a week after its listing. the counter has since declined by about 60%, which lost it some rm10 billion in market capitalisation. last december, the employees provident fund (epf)

as it auctioned off its rapeseed oil from last year, it could push our exports up between 5% and 10% this year, she said. kenanga investment bank bhd analyst voon yee ping said chinese demand came off last year because of high stock levels in 1h16. she said demand for palm oil would sustain throughout 2017 with 10% expected growth in demand from china in 1h17. meanwhile, in a sector note yesterday, ng opined that crude palm oil (cpo) prices have been holding firm above rm3,000 per tonne since the start of 2017 due to the weak ringgit and tight stockpile. she said in january 2017, cpo prices averaged rm3,268 per tonne while palm kernel prices surged to another monthly record high of rm3,659 per tonne. we project cpo prices will trade in the rm3,000 to rm3,300 per tonne range in february

ever sukuk in the world to offer exposure to the growing water utility sector in china. in addition, it is the only equity-linked transaction to achieve more than 40% exchange premium in asia-pacific ex-japan this year. the sukuk is exchangeable into shares in beijing enterprises water group ltd (bewg), one of the leading integrated water and sewerage treatment solutions service providers in

achieved by an exchangeable bond/sukuk in the utility and energy sector in asia-pacific ex-japan since 2003. overall, the books were strongly covered with over 50 accounts participating. the allocation achieved a well-diversified investor base with asian investors accounting for 60% of the deal with the balance allocated to european investors. the demand was equally spread between convertible bond outright investors and hedge funds. furthermore, the sukuk also traded above par in the secondary market post-issuance. overall, the sukuk achieved several objectives. it allowed khazanah to forward-monetise its investment at a substantial premium to the prevailing market price. the zero periodic distribution rate and zero yield structure also made the exercise cost-efficient from a funding perspective, reducing khazanahs funding costs. lastly, the innovative structure of the sukuk allowed khazanah to undertake the transaction in a shariah-compliant manner, which is one of its funding objectives, despite the fact that the underlying company, bewg, is not shariah-compliant.

37% stake in indonesias pt eagle high plantations tbk for us$505.4 million (rm2.26 billion) amid concerns that it is overpaying for a non-controlling stake. in a statement on sunday, felda addressed the issue relating to the eagle high share purchase transaction in the form of answers to frequently asked questions. stating that they are only basic information, it added that detailed information on the transaction will be announced after approvals from relevant authorities have been obtained. last friday, feldas subsidiary fic properties sdn bhd (ficp) inked a sale and purchase agreement with rajawali group to acquire the significant stake in jakarta-listed eagle high, which is also one of indonesias largest palm oil companies. on the same day, datuk seri nazir razak, chairman of cimb group holdings bhd and younger brother of prime minister datuk seri najib razak, had taken to the social media platform to question the deal. nazir posted a black-and-white photograph on his instagram of his father  the late prime minister tun abdul razak hussein  addressing a group of people, presumably early felda settlers. the photograph was uploaded on instagram together with the message: felda announced buying 37% of eagle high for us$505m or 580 rupiah per share. eagle highs average price in november was 212 rupiah per share, so a 173% premium for a non-control[ling] stake. i hope the board will fully justify the acquisition & valuation even though the deal is no longer made by listed fgv (felda global ventures holdings bhd). wan saiful wan jan, who heads the institute for democracy and economic affairs, has also reportedly questioned the high price, adding that the main focus was the risks the deal may pose to taxpayers. to recap, feldas 20%-owned unit fgv in june last year announced plans to purchase a 30% interest in eagle high for us$632 million in cash and a further 7% stake via an issue of 95 million new fgv shares worth us$48 million, which gave the deal a total valuation of us$680 million or rm2.89 billion then. however, fgv had reportedly been advised by its bankers, jpmorgan and bank of america, to opt out of the deal as the us$680 million price tag was seen as too high for the 37% eagle high stake. below are feldas answers to seven frequently asked questions on the eagle high share purchase transaction:  1. does the deal affect the settlers well-being? the deal is a stand-alone investment with its own financing and will not impact feldas existing commitments and programmes to improve the well-being of the settlers.  2. is felda paying too high of a premium over the market price of eagle high shares which some quarters claimed it is as high as 173%? share price is not the accepted valuation method when it comes to plantation companies. the share price may not reflect the true value of eagle high. the accepted valuation is enterprise value per hectare which is us$16,000 enterprise value per hectare (ev/ha)  that is what felda paid for the 37% stake. this value compares favourably with recent transactions involving indonesian palm oil companies.  3. what are the recent comparative transactions involving indonesian plantation companies? for comparison, kuala lumpur kepong bhds recent final offer of us$15,500 ev/ha was rejected by mp evans group plcs board of directors. mp evans independent valuation put the value at us$17,300 ev/ha. mp evans board had asked for valuation of us$24,000 ev/ha for the company. at us$505.4 million, felda is purchasing the eagle high stake at us$16,000 ev/ha. mp evans planted land is 31,400ha; eagle highs planted area is 125,000ha. felda is purchasing access to land four times the size of mp evans at a lower ev/ha than mp evans independent valuation. also, the concluded purchase by sime darby bhd of new britain palm oil ltd was at an ev/ha of us$27,000.  4. any other reasons why share price is not an accurate valuation? share price also does not reflect the true value because eagle high shares are mainly controlled by rajawali group (70%+). plus, it is listed on the jakarta stock exchange where it is not as liquid as bursa malaysia or the singapore exchange.  5. what other items were factored into the purchase price? the purchase price took into account scarcity value of eagle high. no other plantation of this large size is available for sale especially at this valuation. this is the last opportunity for felda/malaysia or any other foreign parties to acquire an indonesian company with a massive land bank. the indonesian government agrees to a one-time exception for this deal.  6. how does the deal benefit felda? the deal will improve feldas crop profile as the average age of eagle highs trees is seven years versus feldas 15 years. there would be a lot of collaborations and cross-selling between felda and eagle high. there are potential new businesses and synergies for felda group in seedling, fertilisers, crude palm oil trading, downstream/oleochemical, and potential entry to the vast indonesian market of 260 million people for felda groups finished and consumer products.  7. how does the deal benefit the country? investment in a major palm oil player in indonesia is in line with the malaysian governments effort to ensure the country continues to be a major player in the global palm oil industry. it will act as an impetus to move forward the agenda of the recently established council of palm oil producing countries to stabilise global palm oil prices."}, "43": {"date_posted": "15/12/2016", "title": "crude palm oil

extension in the second half of 2017. meanwhile, rmgs joint-venture shanghai hospital is expected to be completed by late 2018. raffles medical had also recently-acquired international sos (isos), a healthcare provider with 10 clinics across china, vietnam and cambodia. with two new medical centres ramping up and two new hospitals coming on-stream over the next two years, we believe raffles medicals growth potential is becoming exciting once again, says rhb analyst juliana cai in a tuesday report. rhb is keeping its buy recommendation on raffles medical with a higher target price of s$1.76, from s$1.70 previously. however, the expansion comes at a cost. dbs group research warns that raffles medical might see slower growth ahead, because of the expansions. we project growth over the next few years to be a tad slower than its historical average, following gestation period from its expansion plans, says dbs lead analyst rachel tan, adding that the counter has reflected its growth potential. dbs is maintaining its hold recommendation on raffles medical with an unchanged target price of s$1.43. while rmgs revenue for the quarter was up 17.5% at s$199.3 million, compared with s$101.5 million the year before, the groups rise in revenue growth was offset by a 23% increase in staff cost. staff cost continues to be under pressure, due to recruitment for holland v, made worse by the higher cost structure at isos, says cimb analyst jonathan seow. taking a 3-year view, we think the staff/cost revenue ratio should remain at an elevated level, as the larger magnitude of the hospital extension further adds to cost pressure. cimb is keeping its reduce rating on raffles medical, but increases its target price to s$1.46, from s$1.41 previously. taking into account the expanding business operations, as well as the new medical centre in raffles holland v, uob kay hian lead analyst andrew chow says it is unsurprising that rmgs costs outpaced its revenue. staff costs as a percentage of turnover rose to 51.5% in 9m16, compared with 49.8% in 9m15, owing to step up in recruitment to support expanding business operations, chow says. in addition, rmgs staff costs were burdened by higher cost structure at isos, with an estimated staff cost/turnover of 60%, compared with 50% in singapore operations. chow says that excluding isos, raffles medical's operating profit in 3q16 would have grown by 4.5%, instead of 0.3%. maybank kim eng analyst john cheong, however, believes that rmgs 3q performance, is in line with expectations and that recent expansions are stacking up well. local operations continued to grow steadily from various expansions, says cheong. management remains positive on its china expansion, due to the countrys underserved population and its

their cost of capital and raising the need to increase its gearing level. one way to raise gearing is to retain less of its earnings. its current dividend payout ratio is only effectively 25%. we believe it could pay at least 70% of its profit as dividend, which translates into an up to 6.5% yield in financial year 2017. however, a bigger challenge to lowering the t&d assets wacc lies in estimating the cost of equity. the current wacc of 7.5% is anchored on tnbs stock beta from 2004 to 2012. in theory, tnb has a below-average systematic risk because of its stable earnings. in practice, however, its beta is 1.1 (since the ibr started in 2014) as it is a market proxy for foreign investors. it is also a heavyweight in the fbm klci and has high liquidity. on top of that, tnb has other businesses that range from power generation to port operation, which have different business risk profiles compared to t&d. as such, tnbs beta may not reflect the systematic risk of its t&d assets. a separate listing of the t&d divisions will allow the beta of the t&d assets to be accurately measured and ensure that the t&d assets earn a fair rate of return from consumers, in our view. if the spin-off happens, the t&d divisions could be worth rm68 billion to rm87 billion, whereas the remaining net assets could be worth rm27 billion to rm55 billion. the combined market capitalisation could be rm95 billion to rm142 billion or 17% to 75% higher than its current market capitalisation.  cimb research, oct 13"}, "51": {"date_posted": "4/10/2016", "title": "khazanah's delicate balancing act ", "article": "  over the past decade, khazanah nasional bhds portfolio has performed quite admirably. from rm40.5 billion in 2005, the funds net worth adjusted (nwa) has grown 169% to rm108.9 billion as at dec 31, 2015. last week, the state-owned fund decided to take some profit as it trimmed its holdings in tenaga nasional bhd (tnb) by 1.45 percentage points. the disposal of 82 million shares, at rm14.30 per share, raised rm1.17 billion for khazanah. with tnbs share price up by almost 23% y-o-y, khazanah certainly cannot be faulted for taking profit at these levels. but the timing of the disposal does raise questions about how the funds will be deployed. the 2017 budget will be revealed in a months time, and it is no secret that the federal government is walking a tightrope in keeping the budget deficit at 3.1% this year with the fall in petroleum revenues. recall that khazanah last year paid out almost 100% of net profits in dividends  a record high. for fy2015, the fund paid dividends of rm1.05 billion against net profit of rm1.055 billion. post-dividends, khazanah only retained rm5 million. keep in mind that khazanah also had to fund the rm6 billion turnaround of malaysia airlinen system bhd, now known as malaysia airlines bhd (mab). against this backdrop, khazanahs borrowings shot up to rm46.46 billion, up 9.54% y-o-y, giving it a net gearing of 1.2 times as at december 2015. note that this takes into account the fact that khazanah last year raised rm1.6 billion from the disposal of 112 million tnb shares. furthermore, it excludes the us$750 million (rm3.15 billion) in us dollar-denominated straight sukuk that was issued in february this year. khazanah declined to comment for this story. a further cause for concern was the seemingly urgent nature in which the block of 82 million tnb shares were placed out last week. according to industry sources, the shares were placed via an accelerated book-building exercise. on top of that, the transaction price of rm14.30 was at the low end of the book-building range. it would be worrying if khazanah was forced to make less-than-ideal disposals in order to maintain dividend payouts. but to be fair, the tnb shares were disposed of at near-peak prices. furthermore, khazanah retains 28.26% equity in tnb worth rm22.9 billion. beyond tnb, khazanahs holdings in listed companies were estimated to be worth rm89.77 billion as at last friday. other than tnb, khazanahs seven listed stocks include axiata group bhd in which it has a 37.77% stake, cimb group holdings bhd (29.81%), ihh healthcare bhd (41.12%), uem sunrise bhd (66.06%), telekom malaysia bhd (28.65%) and malaysia airports holdings bhd (mahb) (36.71%). unlike tnb, however, the rest of the stocks on the portfolio have produced a lacklustre performance this year. mahb was the only other stock to gain substantially, up 17.6% y-o-y. ihh healthcare, uem sunrise and telekom all gained less than 3% y-o-y. meanwhile, cimb and axiata lost 5.46% and 12.41% of their market value in the same period. in a nutshell, if khazanah needs to trim its holdings in its listed companies to raise capital, this is not the right time. separately, khazanah has also explored other means to raise fresh capital. at the beginning of the month, it raised us$398.8 million (rm1.62 billion) from the issuance of an exchangeable sukuk for beijing enterprises water group ltd  an integrated water and sewage treatment solutions service provider in china. to be fair to khazanah, it does not appear to be milking its companies simply to upstream the dividends. the clearest example of this is the fact that axiata reduced its interim dividend by 15%, from eight sen per share to five sen per share (see story on page 20). it is also important to point out that khazanahs dividend contribution to the government is relatively small compared to the national budgets expenditure, which came to rm267 billion for 2016. in contrast to other revenue streams like the goods and services tax, which is expected to rake in rm39 billion this year, khazanahs contribution is also not significant. however, dividends alone may not be the only demand on khazanahs capital. mabs turnaround, while on track, is far from complete and still requires support from khazanah (see story on page 28). on top of that, the fund earlier this month announced that it would be developing taman tugu  a 26.7ha rainforest park that will cost an estimated rm650 million. note that about rm100 million of that budget is set aside for the maintenance and operation of the park over the next 12 years. put it all together and it is clear that steering khazanah is not an enviable task. (interestingly, khazanah last week saw a new addition to its board  second finance minister datuk johari abdul ghani.) the fund needs to pay dividends to a cash-strapped shareholder but paying too much could stifle the impressive growth that it has enjoyed over the past decade.

in august, its lowest since may 2003, but analysts expect it to stabilise and recover in the next few months. bank negara malaysias (bnm) monetary and financial developments statement for the month of august released last friday showed total loans in the banking system growing at 4.2% year-on-year while total net financing grew at 6.3% in august. these compared with loan growth and net financing growth of 5.1% and 6.8% respectively in july. the slower growth in net financing was driven mainly by the continued moderation in the growth of loans extended by the banking system and development financial institutions, the central bank said in the statement. this is the lowest loan growth recorded since may 2003, mainly dragged down by low business loan growth which came in at 1.9%, cimb research banking analyst winson ng told the edge financial daily when contacted. this was slower than julys 3.7%. bnm said this slower pace was the high base effect in august 2015 and large one-off loan repayments by a few of the domestic businesses. nevertheless, the central bank sounded a positive note, saying, the level of loans disbursed to businesses in fact increased, with a larger volume of loans extended to the wholesale and retail trade, and restaurants and hotels; manufacturing; and transport, storage and communication sectors. in particular, both the level and annual growth of loans disbursed to smes (small- and medium-enterprises) improved during the month, it added. meanwhile, household loans was stable growing at 5.7% unchanged from july. outstanding loans for the purchase of residential property also stabilised at 10.2%  the same rate as julys. the level of loan applications and loan approvals increased during the month for both businesses and households, said bnm. despite the lower-than-expected total loan growth in august, ng is not too pessimistic about the banking sector. loans are just one aspect for banks. year to date (ytd), the banking sector has outperformed the [fbm klci] index, he said. ng said his top pick for the banking sector is bimb holdings bhd, which he upgraded in a sept 23 note from hold to buy with a higher target price of rm4.80. the research house has tagged it as the top pick for malaysian banks, replacing rhb bank bhd, as it will be a key beneficiary of the employees provident funds simpanan shariah scheme to be launched in 2017. bimb is the only syariah-compliant banking stock. last friday, shares of bimb closed unchanged at rm4.14, for a market capitalisation of rm6.58 billion. meanwhile, etiqa insurance and takaful head of research, products and alternative investments chris eng opined that the low loan growth recorded in august is not something unexpected. it is low, but this is not a sudden surprise. loan growth has been slowing down for some time, he said when contacted. he opined that the stock market has fairly priced this in. in july, the loan growth slowed to 5.1% from 5.6% in june. early this year, some have forecast industry loan growth to range between 9% and 11%. the data over the past few months show that this is inaccurate, eng said. he expects loan growth to stabilise in the next few months and pick up by the end of the year. engs top pick for the banking sector is cimb group holdings bhd. shares of cimb closed 11 sen or 2.3% lower at rm4.71 last friday, for a market capitalisation of rm41.11 billion. ytd, the counter has risen 9.28%. another analyst who tracks the banking sector said augusts loan growth of 4.2% was way below his expectation. he also expressed concern over the weak business sentiment. it is way too low. also, the low business loan growth shows businesses are holding back. no one wants to do anything. the sentiment is really bad, he said when contacted. the analyst noted that in october last year, the business loan growth was at 11%. nevertheless, he concurred with engs view that loan growth will stabilise and recover in the next few

manufacturing division, the group recorded a pbt decline to rm24.4 million due to lower demand for in-house products from its concession business. amortisation charges from the phis system will continue to be a drag on the groups earnings. in 1hfy16, amortisation costs rose by 85% y-o-y to rm18.2 million, and they are set to increase going forward. as the group has only amortised up to rm68.5 million of the rm193.1 million spent on the system, amortisation is expected to be recurring and continue to impact earnings across the tenure of its concession agreement that ends in november 2019. on a positive note, the group declared a dividend per share (dps) of five sen, which brings 1hfy16 dps to nine sen. this translates into a 69.8% payout ratio, in line with our estimates of a 70% payout. however, we believe current dividend yields of 3.4% to 4.5% for financial year 2016 (fy16) to fy18 are not attractive enough to warrant interest in the stock given various earnings risks in sight. we believe that earnings will continue to be under pressure from higher amortisation charges for phis and an underperforming logistics division. with no surprises to the results, we keep our earnings forecasts unchanged. hence, our reduce call and 12-month sum-of-parts-based tp of rm5 remain. while dividend yields of 3.4% to 4.5% would appear to be decent for a healthcare stock, we believe that risk-return is unattractive given the earnings risks. we prefer ihh in the healthcare space. upside risks are lower amortisation charges and a spike in government orders.  cimb research,

the stock with the code 0069 started off its journey as a public-listed company with the name i-power bhd in 2005. it changed its name twice in the following 10 years, becoming instacom group bhd in 2012 and then finally, vivocom intl holdings bhd. its share price was barely eight sen nine months ago but soared to 36 sen last month. however, the share price has been drifting lower amid concerns that ceo datuk seri dr yeoh seong mok, who is perceived to be the key person who secures contracts from china railway construction corp ltd (ccrc), is retiring soon. it is rather common for companies to undertake restructuring exercises to revive their financial health. one route is to bring in a white knight to inject new business. this is what vivocom has done  twice. when i-power made its debut on the mesdaq market of bursa malaysia, it was an it solution provider founded by then-ceo jason chia kok chin. i-power was the first ibm corp premier business partner in the country to be inducted into ibms independent software vendor (isv) advantage programme. i-power was said to have priority access to ibms e-business application knowledge and expertise, including its technical infrastructure, resources and support. its initial public offering (ipo) was priced at 43 sen per share. subscribers must have laughed all the way to the bank when the share price almost doubled to 85 sen on its maiden trading day on jan 18, 2005, and continued to climb to a high of rm1.52 on march 30, 2005. but the upward momentum was unsustainable and the share price plunged to 40 sen a few months later. one needed a strong heart to hold on to the investment. the stock was on a roller coaster ride, fluctuating between 80 sen and rm1.40 until 2008, the last year in which i-power was profitable. in the financial year ended june 30, 2008, the company reported a net profit of rm12.57 million. the following financial year, the companys net profit plunged 99% to just rm136,904, citing the challenging business environment. while hoping for a better future, i-power posted a widest net loss of rm94.77 million in fy2010, wiping out its retained earnings and ending up with an accumulated loss of rm65.02 million. its share price dipped below 10 sen to a low of two sen in 2011  six years after the ipo. interestingly, i-powers board of directors, including its chairman tan sri wan sidek wan abd rahman and chias wife ha mun keet, started selling their shares in the company shortly after the ipo. by october 2008, none of the board members held i-power shares except chia, who held a 25.88% stake. did they have doubts when everyone thought things were rosy at the company? a white knight emerged in august 2011 in the form of telecommunication tower builder instacom engineering sdn bhd, which undertook a reverse takeover exercise. subsequently, i-power became instacom, with a new management as well as controlling shareholders. chia was redesignated executive director while anne kung soo ching became ceo. thomas ngu sing hieng and choo seng choon were appointed executive directors too. chia retired from his post on dec 18, 2012. as at april 2013, chan chuck yan was instacoms largest shareholder with a 21.79% stake, followed by kung, ngu and wong say khim, each holding a 14.52% stake. ea holdings bhd ceo mohammad sobri saad was the 12th largest shareholder, holding a 1.14% stake. although chia ceased to be notable shareholder, his wife was the 27th largest shareholder with a 0.35% stake. note that choo was also a non-executive director in ea holdings. ngu told the local media that instacom wanted to build a 3,000km fibre-optic cable network to link up the whole of peninsular malaysia in three to five years. this helped to fuel interest in the stock. once again, the stock with the code 0069 was a hot stock on bursa malaysia. from a trough of two sen, the share price surged to a high of 42.5 sen about one year after the reverse takeover. the rise in instacoms share price was also driven by market talk that it had secured a rm205 million contract for telecommunication infrastructure works in sarawak. instacom managed to deliver a good set of financial earnings. for financial year ended dec 31, 2013 (fy2013), instacom returned to the black after three consecutive years of fiscal losses. it reported a net profit of rm26.22 million against a net loss of rm2.87 million previously. however, in early september 2013, the companys directors started selling shares on the open market while instacom was making handsome profits. ngu was telling the investing public about instacoms bright prospects at briefings with investors and media interviews. interestingly, together with wong, he was paring his equity interest in the telco tower builder. less than two years after the reverse takeover, ngu and wongs shareholdings were down to 6.67% each as at may 2014. the equity interest of controlling shareholder chan was trimmed to 10% from 21.79%. the share sale by the substantial shareholders exerted pressure on instacoms share price, which fell to 21.5 sen from above 42 sen previously. again, had the substantial shareholders, who were also management executives, felt that something was not right when interest in the stock was growing? instacoms earnings shrank in the following two financial years. its profit decreased to rm3.7 million in fy2014  substantially lower than what the investing public, including institutional fund managers, had been expecting. the share price lost ground, drifting to 17 sen in october 2014 as the company failed to deliver the stellar earnings that it had promised investors. to cultivate a new revenue stream, instacom proposed to acquire a 35% stake in aluminium window and door manufacturer neata aluminium (m) sdn bhd for rm58.8 million from four individuals  the latters founder albert chia kok seng, ang li-hann, nor mohd amin shaharudin and ooi eng kean  in late 2014. the acquisition was settled via the issuance of new instacom shares. filings with companies commission malaysia show that neata reported a net profit of rm6.81 million for fy2014, a 3.38% decline from rm7.05 million in fy2013, backed by a revenue of rm64.35 million, which was 20.22% higher than rm53.53 million previously. however, the companys net profit for fy2012 was just rm708,666 while revenue was only rm6.49 million. the acquisition was completed in january last year. the equity interest in neata helped to boost instacoms earnings to rm8.79 million in fy2015. about six months later, instacom decided to raise its shareholding in neata to 78.6% by buying an additional 43.6% stake from golden oasis resources sdn bhd for rm73.58 million, which was settled with rm13 million cash and the issuance of new shares. consequently, golden oasis became the single largest shareholder in instacom with 24.5%. golden oasis is 70%-owned by ng boon sing, with the remaining stake held by nor haslinda abdul hamid. in a nutshell, this might have been seen as another reverse takeover exercise for the listed company, which changed its name to vivocom intl holdings bhd in january this year. for the third time, the stock with the code 0069 became a hot stock on bursa malaysia. since late september last year, when bursa approved instacoms proposal to raise its stake in neata, its price climbed from eight sen to 32.5 sen in november  a four-fold increase in three months.  on nov 2, instacom appointed yeoh as joint-ceo. yeoh is the founder of vivocom enterprise sdn bhd, which subsequently became a wholly-owned subsidiary of neata. from being a telco tower maker, vivocom has become a construction outfit. at press and investor briefings, vivocom claimed it was the sub-contractor for crcc in asean.  in a 26-page report dated nov 18, 2015, cimb research pegged vivocoms target price at 72 sen, citing potential job wins from crcc as a catalyst. share price catalysts are newsflow of contract wins from crcc throughout 2016 and a possible upgrade to the main board of bursa malaysia next year, said the unleashing the giant report. last thursday, vivocom announced that it had secured two contracts with a collective value of rm37.8 million. but the positive newsflow failed to stem the fall in its share price, which declined 32% from the peak of 36 sen last month. on the selling pressure, choo believes it was mainly due to the overall market conditions. this is beyond our control. under these conditions, even the most positive news would have little impact on the stock market, he says. will there be a different ending for the company this time around? perhaps the management could shed some light in the next briefing, as well as in the financial results for 2qfy2016.

20 - 26, 2016. for years, talk about water pipe makers being the best proxy for the national water agenda has been making the rounds. however, the political deadlock in negotiations between the federal and state governments over selangors water assets has led to investor fatigue. this is reflected in the lacklustre trading activity of such companies as engtex group bhd, jaks resources bhd, hiap teck venture bhd and yli holdings bhd. nevertheless, water pipe makers look set to excite investors again following positive news flows from the recent asia water 2016 conference, which saw the government affirming its commitment to the water reform agenda and solving selangors water restructuring exercise this year. recent contract wins by engtex and yli also sent a positive signal to investors that bigger things are coming soon for players in the sector. malaysia reportedly has 44,000km of old asbestos-cement (ac) pipes that have been wearing out over the years. leaks in these old pipes are the main contributor to the countrys high rate of non-revenue water (nrw) of above 35%. a major overhaul is urgently needed to solve the problem of water that is produced but lost before it reaches the consumers. the replacement market is estimated at more than rm10 billion, with half of the old ac pipes expected to be replaced by mild steel (ms) and ductile iron (di) pipes. last month, engtex secured a rm25 million contract from syarikat bekalan air selangor sdn bhd (syabas) to supply di pipes as part of the states water pipe replacement programme. in march, ylis subsidiary, laksana wibawa sdn bhd, was appointed to supply pipes, fittings and related products for the proposed development of the langat 2 water treatment plant project and water reticulation system in selangor for rm97.34 million. engtex managing director and founder datuk ng hook says the syabas contract will definitely be positive for the groups bottom line. the project is expected to have spillover effects on other water pipe makers as well. we cannot speculate on the chances of winning future tenders, but we are seeing positive signs with the first tender being awarded, ng tells the edge. he says the selangor water pipe replacement programme is worth an estimated rm1 billion, and engtex hopes to secure a significant portion of it. apart from the rm25 million di pipe contract, we aim to bid for all tenders to be awarded by syabas or pengurusan aset air bhd, he says. the group is also actively bidding for jobs from ongoing water pipe replacement programmes in other states. engtex is the exclusive pipe supplier for six states  perlis, perak, penang, johor, negeri sembilan and melaka. there are very few players that have the capability to supply pipes like us. thats why we hope to secure a significant share of the market with our financial strength and sizeable capacity. we are also able to supply to states where we are not exclusive [such as selangor]. it shows our competitiveness and capabilities, ng says. engtex is now ready to tap the water pipe replacement market. its di pipe plant is only 30% utilised, and its ms pipe plant, about 70%. we have a proven track record as well as ample pipe capacity to cater for more demand. we are upgrading our plants further to remain competitive, ng adds. engtex is one the countrys largest manufacturers for di pipes, which are of smaller diameter, and larger-diameter ms pipes. it operates a di pipe plant in gebeng industrial estate in pahang, and a ms pipe plant in serendah, selangor. it is worth noting that engtex has secured close to rm100 million of contracts out of the rm230 million tendered for the langat 2 water treatment plant. of the rm100 million, the company will be delivering rm60 million in the current financial year ending dec 31, 2016 (fy2016). engtex is targeting to grow its top line by 10% to 15% in fy2016, with the water pipe replacement project expected to be a key growth driver, says ng. while the group will continue to pay dividends to its shareholders, it will focus more on paring its debt this year to lighten its balance sheet, he adds. with our current order book of rm109 million and tender book amounting to rm507 million, we are optimistic about a better performance in fy2016 will be better. our proven track record and reliability will be a plus point to win more contracts in the future. ng says engtexs share price performance has yet to reflect its growth potential, especially with the many water infrastructure projects coming onstream. our share price is actually trading below the current net tangible asset value of rm1.65. we believe the current single-digit per (price-earnings ratio) is quite low and we should be trading at double-digit per, given our growth story. engtex currently trades at a per of 8.18 times, compared with jaks resources 10.14 times, while yli and hiap teck are making losses (see table). ng says the new nrw master plan will benefit local pipe players. he believes in the the revival of the water infrastructure theme this year as the nrw problem is getting worse, at 35.6% in 2014. the government has indicated that key projects will still have to be implemented, such as langat 2 and other water treatment plants and pipe replacements, to reduce nrw to 25% by 2020. these have to be done to support future economic development, he says. from the point of view of fundamentals, hong leong investment bank bhd dealer representative frank lin says engtex is the best stock to buy at the moment, compared with the other water pipe counters. however, he cautions that the awarding of government contracts is full of pitfalls and surprises. one should also not discount the possibility of imports tilting the balance. this is an old problem for the whole nation, not just for selangor, as many of these pipes were during the colonial days. given the resources, all the old pipes need to be replaced in all states, but we should not discount the fact that pipes can be imported too, lin tells the edge. if the authorities are serious about the replacement project, all the pipe makers will get a piece of the action for many years to come, he adds. i am of the opinion that the orders will be distributed to most of the pipe makers, although unevenly, to cut the risk of non-performance on the part of the suppliers, says lin. in an april 8 report, cimb research analyst sharizan rosely said major water pipe manufacturers, including engtex, yli, hiap teck and jaks resources, are likely to benefit strongly from the new nrw masterplan. engtex is already a big potential beneficiary of the larger-diameter pipes needed for the langat 2 water treatment plant in selangor. the launch of the master plan could kick off a slew of new pipe replacement works nationwide and will be positive for yli, hiap teck and jaks too, he noted."}, "64": {"date_posted": "17/6/2016", "title": "berjaya food bounces from two-year low", "article": " kuala

break, berjaya food rose three sen or 1.91% to rm1.60, with 1.86 million shares traded. it traded as high as rm1.63 earlier. after announcing an 87.12% drop in its net profit for the fiscal year ended april 30, 2016 (fy16) on june 10, berjaya food shares fell by 16.49% to close at rm1.58 yesterday (june 16), the lowest since july 7, 2014's rm1.573. since the beginning of june, the counter fell 37 sen or 19.47%, as it was traded at rm1.90 at end of may. berjaya food's dismal fy16 results, according to cimb investment bank bhd (cimb ib), was due to softer performances by its indonesian kenny rogers roasters (krr) chain and jollibean in singapore. higher effective tax rates and higher operating costs due to a stronger us dollar also put a dampener on the group's earnings. cimb ib analyst kristine wong has trimmed her earnings estimates for berjaya food's fy17 and fy18, which consequently reduces the target price as well. but even so, her new target price of rm2.02 (previously rm2.35) still gives an implied upside of 27.85% from yesterday's closing of rm1.58. she also maintained her \"add\" call on berjaya food in a note on june 12. \"while berjaya food's fy16 core net profit came in below expectations, we expect the group's earnings performance to improve in tandem with the anticipated recovery in consumer spending and continued closure of loss-making stores for krr indonesia and malaysia, which are potential catalysts. the group should also post stronger results in fy17 as it pares down its debt,\" she explained. hong leong investment bank research, which initiated its coverage on berjaya food on june 14, had a \"hold\" call, given the limited upside to its target price at the time the note was published. but at the last trading price, its target price of rm1.83 could give investors a 14.38% upside. its head of research and economist sia ket ee said starbucks' same-store sales growth (sssg) grew by 5% in fy16, despite weak consumer sentiment. a gradual recovery in consumer spending in the second half of this year should also see a pick-up in sssg growth, he said. sia said starbucks plans to open 25 outlets every year through 2019. with a low penetration ratio compared to singapore and america, he said there is room for the coffee chain to grow further in malaysia. \"currently, starbucks (in malaysia) has a low outlet penetration ratio (number of outlets per million population) at 6.7 compared to singapore (21.2) and america (39.3),\" he said. each outlet is expected to generate sales of rm2 million or so every year, he added.

index managed to surpass the key 62% fibonacci retracement (fr) level of 1,728.54 to a recent high of 1,729.13 on april 14, 2016. very heavy liquidation at that level had caused the index to decline and move into a downward phase for its 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages (sma) with a dead cross on its short-term daily chart. the indexs price bars are now below the 50-day and 200-day daily sma and this depicts a downward phase for the fbm klci in the medium to longer term. medium- to longer-term prospects look bleaker as the weekly 50-day and 200-day sma have also issued a dead cross in june 2016. any bargain hunting on the index will be met by heavy longer-term selling on rallies. the indexs daily signals are weaker, with all its commodity channel index (cci), directional movement index (dmi), oscillator and stochastic depicting very obvious sell signals. the moving average convergence divergence (macd) remains positive for now. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are

management consultancy, infrastructure maintenance, integrated facilities management, and also develops and manages properties.  a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that three research houses cover this stock, with two hold and a buy calls. maybank-ib does not cover uem edgenta on a fundamental basis. its chart trend on the daily and weekly time frames is firmly down. from a daily wave c and recent high of rm3.98 (may 2016), its prices have plunged 19.1% on the daily and weekly time frames to a daily wave 3 low of rm3.22 (june 2016). as prices broke above their recent key critical support levels of rm3.56 and rm3.61, look to sell uem edgenta on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to medium- term downtrends for this stock. the daily indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) have issued clear sell signals and now show firm and obvious indications of uem edgentas eventual plunge towards much lower levels. it would attract very weak buying activities at the support levels of rm2.96, rm3.16 and rm3.22. we expect uem edgenta to witness very heavy activities at its resistance levels of rm3.27, rm3.56 and rm3.61.

general hospital (cgh), changi airport terminal 3 and terminal 4, and the singapore ministry of home affairs. they were impressed that stream is a globally competitive product that could even beat envacs automated waste collection system for singapore government projects, where stringent quality control and security are paramount considerations. the questions from participants centred on: i) margins for the three businesses  facilities, environment and engineering, and their various sub-segments; and ii) the growth potential of the various divisions. we believe that the long-term structural story for awc is positive. as land becomes scarcer in the klang valley, high-end and high-rise office or residential buildings will widen streams and qudotech sdn bhds (qdt) addressable markets. regulatory requirements for new and refurbished hdb developments to use pneumatic waste collection systems will also expand streams opportunities. in malaysia, the signature tower win opens up ample opportunities for qdt to secure plumbing jobs for other high-rise buildings at the tun razak exchange. following a site visit to cgh, we believe that hospitals are a new potential growth area for stream as our visit revealed that pneumatic linen collection is being overlooked by most hospitals. under the conventional system, there is a risk of cross-infection among patients when soiled and infected linen are transported manually through hospital corridors using open trolleys. we maintain our earnings per share forecasts and sum-of-parts (sop)-based tp. management remains bullish about awcs earnings visibility for the financial year ending june 30, 2016 (fy16) to fy18. the stock is attractively valued at 9.3 times fy17 price earnings ratio (per) and fy17f (forecast) ex-cash per of 6.1 times. key risks to the achievement of our tp include project execution and delays. potential rerating catalysts are contract wins and special dividends.  cimb research, june 4"}, "69": {"date_posted": "1/6/2016", "title": "rspo unperturbed by members' actions", "article": " this article first appeared in corporate, the edge malaysia weekly, on may 16 - 22, 2016. ioi corp bhds legal challenge last monday against the roundtable on sustainable palm oils (rspo) suspension of its certification effective april 4 may be seen as a setback for the not-for-profit organisation, although some choose to see it differently. ioi corp says it is taking legal action against the rspo board of governors over the suspension of the certification for the entire ioi group. the company is contending that the suspension should not take effect against its downstream operation and its existing certified palm oil purchase and sales contracts prior to the suspension. recall that the suspension came about after aidenvironment, a consultancy providing services and research in sustainable production and trade, filed complaints with rspo in relation to ioi groups indonesian plantations  pt sukses karya sawit, pt berkat nabati sawit and pt bumi sawit sejahtera. the offences include non-compliance with the rspo certification systems regulations, failing to submit necessary documentation and non-adherence to rspo principles and criteria. in a statement last monday, ioi corp ceo datuk lee yow chor calls the decision to challenge the rspo suspension difficult and painful. the legal action is independent of the remedial steps ioi corp is taking to comply with the rspo agenda but some claim that this undermines the impact of rspos work. eric wakker, director at aidenvironment asia, says the legal action has undermined trust in the companys management. what does this tell the world? it tells the world that ioi expects rspo to green stamp its palm oil whilst it refuses to be held accountable against the formal rules, to which it had voluntarily subscribed through its membership. that impression will be extremely difficult for iois management to correct now and this means that iois buyers will likely sustain their suspensions well beyond the point where rspo might lift it. we were making fair progress. in fact, the discussions were of a kind completely unthinkable prior to the suspension. then, iois management files this lawsuit. this suggests that everything that we have achieved with iois staff may be undone, he says. according to ioi corp, the three affected plantations produce only 2% of the companys palm oil. in an earlier statement warning investors of the suspension, ioi group claimed that the only effect is that the company will not be able to earn the certified sustainable palm oil (cspo) premium, which represents less than 0.5% of the groups revenue. yet, the damage done to ioi corp could be far greater, given that the suspension was on the entire group. in his statement last monday, lee says the suspension has caused significant disruptions to certain segments of the european and american food manufacturing sector and affected the groups many stakeholders. we, therefore, believe the scope and effect of the suspension decision is highly disproportionate to the findings by the panel, and the decision has not duly taken into account the corrective actions taken by us and verified by an rspou2013accredited auditor during the one-year period between the complaint and the decision dates, he says. the companys share price has fallen over 6% since its rspo certification was suspended. ioi corps bonds are at risk of being downgraded by moodys investors services due to uncertainty regarding the companys operating performance, particularly the downstream business. meanwhile, long-standing customers like unilever, kellogg, mars and nestlu00e9 have announced that they would cease to source from ioi corp. customers with beyond rspo purchasing policies that are stricter and more ambitious than the basic requirements of rspo are demanding more from their suppliers. so, ioi corps action plan to push itself back within the perimeters of rspo certification may not be sufficient to win purchasers back. for instance, unilever says it wants ioi to address and remediate the proven complaints and to demonstrate its commitment to fundamentally and transparently change the way it drives sustainable palm oil development to meet the highest social and environmental standards. nestlu00e9, in an email to the edge, says, we have now carried out an assessment of iois action plan, which it claims is designed to deliver on the groups commitment to non-deforestation in its operations. our conclusion is that it does not go far enough in tackling the issues raised by iois rspo suspension and that nestlu00e9 will, therefore, not award any new business to ioi group with immediate effect. we will also phase out all existing contracts with an expected completion date of aug 31, 2016. another setback to the rspo agenda is felda global ventures holdings bhd (fgv) and the felda groups request for an immediate withdrawal of rspo principles and criteria certificates of its 58 mills located throughout malaysia, effective may 3. with that, existing cspo in stock with fgv will be deemed uncertified. its kernel crushing plants and downstream refineries are not affected. fgv says its withdrawal allows it to roll out sustainable practices programmes with 102,100 smallholders throughout the country. a report by chain reaction research alleged that the rspo credentials were already in doubt because of the clearing of 880ha of high conservation value peat land. cimb research, in a may 3 note, says, the decision could be linked partly to the alleged breach of labour conditions at their plantations in the treatment of workers, which has led to the suspension of their pasoh palm oil mill. others speculate that a withdrawal before suspension by rspo is a kind of damage limitation move. the rspo certification process is lengthy, complicated and costly. that fgv chose to withdraw and give up the premium cspo commands while it is still in compliance with the rspo standards raises eyebrows. some are worried that fgv could be setting an example for other non-complying firms to withdraw before they are hit by sanctions, diminishing the effect of rspos work. however, rspo says the impact of its work is found in the numbers. it has certified 2.72 million ha of palm oil production area. a total of 12.9 million tonnes or 21% of global palm oil is certified by rspo  51% from indonesia and 42% from malaysia. removing ioi and fgv (the worlds largest crude palm oil producer and third largest oil palm plantation operator respectively) from the loop will present rspo with a volume problem. that, though, is the natural result of rspos work. rspo ceo datuk darrel webber explains, although suspension of a member is never a desirable outcome, it is also a part of the accountability process that grants credibility to the rspo certification system and keeps the rspo accountable to all stakeholders, including consumers. in that sense, the suspension of the ioi group and everything that has flowed from it is proof of a system that is working, he says. while it remains to be seen how the swiss court will decide, what is certain is that ioi corps and the felda groups actions have raised questions that will likely dominate discussions at the european roundtable meeting in milan next month."}, "70": {"date_posted": "1/6/2016", "title": "umwog bags drilling rig provision contract from petronas", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on june 1,

rig for an undisclosed value. in a statement to the bourse, umwog said it will assign its umw naga 6 rig for the contract for a duration of two years. the contract also carries a one-year extension option. umw naga 6 is a premium independent-leg cantilever jack-up rig that has a drilling depth capability of 30,000 feet (9,144m), and has a rated operating water depth of 375 feet, said the group. it said the contract will contribute positively to the groups earnings and net assets for the financial year ending dec 31, 2016 (fy16). the winning came amid analysts bearish view of the stock, on concerns that the oil and gas services providers earnings may continue to be under pressure due to the weak demand for oil rigs and drilling service, coupled with the declining charter rates for jack-up rigs. this has prompted them to revise umwogs full-year core net loss forecast for fy16 to fy18 by 35% to 84%, in anticipation of a lower average rig utilisation going forward. it is difficult for jack-up rig services provider to find employment for their rigs. jack-up rigs are used for the exploration part of the oil and gas value chain, and exploration capital expenditure is the first to be cut in a sustained oil price bear market, cimb research said in a note dated may 24. alliancedbs research shared the same sentiments, saying five out of eight of umwogs drilling rigs are still

8.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) due to lower sales across star medias key operating segments on the back of poor consumer sentiment and uncertainty in the domestic economy. as a result, star medias net profit dropped 41.7% y-o-y to rm15.5 million from rm26.5 million. as we had expected, it did not declare any dividend in the quarter. print and digital segment revenue fell 12.7% y-o-y. management attributed the decline to lower newspaper advertising expenditure (adex), which decreased 12.3% y-o-y. in addition, we believe star media was also negatively impacted by the continuous decline in print circulation volume. we project a 6% decline in star medias circulation volume in fy16. we expect adex to remain subdued in 2016, given the domestic economic uncertainties in the wake of the ringgits depreciation against other currencies and lower commodity prices. furthermore, we expect the print segment to face continued headwinds in 2016 due to the structural shift in adex towards the digital platform. overall, we expect the print adex to fall 3% in fy16. nevertheless, we are encouraged to learn that star media has successfully narrowed down its losses for the event, exhibition, interior and thematic segment, which posted a narrower operating loss of rm1.8 million in 1qfy16 versus rm5.3 million in 1qfy15. management attributed the improvement to higher project and event

rm59.4 million from rm137.68 million a year ago. revenue fell 26.7% to rm424.4 million, from rm579.01 million, the year before. at the time of writing, genting plantations share price had tapered off from a high of rm11.56 in february, just before the companys fy2015 financial results were released, to trade at rm10.62. the companys warrants, genp-wa, offer a slightly lower entry point to investors eyeing the companys shares. the warrants were trading at rm2.72 apiece last wednesday and were at a slight discount to the underlying share. the company had issued the warrants that can be exercised anytime up to their expiry on june 17, 2019, based on a 1:1 ratio at an exercise price of rm7.75. based on that last price, genp-wa is trading at a 1.44% discount to the underlying share, which closed at rm10.62 last wednesday. meanwhile, there is reason to believe things could get better this year. first, the company expects its fresh fruit bunch (ffb) production to improve in 2016. according to cimb research  which is neutral on the sector, but has genting plantations as one of its top stock picks  the planter will maintain its 6% to 7% ffb production growth for 2016 despite lower rainfall at some of the companys estates in 2h2015. the group indicated that its peninsular malaysia estates may report a 4% rise in ffb output and its estates in indonesia a 43% jump. this is expected to soften the impact of the projected 7% drop in output from its sabah estates this year. secondly, cpo and palm kernel prices are starting to pick up again after a subdued 2015. year to date, the cpo price has averaged rm2,485 per tonne. cimb research is forecasting that cpo will trade at an average of rm2,450 per tonne in fy2016 and rm2,600 in 2017. this is a significant improvement from last years prices. in fy2015, the average prices of cpo and palm kernel were rm2,122 and rm1,552 per tonne, a decline of 11% and 7% respectively from the year before. meanwhile, malaysias palm oil inventory fell to a 14-month low of 1.8 million tonnes, after five straight months of decline, in april. while palm oil exports softened at the start of the year, malaysias cpo exports are climbing again. in the first 10 days of this month, cpo exports improved 22% from a month earlier. analysts note that the upcoming hari raya aidilfitri should continue to support cpo exports for the

roll-outs under the 11th malaysia plan, particularly those transportation-related ones. the bursa malaysia construction index, meanwhile, has risen by 5.09% since jan 4 this year. while some might argue that the sector is fully valued, industry analysts believe there are still gems among the construction stocks. they have identified a handful of stocks with upside potential in the second half of this year. cimb research analyst sharizan rosely described the pipeline of jobs in the industry as the sectors all-time high, noting that sector drivers continue to be public transport, oil and gas downstream infrastructure, and water infrastructure. spillover from china contractor-driven projects is shaping up to be a stronger driver too, he said in his sector report dated april 20. according to the construction industry development board (cidb), between january and march this year, there were 677 construction projects awarded to both local and foreign builders, regardless of government or private sector jobs. they are collectively worth some rm11.91 billion. while the figures are significantly lower than that of 1,756 jobs worth rm35.32 billion awarded in the same period last year, sharizan remains upbeat about the sector. citing cidb data, sharizan said the total addressable jobs from 2016 is likely to be rm143 billion. last year, total jobs awarded were 6,885, with a combined project value of rm124.38 billion. muhibbah engineering (m) bhd remains our preferred mid-cap [stock] pick. on china-plays, vivocom intl holdings bhds job flow outlook looks strong in the medium term, he added. for midf research analyst fadhli dzulkifly, he opined that the current risk-aversion mode sweeping the market is intermittent. we remain sanguine about the prospect of [a] 9% growth for the construction sector as we reckon that the sector cycle has yet to reach its end stage relative to its schedule of project roll-outs in the 11th malaysia plan, such as the light rail transit 3 (lrt3), klang valley mass rapid transit 2, the pengerang intergrated petroleum complex and the kuala lumpur-singapore high-speed railway project, he said in his report dated may 19. fadhli recommends that investors take on a long position as the risk-reward is compelling. he has a positive rating on the industry, preferring stocks like gamuda bhd, muhibbah and vivocom. an analyst who declined to be named said it is not too late for investors to join the stock rally, particularly construction stocks listed on the ace market. large-market capitalisation companies may have divisional risk, meaning to say that their earnings might be dragged by other subsidiaries, he told the edge financial daily. taking a contrarion view, publicinvest research analyst tan siang hing believes that the construction sector is already fully valued. construction [stocks] are news-flow driven, but we are more into valuation play. some of the bigger players are valuing at 18 times per (price-earnings ratio); some of the smaller ones have already hit 15 to 16 times per, he said. tan added that moving forward, contractors will find it more and more difficult to achieve double-digit profit margins for the jobs they secured, due to escalating material costs and resource constraints, especially labour shortage. having said that, tan is of the view that bumiputera companies such as ahmad zaki

decline in traditional instruments like stocks and bonds during the current downturn has prompted fund managers to look for new strategies to deliver returns to investors. one such strategy is to use inverse exchange-traded funds to short-sell certain markets and sectors to reap extra earnings.  playing catch-up in his new role, tehs main challenge is to enhance the performance of the existing funds that have been lagging behind their peers in the past two years. he is targeting to generate an average return of 8% to 9% per annum for all funds at the end of next year. teh says the underperformance of the funds is due mainly to the plunge in crude oil prices over the last two years. the fund managers were late to cut losses and a small portion of these loss-making stocks were still in the portfolios when he conducted a review of the funds when he came back. the funds performance weakened when oil prices fell in the second half of 2014. they [the fund managers] thought there would be a rebound. the funds still had small holdings of oil and gas stocks because the fund managers were reluctant to sell due to their wrong calls earlier. this is a situation i dont want. apart from that, some of the funds were holding on to too many stocks. one of the things i did was to reduce the number of stocks and make sure that each fund was not holding more than 40 stocks. every stock in the funds now is a conviction call, teh says. to tighten the investment process and portfolio reviews, teh has become the devils advocate, constantly challenging the decisions of his fund managers and scrutinising each funds portfolio. meanwhile, he altered the firms investment style to a more tactical and nimble one. honestly, we hadnt made that many tactical decisions in the past few years. while there is nothing wrong with that, as it is a different investment style, [the funds] would be rewarded with additional value by being active in the current volatile market, he says. teh also plans to bring back the innovative spirit of pacific mutual. in the past, the firm was one of the first in malaysia to launch a syariah fund and absolute return fund but it has since lagged behind in new product offerings. currently, pacific mutual has 23 funds with a total assets under management of rm1.2 billion. apart from the roar fund, the firm has launched two other funds this year, including the pacific emerging market bond fund. another three income-centric funds are expected to be launched in the second half of the year, including a global shariah fund.  beware of liquidity and stay nimble  looking ahead, pacific mutual bhd ceo and chief investment officer teh chi-cheun says liquidity is the main theme investors should keep an eye on this year. thus, they should be nimble in their investments. he points out that the negative interest rate policy implemented by the european central bank and boj has created ample liquidity in the equity markets. if the peoples bank of china cuts interest rates further due to slow economic growth, more liquidity will be coming into the market in search of yields. at the end of the day, liquidity has to find a hole. and when this happens, stock valuations get pushed up and could go higher. this is what we are seeing now. anything that gives a return of more than 1% is still better than a negative rate. there is the whole mentality change there, says teh. when liquidity and valuations are high, teh says the main risk for investors is the divergence of monetary policy between the us fed and other major central banks. market participants also have contrasting views of the market, leading to different investment decisions and swings in the equity markets. this is why investors should stay nimble, explains teh. he also believes the commodity cycle has bottomed out, especially crude oil, which has remained stable at more than us$40 a barrel despite opec last month failing to agree on imposing a freeze on oil production. at the same time, the chinese economy seems to be turning around, judging from the numbers coming out of the republic, and the prospects for emerging markets are starting to look positive. teh says he is overweight on the china and hong kong markets. if you had asked me a month ago, i would have said the us, but now im looking at going back to asia. chinas construction sector is one of tehs favourites because of the one belt, one road initiative proposed by its president xi jin ping. the aim is to establish an economic belt that includes countries on the original silk road (starting at xi an in china, to istanbul, moscow and venice) and the maritime road (starting at fuzhou in china, passing kuala lumpur and nairobi and ending in venice). the initiative will also redirect chinas domestic overcapacity in basic metals and capital for regional infrastructure development to improve trade and relations in asean, central asia and europe. many of the countries that are a part of the initiative are now members of the asian infrastructure investment bank, which is a china-led international financial institution that aims to support the building of infrastructure in asia-pacific. one of these infrastructure projects is indonesias jakarta-bandung high-speed rail. the malaysian government has also agreed to the chinese initiative in developing a deep-sea port and ocean park at the malacca gateway as part of its backing. theyve this big plan. and as they execute it part by part, there will be more spending on infrastructure and construction, says teh. looking at malaysia, he says the market has benefited from the stabilisation of the chinese economy and the recovery in oil prices. he also singles out cimb bank bhd and wct holdings bhd as companies he likes going forward. we like cimb because the banks restructuring is going on well and theyve adopted proactive asset optimisation measures. their malaysian operation is growing strong. on top of that, they might be looking for investment banks as their regional partners, which would enhance their value. and yes, cimb is synonymous with its chairman datuk seri nazir razak. and if he does leave, it will have a negative impact on the bank. having said that, i honestly think the impact should not last more than a quarter. this is because he has hired good people to run the bank. he has put in capable people. we like wct because theyre bidding for several projects, including the pan-borneo highway, mrt2 and lrt3. and obviously, theyre very efficient in what they do.  what is an inverse etf? an inverse etf essentially consists of a basket of securities that mirror the movement of a certain index and is traded like a common share on a stock exchange. while it works in the same way as an etf, the difference is that the latter is constructed from various derivatives. these derivatives could include swap agreements, forward contracts, futures contracts and options. inverse etfs are structured to grow in value when the price of certain stock indexes decline in value. for example, if the nasdaq 100 index moves up 1% today, an inverse etf that provides inverse exposure to the same index (such as proshares short qqq) should drop by 1%, and vice versa.  riding the bear market (pt 1)"}, "76": {"date_posted": "20/5/2016", "title": "airasia active, rises 0.43% on favourable

level was spot on with our projection of 1.8 million tonnes. however, the inventory figure was 1% below bloomberg consensus and reuters estimates of 1.82 million tonnes due to lower-than-expected output. on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, stocks fell 18% due to the 23% decline in output.  we are neutral on this news as the declining stockpile is broadly in line with expectations. we expect the market to focus on exports in the coming month in view of the upcoming hari raya aidilfitri festival in july. for the first 10 days of april, malaysian palm oil exports rose 22% against the same period in the previous month. our initial tentative estimates suggest that palm oil stocks will decline by 3% m-o-m this month to 1.74 million tonnes. we project that may production and exports of palm oil will rise by 8% and 10% m-o-m respectively.  malaysia has maintained export tax of 5% for crude palm oil (cpo) effective may 1, 2016, while indonesia has imposed an export tax of us$3 (rm12)

basis, as we expect the 6% y-o-y rise in the local cpo price (1q16: rm2,404 per tonne) to only partly offset the 10% y-o-y drop in cpo output. the rise in cpo price is not sufficient to offset lower output due to competition from other edible oils and weaker demand from china. we expect cpo prices to trade in the range of rm2,500 to rm2,900 per tonne this month, and an average rm2,450 per tonne

continues to be gloomy, lbs bina group bhds shares are climbing steadily. they closed at a near two-year high of rm1.59 last friday. talking to the companys managing director tan sri lim hock san, one might be forgiven for thinking the property market is actually doing well, for he is targeting another record-breaking year for the group with sales of rm1.2 billion. this is thanks to new launches in the pipeline with a combined gross development value of more than rm1.9 billion (see table). if market conditions were good, our property sales would be even higher, at rm1.5 billion or rm1.8 billion, but we dont want to over-promise, lim tells the edge. the 850-acre bandar saujana putra (bsp) and 175-acre disland residence, which accounted for 80% of lbs sales last year, are expected to remain the anchor contributors, contributing 75% to sales this year. moving forward, lbs is planning a major development on a 34.7-acre parcel  its last  in bsp. comprising apartments, offices, a hotel and a shopping mall, the projects gdv is estimated at rm2 billion to rm3 billion. we saved the best for last, smiles lim. hopefully, the plan will become clearer in the next few months. for us, this is a big challenge and i will personally monitor the project. in its financial year ended dec 31, 2015 (fy2015), lbs net profit grew 8.7% year on year to rm76 million or 14.08 per share while revenue rose 1.8% to rm680 million. in fy2016, management expects net profit to climb to rm80 million to rm85 million on higher revenue of rm750 million to rm800 million. the groups financial performance will be backed by its strong unbilled sales, which stood at rm1.1 billion as of end-february, mainly from its 16 ongoing projects. it is worth noting that lbs has a 60% stake in zhuhai international circuit, which owns a racing circuit on 264 acres in zhuhai, china.  last month, lbs finally kick-started its long-awaited zic upgrading and transformation plan by launching the melaka cultural and trade centre there, consisting of a cultural museum, a one-stop tourism centre and an exhibition hall. next, the group will build two more functional areas there, namely the motor sports and services amenities zone and the tourism zone, which will feature a motorsport-themed hotel, a world-class theme park and a factory outlet for premium brands. lim says the racing circuit will be closed for a year, paving the way for the mega-project to be completed within two years. he declines, however, to estimate the gdv as the plan has yet to be finalised. he adds: we have received many joint-venture offers as the racing circuit is expected to attract two million to four million people a year. as a group, lbs cannot just depend on property development. we need to have some recurring income, which is why we will be adopting a profit-sharing model on the premium outlet and theme park. apart from its landbank in china, lbs owns more than 2,800 acres across malaysia, which have an estimated gdv of rm22 billion. about 48% of the land is located in johor, a quarter in the klang valley, 9% in pahang and the remaining 18% in perak and sabah. lbs, which morphed into a property developer with a focus on townships and medium-cost mass housing, achieved record-high property sales of rm1.029 billion last year.  cimb research initiated coverage of the property company in early march  before kumpulan wang persaraan emerged as a substantial shareholder in the company with 5.5% equity interest at the end of the month. lim, 58, says the investing public has started to recognise lbs again as a growth stock and dividend play among the property counters. kwap has been following us for many years. it was very difficult to get them to come in but we somehow managed to convince them. for us, this is an endorsement because their action speaks louder than words. lim, who is the eldest son of lbs founding chairman, datuk seri lim bock seng, took the helm of the company in december 2001. the familys private vehicle  gaterich sdn bhd  controls 55.57% of the company. with kwaps entry, lim is hoping lbs will see stronger interest from foreign institutional funds, especially those from china and hong kong. he, however, acknowledges that it may take some time. today, we are one of the largest property companies in malaysia among those with a market capitalisation of below rm1 billion but some fund managers are still reluctant to buy our shares, he remarks. its not for us to judge whether we are a first-tier or second-tier developer. but i believe that once we have hit the rm1 billion mark, we should be able to attract more institutional investors.  a quick check on bloomberg shows that the likes of koperasi permodalan felda malaysia bhd, pacific mutual fund bhd and aia bhd are listed as lbs shareholders. institutional investors currently hold about 20% of the company, of which less than 5% is owned by foreign funds. in a march 2 report, cimb research analyst saw xiao jun says lbs has been off the radar screen of most fund managers due its relatively small size but that it is only a matter of time before it starts to attract institutional investors. it is poised to become one of the few developers capable of delivering strong sales in the current market. the stock has risen 13.5% since cimb research initiated coverage on march 2, giving the company a market capitalisation of rm877.1 million as at last friday. the research house has a target price of rm1.85 for the stock. according to lim, it is lbs immediate target to achieve a market capitalisation of rm1 billion. after that, we can think of rm1.2 billion or rm1.5 billion. we want to enhance shareholders value and for people to enjoy investing in our company. he opines that lbs can be considered a high-growth stock with potential catalysts and which provides a decent dividend yield of around 7%. based on its closing price of rm1.59 last friday, lbs is trading at a rolling 12-month price-earnings ratio of 11 times and a price-book-value ratio of 0.8 times.

(pt 1)", "article": " this article first appeared in personal wealth, the edge malaysia weekly, on march 7 - 13, 2016.  in volatile times like these, exchange-traded funds could play a bigger role in an investors portfolio. with some knowledge of macroeconomics and technical analysis, investors could trade in etfs to generate a higher return.  global economic growth is expected to be sluggish this year and the volatility in stock markets shows no signs of abating. in times like these, exchange-traded funds (etfs), which tend to be overlooked by local investors, could have a role to play in an investors portfolio. one strategy is to include etfs in your investment portfolio to broadly ride the market. etfs also provide investors access to markets around the globe that continue to outperform even in a downturn. with some knowledge of macroeconomics and technical analysis, investors could trade in etfs during market volatility to generate a higher return. etfs adopt a passive investment approach by tracking the performance of an index and, to a certain extent, the broader market. mahdzir othman, ceo of i-vcap management sdn bhd, says that by allocating a portion of your investment portfolio to etfs, you can create some predictability in its performance. lets say you allocate 20% to 30% of your investment portfolio to etfs. this part of your investment wont swing too far away from the markets performance. the rest of your funds could be allocated to actively managed funds or [individual] stocks. the etfs will anchor your [satellite] portfolio, he explains. mahdzir says in a volatile market, investors can also use etfs to hedge against an actively managed unit trust fund, which depends on the skill of the fund manager to pick stocks he believes will outperform the market. an investor could buy into a growth fund that invests in local equities and at the same time, buy into an etf that broadly tracks the performance of the fbm klci, which the unit trust fund is benchmarked against. you are buying into the market when you buy into etfs, and you are buying into a fund managers skill when you buy into a unit trust fund. the two funds can actually complement each other, he adds. when the market does well and the unit trust fund outperforms the market, you could have returns on both sides. if the fund manager doesnt perform well when the market is good, the etf  which tracks the broader market  can serve as a hedge.  finding opportunities in the broader market etfs provide investors with access to diverse markets that they previously had no access to. this allows investors to seek out a wider spectrum of investment opportunities in volatile times. an example can be found in singapore, home to about 90 etfs. looking at the exchange traded funds trading summary december 2015 provided by the singapore exchange, the most actively traded etf last year was the ishares msci india index etf, which made up 20.2% of the total etf turnover. this is because the firms and investors there could not invest directly in the indian market. but the market was performing so well at one point last year, so they invested using etfs. it is an easy way into the market, says mahdzir. last year, indias equities market was one of the top picks of fund managers around the world because of its insulation from the global economic headwinds. the oil price crash had sent the emerging markets into a sea of red and slower demand did not bode well for developed nations. however, india was an exception. it benefited from low oil prices as it was a net oil importer and its domestic demand remained robust even as global demand slowed. the spdr gold shares, the largest physically backed gold etf in the world, was the second most traded etf on the singapore exchange last year, making up 16.2% of the total etf turnover. gold is seen as a hedge against a global economic meltdown, and the etf allows singaporean investors to participate in the gold bullion market without actually possessing one. from a global view, the wisdom tree europe hedged equity fund was the hottest etf last year, with the most net inflows at us$13.9 billion, according to a bloomberg news report. the fund aims to provide investors with exposure to european equities while neutralising exposure to fluctuations between the euro and us dollar. this was followed by vanguard s&p 500 etf and deutsche x-trackers msci eafe, which saw a net inflow of us$13 billion and us$12.6 billion respectively. the former tracks the overall us stock returns while the latter tracks an index of developed market equities, excluding the us and canada, and hedges the euro and yen against the us dollar. more importantly, mahdzir says the buying and selling of etf shares can be done simply by calling a broker to acquire them on the stock market as etfs are traded like shares despite having a unit trust structure. it also means investors can make an independent decision based on the current situation of the market and make a trade straightaway through a broker. the information is at your fingertips in the internet era. so, if you read an analysis or article on the european economy and you decide to ride the european recovery theme in the current market, you can buy into an etf that tracks the european market, he says. there are currently eight etfs listed on bursa malaysia (see table), four of which provide access to asean and asian markets  the cimb ftse asean 40 malaysia, cimb ftse china 50, myetf msci south east asia islamic dividend and myetf thomson reuters asia pacific ex-japan islamic agribusiness. to buy into etfs in other regions, one has to do so via the singapore exchange.  trading during market volatility aminvest ceo datin maznah mahbob says etfs are an ideal vehicle for individuals who adopt a top-down investment approach to take advantage of market volatility. institutional fund managers like us may have a different investment style. we could have a stock picking style or an asset allocation style between sectors or asset classes. lets say a retail investor with a macroeconomic background adopts the latter approach and avoids stock picking or looking at individual companies, he could utilise etfs to actualise his views, she points out. aminvest was the first to launch a bond and equities etf locally in 2005 and 2007 respectively. maznah says the individual investor would have to understand macroeconomic issues such as liquidity flows, currency movements and impact, and market volatility. this compares with a bottom-up stock picker who looks at a companys fundamentals such as its earnings and balance sheet. when there is market volatility, an investor like this could use it to his advantage and trade in etfs to make a return. technical analysis is one of the methods that can be used when trading in etfs in a volatile market. maznah says technical analysis was very popular in malaysia in the early 1980s and is now widely used by investors in the us. unlike fundamental investors who look at economic and company data and invest for the long haul regardless of market volatility, technical analysts evaluate stocks and securities by analysing statistics generated by market activity such as past prices and volume. they do not measure securities based on intrinsic value, but use charts and other tools, such as indicators, to identify patterns that suggest a stocks future activity. technical analysis looks at price movements and momentum. it uses different tools and indicators to measure whether a security is overbought or oversold. indicators such as head and shoulders, candlestick and the elliot wave [are used to predict the price movement of a security] and to decide when to buy and sell it, says maznah. volatility is expected to be here for a while, and investors worry about it. if you are not a fundamental investor like warren buffett, you either fear it or take advantage of it. applying technical analysis to trading in etfs is one of the ways to exploit market volatility. investors with macroeconomic knowledge but without a technical analysis background can access technical analysis reports to get recommendations. maznah says trading in etfs with technical analysis is an easier investment approach that can be adopted by individual investors. that is because you are trading one security that represents the whole market compared with 20 separate securities. you are looking at one volatility compared with 20. and by adopting technical analysis, the same tools and indicators are applied across all securities to look at the price momentum."}, "85": {"date_posted": "9/2/2016", "title": "cimb in partnership talks for its securities business", "article": " this article first

financial institutions to discuss potential partnerships. some partnership scenarios include the local banking group disposing of some stake in one, or a few, of its securities businesses, says a source familiar with the matter. another source notes that the talks are still preliminary. yes, there are talks, but it is still early days. each party wants to ensure that it is a positive deal for them in the challenging landscape today ... so, it is taking some time, says a banker familiar with the matter. cimb wants a partnership structure that can help it improve its cost-to-income ratio, but at the same time does not involve another round of job cuts. from what we understand, cimb wants to avoid the job-cutting route, if possible, he says. cimb declined to comment when contacted by the edge. cimbs management met with analysts last week and one of the things it guided was that any future rationalisation will focus on its operations outside asean. it is interesting to note that the groups businesses outside asean are mainly in the securities segment. other areas being reviewed would be operations outside asean (the group also has businesses in taiwan, south korea and india) as well as support functions for countries outside asean, which are based in singapore, notes maybank investment bank research in a jan 20 report. cimbs foreign securities business is parked in singapore under cimb securities international, which serves institutional clients in asia-pacific as well as global investors in the regions equity markets. cimb securities international was formerly known as g k goh stockbrokers pte ltd. cimb acquired the foreign stockbroking and investment banking businesses from the g k goh group in 2005. the s$239 million acquisition  its biggest foreign acquisition at the time  gave cimb a platform in singapore as well as other overseas markets such as indonesia, hong kong, the uk and the us. in 2012, cimb group acquired most of the asia-pacific cash equities and associated investment banking businesses of the royal bank of scotland (rbs) in a deal valued at over rm800 million. the rbs purchase transformed cimb into an asia-pacific investment banking player, but raised questions as to whether the local banking group had overstretched itself. cimbs earnings have suffered recently and today, it has one of the lowest common equity tier 1 (cet1) ratios in the industry. in a jan 21 research report, maybank ib research says that while the debate rages as to whether cimb, with its fully loaded cet1 ratio of 9.1%, needs to raise capital, management maintains that the group does not need to do so. it adds that cimb will continue to focus on improving risk weights while expediting non-core asset sales to take its capital ratios up. as at sept 30, 2015, cimb groups total capital ratio stood at 13.4%, while its cet1 capital ratio was 9.3%. in a move to consolidate and manage its ballooning costs, the countrys second largest banking group slashed jobs substantially last year and closed its offices in sydney and melbourne, australia. in its results note for the nine months ended sept 30, 2015, cimb says its business-as-usual cost-to-income ratio improved to 56.2%, from 57.8% a year earlier, as its cost management initiatives begin to show traction. the banking group targets to achieve a cost-to-income ratio of below 50% by end-2018. hong leong investment bank research says that for 2015, cimbs management told analysts that it was keeping to its cost-to-income ratio for 2015 at 55%. for 2016, management hinted that it should not deviate significantly from 2015, as it is looking to contain cost growth of 3% to 4%, it adds in a jan 21 report. last year, cimb cut about 150 jobs outside malaysia and indonesia. it also

the index rose on a rally from a 801.27 low (october 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014), and this represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements after july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,837.28 (low), 1,879.62 (high), 1,766.22 (low), 1,858.09 (high), 1,671.82 (low), 1,810.21 (high), 1,706.18 (low),

1,567, 1,595 and 1,644, while heavy liquidation in the resistance areas of 1,660, 1,696 and 1,727 would cap any index advances. the klcis 18-day and 40-day simple moving averages (smas) depict an emerging downtrend for its short-term daily chart. the indexs price bars are also now below the 50-day and 200-day smas, and this depicts a softer phase for the klci in the medium term. despite the benign tone of the klci, we are recommending a chart buy on public packages holdings bhd (pphb). a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that only one research house covers the stock, with a buy call. pphb is in the packaging business. the company manufactures and retails corrugated cartons, packing materials, offset printed display boxes, gift and display boxes, and paper products. the companys sales revenue and net income have increased steadily over the past three years. its current price-earnings ratio and price-booking ratio stand at extremely low and very attractive levels of

pphbs chart trend in the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly up. its share price has made an obvious surge since its major monthly wave-2 low of 13 sen on july 2009. since that 13 sen low, pphb rose to its recent high of rm1.13 this month. as the share price broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of 90 sen and rm1.04, look to buy pphb on any dips into its support areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term uptrend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) have issued clear buy signals, and now show firm and obvious indications of pphbs eventual surge towards higher levels. it would attract firm buying activities at the support levels of 90 sen, rm1.04 and rm1.06. we expect pphb to witness minor profit-taking at the resistance levels of rm1.13, rm1.23 and rm1.49. its upside targets are located at rm1.21, rm1.40, rm1.89 and rm2.36.  lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist

officer mandy simpson told a press conference on the groups second-quarter results yesterday. the edge financial daily reported in august that datuk sulaiman tahir, the former ceo of cimb group holdings bhds consumer bank, cimb bank bhd, was expected to take up the spot at ambank group once the central bank gave its nod. sulaiman, 52, who had been with cimb group for 25 years, resigned from cimb bank in august and has been on garden leave since. he officially parts ways with the group on nov 22. ambank group has been without a captain ever since its previous group managing director ashok ramamurthy stepped down on april 1 to return to australia to take on a senior executive role at australia and new zealand banking group ltd (anz). anz is the single largest shareholder in ambank group with a 23.78% stake. ambank group then appointed his deputy, datuk mohamed azmi mahmood, as the acting group managing director. meanwhile, ambank group reported a 14.2% drop in second-quarter net

margin compression arising from portfolio-rebalancing initiatives. the wholesale banking divisions net profit was also down 11% y-o-y at rm424.5 million, reflecting pressures on margin, cautious business sentiment and weaker fixed-income trading. during yesterdays event, mohamed azmi said in the near term, business conditions are expected to be challenging against the backdrop of a slowing economy and increasing compliance requirements. the us dollar rise, interest gap, and yuan outlook will continue to weigh on the ringgit, he said. the banking sector is expected to experience slower demand and narrowing net interest margins, while asset quality may come under pressure. private consumption is expected to grow moderately this year. on its part, mohamed azmi said ambank group will remain focused on its fy16 to fy17 strategic agenda to deliver on organic growth, leverage strategic partnerships and acquisitions, and will continue to optimise efficiency and build sustainability.

registration of illegal foreign workers in the country. this service will be an extension of the scope of the service provided by myeg to the immigration department. the news was a positive surprise for us as it should boost foreign workers permit renewal (fwpr) transactions. in may, the government appointed myeg to monitor, build and maintain a database for foreign workers in the country, which the company does via its online fwpr services. there are currently about 2.5 million documented, and four million to five million illegal foreign workers in the country. working together with the authorities, we estimate that myeg would at least register an additional one million undocumented workers over the next few months. we expect the authorities to launch an amnesty programme for undocumented workers soon. in the last 6p amnesty programme in 2013, we believe 1.2 million such workers were legalised and this time, it should be higher at around two million to three million. in our forecasts, we are only assuming a conservative additional one million undocumented workers using the fwpr services. every additional one million fwpr transactions should boost myegs revenue by

now assuming the cstm launch from mid-2016 onwards. the additional fwpr revenue should more than compensate the loss of the cstm revenue as a result of its delayed launch. the share price has been

light rail transit line 3 (lrt3) project. last friday, the joint venture between mrcb and george kent (m) bhd was appointed project delivery partner (pdp) for the rail project, beating five other local contenders. a ta securities analyst told the digitaledge daily that he sees the project enhancing george kent's earnings given its relatively small market capitalisation of rm414.57 million. while analysts are positive on the news, it did little to excite the market. mrcb shares closed down one sen or 1% to close at 99 sen yesterday, with 20.04 million shares traded. it has a market capitalisation of rm1.78 billion. george kent's stock ended the day one sen or 0.72% higher at rm1.40, with 6.19 million shares changing hands. cimb research senior analyst shahrizan rosely estimates that the award would translate into rm19 million to rm25 million of net profit per year for mrcb in fy16 and fy17. this will progressively grow higher towards the projects completion in 2020 (five years). this translates into a potential fy16 and fy17 earnings per share enhancement of 14% to 17% per year and revalued net asset valuation boost of 6%, he said. \"the downside risks to the 6% pdp fees are cost overruns, variation orders and delays. this is the reason that the next tender phase for the seven civil work packages remain crucial,\" shahrizan said in a note to clients yesterday. \"we believe that the other terms of the pdp would be similar to those of the mass rapid transit. the project owner, prasarana malaysia bhd, is targeting for physical works to commence in the second half of 2016, implying faster execution than that for the rm28 billion mrt line 2,\" he noted. hlib research sees mrcb's fy16 and fy17 earnings being enhanced by rm31 million to rm41 million or 26% to 28% with the pdp role in its bag. the research firm has raised its target price (tp) for mrcb to rm1.36 from rm1.19 , with the \"buy\" rating intact. kenanga research believes that being the pdp for lrt3 will enable mrcb to secure more contract flows from lrt3 in the near to mid term, which will further boost its existing order book of rm1.7 billion. \"additionally, the pdp role will easily add rm54 million per year to the groups bottom line, assuming a clean 6% pdp fee from prasarana,\" it said. kenanga research is upgrading mrcb to \"market perform\" post its appointment as pdp for lrt3 with a higher tp of rm1.10 from 81 sen previously. \"we believe the pdp role for lrt3 will raise its earnings profile in the medium term and may also see potential contract news flow from lrt3.

announcing sulaimans resignation on aug 21. he said the group has already started the process of identifying the next ceo for cimb bank. for the interim period, it appointed chief financial officer shahnaz jamal as the person in charge of the bank. meanwhile, the upcoming new leadership at ammb comes as the group is going through one of its most challenging times. competition and capital requirements are getting increasingly tough even as the economy slows, making it harder for a mid-sized domestic-focused bank like ammb to grow earnings at the pace it used to. ammb needs a clearer focus. sulaiman, if appointed, needs to galvanise the troops and come up with a clearer direction for it. he needs to improve its market shares, remarks a banking analyst. it didnt help ammb when the wall street journal reported early last month alleged transfers of up to us$700 million from entities linked to embattled state-owned 1malaysia development bhd to prime minister datuk seri najib razaks personal bank accounts in the ammb group. (najib says the funds were not for personal gain, while the malaysian anti-corruption commission has said that the rm2.6 billion deposited into his accounts were from middle eastern donors whose identities it could not disclose.) ammbs management, in mid-july, held a conference call with analysts to assure them and investors that it had sound corporate governance and strong internal controls in place to ensure compliance to rules. ammb started off its current financial year ending march 31, 2016 (fy2016) on a relatively weak note. its underlying net profit for the first quarter  up by just 3% to rm340 million (excluding one-off divestment gains in the first quarter a year ago)  came in below analysts expectations. net lending fell by 1.8%. analysts were particularly concerned about the significant dip in its margins. its net interest margin (nim), the difference between the interest it pays on deposits and what it earns from loans, fell by 33 basis points (bps) to 2.11% for the first quarter ended june 30 from the same quarter a year ago, and by 21bps from the previous quarter. the squeeze in nim has been more severe than expected, banking analyst julian chua of nomura research says in an aug 19 report following the release of ammbs first quarter results. he had expected a 15bps drop in nim on a year-on-year basis  not 33. the drop is partly due to its ongoing moves to reduce its exposure in the risky but high-yielding automotive loan segment, in which it is a major player. the nim decline is part of a trend which began in early 2014 when management decided to reduce the low-income household exposure in the auto loan segment. auto finance, which used to account for 31% of total loans in fy2013, now makes up 26%. this de-risking of the portfolio has had a knock-on effect on group margins, says chua. compounding this is the fact that ammb has been reducing the duration of the fixed income securities it holds to shorter-tenure but lower-yielding ones, in anticipation of volatility in the fixed income market. from a margins perspective, the decline in ammbs nim has been much more dramatic than its peers, observes another banking analyst. ammb guided for a 15bps to 20bps compression in nim for the full year. the relatively weak first quarter results prompted a slew of earnings cuts and target price downgrades from analysts, although most still maintained their hold calls on the stock. bloomberg data shows that of 24 analysts that track the stock, 16 had a hold call, while its 12-month target price was rm5.40. it closed at rm4.67 on aug 21.  this article first appeared in digitaledgeweekly, on august 24 - 30, 2015."}, "109": {"date_posted": "7/9/2015", "title": "moodys says cimb thais thb3.7b rights issue 'credit positive'", "article": " kuala lumpur (sept 7): cimb thai bank pcls rights issue to raise thb3.7 billion (about rm443 million ) is deemed 'credit positive' for the group, according to bond rating agency moodys investors service. in a note today, moody's said the rights issue, which was scheduled to take place this october, would increase cimb thai's common equity tier 1 (cet 1) ratio to 10.7%, from 9.1%. moody's said the exercise would place cimb thai closer to thailand's banking sector average cet 1 ratio of 13.1%. \"the capital raise is credit positive for cimb thai, because it will strengthen its loss-absorption buffer to withstand slower economic growth, rising asset quality pressures and elevated credit costs affecting thai banks. \"compared with other thai banks [that] we rate, cimb thai has weaker loss-absorption capacity, owing to its weaker capitalization and poorer asset quality. cimb thais gross nonperforming loans ratio deteriorated to 4.1% as of 30 june 2015, from 3.3% at year-end 2014, exceeding the thai banking systems average of 2.4% at 30 june 2015,\" moody's said. malaysia-based cimb group holdings bhd via cimb bank bhd, owns 93.7% of cimb thai. moodys said the capital injection from cimb bank to cimb thai was expected to lower cimb bank's cet 1 ratio by some 10 basis points. \"however, this will not impact the consolidated capital ratio of the banking group. as at june 30, cimb group holdings bhd['s] total capital ratio stood at 13.9%, while its cet 1 capital ratio was at 9.7%,\" moody's said. at 12:30pm, cimb group's shares fell four sen or 0.8% to settle at rm4.71, for a market capitalisation of rm39.99 billion. the stock saw some three million shares done.

ii) heveaboard is seeing increasing e0 particle board (pb) orders from existing markets like south korea and india; iii) it also expects an increase in pb/furniture demand from japan in fy16, due to scarce raw material supply for its japanese competitors, aggressive inventory restocking by customers prior to the sales tax increase in 2017 and pre-2020 olympics spending;

about 77% of its land bank is in this region. last thursday, uem sunrise chief executive officer anwar syahrin abdul ajib said the group is looking to widen its earnings base and shift away from its stronghold iskandar malaysia, as a measure to counter the supply glut of residential property. we see diversification of land bank as important because 77% of our land is in johor. we still believe in the [iskandar] story and [the] property [sector] there is big. but there is a downturn now and we just have to weather the storm. in particular, uem sunrise is looking to purchase land in the klang valley, penang, sabah and sarawak with the rm500 million per year landbanking budget it has. anwar added that from this point onwards, the group will be very careful about building in nusajaya, and will focus only on product offerings which cater to buyers needs. analysts believe the groups plan to look for other sources of earnings is its first step in the right direction, although its near-term impact may not be immediately visible. on the other hand, tan siang hin, an analyst at public investment bank bhd, believes that uem sunrises land still has upside potential in the long term due to its low average price per sq ft at less than rm15. if im an investor, i would look at the assets that the company has. just do some reverse engineering: market cap over land bank. what we would get is that the cost of [uem sunrises] land is less than rm15 per sq ft, which i think is very cheap, he commented. he has a contrarian buy call on the stock. tan compared uem sunrises land bank price (of less than rm15 per sq ft) to other plantation land in johor which goes for between rm20 and rm30 per sq ft.

garvin jabusch, co-founder and chief investment officer at green alpha advisors, certainly believes so. we have every opportunity to obtain competitive returns from investing in green assets. the most important innovations in the world have made the economy more efficient. this means more economic output. this generates wealth, he says. companies at the forefront of innovation will be the most sustainable and profitable in the long run, adds jabusch, who manages us$37 million at the denver-based asset management firm in the us.\nwhat green means there are a number ways to define a green stock. in the sustainable investment space, terms such as environmental, social and corporate governance (esg), socially responsible investing (sri), and green investing are often used interchangeably. this makes the evaluation of sustainable investments highly subjective, and thus unreliable for comparison. even within the different funds, investments are made based on varying criteria, according to jabusch. what you have here is quite an array of definitions. there are no two [asset management] institutions that view this in the exact same way. so, it is up to the individual manager running the mutual fund or portfolio to define what green means for themselves and their clients, he says. to provide greater clarity, green alpha advisors created the green alpha next economy index (nextx), which tracks the performance of companies in what it calls the next economy  companies that are green, self-sustaining, eco-efficient and fossil fuel-free. the nextx benchmarks itself against the s&p 500 and the powershares wilderhill clean energy index, and has returned 99.36% compared with the s&p 500s 163.1% and the powershares wilderhill clean energy indexs -30.35% between december 2008 and december 2014. tesla motors inc, sunedison inc, american water works company inc and applied materials inc are among the constituents of nextx. investors themselves may have their own definitions or requirements from the type of green investments they buy into. datuk shireen muhiudeen, managing director and principal fund manager at corston-smith asset management sdn bhd, says what clients ask for in their investment mandates can vary. for example, you can have clients who say they dont want to buy anything that deals with nuclear power, but they are okay with fishing companies that use trawl nets to catch fish. it is up to the client to decide its threshold of what green is and is not, she says, adding that this requires the client to do his or her own homework. they first have to look into the earnings contribution of a company and see what proportion of its revenue is from green sources. then, they have to decide whether this is acceptable, says shireen, whose firm manages private investment mandates for institutional clients. for jabusch, his definition of what is green is pretty straightforward. when you look at the environmental, social and governance definition, we are more focused on the e part rather than the s and g, he says. we try to assemble a portfolio of companies that operate in businesses we hope can contribute to an economy that is indefinitely sustainable, or can go on for a long time without running into systemic risks that could undermine our environment over the long run.  this article first appeared inpersonal wealth, a section ofthe edge malaysia, on march 23 - 29, 2015.

redberry media group, the media business unit of agricultural chemicals producer ancom bhd (fundamental: 0.55; valuation: 1.20), is in talks to sell its airport advertising business at around rm100 million. potential buyers, say industry sources, include media prima bhd (fundamental: 1.80; valuation: 1.20), whose subsidiary big tree is the biggest outdoor advertising company in the country and will be keen to extend its reach into airports. another party will be star publications (m) bhd (fundamental: 2.70; valuation: 1.20), which wants to diversify its revenue stream from mainly the print segment. redberry, which is also involved in the outdoor/billboard and in-store advertising business, conducts its airport advertising operation via meru utama sdn bhd. redberry and star have been in [informal] talks, says a source. according to the financial report for its nine months ended sept 30, 2014, star was sitting pretty on rm354.3 million net cash. the group does have money to buy assets but the acquisitions have to make sense and be a good fit for it. diversification is key to it and it also seems keen on digital assets, says a local media analyst. should redberry sell meru utama, its planned listing will not take place this year as the bulk of the formers revenue and profit is from the 75%-owned unit. according to its audited accounts for fy2013 ended may 31, meru utama registered a net profit of rm5.68 million  slightly lower than its rm5.87 million earnings a year earlier. a price tag of rm100 million values meru utama at a price-earnings ratio of nearly 20 times. on its website, it says it has been a strategic business partner of malaysia airports holdings bhd (mahb) in promoting and developing advertising at airports for the past 29 years. the edge, quoting sources, wrote in november last year that redberry was eyeing the listing of its media business on the local bourse as early as this year. it said what could be included in the listing were media properties under ancoms wholly-owned subsidiary redberry sdn bhd and the privately held the malay mail group. the malay mail group or its operating entity malay mail sdn bhd is currently not a part of ancom. its connection to the group is through ancom group managing director datuk siew kah wei and non-executive, non-independent director tan sri al amin abdul majid. both have a stake in malay mail through their respective 50% equity interest in dahlia megah sdn bhd, which, in turn, has a 46.79% stake in malay mail. in a reply to a bursa query on the edges november story, ancom says it is constantly on the lookout for opportunities to expand the groups media business locally and regionally through mergers and acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures and business collaborations, with the ultimate objective of listing redberry. why would star be interested? it is no secret that the print industry has been disrupted by digital technology and media players like star that are traditionally strong in print are racing against the clock to diversify to strengthen their position. according to the latest data by the audit bureau of circulations malaysia, total newspaper circulation volume in 1h2014 fell 10.9% year on year in the english and vernacular segments. in the english segment, circulation dropped 9.7% y-o-y to 767,891 copies from january to june 2014. cimb research, in a jan 26 note, says the drop can be attributed to a normalising effect following the general election in 2013, a structural shift towards the digital platform and a persistent weakness in consumer sentiment. despite the ongoing decline in print circulation, star managed to buck the trend and recorded 0.6% and 0.3% y-o-y growth for the star and sunday star respectively. we believe this is mainly due to its strong position as the market leader in the english segment and higher share of adex. star also continues to dominate the digital paper segment with a strong leading position of over 80,000 daily circulation compared with 3,000 for the new straits times press, it says.overall, we expect the declining trend in print circulation to continue due to rising consumer exposure to online and digital platforms. star has been aggressively diversifying into the digital space. in 2012, it launched star epaper. the group notes that circulation for its digital edition saw a 535% jump to 49,006 copies for the six months ended june 30, 2013, from a year earlier. then in 2013, it expanded its digital footprint through the acquisition of ocision sdn bhd, which owned three internet portals  ibilik.com, propwall.com and carsifu.com. in 9mfy2014, star saw its net profit decline 8.8% to rm89.93 million due to higher operating expenses related mainly to a vss amounting to rm11.5 million. revenue for the period declined 0.4% to rm732.85 million. maybank investment research says it expects stars 4qfy2014 core net profit to be flattish at about rm35 million quarter on quarter. this will bring 4qfy2014 core net profit down between 20% and 25% y-o-y. for the whole of 2014, we expect core net profit to come within expectations at about rm135 million or down between 5% and 6% y-o-y, it notes. it adds that while it does not expect organic earnings growth to be exciting in the near future, it still likes star for its cost-saving initiatives and operational turnaround. its

since october last year, and the stock currently is trading at a price-to-book (p/b) valuation of 1.2 to 1.3 times, which is one of the lowest in the sector. yet, fund managers and banking analysts say it may not be the right time to get into the counter as the countrys second largest banking group still needs to deliver on its targets and digest its acquisitions of the last few years.  investors who have been eyeing cimb will notice that its shares have been trading at historically low levels in the past few years. in fact, the stock hit a low of rm5.17 last month  its lowest since october 2009. it has since rebounded to close at rm5.69 last friday. even so, it has yet to recover to its average levels seen last year and in 2013 of rm6 and rm7 respectively.  there are a number of reasons why the stock has been battered of late, and these include disappointing results  cimb has seen year-on-year decline in earnings for the last six quarters since the quarter ended june 30, 2013  and the expectation that its results will continue to be weak for at least the following two quarters. on top of that, there is also the uncertainty surrounding the banking group following recent management changes. management has disclosed its ambitious t18 strategy, but we need to see strong execution. for example, it closed its australian business, which demonstrates that it is willing to take some heavy cuts to restore investor confidence. but what would reaffirm conviction for the stock is for the bank to stop acquiring more assets, and consolidating whatever it has in its balance sheet. the healing process will definitely take time, says bharat joshi, head of investments at pt aberdeen asset management, tells the edge in a telephone interview from jakarta. the franchise is certainly cheap at this level, but it still needs to trim a lot of the fat accumulated over the past decade. the consumer bank engine needs to be reignited while tightening up the cimb niaga business because its starting to become the achilles heel for the bank. the non-performing loans (npls) are coming back to bite them. cimb niagas net profit for its financial year ended dec 31, 2014, fell 45.3% y-o-y to idr2.3 trillion (rm646.47 million) on the back of a 188% y-o-y increase in provisions to idr3.5 trillion. consolidated gross npl ratio surged to 3.9% by the end of last year from 2.23% in 2013. we are still holding on to cimb shares but wont be adding more until we see actual results. we are in it for the long term, but we want to see its execution ability before we start turning optimistic again, says bharat. banking analysts share his views. the stock has come a long way u2026 but there will still be bad news to come. there will be fourth-quarter results that are expected to be very weak, says a senior banking analyst. moreover, a lot of people are still wondering if it can successfully execute what it plans to do. so far, they have missed their targets. most investors will want to wait to see how the restructuring and cost-cutting pan out first. also, cimbs regional side needs to be cleaned up. the asset quality problems in indonesia are not that great. investors should get a better sense of the amount of provisions they have to make and when the npls will peak in indonesia before buying into the regional exposure. six analysts polled by bloomberg have a buy call on the stock, while another six have a sell call. a majority of the analysts polled  14  have a hold recommendation. the 12-month consensus target price for cimb is rm6.02. another banking analyst reckons that investors who are patient and willing to ride out the near-term headwinds that cimb will be facing could consider picking the stock should it continue to trade at the current low levels. it also depends on the investors risk appetite, he says. uob kay hian research says it believes that the rm5.20 level (1.1 times its forecast fy2015 book value) represents a more attractive entry point as the current 1.2 times p/b may not have fully priced in two quarters (4qfy2014 and 1qfy2015) of weak results, which could drag the groups return on equity (roe) to 10% versus the current 11.5% expectation. with cimb expected to report further weakness in 4qfy2014 and 1qfy2015 earnings, coupled with a rather subdued growth outlook guidance for 2015, we see downside risk in earnings expectations and hence, roe as well. note that 3qfy2014 roe of 9.8% was significantly lower than managements initial 2014 target of 13.5%, it adds. the foreign research house has a hold call on the stock and a target price of rm6 (1.3 times 2015f p/b and 11.3% roe). banking on alternatives if one falls into the category of wait-and-see investors and does not want to buy into cimb just yet, what are the alternatives out there? public bank bhd (fundamental: 2.8; valuation: 1.0) has always been a favourite in the finance sector given its earnings track record, but it does not come cheap, trading at a high premium of 2.55 times p/b  the highest in the sector. as most banks are battling in a tougher operating landscape, the third largest banking group in the country recently announced another strong set of results. for its fy2014 ended dec 31, 2014, public bank posted an 11.17% increase in net profit to rm4.52 billion compared with a year ago. commenting on the fy2014 financial results over a week ago, founder and chairman tan sri teh hong piow said the group persevered and continued to perform well, recording a strong annual loan growth of 10.8%, outpacing the banking systems 8.7%. public bank is expensive. but if investors are willing to pay the premium for its earnings predictability, it is a good choice, says another banking analyst. but there are others like hong leong bank bhd (fundamental: 2.8; valuation: 2.2) and rhb capital bhd (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 2.1) which may provide a cheaper entry [into the sector] and still bring steady earnings. but bear in mind that they will not be able to give them the regional reach that cimb can. rhb capital is trading at 1.14 times p/b and hong leong, 1.7 times. the two domestic banks  hong leong bank and public bank  which didnt jump on the regional acquisition bandwagon have remained quite sturdy. i wouldnt say going regional is a bad thing, but one always has to be careful, especially in newer markets where one lacks local knowledge or experience. there has to be a gradual and sustainable expansion strategy in any market one goes into, says bharat. industry observers also point out that malayan banking bhd (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 1.3) will be able to provide the regional reach investors are looking for. it is trading at 1.68 times p/b. maybank is an option, but it is comparatively not as cheap as cimb now. i guess there is a price for everything, says a local banking analyst with a bank-backed research house.   note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a

the index still did not manage to overcome the long 200-day moving average and the immediate resistance level at 1,830 points. this indicates that the market is being cautious and this is expected before the long weekend holiday starts. the momentum of the bullish trend is weak as momentum indicators were unable to climb higher. the macd indicator has just crossed slightly below its moving average and the rsi indicator is forming a bearish divergence. furthermore, the bollinger bands are starting to contract despite the index staying above its middle band. despite the coming holidays, the market still managed to remains firm and this indicates strong market confidence. if there are no negative catalysts in the global markets and economy, we may see the index trend higher after the holidays. nevertheless, the index has to break above the immediate resistance level at 1,830 points to boost market confidence and for the bullish trend to continue. the trend is expected to remain bullish as long as the index stays above the immediate support level at 1,780 points.  i would like to take the opportunity to wish gong xi fa cai to all those who are celebrating the chinese new year

one of the topics that have emerged from the collapsed talks is the possibility of another suitor for rhb (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 2.1). it is no secret that the largest bank in the country, malayan banking bhd (maybank), also had its eye on rhb last year but was beaten to the punch by cimb (fundamental: 1.35; valuation: 2.1). back in 2011, both maybank and cimb had simultaneously pursued rhb. but they walked away after rhbs middle eastern shareholder abu dhabi commercial bank (adcb) sold its stake to a sister company at a hefty price, setting the valuation bar too high for a merger deal to happen. with negotiations for the tripartite merger called off now, speculation is rife that maybank may seize the opportunity to make a move on rhb. a senior maybanker acknowledges that in the banks scenario planning of potential acquisitions of local lenders, rhb has emerged as the top choice. however, he and other bankers point out that maybank is not likely to make a move immediately. when we looked at the scenarios u2026 rhb was the preferred choice. but you have to take into account why the mega merger with cimb was called off. the reasons for it being called off (see accompanying story) are valid concerns and the same concerns would be applicable to us, so we have to think hard about this, says the senior banker. another senior maybanker points out that the bank and rhb have too many overlapping businesses and functions. in a merger, there would have to be staff redundancies, things like vss (voluntary separation schemes), which employees are unlikely to want to take up in the current economic climate. so, it really makes more sense for maybank to seek opportunities to fill business gaps instead. if there was a good thai bank or indonesian insurance company, those would make more sense for maybank to acquire. industry observers also note that any acquirer of rhb would likely have to include mbsb (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 2.4) in the mix. this is because the employees provident fund (epf), the major shareholder of both rhb (41.5%) and mbsb (64.6%), is likely to want a bundled deal akin to the one that had been threshed out with cimb. still, it is no surprise that rhb has caught the interest of potential suitors. it has been one of the best performing local banks in terms of earnings recently. despite the tougher operating environment, rhb saw its net profit rise 16.5% to rm1.55 billion on the back of slightly higher revenue of rm7.58 billion in the nine months ended sept 30, 2014. annualised return on equity (roe) stood at 11.8%.  in contrast, cimbs nine-month net profit fell 17% to rm2.91 billion on the back of slightly lower revenue of rm10.47 billion, mainly because of its exposure to asset quality and profitability pressures in indonesia through bank cimb niaga. the indonesian operation used to account for about a third of cimbs profits. cimbs annualised net roe was 11.6%. meanwhile, there is speculation that japans sumitomo mitsui banking corp may also be keen on rhb. sumitomo ceased to be a substantial shareholder in rhb in march 2002 when it disposed of a 3.84% stake. in 2007, there was talk that the japanese lender had applied to bank negara malaysia for approval to start talks with the epf for a stake of up to 15% in rhb. but the acquisition never happened. instead, rhb saw the entry of adcb as its foreign shareholder. sumitomo, however, continues to have a good working relationship with rhb. it still maintains a japan desk in rhb, although it obtained its own banking licence in malaysia in 2011. there is market talk that the japanese bank could be keen to upgrade that working relationship to a shareholding partnership, says an industry observer. however, when asked about the possible emergence of a new suitor, a source close to the major shareholders of rhb says there is no conversation right now on any takeover. with the merger talks off, the group can get back to focusing on its business. merger talks can be distracting to all parties involved, he says. rhb group managing director kellee kam, in an internal memo to staff last week, said the group would now refocus its energy on accelerating its three-year transformation plan. the plan, known as ignite 2017, includes targets to boost revenue from overseas and accelerate islamic banking growth. is cimbs heyday over? industry observers say cimb must go back to the drawing board and come up with a concrete solution to improve its dismal earnings and cut costs. the countrys second largest banking group has seen year-on-year earnings drop for the last six quarters since the quarter ended june 30, 2013. costs went up substantially after it bought most of the royal bank of scotlands (rbs) investment banking businesses in asia-pacific in 2012, in a move to become a larger regional player, analysts say. perhaps the failed merger talks are a blessing in disguise. cimb still has to digest its rbs acquisition and its indonesian business is not doing well u2026 and given the current environment, it could be a bad idea for them to be undertaking an acquisition of that size, says a banking analyst. cimb acting group ceo tengku datuk zafrul aziz, in an internal memo to staff last week, said while the group was disappointed thatthe merger would not be realised, it would move on with its own plans as it had not pinned all its hopes on the merger. in fact, we have been working very hard behind the scenes on our new mid-term strategy and road map to 2018 since we announced the strategic review last year. now that the merger is no longer proceeding, we are ready to start implementing our strategic plans, he said, adding that the strategy would involve key focus areas such as culture, productivity, transaction banking, islamic banking and small and medium enterprises. zafrul took over the hot seat from datuk seri nazir razak last september. nazir moved on to become group chairman. mbsb works to become a bank non-bank lender mbsb is understood to be working on a five-year business plan. the tougher economic situation doesnt allow the group to explore mergers and acquisitions right now u2026 but perhaps in the next one or two years, or when things improve, it might look for another suitor, a source tells the edge. for now, it is continuing with its efforts to become a full-fledged bank. once it has moved more towards a banking platform, its options are better for getting a banking licence and doing m&a. its almost there on most counts when it comes to closing the gap to becoming a full-fledged islamic financial institution, the source adds.  note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines whether a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers. a score of 3 suggests strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. go to www.theedgemarkets.com for more details on a companys financial dashboard)  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on january 19 - 25 , 2015.

consensus fy14f eps of u00a30.26 per share. at a premium of 30% to 50% over the current price (u00a35.40 to u00a36.30 per share), nbpol would be valued at 21 times and 24 times its fy14f eps  which is on the steep side. this would have translated into a purchase price of rm4.3 billion to rm5 billion for sime darby to assume full control of nbpol. nonetheless, we believe the long-term prospects

highest since march 2013. \"exports were good, no doubt, but it was not good enough,\" said a trader with a local commodities brokerage in malaysia. \"we should have done at least 1.65 million tonnes. and production did not fall enough,\" the trader added. overseas sales of palm oil products by the key producer likely hit 1.6 million tonnes last month, the survey showed, up 11.3 percent from a month ago as buyers from india, china and europe snapped up shipments after malaysia scrapped taxes on crude palm oil exports for september and october. indonesia also removed its tax on crude palm oil exports for october in response to the malaysian duty structure. cargo surveyor data show that malaysian palm oil exports were 16-17 percent higher in september from august, with demand for crude

(1qfy14) was down a sharp 56% year-on-year (y-o-y) at rm1.5 million although revenue was up 1.8% y-o-y. the lower profit was mainly due to the increase in raw material prices and higher electricity costs since the start of the year. however, interim dividend per share (dps) was two sen, in line with our expectations. net dividend payout ratio was 133% of net profit in 1qfy14. during the quarter, the company was hit by the rise in raw material prices and electricity tariffs. raw materials make up more than 60% of production costs. prices for some of its raw materials like polypropylene and polypropylene films rose 5% to 10% in the quarter. tomypak had no choice but to absorb part of the higher costs. as selling prices to its multinational corporation customers (50% to 60% of its revenue) are renewed quarterly, we believe its 2qfy14 profit margin should see some signs of recovery if raw material prices stabilise in the current quarter. at the start of this year, electricity

almost double its market capitalisation to rm1.5 billion by 2017, as it continues to grow its recurring revenue businesses and opens more training schools to provide skills and up-skilling training in the oil and gas (o&g) industry. the groups market capitalisation had grown from rm198 million since its listing in july 2011 to rm858 million as at may 23, underlining a 450% increase in its share price since then. prestariangs share price has risen 35.42% year-to-date, to close down one sen or 0.51% at rm1.95 last friday. prestariang chief executive officer datuk abu hasan ismail said the group had in fact met the first target set to reach a market capitalisation of rm500 million within three years of its listing. our theme for this year is to grow our recurring revenue businesses for sustainability. we aim to continue with our asset-light, cash-rich model and being a dividend yield stock, he said in an interview with the edge financial daily. the information and communication technology (ict) service provider will also look to the o&g industry for continued growth opportunities. it makes business sense for us to venture into the o&g industry which is really hot right now. the industry needs trained employees and we bring something different in the sense that those who graduate from our training academy will receive certification, which will then allow them to progress in their careers, said abu hasan. prestariang sees the o&g industry eventually overtaking the ict sector to become the groups major contributor to its core business of training. the [ict] segment would eventually contribute a smaller percentage to the groups earnings as prestariang looks towards o&g and possibly other sectors to expand into, said abu hasan. this doesnt mean that we are moving away from the ict business. rather, we hope that in time the o&g industry will also become a part of our core business, he added. the next phase for the groups ict business would be to move into security, cloud computing and big data analytics. last year, prestariang ventured into the o&g sector by setting up a training school in kuala selangor to train, upskill and reskill graduates and professionals. the academy, known as petroleum academy malaysia, has since been closed and relocated to johor and will start operations next month with an initial intake of 100 students for upskilling courses. the academy can house a maximum of 500 students. the academy is a 70:30 joint venture between prestariangs wholly-owned subsidiary, prestariang technology sdn bhd and ypj holdings sdn bhd, an investment arm of the johor education foundation. when we approached them (the johor government), they were more than happy because they did not have any partnership or a plan to train the skill set needed for pengerang, abu hasan recalled. it was reported that the pengerang integrated petroleum complex will require some 70,000 skilled employees. abu hasan said prestariang plans to open another o&g training school in sarawak by the end of this year, but did not elaborate. as for the groups venture into the education business with its university malaysia of computer science & engineering (unimy), providing specialised computer science and engineering education, abu hasan expects the institution to break even by the end of the year.  abu hasan: we hope that in time the o&g industry will also become a part of our core business. the unimy campus only has 51 students currently, despite being able to accommodate 3,000 students annually. in a note dated feb 21, cimb research said

the construction sector to grow at a slower pace than the consensus forecast of 10% this year, it said. the weekly said infrastructure projects accounted for 20.4% of new construction contracts in 2013, down from an average of 31.4% from 2007 to 2013. looking ahead, no tenders will be awarded for the massive rm25 billion second klang valley mass rapid transit line soon, although the cabinet approved the project last month, it added. the weekly noted that project manager mrt corp has said tenders for the rail project will only be called next year after the public display, environmental impact assessment, land acquisitions and fine-tuning of the alignment have been completed. it is highly unlikely that a project this size and with high multiplier value will be scrapped, but a lengthy delay could be costly. players like gamuda bhd and mmc corp bhd have invested heavily in 10 tunnel-boring machines for line one. the equipment makes the mmc-gamuda partnership a strong contender for the next tunnelling package, but it could mean expensive holding costs if there is no timely deployment of the machines, say industry observers. following the governments cooling measures, the residential property market is expected to see a slowdown. and given that 30% of new contracts came from residential projects last year, any weakening will have a substantial impact on the sector. the weekly also quoted rhb research institutes chief economist lim chee sing as saying that potential homebuyers were also facing hurdles in securing bank financing with loan rejection rates potentially as high as 30% based on recent reports. as a result, there could be a delay in the rolling- out of several mega property developments planned in the klang valley because these are highly dependent on market demand to get off the ground, it said. the rm50 billion development by the epfs wholly-owned kwasa land sdn bhd on the rubber research institute of malaysias (rrim) 2,330 acres in the heart of the klang valley could be the largest to be affected, noted the weekly. however, despite the slowdown in the near term, longer-term support for the industry remains intact, said the weekly. looking ahead, the fundamental drivers remain supportive of the construction sector amid continued fiscal consolidation. progress in existing projects in the transport, utility, highway, power plant and oil and gas sectors as well as housing development projects should ensure the sector expands at a healthy pace, it quoted cimb researchs chief economist lee heng guie as saying. the weekly in its analysis pointed out that the kl construction index had climbed 20% in the past 12 months after construction stocks found with investors again following the general election in may last year. it said the rise was much higher than the fbm klcis gain of 9% over the same period, indicating strong interest in the sector amid expectation of a steady stream of contracts, which would boost their order books. so, will the rally go on? asked the weekly. despite several analysts expressing bullish views on the sector, the weekly explained that not all was rosy for construction stocks when one looked beyond the long list of construction jobs in the pipeline. as the rally in property and oil and gas stocks appears to have lost steam this year, some say investors may turn to the construction sector because of its attractive fundamentals, it said. for more details on the construction and property sector outlook, read the edge weekly (may 5 u2013 may 11 issue)."}, "145": {"date_posted": "6/5/2014", "title":

has raised the spectre of a slowdown in construction contract flow and a cooling property market that may have an adverse impact on shares of these companies and questions if it was time for investors to take their money off the table. the edge weekly in its cover story said that the rm200 billion worth of jobs in the pipeline for the next 20 years had been carrots for investors and driven up valuations. however, as the government nears the end of its fiscal rope and the property market slows down, investors will have to reassess the potential risk of delays in these mega projects, it said. it said that although the short and mid-term fundamentals of most of the construction players are still intact and they have sizeable order books to keep them busy until the end of next year, the problem is that many of the mega-projects in the pipeline would not be awarded anytime soon. citing gadang holdings bhd major shareholder and managing director tan sri kok onn, the edge said that the only major projects that will go ahead this year were those of petronas in the form of rapid and rapid phase 2. it said the rm60 billion rapid (refinery and petrochemical integrated development)

singapore jumped 3.4 percent to an intra-day high of s$1.36, its highest since april 25, after the casino operator said on monday its core earnings for the quarter ended march 31 soared 60 percent on the year as gaming income recorded robust gains. cimb maintained its \"add\" rating on the stock and target price of s$1.81, citing growth in vip revenue and market share gain as potential catalysts for further growth. it also cited a planned new casino in south korea. \"when it opens in the first quarter of 2017, it will be well positioned to tap into the north china market which we estimate will be the same size as asean's $10 billion gross gaming revenue,\" cimb said. gains in genting were offset by losses in singapore press holdings ltd and golden agri-resources ltd, which led declines

rm7.35)maintain add with target price of rm7.75: we maintain our add rating on cimb group at an unchanged target price of rm7.75, based on a financial year 2015 ending dec 31 (fy15e) return on equity of 13.6%, cost of equity of 11.2% and a growth rate of 7%, which translates into a price-to-book value (p/bv) multiple of 1.56 times.  with the recent run-up in cimbs share price, upside remains fairly minimal at 4.5%, and the stock is currently trading at a slightly higher p/bv multiple of 1.6 times fy14e and 1.5 times fy15e (from its recent low of 1.5 times fy14e).  we believe that investors should hold on to the stock. in our view, the stabilising regional outlook, driven by lower volatility and currency risks, coupled with managements mitigative measures to stem net interest margin (nim) compression, will be cimbs key earnings drivers for fy14 to fy16 and sustain the share price.  although this appears largely to have been priced in (as per our valuation, which is based on fy15e earnings), we continue to be positive on cimbs outlook and will look for potential surprises such as: (i) a recovery in mark-to-market losses and higher trade volumes to underpin non-interest income growth; (ii) a sharper improvement in the cost-to-income ratio from our current forecast of 56% for fy14; and (iii) a pick up in deal flow, driven by the royal bank of scotlands (rbs) investment bank platform and network. although management remains cautious on its indonesian operations (30% of profit before tax [pbt]) banking outlook, it believes its domestic operations will continue to sustain group earnings and remain the key driver (at about 60% of group pbt).  according to management, approval rates for new mortgages in malaysia are still on an uptrend, but the growth rate is tapering off as cimb has shifted its strategy to target the preferred and prime customer segments rather than the mass market. cimb is targeting a larger share of the consumer and corporate wallet through cross-selling, instead of getting the highest pricing for loan products.  overall, management has guided for malaysia/singapore loans to grow at 11% to 12% per annum, while indonesia has reiterated its growth target of about 13% to 14% per annum.  meanwhile, the other overseas unit rbs (which was acquired in april 2012), still has not contributed meaningfully to the group due to slower deal flow, although the pipeline remains robust. in our view, nims in the banking industry are facing a new norm as new loans are being priced lower due to stiff industry competition (prevailing low interest rates are another dampener). overall, management is guiding for a decline of five basis points (bps) to 15bps in fy14 group nim.  management has guided for a more stable 1qfy14 nim outlook for malaysia, singapore and thailand, while funding cost pressure in indonesia should continue to pressure the overall group nim. key risks to our view include: (i) a more drastic nim compression than our fy14 forecast of 2.82%; (ii) lower loan growth versus our conservative forecast of 10% per annum for fy14 to fy16; and (iii) a higher requirement for capital buffers, hence raising cost of funds.  affin investment bank, may 5 this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on may 6, 2014."}, "148": {"date_posted": "9/4/2014", "title": "#highlight* sign of

created by the finance ministry to raise funds for the country's largest infrastructure project, may issue and list on the stock exchange this year as many as two islamic bonds worth 100 million ringgit ($30.4 million) each, an official with the bourse said. \"we are in engagement with them, and definitely we will see at least one or two issuances this year,\" jamaluddin nor mohamad, head of islamic and alternative markets at bursa malaysia, said in an interview. the expected issuance is necessary to promote bursa malaysia as a market for retail sukuk, he said. danainfra is so far the only institution to have issued sukuk on the bourse's exchange traded bonds and sukuk (etbs) platform. danainfra raised 300 million ringgit with a 10-year sukuk in january 2013 and 100 million ringgit with a 15-year sukuk in october. the issues targeted retail and corporate investors with limited access to the over-the-counter market in bonds, where investments must be done in large minimum sums. proceeds of danainfra's issues go towards extending the mass rapid transit network to cover the klang valley and kuala lumpur conurbation. negative perception danainfra's sukuk issues this year will serve to correct a \"negative perception\" that etbs bonds are more costly than raising funds on the otc bond market and equity market, jamaluddin said. danainfra's debut sukuk, the first on etbs and an entirely new type of product, had to be priced at a premium to attract investors. \"it was a one-time decision by the issuer for the inaugural issue. the message we are sending out is that premium pricing is not the only way out, or you don't have to go down that road.\" danainfra's second sukuk, priced based on otc rates, was oversubscribed 2.19 times. bursa malaysia is now courting several financial institutions and government-related agencies to be issuers on etbs. \"we continue to engage corporates on a direct basis, and explain all these intricacies and also put forward the incentives that have been put in place by the government.\" issuers enjoy a double deduction on expenses and are exempted from stamp duty until 2015. \"what we want to achieve here might not be reflected in monetary benefit on an immediate basis - this is a long-term commitment,\" jamaluddin said. retail interest malaysia's securities commission launched a framework in september 2012 for retail investors to buy into bonds and sukuk. etbs offers an opportunity for retail investors to diversify, although its new nature means it is often evaluated in the same way a stock would be, said jamaluddin. \"they are going back to typical equity-type thinking, chasing yields.\" danainfra, in an emailed statement to reuters, said the major challenges had been educating retail investors about the general structure of sukuk, and the net benefit of investing in danainfra relative to other products. retail investors took smaller portions of danainfra's sukuk than institutional buyers. \"we expect issuances in the immediate future to still be driven by institutional investors, nevertheless retail demand may gather momentum,\" said danainfra. maybank, cimb group holdings, rhb investment bank and aminvestment bank - lead arrangers or market-makers for the danainfra sukuk - have been informing retail investors about etbs. \"these things will enhance the ability to attract investors on the coming issuances,\" said jamaluddin. \"etbs is still in its infancy stage as an investment product, the education and development of the market still has a long way to go,\" said danainfra."},

meantime, the upside potential of some o&g counters that have risen substantially has already been priced into them. for example, the shares of umw oil & gas corp bhd (umw-og), which was listed just

stock with a revised target price for the stock of rm2.55 from rm1.90 following an 11% to 32% rise in its financial year 2013 (fy13) to fy15 earnings forecast. our analyst expects this outperformance to be fuelled by higher utilisation and lower operating expenses. with an improved cash flow and balance sheet position, perdana is well-positioned to expand its fleet size. our fundamental analyst thinks that the market has underestimated the stock but a strong fourth quarter fy13 result may spur investor optimism. a check on bloomberg consensus reveals nine brokers cover the stock. of these, seven have buy ratings, one has a sell call and one has a hold. the stock is currently trading at a lofty historical price-earnings ratio of 56.9 times and a very high price-to-book value of 2.6 times.  perdanas chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly timeframes are very strong indeed. its share price made an obvious surge since its weekly wave-4 low of rm1.19 in august 2013. since that rm1.19 low, perdana rose to its recent february 2014 high of rm1.96. its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to its recent february 2014 high of rm1.96. as it broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of rm1.51 and rm1.75, look to buy perdana on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to medium-term uptrends for this stock.  the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, oscillator, macd and stochastic) are very strong and now depict the obvious indications of perdanas eventual rise towards much higher levels. we expect perdana to remain very firm towards its support levels of rm1.51, rm1.75 and rm1.92. it will attract minor profit taking at the resistance levels of rm1.98, rm2.08 and rm2.44. its upside targets are now located at rm2.18, rm2.37, rm2.80 and rm3.12. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed in the article are the opinions of the writer
