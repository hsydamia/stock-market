1,200 of its current 11,000 employees under the mutual separation scheme (mss) that it recently launched to cut cost and improve efficiency, analysts say. the group will likely incur a one-off cost of about rm100 million from the mss, which will be reflected in its current financial year ending march 31, 2018 (fy18), maybank investment bank (ib) research said in a note to clients yesterday. however, the exercise will then result in cost savings, which is expected to boost the groups net profit from fy19. management targets cost savings of about rm60 million to rm70 million a year from its mss with a payback period of about one-and-a-half years, implying a one-off restructuring cost of about rm100 million, maybank ib research said, following an analyst briefing by ambank group recently. the research house has raised its fy19 and fy20 earnings forecasts for the group by 3.8% and 3.7% respectively, assuming cost savings of rm70 million a year. it has also lifted its return on equity forecasts for the group to 8.7% and 8.6% respectively, from 8.3% before. cimb research said while the mss would be negative for ambank groups fy18 earnings, the cost savings from this exercise would enhance its net profit from fy19. it estimated the mss cost of rm96 million to rm112 million would lower the groups fy18s net profit by 5%-6%. on tuesday, the edge financial daily reported that ambank group launched the mss on monday and that in an email to staff, it said eligible, confirmed employees of ambank, aminvestment bank and ambank islamic could apply for it over a two-week period until jan 19, 2018. it is understood that the mss does not extend to ambank groups insurance divisions 1,500 employees. as such, the mss will apply to about 9,500 staff, for which the take-up rate is estimated to be about 1,200, which is about 14% of the staff count (excluding insurance), maybank ib research said. ambank group is the sixth of malaysias eight local banking groups to launch a job rationalisation scheme in recent years. cimb group holdings bhd, rhb bank bhd, hong leong bank bhd, alliance bank bhd and affin holdings bhds investment banking arm had offered schemes in the past two to three years. in a more recent exercise, affin late last year shed just over 300 staff under a voluntary separation scheme. the banks have resorted to job rationalisation as they are more concerned than ever about becoming cost-efficient amid an increasingly challenging banking landscape that makes growing profits tougher. in ambank groups case, the groups cost-to-income ratio (cir)  at 57.2% as at the first half of fy18 (1hfy18)  is among the highest in the industry. with the mss, the group is unlikely to meet its target of bringing down cir to at least 55% in fy18. however, the exercise will help it improve cir over the longer term, analysts said. the announcement of the mss is not a surprise, given the groups rising cost structure where its cir rose from the recent low of 45% in fy14 to 57% in 1hfy18 versus peers average of 48%, uob kay hian research said in a report yesterday. the rising cost structure was largely due to new hires to ramp up the groups business banking franchise, it added. ambank groups net profit in 1hfy18 fell 2.35% year-on-year to rm659.74 million, while revenue rose 1.04% y-o-y to rm4.21 billion. bloomberg data shows that of 18 analysts that track the group, nine have a buy call on the stock, while six have a neutral, and three, a sell. the average 12-month target price is rm4.70. the stock closed up eight sen at rm4.56 yesterday,

pushed back", "article": " it looks like it may be a while yet before investors can buy into the popular kentucky fried chicken franchise business on bursa malaysia. the plan for an initial public offering (ipo) of qsr brands (m) holdings bhd, operator of the kfc and pizza hut restaurant chains, has been put on the back burner, sources say. its not off, its being kiv (kept in view) for the time being, a source familiar with the matter tells the edge. the ipo, work on which had started as early as last year, was expected to be one of the biggest this year, with previous reports indicating that it could raise between rm1.6 billion and rm2 billion. qsr, 51%-owned by johor corp, had picked maybank investment bank, citigroup and credit suisse to manage the flotation, with maybank ib as the principal adviser. the other shareholders of the countrys largest fast food operator are the employees provident fund (epf) and private equity firm cvc capital partners, with stakes of 25% and 24% respectively. sources say there are several reasons the ipo plan has dragged. for one, it is understood that us-based yum! brands inc, the owner of the kfc and pizza hut brands, has a key say in the planned listing. its approval is required for many things, right down to the prospectus, which slows things down somewhat. one of several issues being bandied about with yum! is whether qsrs upstream asset  an integrated upstream poultry feed/farm/processing business in malaysia  should be included as an asset of the listed company. according to sources, it was initially proposed to be carved out of the listing. there are pros and cons to having it in, one of the pros being that it provides certainty of supply to the restaurants, a source says. on the other hand, including it in means that qsr will not be a pure play on the quick service restaurant business and it may alter valuations as well. another reason cited for the delay in listing is thai beverage pcls reported interest in acquiring a substantial stake in the kfc and pizza hut business in malaysia. thai beverage  controlled by thailands third richest man, charoen sirivadhanabhakdi, and the brewer of chang beer  was reported in october to be keen to acquire the epf and cvcs combined 49% stake in qsr. this was after thai beverages move in august to acquire more than a third of the kfc outlets in thailand. it had agreed to buy some 240 restaurants from yum restaurants international (thailand) at a preliminary price of thb11.3 billion in a deal that was expected to be completed by the end of this year. epf and cvc declined to comment on whether they were in talks to sell their stakes to thai beverage. come january, it would be five years since cvc first invested in qsr, which is typically the timeframe when private equity firms look to make an exit. assuming epf and cvc were looking at a full exit from qsr, it would make better sense for them to sell their stakes outright. with an ipo, given the size of their stakes, they may not get a full exit, observes an investment banker. it may not be a bad idea for qsr to push back the ipo, some say. from a market perspective, i suspect theyd struggle to get the valuation they want. the kfc franchise is not what it used to be, theres so much new competition out there  theres the korean fried chicken craze, the increasingly popular mcdonalds fried chicken, to name but a few. i wouldnt be surprised if all of that plays into the whole equation, an industry source tells the edge. qsr has nevertheless performed decently despite the competition. a search with companies commission of malaysia shows that qsrs profit after tax grew to rm127.19 million on revenue of rm4.24 billion in its financial year ended dec 31, 2016 (fy2016). this compares with fy2015s rm69.67 million and rm4.02 billion respectively. in fy2014, it made a loss of rm54.24 million on revenue of rm3.85 billion. qsr managing director datuk mohamed azahari kamil, who was appointed to the post in august, declined to comment on the ipo. its up to the shareholders to decide. as for management, were busy working on our growth plans, he tells the edge. were looking at expanding and optimising our geographical presence in order to be more efficient, and coming out with new products for customers. qsr is the sole kfc franchisee in malaysia, singapore, brunei and cambodia. according to azahari, qsr currently has 1,247 kfc and pizza hut stores in the four markets, most of which (1,060) are in malaysia. the plan is to open 23 kfc outlets in malaysia next year. the quick-service restaurant group had previously been listed on bursa. in 2012, johor corp, together with the epf and cvc, took kfc holdings (m) bhd and its parent qsr brands bhd private in a rm5.2 billion deal that was completed in early 2013.

this year, permodalan nasional bhd (pnb) is looking at improving fundamental performance to drive returns from its major companies in 2018, according to group chairman tan sri abdul wahid omar during pnbs fourth-quarter media briefing today. with most of the restructuring exercises done or nearing completion, the spotlight will soon swivel to how the companies under pnb, the country's largest fund manager, perform post-restructuring. while the exercises were deemed to have unlocked value, which spurred market-beating returns for pnb this year, the question is whether the returns can be sustained in the coming years, after the excitement dies down. now that they have the right structure, the boards and the management can focus on their core businesses and get better allocation of capital, abdul wahid said. with the transparency of performance, we believe they can improve their fundamental performance. at the end of the day, it is about (the strategic companies) immediately growing their earnings, and with higher earnings, they can pay higher dividends (which leads to) higher share prices. so, the focus is on fundamental performance for 2018 onwards, abdul wahid added. the past year has seen conglomerate sime darby bhd carving out its plantation and property businesses to list them as separate entities  sime darby plantation and sime darby property  beginning nov 30. that follows the demerger of umw oil and gas bhd (umw-og) from conglomerate umw holdings bhd via a transfer of umws shareholding in umw-og to umws own shareholders. this was completed in july. a similar demerger is in progress in terms of chemical company of malaysia bhd and its listed subsidiary ccm duopharma biotech bhd, which is slated for completion on dec 30, according to pnb. on the property front, pnb completed the injection of its privately-held property developer i&p group bhd into listed sp setia group bhd on dec 1, for rm3.65 billion cash. this creates the third-largest malaysian developer by landbank at roughly 10,000 acres, behind uem sunrise bhd (about 13,000 acres) and sime darby property bhd (20,763 acres). separately, on july 31, pnb's wholly-owned property arm pnb development sdn bhd completed the purchase of the 40% it did not own in seriemas development sdn bhd from sime darby bhd for rm625 million. pnb development will spearhead pnbs land banking exercise, going forward, with 9,697 acres of land currently owned, pnb said. what weve done in 2017 had been to address some structural issues. for some of the companies, we felt they are better off being demerged into pure-plays. at the same time, we also believe in strengthening some of the core businesses as well, abdul wahid said on the slew of corporate exercises. market-beating returns as the corporate exercises unfolded, pnb strategic companies had outperformed the local stock market this year. for example, the collective market value of the three sime darby counters is now over rm60.53 billion, nearly 10% higher than the original conglomerates rm55.09 billion market capitalisation in december 2016. in the case of sp setia, its total shareholders' return (tsr) year-to-date is at 21.2% for the past one-year period, according to pnb chief executive officer datuk abdul rahman ahmad. he said the corresponding tsr in the past couple of years were 5.4% (2016) and 0.2% (2015). overall, the collective performance of pnbs strategic companies is twice that of the benchmark fbmklci index, abdul rahman said. at the end of trading hours today, the fbmklci stood at 1,760.24 points, up 7.22% year-to-date. in terms of total shareholders return, we delivered 18.1% compared to fbmklcis tsr of 10.3%, abdul rahman said during the briefing. in terms of value, we have increased the (total) market capitalisation of these companies by more than rm27 billion. that had contributed to stronger performance for pnb in 2017, the duos first full year at the helm. as at nov 30, pnbs net income grew 7.1% y-o-y to rm15.4 billion. it declared a total income distribution of 8.25 sen for its unitholders, or a total of rm10.7 billion. that pay-out comprises 7 sen per unit plus 0.25 sen in bonus dividend out of pnbs proprietary funds. another 1 sen will be paid as a special bonus to mark pnbs 40th anniversary next year, although this anniversary dividend will only be paid for the first 10,000 units held by every unitholder. the corporate restructuring drive was sparked by pnbs six-year strive-15 plan up to 2020, which aims to enhance corporate returns from pnbs stable of companies sustainably. the plan was rolled out by abdul wahid and abdul rahman in november 2016, after they took charge of pnb. it was pnbs first leadership change in two decades. the plan defines strategic companies, as those where pnb holds majority shareholding. the next layer is its core companies, whereby pnb has 10% or rm1 billion in shareholding value. pnb now has nine strategic companies: maybank, sp setia, the sime darby companies, umw companies, reinsurer mnrb holdings bhd and chemical company of malaysia bhd. the chemical company of malaysia demerger will create a tenth. in august, abdul wahid told the edge that pnb will move on to enhance its core companies in collaboration with other shareholders, after the strategic companies restructuring is completed. the malaysian market is the mainstay of pnbs investments, as over 98% of its asset allocation remains in malaysia. as at nov 2017, its asset under management (aum) has grown 4.6% y-o-y to rm276.5 billion. that pace puts pnb on track to hitting its 2020 target of rm350 billion in aum, abdul rahman said today. as at nov 2017, its investments are 70.8% in equities (from 69.9% a year ago); 5.6% in fixed income (nov 2016: 3.9%); 3.4% in real property (versus 3.3% in nov 2016); and 2% in private equity (2.6% in nov 2016). its cash holdings as of last month made up 17.9% of its assets, a reduction from 19.8% a year ago, as pnb sought to hold less cash and redeploy them into investments."}, "4": {"date_posted": "18/12/2017", "title": "review of top stock picks", "article": " the edge financial dailys

investors who allocate about a total of rm10,000 to the list or an equal rm1,000 investment in each of the 10 stocks will see a return of about rm1,500 ytd. there were, however, some disappointments as oil and gas companies were not rebounding in line with the recovery in crude oil price at above us$60 (rm244.80) per barrel. some companies like gamuda bhd and magni-tech industries bhd saw a strong first half, similar to most of the companies on the bursa malaysia stock exchange, but, eventually, lost momentum as we entered into the third quarter of the year with negative news flow and disappointing earnings results. some companies managed to turn around the corner in terms of their financial results but share-price performance continued to disappoint. export-driven companies like inari amertron bhd continued to outperform with better results and share-price performance. on average, the selection managed to outperform the domestic market but returns were short of impressive when compared with returns of our regional peers, which mostly saw a strong double-digit growth ytd.  inari amertron bhd top performer of the stock picks, inari maintained its strong performance from 2016 into 2017 as the group continued to see improvements in its earnings. for the groups financial results for its first quarter of financial year 2018 (1qfy18) ended sept 30, 2017, its net profit increased by 42.4% to rm68.4 million while its revenue grew by 32.5% to rm373.1 million. it is worth noting that inari has consistently recorded year-on-year growth of its bottom line since 4qfy16 while it has maintained a double-digit growth for its revenue since 2qfy17. the company, which was selected at the beginning of the year in anticipation of the positive impact from iphones 10th anniversary, has seen a strong and growing demand for premium radio frequency (rf) filters in 2017. according to kevin low from affin hwang investment bank bhd, inaris rf testers have grown to 960 units currently and are projected to reach 1,000 units by year end. investors who bought into the company at the end of last year would have seen a return of 110.3% from their investment, which is in line with the strong performance among semiconductor and tech-related companies globally. the strong performance is consistent with its annualised return of 100.4% in the last five years. at its closing price of rm3.36 last friday, the company is trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio (per) of 26.7 times with an indicated dividend yield of 2.6%.  by billy toh  magni-tech industries bhd the top performer in the first half of 2017 saw its share price fall after the largest original manufacturer for nike in malaysia recorded a declining result for both its 1qfy18 ended july 30, 2017 and 2qfy18. despite the drop, it still manage to record a gain of 41.4% ytd. the garment makers 1qfy18 net profit was lower by 16.8% from a year ago at rm19.6 million mainly due to net foreign exchange (forex) loss of rm1.3 million compared to a net forex gain of rm3.4 million in 1qfy17 as well as higher operating expenses such as the impact of higher minimum wages both locally and in vietnam. the consecutive quarter of lower profit in 2qfy18, where magni-tech recorded a lower revenue and net profit, hurt its share price further as it fell by 6.3% to rm5.63 following the announcement of its 2qfy18 results. inter-pacific researchs head of research, pong teng siew, has maintained a buy call on magni-tech with a lower target price (tp) of rm6.78. in his report dated dec

one of the main beneficiaries from the rollout of new major infrastructure projects in malaysia, but it saw a relatively quiet year as it only managed a return of about 1.8% ytd. the company had a strong first half this year, which saw a total return of about 14.3% when it closed at an eight-year high of rm5.44 per share. the wave of optimism, however, fizzled out after mass rapid transit corp sdn bhds mass rapid transit line 3 (mrt3) tender process required bidders to provide financing for the public rail project. the requirement could rule out any malaysian contractor being the lead contractor, due to relative balance sheet risks. with the need to provide financing  the turnkey contractor has to come up with a financing proposal for at least 90% of the project value, which could potentially cost more than rm30 billion and a moratorium for the first eight years  gamuda might see its role in mrt3 potentially reduced. as the construction company has historically been the biggest beneficiary due to its project delivery partner role and healthy margins for tunneling, investors reacted negatively to the news flow and caused its share price to fall by 12.9% to rm4.58 on nov 21 from its closing of rm5.26 on oct 30. gamuda is now trading at a trailing per of 18 times, giving it a market capitalisation of rm11.7 billion.  by billy toh  classic scenic bhd classic scenic bhd is the dividend play for our stock pick as it offers a decent dividend yield of about 5.9%. the wooden picture frame manufacturer has a strong operating cash flow to support its dividend payout. while the companys share-price performance for 2017 has remained subdued with a total return of about 0.24% ytd, long-term investors would still have seen an annualised return of about 18.2% in the past 10 years. the groups underperformance was mainly due to weaker financial results in its 2qfy17 ended june 30, 2017 and 3qfy17. for its 2qfy17, classic scenics net profit fell by 6.8% to rm3.4 million from rm3.6 million in the corresponding quarter a year ago mainly due to lower sales revenue. the higher labour costs and operating expenses as a result of lower forex gain on derivatives also hurt its profitability. similarly, for its 3qfy17, the groups net profit fell by 8.2% to rm3 million compared with rm3.2 million in 3qfy16. its management, however, has been positive about consumer spending in the near term on the back of ongoing strength seen in the labour market. in its note filed with bursa malaysia, it also shared that the group is making every effort to weather the external challenges by focusing more on development of new marketable products and coming out with other operational improvements. with its strong net cash position of rm22.1 million as at sept 30 this year, the group remains at a comfortable level to maintain its dividend payout.  by billy toh  protasco bhd continuous declining financial results in the current financial year have taken away the optimism of investors on the outlook for protasco bhd. touted as one of the companies to benefit from a possible early 14th general election (ge14) for potentially extra emergency road maintenance work, the edge financial daily listed protasco as one of the stock picks for the year. however, the company has underperformed in both its financial results and its share price, with a loss of about 3% ytd. the groups net profit for its 2qfy17 ended june 30, 2017 fell by 45% to rm7.9 million. similarly, for its 3qfy17, protasco saw its net profit drop by 28% to rm10.3 million. with the weaker financial results and a lack of news flow on contracts win, hong leong investment bank research has downgraded its rating from buy to hold in its latest report on nov 30, with a lower tp of rm1.14 from rm1.20. it pointed out that there is a pickup for its road maintenance business as seen in its 3qfy17 and is hopeful that public spending on road maintenance could pick up in the near term as we draw closer to the impending ge14. despite the weaker performance in 2017, bloomberg data show that consensus tp is at rm1.30, indicating a potential return of 25%. at current levels, protasco is trading at a trailing per of 18.3 times, giving it a market capitalisation of rm441.2 million. it also has a decent dividend yield of 5.8%, which is one of the highest among the construction players.  by billy toh  ta ann holdings bhd sarawak-based ta ann holdings bhd was selected as one of the stock picks for the year in anticipation of improved demand for timber as well as the turnaround for the plantation sector at the beginning of the year. it, however, saw another disappointing year in 2017 as its share price fell by 7.3% ytd despite the stronger financial results for its first nine months of fy17 (9mfy17) ended sept 30, 2017. the companys 9mfy17 net profit edged higher by 2.3% to rm95.8 million from rm93.6 million in 9mfy16, contributed by the better crude palm oil (cpo) and fresh fruit bunch (ffb) average selling prices by 14% and 11% respectively as well as the higher sales volume of 11% and 13% for cpo and ffb respectively. affin hwang investment bhd analyst, nadia aquidah, maintains her buy call on ta ann with a tp of rm4.25 as she believes that plantation division earnings growth would be able to partially offset the drop in timber division earnings for 2018. we believe it will be a challenging environment going forward for the timber division given an increase in hill timber premium as well as reduction in the export quota, she said in her report on nov 28. bloomberg data show that there are three buy calls and six hold calls, with an average 12-month tp of rm3.90, indicating a potential return of 9.6% from its current price of rm3.56. at current level, ta ann is trading at a trailing per of 12.8 times, giving it a market capitalisation of rm1.6 billion.  by billy toh  sapura energy bhd sapura energy bhd was the worst performer among our stock picks for the year with a decline of 51.3% ytd after its share price took a beating recently following the announcement of its results for 3qfy18 ended oct 31, 2017 that saw a net loss of rm274.4 million. the poorer-than-expected financial performance took place despite the oil price hovering at us$63.26 per barrel as of writing. recall that sapura energy was selected as one of the stock picks for the year as it could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the oil production cut between opec and non-opec members. in line with the o&g sectors recovery theme on improved sentiment following gradual recovery in oil prices, most analysts are optimistic about a turnaround story for sapura energy. bloomberg data show that the average 12-month tp for the group is at about rm1.28, indicating a potential return of 62% from its current price of 78.5 sen. following the announcement of its financial results as well as the decline in its share price, analysts have made changes to the recommendation with midf research downgrading sapura energy to hold while kenanga reduced the stock to underperform. cimb research and maybank investment bank research remain positive about sapura energy, as cimb upgraded the stock to buy with a lower tp of rm1.42 from rm1.63 while maybank ib research kept its buy call on the stock with a lower tp of rm1.20 from its previous rm2.  by samantha ho  genting malaysia bhd expectation of an influx of visitors from china to the hilltop casino resort put genting malaysia back on many institutional investors buying list. in addition, the progressive launch of the genting integrated tourism plan also raised expectation of better earnings. given the fresh growth catalysts, genting malaysia was listed as one of the edge financial dailys stock picks for the year. the return of foreign interest on bursa malaysia in the first half of the year helped fuel the share-price rally. the stock started the year on a firm note and it climbed to record-high rm6.14 from rm4.60  a strong rally that had not happened in five years, at least. genting malaysia, which was once foreign investors darling, garnered less attention since some macau-based casino operators and its sister company genting singapore plc were listed in hong kong and singapore respectively. however, the rally lost steam as genting malaysias earnings performance did not meet expectations in its 2qfy17 ended june 30, 2017 and 3qfy17. furthermore, foreign selling in the second half of the year dragged the counter to a low of rm4.90, down 20% from the peak. for its 3qfy17, stripping out various exceptional items, genting malaysias core profit was down by 45% to rm259 million. analysts noticed that the groups costs had gone up, such as staff and finance costs, which hurt its profitability.  by kathy fong  sime darby bhd the change of guard at sime darby bhds controlling shareholder permodalan nasional bhd (pnb) threw the diversified conglomerate into the limelight. expectation of pnbs chairman tan sri abdul wahid omar restructuring sime darby to unlock asset value prompted many to take a second look at the big-cap counter. in january, sime darby announced its restructuring exercise. the conglomerate adopted a pure play strategy, breaking the group into three listed entities, namely sime darby bhd, which houses the auto, industrial, logistics and other businesses; sime darby plantation bhd and sime darby property bhd. shares in the plantation and property arms were distributed to shareholders. meanwhile, both sime darby plantation and sime darby property were listed by introduction on bursa malaysia without issuing new shares to raise fresh capital. the listing reference price for sime darby plantation was pegged at rm5.59 while sime darby propertys was rm1.50. given the renewed interest, sime darbys share price staged a rally, climbing from the rm8-level to a four-year high of rm9.62. if an investor had 1,000 sime darby shares at the start of the year, he would have gained about 8.52% as of dec 15 by holding 1,000 shares in each of sime darby listed members now. sime darby closed at rm2.12, sime darby plantation rm5.25 and sime darby property rm1.42 last friday.  by kathy fong  bumi armada bhd bumi armada bhd, which is controlled by tycoon tan sri ananda krishnan, is one of the two o&g stocks among the edge financial dailys stock picks for the year. the worlds largest floating production storage and offloading (fpso) operator fell victim to the fierce selldown in the o&g sector for two years, falling from the height of rm2.60 in 2014 to nearly 50 sen late last year. it was hammered down to oversold zone then. bumi armadas share price rebounded this year, although not strongly. it climbed above 80 sen in april; it

its 9mfy17 ended sept 30, 2017 after it had been loss-making for two years. the group posted a net profit of rm288.4 million, a sharp contrast to a net loss of rm591.6 million in the previous corresponding period. revenue ballooned almost 44% to rm1.74 billion against rm1.211 billion a year ago. the groups better performance was mainly boosted by the four major floating production and operation projects, which have been coming online in stages. bumi armadas firm order book as of sept 30 was approximately rm22.7 billion, with additional optional extensions of up to rm13.1 billion,

lumpur: a potential hike in the overnight policy rate (opr) and the implementation of the malaysian financial reporting standard 9 (mfrs 9) are expected to impact the earnings of the banking sector in 2018. most economists have priced in one opr hike by bank negara malaysia next year, while some see two increases if the economy were to grow much faster than expected. midf research analyst imran yassin md yusof expects the net interest margin (nim) of banks to improve slightly from this year due to the potential opr hike. we view that the opr hike will be beneficial to banks, especially those with a higher retail portion of their loans book and higher percentage of mortgages, imran told the edge financial daily. however, there may be some [nim] compression next year due to the net stable funding ratio (nsfr) implementation in 2019 that will moderate the opr hike impact  but, in our view, this will be benign. the implementation of the nsfr will come into effect no later than jan 1, 2019. it is a liquidity standard under basel iii that requires banking institutions to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance sheet activities. alliancedbs research said banks with a larger share of variable-rate loans and a strong current and savings account (casa) base are expected to benefit from an opr hike, provided there is no uptick in asset quality. based on our sensitivity analysis, every 25bps (basis points) hike in opr would raise sector earnings by 2%. we currently assume flat nim trends in 2018, the research firm said in a recent note.  nims to be slightly better aminvestment bank analyst kelvin ong expects nims to be slightly better in 2018 compared with 2017, with a projected improvement of 3bps year-on-year (y-o-y). we expect some repricing of loans to happen in 2018 as a result of the implementation of mfrs 9. with mfrs 9 in place, the banks would have to make more provisions, hence we expect some upward repricing of loans to compensate for the additional provisions, he told the edge financial daily. ong opined that the deferment of the implementation of the nsfr to jan 1, 2019 from the initial date of jan 1, 2018 has lessened competition among banks for deposits. we are seeing some competition among banks for deposits at present, but it is not so intense. also, should the opr hike happen, there will be some improvement to nims as interests earned on loans given would go up first, before the adjustment to interest paid out on deposits catches up, he said. ong said the impact from the implementation of mfrs 9 is expected to be manageable for the banks. the impact [on capital ratios] could range from 25 to 90bps, and we think this is quite a manageable impact for the banks. the day one impact of mfrs 9 to banks would go towards the balance sheet via an adjustment to banks retained earnings, and this will affect banks common equity tier 1 (cet1) ratios, he said. mfrs 9, which comes into force on jan 1, 2018, requires banks to change the way they make loan loss provisions. they will have to make provisions in anticipation of future losses rather than the current practice of making provisions only when loans have been classified as impaired.  loan growth maybank ib research, in a banking sector note last week, lowered its aggregate loan growth forecast for 2018 to 4.2% from an earlier forecast of 4.7%, following the conclusion of the financial results reporting season for the third quarter of 2017 (3q17). the firm had also pared its 2017 loan growth forecast to 3%, from 4.7% previously. industry loan growth slipped further to 4.6% y-o-y in october 2017 from 5.2% y-o-y in september 2017 as non-household loan growth eased further to 4.1% y-o-y from 5.4% y-o-y in september. however, household loan growth maintained its pace at 5.1% y-o-y from 5% y-o-y in september 2017. on an annualised basis, the upward trend in household loan growth was more pronounced, picking up from an annualised pace of just 3% in feb 2017 to 4.5% in october 2017. annualised loan growth for non-household loans was just 1.5% in october 2017. annualised loan growth for the industry was 3.2% in october 2017, the research house said. alliancedbs, meanwhile, noted that loan growth in 2017 has been challenging for banks. loan growth for 3q17 was weak. although there are hopes for a slight rebound in 4q17, loan growth may end the year at only 4% at best. we expect some loan growth recovery in 2018 premised on the spillover from the persistently strong gdp growth. loan growth tends to lag gdp growth by two to three quarters. our loan growth base-case assumption is 5% for 2018, said the firm. as for the banking stock picks, midfs imran had buy calls on a few banks including cimb group holdings bhd with a target price of rm7.10, with the premise that the banking group would see better loan growth and nim in 2018, and an improvement in earnings in thailand and indonesia. alliancedbs top picks included malayan banking bhd (maybank) with a target price of rm10.70. maybank is staging a strong rebound with improved credit costs and no further impairment surprises; its high casa ratio as well as its strong position in capital markets and islamic banking gives it a leg up in the current operating environment, the firm said.  syariah-compliant investments alliancedbs said the creation of more investable syariah equity opportunities in the financial sector, mooted by permodalan nasional bhd (pnb), could spark interest in the sector. in august, pnb was reported to be studying a potential issuance of islamic shares (i-shares) by maybank which will be linked to the islamic banking business of the group. pnb controls 51% of maybank. apart from potentially designating part of maybanks share base as i-shares, we could see a twist involving maybank islamic bhd which may be housed with [the midf group which is wholly owned by pnb]. this is based on reports that midf could be seeking a relisting and obtain an islamic banking licence. we believe other banks may follow suit with the i-share designation if maybank successfully pulls this off, said alliancedbs."}, "6": {"date_posted": "5/10/2017", "title": "special report: findings of rci into bank negaras forex losses", "article": " in the just-concluded royal commission of inquiry (rci) into bank negara malaysias foreign exchange losses  pegged at rm32.07 billion  it was learnt that the central bank moved from its conventional practice of preserving reserves through asset management to actively participating in the forex market for profits in the late 1980s and early 1990s. most of the witnesses who testified pinned the policy change squarely on the late bank negara governor tan sri jaffar hussein, who served from june 1985 to may 1994. jaffar was a corporate banker who served as malayan banking bhds ceo, before being seconded to head the central bank. he resigned from the central bank in 1994 and passed away at the age of 67 on aug 11, 1998. throughout the nine-day inquiry, several witnesses claimed that jaffar played down the losses or hid them from the government, but later, as the matter blew up in 1994, said he would get the bank out of the mess he created. the rci heard that the forex losses depleted two-thirds of the central banks reserves. to cover the losses, some 123 million telekom malaysia bhd shares and 47 million tenaga nasional bhd shares were discreetly transferred at par value and sold to shore up the reserves. the inquiry learnt that forex trading activities were conducted in a cloak-and-dagger manner with hardly anyone, apart from the in-house dealers, banking department head and jaffar, in the know. daily trades, which could amount to more than us$1 billion per dealer, involved the buying and selling of the us dollar, deutschmark, yen, pound sterling, swiss franc and french franc. as revealed by the rci conducting officers, bank negaras forex losses apparently amounted to rm12.35 billion in 1992, rm15.29 billion in 1993 and rm3.86 billion in 1994, but only rm5.7 billion was recorded as deferred expenditure in 1993. the last figure, audited by the then auditor-general tan sri ishak tadin, and bank negaras annual report were presented to the cabinet and later tabled in parliament by the then finance minister datuk seri anwar ibrahim. interestingly, it is also the only figure often cited as losses suffered in the 1990s, although it was for just one year  1993. and this is despite bank negaras report titled the accounting treatment of losses arising from active reserve management 1988-1994, which was presented to the government on april 18, 2007, during former bank negara governor tan sri zeti akhtar azizs tenure. zeti told the rci that the forex losses accrued in that period amounted to rm32.07 billion. however, former prime minister tun dr mahathir mohamad and the then finance minister tun daim zainuddin both claimed that they were not aware of the huge losses. dr mahathir maintained that he was only aware of forex losses amounting to rm5.7 billion in the early 1990s, and not rm30 billion. if i had known the losses were rm30 billion, i would not have said sometimes we lose, sometimes we win or sometimes we make profits and sometimes we make losses, he said when queried by the panel. whereas daim, who served as finance minister for the first time from july 1984 to march 1991, rubbished bank negaras forex trading as it was not a central banks role to do so, and chided it for not protecting the ringgit and reserves. he said he only learnt of the losses in 1994 because everything was under the official secrets act 1972. even anwar, who was aware of the additional rm9.5 billion losses (the difference between rm15.29 billion and rm5.7 billion) in 1993, said he was bound by the 1993 annual report that was audited by ishak, which showed losses of rm5.7 billion. ishak is said to have known about the massive losses because he cited its seriousness in a letter dated march 31, 1993, to anwar, which prompted the latter to see to the matter urgently. but anwar claimed that ishak signed the audited accounts that maintained the forex losses at rm5.7 billion. the most startling testimony must have been tan sri nor mohamed yakcops  he admitted to mistakenly hedging 100% on the currency instead of 60% or less. nor mohamed was the manager of the banking department, which was involved in forex trading then. he said in the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a large inflow of us dollars, the stock market was booming and, in terms of market valuation, malaysias was among the highest in the world. high-ticket industries were being set up and us dollars were coming in, but at the time, the us dollar was weakening because there was talk of the fortress euro  a concept that various european nations were doing well after world war ii. it was said that europe, including the uk, would overtake the us as the strongest economy in the world. we subscribed to this view and bought european currencies, including the pound sterling, he said. unfortunately, the european currencies crashed after the non-ratification of the maastricht treaty by denmark in february 1992. on this, dr mahathir defended jaffar, whose idea it was to trade in forex. he said jaffar was engaged in currency speculation, not manipulation, but he had miscalculated the non-ratification of the maastricht treaty. the losses were a result of forex manipulators, who would sell currencies they dont have in order to reduce the value, he added. now with the rci over, the forex losses still remain a puzzle, owing to the fact that jaffar has died and ishak is medically unfit to testify. as lawyer datuk gurdial singh nijar, who held a watching brief for anwar, said there are huge gaps in the chain of evidence due to the absence of jaffar and ishak, who both served at the material time. he said it was not known why there was a difference in the amount of losses referred to in the documents and annual report. and so, it remains to be seen what the outcome of the rci is as the commissioners submit their recommendations to the yang di-pertuan agong on oct 13. the rci went on for nine days from aug 8, with 25 witnesses testifying and 42 documents presented to the five-man panel chaired by petroliam nasional bhd chairman tan sri mohd sidek hassan. the other commissioners were high court judge datuk wira kamaluddin md said, bursa malaysia bhd ceo datuk seri tajuddin atan, malaysian productivity corps special task force to facilitate business co-chairman tan sri saw choo boon and malaysian institute of accountants member k pushpanathan. the rci was set up upon a special task forces recommendation following former bank negara assistant governor datuk abdul murad khalids statement on jan 27 that the central bank suffered losses of us$10 billion in the 1990s.

the group has bagged two projects so far. its maiden project being the pantai 2 sewerage treatment plant (pantai 2 stp), a centralised waste water treatment facility which was completed in july last year at a total cost of about rm983.25 million. the project was awarded to the group by the ministry of energy, green technology and water in july 2011. then in november 2015, begm malaysia was awarded a design and build contract valued at approximately rm687 million to refurbish and upgrade water treatment and distribution facilities in kemaman by the terengganu state government. the group is partly financing the terengganu job via proceeds from a rm400 million islamic medium term notes (sukuk wakalah) issuance, making it the first china-owned company to issue ringgit-denominated sukuk for water infrastructure funding. the sukuk wakalah was fully subscribed at the point of its launch on july 19, 2017, and carries a rating of aais (stable) by malaysian rating corp bhd. bewg malaysia chief financial officer mustakim mat nun said that the issuance of sukuk provides a competitive advantage to the group. we are a water industry player [providing] a to z [solutions], so by issuing sukuk we have added on to our expertise, as not only are we doing the project but we are also doing the fund raising through islamic issuance. so basically if we are going to implement it in other projects, this has given us a very good advantage compared with other competitors in the industry, he said. bewg malaysias news conference yesterday was in conjunction with the signing ceremony with its investment banks for the sukuk issuance. cimb investment bank bhd and maybank investment bank bhd are the joint principal advisers, joint lead arrangers and joint lead managers for the sukuk

exports in august and copper hit a two-year high, according to reuters. the dollar edged up after hitting its lowest level since june 2016 as the federal reserve began a two-day policy meeting, it said. the dow jones industrial average was up 100.26 points, or 0.47 percent, to 21,613.43, the s&p 500 gained 7.17 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,477.08 and the nasdaq composite added 1.37 points, or

positive note. the research house said the benchmark index subsequently traded higher to 1,766.47, but weak follow through buying interest prompted selling pressure to chip in. it said this pushed the

higher. that gave a market breadth of 0.64 indicating the bears were in better control, it said. alliancedbs research said the market made a higher high on july 25 with the benchmark index reached a high of 1,766.47. given the crossover of the 1,761 hurdle on settlement basis on july 24, some market participants apparently had taken the chance to buy into the market. however, many market participants were still seen not that excited about the crossover of the 1,761 level at this juncture as they were not convinced of a market reversal. this was evidenced from the market fall back to the low of 1,761.16 after hitting the days high of 1,766.47, it said. the research house said that in other words, the market was going through a wild fluctuation which had made the trading

only been in recent years that the platforms have gained traction with banks  their clients  and the public. most, if not all banks here, foreign and local, are working with at least one comparison site to reach out to consumers. today, there are six comparison sites  up from three in 2013. the six are ringgitplus, imoney, loanstreet, comparehero, bolehcompare and gobear. according to industry players, these sites  which are also online financial aggregators  saw an average of 300,000 monthly visitors in 2013 and that has grown to 2.5 million today. in the uk, moneysupermarket.com saw on average 23.4 million unique visitors a month last year. in malaysia, there were about 500 credit card approvals via comparison sites in 2013, and that has increased to 80,000 year to date. personal loan approvals also saw an uptick, rising from 300 to 18,000 in the same period. personal loan disbursements from online financial aggregators have expanded from rm5 million in 2013 to rm300 million today, the head of a comparison site, who declined to be named, tells the edge. interestingly, in the first quarter this year, comparison sites accounted for over 30% of credit card sales and over 50% of personal loans out of all digital sales for the industry, notes deniz guven, global head of design and client experience at standard chartered. a customer who is comparison shopping for a loan on this channel has already explicitly demonstrated interest in a financial product. from a return on investment perspective, comparison sites have proved to be highly effective paid marketing channels and they consistently contribute a high volume of sales to our overall digital sales numbers, he tells the edge. we see the value in financial comparison sites. not only do they deliver convenience, value and credibility to customers, they offer greater transparency. customers can clearly see what products and rates they are eligible for. for banks, online comparison sites provide insights into sales trends and the direction of market demand. financial institutions need be where the customers are, says malayan banking bhd group chief strategy officer michael foong. customers today still do go to bank branches to understand [the] products, but their initial point of research would be online. but where online? well, they either go to the individual bank websites or to comparison sites where it is easier to compare the products across several banks. if a particular bank is not on the site, it could miss out on a potential customer. however, what we have found in countries like malaysia, where there is a manageable number of banks, customers do take the time to research products and services beyond comparison sites. some use comparison sites as a starting point, he says. financial comparison websites are online portals that allow users to compare financial products and services, such as fixed deposit accounts, mortgages, credit cards and personal loans. the sites list the prevailing rates and terms of financial products, and provide online application services. the sites receive a fee from the banks, such as a referral fee. while comparison sites are not listed locally, the uk site moneysupermarket.com shows that the business model is profitable. listed on the london stock exchange, the groups net profit increased 16% year on year to u00a373.5 million for its financial year ended dec 31, 2016, and revenue rose 12% to u00a3316.4 million in the same period. indeed, moneysupermarket.com, which is over 20 years old, did have a head start and the platform has expanded its product offerings to include comparing travel packages and mobile phone deals. at home, while malaysian sites are still building up their offerings, what is certain is that banks and consumers are making a beeline for the digital sphere. naturally, banks want to go where the customers are and there is a sizeable market of digital-savvy consumers in malaysia today, says siew yuen tuck, ceo of jirnexu sdn bhd (formerly known as saving plus sdn bhd), which owns ringgitplus. we see consistent growth, thanks to internet growth. one big shift, which has been very lucky for comparison sites, is the broader interest in fintech (financial technology) that started last year. before that, there was definitely a sense within the banking industry to venture into the tech space u2026 but the big explosion was last year with the fintech initiatives launched for the industry. that helped create a sense of urgency for fintech businesses, ideas and services, says siew, the co-founder of ringgitplus, which was established five years ago. as to why banks would rather work with third parties than build their own platforms, siew believes it is because financial institutions want to work with companies that specialise in specific tech areas when it comes to certain segments, rather than spend time building it themselves. the solutions and services comparison sites offer are based on specific core specialities. from what i have observed, it is difficult for banks to build certain tech solutions quickly. and it is not just the banks that face this difficulty  in any industry where a large corporate is trying to build tech solutions, you have a situation of the smaller specialised company that has focus, speed and agility versus the larger corporates that have bureaucratic red tape, he says. benny chee, managing director of comparehero.my  a three-year-old entrant to the local market  says: comparison sites offer banks a wider and different reach to consumers. for example, a bank that is limited to 10 branches nationwide will now have a different touch point with the general public, and more beneficial, a seriously untapped customer profile of the young, savvy and affluent. inflows of young customers will essentially bring forward the general life cycle, adding more years of critical data and an overall increase of lifetime value. online is definitely the future. businesses are moving towards online and banks are no exception. however, core banking it systems are usually dated and less flexible, hence, fintechs are filling the void. the current economic climate and pressure on banks to reduce their cost-to-income ratio are the top priority, leading to the existence of non-biased financial comparison sites like ourselves. on top of that, we make it our mission to educate consumers on financial literacy and match them with the right products that suit their needs and spending patterns, at zero cost to them. he says the most popular choices on comparison sites are credit cards and personal loans as they give consumers a full view of the local landscape and product offerings. this helps save time on research, and with the right overview, they can to decide on the best product that suits their needs. while the malaysian market is still very much focused on basic financial products, there is a huge opportunity for more sophisticated ones in the future, such as investment-linked products, insurance or convoluted loan packages that require more information and explanation, chee says. maybanks foong points out that if the current model of financial comparison sites is maintained, they will continue to complement banks. they may benefit from referral fees, if any, and the banks get the customer reach, he says. stancharts guven believes that banks and comparison sites have a symbiotic relationship that will continue for the long term.

bursa malaysia yesterday, is confident in its growth prospects in light of stabilising prices of crude oil, which makes up its core feedstock. however, it is not the same for some investors judging by the share price performance on its listing day. the petrochemical group opened at its revised initial public offering (ipo) price of rm6.50, and hit rm6.53 shortly after the opening bell. then it drifted south, touching a low of rm6.33. the stock closed at rm6.38 yesterday, down 12 sen or 1.85%. trading volume was large at 292.8 million shares, making it the second-most actively traded counter on bursa. in a filing with bursa in the evening, maybank investment bank bhd said it had bought 17.1 million shares in lct to stabilise the groups share price. it bought the shares at rm6.4718 apiece, for rm110.67 million in all. lct is the largest ipo since 2012 on bursa, and the second counter that ended the listing day below the ipo price after kip reit this year. speaking to the press after its listing ceremony, lct vice-president (corporate planning) philip kong said that the company, as a cracker operator, is comfortable with crude oil prices at us$47 (rm202.10) per barrel presently. at this moment, the spread from the conversion of polyolefin into feedstock naphtha is still at us$700 per tonne. this is a very comfortable [level] for us. oil prices [have] traded between us$30 and us$60 per barrel over the last three years. we believe that there will be no sudden spike in the pricing in the next two years, and we are comfortable with anything below us$60 per barrel, he said. crude oil contains ethane, which forms the base of olefin and polyolefin products. lct produces both bases, and currently operates three naphtha cracker plants in indonesia and malaysia combined. kong is betting on southeast asia as a strong demand growth area for its products in the next three years, brushing off claims that the market is oversupplied. the southeast asian market, said kong, can absorb the supply coming in from its expansion plans in malaysia and indonesia moving forward. there is strong growing demand in malaysia and indonesia. we believe the market can absorb [the supply] of polyolefin products, and independent market researchers share a similar view, said kong. on its us$3 billion shale gas project, kong said the group had secured full funding for its joint venture with its 74% shareholder lotte chemical corp for the project, which involves the development of an ethane cracker complex and a monoethylene glycol plant there. the us shale project is meant for north american, chinese and european markets, said kong. he was responding to pundits views that the market for polyolefin is oversupplied, subduing investor interest in its ipo. lcts ipo was priced at rm6.50, down from rm8 established in its prospectus. it was also downsized by about 33% via a cut-down in issuance to institutional investors after a price discovery review. our principal adviser has determined [that a] share price at between rm7.60 and rm8 as [the] fair value, but ultimately, the price is a function of demand and supply. our decision was [made] in order to secure long-term, high-quality foreign and domestic institutional investors. market researchers are confident in our spread and profitability over the next two years, and we hope that it will be reflected in the aftermarket value [of lcts share price], said kong. with the proceeds being lower than the rm5.9 billion initially planned, lct has cut down the allocation to fund its rm15 billion indonesian integrated petrochemical facility from up to rm4.9 billion to rm2.8 billion. kong is, however, confident that the group has enough internal funding to make up for the lesser amount. as at [the] first quarter, we had cash of rm425 million, he said, emphasising the groups cash position, while not discounting the possibility of opting for borrowings.\n"}, "16": {"date_posted": "12/7/2017", "title":

earnings season off to a solid start", "article": " the earnings season for the quarter ended march 31 has been touted as the defining moment for the rally seen in the stock market this year. investors are closely monitoring the numbers to see if they justify the rise in share prices. up to may 18, about 60% of the 96 companies listed on bursa malaysia that have announced their results have seen better earnings compared with the corresponding quarter a year ago. about 37% saw a decline while the remaining 3% showed a flat performance. according to bloomberg data, almost 50% of the companies that are covered by research houses have outperformed expectations. the first-quarter earnings will have a big impact on the sustainability of the share price rally. the results are almost certainly better than what we had seen last year. the big problem is that a lot of these recoveries have been priced in. the run-up has been so sharp this year. what im more concerned about is if the earnings fail to live up to the high expectations of the market, says pong teng siew, head of research at inter-pacific research sdn bhd. according to him, earnings are still on firm ground  especially in the first quarter  but investors will now be looking for signs of sustainable growth beyond the quarters results. etiqa insurance & takaful head of research chris eng agrees, saying that earnings have been on track and within expectations so far. however, the market has moved ahead of earnings for some of the companies, he points out. ever since the fbm klci breached the 1,770 level, we have not been as bullish about the market and believe that investors should gradually take profit as we expect to see some weakness. nonetheless, with the results showing positive outlook, it (fbm klci) could still head towards the 1,800 level u2026 theres nothing wrong with the local market and the market sentiment. the concern is more on the global market, says eng. some of the external factors that he mentions are the investigation into us president donald trumps ties to russia, and the geou00adpolitical tension involving north korea. the stock market appears to have hit a bumpy road as fears of more trouble ahead for the trump presidency spread across global markets. the fbm klci has fallen for three consecutive days up to last thursday  something that has only happened three times this year before the latest decline. a fund manager with a local asset management company, however, brushed off the decline as a temporary blip and insists that stronger earnings will keep the market momentum moving into the second half of 2017.  construction: 2016 contracts translate into better earnings jeremy goh, an analyst with hong leong investment bank, says the construction sector in general will see strong earnings results for the quarter ended march 31. in general, if you look at the contracts that have been announced on bursa malaysia, 2016 saw a record high of rm56.4 billion [domestic contracts awarded to listed contractors] and usually, the impact on profit will come in a year later for a span of three years, says goh. he adds that the momentum for the market rally hinges on the performance of corporate earnings. the stock market will be a bit jittery if earnings disappoint but if it meets expectations, the momentum will continue. of course, investors would probably still be hopeful if the first-quarter earnings were not on track as they would probably take a wait-and-see approach. but whats certain is that the numbers for the first six months will be crucial to keep the momentum going, says goh. pong concurs but believes that certain companies will perform well in the second half. he highlights econpile holdings bhd as one of the construction companies that is positioned to benefit from the upcoming contracts to be awarded.  banking: proxy for economic growth public bank bhd was one of the first few banks to announce its first-quarter results for the financial year ending dec 31, 2017 (1qfy2017). net profit rose a marginal 1.5% to rm1.25 billion from rm1.23 billion a year ago. with the malaysian economy expected to improve moving into next year, the banking sector is likely to see better days ahead, says etiqas eng. in the first quarter of this year, the economy grew at its fastest pace in two years as gross domestic product rose 5.6%, according to bank negara malaysia. the banking sector is viewed as a support to economic growth. thus, the earnings releases of malayan banking bhd, cimb group holdings bhd, rhb bank bhd and hong leong bank bhd this week will be closely monitored. the bursa malaysia finance index has increased 13.6% year to date (up to may 18).  plantation: better 1q but weakness in 2h expected the plantation sector is also expected to see better earnings this week on a year-on-year basis. alan lim, an analyst at midf research, says the results could be weaker sequentially but better year on year, in tandem with the movement in crude palm oil prices. eng says, while the earnings results are likely to be better in the first quarter as well as the first half, analysts are expecting a weaker second half as a result of weaker cpo prices. on this basis, despite better earnings in the first quarter, most analysts feel that it is in line with expectations. the plantation players that will be announcing their results this week include kuala lumpur kepong bhd and sime darby bhd.  oil and gas: gradual recovery but volatile oil price a key risk an analyst with a local research house says the outlook for the oil and gas sector remains weak and he expects its earnings to remain flattish. the oil price is still volatile while the capital expenditure will take some time to come through. of course, we have seen a strong rally in some of the o&g counters but its mainly due to a sharp collapse in some of these companies in the last two years. currently, some of the shares are already back to their fair value and i wouldnt advocate chasing after them, he says. petronas dagangan bhd is one of the o&g companies that has announced its first-quarter results  it saw a 15.4% growth in net profit to rm253.2 million. most of the o&g companies that announced their results last week saw better earnings than the year before. raymond yap, of cimb research, says in a report that the 1qfy2017 results for petronas dagangan were within expectations but a downward surprise was seen in the decline of sales volume by 4% year on year.  consumer: weak consumer sentiment persists after rallying in the last two years, the consumer sector is not looking too bright as sentiment remains weak, according to an analyst from ta securities. she says a lot of consumer players have had to raise prices due to the rising cost of commodities. with the pressure from rising inflation as well as the weaker ringgit, this has led to weak consumer sentiment. earnings are expected to be weaker or remain flattish compared with the previous years results. [with factors such as] the ringgit remaining low  the house view is at rm4.25 against the us dollar  and rising price of raw materials such as sugar due to the rationalisation of government subsidies, consumer sentiment is expected to remain weak, she explains. however, the analyst says sentiment could improve if an early general election were to translate into more goodies for the public. if that happens, consumer sentiment could improve and this would probably stimulate spending, she adds. there are other consumer players that are doing well, such as the poultry players and convenience stores, according to an analyst from a local research house.  logistics: long-term growth story logistics players are not likely to see excitement from their earnings announcements in the coming week, say analysts. quarter on quarter, we think that there will be a slight decline but overall, it should be flattish results for the logistics players. i think that for them, it will be more of a long-term growth story, driven by the e-commerce boom. but in the near term, were not going to see much excitement, says hong leong investment bank analyst lim sin kiat.

opinions are divided. veteran fund manager and investment guru dr tan chong koay believes that the rally in us equities after the american presidential election was due to positive sentiment on trumps pro-economic growth agenda. this includes promises of higher public spending on infrastructure and massive tax cuts for businesses. improved us economic data, for example, the march unemployment rate of 4.5%, a new post-crisis low, has only added to the buoyancy. as the dow jones industrial average is now at a historical high, the market will now focus on the delivery of trumps promises. a shortfall may lead to a market correction, he tells the edge. tan opines that the main risks to global and local equities, which investors should monitor closely, are the geopolitical developments in syria and north korea, the french presidential election on april 23, malaysias impending 14th general election as well as the ringgits volatility. we maintain our cautiously optimistic view and selectiveness in stock pricing. the corporate quarterly results reporting season in may will be the key driver of share prices. in general, investors should sell their shares if they feel they are overvalued, he advises. the founder, executive chairman and chief strategist of pheim asset management sdn bhd also reminds investors to not be fully invested at all times. we believe investors should trim their portfolios when the market is near the peak and increase equity exposure to nearly fully invested when there is a strong correction and the market is approaching its trough, he explains. he says retail investors who lack the capability or the time to analyse fundamental and technical factors should find fund managers with a positive long-term track record to manage their funds. midf research deputy head of research mohd redza abdul rahman concurs. investors shall always look at a companys fundamentals and compare them with those of its peers in the same industry. and if this information is too complicated for them, they should approach licensed investment advisers for guidance, he says. he adds that if managing a number of stocks is difficult for some, they should invest in unit trust funds where the investment decisions are made by professionals. there are gems among the mid caps and small caps but one has to also understand the companys prospects and how it has been performing. if the news is too good to be true, then probably it is. investors should make an informed decision based on data and facts, leaving emotions aside. redza points out that when the market is hot, investors tend to follow the herd and make uninformed investment decision, resulting in irrational exuberance in the market  when share prices are driven beyond their fundamentals despite the absence of positive corporate developments that warrant a drastic price rise. the growing confidence in the capital market will also coincide with the rise in unlicensed investment advisers offering tips to entice investors into flocking to certain counters and buying them at high prices. such action pushes the prices even higher, although there is no positive newsflow and catalysts to support the companies fundamentals. and when the prices fall, it is the layman who gets caught with significant paper losses, he warns. according to malaysia investors association president datin ho choy meng, a booming market provides institutional investors with a good opportunity to unload massive blocks of shares to realise the cash needed to pay their unitholders dividends. therefore, she says, retail investors should adopt a defensive and prudent strategy that emphasises capital protection, reasonable returns and asset growth. individual investors must be mindful of the volatility of global stock markets that is caused by fund managers constant moves to reap the most gains from the most promising bourses. hot money comes and goes as foreign fund managers make very fluid investment decisions; they do not show mercy, she cautions. ho also advises retail investors to know their limit and not commit more than what they can afford to lose. margin trading seems to give them multifold profits but once the market trends go into reverse, they will see all their hard-earned money wiped out. there will be blood on the trading floors, belonging to the many herd-instinct players who are vulnerable to adverse market forces. nevertheless, not everyone is sceptical about the recent bull run. etiqa insurance & takaful head of research chris eng poh yoon, who has been telling people to invest in stocks since august last year, is not surprised by the stock market rally as he had predicted that the economies of the us, europe and china would strengthen. the local market can still run if the us market moves higher. malaysia should outperform its regional peers if that happens. [now], selling by local funds has capped our rally, although the foreigners have returned to our market. so, there can be one more leg-up if the locals stop selling, he says. investors, however, should be wary of a may/june selldown due to global profit-taking, eng warns. hong leong investment bank bhd dealer representative frank lin is also of the view that the stock market rally is not overdone, considering that stocks such as genting bhd, malayan banking bhd and cimb group holdings bhd are not trading at all-time highs.

larger slice of the pie in the asean markets, as the automotive firm targets to export the locally assembled cx-5 to cambodia, indonesia and myanmar in the second half of this year. mazda japan is very bullish on asean, and they want to support us (mazda malaysia) to make malaysia an exporting hub, said bermaz auto executive director datuk francis lee kok chuan when met in singapore late last month. mazda malaysia, the local assembler of mazda vehicles in malaysia, is a 30:70 joint venture between bermaz auto and japanese car giant mazda motor corp (mazda japan). and next year, mazda malaysia hopes to export to one of the countries in the middle east. we are working with the malaysian government and are hoping to form some ftas (free trade agreements) at the g2g (government-to-government) level. otherwise, it will not be feasible with all the duties involved, he said. currently, lee said 50% of mazda malaysias sales come from the export market. he expects the portion to expand in future. more recently, back in kuala lumpur, he told the edge financial daily that mazda malaysia had invested over us$20 million in a new paint shop at inokom corp sdn bhds plant in kulim, kedah, last year, so that they can produce the latest mazda vehicle colours, and more importantly, to cater for the asean export markets. however, he declined to reveal any export target numbers. besides mazda vehicles, bermaz auto also distributes the brands spare parts in malaysia and the philippines. the group has a 29% stake in inokom, the contract manufacturer of various marques, including mazda vehicles. other shareholders of the consortium are sime darby motors sdn bhd (51%), hyundai motor co of south korea (15%) and sime darby hyundai sdn bhd (5%). lee said after the new paint shop is installed, production capacity at the inokom plant will be increased from 18,000 units to 35,000 units over two shifts. this, he said, should augur well for both mazda malaysia and inokom corp, which ultimately also benefits bermaz auto. with this increase in volume, mazda malaysia will try to export as many mazda vehicles as possible, by making malaysia the asean exporting hub, said lee. he also said the export sales figures will not be reflected in bermaz autos total vehicle sales, as mazda malaysia will be the one that exports mazda vehicles to other asean markets through its own distributors in their respective countries. the exports have nothing [directly] to do with us (bermaz auto). mazda malaysia will export [the cars] to their own national sales office in thailand, as well as their distributors in indonesia, cambodia and myanmar. these are the major export markets that they are looking at, lee clarified. of course, there will be earnings contributions to bermaz auto, because we also own [a] 30% stake in mazda malaysia, he said. vietnam is not included in mazda malaysias export plan as mazda japan operates a manufacturing plant there, said lee. the japanese automaker also owns a plant in thailand. bermaz autos car sales are mainly driven by the mazda 2 completely built-up (cbu) model imported from thailand, as well as the mazda 3 and cx-5, which are completely knocked-down (ckd) models assembled at inokoms plant in kulim. currently, the group has over 10 cbu models in its portfolio, but only two ckd models  namely mazda 3 and cx-5. bermaz auto changed its name from berjaya auto after a management buyout last year, as it is no longer a major subsidiary of berjaya corp bhd. bermaz auto has been recording lower car sales of late, in line with declining industry-wide volumes since the beginning of last year. the company, however, is unfazed by the situation. on the sidelines of maybank investment banks invest asean 2017 forum in singapore, lee said the groups strategy is to promote higher margin products, such as vehicles with typically higher selling prices. we dont want to push [lower-value cars], because the more [of those] cars we push, the more money we lose. so we only push those from which we can make money, he said. for the two months ended feb 28 this year, sales of mazda brand vehicles in malaysia fell 41% to 1,264 units from 2,136 units a year ago. over the entire 2016, mazda brand vehicles sales shrank 13% to 12,493 units from 14,325 units in 2015. bermaz auto recorded a 39% fall in net profit in its third quarter ended jan 31, 2017 to rm25.11 million from rm41.13 million in the same quarter a year ago. the earnings figure was the lowest bermaz auto charted since the companys public listing back in 2013. revenue was down 35% at rm338.68 million, versus rm522.58 million previously. despite the weaker financial performance, lee thinks bermaz auto is still outperforming some industry peers. we are still reporting profit, unlike other players. most of them are losing money because of the high depreciation of the ringgit, he said. lee also believes that bermaz autos prospects will improve in fy18, driven mainly by the introduction of mazdas new cx-5 and cx-9 models in malaysia by june this year. the supply of these models is already short globally, he noted. these are high margin products, especially the cx-9. mazda japan has given us some units to sell in malaysia, he said, adding that bermaz has an average gross profit margin of up to 15%. currently, lee said all 16 units of the cx-9 supplied by mazda japan for sale in malaysia have already been taken up by local buyers, prior to the june launch. so people are still buying big-ticket items. for those people at that kind of level of income, there is no such thing as reducing their expenditure. if it is the mass market, yes, i agree [consumer spending is lowering]. because [some of] these people live hand-to-mouth every day [so] they cant even consider buying a car. but the middle- to high-income earners, as long as they have steady jobs, they got nothing to worry about, he also said. lee also said bermaz auto is not going to provide any discounts for its products, regardless of the lower sales volume it has been seeing. in fact, the new cx-5 is going to be few thousand ringgit more expensive, because it is new. we dont want to give discounts like the others, because it will affect the resale value of existing customers cars. we need to keep our customers happy, even post sale. because at the end of the day, a happy customer will be the best product ambassador, he added. on the public listing of bermaz autos 60.4%-owned philippines mazda vehicle distributor, bermazauto philippines inc (bap), lee said management remains confident about completing the exercise by the first half of 2017. he estimated that out of the rm82.49 million proceeds to be raised through baps initial public offering, up to rm22 million would be repatriated to baps malaysian shareholders. we have to pay some fees after repatriating the money. so, hopefully, we can pay some dividends after deducting everything, he said. for the nine-months ended jan 31, 2017, bermaz auto declared a dividend payout of 8.5 sen per share, versus 6.9 sen in the previous corresponding period, although earnings per share fell to 8.45 sen from 12.84 sen. a quick check on bloomberg showed that seven research analysts who track bermaz auto have a buy call on it, while another five have given it a hold recommendation. with a consensus target price of rm2.21, they reckon the counter still has a 9.4% upside potential, from its closing of rm2.02 last friday. year to date, the stock has slipped 5.2%, giving it a market capitalisation of rm2.32 billion."}, "24": {"date_posted": "20/3/2017", "title": "indonesia falls after 5 sessions of gains; malaysia hits near 22-mth high", "article": " (march 20): southeast asian stock markets

about 8.5 times (below the industrys average of 9.3 times) and a strong balance sheet, the year ahead looks bright for magni-tech although inter-pacific research cautioned that upside might take some time to materialise. it has zero debt with a total cash holding of rm62.6 million and rm74.1 million invested in investment securities. with its dividend yield of about 3% expected to continue, its proven track record in the industry, excellent balance sheet, a stronger us dollar and an expected earnings growth riding on nike, magni-tech could just entice investors to give it a second thought for 2017 after being overlooked for most of 2016.  by billy toh  classic scenic bhd classic scenic bhd, the wooden picture frame manufacturer, is the classic dividend play for 2017 with its above market average dividend yield of about 7%, and might be the right defensive strategy amid the uncertain external environment. last year, its share price performance was impressive with a total return

has significant upside due to its strong outstanding order book of rm9 billion, supported by the mmc-gamuda joint venture which secured the rm15.5 billion mass rapid transit (mrt) line 2 underground works package in march 2016, according to ta securities. we expect close to rm500 million of project development partner (pdp) fee to flow directly to profit before tax throughout the implementation of [the] mrt line 2, the research house said in a report. other catalysts include gamudas works package for pan borneo highway worth rm1.57 billion and the appointment of srs consortium, in which

of rm40 billion, with works targeted to commence in 2018. the potential sale of gamudas 40% stake in the syarikat pengeluar air sungai selangor water supply concession should provide the funding for

improve market sentiment due to the legalisation of casino operations in japan. research houses have pointed to expected higher visitor growth as the main catalyst for the stock in light of the full launch of the first phase of the gitp by end-2017, which includes the opening of the 20th century fox theme park. the consensus 12-month target price for genting malaysia is rm5.13 based on estimates

holdings bhd is set to benefit from the improved demand for timber as well as the turnaround in the plantation sector. the company has been chosen by kenanga research, affinhwang capital and public investment bank research as their stock picks for 2017 in their latest strategy reports. kaf investment bank chief investment officer gan kong yik likes ta ann as he is upbeat about the plantation sector in 2017 with crude palm oil (cpo) price expected to be firmer. furthermore, the demand for timber is anticipated to increase in 2017. another plus point for ta ann is that it is seen as a beneficiary from the stronger us dollar. in a strategy note dated jan 4, kenanga research expects ta ann to be a double beneficiary of the sharp cpo price appreciation, as well as stronger us dollar as the company exports nearly all of its timber products, and sales are denominated in us dollars while costs are entirely in ringgit terms. it also likes ta ann for its sector-leading dividend yield of 3.8% against the average 2.4%. the consensus 12-month target price for ta ann is at rm4.38. six out of nine research houses covering the stock have given it a buy call. the integrated timber

(o&g) services provider sapurakencana petroleum bhd is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the oil production cut pledge between opec and non-opec members. the deal is expected to start a cyclical recovery for the o&g sector and sapurakencana is viewed as a good proxy to ride on the gradual recovery of the sector. several research houses have upgraded their call on the o&g sector recently, after opec and non-opec members pledged to cut production. chosen as one of the stock picks for 2017 by public investment bank research, the research house said the worst is likely behind for sapurakencana. given its ability to undertake comprehensive scope of works across the o&g suite, sapurakencana is said to stand in a better position against its peers on expected recovery in o&g activities. maybank ib research has pointed out that sapurakencana is a proxy to a rising oil price play and monetising its gas assets is a major catalyst. the counter is one of its key buys in the sector. kenanga research has recently upgraded sapurakencana to an outperform call with a target price of rm1.88, following the rerating on the selective upstream players in view of the sustainability of oil prices above us$50 (rm236) per barrel. bloomberg data shows that there are five research houses with a buy call on the stock, and 12 with a hold call. recall that the counter fell by nearly 20% in 2016 and has plummeted by almost 63% in the last three years.  by yimie yong  bumi armada bhd bumi armada bhd, which saw its share price fall more than 40%, may provide another opportunity for investors in anticipation of improving sentiment and operating outlook of the oil and gas sector. ta investment management bhd executive director choo swee kee pointed out that bumi armada shares were oversold in the past two years and expected there would be strong earnings growth for its floating production storage and offloading (fpso) business. bumi armada is one of our top picks for 2017. moving forward, we think there will be stronger earnings growth for the fpso. we also like earnings generated from the fpso as they are seen as more stable, he told the edge financial daily. bumi armada is one of the worlds largest fpso players. public investment bank, which has a buy call on the counter, expects to see a boost in earnings from four major fpso & floating gas solutions (fgs) contributions in 2017, according to its note dated nov 24, 2016. bumi armada posted a net loss of rm96.71 milion in the third quarter ended sept 30, 2016 (3qfy16) versus a net profit of rm70 million a year earlier, on lower revenue. revenue fell 33% to rm377.51 million in 3qfy16 from rm559.46 million in 3qfy15, as it saw lower income from fgs and fpso operations. despite weaker earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) level, uob kay hian said it had assessed that there was no cause for concern as bumi armada was still well within the allowable range for loan covenant on net debt/ebitda.  by yimie yong  protasco bhd protasco bhd is one of the construction players that are expected to benefit from an early general election in 2017. the well-established player in the construction industry is focused on road maintenance works, where most of them are based on concessions awarded by state and federal governments, providing the company with a steady income stream. with the heightened expectation of the 14th general election happening in 2017, there is a potential for extra emergency road maintenance works to be carried out, according to kenanga research. protasco has an outstanding order book of about rm4.4 billion for its maintenance concessions, which could last for about 10 years, contributing about rm400 million to its revenue yearly. looking forward, protasco is eyeing more sizeable concessions, which could potentially contribute another rm100 million to rm200 million to its top-line. for its construction division, management is targeting a replenishment of about rm500 million for the financial year ending dec 31, 2017 that comprises infrastructure and government housing projects such as perumahan penjawat awam 1malaysia

dividend yield of about 5.6%, far superior in comparison with other small- to mid-cap construction players with an average of 2.9%.  by billy toh"}, "30": {"date_posted": "8/12/2016", "title": "bauto

rm55.02 million or 3.87 sen a share in the third quarter ended sept 30, 2016 (3qfy16) from rm37.97 million or 2.67 sen a share a year ago, as prizes payout for its gaming segment was lower in the current quarter. revenue, however, fell 2% to rm647.19 million in 3qfy16 from rm660.17 million in 3qfy15, on lower gaming sales as a result of intense competition from illegal operators and the weakness in consumer spending. the gaming company declared a third interim dividend of 3 sen per share for the financial year ending dec 31, 2016 (fy16), payable on dec 28. this brings total dividends for the year to 10 sen per share. for the cumulative nine months (9mfy16), its net profit dropped 22.7% to rm145.7 million from rm188.56 million a year ago, mainly due to lower profits from the gaming

ago, due to loss incurred in its americas segment. its revenue also fell 10.37% to rm410.65 million from rm458.18 million a year ago. the company said its americas segment recorded a loss during the period, mainly attributable to low orders secured as a result of uncertainties in oil sand development in north america as well as high project overheads. in addition, it said the group recorded a lower profit before tax for the period due to recognition of a one-off gain from disposal of its australian operations in the corresponding period last year. for the cumulative nine-month period

2016 (3qfy16) from rm5.91 million or 1.35 sen per share in the corresponding quarter last year. the group said its construction division was the main driver of profit growth for the quarter, partly offset by losses in the property development division amid the soft property market. \"the losses incurred were mainly due to the competitive pricing in the property market as well as higher operating and financing expenses after the opening of the evolve mall,\" said jaks. revenue for the quarter increased 83% to rm209.12 million from rm114.15 million a year earlier. \"the current quarter's revenue was contributed mainly by the construction division of rm154.7 million, of which rm94.3 million was derived from the vietnam epc construction revenue. \"the property development division contributed rm43.1 million to the group's revenue following the progress billings achieved. the trading and manufacturing divisions generated revenue of rm11.3 million in the quarter under review,\"

biggest lender malayan banking bhd (maybank) said on thursday it had cut its loan growth projection for the current financial year, after posting a drop in third-quarter profit hurt by a higher tax charge. net profit for july-september was rm1.795 billion (us$402.9 million), 5.4% lower than rm1.898 billion a year earlier. the lender's fourth straight quarterly drop in profit comes amid slowing loan growth at home and exposure to the oil and gas industry that has been hit by falling prices. the group lowered the full-year estimate for loan growth to 2u20133% and cut the forecast for return on equity to 10.5u201311% due to \"selective asset growth\". \"we are mindful of potential asset quality weakness in a slowing economic growth environment in some of our key operating markets,\" maybank said in a statement. \"as the group has proactively restructured and rescheduled borrowers' facilities in 1hfy16, the group continues to monitor the impaired status of these loans with the intention of recognising some recoveries in 2hfy16,\" the bank said. it added that it seeks to maintain strong capital levels, well above regulatory requirements. axiata group bhd reported a 71% fall in its third quarter net profit at rm256.56 million from rm891.39 million a year earlier, on higher operating cost. weaker financials from its malaysia and indonesia units also contributed to the group's lower net profit. mobile-telecommunication network provider axiata said revenue, however, rose to rm5.46 billion in the third quarter ended sept 30, 2016 (3qfy16) from rm5.06 billion. axiata said operating cost rose 5.1% to rm3.37 billion from rm3.2 billion. \"group revenue increased by 7.7% to rm5.46 billion in the current quarter from rm5.07 billion recorded in [the] third quarter of 2015, primarily due to contribution of revenue from nepal in 3qfy16 and higher revenues in sri lanka, bangladesh and cambodia, coupled with a positive translation impact. \"contribution of nepal as well as higher profits recorded by sri lanka, bangladesh and cambodia had a positive impact on pat (profit after tax), which was partly offset by operations in malaysia and indonesia that registered lower profits due to intense competition in respective markets and foreign currency fluctuation,\" axiata said. cumulative 9mfy16 net profit fell to rm813.75 million from rm2.09 billion a year earlier. revenue was, however, higher at rm15.78 billion versus rm14.52 billion. palette multimedia bhd plans to diversify into traditional chinese medicine (tcm) to expand its earnings base. palette

as the divergence between their share prices widened. this scenario was last seen during the 2008/09 global financial crisis. this growing difference between public bank and maybank started 10 years ago, before gfc, when investors became more concerned about the asset quality of banks amid an economic downturn. from april 2008 to april 2009, the market cap of public bank exceeded that of maybank on and off. as at last friday, public bank was still winning  by a nose. its share price closed at rm19.82, giving it a market cap of rm76.54 billion, which surpassed the rm75.07 billion market cap of maybank, whose share price closed at rm7.50. where banks are concerned, one of the key issues for investors is asset quality in a weak economic environment. public bank has stood out with its ability to maintain its solid asset quality and report earnings growth despite a challenging business climate for banks, uob asset management ltd executive director and ceo lim suet ling tells the edge in an email. questions were raised about the asset quality of the local banking industry recently after singapores oilfield service provider swiber holdings ltd filed for liquidation, and it was reported that maybank had a loan exposure of about rm5.1 billion, or 1.2% of its total loans, to the oil and gas as well as related sectors in singapore. lim notes that public banks premium valuation can also be justified by its superior profitability ratios. for example, its return on equity (roe) of 17.51% is among the highest in the industry. by comparison, maybanks roe is 10.63%. public banks profit growth may be marginal but its exposure to the o&g sector is less than maybanks, observes phillip capital management sdn bhd chief investment officer ang kok heng. he says public bank is technically stronger than maybank because investors have more confidence in it, although the latters valuation and price-earnings ratio (per) are more attractive and dividend yield is higher. maybank, the countrys biggest bank, is trading at 1.2 times price-to-book value (pbv)  below its five-year historical average of 1.7 times  while public bank is trading at 2.36 times. maybank is also trading at a more favourable per of 11.82 times compared with public banks 14.79 times while its dividend yield has risen to 6.67% while public banks has dropped to 2.93% because of a rally in its shares since the beginning of the year. nonetheless, these ratios are not the key determinants for investors looking for certainty and earnings visibility. a fund manager with a foreign fund house says loan growth and net interest margin are more important factors than, say, dividend yield. you dont want to buy a stock with only yield but no growth because, eventually, if the banks business cannot grow, earnings will come down and yield will be affected as well, he tells the edge over the phone. in the first half ended june 30, 2016, maybanks net profit fell 21.26% to rm2.59 billion, although its revenue grew 22% to rm22.12 billion. the earnings contraction was due to higher provisions for impairment losses on loans, advances, financing and other debts, overhead expenses and other lower operating income. conversely, public bank managed to grow its net profit  albeit a marginal 4.97% to rm2.49 billion on revenue of rm10 billion  in an increasingly competitive operating environment. it said the groups profit growth was driven by continued healthy loan growth and sustained strong asset quality. in the present gloomy business climate, fund managers have their reservations about maybank at its current share price level. public bank has shown its ability to deliver above-industry profitability while maintaining its strong asset quality. we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future, says uobs lim. all said and done, given public banks firm fundamentals, many may hold on to the stock but few may buy it at its current valuation. as maybanks recent share price performance was hampered by its disclosure of increased provisions, especially for the energy sector, she opines that investors will need to see a stabilisation or improvement in asset quality before viewing it positively. uob kay hian research analyst keith wee has a target price of rm7.90 for maybank (5% upside from current levels) and rm22 for public bank (11% upside from current levels). he derived public banks target price from an roe of 14.8% and fy2017 pbv of 2.4 times. he opines that public banks valuation premium is sustainable because of its robust asset quality, above-industry loan growth and good position to transition into ifrs9, an international financial reporting standard promulgated by the international accounting standards board. according to him, maybanks regulatory reserves only account for 10% of total current provisions on its balance sheet compared with public banks 125%. there could be some short-term election play on maybank but the banking groups provisions will remain elevated for the rest of the year. this is because asset quality may have yet to bottom out and the group will need to build up its regulatory reserve buffers ahead of ifrs9 implementation, he says. although maybanks share price has come off its peak, wee does not view it as a good bargain yet. it is fairly valued at an roe of 9% and pbv of 1.15 times. this may also explain why fund managers such as pheim asset management chief investment officer james lau and areca capital sdn bhd ceo danny wong prefer to wait for a lower valuation before buying maybank. they believe its valuation has yet to be fully priced for reversal in the credit cycle. other analysts, however, see more value in maybank, especially as the counter has fallen below the target price of most research houses and there is a likelihood of a potential write-back for the bank. maybanks shares have fallen 18% from a peak of rm9.20 in april. a provision for oil and gas does not mean a loan default. we may see a potential write-back in the coming quarters if the oil and gas sector stabilises, kenanga research analyst ahmad ramzani tells the edge. m&a securities analyst azizi khairudin also points out that maybanks exposure to underperforming sectors such as o&g is only 4% of its restructuring and rescheduling (r&r) account. he reckons that once maybank restructures its r&r account, things will get better. midf researchs banking analyst concurs, and sees upside potential for maybank share price. at its current level, it might be a good idea to accumulate the stock. the expected dividend yield of 7.5%, among the highest in the industry, would limit any downside risk, he says.

cimb group holdings bhd is in talks with foreign financial institutions to potentially form partnerships for its securities business. the working relationship options it is exploring include selling part of the groups stake in the securities business, sources say. investment bankers have arranged meetings between cimb and foreign financial institutions to discuss potential partnerships. some partnership scenarios include the local banking group disposing of some stake in one, or a few, of its securities businesses, says a source familiar with the matter. another source notes that the talks are still preliminary. yes, there are talks, but it is still early days. each party wants to ensure that it is a positive deal for them in the challenging landscape today ... so, it is taking some time, says a banker familiar with the matter. cimb wants a partnership structure that can help it improve its cost-to-income ratio, but at the same time does not involve another round of job cuts. from what we understand, cimb wants to avoid the job-cutting route, if possible, he says. cimb declined to comment when contacted by the edge. cimbs management met with analysts last week and one of the things it guided was that any future rationalisation will focus on its operations outside asean. it is interesting to note that the groups businesses outside asean are mainly in the securities segment. other areas being reviewed would be operations outside asean (the group also has businesses in taiwan, south korea and india) as well as support functions for countries outside asean, which are based in singapore, notes maybank investment bank research in a jan 20 report. cimbs foreign securities business is parked in singapore under cimb securities international, which serves institutional clients in asia-pacific as well as global investors in the regions equity markets. cimb securities international was formerly known as g k goh stockbrokers pte ltd. cimb acquired the foreign stockbroking and investment banking businesses from the g k goh group in 2005. the s$239 million acquisition  its biggest foreign acquisition at the time  gave cimb a platform in singapore as well as other overseas markets such as indonesia, hong kong, the uk and the us. in 2012, cimb group acquired most of the asia-pacific cash equities and associated investment banking businesses of the royal bank of scotland (rbs) in a deal valued at over rm800 million. the rbs purchase transformed cimb into an asia-pacific investment banking player, but raised questions as to whether the local banking group had overstretched itself. cimbs earnings have suffered recently and today, it has one of the lowest common equity tier 1 (cet1) ratios in the industry. in a jan 21 research report, maybank ib research says that while the debate rages as to whether cimb, with its fully loaded cet1 ratio of 9.1%, needs to raise capital, management maintains that the group does not need to do so. it adds that cimb will continue to focus on improving risk weights while expediting non-core asset sales to take its capital ratios up. as at sept 30, 2015, cimb groups total capital ratio stood at 13.4%, while its cet1 capital ratio was 9.3%. in a move to consolidate and manage its ballooning costs, the countrys second largest banking group slashed jobs substantially last year and closed its offices in sydney and melbourne, australia. in its results note for the nine months ended sept 30, 2015, cimb says its business-as-usual cost-to-income ratio improved to 56.2%, from 57.8% a year earlier, as its cost management initiatives begin to show traction. the banking group targets to achieve a cost-to-income ratio of below 50% by end-2018. hong leong investment bank research says that for 2015, cimbs management told analysts that it was keeping to its cost-to-income ratio for 2015 at 55%. for 2016, management hinted that it should not deviate significantly from 2015, as it is looking to contain cost growth of 3% to 4%, it adds in a jan 21 report. last year, cimb cut about 150 jobs outside malaysia and indonesia. it also undertook a mutual separation scheme (mss) for its malaysian and indonesian businesses, under which 3,599 applications (1,891 from malaysia and 1,708 from indonesia) were approved. cimb group ceo tengku datuk seri zafrul aziz told reporters early last week that the group is not planning any more mss in malaysia and indonesia. the focus this year will be on improving our productivity and continuing our t18 [target 2018] agenda. in short, there will be no more mss or retrenchment, he said. the banking group recently retrenched 32 employees at its hong kong investment banking and equities operations. zafrul said the groups decision to let go of staff in hong kong was due to tough capital market conditions across asia, especially in hong kong. the operating landscape has been tough and the turbulence is expected to continue this year amid economic uncertainties. cimbs share price dipped below rm4 last week, to a five-year low of rm3.94 last thursday. indeed, the banks share price has been on a slippery slope since mid-2013, falling from rm8.50. the banking groups fourth-quarter results, which will be released next month, will be closely watched. cimb group saw its net profit fall 30% year on year to rm2.06 billion for its nine months ended sept 30, 2015. the bottom line was hit by the huge provisions it had to make for its indonesian business, which has been saddled with bad loans due to a weakening economic environment. the allowances made for impairment losses on loans, advances and financing more than doubled to rm1.59 billion in september 2015. hong leong investment bank research notes that although cimbs provisions in indonesia will likely remain elevated in 2016, they will come in lower than in 2015, with the weakness confined to the commodity segment. for malaysia, management expects a slight deterioration in asset quality (particularly within the retail segment) given the economic sentiment and limited room for further improvement (as impaired loans and provisions are already at low levels), the note adds. the 12-month consensus price for the stock among analysts polled on bloomberg is rm4.76 with seven calling buy, six a sell and 11 a hold."}, "36": {"date_posted": "6/1/2016",

latest financial sector statistics from bank negara malaysia (bnm) may see investors maintaining a pessimistic view of the banking industry but not all are shying away from investing in them. malayan banking bhd (maybank) and rhb capital bhd (rhbcap) have emerged as the top picks due to their attractive valuations and earnings growth prospects. the central bank data showed malaysian banks loan portfolio growing by 8.4% year-on-year (y-o-y) in november, the third straight month of slowing growth (october: 9.1%; september: 8.4%). novembers loan application declined by 5.4%, while the approval rate fell at a bigger clip of 11%. in fact, the sector has been in the doldrums over the last few years, notably since the responsible lending guidelines and tighter mortgage lending criteria were implemented. non-performing loans have been inching higher while deposit-taking activities slowed. in dealing with net interest margin compression, banks have undertaken various measures to cut cost, including letting staff go. nevertheless, some fund managers and analysts have turned positive on maybank and rhbcap. with valuecap [sdn bhd] eventually entering the market, it would be enough to support the stocks deemed to be undervalued, areca capital sdn bhd chief executive officer danny wong teck meng told the edge financial daily. armed with rm20 billion, valuecap has been mandated by the government to invest in undervalued malaysian stocks to lend confidence to the local market. it was supposed to begin investing the first tranche of funds worth rm6 billion by the end of november 2015, but funding issues with one of its three shareholders had delayed the plan. wong, who manages about rm700 million of assets, said he favours maybank due to its dividend yield. midf research senior analyst kelvin ong echoed this view in a note on monday, saying maybanks yield is attractive and that malaysias largest bank by asset size has diversified earnings  giving it the only buy call among all banks under midfs coverage. bloomberg data showed 13 out of 23 analysts have buy recommendations on maybank. with an average target price of rm9.07  derived from a range of rm5.50 to rm11.20  it implied an 8.88% upside to yesterdays closing. analysts have projected total dividend per share (dps) of 64 sen from maybank for its financial year ending dec 31, 2016 (fy16), unchanged from fy15. with that, the stock would yield 7.68% from yesterdays price. dps for rhbcap is estimated at 22.19 sen a share, giving it a yield of 3.96%. but analysts and fund managers are optimistic on the banks growth prospects, with the proposition becoming sweeter because rhbcap is trading at 29.6% below its book value. cimb investment bank (ib) is one of the eight research outfits recommending investors to accumulate rhbcap and said last october that the bank is worth investing in for up to five years. cimb ib has a target price of rm8.50 for rhbcap, the highest among the 19 analysts tracking the bank. bloomberg data showed rhbcap has an average target price of rm6.24. despite the disappointing third quarter of fy15 ended sept 30, 2015 results, rhbcap remains an add and our top pick of the sector as we envisage stronger earnings per share (eps) growth in fy16, said cimb senior analyst winson ng in a nov 30, 2015 note. he projected rhbcaps core eps to grow by 22% y-o-y to 72 sen in fy16, from 59 sen. he said catalysts for the stock would be benefits rhbcap reaps from implementing its three-year transformation programme ignite 2017, costs saved from downsizing headcount via its career transformation programme, and the drive for regional expansion in the longer term. maybank added 13 sen or 1.59% to close at rm8.33 yesterday, while rhbcap gained three sen or 0.54% to close at rm5.60. but merely investing in banks trading below their respective historical book values would not be a good idea, eastspring investments bhd general manager of investment services yvonne tan told the edge financial daily. instead, she said she would look at whether a bank has been generating returns on equity (roe) that are in line with their historical averages. if they dont, eventually their book values will deteriorate anyway, she added. usually, we would value banks with low roes at a discount to their book values, and a premium when they have high roes. apart from rhbcap, three other stocks are trading below their current book values. they are cimb group holdings bhd (at a 5.56% discount to its latest reported book value per share), ammb holdings bhd (10.61%) and affin holdings bhd (44.71%). but in general, tan said she does not favour the sector for now. these are premised on four reasons: business environment is very challenging, demand in the property market is still soft, continued softening of consumer sentiment, and rising credit costs. kenanga investment bank in a note on banks on monday put the forward roe for malaysian banks at 12.8%, with all aforementioned banks being below the average. those with roes above 12.8% are public bank bhd, hong leong bank bhd and bimb holdings bhd. affin, meanwhile, has the lowest, at 7%, and the only one with a single-digit return. of course, with softer economic conditions and tighter lending criteria by bnm, banks are no longer enjoying roes like in the early 2010s. but bloomberg data showed rhbcap and cimbs average estimated roe in their financial years ending dec 31, 2016 (fy16) to grow by at least 41 basis points. there will be headwinds in the short term. but we project earnings growth for some of these banks by the end of the year. when prices are weak, thats the time to accumulate stocks, said areca capitals wong. but he said cimb still carried a risk as it has regional presence. with economic conditions softening in the region, investors might not be too favourable towards cimb."}, "38": {"date_posted": "9/12/2015", "title": "chhb, eg industries, sanichi, sp setia, kps, mikro msc, pucf, scgm and

investments", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on november 23 - 29, 2015.  as at last friday, there was no indication if aabar investments pjs had sold any of its 21.09% stake in rhb capital bhd ahead of the nov 23 book closure of the banking groups rights issue, sources say. some analysts and industry observers had expected aabar to sell some of its holding in rhb before the shares traded ex-rights on nov 19. any party buying the shares on or after that date would not be entitled to the rights offering. it doesnt look like aabar has sold any of its shares [as at end-friday] but we cant be 100% sure that it did not. based on volume monitoring, there were no large blocks crossed, but then again, aabar may have sold shares in small volumes over several transactions. it could have also sold shares off market. one can only know for sure on nov 23 [which is the last day of lodgement], says a source familiar with the matter. whats clear is that if aabar did sell some shares, the trades were not facilitated by the rhb group as in previous times, market sources tell the edge. as at last friday, there were no filings with bursa malaysia to indicate any substantial shareholding change in rhb. according to sources, rhb is expected to distribute an abridged prospectus to shareholders on nov 25 while the date of acceptance and payment for the rights issue is dec 8. the rights shares are expected to be listed on dec 21. rhb had in september said it was extending the subscription period for its rights issue by nearly two months after being informed by bank negara malaysia that aabar can subscribe for no more than 15% of the rights issue despite its higher shareholding. under the initial plan, the exercise was to have been completed by end-october. aabars stake will drop slightly to 20.29% from 21.09% with its rights entitlement capped at 15%. this is why there was an expectation that aabar might selldown its holdings beforehand, says a banking analyst. one of the sources says aabars position on whether it will subscribe for the rights issue is still unclear. its very hard to read their decision as they are not communicative. if they still h old 21.09%, then the most probable scenario is that the rights issue will be downsized [to exclude the 6.09% portion that aabar is not allowed] to raise about rm2.35 billion instead of rm2.5 billion as originally planned. this is all right as rhb doesnt need to raise so much anyway. the proceeds are mainly for recapitalisation and to pare down existing borrowings. rhb has announced it will downsize the rights issue in accordance with aabars stake at the entitlement date. dbs group research, in a nov 19 note to clients, points out: excess rights shares, which were supposedly entitled to aabar (31.5 million), will be knocked off the entire rights issue size, reducing the number of rights shares to 486 million (from 518 million). rhbs enlarged share base post-rights issue would be 3,075 million (instead of 3,106 million) while the rights issue proceeds would be rm2,343 million (instead of rm2,495 million). this, however, would mean that post-rights issue, the stakes of other rhb shareholders will increase. osk holdings bhds stake would rise to 10.07% from 9.97% while the employees provident funds would increase to 41.93% from 41.49%. rhb has pointed out that under the financial services act 2013, osk will require bank negaras approval as its post-rights stake exceeds a multiple of 5%. osk had on oct 21 submitted an application to the central bank to seek its approval and the decision is pending. however, should it not get bank negaras approval, rhb says underwriters are on standby to take up an additional 2.3 million shares to reduce osks post-rights stake to 9.99% from 10.07%. positively, the downsizing of the rights issue reduces the risk of a share overhang from the 6% that aabar is not entitled to. however, this also means that rhb could forego about rm152 million of proceeds and raise rm2.34 billion instead of rm2.5 billion, maybank investment bank reserach says in a nov 19 report. the revelation about the 15% cap on aabar came on sept 17. the central bank, in a letter to rhb on sept 14, said it required rhb to give effect to the order prohibiting aabar from exercising its voting rights in respect of the shares held in rhb in excess of 15%. it also said rhb is prohibited from issuing any further shares to aabar in excess of a 15% shareholding, thus limiting aabars entitlement to the rights issue to not more than 15% of the issue. the shareholding condition imposed by bank negara on aabar is in respect to the initial approval granted by the finance minister for aabar to acquire a 24.9% stake in rhbcap, rhb said in the stock exchange filing. the wording of the announcements suggests that this was already a precondition in the original agreement with aabar, says maybank ib research in a sept 18 report. investors will recall that aabar acquired its original 24.9% stake in rhb from its sister company abu dhabi commercial bank (adcb) back in june 2011 for rm10.80 a share. unlike adcb, which is a bank, aabar is a company and back then, bafia restricted corporate shareholding in banks to no more than 20% (the current financial services act, which superseded bafia in june 2013, is silent on this). thus, it is our assumption that it may have been a prerequisite for aabar to pare down its shareholding within a specific time frame, which could have been five years, since aabar has just entered into its fifth year as a shareholder of rhb, maybank ib says. should the middle eastern investor decide not to take up the rights issue, its shareholding in rhb would drop to 17.5%. reuters reported in september

reclamation of stp2 from 740 acres, as provided by the concession agreement, to 760 acres. as at 4pm, e&o was traded unchanged at rm1.50, with market capitalisation of rm1.88 billion.

after us federal reserve chairman janet yellen is expected to raise interest rates in mid-december, though at a slow and gradual pace. energy stocks led market declines ahead of the coming

down 2.85 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks such as astro malaysia holdings bhd, genting bhd, malayan banking bhd, petronas chemicals group bhd and sapurakencana petroleum bhd caused the index to inch down on minor profit-taking activities. the ringgit was weaker against the us dollar at 4.2225 as brent crude oil turned softer to us$42.20 per barrel. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014), and this represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,837.28 (low), 1,879.62 (high), 1,766.22 (low), 1,858.09 (high), 1,671.82 (low), 1,810.21 (high), 1,706.18 (low), 1,831.41 (high), 1,774.30 (low),

and macd indicators showing obvious buy signals. its stochastic and oscillator remain only marginally negative for now. as such, the indexs obvious support levels are seen at 1,595, 1,644 and 1,671, while heavy profit-taking at the resistance areas of 1,673, 1,727 and 1,744 may cap any index advances. the fbm klcis 18-day and 40-day simple moving averages (sma) depict a neutral trend for its short-term daily chart. the indexs price bars are now between the 50-day and 200-day sma, and this depicts a neutral phase for the fbm klci in the medium term too. due to the uncertain tone for the fbm klci index, we are recommending a chart sell on wah seong corp bhd. a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that 10 research houses cover this stock. there are three buy calls, two neutral calls and five sell calls. maybank investment bank bhd (maybank ib) has a sell call on the stock, with a target price (tp) of 60 sen. maybank ibs analyst maintained his sell call with a lowered tp of 60 sen. its recent results missed estimates and its reported core net loss of rm9 million in the third quarter 2015 (3qfy15) lowered nine-month 2015 (9mfy15) core earnings to rm33 million. the disappointment in 3qfy15 was due to slowdown of workflows especially for its oil and gas operations. wah seong faces a tough 24 months ahead as its order book is depleting and has dipped below the rm1 billion mark for the first time since 2012. wah seongs chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly down. its share price made an obvious plunge since its major weekly wave-5 high of rm1.99 in may 2014. since that rm1.99 high, wah seong fell to its recent december 2015 low of rm1. as prices broke above its recent key critical support levels of rm1.43 and rm1.69, look to sell wah seong on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term downtrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the

bunch (ffb) production due to the current el-nino effect and the ongoing haze that has blanketed the region, but said this would provide support for crude palm oil (cpo) prices. \"we are now entering seasonal low production period,\" said ioi corp chief executive officer datuk lee yeow chor, adding the el-nino effect and haze has further weighed down the production as the fewer hours of sunlight reduce photosynthesis. this has prompted the group to lower its full year ffb production growth forecast to 3%u20135% from 5%u20137% previously. \"but i do not see negative impact to our profitability. there is a good chance (for cpo prices) to go up, when the inventory is declining,\" he said. \"cpo prices are likely to stabilise at the current level until the end of the year and have the potential to rise further in the first quarter of next year,\" he told reporters after ioi corp's annual general meeting and extraordinary general meeting today. but he declined to specify a specific price range target. as at 12.30pm midday break, fcpo for january delivery was traded up rm14 at rm2,293 per tonne. on the new minimum wage scheme that will come into force in next july, lee said it has minimal impact on the group as all of its workers are earning above the range, including allowances and incentives. elaborating further, he said that stripping off the allowances and incentives, some 15% to 20% of its total plantation work force (25,000 workers) were earning around the minimum wage. \"currently, we provide free housing and utilities to all workers and we have to cover foreign workers' medical expenses starting next year. \"we are bearing all types of cost presently. this has eroded the competitiveness of the plantation players,\" he added. on a back of envelope calculation, assuming the increment was rm100 per worker, ioi corp may have to fork out an additional rm4.5 million to rm6 million for workers' remuneration yearly. the weakening ringgit did not bode well for ioi corp as its total net debt stood at rm4.7 billion, while its gross debt was rm6 billion as at june 30, 2015, of which 90% is us dollar denominated. should the ringgit depreciate further, ioi corp may face further pressure on translation loss. lee, however, commented that the debt would not affect the group's cash at the moment as 50% of the debt will only be matured beyond 2022. \"we can only see the exact impact in financial year 2017 as the repayment will come in during the financial year,\" he said. the weaker ringgit will also put pressure on its cost structure, lee said, adding that every 20% rise in the us dollar against the ringgit will translate into a 3% rise in fertiliser cost. he added fertiliser cost made up 15% to 20% of the total cost of the group. \"currently, our cost of production stood at rm1,400 per metric tonne and the fertiliser cost for the next three months has also been locked in,\" he pointed out. on its earnings, lee said the outlook for the group remained positive and its downstream activities has hit its expectation. \"our oleo chemical segment has performed well in the last five to six months due to the low palm kernel oil prices,\" he said. \"i am not sure how our results would be, but as i mentioned earlier, we expect cpo prices to go up it is good for the company,\" he added. in a report last month, maybank investment bank research estimated ioi corp may sink into red in 1qfy16 with a possible net loss of rm440 million due to an estimated rm670 million unrealised forex translation losses on its us dollar debt related exposure of rm6.25 billion following a 16.5% decline in the ringgit to 4.395 against the us dollar during 3qcy15. it said operationally, it expects ioi corp to post flattish on-year 1qfy16 core net profit of rm230 million. on whether ioi corp can regain its shariah-compliant status, lee said the group has converted its non-islamic debt to islamic debt, which caused its conventional debt to fall below the 30% requirement. \"we have satisfied the requirement but we are not too sure ... they (the authority) may have other criteria,\" he added. on the proposed trans-pacific partnership agreement (tppa), lee said the free trade agreement is positive to plantation players. \"the us is the main market for cpo products. with tppa, the import tariff on certain palm oil products will be removed. i think this is positive to the exports,\" he said.

2015, up from the current rm6.6 billion. in a presentation earlier, maybank am equities regional head robin yeoh said southeast asian markets are most likely to consolidate in the next three months due to the recent downturn that could be seen in the economic data of various countries. asean markets were soft over the past two weeks. they are expected to pick up once infrastructure spending in indonesia and thailand is implemented, said yeoh. he said the consolidation of asean market will probably see malaysia in the same region of growth that it has seen over the past few months, as there is a lack of catalysts locally. the upside of the malaysian market will be capped. after the consolidation phase is over, malaysia can probably go up as well. it (the malaysian market) has not gone up much [in the past few months]. the malaysian market is currently up 4% to 5%, at the most, he added. however, he said the asean region remains an attractive investment destination due to dynamic economic growth, rising population and favourable demographics, with a large population of younger people. on the chinese market, bosera asset management (international) co ltd deputy ceo conrad cheng said the valuation of some sectors in the chinese market is a bit stretched and that there is now a cautious outlook on the chinese market in the short term. still, owing to other factors such as the easing of monetary policy and major infrastructure projects, the long-term outlook for the chinese market is still bullish, said cheng. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys

mid-december last year. the index reached a high of 1,856.51 points last tuesday, before retreating to close at 1,844.31 points on friday. hurt by the weak ringgit and low oil prices, the fbm klcis decline towards the end of 2014 had wiped out considerable gains from the years high, which had briefly exceeded 1,890 points in july when the market had begun to look overvalued. this year, the local bellwether has gained more than 5% to date. meanwhile, its regional peers, the hang seng index and nikkei 225, have each gained over 14%. at current levels, which is almost back to last years high, fund managers and analysts are mixed about the local stock markets valuations  some say it is still overvalued, while others say there is still upside potential. pacific mutual fund bhd chief investment officer koh huat soon believes that at the current price-earnings ratio (per) of 16 times, the fbm klci is overvalued as it is trading above the historical average. according to him, the expensive valuation is mainly supported by government-linked domestic funds. the government faces tremendous challenges in meeting budget targets as we are not out of the woods yet in terms of the impact of cheap oil prices on the budget and current account. this makes malaysia vulnerable to a credit rating downgrade, he tells the edge. as it is, fitch ratings last month said malaysias credit rating is more than 50% likely to be downgraded on a worsening trade balance and the inability of state investment fund 1malaysia development bhd (1mdb) to meet its debt obligations. pacific mutual expects the fbm klci to reach 1,817 points by year-end, 1.6% lower than its current level. we dont see much upside. with headwinds before us  namely the challenges of meeting budget targets, shrinking current account surplus, heightened political risks and threat of a rating downgrade  it is difficult to justify paying above-mean valuation for this market at the moment, koh explains. on the contrary, danny wong, chief executive of areca capital sdn bhd, believes that factors such as weak oil prices, the impact of the goods and services tax (gst) and the possibility of a rating downgrade have largely been priced in. i think many have priced in the negative factors. some foreign funds may return due to our economic growth and continued economic transformation programme initiatives, especially our subsidy reforms. what we need is to overcome the bearish ringgit issues, wong tells the edge. the ringgit has plunged more than 18% against the greenback since august last year, hitting a low of 3.73 on march 20, 2015. it is currently hovering around 3.66. wong says the fbm klci and malaysian stocks in general deserve a premium over their peers due to their defensive nature and high dividend yields. over at etiqa insurance and takaful, head of research chris eng says the fbm klci is not yet overvalued. however, the market is expected to continue seeing some volatility, and etiqa is forecasting a broad range of 1,828 to 1,870 points for the year. the following are some fbm klci component stocks on the radar screen of the investment community that may be worth a look. tenaga nasional bhd on tenaga, we continue to see relatively low coal prices and increasing market share as the company completes its manjung 4 [coal-fired] power plant and hydro dams, says eng. manjung 4 recently missed its end-march commercial operation date and is expected to be delayed for another two to four weeks. but ta securities james ratnam says the delay is not expected to have any operational impact on tenaga (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.8) given the short delay and 30% reserve margin. tenagas unit fuel cost is expected to fall as it increases the use of coal  a cheaper alternative to gas  in the coming quarters as manjung 4 comes on stream, says pacific mutuals koh. lower generation cost would present an opportunity for the subsidy on liquefied natural gas to be reduced without an adverse impact on tariff during the next review. tenaga has also just received 90.21% acceptance for its offer to take over integrax bhd, a strategic move that will ensure the latter focuses on its coal handling services to tenagas janamanjung power plant complex. including the 1,000mw manjung 5, the complex will have a total capacity of 4,000mw  16% of peninsular malaysias capacity. ta raised its target price on tenaga to rm16.29 from rm16.25, and has a buy call on the stock. tenaga closed at rm14.50 last friday with a per of over 11 times  still cheap, according to etiqas eng. as it is, tenaga trades on a calendar 2016 per of just 12 times against the markets fbm100 per of 15 times. tenaga deserves to be re-rated to at least parity with the market, says koh. rhb capital bhd a catalyst to watch for in rhb cap is a possible internal reorganisation of the group, whereby rhb bank will take over rhb caps listing status and house all its entities. the exercise, which could include a rights issue, is expected to improve the groups tax efficiency, although details are not yet clear. on rhb cap, plans to restructure the bank and the return of foreign interest (to the fbm klci) should help boost the company, which also has a new ceo, says eng. on march 5, rhb cap (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 2.1) announced that group ceo kellee kam had resigned from his position. this will take effect in may. the group has identified a successor and is awaiting bank negara malaysias approval. some quarters do not expect the banking sector to see exciting prospects in the near term. that said, rhb caps valuations may still be a selling point at this time. bank stocks are not currently overvalued. they are good as defensive and dividend-yielding stocks, says edmund tham, head of research at mercury securities sdn bhd. consumer loan growth may be slower due to the gst, which may affect sentiment, and bank negara guidelines [which may result in] low approval rates. but corporate banking, trade finance and investment banking will still be growing, he adds. where rhb cap is concerned, its 12 months trailing per is just under 11 times  compared with public bank bhds 16 times and malayan banking bhds 13 times  and it has a dividend yield of 1.96%. public bank in a banking sector that is experiencing a slowdown in growth and an increase in non-performing loans, public bank (fundamental: 2.8; valuation: 1.5) has largely bucked the trend. the banking group outperformed its peers by a large margin in numerous valuation metrics, and its position as a favoured stock among fund managers could point to further upside. public banks share price is expensive but investors are willing to pay a premium because it is perceived as a defensive pick. the stock carries a large weight in the composite index, so it has to be reflected in a fund managers portfolio, says koh. compared with its banking peers, public bank was a top performer for the financial year ended dec 31, 2014. return on equity stood at 19.9% compared with the industry average of 13%. its loan growth saw a 10.8% increase on a year-on-year basis, also outperforming the industry average of 8.7%. in a march 25 note, affin hwang capital research says it expects the banking group to continue the outperformance this year, pegging a target price of rm21.80 to the stock. the group has the lowest gross impaired loan ratio (of 0.65%), the number one position in franchise retail banking and a well-capitalised balance sheet, it says. misc bhd ever since the failed takeover bid by national oil firm petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) in 2013, miscs (fundamental: 2; valuation: 1) share price has appreciated by leaps and bounds. the stock gained 24% this year as at april 10, making it one of the best-performing stocks among the 30 constituents in the fbm klci. being one of the few niche industry stocks on the component index, misc is influenced by external factors in the shipping sector. with the prevailing low oil price environment prompting companies to store their oil inventory, crude tanker rates have seen a resurgence, thanks to the uptick in demand. a lifting of sanctions on iranian oil production is also set to offset the delivery of newbuild ships, ensuring that tanker demand outpaces supply. both factors are significant re-rating catalysts for misc. in a prolonged situation of cheap oil, the demand for storage will continue to grow if the oil oversupply continues. current crude tanker rates are already at multi-year highs, which is indicative of a longer-term trend, says an analyst of a bank-backed research house, who has a buy rating on misc.  this article first appeared in capital, the edge malaysia weekly, on april

figure was sequentially higher yet lower on-year at plus 5.3% quarter-on-quarter and minus 9.3% year-on-year respectively. however, the sequential and on-year reported growth figures require some adjustments as they slightly dampened the fair earnings picture. the reported sequential growth number was slightly depressed by rm358.9 million impairment provisions recorded by misc bhd in 4qcy14. moreover, the on-year growth number was further weakened by the effect of rm581.4 million gain on disposal of gumusut-kakap fps in 4qcy13, also by misc, it said. midf research said the percentage of companies within its coverage which reported earnings that came below expectations rose further to 36% (highest since second quarter 2013) in 4qcy14 from 31% in the preceding quarter. however, it is noteworthy that the proportion of positive surprises also increased to 15% (highest since fourth quarter 2011) during the quarter under review vis-u00e0-vis 6% recorded in 3qcy14. accordingly,

disappointing earnings streak continued into 4qcy14 with the aggregate numbers coming in plainly below expectations. this is attested by (i) the apparent negative variances between the overall

for an m&a. as you know, part of our business involves lending activity in a non-local currency denomination, he said, adding that the facility will most likely be us dollar-denominated. historically,

macd and stochastic but positive readings for its dmi and oscillator. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at the 1,738, 1,770 and 1,800 levels, while the resistance areas of 1,806, 1,831 and 1,858 will cap any index rebound. the fbm klcis 18 and 40 simple moving averages (sma) depict a neutral trend for its daily chart. however, the price bars of the index are now between the 50 and 200 sma and remains in a neutral position on that front. the recent fall from its all-time high of 1,896.23 saw a trough at 1,671.82. the price rebound from 1,671.82 stalled at 1,831.41 (on feb 4 2015) and remains below the 200-sma line of 1,828.61. due to the poorer tone for the fbm klci index, we are recommending a chart sell on brahims holdings bhd (brahims). recently, brahims made the news after agreeing to new terms for its in-flight supplies agreement with malaysian airlines (mas). as part of the mas cost restructuring by khazanah nasional, brahims 25-year rm6.25 billion exclusive contract will take a 25% cut in monthly bills, pending a new catering deal. brahims also agreed to a 60% cut in payments withheld by mas. the negative news flow has triggered the wave of recent selling that drove brahims share price down below rm1. looking at its fourth quarter of financial year 2014 (4qfy14) results announcement, brahims recorded a 27.5% fall in revenue to rm79 million in this quarter from rm109 million in 4qfy13. the group also recorded a pre-tax loss of rm58 million in 4qfy14 compared with a profit of rm22 million in 4qfy13. the poor profitability was due to concessions given to mas under its recovery plan amounting to rm56 million by its subsidiary. brahims also pointed out that the in-flight catering segment continues to remain challenging despite the expected increase in passenger load as its profit margins may be adversely impacted by the implementation of a new pricing methodology. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that only two research houses have coverage on brahims. of the two research houses there is one sell call and one hold call. brahims 12-month trailing earnings per share on bloomberg indicate a loss of 14 sen. its price-to-book value ratio of 0.68 times indicates that its share price is trading at a discount to its book value. brahims chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly down. its share price made a massive decline since its all-time high of rm2.71 on march 7, 2014. since that rm2.71 high, brahims fell to its recent low of 81 sen this month. as prices broke below its recent key critical support levels of rm1.16 and rm1.12, look to sell brahims on any rebounds to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term downtrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, stochastic and oscillator) have issued sell signals and now depict very firm indications of brahims eventual move towards much lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of 81 sen, rm1.12 and rm1.16. we expect brahims to witness weak buying interest at its supports of 55 sen, 74 sen and 80 sen. its downside targets are located at 40 sen, 36 sen, 30 sen and 18 sen.  lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed in the article are the opinions of the writer

number forecast operators (nfos) could be impacted by the implementation of the goods and services tax (gst) in april. the gst act 2014 stipulates that the supply of services related to betting, sweepstakes, lotteries, gaming machines or games of chance will be subject to gst. according to the formula in the act, gst will be imposed on the net amount received on nfo sales after deducting taxes and duties, and the prize payout ratio. currently, the highly regulated industry is subject to a gaming tax of 8% on gross sales and pool betting duty of 8% (taxed on net sales). it also contributes 10% of its pre-taxed profits to the national sports council. apart from that, it pays corporate taxes. pricewaterhousecoopers taxation services sdn bhd executive director raja kumaran says, what this essentially means is that gst could cause a reduction in the prize payout as the actual value of the wager could be lower than what it is now  a prize payout is dependent on the amount placed on the bet. gst, a consumption tax, would have a direct impact on punters, who may shift to illegal betting because of the higher prize payouts from illegal nfos. in a recent report, maybank investment bank research notes that illegal nfos prize payouts are 10% to 20% higher than those offered by legal nfos. if the nfos are not allowed to increase the prize payout, its attractiveness will be reduced. this would drive punters to the illegal betting scene where they can get a higher prize payout because of the absence of tax, says an analyst with a local research house. pwcs raja opines that other taxes imposed on the industry, such as the gaming tax, should be reduced correspondingly when the gst is introduced. this would be fairer for the industry, he adds. maybank ib research says in its report that the nfos are already facing weak nfo-related sales due to poor consumer sentiment, which has caused punters to reduce the size of bets. the 6% gst that will be implemented from april 1 onwards is expected to weaken consumer sentiment further and therefore, threaten nfo sales again. assuming no new games are introduced, the nfos we spoke to (berjaya sports toto bhd (btoto), magnum bhd and pan malaysian pools sdn bhd) are budgeting nfo sales/draw to soften by approximately 2% in 2015, it says in the report. for the third quarter ended sept 30, 2014, magnums revenue contracted 4.6% to rm669.99 million from rm702.39 million a year ago. net profit was down 30% to rm45.42 million from rm64.77 million previously. alliance research highlights that gaming revenue per outlet per draw for the third quarter fell 4% compared with a year ago due to lower ticket sales. this was due to the relatively unattractive prizes caused by the higher frequency of wins during the quarter, weak consumer sentiment and increased competition from illegal nfos. although btoto (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 0.9) reported an increase in revenue and net profit for the second quarter ended oct 31, 2014, it was mainly boosted by revenue contributions from hr owen, its franchised motor vehicle dealership. but its nfo units revenue was down 4.3% year on year due to reasons similar to magnums (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 1.2). for the second quarter, btotos revenue increased to rm1.25 billion from rm866.88 million while net profit gained 20.6% to rm99.69 million. many wonder if the nfos will be willing to sacrifice their margins by absorbing the gst element in order to protect their market share from illegal gambling dens. when contacted, btoto declined to comment. magnum could not be reached for comment. if the nfos absorb the gst element, maybank ib research estimates that their earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) margins would be trimmed by 120 basis points (bps) for magnum and 150bps for btoto, while its earnings estimate for both will be cut by 10% on a full-year basis. if they do that [absorb gst], their bottom line will be affected. it looks like neither of the options looks good for the nfos, says an analyst. with no way around this, the analyst says dividends could be affected should weak gaming revenue continue. btoto has a dividend payout policy of 75% while magnums is 80%. so far, both companies have been paying out dividends above their stated policies. for the cumulative six months ended oct 31, 2014, btoto declared a dividend of 11.5 sen compared with 10 sen a year ago. magnum declared a 15 sen dividend, same as the previous year, for the cumulative nine months ended sept 30, 2014. it is still a good dividend stock with high yield, especially now with the weakness in the share price, adds the analyst. the recent weakness in the nfos share prices could be attributed to skittish investors due to the impending implementation of gst. however, analysts believe the weakness from such concerns has been priced into the shares. over the past year, btotos share price has slid 8.3% to rm3.40 on feb 5. over the same period, magnums fell to a low of rm2.56 before rebounding to last thursdays close of rm2.79.   note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance

reshuffle and plans to cut costs substantially, underscore efforts to ride out a tougher banking environment. industry observers say the restructuring  cimbs third major one since 2005  is necessary to stem the slide in the groups performance in recent years. the changes, announced last friday, are also seen as a stamping of the mark by the groups new leader, acting ceo tengku datuk zafrul aziz. zafrul, 42 this year, had joined cimb (fundamental 1.35; valuation: 2.10) in january 2014 from malayan banking bhd. later in september, he took on the top post at the group, replacing datuk seri nazir razak who went on to become the chairman. sources say the management reshuffle, which includes the creation of a few new posts, also came about because three key individuals  datuk lee kok kwan (ceo of corporate banking, treasury and markets), kenny kim (group cfo and ceo of group strategy and strategic investments) and arwin rashid (country head for indonesia as well as president director and ceo of bank cimb niaga)  had expressed their desire to eventually leave. all three are no longer in management roles in the new line-up. lee and kim, in particular, are some of nazirs trusted lieutenants who have been with the group through thick and thin over the years. thus, it is no surprise that they have been given advisory roles in the new line-up. lee, 48, who has been with the group since 1996 and helped set up its risk management department, will go on to become a board member while arwin, 57, plans to retire in a few months. kim, 46, has played a key role in cimbs major corporate exercises, including all its mergers, acquisitions and disposals since 2004, as well as the regional integration of all the businesses under the group. analysts believe the reshuffle is part of a bigger plan where zafrul is reorganising the team to adjust to the changing banking landscape. they believe the stalwarts will stay on to ensure a smooth transition. theedgemarkets.com had reported earlier last friday that there would be a management reshuffle at cimb. the relatively new management team will see to the implementation of the groups mid-term strategy, known as t18 (short for target 2018). zafrul, in a press release, said as part of t18, a new regional commercial and sme banking division would be created. there will also be a new integrated wholesale banking division (combining investment banking, treasury markets and corporate banking) as well as a regional consumer banking division. analysts believe there may be job cuts in the offing. under t18, cimb is looking at cutting investment banking operating costs by about 30% this year as part of a plan to reassess its investment banking presence in asia-pacific. it gained that presence after buying most of the royal bank of scotlands investment banking assets in asia-pacific in 2012, a move that raised its costs substantially. we will be rightsizing, toughening our regional operating model and streamlining processes. and this is just phase 1 of a long list of cost management measures the firm is undertaking, zafrul said. t18 came about from a strategic review exercise that the group began in january last year. elaborating on the groups t18 targets, zafrul said he expects cimb to achieve, by the end of the financial year 2018, a return on equity (roe) of more than 15%, cet-1 of more than 11% and a cost-to-income ratio of less than 50%, and consumer banking to contribute about 60% to its income. cimbs roe has been on a downward trend since fy2012 while its cost-to-income ratio has been trending upwards since fy2011. from 16.4% in fy2011, roe had dropped to 16% in fy2012 and 15.5% in fy2013. the groups annualised 9mfy2014 net roe stood at 11.6%, its cost-to-income ratio at 57.8% and cet-1 at 9.7%. its consumer banking segment accounted for 44.2% of profit before tax for the nine months to sept 30, 2014, while corporate, treasury and markets contributed 44.8%, investment 10.5% and investment banking 0.5%. meanwhile, the cost-to-income ratio has been rising, from 55.68% in fy2010 to 54.69% in fy2011, 56.4% in fy2012 and 57.6% in fy2013.  it looks like they are serious about cost but it is a long-term target of three years. cimb will have to demonstrate to the market that they can execute this. they have set targets before and not met them. for example, their roe target for 2014 of 13.5% to 14% is likely to be missed. the market will want to see more evidence of a concrete action plan before they are willing to take their word for it, says a banking analyst.  also from the announcement, it looks like some of the old guard are vacating their positions. the market already assumed this will be happening. all eyes will be on whether this new reorganisation will bring about the results that cimb says it expects to achieve. a reorganisation is a reorganisation, whether it will work or not u2026 only time will tell. another banking analyst says bringing down the ib cost by 30% is a big task. if they succeed, it will be good for the group. another interesting point is that in order for them to achieve the 15% roe, cimb will likely have to double their current profits by 2018. they must have at least rm7.5 billion to rm8 billion in net profit to achieve their 15% roe target. actually, what they are doing is bold and long-term positive if executed well. the change of roles for lee and kim will cushion a bigger fallout than if they were to completely leave the bank now. a head of a foreign securities firm says, it gives the perception that there is some form of continuity. in the short term, with this new reorganisation, there will definitely be uncertainty, which will distract management time and potentially, they may lose some business. this is the groups third major reorganisation since a restructuring in 2005 gave birth to the second largest banking group in the country. cimb last embarked on one in 2011, when the group management committee led by nazir was narrowed to 15 from 21. similarities between the current revamp and the one in 2011 are that the exercises resulted in the group ceo holding more than one function. as a result of the revamp in september 2011, nazir held dual roles of group ceo and head of the malaysian consumer bank. he was also involved in investment banking. in the current reorganisation, zafrul will be acting ceo of the group and will also assume the post of ceo of wholesale banking. we will recalibrate many things in 2015, then have three full years to accelerate based on those stronger foundations to reach our targets for 2018. the t18 initiatives are focused on streamlining to get our cost structure right, focusing on priority areas where we have traditionally under-punched and strengthening the organisation culture, zafrul said of the t18 strategy. we have grown aggressively over the years and have a fantastic platform and brand. however, we have weaknesses and we can no longer depend on a high-growth operating environment. the strategic review has been about identifying areas where we are but should not be, areas where we need to be better and areas where we are already strong. these form the basis of an action plan to get us to our targets for 2018, which will no doubt require some near-term sacrifices, he added.  note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys

operations in 2007, and the question remains whether the low-cost, long-haul model is a viable one for the carrier. historically, others have tried and failed, so what will turn the tide for airasia bhds sister airline? in the past year, the question about the models viability has risen once again after aax fell into the red in the fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2013 (4qfy13). it has not recovered since. for aax shareholders, it has so far been a bumpy ride with its share price now trading at 58 sen, more than half of its initial public offering price of rm1.25 per share. its market capitalisation stood at rm1.37 billion. while the low-cost model has worked for airasia bhds short-haul flights, investors might be spooked by aaxs (fundamental: 0; valuation: 0) inability to return to profitability thus far. for its latest financial year ended dec 31, 2014 (fy14), net loss more than quintupled to rm519.35 million from rm88.27 million in losses the year before. this was on the back of a 27% increase in revenue to rm2.94 billion from rm2.31 billion in fy13. revenue per available seat-kilometre (rask) reduced 0.3% from 12.06 sen to 12.02 sen in fy14 due mainly to the lower average passenger fares as the group introduced more promotional fares on newly launched routes during the year, and load factor was flat at 82% versus 82.1% in fy13, aax explained in its financial statements. from a quarterly perspective the story is the same, with losses rising 27% to rm168.43 million in 4qfy14 compared with rm132.6 million in 4qfy13. this was despite revenue growing 20% to rm819.27 million from rm680.45 million a year ago. the fall in jet fuel prices will unequivocally be good for aaxs bottom line, but we dont think it will be sufficient to return the carrier to the black [this year] due to the competitive operating environment. aax is likely to pass on a significant portion of the fuel cost savings to consumers, alliance research analyst tan kee hoong said in a feb 25 note. global crude oil prices have fallen off its peak of us$115 per barrel in june 2014 by almost 60% to below us$50 per barrel now, which inherently reduces the cost of jet fuel. if crude oil trades lower than us$70 per barrel, aax will be able to survive. but the question is what happens when prices are back to normal at us$100 and above per barrel. will it be able to survive? the jury is still out on that one, maybank investment bank bhd aviation analyst mohshin aziz told the edge financial daily. mohshin cautioned that when times are tough, aax might not have what it takes to weather the storm as seen in its financials for fy13 and fy14. when times are tough it would be predictable that [all] in the market would lower their fares. when that happens, aax will lose its [competitive] edge completely because there is not much of a price gap left, he added. another analyst pointed out that when it comes to such price competition, many consumers do not mind paying a small premium for the comforts of a full-service carrier when flying long distance. another challenge for aax so far has been its loss-making routes. so far this year, the airline has discontinued its flights to adelaide and nagoya that were incurring losses to the group. it also slashed the frequency of flights to sydney, perth and melbourne late last year. aax needs to tweak its business model and growth plan to be more relevant to its core market. they will have to experiment a little with its routes and frequency, and maybe permanently remove certain routes that simply do not have enough volume to be viable, said mohshin. in this low price environment, aaxs short-term strategy is to survive, recapitalise and conserve capital. it is fire-fighting at the moment in order to build strength, beyond which it can focus on growth, he added. nevertheless, analysts have noted that aaxs balance sheet is not looking as good as it used to be. its cash and bank balances almost halved to rm125 million as at end-december 2014, from rm263 million at end-fy13. meanwhile, its trade payables soared 63% to rm656.5 million from rm346.8 million in the same period. still, aax has managed to scale back total borrowings to rm1.58 billion compared with rm2 billion as at end-fy13. of this, rm1.07 billion or 67.5% consists of long-term borrowings, while the remaining rm513.2 million is short-term. it is worth noting, however, a whopping 95% of the total borrowings comprised us dollar-denominated debt, with the rest in ringgit. aax also proposed a cash call on jan 30 for a renounceable rights issue with free attached warrants. this could raise rm395 million that the carrier intends to use for working capital and to service its loans. but maybe recent events at the airline could lend investors some confidence, as airasia executive chairman and co-founder datuk kamarudin meranun steps in as group chief executive officer (ceo) of aax, taking over from azran osman-rani, while benyamin ismail is acting ceo. kamarudin will spearhead the development of aax group and, alongside benyamin, will lead the reorganisation and turnaround exercise to strengthen the airlines balance sheet and to maximise profitability to ensure a stronger financial footing for the airline. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical

its first quarter of financial year 2015 (1qfy15) results at the end of november 2014 and is expected to announce its 2qfy15 results sometime late this month. it has three main operating divisions which contribute towards the groups operating profit in 1qfy15. these divisions are property development which contributes approximately 83%, property investment which chips in about 11%, while leisure and hospitality and others make up the remaining 6%. in the results announcement, ioi properties revenue rose by about 34% year-on-year (y-o-y) to rm375 million for 1qfy15 from rm280 million in 1qfy14, while profit before tax expanded correspondingly by 12.8% y-o-y to rm150 million in 1qfy15 from rm133 million in 1qfy14. according to ioi properties announcement, the improved profitability was attributed to positive contributions from all its operating segments. going forward, ioi properties pointed out that the malaysian property sector remains challenging with tighter financial criteria by banks on loan approvals. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that eight research houses cover ioi properties, of which there are six hold calls and two buy calls. this stock currently trades at a low price-earnings ratio of 6.7 times while its price-to-book value ratio of 0.62 times indicates that its share price is trading at a huge discount to its book value. ioi properties chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly down. its share price has made a large decline since its all-time high of rm3.36 on jan 15, 2014. since that rm3.36

"title": "has 1mdb missed deadline for rm2 billion loan again, asks pua", "article": " kuala lumpur (feb 6): the silence over whether 1malaysia development bhd (1mdb) has repaid its rm2 billion loan, which was due a week ago, only leads to speculation that it has once again failed to meet the deadline despite assurances from the government and the strategic investor, says a dap lawmaker. petaling jaya utara mp tony pua said the rm2 billion loan was due on january 31 after the deadline was extended twice since november last year. \"so, what happened to 1mdbs rm2 billion overdue loan?\" the dap national publicity secretary asked in a statement today. for the past three weeks, pua said, speculation on how 1mdb would repay the debt had been intense. he said among others, there was speculation on whether it would ask for another extension or get an emergency loan from local tycoon tan sri ananda krishnan to temporarily settle the debt. the edge financial daily had reported last week that ananda was believed to have firmed up an agreement to loan 1mdb as much as rm2 billion to help the strategic investment fund pay the debt to malayan banking bhd (maybank) and rhb bank bhd that was due on january 31. it was understood that the loan, however, was merely an interim measure, according to the report. pua said the malaysian financial markets had been jittery over the ability of 1mdb to repay the loan which was part of its total outstanding debts which exceeded rm42 billion. \"this rm2 billion loan itself is part of a rescheduled and restructured debt it couldnt pay in november 2013. \"the edge financial daily even reported that bank negara malaysia has summoned the key executives of 1mdb over the issue and warned them of dire consequences should they fail to meet the next deadline at the end of january. \"if 1mdb defaults on the rm2 billion loan, then the entire outstanding debt of 1mdb becomes due,\" he said. pua said this was despite 1mdb recently claiming that it had fully \"redeemed\" its investment in the cayman islands, amounting to us$1.1 billion (rm3.9 billion). \"nobody appears to know where the money is, and for those who do know, they have refused to be publicly accountable for 1mdbs actions,\" he said. pua warned that under such situations, the malaysian financial system might collapse under the enormous stress while the federal governments credit ratings would take a massive hit. he said the ability of 1mdb to repay the loan had therefore become a public interest issue, which must be addressed either by 1mdb itself or the finance ministry in a timely manner. pua said prime minister datuk seri najib razak, who is also the finance minister, could no longer afford to remain silent on the matter without further eroding the confidence of the financial markets. \"his deputy finance minister datuk ahmad maslan had consistently insisted that 1mdb was in sound financial health and never had any problems settling their debt obligations. \"such empty assurances, or even outright untruths can no longer hoodwink the concerned malaysian public,\" he said, urging putrajaya to come clean about the debt situation in 1mdb. he said 1mdb had become a laughing stock in the international financial press such as the wall street journal and financial times. \"i reiterate my earlier call for najib to instruct a special audit of 1mdb by the auditor-general or a reputable independent auditor to uncover its financial shenanigans,\" pua added.

75.20 points from last fridays closing level of 1,820.89. the ringgit was weaker against the us dollar at 3.4485 as brent crude oil tumbled to us$69.72 (rm240). the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since may 2013 had key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69 (high), 1,802.88 (low), 1,896.23

1,660, 1,702 and 1,743 levels, whilst the resistance areas of 1,745, 1,789 and 1,858 will cap any index rebound. the klcis 18 and 40 simple moving averages (smas) depict an obvious downtrend for its daily chart. in addition, the 50 and 200 smas have also issued a dead cross and the index prices are now below these two longer-term smas. the index appears to be in a severe downtrend since the 1,896.23 high of july 2014. compounding the indexs bearish tone is also a break of the critical neckline support of a head and shoulders top pattern. with the break of the neckline, the klci index is headed to 1,630.87 in the medium term. intermediate short-term downside targets are 1,705 and 1,696. due to the much weaker tone for the klci index, we are recommending a chart sell on puncak niaga

7.1% and profit before tax fell 16.8% compared with the 9mfy13e period. further to the announcement, the lower profitability was due to sluggish revenue contributions from its oil and gas, and construction segments, together with higher finance costs and provision of impairment loss on trade receivables. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that five research houses have coverage on puncak niaga. of the five, there are three buy calls and two neutral calls. this stock currently trades at a reasonable and low price-earnings ratio of 5.92 times, while its price-to-book value ratio of 0.60 times indicates that its share price is trading at a steep discount to its book value. the reported shareholding changes on bloomberg revealed there was net selling from both local and foreign investors over the past month. puncak niagas chart trend on the daily and weekly timeframes is very firmly down. its share price made a large decline since its major weekly wave-5 high of rm3.76 in june 2014. since that rm3.76 high, puncak niaga fell to its december 2014 recent low of rm2.66. as prices broke below its recent key critical support levels of rm3.30 and rm3.05, look to sell puncak niaga on any rebounds to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to medium-term downtrends for this stock. the daily and weekly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and stochastic) have issued sell signals and now depict very firm indications of puncak niagas eventual move towards much lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm2.74, rm3.05 and rm3.30. we expect puncak niaga to witness weak buying interest at its support levels of rm2.05, rm2.27 and rm2.49. its downside targets are located at rm2.13, rm1.95 and rm1.38.

bank bhd, a unit of malaysias second biggest lender, has submitted a proposal to the securities commission malaysia for a rm5 billion programme, a person with knowledge of the deal who asked not to be identified because the information hasnt been released, said on wednesday. public islamic bank bhd received approval for a similar-sized programme, an april 23 stock exchange filing showed. amislamic bank bhd, maybank islamic bank bhd and rhb islamic bank bhd have sold a combined rm2.2 billion worth of basel iii sukuk since late february. the rhb sale on may 2 drew bids for 7.5 times the rm500 million on offer, showing that more than doubling malaysian corporate sukuk sales this year isnt damping demand. the countrys syariah-compliant banking assets climbed 12% last year and they now account for a quarter of the total, central bank data showed. demand for basel iii sukuk will be healthy as theres still ample liquidity in the system, datuk mohd effendi abdullah, head of islamic markets at aminvestment bank bhd, malaysias third biggest islamic debt arranger last year, said in a may 12 interview. banks that havent issued such bonds will have to follow suit. lenders that are yet to sell basel iii securities that comply with the religions ban on interest include hong leong islamic bank bhd, affin islamic bank bhd, bank islam malaysia bhd and alliance islamic bank bhd. the basel committee issued rules in 2010 to boost banks capital-adequacy ratios and give them an extra buffer against losses following the global financial crisis that started in 2008. bonds that comply with the regulations are typically higher yielding as they can be written down if local regulators deem the issuing lender non-viable. worldwide sukuk sales have increased 13% to us$17.9 billion (rm57.8 billion) so far in 2014, data compiled by bloomberg showed. malaysian companies have sold rm26.1 billion of syariah-compliant debt this year, compared with rm11.8 billion at the same point in 2013. that makes up 51% of all corporate bond offers in the country, from 39% for the whole of 2010, central bank figures showed. demand for sukuk from stronger banks will always be there as we are seeing investors shifting to sukuk, hoe cheah how, chief investment officer overseeing rm38 billion at rhb asset management sdn bhd, said in an interview on wednesday. the governments drive to promote islamic finance will help boost syariah-compliant debt offerings. malaysian banking assets that comply with the religions ban on interest climbed to a record rm556.5 billion in 2013, according to the central banks annual report. amislamic bank issued the countrys first basel iii sukuk on feb 26, selling 10-year bonds at a yield of 5.07%. ambank (m) bhd, owned by the same parent company as amislamic, sold basel notes of the same tenor at 5.2% in december. maybank islamic bank issued rm1.5 billion of the 10-year securities at 4.75% on march 28. that compared with the 4.9% its non-islamic parent paid when it issued similar-maturity paper in january. sukuk sales in malaysia are supported by demand from sovereign funds, islamic insurers and pension funds, which have a strong preference for the debt, said wasim saifi, the chief executive officer of standard chartered saadiq bhd in kuala lumpur. this additional pool of islamic liquidity has historically helped to tighten the profit

the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the indexs price movements in the next few months following may 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69 (high) and 1,802.88 (low). the indexs daily signals are all positive, with upbeat dmi, oscillator, cci, macd and stochastic readings. as such, its obvious support levels are seen at the 1,802, 1,853 and 1,879 levels, while the resistance and all-time high of 1,882 may offer some token profit-taking activities. should the index surpass 1,882.20, we believe a move to the next two upside targets of 1,888 and 1,918 for the klci may be possible. its simple moving averages depict an uptrend for its daily, weekly and monthly charts, albeit with very obvious bearish divergence signals. due to its positive chart signals, we believe investors would adopt a nibble on dips tone for the klci. due to the klcis better tone for now, we are recommending a chart buy on mitrajaya holdings bhd, which is expected to announce its results for the first quarter ended march 31 of financial year 2014 (1qfy14) at the end of may. as for its 4qfy13 results, the groups revenue increased significantly by 39.1% year-on-year (y-o-y) to rm123.8 million from rm89.0 million in 4qfy12. its profit before tax also rose correspondingly by 40.6% y-o-y to rm19.4 million from rm13.8 million in 4qfy12. the higher profitability was attributed to overall improvement in all its divisions, mainly construction, property development and healthcare. going forward, mitrajayas order book rose to rm889.8 million after it secured a rm427.9 million building project from putrajaya holdings sdn bhd at the end of 2013. a check of bloomu00adberg consensus reveals that no research house covers mitrajaya. the stock is currently trading at a low historical price-earnings ratio of 11.6 times and at a fair price-to-book value ratio of 1.01 times. looking at the current reported shareholding changes on bloomberg, we observed that no major buying or selling was transacted by its top 30 shareholders recently. mitrajayas chart trend looks very strong. its share price made an obvious rise since its weekly wave-2 low of 43 sen in august 2013. since that 43 sen low, it surged to its recent may 2014 high of 87.5 sen. mitrajayas chart has moved into strong daily, weekly and monthly downtrends to its recent may 2014 high of 87.5 sen. as it broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of 65 sen and 74 sen, look to buy mitrajaya on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to medium term uptrends for this stock. the daily indicators (such as the cci, dmi, macd, stochastic and oscillator) are very firm and now depict firm indications of mitrajayas eventual move towards much higher levels. we expect the company to attract heavy buying towards its support levels of 65 sen, 74 sen and 86 sen. it will attract minor profit-taking activities at the resistance levels of 87.5 sen, 91 sen and rm1.10. its upside targets are now located at 91 sen, rm1.17, rm1.22 and rm1.45. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed in the article are

breakup of the 76-year-old unprofitable airline. even before the jet vanished march 8 on its way to beijing from kuala lumpur, malaysian airline system bhd. had run up losses of $1.3 billion in the previous three years. the incident has put the carrier under global scrutiny, jeopardizing its reputation and prompting boycotts by travel agents in china. analysts now project losses through 2016 and the subang, malaysia-based company is trading near the lowest since 2001 relative to its assets, according to data compiled by bloomberg. split up, the government-controlled airline could fetch $1.3 billion, an amount thats more than 10 percent higher than the companys market value last week, said malayan banking bhd. in this kind of environment, they have the sympathy of the whole world if they want to do a restructuring, james lau, who helps manage $300 million at pheim asset management sdn. in kuala lumpur, said by phone, referring to malaysian air. shareholders would like to see them take the hard decisions. the jet with 239 passengers and crew vanished from civilian radars while headed north over the gulf of thailand. it then doubled back over peninsular malaysia and flew south into some of the worlds most remote waters. no physical trace of the aircraft has been found. the search, now focused on an area 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) below the surface of the indian ocean, is the longest for a missing passenger plane in modern aviation history. ticket sales in china, home to most of the missing aircrafts passengers, travel agents elong inc. and ly.com have stopped selling tickets for malaysian air flights. qunar cayman islands ltd., a travel website controlled by baidu inc., also boycotted the business. baidu owns chinas most popular search engine. already, there are more vacant seats on malaysian airs international flights. planes on those routes in march were on average 74 percent full, the lowest figure in almost two years, company filings show. in the same month in 2013, average seat occupancy was 80 percent. before the plane disappeared, malaysian air had been struggling with increased competition and higher costs. rivals such as airasia bhd. have flooded the region with planes and driven down fares. malaysian air missed its target to be profitable last year, as higher costs for items including fuel, maintenance and financing wiped out revenue gains. loss forecast the airline, majority owned by government investment company khazanah nasional bhd., will lose another $346 million by the end of 2016, according to analysts estimates compiled by bloomberg. things are not working, mohshin aziz, an analyst at maybank in kuala lumpur, said by phone. doing the same thing over and over again and hoping for a different result is just plain madness. listing malaysian airs profitable divisions and selling stakes in two aviation businesses could raise 4.15 billion ringgit ($1.3 billion), mohshin said in an april 16 report. the engineering business could fetch 2 billion ringgit on the stock market, while the airport terminal services unit could be valued at 587 million ringgit, according to mohshin. a low- cost rural service, firefly, could be worth 1.24 billion ringgit, he said. malaysian air said in an e-mailed statement that it couldnt immediately comment. khazanah wont comment on speculation, spokesman mohd asuki abas said by phone. singapore precedent singapore airlines ltd. has shown the value of such sales. in 2000, it sold stakes in sia engineering co. and singapore airport terminal services ltd., known as sats, in initial public offerings. since the end of their first financial year as publicly listed entities, the two companies combined market value has more than quadrupled to $7.14 billion. for malaysian air, ipos would be easier if the government first bought the rest of the airline and delisted it, mohshin said. that would enable the company to focus on the loss-making airline and cargo units, and its bloated workforce, free from stock-market scrutiny, he said. any opportunity to put themselves out of the spotlight will be good, mohshin said. mh370 is going to put the company under the microscope for an extended period of time. hiving off those profitable businesses would allow management to cut the excess fat weighing on the airline, said lau at pheim asset management. malaysian air employees each generate $230,000 of revenue a year, less than half the amount at singapore air, according to the most recent data compiled by bloomberg. workers at thai airways international pcl and pt garuda indonesia also bring in more sales. all shareholders the airline could be broken up while its still listed, so that all shareholders can reap the benefit, lau said. the stock has fallen so much that a buyout first would short-change minority investors, he said. shares of malaysian air have dropped 10 percent since flight 370 disappeared march 8, extending this years decline to 27 percent. that has left the airline trading at 0.93 times its book value, near the lowest level since 2001, data compiled by bloomberg show. i dont see any other way than creative destruction, said shukor yusof, an independent airline analyst formerly with standard & poors in singapore. how much longer do you want to support a company that doesnt make money? today, malaysian air shares were unchanged at 22.5 sen at 9:26 a.m. in kuala lumpur. addressing costs while malaysian air is facing multiple challenges now, a breakup or government buyout shouldnt be the priority because those hurdles are temporary and can be overcome, said ahmad maghfur usman, an analyst at rhb research institute sdn. in kuala lumpur. the issue is more about addressing the costs, he said by phone. everything from salaries and union pacts to catering agreements needs to be renegotiated to be more in malaysian airs favor, said ahmad. one challenge to a breakup may be the costs associated with compensating families of the lost passengers. malaysian air is liable under international treaty for as much as $175,000 per passenger, or a total of more than $40 million, and possibly more. still, the share decline creates an opportunity for malaysian air to remake itself now, and the company may ultimately be better off after a buyout or breakup, maybanks mohshin said. it doesnt get cheaper than this, he said. perhaps its a proper time to approach things differently."}, "92": {"date_posted": "23/4/2014", "title": "#se asia stocks* most down; singapore retreats from 11-mth high on profit taking", "article": " hanoi

generally guided for lower roe targets in 2014 given the cautious sentiment. the research house has a contrarian perspective compared to other major local research houses as it retains public bank as its top pick for the sector. it has retained a buy rating on the stock with a target price (tp) of rm23 per share. maybank ib had issued an earlier note with a sell rating on public bank, as the bank was one of the 3 banking groups that had a collective assessment allowance (ca) lower than 1.2%. the other two banks which had a ca lower than 1.2% was alliance financial group and affin bank. in a phone interview today, analyst lim sue lin of hwangdbs toldtheedgemalaysia.com that she believed public bank would be able to weather through. the minimum ca of 1.2% would have no impact on public banks profit and loss. we believe that public banks strong asset quality will be able to help them weather through. lim added that the bank would have no problems raising capital if needed to.

continue to focus on further monetising data. the growth in data usage is both explosive and secular, driven by: (i) increased users; (ii) faster internet access; and (iii) improved content. for fixed-line players, we continue to expect growth in data revenue to more than offset falling voice revenue. with maxis re-evaluating its integrated model, the competitive intensity in the fibre
