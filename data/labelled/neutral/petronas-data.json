maintenance of its vehicle entry permit (vep) and road charge (rc) systems, said the company in a filing. quarterly revenue, too, grew 34.4% to rm49.5 million from rm36.84 million in 3qfy17, driven by growth from its trade facilitation business e-work permit as well as the vep and vc systems. however, the increased revenue in it segment was offset by lower revenue recognition in ogpc sdn bhd and lower progressive billing of oilfield drilling services to petronas carigali sdn bhd during the current year quarter, said dnex. the groups energy division was affected by the lower level of upstream activities as a result of overall market softness of the oil and gas (o&g) industry, it added. for the nine-month period ended sept 30, 2017 (9mfy17), dnexs net profit slumped 59.35% to rm41.92 million from rm103.12 million in the corresponding period last year. dnex clarified that the higher earnings posted in 9mfy16 was due to the one-off share of pre-acquisition gain of excess fair value

"article": " news of tan sri mokhzani mahathir offering to sell 605 million shares or a 10.1% stake in sapura energy bhd on nov 2, while not considered a surprise to some, has, nevertheless, affected investor sentiment towards the oil and gas group. however, analysts opine that this will be mitigated in the short term. without his (mokhzanis) disposal, fundamentally, the share price should be higher, says aminvestment analyst alex goh. midf research analyst aaron tan concurs. mokhzanis share sale at a discount is a normal business decision, he says. the disposal seems natural. he had not held a top position in the company since 2015. the day the news broke, sapura energy was among the top losers and the most traded counters. its share price fell 17 sen or 10.5% to its intra-day low of rm1.45 on nov 2  its biggest one-day loss since august 2015  but later recovered to rm1.49, down 8.02%, with 79.85 million shares traded. mokhzani had offered to sell the shares, held by his british virgin island-registered company, khasera baru ltd, at between rm1.42 and rm1.49 apiece. cimb was appointed the sole book runner for the deal, reuters reported. last tuesday, mokhzani ceased to be a substantial shareholder in sapura energy after khasera baru sold 384.97 million shares for rm577.46 million or rm1.42 apiece, which was below its closing price of rm1.50. after the sale, khasera baru is left with 220.03 million shares or a 3.67% stake. mokhzani still holds 0.16% equity interest in the company. another of his private vehicle, kencana capital sdn bhd, holds 0.08%. sapura energy has continued trending downwards since, closing one sen or 0.69% lower at rm1.45 last friday. khasera baru obtained the shares from khasera baru sdn bhd  also owned by mokhzani  back in july 2015 through a share transfer, bursa malaysia filing shows. the latest share disposal by khasera baru could be at a loss for mokhzani. this is the second time he is selling a substantial stake in sapura energy, formerly known as sapurakencana petroleum bhd. sapura energy shares held by mokhzani and khasera baru were first made available to them during the merger exercise between kencana petroleum bhd and sapuracrest petroleum bhd, in which they were shareholders. the merger was done through special purpose vehicle integral key sdn bhd in may 2012, with the owners of both companies receiving cash payments and shares in the merged entity. kencana petroleum was offered rm5.98 billion or rm3 per share  via rm969 million cash and 2.51 billion shares in sapurakencana petroleum at an indicative price of rm2 apiece. the deal valued khasera barus 31.81% stake in the company at around rm1.9 billion. minus the cash portion, khasera baru received 795.32 million shares or a 13.27% stake in the merged entity, valued at rm1.59 billion. mokhzani got 9.49 million shares or a 0.16% stake. on feb 18, 2014, khasera baru sold 190.3 million sapurakencana shares at rm4.30 apiece or rm820 million in total. khasera baru netted a profit of rm439 million in that deal. the timing then was good  crude prices crashed seven months later that year. since then, shares of sapura energy have slumped amid the global oil glut. the stock has yet to recover. the latest share disposal by mokhzani did raise some eyebrows, considering sapura energys share price is currently hovering at its five-year low. furthermore, mokhzanis exit came at a time when the price of brent crude oil is recovering. brent crude breached the us$60-per-barrel mark in end-october and was trading above us$63 per barrel last friday. on that note, aminvestment banks goh opines that sapura energys prospects, too, will be brighter, after a worse-than-expected performance in the first half of its financial year ending jan 31, 2018 (fy2018). earnings recovery is likely to come from sapura energys exploration and production segment, he says. the groups website shows that it has four blocks of production assets off kerteh, terengganu, and five exploration assets in sabah and sarawak. considering the assets it acquired from newfield previously and other production sharing contracts with petronas, the company can definitely benefit from higher realised prices per barrel. on top of that, higher oil prices should boost investor confidence, especially when talking to banks for future financing, says goh, who places a fair value of rm1.54 on the counter. midfs tan concurs, but points out that sapura energys drilling segment will continue to go through a gestation period before its clients are sufficiently convinced of market prospects to give out more contracts. the drilling segment is still making losses as its tender rigs are not fully utilised. they are maintaining their vessel count, he says. sapura energy has guided analysts that it will see only five rigs utilised by end-fy2018, from six in september. just last month, it bought over a heavy-lift and pipelay vessel, sapura 3000, after discontinuing its joint venture with london-based subsea 7 sa. tan also expects sapura energys engineering and construction segment to see weaker yard utilisation rate in the coming quarters with the completion of some major projects in 3qfy2018. he has a neutral call on the stock, with a target price of rm1.69. bloomberg data shows that analyst coverage is broadly mixed on the counter, with three sell, five hold and four buy calls. there is also one outperfrom call. the target price ranges from rm1.30 to rm2.15.

lumpur: when crude oil prices took a nosedive over the past two years, so did muhibbah engineering (m) bhds share price.  fund managers were fleeing the stock simply because a significant portion of the companys contracts was sourced from the oil and gas (o&g) industry. they were worried that muhibbah engineerings earnings would be hard hit by the downturn in the o&g industry. its share price halved from the peak of rm3.40 in july 2014 to a low of rm1.60. the stock revisited the trough in august last year when crude prices sank below us$50 per barrel. nonetheless, the company has demonstrated its resilient earnings and ability to replenish its order book. muhibbah engineering has been able to keep its net profit at around rm80 million in the past three financial years.  few may have expected muhibbah engineering to be among the key beneficiaries of the refinery and petrochemical integrated development (rapid)  a massive downstream project that petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) did not shelve despite the slash on capital expenditure (capex) by the national oil firm.  currently, the company has an order book of rm2.35 billion, of which rm1.73 billion is from the construction division; rm694 million from the cranes division; and rm105 million from shipyards. this order book is expected to last two to three years, according to its financial director shirleen lee. muhibbah has secured two contracts so far in 2016. last year, muhibbah engineering secured about rm800 million to rm1 billion contracts, including jobs from rapid. lee foresees the company being able to bag contracts of similar values this year too. in short, its order book would continue to grow, so too would muhibbah engineerings earnings. she believes that securing contracts of rm800 million to rm1 billion is achievable this year. lee opines that the construction industry is in its most buoyant time that one has seen in the last 20 years. the size of cakes is so huge, so all these capex will be the revenue for contractors, she told the edge financial daily.  besides the ballooning order book, muhibbah engineering has a steady recurring income from its concession business, including airports in cambodia. in other words, the rising tourist arrivals in phnom penh and siem reap would help to boost muhibbah engineerings earnings. muhibbah owns a 21% effective stake in cambodia airports, which manages three international airports namely phnom penh, siem reap and sihanoukville airports, in a consortium with vinci sa, a french conglomerate. cambodia airports derives its income from airport passenger tax, ground handing fee, rental of duty free shops and profit sharing, aircraft landing fees, and cargo handling fees. the concession period for the three international airports is up to 2040. in financial year 2015 (fy15), total passengers for the three airports were 6.47 million, an increase by 13% from 5.73 million in fy14. lee anticipates passengers to continue to grow by double digits this year, which will sustain the companys earnings going forward. the passenger capacity of phnom penh and siem reap airports has doubled after the refurbishment works in 2015. lee also pointed out that muhibbah engineering holds a 21% stake in roadcare (m) sdn bhd, the company that has recently been granted a renewal by the malaysian government of a 10-year concession for road maintenance jobs in several states. this contributes about a few millions a year to our earnings. it fluctuates between rm5 million and rm10 million, lee said, adding that if the government requests to build new roads, then roadcare will stand a chance to earn an extra income. given the lesson learnt in the past on cost overruns, muhibbah is more cautious about expanding its businesses, and sensitive in risk management. cost overruns are just a part of the puzzle of the business. you have to continue sharpen your sword. the construction business is up and down. if you estimate it correctly, do it efficiently; you will make more. if you underestimate it, you make less, she said. when asked if the group is facing cost overruns given the weakening ringgit, she said, some are, and some are not, and some are better. eventually, with a more diversified portfolio, it will be mitigated by each other. she takes the reversing trend of the ringgit against the us dollar and oil prices recently as examples in mitigating risks. when oil prices [are] up, it augurs well for its crane business, but when oil prices fall, the groups construction works would cushion the impact. about 60% of the groups earnings are dominated by us dollars, lee noted, and that this may change going forward, as rapid may play a bigger role in the future. lee sees this as a balancing strategy that helps the group to mitigate potential risks. while petronas is lowering its budget and cutting capex, lee emphasised that the downsizing is for upstream, and that construction contracts are different from ship-chartered contracts as the charges are fixed according to the signed contracts. muhibbah engineerings share price has rebounded from its recent low of rm1.60 for late-august. a senior fund manager is of the view that muhibbah engineerings valuation is not expensive at 10 times price-earnings ratio for the earnings forecas for fy16 and nine times for fy17. the fund manager highlighted that the concession businesses (airport and road maintenance) which contribute 20% of total profit before taxes provide a good cushion against any external shocks, while cambodian airports concession is expected to register strong growth in the next few years following the recent extension works. alliance dbs research analyst chong tjen-san projects a 23% increase in net profit for fy16. muhibbah engineering posted a net profit of rm85.58 million compared with rm81.55 million the year before. so far 2015 construction margins are higher than 2014. i think their order book now comprises higher margin jobs. going forward, as long as there are ample job flows and the raw material environment remains benign, i think margins should be stable, chong said. besides, cash generating from cambodian airports concession continues to deliver strong double- digit passenger arrivals, and will benefit from the recent expansion to 12 million passengers per year while its road maintenance division recently received an extension for another 10 years. chong sees petronas licence is a trump card that the company holds to compete effectively in the highly competitive and crowded civil engineering space. meanwhile, rhb research o&g analyst wan mohd zahidi said that the company has a track record of downstream o&g construction, having done work in malaysia, singapore and the middle east. muhibbah is not a new kid on the block. i am sure it has experienced its fair share of difficulties in the industry and knows how to mitigate the slowdown in the industry. having said that, i think being in the downstream segment of the o&g industry, muhibbah is relatively sheltered from the difficulties being experienced by their upstream counterparts, he added."}, "18":

elaborate. uem is a wholly-owned unit of state controlled khazanah nasional bhd, which would indicate that it has deep pockets. uems partner, samsung, has participated in the building of many of the worlds skyscrapers including the 452m petronas twin towers, which was the tallest structure in the world at the time of its completion. in 2010, samsung delivered the burj khalifa in dubai, which is currently the tallest building in the world at 828m and 163 storeys high. meanwhile, wct has a strong partner in arabtec. arabtec, samsung and belgiums besix were the key players that built the burj

buildings  it does have the experience. and its partner [china state construction engineering] is a us$45 billion company u2026 so they cannot be taken lightly, one source says. it is also noteworthy that mrcb is 38.4% controlled by the epf. for the year ended december 2014, mrcb reported rm152.6 million in net profit from rm1.5 billion in revenue. as at the end of last year, mrcb had deposits,

nevertheless, tsrs partner  south koreas daewoo group  is one of the largest conglomerates in asia. daewoo engineering & construction co ltd has a market capitalisation of almost us$3 billion. seacera, at its close of 79 sen last thursday, had a market capitalisation of rm143.3 million. seaceras partner and 60% unit, spaz, is also relatively small, but the strength of its bid comes from its chinese partner, sinohydro corp-shanghai construction group. seacera last october concluded the acquisition of 60% of spaz for rm3 million. the other 40% is held by mohd azami idris via his vehicle actual capital sdn bhd. spaz posted after tax profits of rm72,660 from rm36.9 million in revenue for the financial year ended december 2014. it is noteworthy that seaceras partnership with the chinese party was sealed in may last year in beijing, during premier datuk seri najib razaks visit to china. nevertheless, for the smaller companies, the payment of the performance bond  amounting to 5% of the construction cost  could be problematic. if the construction portion is rm3 billion, as stated in news reports, the performance bond could amount to rm150 million, which may deter some of the

as the leading domestic integrated electricity transmission player. some near-term prospects for sarawak cable include: (i) tnbs (tenaga nasional bhd's) tenders for cable supply for distribution lines amounting to ~rm1.2 billion; (ii) underground cables for 132kv lines in petra jaya; and (iii) tnbs 500kv overhead transmission lines. meanwhile, hsl is said to be a strong contender for work packages of the pan borneo highway, given its expertise in land reclamation jobs. hsl is also tipped to secure the second phase of the kuching central sewerage system, which will be worth at least ~rm500 million. it had in 1q15 completed the first phase, which was worth rm452 million, soon said. kkb will benefit from government expenditure in rural development. soon said this would involve steel pipe supply for water projects there. but analysts have also noted kkb's oil and gas (o&g) related ventures, which are deemed crucial earnings growth factors for the company. kkbs earnings profile is anticipated to change significantly, given its foray into o&g support services via 42%-owned associate and petronas-licensed services provider oceanmight sdn bhd, soon said.

roofing player sets realistic goal for itself", "article": " ns bluescope lysaght malaysia sdn bhd, the countrys largest metal roofing and walling player with a 20% share in the mid-range and high-end markets, is targeting revenue growth of 5% in its financial year ending june 30, 2015 (fy2015), in line with the countrys forecast gross domestic product (gdp) growth rate. according to president ng say teck, the company generated revenue of rm120 million in fy2014, up 7% from fy2013. acknowledging that 5% revenue growth is not an ambitious goal, he says it is realistic for the group, given the market uncertainties caused by falling oil prices. the slower growth in fy2015 will be due to a slowdown in the property market, a pullback in capital expenditure due to a collapse in oil prices and the scaling down of expansion plans by industry players, ng tells the edge. established in1968, ns bluescope lysaght malaysia is a pioneer in the manufacture of steel-making products in the country. its product range includes roofing and walling, roof trusses and building structures. the company is a 60:40 joint venture between ns bluescope lysaght singapore pte ltd and singapore-listed united engineers ltd (uel). to recap, bluescope lysaght (m) sdn bhd was incorporated in malaysia in 1968 and was initially known as john lysaght. the company was renamed nsbluescope lysaght malaysia in 2012 after nippon steel sumitomo metal corp of japan came into the picture as a joint-venture partner. there is no connection between ns bluescope lysaght malaysia and public listed lysaght galvanized steel bhd (lgs). however, it is worth noting that uel is a common shareholder of ns bluescope lysaght malaysia and lgs as the singapore company has an 11.63% stake in lysaght (m) sdn bhd, the controlling shareholder of lgs with a 55.14% stake. ns bluescope lysaght malaysia has manufacturing operations in kota kinabalu, bintulu, kuching and shah alam with a combined capacity to produce close to 20,000 tonnes per annum of roofing and walling materials. at the moment, we have adequate production capacity for our existing product range. plans are underway to invest in capacity to manufacture new innovative products in the coming financial years, says ng, adding that the company will allocate 2% to 3% of its revenue to r&d every year. he also highlights the governments announcement in the revised budget 2015 that the development expenditure of rm48.5 billion for the year will be maintained and spent. ns bluescope lysaght malaysia is expected to benefit from the spillovers from mega-infrastructure projects, such as the mass rapid transit (mrt), light rail transit (lrt) extension and west coast expressway. meanwhile, the weakening ringgit should boost the export activities of local manufacturers. thus, ns bluescope lysaght malaysia, which also serves clients in the industrial sector, will be able to supply more products. local exporters are expected to undertake factory expansion, which means rising demand for our products, says ng. the companys roofing and walling segment contributes about 80% to revenue while the remaining 20% comes from structural products. ng says traditionally, residential projects use mainly concrete or clay tiles, but the use of metal roofing is gaining traction, especially in the medium to high-end developments with contemporary designs, such as lower pitch roofs that is possible only with metal roofing. we are well known in the project market as our clients are mainly construction firms and property developers. ns bluescope lysaght malaysia was involved in some of the countrys landmark projects, such as the petronas twin towers, the kuching airport, lrt phase 2, curtin university, hersheys confectionery plant and the national cancer institute. our differentiation comes from fully tested product performance and stringent quality control and procedures, offering total peace of mind to loyal global clientele, such as coca-cola, toyota and nestlu00e9, ng says. moving forward, ns bluescope lysaght malaysia will be seeking growth in the retail market by launching new products as it expects a weak consumer spending pattern and slowdown in the building industry. in the next two to three years, we want to explore the retail market, which, in our view, is a potential growth area. we want to provide a one-stop centre for roofing solutions to end-users, ng comments. he believes with an enhanced service-based and total solution philosophy, coupled with a strategic alliance with nippon steel and access to the capacity and resources of sister companies in the region, ns bluescope lysaght malaysia will continue to stay relevant to its customers.  note: the edge researchs

a good year for malaysian employees, who saw above-average increments and bonuses, while robust recruitment throughout the year offered many opportunities for job hoppers vying for better pay. but on the back of several high-profile layoffs late last year and early this year, 2015 might not be such a good year. consumer sentiment is cautious, the property market is softening, interest rates are up, the stock market is down and the economic outlook as a whole simply isnt as bullish. and when businesses lose confidence, salaries and hiring tend to slow down too. in such an environment, what can malaysian workers expect from the job market this year? a good year actually, but only if you are a skilled professional in the mid-to-top level of your field, say the countrys top recruiters. we genuinely do not see any evidence of a slowdown at all for the skilled workforce from the mid to senior level, not even within oil and gas. the need for local skilled individuals is as high as ever, says hays specialist recruitment (malaysia) ltd country manager tom osborne. osbornes focus,however, is on the mid to high end of the job market where hays operates. at the lower end, there has been a steady stream of news that has driven concern about a softening job market  nothing that will see unemployment rise, but slower wage growth and possibly fewer opportunities. compared with 2014, more employers say they will be hiring less this year, while fewer employers say they will be hiring more this year. as a lead indicator, it suggests that confidence of the market is weaker, but that doesnt mean it will be a bad year. 2014 was a very good year for us, says jobstreet country manager chook yuh yng. she points out that postings on the recruitment site have not shown any signs of slowing down in january. however, listings in march, the peak recruitment period, will be more telling of 2015s outlook. jobstreet primarily covers white-collar recruitment ads from entry to mid-level positions. the companys survey in late 2014 shows only 37% of managers plan to hire more staff this year, compared with 49% in 2014. at the same time, 24% of survey takers said they would be hiring less this year, compared with 14% in 2014 (see employers planning to hire less below). it doesnt help that one of the countrys largest employers, malaysian airline system bhd, is in the midst of trimming 6,000 staff from its 20,000 strong headcount. even if most of the staff are reskilled and redeployed among other companies, it would still soak up a large number of vacancies. while one could argue that mass layoffs could have been expected, it came as a surprise when standard chartered bank announced the shutdown of its equities business in asia resulting in 11% of its malaysian workforce being laid off. not long after, cimb group holdings bhd announced that it would be closing its australian investment banking business. it may not be local, but the bank will have a number of australia-based staff to redeploy locally. adding to the concern, there has been talk in the market of voluntary separation schemes being undertaken in some of the big local banks. strangely enough, financial services had been one of the most aggressive sectors in hiring last year. according to chook, jobstreet saw a 27% increase in recruitment ads for positions in banking and financial services in 2014, making it the fastest growing sector in terms of recruitment. it is also the second largest sector by jobstreet recruitment ads (see top five job postings by industry). there might be some slowdown at the investment banking and equities level, but that only makes a small portion of recruitment in financial services. commercial and retail banking continues to do well, and there continues to be high demand for front office, revenue-generating positions, says sally raj, managing director of robert walters malaysia, a professional recruitment consultancy. it is not going to be a hunky-dory year. there is a lot of perceived negativity in the market and there are industries that will face a dip. but there is not going to be a complete downturn, adds sally. meanwhile, the fall in crude oil prices to less than us$50 a barrel in the past few months also puts the oil and gas (o&g) sector in the limelight. upstream operations that have on- going long-term supply contracts should not be substantially affected but the o&g service and support businesses are expecting a slowdown. after all, the countrys largest employer in the sector, petroliam nasional bhd (petronas), plans to slash capital expenditure and operational expenditure by up to 15%, and between 25% and 30%, respectively, this year. we dont cover the technical o&g, in relation to drilling engineers and rotation engineers. but based on the cvs that we have received, there are a lot of these people approaching us now for jobs. their contracts have ended prematurely or their rates have come down, notes sally. although he has observed some retrenchment in malaysia, hays osborne maintains that the skills shortage in the industry remains, especially for highly specialised and senior roles. the downturn in oil prices does not have an immediate effect on salaries. however the longer the oil price stays low, the greater the impact will be on overall staffing demand, which will ultimately impact salaries as competition for jobs increases, he adds. nonetheless, malaysian salaries remained relatively competitive in terms of increments, when compared with the region. according to a survey by hays, 40% of malaysians received an increment of more than 6% last year, compared with the 29% average across countries like china, hong kong, japan and singapore. looking ahead, even more employees are expected to get increments exceeding 6%. forty-three per cent of malaysian companies surveyed plan to hand out increments of more than 6%. in comparison, the average among countries surveyed was only 30% (see salary increases below). divergence within job market at the lower end of the job market however, jobstreets survey paints a slightly different picture, with less bonuses planned for this year as well as smaller than expected increments. the survey shows that employers only plan to reward about 31% of employees with a bonus of two months or more this year. in comparison, 35% of staff were rewarded with bonuses exceeding two months last year. employees are also expecting bigger increments than employers are willing to give, notes chook. according to the survey, employers are only planning to give 31% of staff an increment exceeding 6%. however, over 54% of employees are expecting such a raise. in a nutshell, it will continue to be an employees market for highly skilled professionals and specialists. meanwhile, the lower end of the job market may see slower hiring and smaller increments. this is not unusual. it is something we see in many countries. companies are willing to pay a high premium for skilled and experienced employees because there is a huge skills shortage, says hays managing director christine wright. as malaysias economy grows and businesses grow, it creates new roles and increases vacancies. businesses then need to compete for talent. it is a trend we have seen in other developing economies, she explains. on the other hand, companies are not willing to pay a high price for candidates without experience, since the firms are basically paying for soft skills  the candidates potential to develop, she adds. nonetheless, graduates tend to have very high expectations, says chook. on average, graduates pay is about rm2,100 a month. while this isnt very high, it has been increasing over the years. however, the graduates on average are expecting to be paid rm3,500. this is a very large gap and it needs to be lowered, she says. poaching vs developing according to a robert walters report, employees can expect from 22% to as high as 30% increments when they change jobs, particularly those who have the right skills and experience. this is largely due to the shortage of talent to fill the ever-growing number of mid to high-level vacancies. so, what about candidates who lack the skills? at the moment, companies would rather pay cash for people with the right skills than invest the resources to develop these candidates themselves. however, as the skills gap continues to grow, this will change, says wright. companies need to invest in developing their employees to fill their vacancies and retain staff. employees need to see an upward career trajectory and want to be part of a company that is growing, she says. in fact, lack of career development is the main reason why three quarters of respondents were unhappy with their current jobs, according to the jobstreet survey. only 45.6% of respondents see themselves staying with the company for less than one year while 36% would likely leave after three years. lack of career growth was the main reason cited. multinational companies are ahead of local businesses in people development, osborne says, i think that is recognised internally and within the local businesses. they are making strides to gear up to that level of standard. the candidates are aware of that as well. if local companies divert more resources into developing talent instead of poaching it from rivals, it would certainly narrow the skills gap in the country, adds wright. however, the government and industry would have to work closely with educational institutions to make sure the right skills are being developed for the workforce of the future. companies will always want someone who can meet the job description, 10/10. but most of the time, the candidates are only a 6/10 or 7/10. the question is whether these candidates have the soft skills, the potential to be developed into a 10/10, says osborne. malaysians traditionally travel very well throughout the world. they are very diverse in their soft skills. when exposed to lots of different situations, when they need to use their soft skills, they do excel, he adds.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia

year, which kick-started its drilling business. the vietnam blocks will lift sapurakencanas production to almost 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (kboepd) from 23kbpoed from newfield malaysias assets. we are keeping our earnings per share (eps) forecast for financial year 2015 ending this january (fy15) and fy16 at the moment as the vietnam transaction is expected to be completed next year with earnings pouring in after that. despite the slump in share price recently, sapurakencanas fundamentals remain strong and are backed by a huge order book of rm26.1 billion with extension options worth rm19.1 billion. we reiterate our buy call at a tp of rm5.13 (previously rm6.03) as we remove the valuation premium over the industry price-earnings ratio (per) following the lower oil price. our target price is based on fy16 eps forecast of 25.7 sen and lower industry per of 20 times. we continue to favour the stock.  jf apex research, nov 21  this article first appeared in the edge financial

bhd is strategising a move to expand its marine business. the group is in the midst of finalising three collaborative agreements with a london-based safety and survival equipment manufacturer. its subsidiary vanguard composite engineering pte ltd will have access to an enlarged pool of customers globally, according to a source familiar with the company. the first agreement will provide vanguard with a distribution channel for its lifeboats and lifeboat hooks in europe, the us and africa. vanguard currently has a presence in asia-pacific, australia, europe, the middle east and the americas. \"this will strengthen vanguards foothold in existing markets and expand its reach on a global scale as it will now be able to increase the supply of its products overseas. this will also expand the groups revenue base, says the source. he adds: \"on average, vanguard supplies 100 lifeboats a year. which translates into revenue of s$15 million (rm38.6 million). with the collaboration with the foreign company, it may see an additional 30 to 40 lifeboats a year, which will add s$4 million to s$5 million to its revenue. to recap, destini acquired a 51% stake in singapore-based vanguard for rm10 million in 2012. currently, destini is planning to buy out the remaining 49% stake in vanguard for rm26 million by year-end. the equity interest is presently held by a singaporean businessman ng tuck whye. the source reveals that destinis new partner will be working with its two other wholly-owned subsidiaries, destini prima sdn bhd and tf corp pte ltd, which are part of its marine division, on an agreement. this second agreement will give destini the right to distribute and maintain the london-based firms liferafts for commercial use in malaysia, he says. currently, destini is only authorised to distribute and maintain life rafts for the countrys defence sector. once the agreement is inked  expected to be by end-month  the group will be able to distribute and maintain life rafts for the oil and gas and shipping industries as well. this will open up destinis life raft market within malaysia. the group will, later on, be able to distribute life rafts commercially to shipping companies and petroliam nasional bhds (petronas) oil platforms, says the source. the third agreement will see the london-based firm referring its clients to singapore-based tf corp for the maintenance of lifeboats and other life-saving equipment. this is expected to increase the groups marine maintenance, repair and overhaul (mro) activities. note that destini has three main business segments. the marine division contributes 30% to the groups revenue while another 30% comes from its aviation mro division, which is awaiting certification by the european aviation safety agency to enable destini to secure commercial aviation jobs. the remaining 40% is derived from its oil and gas division, which is led by samudra oil services sdn bhd. it was acquired by the group for rm80 million earlier this year. samudra oil is one of the groups main earnings contributors, as reflected in destinis 2qfy2014 net profit, which more than doubled to rm1.23 million from rm514,000 in the previous corresponding period. revenue was also higher at rm36.81 million from rm22.73 million. for the first half of the year, the group saw a net profit of rm4.31 million as compared with rm2.92 million previously, on the back of a revenue of rm65.88 million, from rm39.07 million previously. since it has been lifted from pn17 classification, destinis share price has been on an uptrend, reaching a five-year high of 74 sen on june 30 this year. this represents a 128% jump from the one-year low of 32.5 sen on oct 22 last year. the stock closed at 50 sen last thursday. uob kay hian initiated coverage on destini on june 16 with a buy call and a target price of 87 sen, which implies a fy2015 forecast price earnings ratio (per) of 13.2 times. our valuation has taken into account the enlarged share base due to the issuance of warrants and new shares for the vanguard acquisition. our target price implies an upside of 32.8% from its current share price, it says. uob forecasts that destinis earnings will leap fourfold in fy2014, underpinned by a nine-month earnings contribution from samudra oil and full-year earnings contributions from tf corp and vanguard. for fy2015, our projected earnings growth of 59% took into account the full-year contribution from samudra oils tubular handling business and the respective earnings growth of 10% and 62% from the marine and aviation mro businesses, uob adds. this

strengthen its position in the upstream oil and gas industry, barakah offshore petroleum bhd has set its sights on developing marginal oilfields, say sources familiar with the company. given its expanding order book, some strategic investors, including felda investment corp (fic), are keen to acquire a substantial stake in barakah, which made its debut on bursa malaysia last year through a reverse takeover. according to sources, barakah is conducting studies on local marginal oilfields to form a cluster for development. it is part of the groups plan to strengthen its presence in the exploration and production segment, says an industry executive, who also notes that barakah, which prefers proven oilfields, has yet to narrow them down. barakahs officials were not contactable at press time to shed light on the matter. the company has to look at the strength of its balance sheet and risk profile of the assets first before finalising any investment, says the industry executive. should its venture into marginal oilfield development materialise, barakah will need fresh capital. it is learnt that several interested parties have approached the company for a substantial stake. so far, fic has entered into talks with the company. established as an investment arm of the federal land development authority, fic undertakes business activities that are not plantation-related. if it successfully acquires equity interest in barakah, it would be fics first investment in the oil and gas industry. but there is no concrete decision as yet on bringing in a strategic investor mainly because the controlling shareholders believe the market price is undervalued, says a source familiar with the company. barakahs shares have been on a downward trend lately, declining nearly 27% from a peak of rm1.87 in february to rm1.37 last thursday. net profit in its second quarter ended june 30 tripled to rm12.34 million from the previous corresponding period while revenue surged to rm159.7 million from rm57.71 million. cash reserves stood at rm145.58 million as at june 30 while short-term borrowings amounted to rm30.46 million. the steep rise in earnings was mainly due to the completion of a topside installation job for kebabangan petroleum operating co (kpoc) in sabah, the start of its pan-malaysia transport and installation contract and other construction activities carried out during the quarter. kpoc is a joint-venture company created for the development and production-sharing contract for the kebabangan gas field off sabah by petronas carigali sdn bhd (40%), conocophillips sabah gas ltd (30%) and shell energy asia ltd (30%). kenanga research expects barakahs profit recognition to pick up in the second half of the year on the back of higher installation and construction activity and the execution of the t&i contract. last year, barakah was awarded a contract worth an estimated rm1.5 billion by various oil and gas production-sharing companies for the transport and installation of facilities in malaysias offshore fields. the contract is for three years with an extension option for another year for facilities under petroliam nasional bhds pan-malaysia project. it is worth noting that in the last 10 months alone, barakah managed to secure four jobs  the rm260 million procurement, construction and commissioning of pipelines job for the pengerang integrated complex by petronas gas bhd; the hook-up, commissioning and topside major maintenance job for lundin malaysia b.v.; the rm29 million engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning job for petronas dagangan bhds biodiesel storage and blending facilities in miri; and a pre-commissioning services job for a pipeline in terengganu from gom resources sdn bhd. according to kenanga research, the first work order from lundin is worth rm30 million and is for six months. the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation margin for the contract could be between 20% and 22%. the contract period is from aug 14, 2014, to feb 4, 2016. excluding the tender book for the arab saudi project, we understand that barakah is actively bidding for rm400 million to rm600 million worth of projects, says the research house, adding that barakahs order book of rm2.3 billion provides earnings visibility for the next three years. most analysts who track the stock have pegged to it a fair value that is at least 20% higher than its closing price of rm1.37 last thursday. the target prices range from rm1.73 to rm1.95. uob kay hian has the highest target price among five research houses. its valuations are pegged at 14 times fully diluted earnings with its forecast earnings per share at 13.3 sen for fy2015 ending dec 31. our target price-to-earnings ratio is conservative as it is at a 15% discount to the sectors 16.5 times. we believe a re-rating could take place if the company is able to execute its order book. assuming the stock re-rates to the sector

the award of new tenders translate to cuts in o&g players revenue prospects in fy15f-fy16 and a higher corresponding impact on earnings leveraged to fixed operating costs, it said. amresearch, however, said the impact would be more significant for domestic-centric upstream players, as opposed to more globalised operators such as bumi armada and sapurakencana or downstream service providers

growth assumption downwards to 2% in fy14 from 5% which was too optimistic, considering the recent developments.  we still believe that aaxs yields will rise slightly in fy14 due to the withdrawal of the poor-yielding maldives route that had affected yields in 4qfy13 and improvement in its jeddah yields as travel demand normalises. we expect aaxs yields to increase by 5% in fy15 following its relocation to klia2.  cypark resources bhd target price: rm3.09 add cimb research (march 31): revenue growth for 1qf14 was flattish as it only grew by 1% to rm51.5 million. this was due to lower revenue from its environmental engineering that declined by 3.6%, but was balanced out by landscaping and renewable energy (re) for which revenues grew by 66% and 72% respectively.  we had previously highlighted that the sustainable energy development authority (seda) was expected to release its new re quota under the feed-in-tariff programme (fit) by the end of march. however, news reports suggest that the new quota is only expected by april. cypark is aiming for at least another 10mw of new re quota from seda. 1malaysia development bhds move (1mdb) to be the first to build a solar power plant outside of the fit quota is positive for cypark, as this means that it too can propose a similar project, given its current status as the largest re player in malaysia. a mega solar farm such as 1mdbs 50mw would almost double cyparks end-fy14 re capacity target of 50mw.petronas gas bhdtarget price: rm21.98 neutral rhb research (april 1): petronas gas (petgas) has entered into a new 20-year gas sale agreement with petronas, effective today until dec 31, 2033, for the following: a gas-processing agreement (gpa), a gas-transportation agreement (gta) comprising gta peninsular malaysia, gta sabah and gta sarawak and an agent services agreement. the new gpa includes gta sabah for the additional gas transport services provided to petronas for its customers in kimanis that started in january 2014. the new agreements allow for a revision to the remuneration terms prior to the expiry of each five-year term: i) first term  april 1, 2014 to dec 31, 2018; ii) second term  jan 1, 2019 to dec 31, 2023; iii) third term  jan 1, 2024 to dec 31, 2028; and iv) fourth term  jan 1, 2029 to dec 31, 2033. we keep our fy14/fy15 earnings estimates as the changes in agreement terms are not significant to compel forecast revisions. we maintain neutral on this stock with an unchanged sop-based future value of rm1.98.  jt international bhdtarget price: rm7.80 buy affin investment bank (april 1): in a march 31 bursa announcement, jt international holdings, the majority shareholder of jti malaysia, has made a buyout offer of rm808.5 million for the remaining 39.6% stake of jti.  we are pleasantly surprised by the privatisation offer price, which is significantly higher than our previous dividend-discount-model- (ddm) derived target price of rm6. in addition to the offer price, this represents a 20% premium to jtis pre-suspension price and a 21% premium to jtis six-month volume weighted average price trading of shares. at rm7.80 per share, jti is being valued at a 15 times fy15 2015 estimation eps and a cy14 estimation per-nta of 5.7 times as at end-december 2013.  in view of the challenging prospects for the tobacco industry and the strong offer on hand, we think that there is no reason for minorities to reject the deal. while we upgrade the stock to buy and raise our ddm-based target to rm7.80, we expect the stock to trade near its offer price upon re-quotation.  astro malaysia holdings bhdtarget price: rm3.60 buy hwangdbs vickers research (april 1): astro malaysia holdings fy14 earnings of rm448 million is within our and consensus expectations at 96% and 98% of respective earnings estimates.  astro will continue to enjoy average revenue per user uplift from improving take-up of b.yond hd channels as well as full-year recognition of package price increases. this would also be bolstered by full-year recognition of revenue from astros barclays premier league channel-supply partnership with telekom malaysia bhd. margins are expected to be resilient as its set-up box swap-out exercise eases and depreciation tapers off in the longer term. its share of advertising expenditure in the overall market is also steadily rising, which will add to its strong subscription revenue. the stock offers bright earnings growth prospects in a fairly defensive market, and could surprise on the back of utilisation of new transponder capacity through its satellite launch, which is expected in 2q14.  eastern & oriental bhdfair value: rm3 buy amresearch (april 3): we reaffirm our buy recommendation on eastern & oriental (e&o) with an unchanged fair value of rm3 per share  a 35% discount to our nav of rm4.61 per share, including the significant accretion from seri tanjung pinang 2 (stp2).  a local daily reported that e&os share price has risen to reflect the progress in stp2 and the timeline of events of its stp project. our key investment thesis on e&o is centred on the crystallisation of stp2 given the tripling of nav and the deep development potential of the 760-acre prime land. e&o is awaiting the department of environments approval for the detailed environment impact assessment study on the commencement of reclamation works on stp2. we recommend that investors accumulate e&o ahead of the sustained news flow momentum as stp2 moves closer to realisation. this may lead to a narrowing of the current nav discount of 52% via an accelerated share price discovery of its fair value.padini holdings bhdtarget price: rm2.40 buy hwang dbs vickers research (april 3): padini plans to open three brands outlet (bo) and two padini concept stores (pcs) before end-june. this will add 40,000 sq ft to 50,000 sq ft of floor area to take total new area to 96,000 sq ft to 120,000 sq ft in fy14. going forward, padini wants to open at least five outlets a year. we raised fy15 to fy16 forecast eps by 3% to 8% after imputing larger earnings contribution from bo and pcs. the near-term earnings growth driver will likely be bo. bo focuses on offering a wide variety of value-for-money products targeted at the low- to middle-income consumers. we believe bo margins are higher given fitting cost is 45% lower than pcs. bo has an impressive track record with five-year pbt cagr of 118%. bo contributed 25% of fy13 revenue. current valuation is attractive at 11 times fy15 eps given the resilient earnings, continuous expansion plans, 25% return on equity and a strong balance sheet. dividends could surprise as expanding bo generally requires lower capital expenditure and costs. our 70% payout ratio for fy14f implies 5% yield. sentoria group bhdtarget price: rm1.20 buy ta securities (april 2): last year was eventful for sentoria group as it has proposed two massive integrated resort cities in morib and kuching. the group should see busy years ahead given that bandar samariang and morib bay will commence in 2014 and 2015 respectively. we like sentorias synergistic business model, which allows it to enjoy earnings upside from property development and at the same time, benefit from its strong cash-generating leisure and hospitality business.  sentoria is operating in two business divisions, namely property development and leisure and hospitality. the group has around 1,500 acres of undeveloped landbank with an estimated gross development value of rm6.6 billion. the groups leisure and hospitality operation consists of two theme parks and two resorts within bukit gambang resort city. our target price is at a 38% discount to the groups fully-diluted rnav of rm1.95 per share. there could be further upside to rnav as we have conservatively assumed a 70% take-up rate for properties in morib bay rc and borneo samariang rc.sapurakencana petroleum bhdtarget price: rm5.36 buy midf research (april 2): sapurakencana petroleum has bagged one fresh contract and three contract extensions. the newly secured jobs are worth a collective us$454 million. although we have factored in these potential job wins, we are taking this opportunity to adjust our fy15 earnings estimates slightly higher by 2.4%. we are assuming lower financing costs from the recently undertaken debt restructuring exercise and also a higher fleet utilisation rate of over 65%. sapurakencanas order book remains strong at us$8.3 billion. broken down geographically, 49% of the jobs are from brazil, 31% from malaysia, 14% from southeast asia, 5% from australia and the rest from africa. tender book value is almost similar to the current order book at rm25 billion.we are still bullish on sapurakencana and we are reiterating our buy recommendation at a revised target price of rm5.36 per share. this is based on fy15 eps of 23.3 sen, pegged to fy15 per of 23 times. our target per is a slight premium to our large-cap sector per of 20 times. uzma bhdtarget price: rm7.30 outperform kenanga research (april 2): uzma and its partner eq petroleum developments malaysia sdn bhd announced that they have signed a small field risk service contract (sfrsc) with petroliam nasional bhd to carry out the development and production of petroleum from the tanjung baram fields for a period of nine years.  the development phase of the entire sfrsc is expected to cost us$100 million and first oil is anticipated in 2015. eq petroleum developments has a 70% stake whilst uzma has a 30% stake in the venture. assuming a 80:20 equity-to-debt ratio; 6% cost of debt and 15 % internal rate of return, we believe uzmas 30% stake will yield accretive earnings of rm5.2 million in fy15. our new target price is rm7.30 is based on an unchanged targeted fy15 per of 16 times. our per is justifiable given that the stock has successfully moved up the value chain instead of just being a service provider. as its share base is pretty illiquid, the share price gains can be significant. this story first appeared in the edge weekly edition of april 07-13, 2014."}, "40": {"date_posted": "14/4/2014", "title": "hot

17): 2014\nis expected to be a good year for the local stock market, according to affin\ninvestment bank vice president and head of retail research dr nazri khan.  he said affin ib research\nhad a 2014 year end target of 1,980 for the fbm klci, representing a 7.4%\nupside and a 12.4% gain for investors, adding that the fbm klci was valued at\n16 times pe.  speaking to the media here\nyesterday in conjunction with the soft launch of the malaysian association of\ntechnical analysts (mata), he added the factors that would support his\nhypothesis was the fact that the us economy had the best growth in five years,\nand that europe was also beginning to show firmer improvement.  nazri, who is also the\npresident of mata, said the association now had 50 members and was targeting to\nhave at least 300 members by next year. on the local front, nazri\nsaid that in 2014 there were no political issues like elections that could\ncause investor unrest; execution of the economic transformation programme (etp)\nthat was better than expected; and a catalystic johor corridor that would see\nbetter performance for property- and oil & gas-related stocks.  nazri said the two main\nsectors that investors should take serious note in 2014 were the oil and gas as\nwell as the technology sector.  he said that for the oil and\ngas sector, national oil firm petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) had taken the\nlead with the rm60 billion pengerang project, from which local oil and gas\nplayers would benefit most.  dr mohd nazri khan nazri said during the early\npart of this year, oil and gas-related penny stocks had been performing well,\nadding this trend was set to continue. he said another factor that\naugurs well for the local stock market was the slew of mega initial public\nofferings (ipos) that had been scheduled for 2014, which he estimated would\nhave a total capitalisation in excess of us$8.1 billion.  2013 was a quiet year in\nterms of mega ipos, unlike in 2012. this year will be better than 2012, he\nsaid. nazri said he expects another good year this year with at least 15 ipos floated on the exchange, thus exceeding 2012 offerings.he stressed that last year, bursa malaysia handled only us$4 billion ipos and us$7 billion in 2012.nazri added that the\nemployees provident fund (epf), lembaga tabung angkatan tentera (ltat) and\nkumpulan wang persaraan (kwap) were ready and able to subscribe shares in the\nmega ipos, stressing that the funds had ample liquidity to mop up the shares.  on the continuous outflow of\nforeign funds from local equities, nazri said it was a not serious anomaly and\nwas prevalent in most regional markets.  we see this as a\nnormalization of hot money flowing out. there are signs that the local\ninstitutional investors have been able to absorb the shares, he said.  nazri said the current trend\nof the local stock market mirrored bursa malaysias bull run in the early\n1990s, which lasted four years.  we expect the bull run now\nat least till july 2019, he said.

council (mtem) on petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) to grant contracts to local companies rather than foreign companies will not dampen the oil & gas (o&g) sector outlook this year, said maybank kim eng research pte ltd. last week the coalition of malay non-governmental organisations called for the resignation of tan sri shamsul azhar abas, petronas ceo and president, if he could not look after the interest of bumiputera companies. speaking at a conference on the years outlook on saturday, maybanks executive director of research ong seng yeow said the focus would be on petronas budget of rm300 billion allocated for five years from 2011 to 2015. i do not think this issue will dampen the outlook for the o&g sector. we have to remember that the rm300 billion budget petronas allocated for capital expenditure has two years left, said ong during the weekend conference. he highlighted: they [petronas] have already utilised 50% of the allocated budget. they have to utilise the remainder of the budget. so, we are bullish on the visibility of future contracts. ong also noted petronas has been committing more of its firepower into the rapid (refinery and petrochemical integrated development) project in pengerang, johor and the sabah ammonia urea (samur) project. ong said the o&g sector should be assessed via its underlying fundamentals that are driving demand in the sector, noting that oil price is not the big draw. the o&g upstream segment looks very appealing to us, he said. drilling activities have been on the rise. rig utilisation levels are back to the pre-crisis levels. the charter day-to-day rates, consequently, are on the rise too as well as the offshore support vessel (osv). he pointed out the o&g sector is very liquid and is drawing institutional interest. our top pick for the sector is bumi armada bhd given it is a direct proxy to the floating production storage and offloading (fpso) market. the company is expecting to bag new fpso contracts this year, said ong. another o&g firm to watch is sapurakencana petroleum bhd, he pointed out. he added that funds around the globe are paying attention to the stock given the firm is the largest tender sea drill operator in the world. sapurakencana had secured petronas pan malaysia integrated hook-up & commissioning and topside major maintenance contract. this is significant, said ong. furthermore, ong said alam maritim resources bhd, barakah offshore petroleum bhd and perdana petroleum bhd are mid-cap stocks to watch given their higher re-rating potential. according to bloomberg data, bumi armada trades at a price earnings ratio (per) of 25.86 times while sapurakencana trades at per of 31.15 times. this compares to the fbm klcis per of 17.62 times. alam maritim, barakah and
