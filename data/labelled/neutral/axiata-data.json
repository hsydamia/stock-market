corporate malaysia? apparently not, new research by a renowned academic shows, because the government controls a significant portion of it. this may not be immediately obvious but if one considers the sheer weight of involvement by government-linked companies (glcs) and government-linked investment companies (glics) in the malaysian economy over the decades, it becomes plausible. in his recent research, universiti malaya academic professor dr edmund terence gomez found that control of the corporate sector is concentrated in the hands of the executive, specifically the prime minister, who is also the finance minister. gomez arrived at this conclusion in his research of the complex web of control and ownership of malaysias economy after examining the shareholding structure of seven federal glics  minister of finance inc (mof inc), khazanah nasional bhd, permodalan nasional bhd, the employees provident fund, lembaga tabung angkatan tentera, lembaga tabung haji and kumpulan wang persaraan (kwap)  and their investments. according to gomez, the finance minister holds a powerful position as he oversees mof inc, which controls a vast empire of companies in strategic sectors, including utility, oil and gas, infrastructure and development finance. as minister of finance, he controls mof inc. it is a super entity at the top of the core periphery structure, he says. what this means is that the government can exert a strong influence on glics and glcs when it comes to major commercial decisions, including the award of contracts, key appointments, corporate strategy, financing, asset acquisitions and sales. gomezs research outlines seven broad mechanisms via which the government controls the glics: legislation, business groups and interlocking stock ownership, control of the financial sector, policies, directorships, golden shares and proxies. he says this is phenomenal because the glics hold sway over some rm1 trillion worth of investments. according to his research, the seven glics control 35 of the top 100 listed companies in malaysia whose combined market capitalisation accounts for 42% of the market cap of all the listed companies on bursa malaysia. many of these companies operate in key sectors of the economy, such as utilities, infrastructure, property and telecommunications. for example, some mof incs key assets and investments include petroliam nasional bhd, khazanah nasional, uda holdings bhd, keretapi tanah melayu bhd, mrt corp sdn bhd, syarikat prasarana negara bhd, src international sdn bhd as well as several development financial institutions. khazanah nasionals investments meanwhile include cimb group bhd, uem group bhd, plus malaysia bhd, iskandar investment bhd, tenaga nasional bhd, axiata group bhd, telekom malaysia bhd, time dotcom bhd, ihh healthcare bhd, astro malaysia holdings bhd, malaysia airports holdings and malaysia airlines bhd. the analysis also shows that the seven glics have interests in 427 high-value companies either via subsidiary, associate or minority stakes. ten levels down, the glics have exposure to 6,342 companies, and this is just taking into consideration the shareholding of the seven glics, their listed companies and their subsidiaries and associates. the analysis at this stage does not include state glics. this marks a big departure from corporate control seen in past decades, under past prime ministers, that largely placed control of a huge asset base in the hands of umno-linked proxies and umno leaders. who owns corporate malaysia today? we had a time when there was a fragmented umno, when there were many umno leaders who had a key presence in the corporate sector. they were a source of patronage. they were powerful people who had interests in the corporate sector. but this is not the case today. now you see a well-integrated executive controlling the corporate sector, says gomez in a recent public lecture entitled who owns corporate malaysia now? ownership and control of glics. he argues that this new shift has put extreme concentration of economic and political control in the hands of the prime minister. the story of corporate malaysias evolution from a post-independence nation to the present day is not purely one of private enterprise and capitalist endeavours. there are other important, interconnected dynamics at play as well, including economic and social policies and politics. the professor recalls a time in the 1990s which saw the rise of a bumiputera capitalist class that was closely aligned with umno leaders. this was during the era of tun dr mahathir mohamad, tun daim zainuddin and datuk seri anwar ibrahim. in tracing the broad history of control over the malaysian economy, gomez says the 1970s saw a transition from extensive ownership by foreign interests post-independence to the ascendancy of government-owned enterprises in the 1980s. and when dr mahathir became prime minister in 1981, he took malaysia in a completely different direction by going for privatisation and liberalisation with a view of creating a pool of bumiputera corporate titans, says gomez. but the plan fell apart around 1997 at the time of the asian financial crisis. during tun abdullah ahmad badawis administration, the malay capitalist influence on the economy declined and there was a resurgence of glic dominance, gomez points out. so, is government over-intervention a necessary evil or of strategic importance to the malaysian economy? this has been hotly debated and opinions span the spectrum, from those who favour a free market economy where the government is not directly involved in business to those who favour state intervention in strategic sectors. private-sector entrepreneurs have long bemoaned the presence of the glcs, which some allege have an unfair advantage when it comes to accessing government contracts, financing and policies. at this point of their research, gomez and his team have yet to address the outcomes and impact of the glcs and glics on the malaysian economy. this trend of the governments overbearing influence runs contrary to prime minister datuk seri najib razaks earlier pledge that the government will divest the glcs so that the private sector can return to the driving seat of the economy. indeed, the government has commenced a plan to divest its interest in some glcs, either via paring down its stakes, public listing of companies or outright sales. but the slow pace of the divestments calls into question the governments sincerity in reducing its direct role in the economy. as at february 2013, less than half of the 33 glcs had been divested and 24 of them were supposed to have been divested between 2011 and 2012, according to the asian development bank (adb). an april 2013 paper by adb sought to answer the oft-asked question: are government-linked corporations crowding out private investment in malaysia? adb concluded that private investment in malaysia is indeed negatively affected by the dominance of glcs. we find that when glcs are dominant in an industry, investment by private firms is significantly negatively impacted. conversely, when glcs do not dominate an industry, the impact on private investment is not seen, according to the adb paper by jayant menon and thiam hee ng. private investment in malaysia  domestic or foreign  has never fully recovered from the impact of the asian financial crisis, adb notes. one explanation put forward in accounting for the sluggish performance of domestic private investment relates to the crowding-out effect as a result of the growing dominance of glcs in many sectors. the continued pervasiveness of glcs and their ability to exercise not only significant market power but also to use their special access to government and regulatory agencies to their favour suggests that they may present a formidable barrier to both competition and the entry of new private firms, adb adds."}, "7":

2016 (2qfy16) climb 10.7% to rm488 million or 6.5 sen per share. reviewing its performance for the quarter, maxis said the earnings came on the back of momentum, in terms of 4g long term evolution (lte) adoption. maxis said 4g lte users stood at 3.5 million and were consuming an average of 3.7gb/month. it said this represented an increase from 1.9 million and 2.2gb/month respectively, from a year ago. it had posted a net profit of rm441 million or 5.9 sen a share a year ago. quarterly revenue fell 0.4% to rm2.102 billion, from rm2.11 billion in 2qfy15, as both prepaid and postpaid service revenue declined by 5.3% and 1.7% to rm959 million and rm975 million respectively, on heightened price competition which resulted in a lower subscription base. the country's largest mobile telecom company by service revenue, announced an interim dividend of five sen per share, payable on sept 29. this brings its year-to-date (y-t-d) dividend to 10 sen per share. for the six months period ended june 30, 2016 (1hfy16), its net profit gained 18.2% to rm1 billion or 13.4 sen per share, as compared to rm851 million a year ago; while revenue fell 0.4% to rm4.24 billion, from rm4.26 million in 1hfy15. y-t-d, maxis' total subscribers fell by 10% to 11.015 million, comprising of 2.66 million postpaid subscribers and 8.108 million prepaid subscribers. its total subscribers stood at 12.214 million in 1hfy15, with 2.796 million and 9.068 million of postpaid and prepaid subscribers respectively. for the cumulative period, maxis' prepaid subscription momentum was impacted by price competition and as a result, prepaid service revenue declined 4.3% to rm1.972 billion, from rm2.061 billion a year earlier. \"prepaid average revenue per user (arpu), however, increased to rm39 from rm37 in 1hfy15, from continued traction on mobile internet usage, compensating for voice and sms decline,\" it added. postpaid service revenue grew 1.3% to rm1.967 billion, from rm1.942 billion, supported by a solid base of 1.292 million maxis one plan subscriptions. in total, maxis added 480,000 new one plan subscriptions during the quarter. postpaid monthly arpu also remained relatively stable at rm145. \"this wasn't our easiest quarter, where competition tried to improve subscriber market share by lowering prices,\" maxis chief executive officer morten lundal said in a statement. \"after some initial market turbulence, we saw at the closing of the quarter [that] our result improved and we managed to keep our revenue and profit at similar levels, compared to last year,\" he added. he noted that the average mobile internet usage in the last three months has grown to 2.5gb, from 1.7gb. \"for our internet hungry prepaid customers, we offered a very attractive proposition in hotlink fast that gives customers free 2gb of 4g internet every weekend for life,\" lundal said. aside from that, he said maxis had invested over rm1.3 billion last year and will invest the same amount to improve its operational efficiency to strengthen long-term competitiveness. maxis said it was the leading lte or 4g network, which has reached 80% of the population, covering more than 220 cities and towns. during the quarter, maxis caught itself in the middle of a fierce row with consumers over its offering of significantly cheaper mobile price plans to certain users but not others. this sparked users to switch to rivals axiata bhd (operator of celcom) or digi.com bhd, which offer more competitive price plans. in response to that, maxis in a news release then, had described the allegation as \"exaggerated\", saying the price plan being mentioned \"does not exist in the way it was described\". following the social media outcry, maxis had upgraded over a million customers to plans with a lot more data, which it described as the \"largest auto-upgrade it has ever done\" and largest ever in the country. shares of maxis dropped 10 sen or 1.61% to settle at rm6.11 as at midday break today, after 779,400 shares exchanged hands. the stock has lost 58 sen or 8.7% so far this year, underperforming the klci's 1.66% year-to-date decline."}, "8": {"date_posted":

are currently held by green packet bhds 19% and south koreas sk telecom co ltds 8.2%. the cmtn, which would be issued over three tranches, involve a rm1.65 billion programme over 16 years. there are still rm1 billion of cmtn which will be issued by p1 to fund its capital expenditure (capex). assuming sk telecom and green packet do not take up their remaining p1 cmtn allocation of 25% and 15% respectively, we estimate that tms equity stake in p1 could eventually rise to 89%. recall that tm earlier acquired a 57% equity stake in p1 for rm350 million cash in march 2014 as part of its plans to spearhead the groups convergence strategy of offering unified solutions through the bundling of fixed, wireless and mobile broadband services. hence, p1 was appointed the mobility centre for excellence, which includes tmgo broadband services. p1, currently offering data broadband, will target the urban population while tmgos focus has been on the rural segment. this forms telekoms convergence strategy in the delivery of end-to-end broadband and data services.  we maintain financial year 2015 (fy15) to fy17 forecast earnings for now notwithstanding the increased equity stake in p1, which registered a loss of rm186 million in nine months ended sept 30, 2015 (9mfy15). the remaining capex requirements for p1 are already incorporated into our net gearing forecasts. we expect p1s new launch of bundled products with tms offerings by first half of 2016 to mitigate its losses, given that the group has signed a domestic roaming arrangement for 2g and 3g services with axiata group bhds celcom. last month, celcom, tm and p1 signed a series of agreements involving tm next-gen backhaul high-speed broadband access and domestic roaming services to leverage on each others existing

will depend on pending further details on this latest move by the malaysian communications and multimedia commission (mcmc), including the spectrums which are to be redistributed or auctioned, pricing methodology and bidding process. \"key players that fail to retain their existing spectrum holdings could see the degradation of their network coverage,\" it added, noting that malaysias telco sector

greater opportunities for smaller telcos to gain stronger footholds in the industry via an increase in spectrum holdings, further intensifying competition between players. the rating agency noted that maxis debt load has increased over the years, given its hefty capital expenditure requirements and dividend payouts. as at end-september 2015, maxis adjusted gearing ratio stood at 2.42 times, while

volatile 2016", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on january 14, 2016.   kuala lumpur: khazanah nasional bhd, the countrys sovereign wealth fund, is bracing for another volatile year following disappointing data in 2015, which saw its net worth adjusted (nwa) of its investment portfolio  a measure of value created  fall 1.6% to rm109 billion from rm110.7 billion the previous year. describing 2015 as a roller coaster year, khazanah managing director tan sri azman mokhtar said the falling value of the ringgit, which was among the worlds worst-performing currencies last year, was partly to be blamed for the lower nwa. the funds realisable asset value (rav), however, rose 3.2% to rm150.2 billion last year from rm145.5 billion in 2014. malaysia accounted for 55.1% of khazanahs rav by geographic exposure; while sector-wise, media and communications stood at 22%, followed by healthcare (17.2%), power (15.3%), financial institution groups (13.7%) and property (10.6%). our [2015 nwa] performance might be slightly worse than the fbm klci [which dropped by 1% last year], but we fared better than most of the reference regional markets, azman told reporters at the 12th khazanah annual review yesterday. in its presentation, khazanah compared its investment portfolio against the fbm klci, the straits times index (-11.4%), the jakarta composite index (-10.5%), the hang seng index (-4%), sensex (-3.7%), the philippines index (-2%), the istanbul index (-14.1%), the msci emerging markets (-14.9%), the msci asia ex-japan (-9.2%) and the msci ac world (-0.3%). the sole index seeing growth in khazanahs reference regional index was the shanghai index, which rose by 11.2% in 2015. the weak ringgit did have some effect on our foreign liabilities. yes, we have us dollar-denominated assets like our shares in alibaba group holding ltd, which would have strengthened the asset value. on a net-net basis, the weak ringgit did have some effect on our investments, although not by much, azman said. towards this end, he said khazanah has capped its foreign liabilities to 30% of its investment portfolio, when at one point, it was more than 50%. looking at its major investments, only the healthcare sector, particularly ihh healthcare bhd, made a positive contribution to its nwa with a rm6.5 billion increase in 2015. other sectors saw declines. khazanahs investments in cimb group holdings bhd saw the biggest decline of rm2.3 billion, and its stake in the telecommunications sector, specifically telekom malaysia bhd and axiata group bhd, declined rm900 million in net worth. its foreign holdings in alibaba, meanwhile, also declined by rm100 million. khazanahs rav cover  the ratio of its rav to liabilities  came to 3.1 times in 2015, down from the previous years 3.7 times. khazanahs profit before tax also fell by 63.4% for the financial year ended dec 31, 2015 (fy15) to rm1.18 billion, from rm3.22 billion in fy14. this is the first time since the global financial crisis that khazanahs annual profit fell, excluding fy12 because of plus expressways bhds privatisation that occurred in fy11. despite weaker profitability, khazanah increased its dividend payout to the government by 16.7% to rm1.05 billion in fy15, from rm900 million the previous year. we might not be a listed company, but we want to have a dividend payout that is in line with major listed companies, where ideally you increase the payout gradually. and when there are years that you get a windfall, you declare special dividends, said azman. its not good to have a yo-yo pattern of dividends. the payout should have a steady progression. azman said while khazanah expects this year will be another bumpy one, the higher dividend payout and lack of profit growth last year would not affect its funds, should it decide to make new investments this year. by other metrics, like our asset cover ratio, cash flow, liquidity, we have enough to take advantage of the market this year when there are opportunities, he said. but this doesnt mean that khazanah wouldnt be careful with its investments this year, azman said. in times of turbulence, we need to look at the quality of our balance sheet and our rav cover, a critical ratio that we have always looked at, [which] indicates that we are coming from a position of relative strength.  the issue is more on the fact that in volatile and uncertain times, there is the risk of being too early or too late [in making investments], and trying to time the entry is not easy, he added. looking at the first week of trading in 2016, where the world markets fell when chinese stock markets were shut down twice after plummeting by 7%, he expects to see volatility continuing this year. we dont get funds coming in every month. its not like a pension fund where there are new deposits coming in. we have to be careful with our investments, azman said. in 2015, khazanah made 23 investments totalling rm8.7 billion and 10 divestments worth rm5.3 billion, with gains of rm2.9 billion. to date, the fund has made a total of 144 investments worth rm74.7 billion, as well as 77 divestments with overall gains of rm22.3 billion. meanwhile, azman said khazanah had injected rm1 billion into valuecap sdn bhd, following prime minister datuk seri najib razaks directive last year to the equity investment

with mha59 for the proposed disposal last thursday (dec 17). the deal involves the disposal of utusan land's entire 20% equity interest or 100,000 shares in maqamad to mha59. utusan said the original cost of investment in maqamad was rm100,000 incurred in april 2015. maqamad is principally involved in property development and general trading, and is actively seeking to increase its land bank for future business expansion, said utusan. mha59 is a subang-based private company, principally involved in the leasing of intellectual property and similar products (except copyrighted works), business management consultancy services and the development of building projects for its own operation. the sale proceeds will be utilised for utusan group's day-to-day operation.utusan said the disposal is expected to result in an improvement to its earnings by approximately rm48 million for the financial year ending dec 31, 2015, and contribute positively to its earnings per share. the publishing company, which is 49.77%-owned by umno and publishes the utusan malaysia and kosmo! newspapers, has been loss making since 2012. fidelity management and research (fmr llc), the second-largest mutual fund and financial services group in the world, has emerged as a substantial shareholder in ajinomoto (malaysia) bhd with a 5.04% stake. in a filing with bursa today, ajinomoto said fmr llc emerged as the company's shareholder after acquiring 3.04 million or 5% stake on dec 7. the monosodium glutamate (msg) manufacturer said the financial services group then acquired an additional 15,400 shares or 0.04% stake in the company via three separate transactions between dec 10 and dec 11. none of the filings stated the price of the transactions. following the purchases, fmr llc is now in control of 3.06 million or 5.04% stake in the company. ajinomoto was slapped with an unusual market activity query by bursa malaysia last thursday (dec 17) on the sudden rally in its share price. the counter saw its share price rise to an all-time high of rm9.30 last wednesday (dec 16) from rm7.31 on dec 10. pestech international bhd is tendering for contracts worth us$20 million in the philippines, said the group's executive director ir paul lim pay chuan. its customer in philippines, the national grid corporation (ngc), has a set of guidelines for international bidders and one of the requirements is for the bidder to have a branch office there.\nngc is a philippines government corporation created in 2001 by the electric power industry reform act. the company currently operates the country's power grid. information and communications technology (ict) security solutions provider scan associates bhd, which is embroiled in a boardroom tussle with former chief executive director and co-founder datuk dr norbik bashah idris, hopes to break even this financial year ending june 30, 2016 (fy16) backed by cost cutting efforts. its executive director mak siew wei, who is a substantial shareholder in the company with a 6.19% stake, said scan associates is looking to reduce its operating costs. a july 24 filing with bursa malaysia showed that norbik, together with former director hussin othman, has requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting to be convened to vote on the removal of four company directors including mak. norbik holds a 5.89% stake in scan associates as at sept 22, 2015. scan associates is currently being managed by its executive committee after the resignation of norbik in june this year. malaysian resources corp bhd (mrcb)'s executive director mohd imran mohamad salim said that it is a continuous effort for the group to simultaneously grow its business yet pare down debts that stood at 1.13 times its equity. after mrcb's extraordinary general meeting (egm) today, mohd imran told reporters that the group has been in talks with indonesian and thai companies to enter the property and construction businesses there. he said mrcb was looking at executing a deal with parties in indonesia and thailand sometime in 2017. meanwhile, mrcb, which is saddled with debts of rm3.06 billion, is open to selling the eastern dispersal link (edl) highway in johor, said chief financial officer ann wan tee.\nmohd imran added that, however, the focus now is on restructuring edl's debts. the highway, which was completed in 2012, had rm1.21 billion of outstanding debts. in total, mrcb's net borrowings stood at 1.13 times of its rm2.27 billion in shareholders' fund as at the end of the third quarter of its financial year ending dec 31, 2015 (3qfy15). mct bhd has dismissed the concerns of a possible mandatory takeover by its single largest shareholder ayala land inc after the latter raised its stake in the company to 32.95% on oct 16 from 9.16% previously for us$92 million. ayala land's shareholding is just 0.05% below the 33% threshold of a mandatory general offer (mgo). today, mct executive director datuk lim kok boon discounted the possibility and does not think ayala land will trigger a mgo.

[it is] consistent with axiatas merger and acquisition (m&a) priorities of an opportunistic footprint expansion, being both very attractive strategically and financially for the group, the statement read. axiata president and group chief executive officer (ceo) datuk seri jamaludin ibrahim said the acquisition was a rare opportunistic asset for the axiata group. consolidating ncell to axiatas fy14 pro forma, the new asset would be immediately accretive to the group, contributing approximately 9% to revenue and 19% to patami, and would make it one of the highest contributors to earnings for the group. this also increases the resilience of axiata with a more diversified portfolio given that ncell would be a very sizeable part of the group and lessen our traditional high dependency on the two largest operating companies. jamaludin also said the companys entry into nepal is a long-term strategic move for the group. ncells return on invested capital (roic) was over 70% in fy15, axiata said, and is the largest foreign direct investment in nepal. ncell also holds a sufficient and good mix of spectrum portfolio. this includes paired spectrum of 8 megahertz (mhz) of 900mhz, 11mhz of 1800mhz and 10mhz of 2100mhz spectrum, the statement added. the malaysian telco player also said nepals mobile industry landscape is a two-player market with a mobile penetration of unique subscribers of 51.1% and mobile broadband penetration of 21.5%, with 33.1% compound annual growth rate (cagr) in internet subscribers from 2012 to 2014. nepal also recorded an economic cagr of 4.2% over the past six year, with a young population where an estimated 68% of its total 28 million is below the age of 35, it noted. post-acquisition, axiata will have presence and reach in five key countries across south asia, besides its footprint in southeast asia, with over 280 million customers from 268 million currently. axiata's stock was suspended from trading pending the material announcement today. it was last traded at rm5.98, for a market capitalisation of rm52.72 billion.

khazanah nasional bhd managing director (md) tan sri azman mokhtar has had his contract extended for three more years, from june 1, 2016 to may 31, 2019. in a statement yesterday, khazanah, chaired by prime minister datuk seri najib razak, said its board of directors had approved to extend the employment contract of azman at a meeting on saturday. azman, 54, has been with the investment holding arm of the malaysian government since june 1, 2004. during his leadership tenure, the company reported a 10-year cumulative pre-tax profit of rm22.33 billion at the end of 2014. the net asset value of khazanahs investment also increased 9.2% to rm110.8 billion at the end of 2014 from rm101.5 billion a year earlier, bolstered by a rm3.9 billion gain from alibaba group holding ltds share sale. under azmans tenure, khazanah divested its 32.2% stake in national postal company, pos malaysia bhd, to drb-hicom bhd, owned by tycoon tan sri syed mokhtar al-bukhary, for rm622.79 million or rm3.60 per share in 2011. khazanah also sold its 42.7% stake in national carmaker proton holdings bhd to conglomerate drb-hicom for rm1.29 billion or rm5.50 per proton share the following year, as part of the governments strategy to boost liquidity in the local stock market and monetise assets. it was also during azmans tenure that khazanah in august 2011 sought to undertake a controversial share-swap deal between malaysian airline system bhd (mas), in which khazanah was its largest shareholder with a 69.37% stake, and low-cost carrier airasia bhd. however, this was later scrapped amid political pressure and protests from the workers union at mas. last year, khazanah bought the rest of mas in a bid to save the ailing national carrier. in december 2014, it delisted mas and revealed another turnaround plan involving rm6 billion in funding, 6,000 job cuts and less routes. it also transferred all operations, including assets and liabilities, to a new company called malaysia airlines bhd (mab), with an aim that the airline regains profitability by the end of 2017 and relists by 2020. azman is also the chairman of iskandar investment bhd and axiata group bhd and holds various board memberships including yayasan khazanah and jadwa investment of saudi arabia. he serves on various public service bodies including the performance management and delivery unit, executive committee of malaysia international islamic financial centre and governance council of agensi inovasi malaysia. formerly, he was the md and co-founder of binafikir sdn bhd, and director and head of country

"17": {"date_posted": "27/10/2015", "title": "myanmar deal to expand axiatas tower business", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on october 12 - 18, 2015.  just over two years after it failed in its bid to secure one of the two mobile operating licences up for grabs in myanmar, axiata group bhd has found another route to the regions last underpenetrated telecommunications market that could help lift its earnings in the coming years. whats more, axiatas entry into myanmar  by taking a 75% controlling stake in digicel myanmar tower co ltd (mtc) in a deal that values the latter at us$221 million (rm911.6 million)  also expands the companys portfolio of tower assets, which investors have long seen as a potential for initial public offering. an ipo would free up cash for expansion and dividend payments, but this is not a priority at the moment for axiata, which is looking to become one of the largest, most efficient and profitable tower companies in the world. it is currently in the top 20. in fact, axiata told analysts last week that edotco group sdn bhd  its wholly-owned subsidiary that is buying the 75% stake in mtc  is looking to buy at least one more tower company. its tower unit is working at expanding its portfolio from over 14,700 towers in august to as many as 25,000 by year end. when describing the mtc deal, axiata president and group ceo datuk seri jamaludin ibrahim said in a statement that the deal is very much in line with axiatas long-term strategy to create new revenue streams apart from the core mobile business. the acquisition will enhance axiatas telecoms tower infrastructure business significantly in a market outside the groups existing footprint. the mtc deal may also gain the group a new strategic partner in myanmar tycoon serge pun, whose singapore-listed yoma strategic holdings ltd (fundamental: 1.90; valuation: 1.10) owns the remaining 25% stake in mtc. forbes lists pun at no 45 on its singapores 50 richest list  he has an estimated net worth of us$505 million this year. his son and former goldman sachs banker melvyn pun, who is also yomas ceo, said in an oct 2 statement to the singapore exchange that the company is still in discussions with edotco regarding its 25% shareholding, will evaluate its options and make further announcements when there is a material development. it remains to be seen if yoma will stay on as a strategic partner or divest its 25% stake to axiata. yoma believes its stake is worth us$20 million more than the value carried in its books  based on the enterprise value of us$221 million agreed between digicel group ltd and axiatas edotco for the 75% stake. according to the presentation slides at yomas annual general meeting on july 27, part of the us$50 million loan it had received from the asian development bank (the first tranche of a us$100 million loan) has been earmarked for three projects, including the construction and leasing of telecoms towers by myanmar tower company. it is not immediately known whether any of the funds have been used. while analysts do not expect funding to be an issue for axiata (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.10), a strong local partner would be a boost for the company due to the perceived political risks. yoma, which is largely in the real estate, consumer and automotive businesses in myanmar, has experience in navigating the countrys complex land use laws and approval processes. this is imperative as securing sites and approvals to build towers is a lot tougher than securing funds, industry experts say. a written consent from yomas wholly-owned subsidiary, ysh finance ltd, is one of the conditions necessary for the transfer of digicel groups 75% stake to edotco. the deal also needs regulatory approvals in myanmar, where mobile penetration is less than 50% in a country with over 51 million people. in malaysia and indonesia, where axiatas two largest operating companies are based, the mobile penetration rate is 145% and 126% respectively. it is worth noting that axiata was among 13 shortlisted companies for a myanmar telecoms licence in 2013  it lost to norways telenor asa and qatars ooredoo. telenor myanmar ltd, which on sept 27 marked its first year of operation, said it had since july this year serve over 10 million customers with more than 3,100 towers across 13 major division/states. according to the myanmar times, ooredoo has 2,500 towers covering 72% of the population and is looking to raise that to 90% by year end. to be sure, the myanmar deal  as with any foreign investment deals  has its risks. citing unnamed market sources, the myanmar times on may 18 said mtc had been put on the block with all its contracts and sites. according to the same article, mtc had a 2013 agreement with ooredoo to build and lease 1,250 telecoms towers but unlike other tower companies, such as irrawaddy green towers, mtc did not provide power to ooredoo. this could not be independently verified at press time. having gained over 10% since the oct 2 announcement to close at rm6.38 last friday, axiata was among the top gainers last week  its gains more than double the bellwether fbm klcis over the same period. analysts are largely neutral on axiata, with 21 holds versus 10 buys. price targets range from rm6 to rm7.80, averaging at rm6.52, which implies limited upside in the near term. for now, analysts are not expecting any special dividends from axiata, given guidance of capital expenditure staying high next year. in its oct 2 statement, axiata describes edotco as the first regional tower service provider in asia, managing over 14,000 towers in the companies it operates in, including malaysia, sri lanka, bangladesh, cambodia and pakistan. axiata also operates in indonesia and has associate stakes in indias idea cellular ltd and singapores m1 ltd, but these were not named in the statement. in october last year, axiatas 66.5%-owned indonesian subsidiary, pt xl axiata tbk, was left with about 6,500 towers after it sold 3,500 communication towers to telecoms infrastructure firm pt solusi tunas pratama tbk for idr5.6 trillion (us$460 million). xl is leasing them back for 10 years to pare its debt. it is understood that indonesias regulation on foreign ownership of telecoms towers had complicated previous attempts to float axiatas global tower business. xl had previously said it could sell more towers. as it is, axiata says the mtc deal will not materially impact its earnings for the current year ending dec 31, but did not provide forward guidance in its oct 2 statement. with some luck and plenty of hard work, axiatas newly acquired platform in myanmar could turn into another cash cow for the group. in the meantime, however, analysts do not expect edotco to materially boost axiatas numbers for at least a year. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet

[emailprotected] kong yew has resigned from the loss-making marble and granite products manufacturer after completing his one-year assignment for the financial year of 2014/2015. in a filing with bursa malaysia today, stone master also cited to focus on his other business pursuits and commitments as the reason for wongs resignation. wong, 41, stepped down from stone masters board as an executive director on sept 30, which was earlier announced to bursa on sept 25. his resignation came after the company signed a slew of heads of agreement with china-based companies for the exclusive rights to distribute products under their brands in malaysia and singapore. the products range from wooden solid doors to environmentally friendly custom-made furniture and architectural aluminium doors. lay hong bhd, which has seen its shares surge about 65% to its closing price of rm5.40 today since aug 17, said it is in talks in relation to a possible joint venture (jv) project to invest in an integrated livestock business overseas. the jv has not been finalised at this juncture and both jv parties are finalising the principal terms before entering into any legal documentation, which has been targeted to be finalised in a month, lay hong revealed in its filing to bursa today. it was replying to an unusual market activity enquiry issued by the regulator earlier today. moreover, lay hong said it is in the midst of a discussion relating to a few possible new foreign investors, which is also yet to be finalised. the company had submitted a few proposals to the potential foreign investors and is currently waiting for their confirmation. the company expects to complete the negotiation within a month, it said. it also intends to acquire the thai unit of takaso resources bhd, takaso sc (thailand) ltd, as part of its business expansion in chicken and food processing to export to regional countries, at an indicative price of rm9 million, cash. it issued a letter of intent to takaso on sept 22, which has been accepted by takaso today, with an announcement on the proposed transaction being made in an earlier filing on the same day. lay hong said that it will make the necessary announcements for all transactions in due course, in compliance with its obligations under the main market listing requirements of bursa. the indicative consideration of rm9 million is approximately the total investment cost of takaso since the acquisition of tsc on nov 27, 2013, subject to the completion of the due diligence on tsc by lay hong. separately, takaso said tsc is currently dormant and was intended for the distribution and marketing of rubber related products and manufacturing and marketing of food business. the company, however, owns two factory buildings and a piece of land in sadao district, songkhla, thailand. takaso said the property was purchased for 25 million baht (rm3.02 million). in another statement, bursa malaysia said takasos securities will be traded and quoted under the o&c resources bhd name effective oct 7, 2015, while its warrants will also be re-named to o&c resources bhd-warrants 2011/2016. mercedes-benz malaysia sdn bhd, the joint venture between daimler ag and cycle & carriage bintang bhd, recorded year-to-date sales of more than 8,000 passenger cars, surpassing last years 6,932 units. year-on-year, mercedes-benz malaysia

our products in the market, raine told theedgemarkets.com during the launch of the new mercedes-amg c 63 s model today. despite the current challenging economic climate, mercedes-benz malaysia had achieved record-breaking monthly sales so far, according to raine. he said the record-breaking monthly sales were due to the successful sales of all types of mercedes-benz models. lonpac insurance bhd has filed a suit against perwaja steel sdn bhd (pssb), a subsidiary of practice note 17 company perwaja holdings bhd, kinsteel bhd and its 51%-owned subsidiary perfect channel sdn bhd over rm2.72 million in outstanding insurance premium. in a bursa filing, perwaja holdings said the three companies were served with a writ of summons and statement of claims on sept 18, 2015, filed by lonpac insurance. lonpac insurance is claiming for its outstanding insurance premium for insurance coverage for the period between jan 15, 2014 to may 25, 2014. the claims include rm2.72 million in outstanding insurance premium, interest calculated on this sum at the rate of 8% per annum from sept 30, 2014 to the date of full payment, cost of the action and other relief that the court deems fit. the case has been fixed for case management at the kuala lumpur high court on oct 12, 2015. pssb is a wholly-owned subsidiary of loss-making perwaja holdings, which, in turn, is a 31.25%-owned associate of kinsteel bhd. hub shipping sdn bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of hubline bhd, has been served with a winding-up petition by textainer equipment management ltd over claims amounting to us$3.73 million (rm16.47 million). in a bursa filing, the winding-up petitions against hub shipping were presented at the shah alam high court on sept 25 by textainer and a copy was served to the company today. hubline alleged that textainer is claiming an inflated amount, which includes items that hub shipping disputes. the marine shipping company said hub shipping has a container leasing contract with textainer; and while hub shipping was under a restraining order related to section 176(10a) of the companies act 1965, textainer had on july 15, 2015 made a demand under the companies act 1965 for the payment of us$3.73 million. the restraining order was sought by hub shipping to prevent potential litigations or proceedings from creditors that may adversely affect the restructuring currently undertaken by the group, which is exiting the container shipping industry. as it is exiting the container shipping industry, it has already fully provided for the impairment of the total cost of investment in the subsidiary at rm102 million. thus, the company is not expected to incur any further losses from the winding-up petition, hubline said. the company is seeking legal advice to resolve and/or enter into defence. case management of the matter has been fixed on jan 8, 2016. axiata group bhd plans to acquire a 75% stake in digicel asian holdings pte ltd (dah), a unit of digicel

capital requirements, of which, based on the expected closing date of nov 30, 2015, is expected to be approximately us$125 million (rm551.3 million), it said. the transaction values mtc at an enterprise value of us$221 million (approximately rm974.7 million), in line with market benchmarks for similar assets, said axiata. the deal, subject to the relevant regulatory approvals, will be financed by edotcos and/or axiatas internally generated funds and/or external borrowings. the transaction will deliver to edotco strategic majority control providing a platform in a highly attractive tower industry within its geographic area of focus, and further solidify edotco as a leading infrastructure provider to the greater southeast asian telecommunications industry. the acquisition will also expand edotcos footprint beyond axiatas existing operations, the statement read. lion corp bhd, which has fallen into practice note 17 status in oct 2013, is in the midst of securing potential investors for its subsidiary as part of its regularisation plan. in a bursa filing today, lion corp said its 78.89%-owned subsidiary megasteel sdn bhd would be included in the regularisation plan. megasteel is principally involved in the manufacturing and sale of hot rolled coils (hrc) and cold rolled coils. the company had been in the news of late when it cross defaulted on rm3.02 billion worth of loans. the company will continue to engage with potential investor(s) with a view to considering investment in megasteel and in this respect, discussions have been initiated with a party from northeast asia and it is still ongoing, said lion corp. the group added that the application to bursa securities for an extension of time of up to march 31, 2016 for lion corp to submit its

impact on the earnings of telecommunications companies (telcos), analysts said. analysts are of the view that telco players would be able to manage the cut in broadband package fees. furthermore, they said the move is positive in boosting the broadband take-up rate. communications and multimedia minister datuk seri ahmad shabery cheek said on wednesday that the basic broadband package prices are expected to drop by between 11% and 57% in a month or two. yesterday, telekom malaysia bhd (tm) said it will introduce two new broadband packages at lower prices. for light users, tm is offering 1mbps with data usage of up to 1gb for rm38 a month  excluding the goods and services tax (gst)  starting june 16. this is 57% lower than its current offering of rm88 for the same package. the basic broadband packages offered by the operators are already at affordable prices. the further reduction  as announced by the government  would not have much impact on them, an analyst said. their earnings will only be eroded if the government extends it to cover other broadband packages, he added. according to him, basic broadband packages priced at an average of rm60 to rm70 per month in the past have seen their prices decline gradually to only rm30. despite the significant drop in the price per gb of data, revenues of operators are still on the rise, he noted. it is worth noting that for heavy users, tm (fundamental: 1; valuation: 1.1) said it will lower the price of its unifi 10mbps triple-play package by 10% to rm179 a month from rm199, starting july 15. another analyst told the edge financial daily that users data consumption has increased noticeably since the emergence of smartphones and tablets. he added that most consumers  except for those in rural areas or new to the technology  would opt for data packages more than 1gb, making the price reduction redundant. at the time of writing, it was unclear whether other telcos will follow tms footsteps by lowering prices of packages targeted at heavy data users. meanwhile, kenanga research telecommunications analyst cheow ming liang said the sector could face some pressure on margins as a result of lower broadband entry prices. however, the impact is likely to be short-lived  given consumers tendencies to upgrade to higher connection speed as well as to subscribe to more value-added and internet-related services once they have more internet experience. we believe with these value-for-money offerings, more consumers will be able to get into the digital mainstream and participate in the digital world, he said. hlib research said the quantum of the data tariff reduction is a negative surprise, especially for fixed broadband. with a lower price barrier, we expect stronger net adds and traffic volume to partly offset the cut in prices, hlib research analyst tan j young said in a note yesterday. moreover, the delayed gst boost coming in june will also cushion the impact, he added. according to him, digi.com bhd (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 2.1) seemed to have the least impact due to small differentials compared with its existing data pricings, followed by axiata group bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.1) and maxis bhd (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 1.1). despite the minimal impact on the telcos, the market reacted negatively to the news with many of the counters closing in the red yesterday.

competition heated up.  pockets of disappointment in the consumer-related sector came from weaker consumer sentiment [volume sales were down] and poorer advertising expenditure sentiment [in the] media [sector], said maybank ib.  among big cap stocks under maybank ibs coverage, whose earnings surprised on the upside were malaysia airports holdings bhd, kuala lumpur kepong bhd, hong leong financial group bhd, ytl power international bhd and tenaga nasional bhd. stocks that negatively surprised were malaysian airline system bhd (mas), airasia x bhd (aax), bumi armada bhd, guinness anchor bhd, felda global ventures holdings bhd, axiata group bhd, telekom malaysia bhd and dialog group bhd.  maybank ib has revised its calls on eight stocks following 1q earnings season, with one upgrade and seven downgrades, compared with seven upgrades and eight downgrades in the previous quarter.  ann joo resources bhd is now a buy due to its limited downside to profitability and the stock is already trading at below trough price-to-book [value] of 0.7 times. of our seven downgrades, three stocks are now a sell  mas, th plantations bhd and ncb holdings bhd, it said.  other stocks downgraded to hold from buy were tan chong motor holdings bhd, aax, star publications (m) bhd and tsh resources bhd. this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on june 6, 2014."}, "30":

this was attributed to higher revenue contribution from sri lanka, bangladesh and cambodia. axiata said at constant currency, the group revenue would have registered a higher growth of 4.1% for its

telecommunications sector and see little scope for substantial share price appreciation given the sectors still lofty valuations at 10 times 2014 enterprise value/earning before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ev/ebitda) vis-a-vis 4.5% ebitda growth, and the likely rise in bond yields. nevertheless, downside is likely limited, a consequence of the trapped domestic liquidity. we see pockets of trading opportunity given the potential crystallisation of stock-specific catalysts in 2014. the possibility of a price war heading into 2014 cannot be entirely dismissed, particularly after the management restructuring at maxis bhd. nevertheless, the new chief executive officers statement that maxis will not compete on pricing was a welcome relief. we thus expect competition among the cellular majors to remain rational in the next 12 months. this will allow the companies to continue to focus on further monetising data. the growth in data usage is both explosive and secular, driven by: (i) increased users; (ii) faster internet access; and (iii) improved content. for fixed-line players, we continue to expect growth in data revenue to more than offset falling voice revenue. with maxis re-evaluating its integrated model, the competitive intensity in the fibre broadband segment could potentially decline. within the next 12 months, digi.com bhd will announce its decision on whether to pursue a business trust (to overcome its dividend payout constraints). telekom malaysia bhd (tm) could potentially receive a government grant for the rollout of phase 2 of its high speed broadband service, while axiata group bhd is working on a potentially value creating tower spin-off. in the longer term, time dotcom bhd (tdc) could once again unload its remaining digi shares. maxis meanwhile could demonstrate signs of a turnaround. our only buy in the sector is tdc (target price [tp]: rm4.40), as it is most exposed to the secular growth trends of data, and has capital management potential. among the big caps, our relative preference is tm (hold, tp: rm5.50) and digi (hold, tp: rm4.95) given their underperformance in 2013 and the emergence of potential rerating catalysts in the near term.  maybank ib research, jan 3 this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on january06, 2014."}}
