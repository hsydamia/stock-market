{"0": {"date_posted": "23/4/2018", "title": "a shift to laggards on the cards", "article": " kuala lumpur: the fbm klci index closed at a record high of 1,896.18 points last thursday, after more than a three-year wait when it last tested this level. what is even more impressive is that during the last one year, about 22.5% or 207 of the companies listed on bursa malaysia have touched their all-time highs while about 50% of these companies recorded new highs this year. a look at companies on bursa reveals that there is another set of companies  making up 20% of listed counters  that has been overlooked after hitting record highs between 2013 and 2015. notably, oil price collapsed in mid-2014. recall that the malaysian stock market saw a sharp decline following the collapse of crude oil prices, with the fbm klci falling to its five-year low of 1,532.14 in august 2015. however, despite the strong recovery in the fbm klci, most of these companies that hit their all-time highs before the oil price collapse are still lagging far behind, by an average of 47.5%. some analysts believe that some of these counters could see a gradual recovery, especially the oil and gas (o&g) players, given the rally in oil prices recently. abel goon, an analyst with ta securities, told the edge financial daily that a sustained level in oil price will benefit some of the o&g counters on bursa, especially if it translates into higher capital expenditure (capex) among o&g majors. if you look at the malaysian stock market, a lot of the oil and gas counters are related to services and will not benefit directly from the increase in the oil prices. if oil prices can sustain at this level and encourage capex, it will lead to more activities for players like umw oil and gas corp bhd, sapura energy bhd and others, goon explained. he pointed out that counters like hibiscus petroleum bhd and dagang nexchange bhd could benefit directly from the rise in oil prices. rakuten trade sdn bhd vice-president of research vincent lau concurred, pointing out that sentiment in the o&g industry has definitely improved as seen by the share price rally in some of the counters such as sapura energy. other laggards such as malaysia building society bhd (mbsb), which is now a full-fledged islamic bank, could also benefit as there are not a lot of islamic bank counters available on the exchange, he noted. mbsb closed at rm1.15, which is about 50.9% off its all-time high of rm2.34 recorded in 2013. other sectors such as telecommunications could also see a return of interest among investors if they can sustain earnings amid a competitive environment. while telcos may still need time to prove themselves, lau said recent adjustments made to their products to stay ahead of competition were not done at the expense of the players existing pricing, which is a positive for the sector. maxis bhd, axiata group bhd, telekom malaysia bhd and digi.com bhd are on average about 18% below their all-time highs. for other past winners, it remains uncertain if they can regain their former glory. for example, british american tobacco (malaysia) bhd (bat malaysia) has fallen by 60.6% from its all-time high of rm63 recorded in 2014. for its financial year ended dec 31, 2014 (fy14), bat malaysia posted a revenue of rm18.6 billion and a net income of about rm902.9 million. its latest set of financials for fy17 paled in comparison as group revenue fell by more than half to rm7.1 billion while net profit fell by 44.6% to rm500 million.  the performers as for the 207 companies that touched their all-time highs in the last one year, most of them have benefited from the oil price collapse, a weak ringgit as well as the many mega infrastructure projects that were announced. infrastructure projects that were announced by prime minister datuk seri najib razak (now caretaker prime minister) have spurred most of the construction players that were awarded contracts related to most of the infrastructure projects. gamuda bhd, lingkaran trans kota holdings bhd, george kent (malaysia) bhd and ekovest bhd were some of the companies that saw strong growth during this time, which also coincided with the rally in their share prices. exporters of semiconductors, gloves, consumer products and furniture benefited from the weak ringgit at the time. strong demand for electrical and electronic goods has also benefited malaysias semiconductor industry. the banking sector also saw a recovery from some of the impairment losses that were recorded when oil prices collapsed and are back on investors radar as seen by the recent strong performance in their share prices and positive financial results. but with such a strong uptrend seen in the last three years, questions over the sustainability of this good run begin to surface. apple incs main chip supplier taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co last week lowered its second-quarter revenue guidance on softer smartphone demand and uncertainty over the cryptocurrency mining market, leading to a decline in the share prices of semiconductor players. it is worth noting that semiconductor-related players on bursa were one of the main ones that hit new highs in the last one year  most of them early this year or late last year. as of last friday, however, semiconductor players had fallen by an average 26.3% from their record highs, which is significant considering that the new highs were only achieved in the last one year. other than semiconductors, consumer plays such as nestle (malaysia) bhd, dutch lady milk industries bhd, ajinomoto (malaysia) bhd and breweries such as heineken malaysia bhd and carlsberg brewery malaysia bhd have all fallen from their record highs by about 9%-10%. it is worth noting that most of these recent highs were recorded in the first quarter this year. while most of these companies are resilient in terms of earnings, they were traded at expensive levels compared to their peers and historical valuation. exporters are also expected to see some pressure on their earnings with the stronger ringgit, which has strengthened by 12.8% from a year ago to 3.8977 against the us dollar. as for the fbm klci component stocks, while it remains the second best performing index in southeast asia so far this year, valuation has become more expensive with its trailing price-earnings ratio (per) at 17.8 times, which is slightly higher than its five-year average per of 17.2 times."}, "1": {"date_posted": "14/3/2018", "title": "fbm klci down as us trade, political cues hit world

ago. however, the index is still above the support level of 1,800 points and this indicates that the market is still in a bullish trend. technically, the fbm klci has fallen below the short-term 30-day moving average and this indicates that the trend has turned slightly bearish in the short term. however, in the intermediate and long term, the index is still above the 200-day moving average and the ichimoku cloud indicator. momentum indicators like the relative strength index and momentum oscillator continue to decline and are trading at their mid-levels. furthermore, the index also has fallen below the middle band and the moving average convergence divergence indicator continues to decline. therefore, the technical indicators indicate that the fbm klci is currently in a bullish trend correction. the support level for the bullish trend is at 1,800 points and as long as it can stay above this level, the trend may continue to be bullish. well, when will the trend turn bullish? the indication would be when the fbm klci can break above the resistance level of 1,870 points. if this happens, we will be looking at the index climbing to historical highs. the above commentary is

valuation become less expensive. last thursday, the telecommunications group reported an 80.4% year-on-year (y-o-y) jump in net profit to rm909.48 million, while revenue rose 13.2% y-o-y to a record rm24.4 billion in the financial year ended dec 31, 2017 (fy17). the stock currently trades at 55 times its earnings over the trailing 12 months. that compares to a price-earnings ratio (per) of 88

last fridays closing. its local rival maxis bhd was trading at 21 times to its earnings, while digi.com bhd has a per of 25.8 times. jf apex securities bhd analyst lee cherng wee said although axiata is more expensive than its regional peers, the prospects of axiata are promising through its subsidiaries celcom axiata bhd and pt xl axiata tbk. celcom and xl are the two largest contributors to axiatas revenue, accounting for 27% and 30.2% respectively in fy17. lee thinks the growth momentum in its subsidiaries celcom and xl will continue in fy18 as their ongoing cost efficiency improvement programme was reflected in the fy17 results. still, analysts arent getting too excited about axiatas performance in fy18. lee is of the view that fy18 would still be challenging for axiata due to regulatory risk in its operating companies (opcos) in various different markets and ongoing price war, especially in indonesia. while its president and group chief executive officer tan sri jamaludin ibrahim noted that the group improved by leaps and bounds in fy17 compared with fy16, he said axiata is still not there yet. at the groups fourth quarter of fy17 (4qfy17) media briefing last week, jamaludin pointed out that even though celcoms and xls turnaround plans are on track, their recoveries have not completed so far. the group has set key performance indicators (kpis) for fy18 of a 6.3% revenue growth, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation growth of 5.8%, up to 5.5% return on invested capital, 5% return on capital employed and capital expenditure of rm7.4 billion. hong leong investment bank (hlib) research analyst tan j young is of the view that the kpis for fy18 are not so exciting. results-wise, it was okay [for fy17]. however, axiatas indian associate idea cellular ltd was a drag on the groups earnings and will continue to be so in the near term. management guidance for fy18 was not so exciting. we prefer to wait and see for now [as] we need to see more recoveries from celcom and xl, tan told the edge financial daily over the phone. he has a hold call on axiata, with a target price of rm5.01. bloomberg data showed that out of the 27 analysts covering axiata, 16 have issued hold recommendations on the stock, two have sell calls and nine have buy ratings. their target prices range from rm4 to rm6.50. the counter closed two sen or 0.35% lower at rm5.65 last friday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm51.12 billion. an analyst who declined to be named said celcoms recent reduction in cost was also in line with lower subscriber base. when you have fewer subscribers, naturally cost would be lower as well, in terms of customer service and direct costs, he added. the malaysian market is somewhat mature now, axiatas future growth has to be driven by its venture in emerging markets. for example, [its 83.32%-owned] dialog axiata plc reported strong growth in fy17, opcos like this, except for investment in india, are yielding results, the analyst added. lee, who has a hold call on axiata with a target price of rm5.20, said the groups intention to seek growth by investing into fixed wireless broadband this year may be challenging. it will have to start small as it has cleared the air that there will not be a merger with telekom malaysia bhd (tm). likewise, tms unifi mobile will face difficulties growing [fast]. a merger would have been a short cut for both companies, but it is a complex matter, he said. lee was referring to jamaludins remarks on thursday that there was no re-merger talks ongoing between axiata and tm despite the potential synergies. rather, both companies will undertake usual business collaboration to leverage on their respective strengths, he said. hlib researchs tan said over the long run, it is still better for both parties to merge as malaysian market is too crowded. in the long run, we think it is still better to merge axiatas domestic opco, which is celcom, with tm, because they will eventually step into each others field. an entire merger between tm and axiata may not as synergistic, he said. malaysia market is still crowded to me, taking into account of tms unifi mobile, we have five major ones, plus the other mobile virtual network operators, it is too many for our population of 31 million people. in the us, they have four major operators, serving more than 300 million population, while there are only three major operators in china, with population of more than 1.3 billion people, tan added."}, "6": {"date_posted": "23/2/2018", "title": "klci to end

improvement in its earnings after witnessing four consecutive years of earnings contraction at its operating companies  celcom axiata bhd and indonesias pt xl axiata tbk. the turnaround appears to be expected by the market as seen by the gain of 1.1% in the first 10 trading days of 2018. this was in contrast to its share price performance in the last three years where it fell by about 14.6%. according to cimbs ng, axiatas core earnings per share is expected to rebound by a strong 29% and 50% for its forecast for financial years ending dec 31, 2018 and 2019 respectively due to much higher contributions from xl, net profit break-even for airtel bangladesh ltd by end-2018 and cessation in equity accounting for ideas losses post-merger with vodafone. rakutens yee concurred, noting that axiatas digital transformation is expected to bring an improvement to its earnings. other than that, the news flow of a potential initial public offering of its tower unit, edotco group sdn bhd, this year is also another catalyst for axiata, he said. 3) banking sector cimb, maybank affin hwang asset managements pola is of the view that banks are among those that could do well in 2018. this year has been about improvement in asset quality. in 2018, we should see stronger pre-provision growth, especially if interest rates rise, which will lead to net interest margin expansion [but to a lesser extent compared to its singapore counterparts], she said. she added that loan growth should be slightly stronger after the disappointing 2017. pola, however, noted that there is still an overhang on the sector as the impact of malaysian financial reporting standards 9 (mfrs9) has yet to be fully known but if the impact on provisions or book values is low as expected, it would clear another uncertainty that remains for the banking sector. our top picks are cimb group holdings bhd (inexpensive valuations) and malayan banking bhd (maybank) (possibility of capital management after mfrs9, better cash dividends, the possible listing of etiqa). hong leong bank bhd has impressive fundamentals but valuations are a bit stretched, she added. similar to pola, rakutens yee highlighted that both cimb and maybank could be proxy for foreign buying into the banking sector. maybank is also a defensive play with its relatively high dividend yield of over 5%, he added. ta securities also picked cimb as one of its top picks for 2018 in its annual strategy report. its analyst wong li hsia said cimb has been outpacing its peers in terms of yearly profit growth since the fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2015. she also pointed that better prospects in cimb niaga and cimb thai as one of the investment themes that will drive cimb. credit charges have eased. while we forecast the overall credit charge to remain elevated, we believe the worst  in terms of asset quality may be over, led by further recoveries in its overseas operations, wong said. cimbs share price gained 3.7% ytd to close at rm6.78 last friday, while maybanks share price edged higher by 0.5% to rm9.85. 4. petronas gas bhd the selldown at the end of last year created a value proportion for those who are interested in investing in petronas gas bhd (petgas). the share price fell by 4.8% compared with three years ago to its closing price of rm19.00 last friday. petgas share price fell to its low of rm15.88 in november last year compared with its three-year peak of rm22.02 in october 2015. yee believes that the selldown was overdone and was mainly due to third-party access framework concern. while the market has recovered by 19.6% from its low since then, petgas is still trading at about 4.9% below its three-year average price of rm19.93.\n"}, "11": {"date_posted": "15/1/2018", "title": "klci to

corporate debt outpaces earnings growth", "article": " the net debt of companies listed on bursa malaysia continues to outpace their earnings growth based on their latest filings with the stock exchange. companies (excluding banks) that compose local benchmark the fbm klci saw their aggregate net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) rise 149% to 1.37 times as at aug 28 from 0.55 times five years ago. in the same period, their earnings per share (eps) remained relatively flat  it stood at 105.73 sen per share as at last tuesday. if a corporation takes advantage of leverage to grow its business, earnings growth should outpace rising debt but this has not been the case in the last couple of years, areca capital sdn bhd ceo danny wong tells the edge. what we have seen in the last couple of years is that companies are borrowing due to cash flow problems as opposed to growing their business. a lot of them are facing problems in collecting payments from sales. there has been a rise in receivables, thus leading to poor cash flow for companies, eventually contributing to an increase in debt. the addition of borrowing costs has impacted the bottom lines of companies as well, he explains. this is reflected in ram credit information sdn bhds (ramci) report, which shows that the average debt repayment trend of industries crept up to 70 days in the second quarter of this year compared with 66 days in the first quarter. in other words, corporations in malaysia are taking a longer time to repay their debt. nonetheless, ramci ceo dawn lai thinks the trend could be merely cyclical. some sectors have seen an improvement in payment speed while others have seen a slowing down. it could be cyclical. we would need to watch the trend for a few more quarters, she says via email. apart from the companies on the fbm klci, the total net debt of those listed on bursa, excluding banks and newly listed entities, also rose  by 81.4% from 2012 to rm295.7 billion  based on their latest filings. in the same period, revenue grew 18.9% to rm981.9 billion while net income edged up 0.98% to rm97.5 billion. tenaga nasional bhd recorded the highest net debt of rm26.3 billion among all the listed companies in the country, based on its latest filings. this represents an increase of 66.3% from 2012. by comparison, its latest 12-month revenue and net profit grew 28.9% and 57.5% from 2012 to rm46.2 billion and rm6.95 billion respectively. it is even more worrying that some of the companies have seen a decline in net profit while net debt rose. of the top 20 companies with the highest net debt, more than half have seen their bottom lines shrink from five years ago, based on their latest results. those with the biggest fall in net income are bumi armada bhd, felda global ventures holdings bhd, axiata group bhd, ioi corp bhd, malaysia airports holdings bhd and sapura energy bhd. bumi armada, which is involved in the oil and gas industry, slipped into the red, suffering a loss of rm1.2 billion, based on its latest 12-month performance. this is despite its net debt ballooning by 387.1% from 2012 to rm10.6 billion now. sapura energy, another oil and gas player, also saw its net profit fall, by 55.4% from 2012 to rm125.5 million, despite an increase of 21 times in its net debt to rm14.8 billion, according to its latest filing with bursa. moodys investors service agrees that the earnings of malaysian firms have not grown as much as their borrowings, pointing to the rise in their debt-to-ebitda ratio to 4.1 times last year from 2.4 times in 2007. moodys senior credit officer and vice-president eugene tarzimanov, however, says this trend is similar to the rapid build-up in non-financial corporate debt the world over after the 2007/08 global financial crisis. interestingly, the share of corporate debt owed by weak firms, those with interest coverage ratios or icrs (ebitda-to-interest expense ratio) of below 1, increased only marginally to 7% in 2016 from 6% in 2007 as interest rates remain relatively low in malaysia, particularly after the overnight policy rate (opr) cut last year, he adds. bank negara malaysia cut the opr by 25 basis points to 3% in july last year due to rising risks from the brexit vote in europe. it was the central banks first cut in seven years. looking at all the listed companies in malaysia, tarzimanov considers the health of the malaysian corporate sector as broadly good but observes some weaknesses in commodity-related industries (oil and gas, transport, marine and mining) and import-dependent industries (such as automotive). in terms of corporate debt level relative to gross domestic product (gdp), malaysia is better off than many other asian economies, according to tarzimanov. malaysias ratio stands at around 70% based on bis (bank for international settlements) data, lower than that of australia, singapore, vietnam and china. malaysias corporate debt-to-gdp ratio, however, is a bit higher than that of thailand, india, indonesia and the philippines (all below 50%), he says. nonetheless, the gearing ratio (debt-to-equity ratio) in malaysia deteriorated to 70% last year from 60% in 2015, indicating that companies have more debt in their capital structure. tarzimanov says malaysia is about average compared with the rest of asia on this measure.  increase in debt level normal a fund manager who requested anonymity considers the increase in the debt level of malaysian listed companies as normal because most of them are taking advantage of the global low interest rate environment. he attributes the slower pace in earnings growth compared with net debt partly to the collapse in oil prices in the last two to three years. if you look at malaysia, we are a commodity-driven economy. there are quite a lot of oil and gas-related companies on the fbm klci as well as bursa. these companies have seen a decline in their earnings and a rise in borrowings in order to manage cash flow. its also a process, i believe. some of the borrowings were made to invest in long-term projects. look at ekovest. the company has a lot of projects in the pipeline but earnings will take a longer time to materialise. still, most of them would generate sustainable long-term earnings, he says. ekovests net debt jumped 103 times from 2012 to rm1.88 billion, its latest filings show. revenue and net profit in the last 12 months grew 407.9% and 214.4% from 2012 to rm1.06 billion and rm228.4 million respectively. the fund manager notes that on average, the icrs of companies listed on bursa remain at very comfortable levels. bloomberg data shows that the aggregate ebitda-to-interest expense ratio for malaysian listed companies stood at 5.8 times as at aug 29, slipping slightly from 6.1 times in 2012.

participants apparently had taken the chance to play on the selling side. with no immediate supportive buying interest in sight, the benchmark index fell below the 1,781 support to a low of 1,780.71, it said. the research house said this simply explained that supply forces were greater than the demand forces. it said the downside violation of the 1,781 level would be triggering a sell signal for

prevent ncell from launching 4g services until the settlement of an ongoing dispute over capital gains tax (cgt). \"this directive was issued without holding a meeting with members of the pac, as most of these lawmakers were in their home districts to prepare for the second phase of local elections scheduled for june 14. the pac had decided to issue the directive after the telecom sector regulator

pac and bar ncell from launching the 4g service. amid the confusion, goh said additional one-off regulatory costs and potentially operational disruptions may arise for ncell, and so he expects

addition, axiata has also granted mitsui a call option for us$92.4 million to acquire an additional 10% stake which is exercisable within 12 months of completion of the transaction, which is by the end of may 2017. should mitsui exercise the call option, axiata will continue to hold controlling and majority interests in smart at 72.5%. the disposal proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and repayment of existing debt. strategically, the corporate exercise will enable axiata to tap into mitsuis expertise in digital series and the internet of things offerings. this will enable smart to further strengthen its digital leadership in cambodia. as at dec 31, 2016, the groups net cash holdings amounted to rm16,927.5 million. assuming that the whole proceeds will be utilised to pare down existing debt, the net cash position will improve by +4.1% to rm16,241.7 million. despite the exercise being part of axiatas portfolio rebalancing strategy, we view that the positive impact on the disposal to the balance sheet is minimal. for financial year 2016 (fy16), smarts earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) contribution to axiata stood at 6.7% or rm538 million. assuming the exercise took place in fy16, smarts ebitda contribution would be reduced by 21.6% to rm422 million. this would mean that smarts ebitda contribution would form 5.3% of the groups total ebitda. as such, the dilution in ebitda is negligible as well. we are maintaining axiatas tp at rm4.98 per share. this is premised on pegging fy17 ebitda to 7.5 times enterprise value/ebitda, which is the groups five-year historical average. the performance of the groups main operating segments has been under pressure. our primary concern lies in future prospects for celcom axiata bhd, which is one of the groups main ebitda contributors. this is mainly attributable to the heightened price war among its peers. in addition, with the active merger and acquisition activities

video content and data promotions. xl significantly increased its subscriber base by 4.6 million, or 11% year-on-year (y-o-y) in the fourth quarter of financial year 2016 (4qfy16). this stemmed largely from prepaid subscribers that rose 1.4 million quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) to 45.9 million, while postpaid users increased 22,000 q-o-q to 533,000. however, monetisation of rapidly growing data

nevertheless, after adjusting for one-off accelerated depreciation, foreign exchange, tax and capital lease gains, xls 4qfy16 core net profit of 41 billion rupiah was a welcome relief following five consecutive quarters of normalised losses. recall that the stronger xl bottom line stemmed from a 1% increase in tower lease revenue, a 15% reduction in interest charges from its recent rights issue

", "article": "  2016 is a year we want to forget, says axiata group bhd president and group ceo tan sri jamaludin ibrahim in his usual energetic and straightforward manner. no coffee for him today, only a cup of hot milo for what must be a long day. it is now 5pm in axiatas boardroom that overlooks kl sentral. jamaludin has just wrapped up a two-hour-long conference call with analysts, and before that he was taking questions from the media. jamaludin has spent the whole day addressing the groups first quarterly net loss in six years - rm272.06 million for the fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2016, and a sharp drop in dividends from 20 sen to eight sen per share for fy2016 and fy2017. not surprisingly, axiata saw its share price plunge following the release of its fourth-quarter and full-year fy2016 results last thursday. at last fridays close of rm4.31 apiece, the stock has lost 10%, or rm4.3 billion, of its market capitalisation. but if jamaludin is feeling the pressure, he certainly does not show it. instead, he seems perkier than usual. for the most part, the poor results can be attributed to one-off costs that we wont apologise for  the merger of robi and airtel in bangladesh, acquisition of (an 80% stake) in ncell (pte ltd) in nepal, and the foreign exchange losses that are beyond our control. these [exercises] have to be done for the long term, so we are okay with that, says jamaludin. without the unfavourable forex rate movement that resulted in rm824 million in losses, he points out that axiatas fy2016 earnings would have been on a par with that in fy2015. but the area where we can acknowledge the problem is our op-co (operating companies) performance in malaysia and, to some extent, indonesia, he says. stripping out one-off costs and impairments, axiata saw its profit-after-tax and minority interests (patmi) fall rm653 million, or 31.5%, year on year, due to weaker operational performance. this can largely be pinned on celcom axiata bhd, which saw its patmi fall 25.2% y-o-y to rm966 million in fy2016. intense competition in the sector contributed to the poor results, but jamaludin makes it clear that he is not satisfied with celcoms performance, which, he says, is the worst among the incumbents. the good news is that fy2016s poor performance is the kick that celcom needed to step up its game. externally, this can be clearly seen by the changes in celcoms management  michael kuehner replaced datuk seri shazalli ramly as ceo last year. there are four main problems with celcom  product, network, distribution and organisation, explains jamaludin. he blames it problems for the delay in launching new products quickly, but points out that celcom will catch up by the end of the first quarter. while the spectrum refarming delayed network upgrades by about six months, jamaludin concedes that internal problems exacerbated the delays. however, he aims to improve celcoms network to become either the best or second best in most places by year-end. distribution is perhaps the toughest problem celcom faces, notes jamaludin. without providing details on how he will solve the shortcomings, he assures that they will be addressed by year-end. meanwhile, he expects celcom to adjust to the changes in senior management by the second half of the year. in short, celcom will be finding its footing this year.  a lacklustre 2017 jamaludin expects the group to stabilise this year after several years of aggressive expansion. however, he cautions that there are still some risks that the group has to look out for unfavourable forex movement and regulatory risks in the form of additional spectrum fees. that said, this year might still be good, given that 2016 has set a pretty low base. 2016 was a perfect storm. external factors such as forex [losses of about rm824 million] hit us hard. if i add that back to my profit, id be on par with 2015, says jamaludin. then we had regulatory issues. it is unheard-of to pay rm820 million for spectrum (fees in malaysia). then we had the cgt (capital gains tax) issue in nepal that hit us for us$24 million. and then, xl in indonesia  we were so sure they [the authorities] would approve network sharing, but in the end they did not. the interconnection in indonesia was also announced, but eventually it was retracted, he adds. political changes abroad also made operating in these foreign environments even more challenging. we were working on some programmes in cambodia. i was supposed to meet a minister. but just as i arrived in the morning, i was told the minister had been replaced. it happened while i was on the plane. so, what about the lunch meeting? it had to be a farewell lunch, i was told, says jamaludin. i was also supposed to meet the nepalese prime minister to sort out the cgt issue. i had an appointment set up and flew over. but when i arrived that night, i was told there has been a change in government. again, i was on the plane when it happened, he says. looking ahead, this year will also see several changes that will strengthen axiata. for starters, the dividend cut will give the company some breathing room to stabilise. the reduction is estimated to save rm2 billion overtwo years. this will not only reduce the groups dependence on borrowings, it will also give axiata more resources to undertake acquisitions if the opportunity arises. jamaludin also plans to halve axiatas unhedged us dollar debt exposure that now stands at about us$1.4 billion. axiata had inherited about us$1.4 billion of us dollar debts when it acquired ncell, of which us$1.1 billion was unhedged. it signed the deal when the ringgit was valued at 3.9 against the dollar. the subsequent depreciation of the ringgit to 4.48 against the greenback created the massive forex losses. the good news is that rm512 million of the forex losses are unrealised.this means if the ringgit strengthens, axiata may yet be able to book in some forex gains. it is interesting to note that axiata booked an accelerated depreciation of about rm600 million during the year  rm193 million for xl in indonesia and rm111 million for robi in bangladesh. celcom also took the opportunity to clean up its inactive subscribers, removing nearly 400,000 in 4qfy2016. axiata may come off a low base, but without a catalyst this year, its share price might remain lacklustre. however, additional selling pressure on the groups shares may make it attractive to accumulate. after all, axiata is expected to resume paying 20 sen a share u00addividends by 2018, if all goes well.

multimedia bhd has received a takeover offer from a local investment fund to acquire a controlling 51% stake in the loss-making information technology company, according to sources close to the deal. two sources told the edge financial daily that the fund, which is linked to a local life sciences company, is ready to make an offer for nine sen per share, which values palette at rm28.76 million. the nine sen offer price represents a 50% premium to palettes closing share price of six sen last friday. when contacted, palette chairman and managing director eg kah yee admitted to having received a written takeover offer that came through a local bank-backed investment bank, but declined to elaborate. over the years, we have some companies coming to us [with proposals]. but recently, yes, there is a fresh offer on the table to take a controlling stake in our company. we will study the deal, discuss [with board members], and figure out whats the next step, he told the edge financial daily via telephone. we are looking at it, but [theres] nothing concrete at the moment. we are not in a selling mode, but i believe anything is sellable and everything has a price tag, eg said. eg, 56, is the founder and single largest shareholder of palette with a 17% stake. he is also the chief executive officer of key asic bhd, a supplier of high performance, low power application-specific integrated circuit design and manufacturing services. founded in 1997, palette is a solutions provider of broadband, wireless and networking products and services. its clients include telekom malaysia bhd, celcom axiata bhd, maxis bhd and shell refining co (federation of malaya) bhd. based on palettes net assets of rm11.7 million or 3.66 sen per share as of aug 31, 2016, the stock is currently trading at a price-to-book value of 1.6 times. however, it is learnt that the potential buyer is willing to pay between two and 2.5 times palettes book value in order to gain a controlling stake in the company. at the nine sen per share offer price, the prospective investor will have to fork out about rm14 million for the 51% stake in palette. while the actual structure of the takeover is still up in the air, the proposed deal is likely to trigger a mandatory general offer (mgo) as its shareholding crosses the 33% threshold level. still, the prospective investor can seek a waiver for the mgo. meanwhile, it also remains to be seen as whether the fund is keen to run the company together with eg, or prefer a buyout that would eventually see him exiting palette. after reporting seven consecutive years of losses, palette returned to the black in the financial year ended may 31, 2016 (fy16) with a net profit of rm2.1 million on revenue of rm3.6 million. however, the group slipped back into the red in first quarter of fy17 with a net loss of rm516,000 on revenue of rm222,000. there was no comparable period as palette had changed its year end to may 31 from dec 31. going forward, palette is expecting its mobile healthcare platform to be a key revenue driver for fy17. the platform, dubbed i-medic, connects doctors and specialists with patients, through the use of multiple medical and fitness-tracking devices, via a mobile application that runs on smart devices. on the sidelines of palettes annual general meeting last month, eg reportedly said the company will be focusing on the china market first, banking on the large population and growing affluence of the people, and has inked a deal with shanghai international medical centre to set up an international mobile healthcare centre, known as the 3rd centre. patients will no longer need to visit the doctors face-to-face as frequently as before, and this is a big step forward for international medical tourism, he said. due to its disruptive nature, some people even called palettes i-medic the uber or alibaba of the medical sector. interestingly, palette also plans to diversify into traditional chinese medicine (tcm) to expand its earnings base. the company had on nov 24 said it had entered into a term sheet to acquire a 51% stake in genopharma sdn bhd (gsb) for rm1.53 million. gsb is principally involved in the trading of tcm, food and herbal supplements. currently, gsb products are sold at tcm clinics, pharmacies and chain stores. it also supplies herbal-based medicines and supplements to hospitals and clinics in malaysia. the proposed acquisition will enable palette to expand its earnings base and invest in a profitable business. hence, the term sheet is to set the parameters of transaction and allow the parties to outline the terms and conditions, as well as their understanding and intention in respect of the proposed acquisition, palette said. palette added that it would issue new shares in the company as payment for the gsb stake."}, "44": {"date_posted": "13/12/2016", "title": "glomac, pdz holdings, kuantan flour mills, ihh healthcare, magni-tech

rm182,000 and rm335,000 respectively, as well as a loss in fy15. the group said that while the use of high-tech print platforms is needed to remain competitive, the cost to replace old machinery and equipment in the print and packaging division is not worth the return. shares of magni-tech dropped three sen or 0.72% today to close at rm4.11 for a market capitalisation of rm667.2 million. boon

will also remain under pressure given the lack of direction from wall street that was closed for the thanksgiving holiday yesterday. the dollar surged to a near 14-year high before pulling back on thursday, clocking up records against a range of other top world currencies and skittling emerging markets, according to reuters. stronger data from the world's biggest economy had underpinned the greenback's gains, which were further amplified by thinner volumes as u.s. traders stayed away for the thanksgiving holiday, it said. it was off its highs as europe wound down but had earlier pushed its way past more of last year's peaks against the euro to reach $1.0515, with only the march 2015 high of $1.0457 standing in the way of a drive towards parity, said reuters. alliancedbs research in its evening edition thursday said the fbm klci had on nov 24 traded within previous days range to form an inside day bar as market participants chose not to stage an immediate follow through buying interest. it said in the absence of stronger buying and selling interest, the benchmark index was in the red throughout the trading sessions before settling near the days low at 1,624.21 (down 6.17 points 0.38%). in the broader market, losers outnumbered gainers with 452 stocks ending lower and 302 stocks finishing higher. that gave a market breadth of 0.66 indicating the bears were in control, it said. alliancedbs research said the inside day bar indicated a pause in the game play. it said there were buying attempts to prop up the market in the last 3 market days, but those market participants somehow became cautious when the benchmark index crossed into the 1,630 zone. this can be seen from the inability on the part of the market to sustain its position above the 1,630 level. as such, market participants would likely to continue exchanging their stock positions between 1,637 and 1,617 in a non-trending environment for a little while. a shift in market direction from non-trending to trending will be shaping up if the market were to make a higher high. this will subsequently give rise to a higher probability that the resulting short term bullish trend will be stronger, it said.  the research house said a crossover of 1,637 could send the market to the next resistance zone, 1,652 u2013 1,664, adding that indicator wise, the macd is still below the 9-day moving average line. the analysis of overall market action on nov 24 revealed that buying power was weaker than selling pressure. as such, the fbm klci would likely trade below the 1,623.61 level on

per share in third quarter ended sept 30, 2016 (3qfy16) from rm361.09 million or 9.71 sen per share a year ago, mainly due to lower net fair value loss on derivative financial instruments and lower impairment losses. genting said its revenue grew slightly by 0.8% y-o-y to rm4.683 billion in 3qfy16 compared with rm4.645 billion a year earlier. no interim dividend has been proposed or declared for the quarter. for the nine-month period (9mfy16), genting's net profit declined 4.5% to rm1.002 billion or 26.96 sen per share from rm1.049 billion or 28.22 sen per share a year before. the group's

said bids are coming in for its leasing arm asia aviation capital ltd, worth some us$1 billion, with eventual sale of the unit to take place in early 2017. this is part of the airline's plans to dispose of non-core businesses. airasia group chief executive officer tan sri tony fernandes revealed that the largest low-cost carrier (lcc) in asia will also go to the markets with two potential initial public offerings, namely its flight crew training centre airasia academy on bursa malaysia and asean holding co on the hong kong stock exchange. \"in 2017, we also hope to break ground on new

2.67 sen a share a year ago, as prizes payout for its gaming segment was lower in the current quarter. revenue, however, fell 2% to rm647.19 million in 3qfy16 from rm660.17 million in 3qfy15, on lower gaming sales as a result of intense competition from illegal operators and the weakness in consumer spending. the gaming company declared a third interim dividend of 3 sen per share for the financial year ending dec 31, 2016 (fy16), payable on dec 28. this brings total dividends for the year to 10 sen per share. for the cumulative nine months (9mfy16), its net profit dropped 22.7% to rm145.7 million from rm188.56 million a year ago, mainly due to lower profits from the gaming segment. revenue also fell 3.5% to rm2.03 billion in 9mfy16 from rm2.1 billion in 9mfy15. aeon co (m) bhd's net profit fell sharply by 81.95% to rm5.42 million or 0.39 sen per share in the third quarter ended sept 30, 2016 (3qfy16) from rm30.03 million or 2.14 sen per share a year earlier, on higher operating costs, new store and malls expense and higher interest expense. revenue for the quarter climbed 2.61% to rm965.34 million from rm940.8 million. for the nine-month period (9mfy16), its net profit declined 44.05% to rm53.2 million from rm95.09 million while its revenue rose 5.59% to rm3.02 billion from rm2.86 billion. commenting on its prospects, aeon said the economic and business environment in the final quarter of 2016 (4qfy16) remains challenging with the rising cost of living. \"the group expects its performance for the final quarter of the financial year 2016 to be equally

after foreign exchange losses on acibadem holdings non-turkish lira borrowings narrowed significantly over the year. acibadem holdings refers to ihh's wholly owned integrated healthcare turkey yatirimlari ltd group, which owns 60% of acibadem saglik yatirimlari holding a.s. group. revenue for 3qfy16 came in 18.3% higher at rm2.44 billion from rm2.07 billion a year ago on sustained organic growth at existing hospitals and contribution from new hospitals. newly acquired assets over the past year  continental and global hospitals in india, and tokuda group and city clinic group in

its third quarter ended sept 30, 2016 (3qfy16) from rm2.36 million or 0.13 sen a share a year ago, due to loss incurred in its americas segment. its revenue also fell 10.37% to rm410.65 million from rm458.18 million a year ago. the company said its americas segment recorded a loss during the period, mainly attributable to low orders secured as a result of uncertainties in oil sand development in north america as well as high project overheads. in addition, it said the group recorded a lower profit before tax for the period due to recognition of a one-off gain from disposal of its australian operations in the corresponding period last year. for the cumulative nine-month period (9mfy16), its net profit was down 57.04% to rm18.7 million or 0.88 sen per share against rm43.52 million or 2.41 sen per share in the same period last year. however, its 9mfy16 revenue increased by 4.38% to rm1.24 billion compared with rm1.18 billion a year earlier. jaks resources bhd said its net profit jumped 134% to rm13.86 million or 3.16 sen per share for the third quarter ended sept 30, 2016 (3qfy16) from rm5.91 million or 1.35 sen per share in the corresponding quarter last year. the group said its construction division was the main driver of profit growth for the quarter, partly offset by losses in the property development division amid the soft property market. \"the losses incurred were mainly due to the competitive pricing in the property market as well as higher operating and financing expenses after the opening of the evolve mall,\" said jaks. revenue for the quarter increased 83% to rm209.12 million from rm114.15 million a year earlier. \"the current quarter's revenue was contributed mainly by the construction division of rm154.7 million, of which rm94.3 million was derived from the vietnam epc construction revenue. \"the property development division contributed rm43.1 million to the group's revenue following the progress billings achieved. the trading and manufacturing divisions generated revenue of rm11.3 million in the quarter under review,\" said the group. for the nine-month cumulative period, net profit doubled y-o-y to rm24.77 million from rm12.25 million, while revenue rose 56% to rm491.05 million from rm314.25 million. malaysia's biggest lender malayan banking bhd (maybank) said on thursday it had cut its loan growth projection for the current financial year, after posting a drop in third-quarter profit hurt by a higher tax charge. net profit for july-september was rm1.795 billion (us$402.9 million), 5.4% lower than rm1.898 billion a year earlier. the lender's fourth straight quarterly drop in profit comes amid slowing loan growth at home and exposure to the oil and gas industry that has been hit by falling prices. the group lowered the full-year estimate for loan growth to 2u20133% and cut the forecast for return on equity to 10.5u201311% due to \"selective asset growth\". \"we are mindful of potential asset quality weakness in a slowing economic growth environment in some of our key operating markets,\" maybank said in a statement. \"as the group has proactively restructured and rescheduled borrowers' facilities in 1hfy16, the group continues to monitor the impaired status of these loans with the intention of recognising some recoveries in 2hfy16,\" the bank said. it added that it seeks to maintain strong capital levels, well above regulatory requirements. axiata group bhd reported a 71% fall in its third quarter net profit at rm256.56 million from rm891.39 million a year earlier, on higher operating cost. weaker financials from its malaysia and indonesia units also contributed to the group's lower net profit. mobile-telecommunication network provider axiata said revenue, however, rose to rm5.46 billion in the third quarter ended sept 30, 2016 (3qfy16) from rm5.06 billion. axiata said operating cost rose 5.1% to rm3.37 billion from rm3.2 billion. \"group revenue increased by 7.7% to rm5.46 billion in the current quarter from rm5.07 billion recorded in [the] third quarter of 2015, primarily due to contribution of revenue from nepal in 3qfy16 and higher revenues in sri lanka, bangladesh and cambodia, coupled with a positive translation impact. \"contribution of nepal as well as higher profits recorded by sri lanka, bangladesh and cambodia had a positive impact on pat (profit after tax), which was partly offset by operations in malaysia and indonesia that registered lower profits due to intense competition in respective markets and foreign currency fluctuation,\" axiata said. cumulative 9mfy16 net profit fell to rm813.75 million from rm2.09 billion a year earlier. revenue was, however, higher at rm15.78 billion versus rm14.52 billion. palette multimedia bhd plans to diversify into traditional chinese medicine (tcm) to expand its earnings base. palette multimedia said it entered into a term sheet for a proposed acquisition of a 51% stake in genopharma sdn bhd

", "article": "  telecoms giant at&ts us$85.4 billion proposal to buy time warner, if it goes through regulatory hurdles, will bring assets such as hbo, cnn, warner bros film studio and the harry potter movie franchise under what was essentially a phone company. within days of the oct 22 announcement, pundits were speculating that t-mobile would be the next attractive marriage target for pay-tv or media companies. even at&t had been eyeing t-mobile, but in 2011, it was forced to withdraw its merger bid because of antitrust-related objections. two years ago, time warner turned down 21st century foxs us$85 a share bid, which was one-fifth lower than todays offer of us$107.50 a share in cash and stock. at&t had already paid us$48.5 billion for satellite-tv provider directv and had been working on its own online video service. at&ts rivals have taken different paths. verizon, which bought huffington post and aol, looked to the worldwide web as it shelled out us$4.8 billion for yahoo! cable and broadband operator comcast  which owns nbc and universal studios and recently paid us$3.8 billion for dreamworks animation  has chosen the tangible consumer businesses and is now seen as a possible suitor for wireless carrier t-mobile. hollywood conglomerates 21st century fox and walt disney co, which are expected to raise objections to a at&t-time warner marriage, might even make their own m&a moves. disney, which has repeatedly dismissed talk of buying video streaming service netflix, owns pixar, marvel and espn. that convergence is forcing the need for telecoms, media and technology companies to transform is not new. a potential merger between billionaire ananda krishnans pay-tv and content behemoth astro malaysia holdings bhd and mobile telecoms operator maxis bhd has periodically been the subject of speculation based on their common shareholding and the billionaires deal-making skills. ananda and his associates control 64.9% of maxis and 40.98% of astro. a remarriage of telekom malaysia bhd and axiata group bhd had also been talked about since telekom added mobile services to its fold with the acquisition of p1. the latter is set to compete with other mobile operators, including axiatas celcom. khazanah nasional bhd owns 28.7% of telekom and 37.8% of axiata. khazanah also owns 20.7% of astro, which is why deals involving telekom and astro have also been bandied about. telekoms high-speed broadband offering unifi comes with internet protocol tv, called hypptv. some have gone so far as to speculate that telekoms mobile arm could be carved out for axiata and the rest merged with astro. much depends on what the shareholder [khazanah or ananda] wants to achieve, one seasoned regional telecoms analyst comments. if the shareholder really wanted to do the deal, there will be merits. whats certain is that telekom malaysia is unlikely to be able to change its minimum rm700 million or up to 90% of profits annual dividend promise, unless it undertakes a deal that significantly changes its value proposition. the company has more than once reiterated its commitment to its dividend promise. what do the ceos of malaysias four largest listed telecoms companies have to say when asked whether they expect more m&as here? we are not in a position to comment on m&a trends affecting the malaysian market. if any were possible, they would most likely occur in the more highly fragmented segments in telco-adjacent markets such as the ict space. tm itself has no immediate acquisition plans, but we remain vigilant of strategic opportunities should value creation opportunities arise, says telekom group ceo tan sri zamzamzairani mohd isa. digi.com bhd ceo albern murty reckons that telcos, in particular, may see acquisitions and strategic bets made into tech startups and digital services companies, which are a lot more aligned to leverage their core business. after all, m&a and strategic partnerships are ways organisations can scale, diversify and innovate quickly. maxis ceo morten lundal chose a more politically correct answer: on a global level, telcos have invested in a variety of companies in the last decade or so. we see some choose to acquire content providers, some do acquisitions to provide convergence in access, and others incorporate value chain service experts. there are also those who would incubate new innovations related to the internet of things. others do the old-fashioned thing by acquiring a competitor to gain the advantages of scale. there are many strategies available and im sure many companies are evaluating their positions and options in the light of industry developments affecting them. axiata group bhd president and group ceo tan sri jamaludin ibrahim has said that there will be opportunities for consolidation in several markets  that is part of a global trend  and that axiata is in a good position to participate when opportunities arise. another official with a telecoms company makes a bolder statement: there are currently five to six players in most of our markets, which we believe is more than what the market can support. the ideal number in each market should be three players, four maximum, like what is seen in most developed countries. the number one and number two players in each market typically enjoy better return on invested capital while it will become increasingly difficult for smaller operators at number three or lower positions to maintain current levels of profitability in the long run. if hes right, the need for further consolidation will eventually arise. "}, "51": {"date_posted": "16/11/2016", "title": "cover story: dividend yields the redeeming quality", "article": "  fierce competition, shrinking profit margins and unexciting growth have sadly made the once sought-after mobile service providers far less appealing now. intense competition has caused the service revenue of the big three  digi.com bhd, maxis bhd and celcom axiata bhd  to fall 4.6% year on year in the first six months of this year. as a result, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) declined 6.8% y-o-y across the board. it is evident that u mobile sdn bhd will have to be taken seriously as the fourth telecommunication company. as at june 30, the big threes aggregate subscriber numbers fell 4.6% y-o-y. in a bid to defend their market share, they have started a price war, which ultimately compressed ebitda margins by between 2 and 4.1 percentage points. u mobiles position was further cemented in late august when the government allocated an additional 2x5mhz band of the 900mhz spectrum and 2x15mhz band of the 1,800mhz spectrum to the company. adding to the already fierce competition, telekom malaysia bhd is looking to launch its own mobile service, webe, with unlimited data plans at cut-throat prices. yet, against this backdrop, the share prices of both digi.com and maxis have been on the climb since may. digi rose 17.2% to rm5.20 while maxis gained 13.7% to rm6. celcoms holding company, axiata group bhd, has bucked the trend. although its share price also rallied during the same period, it has fallen 14.4% since mid-august to rm5.08, just shy of its 52-week low of rm5.04. it is interesting to note that both digi and maxis have posted slightly higher earnings in the third quarter. digis net profit grew 10.3% y-o-y to rm438 million while maxis expanded by almost 20% to rm503 million. maxis core net profit, however, rose only 0.8% after adjusting for foreign exchange and accelerated depreciation. note that axiatas financials have yet to be released. the group usually releases them later than maxis and digi since it needs more time to consolidate the accounts of its foreign operations. digis earnings rebound was attributed to a substantial rationalisation of its international direct dialling (idd) segment. although digi lost 138,000 prepaid subscribers in 3q2016, it is quite evident that these are low-quality and/or multi-sim subscribers as arpu (average revenue per user) remained flat. most of the churns are coming from the migrant workers segment, following digis decision to move away from the irrational idd price war and reduce its dependency on voice idd revenue, explains alliancedbs research in a report. overall, digi saw subscriber numbers fall by 98,000 or 0.8% quarter on quarter. after three consecutive quarters of growth, this is the first contraction for the group in one year. the good news is that digis postpaid subscribers continue to grow, up 2% q-o-q to 1.99 million. however, postpaid revenue fell marginally by 0.6% q-o-q to rm489 million as arpu moderated to rm80 a month. meanwhile, prepaid subscribers fell 1.3% q-o-q to 10.26 million. on a more positive note, digis prepaid revenue stabilised, marginally unchanged at rm1.06 billion in the quarter despite losing subscribers. digi is possibly the telco with a brighter outlook. having the lowest gearing of 0.4 times net debt-to-ebitda certainly helps. at the very least, the group will have no problem funding the spectrum reallocation of rm599 million. nonetheless, there are 11 sell calls on the stock against five buy recommendations, according to bloomberg. there are also 13 hold calls. the average target price is rm4.72  6% lower than digis closing price of rm5.02 last week. the outlook for maxis is less favourable. there are 15 sell and 14 hold calls on maxis, bloomberg shows. the average target price is only rm5.43  9.5% below last wednesdays closing of rm6. most analysts have their reservations on maxis ability to sustain its dividend per quarter of five sen. the main source of maxis woes is its high gearing of 1.7 times net debt-to-ebitda. if the group pays the spectrum fee of rm817 million up front, it will push its gearing up to two times net debt-to-ebitda by year end. the alternative is to cut dividends, say analysts. as it stands, maxis is being valued at a dividend yield of 3.3%, assuming dividends are maintained at 20 sen per share. in contrast, digis yield is 4.2% and axiatas, 3.4%. a closer look at maxis third-quarter numbers reveals little indication that the telco will be able to drastically turn around its bottom line. to its credit, the group has been able to defend its ebitda margins. in fact, they rebounded to 52.8%, five percentage points higher than a year ago. the problem is, maxis continues to lose subscribers. its prepaid subscribers fell 1.2% q-o-q to 8.01 million while its postpaid subscribers rose 0.6% to 2.68 million in the quarter. it is the first quarterly growth in postpaid subscribers after nearly five consecutive quarters of contraction. however, the slight increase in postpaid subscribers was dampened by a 1.5% q-o-q fall in postpaid revenue  the fourth quarterly decline thus far. although the subscriber trend has turned positive, the postpaid segment still posted lower revenue as intense competition pulled down arpu from rm102 to rm100 in 3q2016, writes alliancedbs on maxis. in a nutshell, maxis users have been using more data but they have not been paying more for it  a result of the price war. it remains to be seen how well celcom will hold up in the third quarter. in past quarters, however, it tended to underperform both maxis and digi. looking ahead, there is still an upside catalyst for the telcos share prices. an interest rate cut would make the telcos yield relatively more attractive. the last interest rate cut of 25 basis points in may to 3% sparked the current rally in their share prices. economists are anticipating rate cuts of up to 50 basis points next year, possibly split between the first half and second half of the year. fortunately for the telcos share prices at least, a falling yield environment will make them relatively more attractive to institutional investors. but that is assuming the telcos can maintain their dividend payouts.

smartphone that transformed the telecommunications industry and spurred many new ways we now use our mobile phones. having fast internet access anytime, anywhere has also come to pass in developed and developing cities where most people constantly have at least one mobile device within their reach. self-driving cars, washing machines that start operating when the electricity rates are at their cheapest and billboards that differentiate whether you are a man or a woman before showing you gender-specific advertisements are no longer works in progress. virtual reality headsets already allow people to travel and have a 360u00b0 view of new places that their physical (and financial) abilities might never take them to. within the next decade, these innovations and many more could well be commonplace with the right ecosystem in place. refrigerators that prompt you to buy milk and provide recipe suggestions based on the ingredients you have inside them are several years old in us test environments. with your permission and access to your e-wallet, these fridges can even buy milk and have it delivered in time for your morning coffee or muesli when supply runs out. but digital innovation is not just about making peoples lives better and creating new ways of doing business. nor is it just the telecoms and technology industries opportunity to rejuvenate sales and profit as they strive to win and keep customers. whats at stake is a countrys ability to remain competitive as the world undergoes the fourth industrial revolution, which professor klaus schwab, founder and executive chairman of the world economic forum (wef), says goes beyond automating production and is characterised by the fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital and biological worlds. it is disrupting every industry in every country. and the breadth and depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production, management and governance. the possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity and access to knowledge are unlimited. and these possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the internet of things (iot), autonomous vehicles, 3d printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage and quantum computing, schwab writes in an op-ed in january, where he also outlined concerns about governments inability to employ and properly regulate these technological advances. consumers now have new opportunities for work and play, but there is also a need to equip the workforce with new skills, especially those whose jobs are at risk of being taken over by machines. businesses are also forced to transform: hotels and taxi companies are finding out quickly with the advent of airbnb and ride-hailing services like uber and grab. even before that, film and music companies were already contending with online piracy and are today looking for ways to monetise content online. among the many industry incumbents, at the forefront of the digitisation wave are telecommunication companies that have spent billions the past two decades building the enabling network infrastructure for fast internet connection on the go. they are faced with a quandary, now that mobile phone penetration rates are well above 100% and billions in lucrative long-distance phone calls and text messages are almost history  thanks to over-the-top (ott) applications like whatsapp, skype and facetime that essentially piggyback on the telecoms network without spending to build them. in 2014, operators around the world reportedly lost us$14 billion in revenue because of a decline in voice and traditional messaging traffic. already, some experts see phone users having closer ties with the likes of facebook and google (think gmail account and your default search engine) rather than telecom operators. yet, for as long as phones still need to run on the latters networks, the jury is still out. telcos can stay as a dumb pipe and continue providing the basic network or be a smart pipe and build new business advantages to seize growth opportunities in the digital space, including moving into adjacent service industries such as advertising, e-commerce and content delivery. japans softbank group, which last week committed us$25 billion to a us$100 billion tech investment fund bearing its name, is the earliest and among the most aggressive in asia. softbank is already reaping the benefits of the 32% stake in alibaba group it bought 16 years ago for a mere us$20 million. softbank still has a 28% stake in alibaba after it sold us$8 billion worth of the stock recently. across the causeway, singapore telecommunications ltd, which in 2012 set aside s$2 billion to ramp up digital investments, has spent more than half that sum to date, including us$321 million for its digital advertising platform amobee in 2012 and us$770 million for cybersecurity unit trustwave last year. it also invested in advanced analytics by buying dataspark, mobile streaming service hooq and has a venture capital arm, innov8, to explore digital innovations. apart from trustwave, singtels group digital life investments are still a drag on its profit and are expected to record negative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) of s$150 million to s$180 million for the current year ending march 31, 2017. still, singtels fy2015 profit in us dollar terms was still four times that of malaysias regional telecom operator, axiata group bhd. similarly, softbanks was nine times larger  allowing both players greater flexibility for sizeable acquisitions.  balancing investments and returns axiata has a different strategy: we have to invest in our digital future. there is no question about it  we have to do so for the growth and sustainability of our business. our strategy focuses on integration with existing core business  either today or in the future, says tan sri jamaludin ibrahim, axiatas president and ceo. according to him, there are two components to axiatas transformation into a digital company. the first is the digitisation of its core processes such as e-care, real-time marketing analytics and network virtualisation, and these require a change in mindset and the upgrading of digital skills. the second component is to provide new services to expand axiatas core business such as mobile advertising, digital commerce and digital entertainment. fortunately, digitisation of the core does not incur huge investments, but it does require a lot of effort. it is critical, and if done well, will even lower our future operating costs. we have started embarking on these initiatives, and in some markets, we are way ahead while in others, we are on a par with our competitors. we plan to be even more aggressive in the future, jamaludin says. he admits that providing new digital services could involve significant investments as well as a long gestation period, depending on the extent and scope. the latter may not sit well with financial investors, who, as experts at citi research puts it, justify their investment by dividend yield arbitrage, network investment-driven growth recovery, or a combination of the two. still, these two investment strategies may have passed their peak: we think that monetary policy and industry (technology and regulatory) cyclicality pose long-term fundamental challenges to both stories, citi researchs experts write in a recent note. axiata is looking to balance the need to invest in its digital future and delivering returns to stakeholders as it transforms itself into a new-generation digital company. we strongly believe that we have to do both and are prepared to be penalised in the short term. we have a strong conviction of what is best for axiatas future. fortunately, all investors appreciate and support the digitisation efforts and the need to change to a digital mindset and skill set. and fortunately too, most of our investors support modest, thoughtful and strategically rationalised investments in digital services. we have adopted a modest investment policy to do this and have restricted our digital service investments to 2% to 5% of our total investment each year, jamaludin says. that 2% to 5% works out to rm110 million to rm275 million (us$26 million to us$66 million), based on axiatas fy2016 capital expenditure guidance of rm5.5 billion. if distributed, it would be about one sen to three sen per share  an amount that financial investors can probably stomach. so far, axiata digital services had accumulated 28 brands, including its digital commerce ventures in indonesia and malaysia  elevenia and 11street  that collectively generated us$126.6 million gross merchandise value as at end-2015. as at end-2015, axiata digital has focused investments in five key business verticals, namely digital advertising, e-commerce/marketplaces, mobile money, digital entertainment and education, disruptor models and ott enablement platforms. elsewhere, axiatas operating units have seen strong usage growth for their mobile money ventures in cambodia, bangladesh, sri lanka and indonesia. axiata also has experience running a pay-tv service through dialog tv in sri lanka. among its new ventures in recent years, edotco  axiatas tower infrastructure business  has piqued investors interest as minimising network duplication is one way to cut cost and increase returns on investments. malaysia-centric telcos are also investing for the future. we have a solid track record in moving fast and smart ahead of every industry cycle, and have an ambition to take a stronger position in the daily digital lives of our customers, digi.com bhd ceo albern murty says, adding that significant investments are being made to deliver new digital services to enrich the user experience. in june, digi-x was set up to create standalone digital businesses, develop new business streams through acquisitions and investments, deepen digital partnerships and footprint in the start-up ecosystem as well as build and monetise digital platforms for the core business. through [digi-x], we have invested in a selected few start-ups, made headway and seen more opportunities in the financial services and internet of things (iot) verticals. the deregulation of other industries going forward will also give us the opportunity to offer more m2m services to new customers, he says, adding that digi also benefits from parent norwegian telenor asas reach in 13 markets as well as investments such as new york-based ad tech company tapad and malaysia-based licensed money service business prabhu money transfer. over at maxis bhd, group ceo morten lundal says the company took a big step towards new ways of working and digitalisation for businesses with its vodafone partnership. by pairing our local market knowledge and leading high-speed data network with vodafones managed iot connectivity platform, we are now offering enterprises world-leading iot solutions to create smarter, more efficient businesses, lundal says. we are not basing our future on non-traditional income, we focus on a differentiated high-quality empowerment of our customers by leveraging internet. we will continue to develop our capabilities as we evolve to digitalise maxis. relevant to this is our ambition to be the preferred choice for partnership for any world-class solutions or service providers. we welcome all partners with mutual intent and look forward to delivering the best range of choices to our customers. strong initiatives have also been taken by convergence champion telekom malaysia bhd (tm), whose units have been chosen by at least malaysian resources corp bhd (mrcb) and aspen group to deploy connectivity and iot smart solutions at selected real estate developments towards delivering that enhanced digital lifestyle for more malaysians. its unit, vads lyfe sdn bhd, for example, is also working with cyberview sdn bhd on an iot-based traffic-light system in cyberjaya to help cut waiting time and improve traffic flow. tm is poised to promote smart services through the provision of iot-enabled services and smart solutions for smarter living, smarter businesses, smarter cities, smarter communities and smarter nation, which encompass but not limited to smart safety and security, smart mobility, smart building management and tenant and citizen services. these are in line with our vision, to make life and business easier for a better malaysia. we also leverage our next generation network and ict solutions to co-create an infrastructure and services that can boost the overall industries in malaysia, says group ceo tan sri zamzamzairani mohd isa. commendable as these efforts are, it remains to be seen whether larger investments need to be made as the leaders of this new age speed ahead in deriving meaningful social and economic impact from new technologies. malaysia was not among top innovative countries with digital successes  finland, sweden, norway, singapore, switzerland, the us and the netherlands  where the wef found to have a high rate of business ict adoption as well as a top innovation environment. based on the networked readiness index 2016 in the wefs global information technology report, malaysia was ranked 31st of 139 (32nd of 143 in 2015) with 4.9 points versus 5.6 to 6 points for the top 15 countries. while malaysia ranked 21st when it comes to regulatory and business innovation environment, the country ranked 73rd on the readiness sub-index because we were at no 46 on skills, 71 on infrastructure and 91 on affordability. within the affordability pillar, malaysia was ranked 110th on fixed broadband internet tariff and 45th on prepaid mobile tariff but first place when it comes to internet and telephony competition. that could mean more pressure on local operators to provide better services for less money. will this nudge industry consolidation? (see are conditions ripe for another malaysian mega merger? on page 69) rather than just delivering cheaper price points for consumers, what is needed to push malaysia ahead is the realisation that holistic change is imperative as laggards will be swept aside.

believe axiata is able to pay down debt levels from asset monetisation exercises, such as the potential initial public offering of edotco group sdn bhd mooted by end-fy17.  we expect axiata to report a subdued second half in fy16 due to the weaker operating environment across major operating companies. xl axiata, recently reported a weaker 3qfy16, while associates idea cellular and m1 also reported disappointing earnings. nonetheless, we continue to believe in the long-term strategy of the group  in particular, xls rebranding strategy to capture the mid-to-premium subscriber segments,

was at 11% as of october 2016, since 2011. maintain neutral with a revised sum-of-parts-based tp of rm5.20, which implies a forecast of fy17 for enterprise value-to-ebitda ratio of 7.6 times, a 22%

1,652.55 points. yesterday, the index rebounded and rose 8.7 points to 1,661.25 points. the performance was in line with performances of global markets. trading volume continued to increase. the

balancing act ", "article": "  over the past decade, khazanah nasional bhds portfolio has performed quite admirably. from rm40.5 billion in 2005, the funds net worth adjusted (nwa) has grown 169% to rm108.9 billion as at dec 31, 2015. last week, the state-owned fund decided to take some profit as it trimmed its holdings in tenaga nasional bhd (tnb) by 1.45 percentage points. the disposal of 82 million shares, at rm14.30 per share, raised rm1.17 billion for khazanah. with tnbs share price up by almost 23% y-o-y, khazanah certainly cannot be faulted for taking profit at these levels. but the timing of the disposal does raise questions about how the funds will be deployed. the 2017 budget will be revealed in a months time, and it is no secret that the federal government is walking a tightrope in keeping the budget deficit at 3.1% this year with the fall in petroleum revenues. recall that khazanah last year paid out almost 100% of net profits in dividends  a record high. for fy2015, the fund paid dividends of rm1.05 billion against net profit of rm1.055 billion. post-dividends, khazanah only retained rm5 million. keep in mind that khazanah also had to fund the rm6 billion turnaround of malaysia airlinen system bhd, now known as malaysia airlines bhd (mab). against this backdrop, khazanahs borrowings shot up to rm46.46 billion, up 9.54% y-o-y, giving it a net gearing of 1.2 times as at december 2015. note that this takes into account the fact that khazanah last year raised rm1.6 billion from the disposal of 112 million tnb shares. furthermore, it excludes the us$750 million (rm3.15 billion) in us dollar-denominated straight sukuk that was issued in february this year. khazanah declined to comment for this story. a further cause for concern was the seemingly urgent nature in which the block of 82 million tnb shares were placed out last week. according to industry sources, the shares were placed via an accelerated book-building exercise. on top of that, the transaction price of rm14.30 was at the low end of the book-building range. it would be worrying if khazanah was forced to make less-than-ideal disposals in order to maintain dividend payouts. but to be fair, the tnb shares were disposed of at near-peak prices. furthermore, khazanah retains 28.26% equity in tnb worth rm22.9 billion. beyond tnb, khazanahs holdings in listed companies were estimated to be worth rm89.77 billion as at last friday. other than tnb, khazanahs seven listed stocks include axiata group bhd in which it has a 37.77% stake, cimb group holdings bhd (29.81%), ihh healthcare bhd (41.12%), uem sunrise bhd (66.06%), telekom malaysia bhd (28.65%) and malaysia airports holdings bhd (mahb) (36.71%). unlike tnb, however, the rest of the stocks on the portfolio have produced a lacklustre performance this year. mahb was the only other stock to gain substantially, up 17.6% y-o-y. ihh healthcare, uem sunrise and telekom all gained less than 3% y-o-y. meanwhile, cimb and axiata lost 5.46% and 12.41% of their market value in the same period. in a nutshell, if khazanah needs to trim its holdings in its listed companies to raise capital, this is not the right time. separately, khazanah has also explored other means to raise fresh capital. at the beginning of the month, it raised us$398.8 million (rm1.62 billion) from the issuance of an exchangeable sukuk for beijing enterprises water group ltd  an integrated water and sewage treatment solutions service provider in china. to be fair to khazanah, it does not appear to be milking its companies simply to upstream the dividends. the clearest example of this is the fact that axiata reduced its interim dividend by 15%, from eight sen per share to five sen per share (see story on page 20). it is also important to point out that khazanahs dividend contribution to the government is relatively small compared to the national budgets expenditure, which came to rm267 billion for 2016. in contrast to other revenue streams like the goods and services tax, which is expected to rake in rm39 billion this year, khazanahs contribution is also not significant. however, dividends alone may not be the only demand on khazanahs capital. mabs turnaround, while on track, is far from complete and still requires support from khazanah (see story on page 28). on top of that, the fund earlier this month announced that it would be developing taman tugu  a 26.7ha rainforest park that will cost an estimated rm650 million. note that about rm100 million of that budget is set aside for the maintenance and operation of the park over the next 12 years. put it all together and it is clear that steering khazanah is not an enviable task. (interestingly, khazanah last week saw a new addition to its board  second finance minister datuk johari abdul ghani.) the fund needs to pay dividends to a cash-strapped shareholder but paying too much could stifle the impressive growth that it has enjoyed over the past decade.

while myeg services bhds financial year ended june 30, 2016 (fy16) revenue was up 99% year-on-year (y-o-y) at rm281.6 million, net profit growth was even stronger at 141.8% y-o-y to rm142.9 million, mainly due to greater economies of scale. a 1.3 sen final dividend per share (dps) was declared, in line with our expectations. for fy16, myeg is paying a total dps of 1.8 sen, equivalent to a 30% net dividend payout ratio. on tuesday evening, myeg also announced a proposed one-for-two bonus issue, which was a positive surprise. although the government has not announced any extension of the rehiring programme (registration of illegal foreign workers [ifws]) since end-june, a check on myegs website shows that the rehiring programme is ongoing. as at end-june, the company had registered 300,000 ifws, and in our forecast, we assume that the company will register an additional 700,000 ifws in fy17. we understand that the government has asked the courts to impose harsher punishments on employers that continue to hire ifws. since april, the myeg-celcom axiata bhd joint venture has started supplying celcom sim cards to foreign workers. the average revenue per user (arpu) is currently rm35. we assume a conservative rm25 arpu and the company getting 7% of the proceeds in a revenue-sharing scheme with celcom. we estimate that by 2017/2018, more than two million foreign workers will be holding celcom sim cards. myegs balance sheet was rm102 million net cash or rm4.3 net cash per share as at end-june. capital expenditure (capex) for phase 1 of the gst monitoring project (gmp) has been completed. we believe that myeg may need at least another rm300 million for phase 2 capex, but this should be adequately financed through operational cash flows. myeg is diversifying into a new business, that of providing hostel accommodation for foreign workers. the first hostel was launched recently in melaka, and we believe the company is targeting to provide these services nationwide in the next two to three years. the average rental is rm200 per month. the country will have an estimated three million registered foreign workers in 2017, and even if the company can provide accommodation for just 20% of them, annual revenue from this business could hit rm1.4 billion in three years time. we maintain our earnings per share (eps) forecasts and add new fy19 numbers. in view of the strong 52% three-year eps compound annual growth rate outlook, we raise our tp from rm2.68 to rm3.22 as we value the stock at a 20% premium to 21 times price-earnings ratio target for the sector for 2017. rerating catalysts include stronger-than-expected registration of ifws and a successful launch of the gmp. downside risks include further delays in the gmp launch.  cimb research, aug

2016 (4q16). while not yet available to non-tm customers, the current webe 4g long-term evolution (lte) plan is priced at rm199/month, excluding the goods and services tax (gst) for the rest of the malaysian public. malaysians who are interested to sign up for the webe 4g lte service may register their interest on the webe website. in our view, webe is likely to offer plans to the public with much lower pricing terms, similar to the offer to its existing subscriber base. recall that on june 30 this year, webe unveiled its 4g lte postpaid plan priced at rm79 per month with unlimited internet data, unlimited calls and smses only to existing tm and packet one networks (m) sdn bhd subscribers. for tethering via the webe mobile plan (using wi-fi hotspot and webe internet on the computer), an additional rm6 will be charged for two hours, excluding gst. additional webe lines will also be offered at discounted rates. given that webe offers unlimited data, the wi-fi hotspot option is offered in case of issues with its data speed and quality as the network currently deploys tmgos 850mhz band while sharing celcom axiata bhds 2g and 3g infrastructure for areas beyond its coverage. at such low prices, it is unlikely for webe to break even in the next few years given that webes losses widened to rm124 million, from rm103 million in fourth quarter financial year 2015 (4qfy15) largely due to accelerated depreciation and impairment for worldwide interoperability for microwave access (wimax) assets, which will be replaced by lte equipment. as we expect tm to package its webe offering together with the groups other services to provide a solution to customers, the potential cross-subsidies among the groups operations are likely to maintain pressure on the its margins. hence, webes losses are projected to continue but at a slower pace, given that mobile operators such as maxis bhd and celcom will have a head start in offering combination packages. our channel checks indicate that cellular companies do not expect webes free data option at such low prices to be sustainable in the longer term, when its subscriber base has reached near its competitorsscale. hence, we maintain fy16 to fy18 earnings, pending the announcement of its results on aug 30. the stocks fy17 price-earnings ratio of 24 times is near its one-year average of 25

like the relative strength index and moving average convergence divergence show that market confidence is getting stronger. the fbm klci is below the ichimoku cloud indicator, but is currently below a thin cloud. this indicates that the fbm klci is set to move into correction after staying sideways for the past one month. furthermore, the bollinger bands have become very narrow, and hence a strong movement is expected if the bottom top band is broken. the market may rebound or continue its bearish trend and this depends at which level the fbm klci breaks. if the index breaks above the resistance level at 1,640 points, then we expect the index to at least test the short- and long-term 30-day and 200-day moving averages at 1,660 points. however, a breakout below the support level at

only reach a high of 1,631.12 as market participants decided not to play a buying game. it said that in the absence of stronger buying support at 1,631.12, renewed selling pressure chipped in to push the benchmark index down to a low of 1,623.58 before settling near the days high at 1,630.96 (up 5.12 points or 0.31%) in the last few minutes buying of selective blue chip stocks. in the broader market, losers outnumbered gainers with 510 stocks ending lower and 302 stocks finishing higher. that gave a market breadth of 0.59 indicating the bears were in control, it said. alliancedbs research said the lower low on may 25 indicated that sellers were in better control over the buyers. buyers apparently were not keen to establish stock positions because they did not want to see their investible money locked in the market for no good reason. given a choice to trade, market participants chose to play on the selling side as there had been a tendency of the market to drift lower in

to move between 1,620 and 1,637 in the coming few days, it said. the research house said a fall below 1,620 would put pressure on the market to test the recent low of 1,611 (may 16). it said that

recovery from its two month low set on friday. japan's nikkei gained about 1.0 percent, it said. hong leong ib research said it was still of the view that contrarians might start to nibble on weakness

malaysia weekly, on february 8 - 14, 2016   wharever the reason behind the sudden announcement of telecommunications spectrum optimisation and the foreign labour levy hike, the market found it hard to swallow. thats going by the over rm20 billion of market value lost by the larger affected companies  led by mobile telecommunications companies and oil palm planters  netting out gainers when some details of the bad news post budget 2016 revision hit the ground. whats exasperating is the manner in which details such as the quantum of the foreign worker levy and redistributed spectrum block sizes were being decided and released, industry insiders and market watchers say. their grouses in summary: why was the industry not consulted? is this final or will there be more surprises in the coming weeks? while some of the larger stock market losers the past week include exporters like glove-makers and chip-makers  which benefitted from the weaker ringgit and are now seeing prices coming off on profit-taking after the ringgit firmed against the greenback from 4.2525 on jan 27 to 4.1452 on feb 4  there is real concern over whether companies and businesses affected by policy changes can transform themselves quickly enough to emerge stronger from the policy change. felda global ventures holdings bhd (fgv) president and ceo datuk mohd emir mavani abdullah, for instance, issued a public appeal asking the government to reconsider its 154% levy hike for foreign estate workers. the sudden move would push the companys costs up drastically, he said in a feb 3 statement, pointing out that the palm oil industry as a whole has been affected by the slump in cpo price to a six-year low last august and a stronger greenback. the real estate and housing developers association malaysia (rehda) also said they are totally caught by surprise over the sudden announcement. rehda malaysia president datuk seri fd iskandar said the 100% hike for construction workers will definitely have adverse effects on the real estate industry, which already faces higher costs. we are deeply concerned that such a steep increase would not only negatively impact businesses but ultimately, the unattainable cost increase would be passed down to consumers, thereby hampering the affordable housing agenda, he added in a statement, suggesting that the government raise revenue through better enforcement rather than a levy hike. while malaysia wants to encourage companies to cut dependency on cheap labour and invest in automation to raise productivity, it is impossible, for instance, to expect labour-dependent sectors such as plantations and construction companies to instantly change, experts say. can malaysia stay competitive enough for local and foreign investors to invest and stay invested here? an observer asks. deputy prime minister datuk seri ahmad zahid hamidi  who announced on jan 31 that the government expects rm2.5 billion additional income from the 100% to 300% higher restructured levy for foreign workers that came into effect on feb 1  on feb 3 reportedly said the government will not hesitate to look into the issue though the new rates are enforced effective feb 1 after planters, manufacturers, builders and service sector business groups made strong statements against the move. it is not immediately certain whether the rm2.5 billion mentioned was already included in the revised budget 2016 assumption, where government revenue was projected to fall rm7.8 billion to rm9.4 billion, largely from oil-related sources, while operating and development expenditure will be cut rm8 billion to rm9.5 billion as the government reduces supplies and services and reprioritises projects. the fees telecoms operators will have to pay the government for their reallocated spectrum blocks are also still unknown at the time of writing, but these have not been included into the revised budget 2016 assumption. whats evident, however, is that malaysias total market capitalisation was down rm22.3 billion over two days post the levy shock (as at feb 3)  nearly 10 times the rm2.5 billion in extra income the government expects to collect from the revised levy rates  before the government signalled room for negotiation. the precipitous value lost due to the cost-related shock could have been avoided with proper consultation with local players. and although bursa malaysias total market capitalisation was over rm8 billion higher than before the levy shock as at last thursday (feb 4), half of those gains were from axiata group bhd and maxis bhd, whose collective market capitalisation on feb 4 was still rm6.5 billion lower compared to before the revision of budget 2016. put another way, total market gains could have been higher had there not been those sudden huge losses for telecoms and plantation stocks. as stock market gains are also seen as a wealth creation factor, a decline implies wealth destruction, an observer says. stock prices of real estate companies such as s p setia bhd, uem sunrise bhd and ioi properties bhd were not as badly affected as planters and telcos, collectively falling only about 1.4% or about rm350 million, bloomberg data show, possibly because the sector was already experiencing slower growth. large planters such as sime darby bhd, ioi corp bhd, kuala lumpur kepong bhd, genting plantations bhd and fgv, on the other hand, lost about rm7.8 billion or about 5.5% of market value over two days post the levy hike shock. the largest losers were malaysias top three mobile operators, which were hit on infrastructure cost, potentially lower customer spending as well as their ability to keep up good dividend payments. maxis, axiata (which wholly owns celcom axiata) and digi collectively coughed up a whopping rm12.7 billion or 9% of their collective market value over two days on jan 29. some rm9.5 billion in market capitalisation lost on jan 28 alone when the governments intent to optimise revenue from the telecommunications spectrum through a redistribution and bidding process was first announced by the prime minister during the budget 2016 revision. it seems the decline presented a buying opportunity for some investors, possibly one reason for some recovery. at the time of writing, stock exchange filings show the employees provident fund, for instance, buying digi shares on jan 29 after selling on jan 27 and 28. the epf had 14.247% of digi as at jan 29, above the 14.156% it had on jan 26. closing at rm4.98 last thursday, yield was 4.4% based on the lowest fy2016 dividend forecast of 22 sen apiece. the epf was also a net buyer of maxis shares on jan 28 and 29, with its stake at 7.7% as at jan 29, compared with 7.57% on jan 27. for maxis, implied yield was 3.25% at rm6.15 last thursday, assuming it pays 20 sen dividend in fy2016. to be sure, the government and bursa malaysia are doing their bit to woo investors abroad. datuk seri abdul wahid omar, minister in the prime ministers department and head of the economic planning unit, engaged over 80 fund managers with us$15 trillion under management in hong kong and singapore to speak on the growth and

indicated that the trend is still bullish in the short term. the index is also above the ichimoku cloud indicator, but on a thin cloud. this indicates that the bullish trend is still in an early stage. the fbm klci seemed to be struggling to climb above the long-term 200-day moving average. this average, together with the downtrend line (line r1 on the chart) is currently the technical resistance level, and ranges between 1,680 and 1,690 points. momentum indicators indicate that the bullish trend is still well supported. the relative strength index indicator is increasing steadily above its mid-level, while the moving average convergence divergence indicator remains above its moving average. furthermore, the fbm klci is still trading near the top band of the bollinger bands indicator. however, the bands stopped expanding and this indicates a slightly weaker momentum. the market is in a cautious mode after a rally post chinese new year. the fbm klci is at the 200-day

digi.com bhd was one of those stocks that investors wished they had bought on hindsight for its exceptional returns since 2007 without relying on borrowings. now, the stock is about 17% below its all-time high recorded in late-february 2015 and twice as many analysts are calling a sell on the stock as the six recommending a buy. twelve others are neutral, according to bloomberg data. from early 2015, digi has declined nearly 16%  twice as much as the bellwether fbm klci. by comparison, its larger rival maxis bhd has lost less than 4% of its value. so, what gives? more importantly, is it time to reconsider ones shopping list? going by the lowest fy2016 dividend per share (dps) forecast of 22 sen apiece, yield was 4.26% at digis rm5.16 close on jan 14. the implied yield would be even higher at 4.65% if the dps assumption was 24 sen  which was the projection for fy2015 and is below the fy2016 consensus forecast of 24.7 sen and the 26 sen paid in fy2014. by comparison, yield compressed to below 3% at telekom malaysia bhd, whose much sought-after minimum rm700 million annual dividend promise works out to 18.63 sen at its current share base and 2.85% yield at its rm6.55 close last thursday. yields are 3.4% and 3.7% on consensus dps of 22 sen for fy2015 and 24 sen for fy2016. if one were to assume a 3.5% yield on the lowest dividend forecast of 22 sen, digis shares should fetch 22% more at rm6.29 apiece. the upside is over one-third if one were to assume the richer consensus payout of 24.7 sen for fy2016. that digis 2015 earnings are likely to come in lower year on year and remain lacklustre in 2016 is a big concern, says a seasoned analyst. the ringgits depreciation has meant more expensive international traffic charges for digi and [2015] ebitda will likely be lower y-o-y. indeed, digis ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) for the first nine months of fy2015 only made up 72% of what it made in the whole of 2014 while 9mfy2015 net profit fell 8.9% y-o-y to rm1.34 billion. digi paid 5.1 sen dps in 3q2015, bringing its total dividend for the three quarters to 17.1 sen or rm1.33 billion. the full-year 2015 dividend would be 22.2 sen if digi pays 5.1 sen dps in 4q2015. even if one assumed 20 sen dps for fy2016  the lowest payout per share since 2012  digi should fetch 10.7% more at rm5.71 for a 3.5% yield. to be sure, there are valid operational concerns. a quick look at the 3q2015 numbers for digi, celcom and maxis shows digi lagging behind both maxis and celcom in terms of y-o-y financial performance. maxis was in the lead in terms of revenue, ebitda and ebitda margins as well as subscriber base. some 85% of digis 11.7 million subscribers are in the prepaid segment, which is perceived to be more price-sensitive than the postpaid segment. this is larger than the 75.8% at maxis and 77.6% at celcom. this is why any movement in the prepaid segment, which could be hit by weak consumer sentiment, is seen to have a bigger impact on digi. it is worth noting that with 9.93 million prepaid users, maxis has slightly more of them than digis 9.9 million and celcoms 9.71 million as at sept 30, 2015. a maxis user also pays an average of rm49 a month  higher than rm45 a month at digi and celcom. the trio account for some 85% of malaysias total mobile subscriber base. yet, based on 3q2015 numbers, digi has more flexibility in balance sheet capacity. its net debt to ebitda is only 0.32 times currently, even with lower ebitda assumptions this year, back-of-the-envelope calculations show. maxis net debt to ebitda multiple is about 1.8 times, telekom malaysias (tm) is 0.8 times while celcoms parent axiata group bhds is between 1.5 and 2 times following its nepalese acquisition, which it said would add to its dividend paying capacity. if nothing else, these figures give digi the option to maintain dividends even as it works out a strategy to win more earnings and boost margins. at the time of writing, bloomberg shows target prices for digi ranging from jp morgans rm4.20 to bimb securities rm6.80 and averaging at rm5.33 apiece. if digi can pay the consensus dps of 24.7 sen for 2016, its shares should fetch rm7.06, assuming a 3.5% yield. if dps is only 20 sen for 2016, digi would fetch rm6.67, assuming a 3% yield. there are those who reckon that norways telenor asa  which owns 49% of digi and previously considered adopting a business trust structure for the latter to release more cash  may have less of an incentive for a large payout when the ringgit is weak. there is also concern that digi, which paid more than its rivals for its 3g spectrum, may face similar circumstances should regulators call for a spectrum re-farming in the coming three to five years. in the meantime, investors would need to currency-adjust their expected returns based on their assumption of the ringgit. still, it is worth noting that the employees provident fund and its portfolio managers were net buyers of digi, maxis, tm and axiata shares last year. between end-2015 and now, stock exchange filings show that the epf continued to buy digi and axiata but took profit in maxis on jan 12 and in tm on jan 11. the epf still held 16.23% of tm (14.73% at end-2014), 14.55% of axiata (13.54% at end-2014), 14.13% of digi (13.27% at end-2014) and 7.45% of maxis (6.46% at end-2014) at the time of writing. the holdings of these four stocks alone could potentially rake in rm720 million to rm880 million in dividends this year or about 13% of the rm5.6 billion to rm7 billion that digi, maxis, axiata and tm are projected to pay this year. thats important, given that the epf needed rm5.41 billion to pay every 1% of dividend in 2014, up from rm4.91 billion in 2013. this figure is likely to

technical rebound last week as i had expected. it was supported by both a stronger ringgit and rebound in crude oil prices. however, the market pulled back yesterday for a correction after the holiday on monday. the bank of japans decision to have negative interest rates shows that it does not want people to keep in banks, and hopefully to channel their money into investments. the local market performance was in line with regional market performance. the benchmark fbm klci increased 1.6% in a week to 1,653.18 points yesterday. plantation and energy stocks led, while telecommunications weighed down the market. the ringgit strengthened against the us dollar from rm4.25 to a us dollar a week ago to rm4.21. trading volume declined last week as the market stayed cautious. the average daily trading volume in the past week was 1.9 billion shares compared with 2.1 billion shares two weeks ago. however, the average trading value rose from rm2 billion to rm2.7 billion, and this indicates more higher-capped stocks were being traded and foreign institutions reversed their selling spree. foreign institutions started accumulating after many weeks of selling on a stronger ringgit. net buying (from tuesday to thursday last week) from foreign institutions was rm1.236 million, while net selling from local institutions and local retailers were rm1.119 million and rm117 million respectively. gainers trashed decliners 13 to two in the fbm klci last week. the top gainers for the week were sapurakencana petroleum bhd (+10% in a week), rhb capital bhd (+9.2%) and

yesterday. the fbm klci rose above the short-term 30-day moving average after last weeks increase. this indicates that the index is bullish in the short term. however, the index is still below the long-term 200-day moving average and the downtrend line (r1 on the chart). furthermore, the index is still not able to climb above the ichimoku cloud. the resistance, based on the downtrend line and the 200-day moving average, is at 1,690 points. momentum indicators are starting to show that market sentiment is turning bullish. the relative strength index and momentum oscillator indicators increase above their mid-levels, and the moving average convergence divergence crossed above its moving average. however, the bollinger bands continued to squeeze and the fbm klci was not able to climb to the top band of the bollinger bands. market momentum is bullish in the short term. however, it has to overcome the resistance level at 1,690 points to boost market confidence. with the resistance, we expect the market to be buoyant this week, staying at levels between 1,650 and 1,690 points. i guess this will be the chinese new year rally. sectors to keep in your watch list are plantation, oil and gas, and rubber product makers. heres wishing all readers a happy chinese new year and gong xi fa cai. benny lee is chief market strategist for jupiter securities sdn bhd. jupiter

aged above 21 years. chin teck has oil palm estates in pahang, kelantan and negeri sembilan, with a total 11,327 ha of planted land area. it has replanted 846 ha or 7.5% of its oil palms in 2015, and plans to replant 960 ha or 8.5% more this year. goh, who was speaking to reporters today after the group's annual general meeting, also attributed chin teck's weaker earnings recently to cpo prices, which have been relatively weak in the past two years. wz satu bhd, which has an exclusive mining contract to mine bauxite ore in kuantan, aims to match the last financial year's profit for its mining segment in the current financial year ending aug 31, 2016 (fy16), driven by improved productivity post-moratorium. its chief executive officer tengku datuk seri uzir ubaidillah said although the three-month ban on production will affect the group negatively in the short term, due to operational costs in terms of idle machines and manpower, wz satu is confident that it will be able to recoup the lost revenue through increased productivity after the moratorium. at a press conference after the group's annual general meeting today, uzir said he believes that this three-month moratorium would be beneficial for wz satu because it would weed out the ones that are non-conforming to regulations. once wz satu is allowed to continue production and sales in april, uzir said he hopes the group can recover the loss in these three months by being more productive. practice note 16 (pn16) company kejuruteraan samudra timur bhd (kstb) is proposing a regularisation plan that will pave the way for the

thinning profit margins from heightened competition, plus the need to continually invest to keep up with the quality of service to satisfy customers, have become the push for marriage among providers of both fixed line and mobile phone services from europe to asia. in britain, the uks largest broadband provider, bt group, has mounted a u00a312.5 billion takeover of mobile operator ee  some 14 years after bt spun off its mobile arm o2. hong kong-based hutchison whampoas mobile operator, three, which proposed to buy o2 from telefonica for u00a310.25 billion, reportedly argued to the european competition watchdog that the three-o2 merger should be allowed for them to better compete with bt and vodafone. other proposed mergers in recent years include wind and 3 italia in italy. to be sure, not all mergers worked out. norwegian telenor asa and swedish teliasonera failed to merge their respective danish mobile operations and in the us, at&t withdrew a proposed merger bid for t-mobile usa in 2011, following antitrust-related objections. while regulatory issues are a concern, it is not likely to stop all marriage plans. in fact, the uks competition and market authority said a bt-ee merger is not expected to substantially reduce competition. for axiata group bhd, president and group ceo datuk seri jamaludin ibrahim says the group continues to be for consolidation wherever it makes sense to acquire or form partnerships. in every country, were thinking proactively and reactively who to buy and who not to buy. we were thinking of bangladesh for the last two years before we found someone to merge with. its the same for indonesia and sri lanka, jamaludin says, adding that any m&a would be opportunistic u2026 unless it is too good to forgo. he qualified, though, that axiata is not going around with a big cheque book for shopping, but will consider any deal that either supports its core business or expands and enhances its core competences. i dont think we are going to be very aggressive u2026 the focus is primarily consolidation. weve done four already. two very small ones in sri lanka, one medium-sized in cambodia, a large one in indonesia [axis] and weve just announced a mou in bangladesh, he says. robi axiata, bangladeshs second largest operator by revenue, entered into a joint venture with trust bank to provide mobile financial services, just weeks after announcing a partnership with digital security provider gemalto nv. yet for investors looking at malaysia, the biggest question of all is possibly whether khazanah nasional bhd will decide to again merge its regional mobile champion axiata group bhd with telekom malaysia bhd. with its acquisition of green packet bhds packet one sdn bhd (p1), telekom is seen as a formidable challenger to malaysias big three mobile phone operators: digi.com bhd, maxis bhd and celcom axiata bhd. the mobile operators, in turn, lease fibre capacity from telekom, which spent over rm10 billion on building a high-speed broadband (hsbb) network and received co-investments from the government to expand that network to areas that might not immediately be commercially profitable. khazanahs decision in late 2007 to spin off telekoms mobile operations into todays axiata, created an investor favourite in telekom as it offered steady dividends at a time of record low interest rates as it invested to build the hsbb network. unless it announces a policy change, telekom continues to be the only stock on bursa malaysia with a minimum dividend promise  a minimum of rm700 million a year or up to 90% of its profit. axiata, meanwhile, offers the dual proposition of growth from its investments in emerging markets with some stability in yields."}, "91": {"date_posted": "30/11/2015", "title": "ock expects major contracts from local telco operators", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on 30 november, 2015.   kuala lumpur: telecommunication (telco) base transceiver station (bts) builder ock group bhd, expects to clinch two major contracts from local telco operators by the first half of financial year ending dec 31, 2016 (1hfy16), continuing the growth momentum in the groups top line. in an interview with the edge financial daily, group managing director sam ooi chin khoon revealed that the two major contracts are both construction jobs. bts, or more commonly known as telco towers, are used to transmit signals between operators call centres and mobile devices. in malaysia there is plenty of work at the moment. we probably might announce one or two very big contracts that we will sign very soon. i think next year (fy16) we can enjoy similar growth like this year from our current businesses, he said. last week, ock announced that net profit for 3qfy15 jumped 62.24% to rm4.89 million from rm3.01 million a year ago, while revenue leaped 74.62% to rm83.7 million from rm47.93 million a year ago. in the nine-month cumulative period (9mfy15), ocks net profit rose 44.55% to rm13.09 million from rm9.05 million last year, while revenue increased by 64.21% to rm210.13 million from rm127.97 million. along with the quarterly report, ock also disclosed that a memorandum of understanding (mou) had been entered into between the group and its myanmar partner, king royal technologies co ltd, with telenor myanmar ltd. the mou is for the building and leasing of tower infrastructure to telenor. all parties aim to conclude the agreement in the next few weeks. the contract being negotiated is for 12 years, and involves building 920 three-legged towers on a build-and-lease basis, with an expected completion date in 2016, with telenor having two-month exclusivity to lease the facilities. this means that after the two-month tenure, ock could lease the infrastructure to more tenants. a typical three-legged tower would usually cost about us$80,000 (rm341,000) to construct. ooi said ock would normally aim to achieve an internal rate of return (irr) of 15% in build-and-lease projects. an irr of 15% is meant for one tenant, if we manage to secure more tenants to lease the tower, then it (irr) will be more than that, he explained. suppose the group manages to seal a deal with telenor, ooi said ock is confident of clinching more contracts in myanmar. there is no agreement for the construction of a second batch of towers, but if we make a success out of the first project, i think we stand a good chance to win the second one from telenor, he said. other than myanmar, the group also has presence in cambodia and indonesia. for 9mfy15, 15.73% of ocks revenue came from outside malaysia in the asean region. this compared with 5.33% in the previous corresponding period. ooi said that ocks project in cambodia involves dredging and laying works for 800km of fibre for telecom cambodia, the countrys state-owned telco company. in indonesia, he said ock is only involved in maintaining bts for the countrys telco tower companies. currently, we are maintaining about 20,000 bts in indonesia. we prefer not to own bts there as there are a lot of bigger telco tower companies in indonesia, it is difficult for us to compete, he said. locally, ooi said competition among telco operators bodes well for ock as the former will invest more in bts construction. i think the construction business [of bts] will still be strong for the next two years, due to the lte (long term evolution) deployment, he said. ooi reckoned that telco operators that have deployed lte like maxis bhd, digi.com bhd, axiata group bhd, u mobile sdn bhd, and packet one networks (m) sdn bhd, will need another two years to complete the coverage in malaysia. telco tower is a very unique industry, when one operator spend, the rest will follow. for fy16, we already have 250 bts in the pipeline, all under the build-and-lease model, and we will try to secure more, he said. ooi also mentioned that ocks margins for the construction of bts are quite attractive, especially those awarded by the malaysian communications and multimedia commission (mcmc). we provide a combination of maintenance, roll-out, equipment servicing, optimisation, drive-test, margin from some of these specifications are quite good, but if doing just the civil works, then the margin might be low, he explained. ooi revealed that the gross margin for mcmc projects could go up to 30%.  apart from bts construction, due to the lte deployment, ooi said local operators are working to replace microwaves in signal transmission technology with fibre optic cable. lte involves bigger data traffic, so fibre cable can increase the speed and capacity of transmission compared with microwave. in malaysia, we have nearly 25,000 bts, operators are fiberising their signal transmission technology, he said. therefore, i think more fibre trenching works will be deployed moving forward, and ock now is one of the biggest fibre contractor for operators in malaysia, ooi added. one of the fibre trenching works ock secured in 1hfy15 was from maxis, with an estimated value of rm25 million. ock (fundamental: 1.6; valuation: 0.8) closed 1.5 sen or 2.17% higher at 70.5 sen last friday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm546.7 million. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated

valuation: 2.40) and malakoff have the added advantage of not being exposed to fluctuations in fuel costs that tnb bears. that said, tnb (fundamental: 1.30; valuation: 2.40) gets aaa ratings for its borrowings because it controls a structural monopoly of the transmission and distribution of electricity. when it comes to high debt levels, the real concern is over companies whose businesses could be disrupted by a sudden downturn in the business cycle, or those that have a big mismatch between the currency of revenue and the currency of their debts  airlines, for instance. over 80% of airasia bhds (fundamental: 0.20; valuation: 1.40) rm11.81 billion debts were in us dollars as at december 2014. since the beginning of this year, the ringgit has depreciated 15% to 4.02 against the us dollar. the weakening ringgit creates a headache for airasia. however, low jet fuel prices will be a panadol to help ease the headache, notes maybank investment bank aviation analyst mohshin aziz. in the first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1qfy2015), airasia saw an unrealised loss on foreign exchange of rm536.1 million arising from its borrowings. fortunately, due to the groups hedging, the net foreign exchange loss was rm350.1 million, including rm11.13 million in realised foreign exchange losses. airasia had hedged 43% of its us dollar-denominated borrowings. while the low-cost carriers bottom line will be hit by losses on foreign currency translation, it should not affect the companys core earnings, says mohshin. of course, there will be a translation loss, but we dont look at it when it comes to core earnings. the us dollar borrowings that airasia has are for 12 years or more ... plenty of time for the ringgit to rebound, he points out. in the meantime, airasias cash flow should cover the higher interest rate payments on these borrowings, he says. airasias load factors rebounded to 80.1% in 2qfy15 following the loss of indonesia airasias flight qz8501 late last year, which caused a fall in ticket sales in 1q. sapurakencana petroleum bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 0.80) is the only non-utility in the top five companies with the most borrowings. the oil and gas services provider has over rm15.56 billion in net debt, a net gearing of 128%. it has over rm13.9 billion in us dollar-denominated debts or 81.6% of gross debts. in the near term, foreign exchange losses are expected to eat into sapurakencanas earnings. on the bright side, most of its revenue is denominated in us dollars, which is normal in the oil and gas industry, thus neutralising the foreign currency risk. it is common for oil and gas companies to have high us dollar-denominated debts. perdana petroleum bhd and perisai petroleum teknologi bhd have 96% and 98% of their debts denominated in us dollars, respectively. however, both perdana (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 0.80) and perisai (fundamental: 0.30; valuation: 1.70) have lower levels of gearing than sapurakencana  0.87 and 0.92 times respectively. it is important to note that sapurakencana also has a much stronger earnings pipeline to support its debts, for now. the group has a decent order book of rm25 billion. the challenge, however, will be in sustaining order book replenishment, with crude oil prices averaging us$59.93 a barrel this year. perisai, which also provides offshore support services, saw a 77% decline in its core net profit to rm2 million in the second quarter this year. perdana posted a 71% drop in core net profit to rm6 million due to lower utilisation of its vessels. nevertheless, jobs have not dried up completely. sapurakencana last month won a rm1 billion contract from indias oil and natural gas corp ltd. still, sapurakencana has high expectations to meet when it comes to order book replenishment. analysts expect the group to bag rm6 billion to rm8 billion in new contracts this year. with oil majors scaling back exploration and production, this will put pressure on the companys heavily geared balance sheet going forward if the situation does not improve. in contrast, most of the other companies on the list (table 1) have relatively sheltered revenue streams. axiata group bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.10), maxis bhd (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 1.10), and telekom malaysia bhd (fundamental: 0.80; valuation: 1.10) have high borrowings to fund their initial capital expenditure. however, with telecommunications an everyday necessity, it is unlikely their earnings will take a big hit in the event of an economic slowdown. in fact, such companies are valued as defensive stocks when there is a slowdown.  group exposure interestingly, many of these companies with high foreign currency borrowings are government-linked corporations. (see table 2). the khazanah nasional group of companies has racked up over rm41.67 billion in net debt. with the exception of uem sunrise bhd (fundamental: 1.50, valuation: 2.60), most of the companies would be considered to have stable cash flows. still, uem sunrises gearing is relatively low at 0.27 times. furthermore, the group has a vast landbank, which can be sold to support its debts. hence, while the debts seem high, the khazanah companies should be able to weather the volatility and service their debts. tan sri syed mokhtar albukharys group of companies has a different risk profile. mmc corp bhd is heavily vested in construction, which tends to be a cyclical industry that seems to have reached the peak of the cycle. at least mmc (fundamental: 0.40, valuation: 2) has been able to reduce its gearing substantially since malakoff ceased to be its 51%-held subsidiary post-listing, allowing mmc to deconsolidate malakoffs debts from its books. drb-hicom bhd, however, may be a concern to syed mokhtar. the latest available total industry volume figures show a sharp decline in automotive sales this year. proton, which is under drb-hicom, was no exception with year-to-date sales falling 23% to 32,652 units as at april. the silver lining for drb-hicom is that there has been a 27% increase in sales volume for honda cars, which the group assembles. other marques that drb-hicom assembles include mercedes-benz and volkswagen. however, with consumer confidence hitting new lows, softer automotive sales could pose a challenge for drb-hicom, especially if it allows inventories to build up. moving forward, volatility isnt all doom and gloom for investors. while the weakness of the ringgit will hurt the bottom lines of some companies, it will also create opportunities for long-term investors who have confidence in the underlying fundamentals of companies and their resilience in a down cycle.  note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a

global implications' - zeti", "article": " keynote address by governor of bank negara malaysia tan sri dr. zeti akhtar aziz kuala lumpur (aug 17): the increasing role of the renminbi in the global financial system from a trade currency to an investment currency and now its potential role as a global reserve currency will have significant global implications. i am delighted to be here this morning to speak at this renminbi forum. the renminbi sphere has indeed extended beyond the asian region, extending to other continents, to europe, latin america and the middle east. the renminbi is no longer an asian story, but it has now become a global story. it reflects china's importance and influence in the changing contour of the global economic and financial landscape, and the steps that have been taken to enhance its international role. my remarks today will focus on the increasing trend of the internationalisation of the renminbi despite the recent challenges faced in the chinese economy; the implications of this trend to the region and finally on the steps that malaysia has taken as the region transitions into this environment. long-term prospects for the chinese economy and the renminbi after decades of rapid growth, the chinese economy is now transitioning to a growth path that is more sustainable. it is important to recognise that the moderation in the chinese economy has been in part, policy-driven, through conscious reforms to restructure the economy to become more balanced and domestic demand-centric. these economic reforms have been accompanied by financial and exchange rate reforms, geared towards modernising the economy and financial system that is increasingly more integrated with the global economy. these reforms are mutually reinforcing as the transformation of the structure of the chinese economy is necessary to support its integration with the world economy and the international financial system. the commitment to these reforms is crucial in securing the long-term growth prospects for china, even as the chinese economy faces short-term challenges in the recent period. the recent one-off adjustment of the renminbi reflects a conscious effort by china to align the renminbi to a market-driven mechanism as a part of a crucial reform to allow the renminbi to reflect financial market developments and economic fundamentals. in an environment of continued weakness in global trade, these short-term challenges include managing the ongoing corrections in the real estate sector, leverage in the financial system and more recently, the volatility in the stock market. while these uncertainties may generate concerns over the renminbi in the near term, it needs to be recognised that the long-term growth prospects for china remain intact, and that this will continue to strengthen the foundations that will support the transition of the renminbi as an international reserve currency. china has a high rate of savings, healthy external position, an inherent competitive mass manufacturing advantage and a large educated workforce to sustain its long-term potential economic growth. importantly, the narrative of the global future of china cannot be explained in isolation  it is part of a broader account of the growing importance and greater integration of asia, and the stronger interlinkages with other emerging economies in the global economic landscape. china and the region are becoming more than just global exporters. the increased efforts are seen in the steps to develop more extensive investment and financial linkages in the region as well as the rest of the world through key strategic initiatives such as the one belt one road initiative, the asian infrastructure investment bank and the new development bank. reflecting its expanding role in the global economy and the international financial system, the renminbi will assume greater strategic importance in facilitating the development of these new investment and financial linkages, including meeting the greater demand for infrastructure spending. this is also reinforced by the transition of asia from a global producer to a global consumer thus becoming an important driver of growth in the world economy. the rise of the renminbi is often associated with expectations of rapid capital account liberalisation. in this regard, the historical experience of the major currencies over the recent fifty years holds important lessons for the renminbi. many advanced economies continued to retain significant capital account restrictions until early 1980s, later than the internationalisation process of their currencies that began in earlier decades. such evidence suggests that the transition of the renminbi as an international currency can commence with the gradual and sequential liberalisation of the capital account. china's position on a 'managed convertibility' approach instead of the traditional 'fully or freely convertible' can therefore be appreciated given the lessons from the global financial crisis and the risks associated with volatile capital flows even for such a large emerging economy like china. it is important to note that china has made significant progress in this area. this is even acknowledged by the imf in its recent reports as they note that china has already achieved full or partial convertibility in 35 out of 40 items under the capital account. the rise of the renminbi and its implications while the path for the renminbi to be a fully international currency will remain gradual, the renminbi has already achieved significant milestones. it is now the second most used currency globally for trade finance and the fifth most used currency for global payments. one-quarter of china's total trade is now invoiced in renminbi, and this is expected to double within the next five years. by some accounts, more than sixty central banks around the world already hold renminbi in their official reserves. the rise of the renminbi as an international currency would facilitate trade, investment and financial activities that are commensurate with the continued growing importance of china in the global landscape. of significance to the asian region, the rising importance of the renminbi will reinforce the trend towards greater regional financial and economic integration. china is already the main trading partner for most economies in the region. the increased usage of the renminbi and the more developed regional financial markets for the renminbi provides an opportunity to recycle savings within the region and thus support the increased intra-regional investment activities. more renminbi-based trade within the region will create pools of renminbi liquidity which would create a demand for instruments which would in turn spur the development of more efficient and integrated renminbi capital markets in the region that can contribute towards better intermediation between the surplus and deficit units in the region.\n\nin addition, the renminbi can be a source of stability for the global monetary system. the increasing use and recognition of the renminbi as an international reserve asset will strengthen the foundations of the current global monetary system that is currently reliant on too few major currencies. with the increased economic and financial interconnectivity in the world today and the greater potential for international policy spillovers, a more multipolar global monetary system with more diverse sources of global liquidity would contribute towards a more stable international financial system. looking ahead, these developments present tremendous opportunities for the private sector. indeed, trade invoicing in renminbi has already begun to spread beyond predominantly chinese enterprises to multinational companies (mncs) turning to china as a key market for their products and services. notably, despite the initial difficulties in operationalising the renminbi-based system, some mncs have successfully upgraded their global invoicing and payment systems to settle trade and working capital in renminbi with their chinese counterparts. this allows for significant cost-savings on foreign exchange transactions in addition to efficiency gains from matching trade receipts to funding working capital requirements. the increased use of the renminbi for their investment activities in china is supported by the flexibility provided in china for movements of global funds in and out of the country. the potential longer-term benefits from using the renminbi-based system for their trade, working capital requirements and fdi in china is thus seen to clearly outweigh the implementation costs. in the more recent decade, financial investments have also gathered momentum as foreign investors commenced investment activities in chinese financial markets since 2003 through the qualified foreign institutional investor (qfii) program. wide-ranging measures, including the introduction of china interbank bond market (cibm) foreign quota in 2009, the renminbi qualified foreign institutional investor (rqfii) in 2011 and the operationalisation of the hong kong-shanghai stock connect in 2014, are all aimed at encouraging greater participation of foreign investors in china's mainland financial markets. at the same time, china is improving the global renminbi settlement and clearing system through a wider network of renminbi clearing banks and the upcoming cross-border interbank payment system (cips) to lower the transaction costs for the renminbi relative to other major currencies. currently, there are at least five hundred global investors, including sixty or more foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds, that have gained direct access to china's financial markets. many more have access through the hong kong-shanghai stock connect. malaysian institutional investors seeking to internationally diversify their investments would need to intensify the learning curve process in the chinese financial markets to realise its benefits. malaysia: a pioneer in the cross-border use of the renminbi malaysia was one of the earliest countries to recognize the potential role of the greater cross-border use of renminbi. given china's significance as malaysia's largest trading partner, the settlement of trade and investment in renminbi significantly lowers costs and promotes greater cross-border trade and investment activity. in turn, fund-raising activity in renminbi has become a means for malaysia to utilise the renminbi liquidity obtained through trade settlements. malaysia has a comparative advantage in this area, as the largest debt securities market in southeast asia and as a leading centre for sukuk issuance. as an early pioneer of renminbi initiatives, bank negara malaysia (bnm) was the first asean central bank to sign a currency swap agreement with the people's bank of china (pbc) in february 2009. in the same year, bnm was also the first asian central bank to become a qfii investor and among the first wave of foreign investors in cibm. in 2010, the malaysian ringgit became the first emerging currency to be directly traded with the renminbi in the china foreign exchange trading system (cfets). in 2013, bnm signed a cross-border collateral arrangement (cbca) with pbc to enable the use of home currency collateral to obtain domestic liquidity in the host country. in november 2014, bnm signed an mou on a renminbi clearing bank arrangement. the bank of china malaysia was appointed as the renminbi clearing bank in january 2015. going forward, bnm will work towards further enhancing financial co-operation with pbc in the area of renminbi qualified foreign institutional investor (rqfii) to provide an alternative avenue for malaysian investors to invest in onshore chinese financial markets. bnm has also worked to integrate the renminbi into the domestic financial system by incorporating the renminbi in malaysia's real time gross settlement system (rentas). in november 2013, bnm introduced the renminbi liquidity facility (rlf) to licensed onshore banks to facilitate more effective renminbi liquidity management in malaysia. today, the usage of renminbi in malaysia has grown rapidly, with the daily size of renminbi foreign exchange volume at rmb6.7 billion. malaysian institutions and corporations such as khazanah, cagamas, axiata and maybank have issued renminbi bonds. with the various renminbi financial infrastructure that has been put in place to support trade, investment and financial flows between malaysia and china, this trend is expected to increase. malaysian entities with large regional network should consider using malaysia as the centre for their regional renminbi transactions and thus contribute towards greater economies of scale over time. this would in turn enable the transactions to be conducted in the most efficient and cost effective way. conclusion let me conclude my remarks. in a short time span of six years since 2009, the renminbi has accomplished much of its goals but there is still a long journey ahead as most international currencies have evolved over several decades. the impact of the chinese economy on asia has been significant with many countries now counting china as their largest trading partner, and in some cases, among the largest foreign investors. reflective of the underlying fundamental economic changes, the rise of the renminbi, although gradual, is inevitable with important implications not only to asia but to the rest of the world. undoubtedly, the renminbi is more important to asia than anywhere else. given this, asia including malaysia must be ready for this transition of the increased internationalisation of the renminbi and its potential role with asia's integration path and thus contributing towards further unlocking the potential of the region.   bank negara malaysia\naugust 17, 2015 "}, "107": {"date_posted": "11/8/2015", "title": "maybank ib sees opportunities amid volatility", "article": " kuala lumpur: despite internal and

currently serving out the notice, says a source. celcom, a unit of axiata group bhd, said it was not able to comment on the matter at press time. it is unclear whether the scheme is a prelude to a bigger reorganisation programme by the telecommunications company (telco). be it a bloated workforce or harsher operating environment, axiata is among the latest to offer a separation scheme to cut costs. malaysian employers federation executive director datuk shamsuddin bardan was quoted by news portal the malaysian insider last month as saying that about 20% of its members were looking at such an option. they cut across all economic sectors, from retail and hospitality to manufacturing. he said companies were finding it more difficult to meet overheads because of weaker demand, especially post-goods and services tax. the federations membership comprises about 5,000 companies and 22 trade associations. two recent high-profile separation schemes were those by malaysian airline system bhd and cimb group holdings bhd. the national carrier, which is laying off 6,000 employees, is probably the first among government-linked corporations to carry out such a massive job cut. cimb has just

telecoms businesses, which could contribute to its lower valuation. it has a dividend yield of between 3% and 3.5%. axiatas mobile subsidiaries and associates operate under the celcom brand name in malaysia, xl in indonesia, dialog in sri lanka, robi in bangladesh, smart in cambodia, idea in india and m1 in singapore. additionally, the group has set up a communications infrastructure solutions and services company called edotco group. for the financial year ended dec 31, 2014 (fy2014), axiatas ebitda dipped 3.7% to rm7 billion while profit after tax and minority interests fell 7.9% to rm2.3

the back of higher revenue contribution from all key companies, notes axiata, in its results announcement. operating costs rose 10.4% to rm3 billion in 1q2015 from a year earlier, due to higher

said. mtouche in february this year entered into an exclusive licensing and revenue-sharing agreement with indonesia's pt inovisi infracom tbk to grant the latter the rights to distribute, market and commercialise one krypto in indonesia, thailand, greater china, japan and south korea. in april, mtouche also signed a master application and content provider agreement with celcom axiata bhd to provide celcom subscribers with the one krypto application. zakhir said the need to develop new mobile applications comes at a time when its core business of providing mobile content and short messaging services is experiencing stiff competition. we needed to supplement the business and decided to go into the niche market of secured communication. however, we will continue to focus on our core business (short messaging servicing and mobile content provision) because it is still generating revenue for the group,\" he said. we spent a substantial amount [of money] on research and development in fy14 and fy15, which saw our operating expenses increase to create [new] products, including a collaboration with taiwan-listed arbor technology corp plc to develop internet of things and smart city solutions in malaysia, he said. zakhir also said its mobile device management application, that enables user administrators to control the usage of the internet at corporations and homes, is expected to be commercialised in 2qfy16. mtouche (valuation: 0; fundamental: 1.35) shares closed up 3.57% to 15 sen last friday, with a market capitalisation of rm31.24 million. the edge

industry is fragmented and challenging, says century logistics holdings bhds managing director steven teow. but, he adds, i think we have got the formula right for ourselves. the integrated solutions provider has re-engineered itself and now specialises in three core services  integrated logistics, oil logistics and procurement logistics, he tells the edge. we also have a fourth engine of growth, which is a new business for us  data management solutions services, in which we help clients store files physically and electronically. the bread and butter of century logistics (fundamental: 2.6; valuation: 2.4)  the integrated logistics business that provides total logistics solutions to its clients  accounted for 72% of the groups revenue and 58% of operating profit in 2014. the oil logistics segment accounted for 18% of revenue and 31% of operating profit for 2014 while procurement logistics accounted for 10% of revenue and 11% of operating profit. the group provides total logistics solutions, starting with the procurement of raw materials, port and customs clearance, international freight forwarding and assembly to inventory management and distribution. we add value to our customers businesses by improving their efficiency through the provision of cost-savings measures, says its chief financial officer and director edwin yeap. research by frost and sullivan shows that in malaysia today, only 10% of consignment shippers and manufacturers outsource their logistics on a contract basis to a logistics provider like us, whereas in scandinavia, it is as high as 40%, he observes. so, we believe there is a lot of growth in contract logistics, whereby the customer outsources completely its logistics needs to a service provider like us. an analyst with kenanga research says global logistics companies will end up being clients of local players. the foreign players dont want to overload themselves with assets and are more in the courier game ... they rent space from local guys such as century logistics. meanwhile, to ride this demand, century logistics has to maintain these warehouses and increase volume, he adds. in a may 18 report, kenanga notes that the demand for warehousing space is increasing. with industrial land in the klang valley getting more expensive, more and more manufacturers have outsourced their logistics functions. we understand that a growing number of mncs are receiving global mandates to outsource their logistics services. in addition to costs savings and better specialised services, outsourcing also allows manufacturers or companies to focus on the core operation of their businesses, it says. century logistics key customers include f&n, celcom axiata, lg, singer and haier.  yields above industry average, per below at its close of 90.5 sen last thursday, century logistics was trading at nine times price-earnings ratio (per) and had a dividend yield of 5.19%. the stock is undervalued and the company is in a resilient business. it is trading lower than the industrys per of 12 times and higher than the industrys average dividend yield of 2.9%, says an analyst covering the stock. century logistics net asset value stood at 76 sen per share as at march 31. on may 18, kenanga issued a trading buy call on century logistics with a fair value of rm1.19, based on 12.5 times fy2016e per -- a 35% discount from the overall average derived from global logistics companies. on top of that, we are projecting dps of 5.5 sen and 5.0 sen, respectively, for fy15 and fy16, which translate into a yield of 6.4% and 5.8%, says kenanga. century logistics appeal lies in the expectation of solid earnings growth, averaging 19% per annum over the next two years, ability to secure new contracts underpinned by its track record with established clientele and decent dividend yield projections, the research house adds. according to teow, century logistics is trying to achieve its rm500 million turnover target within the next two to three years, and is targeting rm300 million this year. the group, he adds, is also looking at expanding its warehouse capacity to five million sq ft. the group currently manages two million sq ft of warehouse space, 1.5 million sq ft of which it owns. cash call not needed for current expansion plans in anticipation of rising demand for warehouse space, century logistics will invest rm90 million in building a new multilevel facility on an eight-acre parcel at eastern gate way industrial hub in klang. scheduled to be completed in 2017, the new building will expand the groups warehousing space by 450,000 to 600,000 sq ft. asked if the group plans to make a cash call for the undertaking, yeap says there is no need for it. our current net gearing is below 0.1 times and we do not expect it to exceed 0.4 times with the borrowings for the new multi-storey warehouse. our cost of borrowings is below 5% per annum. according to teow, we are in advanced talks to secure a 10-acre piece of land in pelabuhan tanjung pelepas (ptp) in johor. this is part of plans to expand our capacity. we currently have four facilities in ptp and they are all at full capacity. we expect demand for warehousing to increase and there is also the spillover from singapore. for this new piece of land, we target it to be purpose-built and we want it to be used for long term contracts  five years plus five years. the groups oil logistics business had suffered a setback due to the termination of operations at pasir gudang port in johor at the end of 2011. however, century logistics managed to salvage this business and now has three floating storage units (fsu) in ptp in johor. the fsus are used for the blending, storage and offloading of oil. the drop in oil prices does not affect our business by much as we only offer the service to oil providers; we do not take a position on the oil price, says yeap, adding that another fsu will be coming on stream this year. as for its procurement logistics segment, teow says century logistics had to reinvent itself and keep up with the changing landscape. we shifted from oem to procurement, assembly and repackaging services. there is potential in this business, [and] we need to work with the right partners for it. for example, we used to assemble television sets for syria  it was a good business model  but we had to stop because of the sanctions. we are now studying potential new countries to replicate that model, he says. century logistics also found a new client  global electronics player philips  at the end of last year for the procurement logistics business, teow says. this helped strengthen the groups bottom line in the first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1q2015). century logistics saw its 1q2015 net profit rise 25% year-on-year to rm7.8 million. for the financial year ended dec 31, 2014, its net profit expanded 48% to rm33.3 million. teow has an 11.8% stake in century logistics while his uncle datuk phua sin mo, who is the groups chairman, has 26.7%. asked if he would consider being bought out, teow replies: everything has a price, but just to note, i am in this for the long term. note: the edge

lumpur: the competition among malaysias telecommunication companies (telcos) is expected to intensify, weighed down by the impact of the implementation of the goods and services tax (gst). in a note to investors last friday, cimb research analyst foong choong chen said the research house maintains its underweight rating on the telco sector as financial results for the second quarter of 2015 (2q2015) and 3q2015 are likely to disappoint the market. we cut our financial year 2015 to 2017 ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) and core eps (earnings per share) forecasts for digi.com bhd, axiata group bhd and maxis bhd to factor in more intense price competition in the prepaid mobile market, and less benefits from passing through the 6% gst to prepaid users as the regulators have decided to charge gst upon usage (that is subscribers may pare down usage) rather than on top of the usual top-up card prices, foong noted. putrajaya had on may 13, almost 45 days after the implementation of gst, announced that gst will not be imposed on prepaid reloads but will be based on usage, which would result in lower usage from subscribers. when contacted, an analyst from hlib research told the edge financial daily that despite the downside, telcos might be able to see some relief in 3q2015, during the hari raya celebration and the school holidays. moreover, the 3q and 4q are traditionally the better quarters for telcos. alliancedbs research analyst toh woo kim concurred, and stressed that there will still be growth in the industry, but at a slower pace. therefore, he particularly favours telekom malaysia bhd (tm), which is secluded from the mobile operators competition. the competition now is intense, despite the fact that revenue from mobile internet is increasing, but revenue from voice and sms (short messaging services) are declining as well, he told the edge financial daily. previously, the big three (maxis, digi and celcom) would always try to maintain their prices, but now, even they are competing with lower priced products, toh added. foong also noted that industry mobile internet revenue rose 3.4% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q), but was more than offset by 5.4% and 14.2% q-o-q decline in voice and sms respectively. an analyst who declined to be named, pointed out that maxis (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 1.1) and celcom axiata bhd, a unit under axiata (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.1), is fighting aggressively for more market share in the migrant workers and rural segment, by offering products with lower international direct dialling (idd) rates. with the intensified competition in the prepaid market, digi (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 1.7) would have been negatively impacted as its prepaid market leadership came under heavy attack from competitors, foongs report noted. digi declined by 11% to rm5.51 yesterday, from rm6.22 per share on april 1. meanwhile, shares of maxis and tm (fundamental: 0.8; valuation: 1.1) were up by four sen (0.62%) and nine sen (1.32%) respectively to close at rm6.53 and rm6.92 a share. axiatas share price fell one sen or 0.15% to rm6.49 per share. the edge

swiss luxury watchmaker jaeger-lecoultre have stepped in as sponsors for the edge billion ringgit club (brc) 2015. in its sixth installation, the brc aims to recognise malaysias largest corporates for jobs well done  not only in raking in profits but also in corporate responsibility (cr) efforts. ocbc has been the main sponsor since brcs inception in 2010. senior vice-president and corporate and commercial banking head jeffrey teoh says awards like the brc act as an incentive for companies to adopt a holistic approach to doing business. he says that the purpose of business is increasingly recognised as a platform for providing meaningful service to humanity, with profits being the means by which to keep such a meaningful entity viable. i think a company exists as part of a whole ecosystem in terms of regulators, shareholders and stakeholders, he says. so, if you dont have an event to recognise that, it is all for naught, it is not sustainable. he says ocbc enjoys being a part of the annual event, not so much as an aid to brand building, but because it is the right thing to do. i think the not-so-obvious elements [in business] such as how you operate in an environment where there is growing awareness of cr, how we function in an economic manner without destroying the environment and how we operate in a manner where we give opportunities for malaysians to broaden their talent ... these things do not get much coverage, but thats why i think the brc is very different compared with other awards, he says. it is more holistic. it is a more balanced scorecard. jaeger-lecoultre malaysia country manager reena tan says brcs high standard of assessment, which is based on quantitative and qualitative criteria, sets the event apart from the others in the business community. i think it is important to give recognition to corporations that have done tremendously well all round, not just in terms of profits but also their contributions to the malaysian society, she says. as jaeger-lecoultre, too, plays a big role in cr, it has had a strong partnership with unesco (united nations educational, scientific and cultural organization) since 2008, to protect the 47 marine areas listed as world heritage sites. she says that the company has even made a short video titled the guardians on glacier bay national park. the us national park is a hotbed for marine biodiversity, recognising the work of scientists and project managers in preserving the site. the chief executive officer (ceo) of the brc company of the year award winner will receive a master eight days perpetual 40 watch. the watch has a perpetual calendar and boasts an eight-day power reserve, thanks to its twin barrels that store up a considerable amount of energy.  technically programmed to require no manual correction before the year 2100  even the noblest mechanisms cannot keep track of the century years that are not leap years  it will continue to provide an accurate display of the date, the day of the week, the month and the year in four digits, along with the power reserve, the moon phase, the alternation between night and day, and even the security zone between 10pm and 3am during which no changes must be made. tan says the watch is a symbol of the values inherent in exemplary leadership and for steering a company to the billion-ringgit mark. jaeger-lecoultre is a visionary brand that celebrates accomplishment in fine watchmaking, combining elegance and confidence, she adds. hence, our values are, in a way, a fine representation of the corporation/ceo who will be receiving the jaeger-lecoultre timepiece. the brc recognises companies with a market capitalisation of rm1 billion and above as at march 31 each year. the shortlisted companies, which are added to the annual list automatically once they fulfil the requirements, are evaluated based on growth in profit before tax, returns to shareholders and cr commitments, among others. the cr initiative component is evaluated by a panel of judges, which includes an ocbc representative. the brc awards include malaysias outstanding ceo, most profitable company, highest profit growth company and best performing stock. previous winners of the malaysias outstanding ceo award were public bank group chairman tan sri teh hong piow, cimb group chairman datuk seri nazir razak, ammb holdings bhd chairman tan sri azman hashim, airasia group ceo tan sri tony fernandes, former malayan banking bhd president and ceo datuk seri abdul wahid omar and former s p setia bhd president and ceo tan sri liew kee sin. last year, dutch lady milk industries bhd clinched the company of the year award while sunway group founder and executive chairman tan sri jeffrey cheah and axiata group president and ceo datuk seri jamaludin ibrahim bagged the outstanding ceo award. last years event was attended by deputy prime minister tan sri muhyiddin yassin.  this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on

bearish below the short- and long-term 30-day and 200-day moving averages. it remained below the ichimoku cloud indicator as well. the 30-day moving average fell below the 200-day moving average and the last time this happened was in october 2014 when the klci fell to as low as 1,674 points in december 2014. momentum indicators like the rsi and momentum oscillator started to increase last week, indicating that the bearish momentum has eased. the rsi indicator is at its oversold level and this may attract bargain hunters. the index has rebounded from the bottom bands of the bollinger bands indicator, but the bands are still expanding and this indicates that the momentum is still bearish. the technical indicators show that the klci is oversold in the short term and technically, a rebound is expected. the outlook for the klci remains gloomy and although a rebound is expected, the index may be capped at 1,760 points. failure to break above this level could send the index to the next support level at 1,675 points. while markets may be bearish, a weaker ringgit may pose opportunities for export-oriented companies such as furniture makers and technology manufacturers. benny lee is

celcom, foreign exchange (forex) losses and higher depreciation costs. we have just passed three months (of the financial year) officially. we want to see (results) for this quarter and the next quarter. it is premature to make a forecast for the rest of the year, said jamaludin. he also declined to indicate whether axiata (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.1) would achieve its initial key performance indicator targets of 4% growth in revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. jamaludin explained that celcoms earnings in 1qfy15 were dragged by teething issues from the companys it transformation programme last year which led to loss of confidence among distributors and customers in its systems. during the quarter, celcom, the countrys second largest mobile operator, lost 688,000 subscribers while its net profit declined by 18% year-on-year to rm378.1 million. to be frank, some dealers lost confidence in us. regaining that confidence cannot be done overnight. we have to prove that our system has not only recovered, but it is the best. we have dozens of initiatives to regain (confidence) and there are goods signs from them, said jamaludin. xl, which suffered rm215.4 million in losses in 1qfy15 due to forex losses and a shift in strategy from lower value customers to middle-end customers to boost average revenue per user , is also expected to do better in 2hfy15. for the record, (xl registered) a very strong black (profitability) if not for forex and its acquisition of pt axis tbk. after spending us$865 million (rm3.13

valuation: 1.7) as the main beneficiary of the move, as its prepaid segment contributes 73% to its revenue  the highest among mobile players. lee also noted that digis share price performance has been relatively weak in the past month, partly due to uncertainty about the gst implementation. amresearch analyst hafriz hezry said while the outcome of the move is mostly positive as telcos will be able to pass on gst to consumers, consumer usage is likely to be impacted. this model in itself can impact usage, on top of ultra-price sensitive prepaid users which might simply pare usage given the higher effective cost, he said, adding that he has conservatively only factored in a 3% pass through instead of a full 6% in his projections. hafriz noted that under the new pay-per-use gst system, the chargeable gst amount is taken out of prepaid credits, which essentially means that for a rm10 reload (and assuming full usage), consumers only get rm9.40 of actual credit. amresearch prefers axiata group bhd (fundamental: 0.85;

[but] at 3% to 4% yield, they are steady but not excellent. investors can get that with many other sectors, he added. in an april 2 note, alliancedbs research had conservatively assumed a 3% effective increase in prepaid revenue for the mobile players as it thinks that usage might be slightly impacted due to price inflation in the economy. this had previously led to an earnings upgrade of about 2% to 5% for the mobile players in financial year 2015 (fy15) and fy16, said alliancedbs research. maybank ib researchs analyst tan chi wei, who has an overweight call on malaysian telcos, in a note on

importantly, they both noted that the benefit had already been priced in or reflected in digis share price. digi has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 4.1%, according to theedgemarkets.com. in contrast, maxis bhds 12-month rolling is at 5.57%. meanwhile, cimb researchs analyst, foong choong chen, who has an underweight call on the sector, said in a note, also on april 2, that the risk-reward of telcos is unfavourable due to their current rich valuations and a potentially more intense competition this year. to recap, telcos increased their top-up voucher or reload coupon price by 6% after the gst kicked in on april 1, which caused quite an uproar among consumers, prompting thecustoms department to announce that it was investigating the telcos for the price increase, saying that prices should have been maintained. to add to the confusion, deputy finance minister datuk ahmad also weighed in on the issue the following day and said there should be no change to the prices of the reload coupons as the 6% gst would merely replace the sales and service tax (sst), which is also at 6%. but the communications and multimedia consumer forum later affirmed that top-ups for prepaid mobile services are subject to gst. telcos also clarified that they had previously absorbed the sst on prepaid mobile users. on friday, the malaysian communications and multimedia commission issued a press statement confirming that gst will be imposed on prepaid reloads. however, to ease the burden on consumers and as a transitional measure, it said four major telcos, namely celcom axiata bhd, digi, maxis (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 0.9) and umobile sdn bhd customers who reload rm5 and above will be given an additional value which is higher than the 6% gst in the form of free minutes and text messages for three months from april 3. a research analyst with a local bank said that the compromise is good news to telcos as the status quo of higher prices would likely stay at the end of three months. the solution is temporary and helps customers with the transition to higher costs. at the same time, mobile operators will still have the opportunity to pass on the cost of taxes to end users. plus, the additional 6% air time that they give to users may not may not be used by the customers. i think consumption patterns would be largely the same, he said. digi closed unchanged at

and the market was weighed down by the weak ringgit and falling crude oil prices. i was expecting the market to continue to be bullish last week but have also mentioned that the index needs to break above 1,830 points and that crude oil prices must rebound and the ringgit does not turn weak. the fbmklci declined 1.8% in a week to 1,789.73 points and was in line with global market performances. market volume was slightly higher from the previous week. average daily trading volume was 2.2 billion shares in the past week compared with 2.1 billion shares two weeks ago. after some accumulation two weeks ago, foreign institutions turned large sellers in the past week as the ringgit weakened. net selling from foreign institutions last monday to friday was rm593.5 million while net buying from local institutions and local retail was rm544.0 million and rm49.5 million respectively. for the fbmklci, only two out of the 30 counters went up and the increase was marginal. the two counters that went up were cimb group holdings bhd (+0.2% from last week) and axiata group bhd (+0.1%). the top three decliners in the index were sapurakencana petroleum bhd (-7.7%), genting bhd (-7.2%) and petronas chemicals group bhd (-5.5%). markets pulled back for a bullish trend correction last week. the shanghai stock exchange composite index rose 0.7% in a week to 3,287.10 points. hong kongs hang seng index fell 3.3% to 23,896.98 points. japans nikkei 225 declined 0.8% to 18,665.11 points, the highest level in nearly 15 years. singapores straits times declined 0.7% to 3,398.26 points. on monday, the us dow jones industrial average declined 1.6% in a week to 17,995.72 points after climbing to a record high a week ago. londons ftse100 index declined 0.8% to 6,879.12 points after pulling back from its record high last thursday. however, germanys dax index continued to climb to record highs, climbing 1.5% in a week to a record close at 11,582.11 points. the us dollar index rose to its highest level since september 2004, increasing from 95.34 points a week ago to 98.18 points. the ringgit weakened against the greenback at rm3.71 to a us dollar compared with 3.63 a week ago. the strong us dollar continued to pressure gold prices. comex gold fell 3.2% in a week to us$1,166.40 (rm4,304) an ounce. crude oil remained firm and the brent crude declined 1.7% to us$58.53 per barrel. crude palm oil futures on bursa malaysia fell 5.9% in a week to rm2,238 per tonne on weak demand. the fbmklci has turned bearish as it fell below its short-term 30-day moving average. market confidence was already weak as the index struggled to break above the long-term 200-day moving average last week and the decline below the short term average indicates sentiment has turned bearish. however, the index remained above the widening ichimoku could indicator and this indicates that there is support. furthermore, the fbmklci is still above the immediate support level at 1,780 points. a breakout below this level would confirm the bearish trend. momentum indicators like the rsi, momentum oscillator and macd are indicating that the price has turned bearish. the rsi and momentum oscillator fell below their mid-levels and the macd crossed below its moving average. furthermore, the bollinger bands are expanding and the fbmklci is trading below the bottom band for the past two days. this indicates that the bearish momentum is gaining strength. technically, the market is expected to remain bearish as the bearish momentum has built up in the past one week. furthermore, the ringgit is expected to weaken further while crude oil price remains bearish as falling gold prices indicate a possible stronger us dollar. henceforth, we expect further downward decline and the fbmklci is expected to test the immediate support level at 1,780 points. from the indicators, there is a high chance that this level will be broken and the next support level can only be found at 1,680 points. benny lee is chief market strategist for jupiter securities sdn bhd. jupiter securities is a participating broker in bursa malaysia. he can be contacted at [emailprotected]. the views

"article": " the recent slew of corporate earnings reports for the final quarter of 2014 was nothing to rave about and likely led to tepid overall growth for the full year. analysts are, however, more optimistic about the outlook for corporate earnings growth this year. most are projecting high-end single-digit growth for 2015, with the more confident forecasting double-digit growth.  this may lift investor confidence somewhat, considering that the latest financial reporting season may not have lived up to expectations. many had been keeping a close watch on the fourth-quarter results, which concluded last week, as a gauge of how companies would fare amid what was seen as a tougher economic and operating environment. interestingly though, official data showed that gross domestic product growth had actually improved to 5.8% in the final quarter of 2014, compared with 5.6% in the third quarter. prices of commodities declined last year, most notably crude oil prices. crude oil lost nearly half its value to us$60 to us$70 per barrel  at its lowest, it was just under us$60, in the fourth quarter  from a high of above us$100 in june. similarly, crude palm oil (cpo) prices also dropped to rm2,100 to rm2,200 per tonne due in part to extensive floods in the east coast. the plunge in crude oil prices had sent the benchmark fbm klci, which shed 5.66% last year, crashing to a low of 1,673.94 on dec 16 as oil and gas stocks took a beating. the index closed at 1,820.87 points last thursday. to aggravate matters further, the ringgit has weakened to around 3.50 to the us dollar as the greenback reflected broader strength against most emerging-market currencies on signs of an improving us economy. bimb securities head of research kenny yee expects corporate earnings this year to grow 8% to 9% after a likely contraction of 0.6% last year, while uob kay hian head of research vincent khoo anticipates 10% to 11% earnings growth this year after a probable expansion of between 2% and 3% last year. for 1q2015 and the rest of 2015, fluctuations in commodity prices, the us dollar/ringgit rate and, to a smaller extent, the temporary cut in electricity tariffs will have a bearing on earnings outlook. while we anticipate some earnings downside to our aggregate earnings growth of around 10% to 11% in 2015 (at the start of the year), we still expect better growth compared with 2014s depressed level, khoo tells the edge via email. yee, meanwhile, expects the equities market to perform better than last year. from the fbm klci perspective, core earnings of index-linked stocks are expected to grow 8.8%, says an analyst from maybank investment bank research. jf apex securities head of research lee chung cheng, however, expects a lower earnings growth of 5% to 6% this year. analysts say earnings growth this year will be largely underpinned by the banking, telecommunications (telecoms), export and utility sectors. the banking industry will be a key sector, given the reasonable analyst consensus forecast of bank earnings, says yee. he believes that since the sector has the highest weightage in the broad market and the fbm klci, it will drive earnings growth this year. nevertheless, the maybank ib analyst cautions that the banking sector may face pressure on margins due to intense competition and a weaker outlook. on the telecoms sector, he says it is a steady market, given the solid balance sheets of the players. their ability to come up with package deals should see earnings growth, especially from the data segment, provided margins remain intact. he adds that the ability to pass on the cost of the goods and services tax (gst) to the end consumer is a positive factor for telecoms players. the telecoms sector is a beneficiary of the gst. we expect it to report double-digit earnings growth. uob kay hians khoo says the ringgits weakness against the us dollar will continue to benefit exporters, particularly electrical and electronic (e&e), glove-making and flexible plastic packaging companies. he cites kossan rubber industries bhd (fundamental: 2.1; valuation: 0.3) and carlsberg brewery malaysia bhd (fundamental: 2.3; valuation: 2.1) as currency winners. etiqa insurance & takaful head of research chris eng believes e&e firms could be a positive surprise. these companies are beneficiaries of the strong greenback and higher demand for white goods (heavy consumer durables such as refrigerators and air conditioners), he tells the edge over the telephone. despite the electricity tariff reduction announced early last month, analysts continue to favour the utility sector, particularly tenaga nasional bhd (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.8). the government has announced a 5.8% or 2.25 sen per kwh electricity tariff reduction for peninsular malaysia. this will come into effect between march 1 and june 30. tariffs in sabah will also be reduced by 3.5% or 1.2 sen per kwh in the same period. eng says tenaga is likely to perform well despite the temporary rebate. he adds that it will be netted off against the reversals from the over-recovery of tenagas fuel costs. tenaga still has a strong core net profit. so, it is not an issue. over the long term, yee says tenaga will benefit from lower fuel costs and capacity expansion in excess of 1,000mw. revision in tariff is only a short-term knee-jerk reaction, as we believe in the longer run. on the whole, rhb research institute head of research alexander chia says companies with expanded capacity will be instrumental in bringing about earnings growth.\ncapital expenditure investment in new capacity is largely completed, therefore, new facilities are beginning to contribute new revenue, he says, citing examples of hartalega holdings bhd (fundamental: 2.6; valuation: 0.3), hovid bhd (fundamental: 2.1; valuation: 0.3) and cahya mata sarawak bhd (fundamental: 3.0; valuation: 1.5). sectors that may underperform this year include plantation and property. these two sectors could see some downside risks due to the lack of growth drivers, says chia. bimbs yee says the less efficient plantation companies are most likely to find it tough, given market pressure capping cpo prices. so long as cpo prices remain at current levels, maintaining margins is of utmost importance. he says developers offering properties in less alluring locations may suffer from selective demand, given that loans are more restrictive now. uob kay hians khoo notes that there could be pockets of mild downside risk this year for some companies due to situational triggers. umw holdings bhd (fundamental: 2.2; valuation: 1.2) could be a loser of a weaker ringgit due to us dollar-denominated costs in its automotive division, and axiata group bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 0.9) for poor underlying performance at its indonesian telecoms business and foreign exchange losses. genting malaysia bhd (fundamental: 2.4; valuation: 0.6) would incorporate one-off costs related to its failed new york casino bid. he notes that cimb group holdings bhd (fundamental: 1.35; valuation: 2.1) is also a potential loser amid a likely spike in credit costs, moderating loans growth, funding cost pressures and continued weakness in investment banking deal flows. the oil and gas sector, which has been snagging headlines since the second half of last year, will continue to be in the spotlight this year as the market will diligently track crude oil prices, chia opines. much depends on where oil prices are heading  if they make a reversal and go down again, the market will head downwards as a result, he says. lower crude oil prices will translate into lower revenue for oil and gas firms, and consequently see margins shrink.

indicators (kpis) for 2015, indicating that the industry is bracing itself for a tougher operating environment ahead. for the financial year ending dec 31, 2015 (fy15), tm (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 0.9) is now targeting growth in revenue and earnings before interest and tax (ebit) of between 4% and 4.5%, compared with an earlier forecast of 6% and 8% respectively set in february 2013. this growth will be largely supported by tms internet business as demand for the service continues to grow, said its group chief executive officer tan sri zamzamzairani mohd isa. for the medium term or by fy17, tm wants to achieve a 5% to 5.5% growth in both revenue and ebit. zamzamzairani said these targets do not take into consideration contribution from its 55.3% associate and wimax wireless provider, packet one networks (m) sdn bhd (p1), which tm acquired in march last year. the targets also exclude the implementation of both the high-speed broadband phase 2 (hsbb2) and sub-urban broadband projects which the government awarded to tm this week. what we are saying [with these kpis] here is that we would like to see our ebit growth match our revenue growth. we have to manage our cost to make sure our bottom line matches our top line, said he told a news conference to announce the groups fy14 results yesterday. a comparison with the headline kpis for fy14 also showed tm taking a more cautious stance on its forecasts for fy15. in fy14, tm aimed for a revenue growth of between 5% and 5.5%, which it achieved. it also aimed and reached its ebit growth of 5% last year. the more realistic targets, zamzamzairani said, is a reflection of the challenging fy15 and a result of balancing efforts to increase earnings while expanding tms business. there are many factors which affect our kpis. we are fixing the here and now business and, therefore, driving demand for unifi, increasing average revenue per user by upselling and reducing churn. thats the here and now. at the same time, we also have to invest our business for future growth. as we do that, our capital expenditure (capex) will increase. the challenge is in finding the balance u2026 and it is from that kind of analysis that we came up with our kpis, he said. as for capex for fy15, tm has set aside 20% of its anticipated revenue for enhancing its core network, access and support systems. tm is also cautious that competition among key market players would squeeze its profit margins this year but has said that it is well positioned to handle rivals. competition has always been there. if anything, it will start heating up. if you look at the way the industry is growing, users are all moving into data. you see voice declining and it is a global phenomenon. data and internet are increasing. but we are well positioned in terms of the broadband business. with p1 in the group, we have an additional element of mobility. this will enable us in the long run to provide converged services to our customers, said zamzamzairani. meanwhile, tm saw its net profit fall 17.8% to rm831.81 million in fy14 from rm1.01 billion in fy13 due to the absence of hsbb tax incentives. this came on the back of a 5.7% increase in revenue to rm11.24 billion from rm10.63 billion in fy13. earnings per share were lower at 22.89 sen compared with 28.29 sen. for the fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2014 (4qfy14), net profit also dropped 36.6% to rm218.27 million from rm344.24 million a year ago, due to tax reasons. revenue, however, was higher by 6% for the quarter under review at rm3.16 billion against rm2.98 billion in

for 2015", "article": "  kuala lumpur: axiata group bhd has revised downward its headline key performance indicators (kpis) for 2015, as the mobile telecommunication network provider expects the telecommunications industry to register slower growth in the low- to mid-single-digit percentages this year. the group is expecting a revenue growth of 4% for 2015 compared with 10.1% predicted last year; a return on invested capital growth of 8.7% compared with an earlier forecast of 9.3%; and a return on capital employed growth of 7.7%, down from an earlier estimate of 7.8%. however, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation for 2015 is forecast to grow faster at 4%, from an earlier estimate of 1.8%. the local industry is maturing faster than we thought, and the data revenue is not compensating enough for the reduction in voice and sms. last year, across the three telcos (celcom axiata bhd, maxis bhd and digi.com bhd) performance, there was actually a negative 2.5% growth in service revenue, axiata group president and chief executive officer datuk seri jamaludin ibrahim told a news conference to announce the groups full-year 2014 financial results yesterday. last year to some extent, we benefited from [acquiring] pt axis telekom indonesia, plus the growth of all the countries [which axiata has operations in] have slowed down a bit. so if you aggregate that, it would be harder for us to grow better than last year, he said. jamaludin said that this year, voice is expected to experience single-digit negative growth and sms to see a double-digit negative growth. however, data is expected to post a positive increase of between 30% and 50% year-on-year. on capital expenditure (capex), axiata has allocated rm4.8 billion for the current financial year ending dec 31, 2015 (fy15)  one of the highest amounts the group has set aside. for fy14, axiatas capex was rm4.1 billion. jamaludin said axiata (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 0.9) is being aggressive with its capex this year by allocating the full amount to data or data-related investments. this will predominantly be for the setting up of more base stations, fibre optics, and upgrading our core network in most countries, he said. meanwhile, axiata reported a 3% rise in fourth quarter fy14 (4qfy14) net profit to rm594.93 million from rm575.63 million a year ago, as it posted higher revenue from most of its global operating units. significantly higher foreign exchange (forex) gains and lower finance cost also supported its profit growth. revenue for 4qfy14 came in 6.7% higher at rm4.81 billion versus rm4.51 billion in 4qfy13. during 4qfy14, axiata registered forex gains of rm99.56 million compared with rm8.13 million in 4qfy13, while finance cost fell to rm256.95 million from rm310.23 million. axiata also declared an interim dividend of 14 sen a share, bringing full-year dividends to 22 sen. for the 12 months period ended dec 31, 2014, axiatas net profit declined 7.9% to rm2.35 billion from rm2.55 billion a year earlier, but revenue was 1.9% higher at rm18.71 billion versus rm18.37 billion. in fy15, the group will continue to face challenges and remain cautious in executing its business strategies. the key risks facing operating companies include political risks, intense competition, and foreign currency fluctuations and regulatory challenges, said axiata in a filing with bursa malaysia yesterday. on whether the group plans to increase its dividend payout ratio, jamaludin said the current payout of 84% seems to be the right balance between capex reinvestment and meeting the needs of the government as a government-linked company. it is, however, our policy to progressively increase the dividend payout, not necessarily the dividend, he said. meanwhile, on the malaysian communications and multimedia commission asking service providers to lower service charges, jamaludin said he was supportive of the measure as it would help the industry in the long run. axiata shares ended five sen or 0.7% higher at rm7.17 yesterday, bringing a market capitalisation of rm61.56 billion. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a

switch from yield to growth as qe3 ends?", "article": " there are a number of very attractive high-yield stocks that offer 5% to 7% returns in malaysia, mark mobius, emerging markets guru at franklin templeton investments, said at a recent media luncheon in kuala lumpur. the expert stock picker also said investors should look at stocks in malaysia individually to determine what the growth rates are going to be and work out how much more these stocks should be worth. at this stage, there are a number of stocks that you can buy, but i wouldnt rush in, he was reported to have said on oct 20. yet rather than recommending the safety in yields, mobius could really be looking for entry points to quality growth stocks. in his oct 28 blog post headlined focus on long-term fundamentals, not fears, he says now seems like a good time to examine the role of investor psychology in the market. i cant say when this current bout of market volatility will end, but i can say, based on decades of experience navigating the markets, it wont last forever. and it will likely bring potential opportunities for savvy investors who know where to look. incidentally, mobius blog post came just a day ahead of the us federal reserves oct 29 announcement of the end of its half-a-decade-long bond purchase programme  the latest of which is better known as the third instalment of quantitative easing (qe3)  meant to jumpstart economic growth. the next day, the us economy surprised the market by reporting its strongest back-to-back growth in over a decade. after growing 4.5% in 2q2014, the us economy grew 3.5% in 3q, beating median forecasts of 3%, according to bloomberg data. even before that, investors wanting to look past chinas bout of poor data releases in august found comfort in the governments effort to support its 7.5% gdp growth target for 2014, including pumping us$81.4 billion (rmb500 billion) cash into the countrys five state-owned banks in september. so, is it time to switch from yield to growth, or at least consider doing so? michael kurtz, chief asia equity strategist at nomura international (hong kong) ltd, whose team upgraded malaysia to overweight from neutral in an asean context on oct 8, thinks so. we are growing wary of yields relative performance prospects in the coming quarters u2026 historically, dividend yield stocks tend to underperform the broad market when treasury yields are rising. and the accepted view is that qe tended to suppress yields by substantially augmenting the bid for bonds. so less or no qe should, other factors being equal, free up yields to rise as the feds bid dries up, kurtz tells the edge. the time to own dividend yield stocks is when bond yields are falling or likely to remain at the bottom indefinitely, not when yields are moving higher, he adds, pointing out that rate strategists at nomura expect treasury yields to rise roughly 60 basis points from current levels by end-2015 as growth, wage inflation and higher short-term rates all get priced into the yield curve. we believe the point is near where demand growth in the us will begin registering more evident us wage inflation, which will have to get priced into long-end treasury yields. lim chee sing, executive chairman of rhb research institute in kuala lumpur, concurs. if nothing else, the end of qe3 means that investors will have to prepare for the next policy move by the fed and this is none other than the normalising of interest rates from an extremely low level, he says. in short, interest rates will rise, but when? for now, most economists expect the fed to hike rates by 3q or 4q2015, if not earlier. in a rising interest rate environment, high dividend-paying stocks that are trading at rich valuations may continue to lose their appeal as the spread between the dividend yield and interest rates [fixed-deposit or risk-free rate] will be narrowing, lim explains. thats why growth over yield is what is being recommended over a 12-month time frame by mixo das, nomuras asia ex-japan equity strategist in hong kong, for lower beta and lower correlation to carry trade returns. the most important deciding factor there is the direction of bond yields (and thus nominal growth expectations and fed policy expectations). earlier this month, the financial markets were pricing in sharp headwinds to growth, which we thought were overdone. economic data, on the whole, has been mixed, but this only means that the outlook for 2015 [which already expects accelerating global growth from 3.2% in 2014 to 3.6% in 2015] should remain unchanged, das tells the edge, pointing out that consensus expectations of the feds first rate hike happening had moved backwards to august from october 2015 after last wednesdays federal open market committee announcement. to be sure, das expects 2015 to see occasional periods of risk aversion, but the overall direction of bond yields should be higher. for malaysia specifically, das had, in a recent note, said risks to earnings outlook remain beyond the near term but there are stock-specific re-rating opportunities. capturing earnings growth at a reasonable price will be a key differentiator of performance, he writes in an oct 15 note. nomuras top picks on a 12-month time frame include malayan banking bhd, ijm corp bhd, gamuda bhd, mah sing group bhd, sunway bhd, axiata group bhd, telekom malaysia bhd and genting malaysia bhd. convinced that the us and global economies will continue to pick up in the months ahead, nomuras kurtz is even more bullish on growth stocks. dividend yield names could underperform even more if investors conclude in the months ahead that growth stocks look more interesting, leading to something of a mass exodus from yield. das adds, the other thing to remember is that yield as a style is a very crowded and expensive trade compared with its own past as well as relative to growth. put another way, the switch from yield to growth plays could also be spurred by the fact that yield stocks have already been chased high. more than 40% premium is currently being paid in global equity markets for the higher-yield quartile of stocks, kurtz says. deep-pocketed pension funds, including the employees provident fund (epf), favour companies with strong cash flow and dividend-paying capability to add to their pool of realised investment gains to pay annual dividends to members. epf a net seller for now, however, bloomberg data lists the epf as the top seller of three of malaysias four major telecoms stocks: digi.com bhd, telekom malaysia bhd and maxis bhd. telecoms stocks are known for their dividends and are favourites during periods of slow growth.  telekoms stock price, in particular, has appreciated over 26% year to date and dividends pushed total returns to 40% over one year. digis stock price is up by a fifth ytd and has delivered total returns of over 27%. the epf still owned 12.73% of digi as at oct 27, but had sold nearly 50 million shares or 0.64% in the past three months from 13.37% as at july 22, filings with bursa malaysia show. it sold about 43 million shares or 1.36% of telekom in the past three months and held a 13.14% stake as at oct 24 compared with 14.5% as at aug 5. filings also showed the retirement fund sold about 11 million maxis shares in recent months with its holding standing at 6.55% as at oct 27 compared with 6.7% as at july 7. based on the lowest analyst dividend forecasts on bloomberg of 23 sen and 21 sen respectively for maxis and telekom, there is a downside of 2.5% for maxis and 16.7% for telekom from their respective oct 30 close of rm6.74 and rm7.20 if one used 3.5% yield as a minimum expectation. for digi, the upside potential is 13.9% to rm6.86, using the lowest dividend forecast of 24 sen and assuming 3.5% yield. forecast dividend per share (dps) for maxis ranges from 23 sen to 32 sen and averages at 27.9 sen, which values the stock at rm6.98, assuming 4% yield. the dps forecast for telekom ranges from 21 sen to 31 sen and averages at 27.3 sen, which values the stock at rm6.83 if one assumed 4% yield. the minimum is above 19.1 sen based on its rm700 million minimum annual dividend promise. perhaps spurred by expectations of a business trust structure happening, the forecast for digis dividend is higher at 24 sen to 29 sen and averages at 26.2 sen, which values the stock at rm8.80 if one assumed 4% yield. among banking stocks  which mobius also recently reported to like, alongside generous dividend payers such as british american tobacco (m) bhd, guinness anchor bhd and carlsberg brewery (m) bhd  the epf pared about 22 million shares or 1.21% of hong leong bank bhd in the past four months. it still held 13.15% as at oct 27, down from 14.36% as at june 19. it is worth noting that the epf said due to its size, it usually chooses to take profit when there is enough buying interest in the market. to be sure, the higher borrowing costs that come with the end of ultra-low interest rates in the easy-money qe era, which drove asset prices higher and fuelled credit growth, are supposed to mean that the us economy is in better shape. as rhbs lim says, the end of qe3 implies that the fed is increasingly more confident of the us economic recovery and there isnt a need for investors to hide behind defensive and high-dividend stocks. still, he reminds investors that the inability of the major world economies to transition from a recovery to an economic boom since the 2008/09 global financial crisis suggests that lack of growth, specifically earnings growth on the part of corporates, is the key problem. this means that to outperform the market, one would need to identify growth stocks to make a difference. at the end of the day, it is earnings growth that will create new shareholder value and bring down valuations to a more attractive level, he remarks. in any case, current consensus shows there may well be some six to nine months before interest rates begin to rise. for investors who still want to have yield stocks in their portfolio, see page 10 for a selection of those with positive quarter earnings growth, single-digit pe multiples and at least 4% yield, according to bloomberg data. yields for 10-year mgs are between 3.82% and 4.12% at the time of writing.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on

about the economic development in europe. the strong us dollar was predominantly caused by the weakening euro, hammered by worsening economic numbers and the further easing of the monetary policy by

the macd has also fallen below its moving average or trigger line. furthermore, the klci has fallen below the bottom band of the bollinger bands indicator. therefore, the strong selling pressure may cause the market to continue to decline in the short term. the index failed to break above the immediate resistance level and broke below the support level instead. technically, the klci is continuing its short-term downtrend while remaining bullish in the short term. the long-term 200-day moving average is at 1,850 points and this is where the klci is expected to retest. a break below the support range between 1,840 and 1,850 points could turn the long-term trend into a bearish one with the next technical support can only be seen at 1,800 points.\n \nbenny lee is chief market strategist for

second time in three weeks as it buys out the national airline. khazanah nasional bhd. issued $500 million of seven-year sukuk today convertible into shares of state power company tenaga nasional bhd., said a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because the information is private. the notes can be swapped when the stock reaches a 15 percent premium over the reference price, the person said. khazanah is in the process of purchasing the 30.6 percent stake in malaysian airline system bhd. that it doesnt already own and will then delist the carrier from the stock exchange. the fund announced last week a 6 billion ringgit ($1.9 billion) plan to revive the airline. a prior attempt to sell the tenaga- linked sukuk was shelved on june 5 because pricing didnt meet expectations, said a person familiar with the deal at that time. theres little credit risk in this issue, james lau, who oversees $300 million as an investment director at pheim asset management asia sdn. in kuala lumpur, said in a telephone interview. the premium reflects the market view on the upside for tenaga shares. yields drop the dollar-denominated notes were priced to yield minus 0.05 percent and the reference price was set at 12.40 ringgit, the person said. the shares were at 12.24 ringgit as of 11:30 a.m. in kuala lumpur, up 7.6 percent this year. khazanah sold 1.5 billion ringgit of shariah-compliant bonds on aug. 19, according to two people familiar with that deal. both proceeds are for working capital, the term sheets show. raslan sharif, khazanahs spokesman in kuala lumpur, declined to comment on the latest bond offering by phone today. the yield on the funds existing exchangeable islamic bonds issued by a special purpose unit, pulai capital ltd., in 2012 fell to a 2 1/2-year low. the u.s. dollar notes due in march 2019 that can be swapped into shares of hong kong-listed parkson retail group ltd. yielded 0.007 percent, data compiled by bloomberg show. that compares with 0.06 percent on june 5 when the sale plan was scrapped. the average yield on global sukuk dropped 64 basis points in 2014 to 2.78 percent, the lowest level since may 29, according to a deutsche bank ag index, which predominately tracks u.s. currency corporate and sovereign notes. khazanah is the biggest shareholder in tenaga with 32.4 percent and also has holdings in the nations ihh

hopes of more special dividend payments in the near term. in addition, start-up losses from the 57% stake in p1 would eat into earnings as telekom moves into the space where three dominant mobile-phone operators are already finding it tough to grow, observers say.  telekoms group ceo tan sri zamzamzairani mohd isa contests this view. tm will never be no 4 in anything, says a bemused zamzamzairani on the notion of his company playing fourth fiddle to malaysias big three mobile operators: maxis bhd, digi.com bhd and its former unit celcom axiata bhd.  we want to be no 1 in terms of providing converged services  thats very different [from tm playing catch-up with the big three]. people look at us as another mobile player but we are not [adding mobility in isolation]. were a converged player focused on giving the best experience to our customers, he tells the edge.  telekoms decision to add wireless mobility to its traditionally fixed line-centric portfolio may not be that different from a mobile-phone operator like maxis offering its customers a wireline home phone and broadband to sell more services to existing customers. after all, consumers are increasingly accessing the internet using mobile phones and tablets, thanks to high-speed internet on-the-go.providing connectivity alone is not enoughu2026 looking at the changing behaviour of customers, if we only remain in that same space, we will get further and further away from the end-user. thats why we need to move towards enhancing the user experience with content, devices and apps  what we call the innovation exchange, zamzamzairani says, relating telekoms desire to offer an end-to-end suite of services to individuals as well as corporate and enterprise customers.  its about life made easier for our customers, business made easier for our corporate customers. thats not just our tagline but how we must approach the market [to win and retain customers]. technology is no longer a differential because anyone with money can buy technology, which is changing every day.  the lack of a differential in quality of service means that users are likely to choose a service provider that gives the best value and customer experience, industry experts say. this realisation has made it easier for telecoms operators to share network infrastructure  something unheard of in the mid-2000s when network coverage strength was still used as a selling point to woo mobile-phone customers.  similarly, telekom is recouping its rm8.9 billion investment in its hsbb network faster by selling wholesale capacity to rivals. old timers would remember the reluctance displayed by telekom, in its old incarnation, towards equal access, which would allow rivals to piggyback on the local loop to provide the old-school fixed-line phone service.  while the government made telekom promise to open the hsbb network to any local licensed provider when rm2.4 billion worth of public funds went into building phase 1 of the rm11.3 billion hsbb network, some experts think it is telekoms control over this trunk wired fibre network that gives it an edge over the local mobile giants.  it is easier for the fixed-line player to move into mobile, not the other way around, says a telecoms analyst, explaining how wireless network is relatively faster and cheaper to roll out.  zamzamzairani admits as much: because we are strong in [backhaul fixed line] infrastructure, we have greater control over the end-to-end experience. while telekom is open to more acquisitions to improve its service portfolio, he says the company is more likely to make opportunistic purchases rather than actively seeking out targets.  no 1 doesnt mean we have to own everything. we can fill gaps through collaborations like p1 or tie-ups with other players as well, he says, adding that enterprise services and business process outsourcing (bpo) are among areas telekom would like to further strengthen.  for now, the focus is to sort out details of the p1 collaboration, which gives telekom the right to name the latters ceo. with access to p1s 50mhz spectrum in the 2.3ghz and 2.6ghz bands for the 4g-long term evolution (lte) rollout, tm can make greater use of its spectrum in the lower 450mhz and 850mhz bands that have wider coverage capabilities versus the higher capacity to carry data in the higher bands.  what tm needs now is permission to use the 850mhz spectrum nationwide, beyond the universal service provision (usp) coverage [in rural areas], a telecoms analyst says, drawing comfort from the fact that the malaysian government has hitherto chosen not to charge high spectrum fees to encourage wider rollout.  zamzamzairani is convinced that telekom can make a strong case to ask for continued usage of the 850mhz spectrum for nationwide lte rollout when the spectrum is up for renewal next year. this would allow telekom to also offer mobile-phone services, on top of wireless broadband.  the other big-ticket item is the outcome of negotiations on the governments co-investment in phase 2 of the hsbb network rollout announced in budget 2014 last september. zamzamzairani says it is premature to give any guidance on capital expenditure as negotiations are still ongoing but is hopeful of concluding talks by year-end.  instead, he points out the strength of telekoms balance sheet to meet the potential rise in capex needs as well as keep its promise to pay a minimum annual dividend of rm700 million. peak funding was some rm2.7 billion in 2010, when capital needs for hsbb were at their peaku2026 were not a start-up. today our revenues are much strongeru2026 we have said there is no change in our dividend policy and we have many other levers [to pull], zamzamzairani says when pressed for details.  youre right that this [change in direction] is a chance to review [the dividend policy] but i can tell you that this is not being considered, he adds.  time will tell if the scenario will change should telekoms stake in p1 rise substantially.according to the terms of the planned rm210 million convertible bonds issuance by green packet bhd, telekom could end up taking over the latters entire 30% stake in the enlarged p1 if green packet defaults on the debt papers. this would raise tms stake from 57% to 87%, leaving south koreas leading lte operator sk telekom with a 13% stake. as it is, tm is taking up 60% or rm990 million of p1s planned rm1.65 billion convertible bonds to raise cash for network rollout over the next three to five years. for now, standard & poors credit analyst mehul sukkawala says telekoms credit rating is unaffected by its investment in p1 and the lte rollout, which is expected to raise debt-to-ebitda levels to about two times over the next two to three years from 1.7 times in 2013. even then, the ratio is likely to remain significantly below our downgrade rating trigger of close to 2.5 times, the analyst writes in an april 3 note. analysts polled on bloomberg seem split over tms stock performance for the coming 12 months, with eight buys versus 12 holds and 10 sells and price targets ranging from rm4.80 to rm7.22. using its current share base, yield was 3.36% at last thursdays rm5.83 close, based on its minimum rm700 million, or 19.57 sen per share, dividend payout. that could limit upside for the stock, although analysts agree that strategic assets are rarely ever cheap. asked on the naysayers, zamzamzairani said many doubted the hsbbs potential when the idea was mooted in 2008  the reason a minimum dividend was promised to reward investors who stuck on during the lower earnings and high expenditure days. today, hsbb take-up is greater than we thought. who would have thought that after only three-plus years, take-up rate would be 43%?  he, for one, has no doubt that telekom has all the important pieces of the puzzle to regain the dominance it once enjoyed. does this mean it is a matter of time before telekoms stock moves back to malaysias top three position  just like in the early 2000 when the so-called tmt (telekom-maybank-tenaga) stocks were the bluest of the malaysian blue chips?  were

in negative territory at the midday break on\nthursday, in line with the waning sentiment at most regional markets.  at\n12.30pm, the fbm klci fell 3.37 points to 1,810.73.  losers outnumbered gainers by 423 to\n193. that gave a market breadth of 0.45 indicating the bears were in control.\nvolume was 808.74 million shares valued at rm895 million.  the top losers\nincluded zhulian, hong leong capital, nestle, bat, lpi capital, hdbs, hup seng,\ngab, aeon and brahims.  xdl was the most\nactively trade counter with 40.32 million shares done. the stock slumped 10.5\nsen to 33. 5 sen.  the other\nactives included iris corp, knm, silk holdings, sumatec, cimb and ioi\nproperties.  the gainers\nincluded southern acids, kpj, ppb, warisan, hlfg, maica, oriental and sarawak\noil palms.  affin ib vice president\nand head of retail research dr nazri khan said that going forward, he expects the local\nmarket to brace for a weaker session riding on new year funds rebalancing\noutflow.  nazri\nsaid the fbm klci was likely to track the weekly weakness in wall street and\ntrend lower, retesting the support level of 1,800 on relatively heavier volume. he\nsaid that the global bourses were still struggling for clearer momentum after\nthe usa and chinese stock market slid on negative central bank announcement and\na batch of poorly-received usa corporate earnings. on\nthe technical front, fbmklci looks set to test the psychological 1800 support\non low volume as the last week drive below 1,820 level turned the trend in\nfavour of the bear in the near term. any decisive break below the 1,800 will\nmark a significant turning point causing a flush of more selling down to 1780,\nthe major support level the market perceives as the next buy-on-dips price\ntarget. further\nweakness on top five bursa largest stocks namely maybank, public bank, tenaga,\naxiata and cimb suggest more downside bias for fbm klci next week. immediate\nsupport stays at the psychological 1,800 followed by the rising 200-day moving\naverage at 1,780, said nazri.  elsewhere,\nasian markets fell on thursday after a survey of chinese manufacturers showed\nsurprisingly soft results, while the australian dollar weakened due to its role\nas a whipping boy when activity in the asian giant disappoints, according to\nreuters.  the\nflash markit/hsbc purchasing managers' index (pmi) for china fell to 49.6 in\njanuary, from december's 50.5, suggesting a mild slowdown at the end of 2013 has\ncontinued into the new year, it said.
