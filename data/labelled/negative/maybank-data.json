malaysia holdings bhd has lowered this years target to open its convenience stores to 100, from a previous forecast of 200, and its earnings are likely to be impacted as a result of the government introducing a new minimum wage scheme, according to an analyst with maybank investment bank bhd. on store openings however, we believe 7-eleven has turned more cautious, maybanks analyst liew wei han said in a note to clients today. having only opened 16 (net) stores in the first half of 2018 (1h18), it has since revised its targeted store openings to 100, from 200 in financial year ended dec 31, 2018 (fy18), liew added. according to cimb investment bank bhd, 7-elevens slower store expansion was on the back of its current emphasis on improving existing stores, in which it had managed to refurbish 99 stores in 1h18. 7-eleven also shared that it will now focus on refurbishing its stores for a more refreshed store front outlook and is on track to meet its goal of 150 refurbished stores a year, cimb analyst kristine wong and walter aw said in a note to clients today. at the same time, both maybank and cimb expressed their concern on 7-elevens earnings in fy19, which will see the bottomline by between 8.5% to 9.5% over the next two financial years. minimum wage will raise overheads, while the decision to maintain prices post sales tax implementation may dampen margins, maybank added. currently, maybank said between 80% to 90% of 7-elevens employees, which is equivalent to a staff force of between 13,000 and 14,000, are on the minimum wage scheme. meanwhile, cimb said the governments plan to roll-out a new minimum wage scheme of rm1,050 per month starting from jan 1, 2019, could potentially increase 7-elevens staff cost by between rm600,000 per month to rm700,000 per month, equivalent to an annual personnel cost of between rm7.2 million and rm8.4 million. assuming an average rm50 per month increase in minimum wage, personnel expenses could rise by about rm7 million per annum, maybank added, noting this is equivalent to 5% of 7-elevens earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in fy18. on wednesday (sept 5), the prime ministers office announced that the government had decided to raise the national monthly minimum wage rate to rm1,050 beginning next year, which is a rm50 more from the current rm1,000 in peninsular malaysia; and rm920 in sabah, sarawak and labuan. despite the government rolling-out the sales and services tax (sst) early this month, maybank said 7-eleven will leverage on its buyer power and intends to maintain prices at its convenience stores in the near term. with the implementation of the sst from sept 1, 2019, we understand that some suppliers have proposed to increase prices by an average of 5% to 6%, maybank said. however, 7-eleven has made an exception to the price of the cigarettes, which currently contributes 36% of sales in 1h18, maybank said, adding any cost increase will be passed on to consumers. going forward, cimb said 7-eleven will focus on increasing its product offerings, particularly in the ready-to-eat segment, which generates around 10% of its total annual revenue. moving forward, it intends to introduce rte [ready-to-eat] products in limited stores (5-10 outlets) by end-2018, to gauge consumer response, cimb added. given its large network of stores across the country, cimb said 7-eleven did not discount the possibility of setting up its own centralised kitchen, or working with a partner having existing facilities. as for the stock recommendation, maybank is retaining its sell call, while cimb is keeping to its reduce call on cautious earnings outlook. citing headwinds ahead, maybank said it has lowered 7-elevens fair value, with the 12-month target price reduced by 12 sen to rm1.12, from a previous forecast of rm1.24. at current price tag that is costing an arm and a leg, cimb said it is keeping 7-elevens fair value at rm1.05, a 25.2% downside to yesterdays closing price of rm1.40. we advise investors to stay away from the stock, pending effective execution of its long-term cost-saving initiatives, cimb added. at noon-break, 7-eleven shares paused at rm1.29, valuing the convenience store at a market capitalisation of rm1.59 billion."}, "1": {"date_posted": "18/1/2018", "title": "maybank 2017 mobile-banking transaction value tops rm24b",

the midst of planning a listing of a real estate investment trust (reit) on bursa malaysia, may float the trust as early as the first quarter next year. five malaysian assets valued at rm1.85 billion are expected to be injected into the mall-based reit, sources say. the edge understands that maybank investment bank bhd will be the adviser and sole bookrunner for the planned listing that will comprise klang parade and citta mall in selangor, 1 mont kiara in kuala lumpur, ipoh parade in perak and aeon bandaraya melaka. it is learnt that maybank investment and public investment bank bhd will underwrite the planned listing. aras country head june lim did not respond to questions sent by the edge. however, sources say an early exposure draft prospectus may have already been submitted to the securities commission malaysia and should ara stick to its plan, the reit is targeted for listing in 1q2018. it is understood that mtrustee bhd has been appointed as the trustee of the planned reit while knight frank malaysia is believed to have done the valuation of the malls. the assets are owned by a fund called ara harmony iii, which in effect is the sponsor of the reit. the assets were originally owned by ara asia dragon fund (adf), which is linked to hong kongs li ka-shings cheung kong group. ara harmony iii, established in august 2015, took over the portfolio of the income-producing retail properties in malaysia. at that time, the assets were valued at rm1.773 billion. in february 2015, the edge reported that an initial plan to divest the malls was scrapped as ara was planning to inject the assets into a private fund ahead of a planned listing. a source tells the edge that the total fund size is an estimated rm1.9 billion, of which rm1.85 billion are assets under management and the rest are listing-related expenses. up to 35% of the fund will be raised via debt while 65% or rm1.235 billion will be via equity. of this, it is understood that harmony iii will hold 50% while the remaining rm620 million may be raised from the planned ipo. it is learnt the net yield of the retail assets that will be injected into the reit is between 4.5% and 6.35%, with ipoh parade and aeon bandaraya melaka at the higher end of the range. sources say the malls are enjoying high occupancy rates. citta mall in ara damansara, which has 459,000 sq ft in net lettable area (nla), is about 85% tenanted while klang parade, which has an nla of 665,00 sq ft , is 94% tenanted. in kuala lumpur, 1 mont kiara, with 238,000 sq ft in nla, is 95% occupied. ipoh parade, with 618,000 sq ft, is believed to be the best performing mall among the five, with 97% tenancy. as for aeon bandaraya melaka, aeon is the master lessee, which for ara, is akin to being fully occupied. the nla for this mall is 623,000 sq ft. all the malls underwent renovation and refurbishment exercises in 2013/14, which means the tenancies may have been renewed recently. retail tenancy agreements are typically for three years. ara already manages amfirst reit in malaysia via its 30% stake in am ara reit managers sdn bhd, a joint venture with aminvestment group bhd. there is talk that ara may have to divest its 30% stake in am ara reit managers as it will be setting up its own reit and there may be a conflict of interest. at present, apm property management in malaysia is providing property management, consultancy and project management services for the assets. the five malls were acquired by adf1 between 2010 and 2012 for an estimated rm1.3 billion. adf1 was established in 2007 and had an initial term of seven years. the bulk of the asset enhancement exercise on the malls in 2013, which cost over rm200 million in total, was allocated for the upgrading of klang parade. adf bought 1 mont kiara from aseana properties ltd for rm330 million in 2010. aeon bandaraya melaka was acquired in the same year from aeon co (m) bhd for rm710 million, while it was still under construction. in 2011, adf bought klang parade and ipoh parade from tmw asia property fund. klang parade went through a rm120 million makeover, and rm90 million was spent on the upgrade of ipoh parade. as for citta mall, it was purchased in 2012 for rm200 million. the mall was developed by a joint venture between german real estate fund seb asset management and property developer puncakdana group. ara, which was listed on the singapore stock exchange, was taken private this year.

(we have) deferred principal repayment for two years until 2019 amid the current low market demand for offshore vessels. barakahs annual report reveals that the companys principal bankers are malayan banking bhd, export-import bank of malaysia bhd, affin bank bhd and ambank (m) bhd. the largest shareholders of barakah are nik hamdan, with 38.9% equity interest, sarawak-based samling group with a 13.6% stake and felda investment corp sdn bhd with an 8.91% stake. similarly, a spokesperson for dayang enterprise holdings bhd says banks are still supportive and lending, albeit only when supported by contracts in hand. we must add that local banks have had better appetite than foreign banks in the last few years ... foreign banks are putting on the brakes, tightening the bolts and nuts and this invariably is not helping the industry during this crucial time. for an asset-intensive industry, certain categories of assets, like vessels, would have their valuations greatly reduced and breaches of loan covenants would become common and it is in these areas that it is only fair that bankers give their indulgence, he says. dayangs largest shareholders are sarawak-based naim holdings bhd, with a 29.06% stake, the ling family (25.25%) and tengku yusof tengku ahmad shahruddin (7.52%). barakah and dayang do not have the epf or pnb as shareholders. not exactly strong parentage to warrant such treatment from the banks, a fund manager says.  petronas activity outlook even the petronas activity outlook 2018-2020, which was released earlier in the month and made public for the first time, has many functions. other than to keep the oil and gas players aware of the jobs being offered, it also highlights to the financial institutions the availability of jobs on the local front, helping to allay whatever fears they may have (see story on page 72). dialogs ngau, through an email, tells the edge, petronas is a seasoned and professional integrated oil and gas company that has lived through the cyclical variations of the industry in the past. this report demonstrates that it has a sound grasp of the current and medium-term environment and a robust plan to progress successfully in this uncertain climate. its continued investment and careful management of upstream and downstream segments provide direction and opportunity for malaysian companies and foreign investment. when asked what he thought of the activity outlook, ngau says, it has particularly highlighted the current investment at the pengerang integrated complex (pic) and the opportunity for continued development of pengerang into a regional downstream oil and gas hub, which will spur the growth of malaysias oil and gas downstream sector, propelling the country into a new frontier of technology and economic development. the pic is also expected to capitalise on the growing need for petrochemical products in asia for the next 20 years. barakahs nik hamdan says of the activity outlook, it is quite positive. several significant contracts are under bidding now, which shows its commitment to roll out more projects. barakah recently signed a consortium agreement with samling energy sdn bhd and brooke dockyard and engineering works corp to jointly bid for oil and gas-related projects in sarawak. samling energy and brooke dockyard are sarawak-based companies while samling group has a 13.5% stake in barakah. from deleums perspective, the petronas activity outlook outlines the activities. its quite straightforward but these are proposed activity plans; we have to see them rolled out and implemented, says nan yusri. what is not clear are the factors that govern it. if the price of oil changes, petronas will reassess the situation. we have to monitor the factors that govern the plan, he says in a brief conversation with the edge.  deleum has been in the news lately in october, deleum, via its 60% unit deleum primera sdn bhd, was awarded a maintenance, construction and modification contract for gas structures in peninsular malaysia by petronas carigali sdn bhd. this could be worth anywhere between rm750 million and rm1 billion. nevertheless, the margins for these jobs seem tight, largely because of competition. petronas has some 3,900 companies registered as its contractors. norway, which has a similarly sized oil and gas industry, has a mere 700 companies. this has resulted in a call for consolidation within the industry. uzmas kamarul says, it means that people have to work better and people have to have better capabilities. like it or not, what will happen is the natural attrition of those who are not capable. petronas is ensuring this happens by bringing the bigger contracts; people will say smaller companies are being sidelined, but you need this kind of thing u2026 this is the right time to do it. thus far, the only recent attempt at consolidation was a plan to merge permodalan nasional bhd-controlled umw oil & gas corp bhd with ekuity nasional bhds icon offshore bhd and orkim sdn bhd, but the deal fell through. other than the above, the only sizeable merger was when dayang made a general offer for perdana petroleum bhd in 2015  just after oil prices crashed. the dayang spokesperson reminisces on the trials and tribulations after the huge rm1.16 billion takeover offer for perdana. we quickly reverted to consolidation mode and essentially looked at ways of curtailing costs to sustain the onslaught of rate cuts and discounts. it is a survival of the fittest game as well as a time to demonstrate who can sustain longer and better. for us, we truly adhere to the fact that when the going gets tough, the tough get going. it is true grit and determination that has got us through this far, coupled with the fact that our clients and shareholders were understanding and supportive of our measures. we believe we may have seen the worst and the worst is over! he says.

launch a new electronic money service platform in the middle of next month, followed by an e-money scheme in the first half of next year, according to sources. its going to be malaysias first homegrown social marketing platform and e-wallet, bringing a new way to save on shopping and help sellers get more shoppers to boost their brands and sales, a source tells the edge. it is learnt that puc will introduce the unconventional services to the market in phases next year. all details and the targeted timeline for each phase will be revealed at the mid-december launch. another source highlights that e-wallet is a lucrative area of growth in the modern economy and, hence, pucs scheme will promote customer-to-customer (c2c) payments to shoppers. moving forward, puc may even promote more financial services to shoppers. it will enable c2c payments based on convenience-centric lifestyle activities such as seamless dining bill-splitting, he says. puc is also exploring services that will bridge the gap between shoppers and convenient financial services. however, all these are subject to obtaining the necessary licences from the authorities. puc, formerly known as puc founder (msc) bhd, is an ace market-listed information technology solutions provider that is also involved in renewable energy, media and advertising as well as e-payment processing services. to recap, in early september, puc obtained conditional approval as an e-money issuer from bank negara malaysia. the group also has two subsidiaries with moneylending licences. in a filing with bursa malaysia on sept 7, puc announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, epp solution sdn bhd, had been given approval to issue e-money within a year. epp solution  also a registered business with bank negara for merchant acquiring services  will be joining a list of at least 25 non-bank entities that have been given approval to issue e-money via their mobile apps. other players include aeon credit service (m) bhd, alipay malaysia sdn bhd, axiata digital ecode sdn bhd, managepay services sdn bhd, paypal pte ltd, touch n go sdn bhd and xox com sdn bhd. five banks, namely ambank (m) bhd, bank of china (m) bhd, cimb bank bhd, malayan banking bhd and rhb bank bhd, have also received the green light from the central bank to become e-money issuers. for perspective, there are two types of e-money schemes  the small scheme and the large scheme  which are determined by the purse size and the outstanding e-money liabilities. puc said in the sept 7 announcement that it has obtained approval from bank negara to issue e-money under the large scheme, which refers to a maximum purse limit of rm1,500. in comparison, the small scheme only allows a maximum purse limit of rm200. it is worth noting that puc recently embarked on a few exclusive collaborations with some start-ups, paving the way for the company to build its e-wallet business. last month, puc announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, founder qube sdn bhd (fq), has signed a memorandum of understanding with hong kong-based advwhere ltd for a collaboration, where fq will be appointed with the exclusive right to sell cloudbreakr digital advertisement placement solutions across malaysia, indonesia and singapore. puc is also teaming up with point-of-sale services provider bersian technology (m) sdn bhd to implement a cross-marketing collaboration. in june, puc signed an exclusive partnership agreement with laputa ventures sdn bhd to use the latters advertising platform, dubbed moola, to offer on-vehicle advertising.  variation to utilisation of proceeds while puc has obtained approval as an e-money issuer and identified its partners, it needs the funds to launch the service. it has said rm36.45 million had been allocated for the rolling out of the e-money scheme. interestingly, the money will be coming from the rm42.65 million raised from a rights issue of irredeemable convertible unsecured loan stocks (iculs) in february last year. puc is in the process of obtaining clearance from the relevant regulators to vary the utilisation of the proceeds. puc has submitted its request to securities commission malaysia. barring any unforeseen circumstances, the company should be able to call an extraordinary general meeting as early as december to get shareholders approval, says a source familiar with the company. to recap, the edge in april reported that puc had net cash of rm43.3 million, rm42.65 million of which it cannot use for any purpose other than to expand its renewable energy business. in october 2015, puc proposed the issuance of iculs with warrants to raise up to rm83.9 million, but only managed to get rm42.65 million to fund its solar expansion programme. in february last year, jack cheong chia chieh, the chief of puc, died of a sudden illness at the age of 44. market observers have pointed out that his brother and successor, cheong chia chou, who was appointed the new managing director last december, is not keen on the renewable energy business that was started by the late chia chieh. instead, he is more interested in developing the companys it business. under the feed-in-tariff programme, puc currently operates a 1mw capacity solar photovoltaic power plant in sungai petani, kedah. the output will be supplied to tenaga nasional bhd at a fixed rate. to date, however, puc has yet to be awarded any new project despite efforts to apply for quota with the sustainable energy development authority of malaysia and energy commission. year to date, shares of puc have risen 223%. the stock closed at 21 sen last thursday, giving the company a market capitalisation of rm284 million. "}, "6": {"date_posted": "4/12/2017", "title": "lotte chemical titan seen as long-term value buy  analysts", "article": " kuala lumpur: investing in lotte chemical titan holding bhd (lct) has been tough this year. not only has weak investor appetite dealt a blow to its initial public offering (ipo), but a 13-day water supply cut in april eroded its second-quarter earnings and caused its share price to sink lower. news of a fire that broke out at its plant in johor didnt help investor sentiment. shares of lct have been on a downtrend since its listing in july at rm6.50. it fell to a low of rm4.28 in august but has since recovered. however, the share price has continued to be on a downtrend after it hit rm5.80 in september. it closed at rm4.75 last thursday, which is at a three-month low. lcts share price has been trading in the range of rm4.14 to rm6.53 since its listing. despite the stocks volatility, analysts see the weakness as a buying opportunity for long-term investors. according to areca capital sdn bhd chief executive officer danny wong, the recent foreign selling has created a value buy in lct, which is trading below its net tangible asset (nta) of about rm5. its a value buy for long-term investors who are keen to buy and hold for about five years. the stock is currently trading below its book value and when viewed from a price-earnings ratio (per), it is also very attractive compared with its peers. the current dividend yield is also decent for long-term investors, especially if the earnings of lct were to normalise, wong said. the management has guided that the dividend payout ratio for the financial year ending dec 31, 2017 (fy17) to be about 50%. for the cumulative nine months ended sept 30, 2017 (9mfy17), the group recorded a net profit of rm686.08 million or 36.29 sen per share. even without taking into consideration its fourth quarters results, the dividend per share would have been about 18.1 sen per share or about 3.8% yield based on its current price of rm4.75. recall that lcts management has guided that its malaysian plants should achieve a strong utilisation of 90% in 4qfy17 in view of no major planned shutdown and the expected commissioning of its new te3 plant in the fourth quarter. the management also expects demand for polyolefin products to be stable, with the latin american market continuing to look out for supply outside of the us until supply from the us is stable post-hurricane impact. nonetheless, wong cautioned that the increase in cost per unit of production during 3qfy17 may be a concern among some investors, especially if the trend continues. still, he believes that this is a buying opportunity for long-term investors. ta securities holdings bhd analyst kylie chan concurred, deeming lct attractive. she predicts lct to report a net profit of rm819.6 million in fy17, with its core earnings per share coming in at 42.8 sen. under such an assumption, the groups dividend payout would have been about 23 sen per share, and translated into about 4.8% dividend yield. chan is also optimistic about the groups outlook despite the latest selldown that saw its share price fall below the rm4.80 level last week. we think that the groups earnings will be rather resilient with crude oil price remaining at a subdued level currently compared with the us$100 (rm409) per barrel level. with operations now normalised and the disruption of the water supply issues behind us, the results for the coming quarter should be rather decent, she said. she added that lcts multi-year earnings growth story remains intact, with significant new capacity coming on stream in the coming years as well as the supports to the groups robust margin from the subdued oil prices in the near- to medium-term. last thursday, brent crude was hovering at us$64 a barrel ahead of the opec meeting in vienna. chan has set a target price of rm6.66 for lct, indicating a potential return of 40% to its current price of rm4.75. other analysts covering lct are also positive of its outlook, with all of the eight research houses recommending a buy call on the stock and an average 12-month tp of rm7.20. based on its closing price of rm4.75 lsat thursday, this implies an upside of 52%. rakuten trade sdn bhd vice-president vincent lau is also of the view that lcts value is emerging amid the current price weakness. he, however, thinks that it is worth a look should the share price drop further to rm4.50 level. the lacklustre performance of the groups share price was seen from its debut on bursa malaysia after a relaunch of its ipo at a lower price of rm6.50 compared with its initial rm8 as well as the reduction of its offerings by a fifth, following an overestimation of demand for its shares by bankers. the group had to buy back shares amounting to rm226.25 million, rendering it non-compliant with the public shareholding requirement, that at least 25% of the stocks must be in the hands of public shareholders. it didnt take long for another negative surprise to hit lct, when a 71.9% plunge in its net profit to rm113.6 million due to a water supply interruption in april. while the group included the incident in its prospectus documents, there was no disclosure of any financial impact from the event. it was indeed a series of unfortunate events for lct as there was a fire incident on the te3 project in september. in october, there was a stop-work order issued by the environment department on its kbr catalytic olefins technology catalytic cracking reactor within its te3 project,

stake in aspion sdn bhd from adventa capital pte ltd for up to rm1.4 billion last friday, cimb research's back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that its financial year ending aug 31, 2018 (fy18) to fy20 earnings per share (eps) will increase by 3.9% to 13.6%. cimb research noted that the figures were arrived at after accounting for higher interest costs and a larger share base (10% purchase consideration to be satisfied by cash). \"we also note that top glove will turn from a net cash company to one with a net gearing ratio of 0.5 times to 0.6 times, which remains healthy, in our view, given the size of the acquisition,\" said cimb research in a note. aspion is estimated to be the second-largest surgical glove maker globally in terms of volume, said cimb research. currently, it has three production facilities (kulim, kota bharu and kluang) with a capacity of 5 billion per annum, and the company is in the midst of expanding capacity by 24.4%, mainly in the surgical glove segment, which should be completed by end-2019, said the research house. \"as aspion specialises in surgical gloves, top glove will have access to a wider range of surgical glove products while gaining technological know-how that will allow it to produce higher margins and better quality surgical gloves,\" said cimb research. this acquisition will also include 50 patents and trademarks, including latest r&d products, and will enable top glove to tap into aspion's key developed markets, such as japan, europe and north america; the bulk of top glove's surgical glove sales are to emerging markets, said cimb research. if reflected, the potential upside to cimb research's target price is 11.2% to 12.2%, bringing its would-be target price to rm7.67 to rm7.74, the research house said. hence, cimb research maintains its add call on the stock but keeps the target price unchanged at rm6.90, still based on 19 times cy19 p/e. meanwhile, maybank ib research in a note said top glove will be taking up a us dollar loan with interest cost of 2.5% to 3%. \"based on a debt [to] equity ratio of 90:10, we estimate that this proposed acquisition will raise top glove's eps by 9% to 10%,\" said maybank ib, adding that the acquisition is estimated to lift top glove's surgical glove segment's gross margin by 5 percentage point (ppt) to 10ppt and group's overall margin by 0.4ppt to 0.8ppt. upon acquisition, top glove will be the world's largest surgical glove supplier with a market share of circa 29% (circa 12% now), said maybank ib. maybank ib is maintaining its eps forecasts, hold call and target price of rm6.20 for now (20 times 2018 p/e ratio, +1sd to mean). top glove presently trades at 22 times 2018 p/e ratio. at 2.20pm, shares in top glove were up three sen or 0.44% to rm6.88 with

what the banks are telling us on their cautious stance on lending to the commercial property sector due to softness/oversupply seen in this segment and also selectively the notion of cautiousness

the 1,740 level as some market participants chose to sell selective blue chip stocks in the last few minutes before the closing bell. this violation of 1,740 is expected to dampen the market sentiment because aggressive market participants would likely be taking the chance to sell given this imbalance demand and supply relationship. thus, an inability on the part of the benchmark index to climb

pushes crude oil higher, but can it stay up?", "article": " it has been a long and deep trough for the oil and gas industry, but could the end finally be in sight as crude oil prices move higher? last week, brent crude shot up to us$59.02 a barrel  the highest in nearly 27 months. and already, reports have begun to herald the end of low oil prices. some, like citigroup incs head of global commodities research, ed morse, have even begun to warn of a potential supply gap next year. morse warns that countries like libya, nigeria, venezuela, iran and iraq may already be pumping near-maximum capacity and that weak investment in exploration and development could hinder production increases in the near future. this could compound the growing volatility of oil prices due to increased uncertainty in the middle east. since the 72nd session of the un general assembly last week, the possibility of sanctions against iran by the us has re-emerged, threatening to throttle the supply of about two million barrels per day. another 650,000 barrels per day of qatari oil could also be affected if tensions between the small gulf state and its arab neighbours escalate. on top of that, there is also the unlikely possibility of a civil war breaking out in iraqs northern kurdish region, which produces roughly 600,000 barrels per day, or nearly 12% of iraqs total production. the iraqi government has already threatened military action against the kurds, who held a referendum for independence last week, a vote that was not recognised by iraq. topping off the geopolitical risks are rising tensions between pyongyang and washington as the leaders of both nuclear-armed nations traded pointed barbs. coupled with a temporary suspension of production in houston, texas, due to hurricane harvey last month, and the ongoing production cut by opec, crude oil posted its fifth consecutive weekly gain. this raises questions about the direction of oil prices. after hovering between us$40 and us$50 for the past two years, is it time for crude oil to break out above the us$60 level? if so, how high can it go, and will it mark the end of low crude oil prices? what does it mean for the oil and gas industry? looking at exploration and production (e&p) stocks like hibiscus petroleum bhd, the market at least appears to be pricing in a brighter future for such companies. hibiscus petroleum surged as much as 46% last week before settling marginally lower at 64.5 sen on thursday. the company generates the bulk of its income from the anasuria cluster in the uk, its first producing field. in stark contrast was the 12.9% fall in sapura energy bhds share price to rm1.49 last week on a disappointing set of results. while sapura energy has some exposure to e&p, most of its earnings come from leasing drilling rigs. the groups second-quarter core profit came in at rm36.9 million, bringing the first half earnings to a mere rm42.9 million  substantially lower than the full-year market expectation of rm226 million. only six of the groups rigs were in use, down from seven last year. another 10 stacked rigs remain unutilised. as the tender rig t-12 will be dropping out of chevrons contract next quarter, the groups rig utilisation will drop further to 33%, writes aminvestment bank in a report last week. the takeaway is that companies that own and lease assets for e&p activity are still feeling the pinch from years of low oil prices. until the oversupply of oil resolves itself and the oil majors start splashing out on capital expenditure again, it is going to be slow going for companies like sapura energy, says lee cherng wee, an analyst with jf apex securities. even if oil prices rise in the short term, sapura energy is not going to benefit immediately. oil prices would need to rise and stay up to support sapura energy, explains lee. sapura energy does benefit slightly from its e&p division but the units overall contribution is still small. however, this will improve once the unit hits first gas in the b15 field, most likely in november. lee is not optimistic about sapura energys outlook and has a hold call on the stock with a target price of rm1.48. in contrast, liaw thong jung, maybank ib researchs associate director and regional head for oil and gas services, has a buy call on the company with a target price of rm2. if oil prices go up, the immediate beneficiaries would be companies in the e&p space. of companies under our coverage, sapura energy is a good beneficiary  it is a hybrid involved in upstream as well as services, he explains. however, he cautions that a longer-term view is needed to see value in sapura energy. service providers normally see a lag effect of about a year between an increase in oil prices and an improvement in their bottom line from new jobs. we are at the bottom of the trough and this is a cyclical industry. sapura energy has shown sustained order book replenishment and its tender pipeline is improving. on top of that, the monetisation of the groups gas assets  sk408 (gorek and larak) field  is expected to be a catalyst. that said, liaws top picks in the sector remain the safe bets  companies like dialog group bhd and yinson holdings bhd. both boast relatively stable and predictable income streams and strong balance sheets that have weathered the oil and gas downturn. however, such stocks are also less sensitive to the upside potential of a rebound in oil and gas prices. even after a recent rally, hibiscus petroleum is valued at an estimated 4.89 times forward earnings. it is not well covered by analysts but two reports on the stock have put its target price at between 85 sen and rm1.06. the surge in trading activity in the stock more likely points to something bigger than merely keeping up with the rise in crude oil prices, say observers. perhaps, it has to do with the anticipated conclusion of a 50% acquisition of participating interest in four existing oilfields off sabahs shores from shell sabah selatan sdn bhd for us$25 million. this deal was announced almost a year ago. however, crude oil prices still face headwinds. the global economy is still growing slowly, so demand for oil is flat for the foreseeable future, comments lee.

over 29% since then. this may have prompted some disposals by institutional shareholders to realise gains. between aug 7 and 11, amanahraya trustees bhd disclosed that it sold a net amount of 51.52 million shares on behalf of amanah saham bumiputera. the price was not disclosed, but open market prices suggest the block would have fetched about rm498 million. the employees provident fund (epf)

will there be a merger with another banking group? recall that some four months after ammbs azman, 78, announced his impending departure in january, the group entered into merger talks with rival rhb bank bhd. azman has a 12.97% interest in ammb and, like teh, has no family member who is keen on taking over the business. i really wouldnt speculate to that extent. of course, one cant entirely discount the possibility of a merger, but you must remember, it wont be cheap for any bank looking at public bank. its trading at 2.3 times price to book ... a lot of the mergers these days are done by an exchange of shares. of the two banks that are larger than public bank, cimb group holdings bhd is trading at 1.5 times price to book, while malayan banking bhds (maybank) is at 1.3 times ... so it would be difficult. i dont see a merger happening in the next 12 months, a banking analyst tells the edge. teh has a total equity interest of 23.54% (908.9 million shares) in public bank, held directly and through consolidated teh holdings sdn bhd. the stake was valued at rm18.9 billion based on last fridays market close of rm20.76 per share. public bank, long admired by its rivals, is the benchmark setter in the industry on important metrics like asset quality, return on equity and cost management  a testament to tehs prudent and conservative management from way back. it has top market shares in retail banking, and has a solid small and medium enterprise client base. the whole point about public bank is that its a nice bank to have and im sure other banks covet it, but its so expensive, another analyst says. public bank itself has given no indication that it plans to deviate from its longtime strategy of organic growth. of the merger scenarios that have been bandied about by analysts in the past, public bank is seen to fit better with cimb than maybank. maybank would of course be able to digest a bank the size of public bank, that wouldnt be an issue. but, the concern is more about customer attrition. public bank has a strong chinese customer base that may switch to hong leong bank. there would be no point in maybank paying a premium for public bank if it runs the risk of customer attrition. the bank is seen as a better fit with cimb because cimb is weak on the sme side ... it is building from a very low base versus maybank, which has a bigger sme profile, the first analyst says. analysts doubt teh will sell his shares anytime soon. i think the one difference between him and the the other prominent banker, hong leongs quek, is that the latter has so many other businesses. if the price was right, he would sell the bank and move on. but teh is a thoroughbred banker. apart from lonpac [insurance bhd], which is also finance-related, banking is his main focus. its his baby and it keeps him going, so hell probably hang on to it, one analyst says. teh will also retire as chairman in public islamic bank bhd and public investment bank bhd, on jan 1 next year, but will stay on as non-executive director.

"17/7/2017", "title": "downward revision in lotte chemical titans ipo underlines delicate market conditions ", "article": " even after the revision in the price and size of lotte chemical titan holding bhds (lct) initial public offering, it is still the largest ipo on bursa malaysia in five years. but the downward revision has triggered discussions on whether the issuer and its advisers had been overly optimistic in their valuations or whether it was a matter of poor timing. the initial target of the ipo was to raise up to rm5.9 billion. that is large, and it was obvious from the start that foreign investor participation was needed, according to an investment banker familiar with the deal. from the roadshows and book-building exercise, there was enough demand from foreign institutional investors but most were multi-strategy or hedge funds. to ensure a good after-market performance, and to ensure the stock continues to perform post-listing, additional long-term investors were needed, he says. the commitment from cornerstone investors such as permodalan nasional bhd and eastspring investments bhd gave lct the confidence to set the offer price at rm8 per share. other committed backers included great eastern life assurance (m) bhd, maybank asset management sdn bhd and maybank islamic asset management sdn bhd. however, last monday, lct announced that it was reducing its ipo size by 21.7% from 740.483 million shares to 580 million shares. it revised the offer price to rm6.50 per share a day later, putting the amount raised at some rm3.77 billion. last tuesday, malaysian issuing house sdn bhd (mih) disclosed that lcts retail offering of 55.78 million shares saw a take-up rate of 61.87% or 34.51 million shares. the unsubscribed retail offering of 21.27 million shares, which were underwritten by the joint underwriters, were reallocated to the institutional offering. mih said the institutional offering of 524.22 million shares were fully taken up. yes, the deal did encounter some speed bumps but the point is, it got done and the issuer raised almost rm4 billion. that is not an easy feat, the investment banker says. the deal size was reduced probably to ensure a successful transaction, which turned out to be the right decision by the company. on hindsight, yes, the institutional investors could have taken up everything but it would have been risky and the deal may not close, he explains, adding that the petrochemical business may not be well understood by international investors that have other investment options in the region. as for timing, the ipo market is just beginning to see a revival of sorts with 10 companies  including lct  going for listing, raising up to rm7.14 billion. last year, some rm825.27 million was raised from ipos on bursa malaysia  barely 18.97% of the sum raised in 2015. according to bursa, the ipo market raised rm4.35 billion in 2015 and rm3.94 billion in 2014. there were 12 ipos in 2016 and 13 in 2015. while certain quarters in the capital market say the downsizing of lcts ipo was because the issuer and advisers had been overly ambitious  with some even saying the ipo adviser had misread the market  kaf investment funds bhd chief investment officer gan kong yik has a different perspective. it was not really a misjudgement. they were pretty bullish on the market when they priced it at rm8 per share, but we have to give it to the management for being open-minded enough to revise the deal to suit the market appetite, he says. maybank investment bank bhd was the ipos principal adviser, joint global coordinator, joint book runner, and managing and joint underwriter. credit suisse and j p morgan acted as joint global coordinators and joint book runners. nomura and hsbc were the joint book runners while cimb investment bank bhd was a joint book runner and underwriter. affin hwang investment bank bhd and midf amanah investment bank bhd were the joint underwriters. in fact, it is very professional to do it this way. the management can choose not to do anything. and sometimes, it is very hard to gauge what is the best price u2026 especially in the retail segment. retail investors dont look at valuation so much  they look more at the absolute value, gan explains. a broker, who prefers anonymity, agrees with gan and says his retail clients were reluctant to subscribe for lct shares mainly because of the high absolute price. with rm6.50, they have many other choices. rm8 [per share] cannot sell in this market, regardless of the pe (price-earnings ratio). investors generally still look at the absolute price, he says. also, raising capital in this market is not easy because the risk is still high in malaysia, especially with the 14th general election around the corner, he adds. while there are mixed views on the revision, a fund manager, who declines to be named, says the revised offer price of rm6.50 per share has made the ipo more appealing and foresees a potential 10% upside upon listing. although this is a long-term counter, to get 10% return at rm8 per share is a bit difficult but rm6.50 would be easier. lets see what happens on tuesday, he says.

price has been steady so far this year. gentings share price has gained about 20% since the start of the year  this is considerably good for a stock with a market capitalisation of rm36 billion. it closed at rm9.55 last friday compared with the recent trough at rm7.45 in mid-november last year. still, analysts reckon that genting's share price could go higher. more than half of analysts surveyed by bloomberg have buy recommendation on the investment holding company that holds a majority stake in two public-listed casino operators, namely genting malaysia bhd (gem) and genting singapore plc (ges). most of them have pegged target price at above rm11. in fact, gems share price has fared better than its parent. it climbed to a new record high of rm6.13 in june. year to date, it has increased 27%. it closed at rm5.74 last friday. across the causeway, ges is out of share price doldrum gaining 19.3% at s$1.08 (rm3.38) so far this year, although it is still far from its record high of s$2.17. genting owns 49.32% of gem, and a 52.84% stake in ges. in a research note dated july 14, alliancedbs analyst cheah king yoong said being the parent company of gem and ges, genting offers a cheaper exposure to the two casino operators. as the parent company of ges and gem, which contribute the bulk of the groups earnings, gentings share price is highly dependent on the earnings prospects of these two key subsidiaries, he said, noting that gentings share price performance is highly correlated to share price movements of ges and gem (correlation coefficient of 0.7) as these two subsidiaries contribute about 80% of gentings earnings. as such, cheah foresees more buying impetus for genting in the coming quarters. he opines that the progressive launches of key developments in genting integrated tourism plan (gitp) and earnings recovery in ges are strong rerating catalysts for genting. maybank investment bank research analyst samuel yin shao yang concurred that genting was a cheaper proxy to its two listed units. genting is more than a proxy, especially with regard to gem, as genting is also directly exposed to gitp via licensing and management fees that it charges gem. we forecast these fees to burgeon to rm1.1 billion and account for approximately 25% of genting earnings in 2019, he said in a note dated july 11. yin said genting does not charge ges licensing and management fees, however, the research house expects gentings share price to surge if the latter wins a japanese integrated resort licence. on ges earnings prospect, alliancedbss cheah said the sluggish share price performance back in 2015 and early 2016 was partially due to concerns over rising bad debts. the stronger earnings recovery by ges is underpinned by cost reduction initiatives and more conservative credit policy, he explained. cheah said 2017 will mark a recovery in earnings following two tough years due to normalising vip win rate and ges has been more selective and conservative in credit policy over the past year. on gitp update, cheah said gem soft-launched genting highlands premium outlets in mid-june upon opening of the first and second floors of sky casino on march 30. the group is planning to open the third and fourth floors of sky casino, which are for vip and gold card members in the third quarter of finanial year 2017. we expect the number of visitors to improve from 19 million in 2015 to 24 million by 2018, on track to meet its target of 30 million by 2020. the increased visitations coupled with the potential availability of 300 new gaming tables are expected to drive its earnings growth, he said. according to cheah, genting valuation remains attractive when compared with ges and gem, particularly after the recent price appreciation of these subsidiaries. despite more optimistic projection, the key risks include regulatory risks and negative surprises from its key subsidiaries. genting is alliancedbss top pick for the gaming sector with a target price of rm11.50. with growing investor interest in ges and gem, we expect the valuation gap between genting and its intrinsic value to narrow going forward, he said."}, "33": {"date_posted": "13/7/2017", "title": "cover story: beyond earnings recovery ", "article": " investing in the stock market often gives players a rush of adrenaline, especially on the upside, but on this financial roller coaster, most people only want to experience the ups and not the downs. in malaysia, if you had been riding the fbm klci since the end of last year, that thrill is likely to have translated into a roughly 7.4% gain. investors are loving it, and after talking to market analysts, it is clear that optimism is running high as most believe malaysias corporate earnings are moving beyond recovery to growth. affin hwang investment bank chief economist alan tan tells the edge that the countrys first-quarter gross domestic product growth of 5.6% is likely to continue into the second quarter, supported by strong exports of semiconductor and commodity-related products. while we could see some moderation in the second half, gdp growth for the year is likely to be close to 5%, better than what we saw last year. this is in line with the imfs (international monetary fund) projection of 3.5% global growth compared with 3.1% last year. malaysia is also benefiting from the economic growth seen in the developed countries, for example the us, europe, japan, china and emerging asia. what we are seeing now is synchronised growth, which bodes well for the countrys economy, he says. the ceo of asset management company areca capital sdn bhd, danny wong, considers the stronger macroeconomic outlook as a key driver of the malaysian equity market. asia remains the engine of growth globally and malaysia, being a part of it, is showing signs of an uptick in data in terms of export. this would translate into better corporate earnings, especially for the export-oriented industry. coupled with the good sentiment that comes with a potential general election, the market is likely to remain buoyant until the end of the year, he adds. uob asset management (m) bhd executive director and ceo lim suet ling is also optimistic about the malaysian equity market for the rest of the year. although the fbm klci has rallied about 8% year to date, the domestic bourses gain would only put it somewhere in the middle compared with the other asian markets. we believe the rally has been underpinned by a few factors, including a net inflow of foreign funds, positive earnings momentum, an undervalued currency, and the transformation of government-linked companies. these factors continue to be relevant and we expect them to underpin a positive market tone in the next 12 months, she says. edmund tham, head of research at mercury securities sdn bhd, says the main thing to look out for in the second half is election play. construction and infrastructure will benefit the most from election play as we expect more contracts to be awarded in the second half. despite the rally seen so far, i dont think the market has fully priced in some of the projects, he adds. affin hwang ib head of research chue kwok-yan highlights three key triggers for malaysia this year that could pave the way for a long overdue stock market outperformance  equity market inflow, the ringgits return to a sustainable, strengthening path and the return of earnings growth. according to midf research, foreign fund flows into the equity market have trended upwards for most the year  out of 25 weeks, foreigners have been net sellers in only three. in line with this, jp morgan executive director of equity research mak hoy kit thinks major net foreign inflows will drive price-earnings expansion. with the year-to-date 7.6% rise in the fbm klci, one-year forward per (price-earnings ratio) has expanded from 15.6 times to 16.2 times u2026 in the reflationary cycle in 2009, we saw per multiples expand by 5.2 percentage points to 17 times within a year, followed by mean reversion when earnings started to catch up. the average per for the fbm klci over the last 10 years is 15.5 times, he says in his june 1 strategy report. hong leong investment bank head of retail and equity research loui low, however, warns that there could be a pullback in the market in the near term with the support level at 1,760 points.  what to look for in 2h2017 uob asset managements lim says she will be watching the construction sector in the second half as major projects, especially rail-related infrastructure and the pan borneo highway, are expected to be rolled out. we anticipate strong construction job flows and this is expected to sustain interest in the construction sector. identifiable contracts in the medium term include lrt3, the east coast rail link, the pan borneo highway and the remaining packages for mrt2. the construction sector is also on jp morgans radar with gamuda bhd remaining the top pick due to its exposure to more than rm241 billion of rail-related infrastructure spending. gamuda is also affin hwang ibs pick for big-cap construction exposure, as is wct holdings bhd. affin hwang ibs chue says wct is his top pick among mid-cap construction stocks with a 12-month target price of rm2.46. the stock is trading at rm2.07, indicating an upside of 18.8%. we believe wcts chances of securing more local contracts have improved after it secured its first mrt civil works package. the company pre-qualified to bid for the lrt3, west coast expressway and pan borneo highway projects. the change in its major shareholder could accelerate its plan to monetise its assets, such as the potential injection of two malls into a newly listed real estate investment trust this year and reduce its high net gearing of 0.95 times. we expect a strong three-year core earnings per share compound annual growth rate of 50% in fy2017 to fy2019, chue says. another fund manager who prefers to remain anonymous says george kent malaysia bhd is one of the mid-cap players in the sector that is likely to benefit from the infrastructure spending in the country. inari amertron bhd is one of affin hwang ibs top picks as it believes the electronic equipment manufacturers expansion into the new iris infrared chip (iris ir) could provide additional growth for the group. this [expansion into iris ir] and a steady improvement in the utilisation for its radio frequency business could drive our expected three-year forward net profit cagr of 26%, chue says. to an analyst with a local research house, globetronics technology bhd is a semiconductor player that has consistently delivered good results. the earnings visibility of globetronics has improved, especially with clearer signs from its new sensor products, particularly light sensors. the risk of a turnabout in the sensor business is also small, considering that light sensors are part of a critical component for its customers. hong leong ibs low believes this may be a good time to revisit the glove players that have had a rather quiet year in comparison with the market. the demand for gloves is still there and most of the glove players are very efficient in their management. the recent decline in raw material prices could re-ignite interest in the sector, he says. tokyo commodity exchange rubber future contracts had plunged 85.4% from a one-year high of u00a5367 seen at the beginning of the year to u00a5198 at the time of writing. an investment manager opines that other than gloves, the countrys largest condom manufacturer, karex bhd, appears attractive, especially after it fell 28.9% from a year ago. i think it is a bottom-fishing strategy for karex. with its distressed valuation, perhaps its a good time to accumulate for the long term. while the results are falling on the back of an intense pricing competition as well as sustained marketing expenses to build its own brand manufacturing (obm) business, karex has a strong track record.  consumer sentiment bottoming out other than construction, consumer sentiment has hit bottom, especially with the gradual recovery in the ringgit vis-u00e0-vis the us dollar, says lim. another fund manager agrees, naming oldtown bhd as one of his top picks, given the expansion of capacity in its fast moving consumer goods business in china. classic scenic bhd, one of insider asias top picks and which is featured in tongs value investing portfolio (page 18), is another counter that has continued to record better earnings. in its latest report, insider asia remains sanguine about the prospects for the worlds largest manufacturer and exporter of high-end wooden picture frame mouldings. we expect the company to maintain its growth momentum this year, underpinned by rising demand for its products on the back of the improving us economy and stronger housing market, it says. while the banking sector outperformed the market in the first half of the year, investors are optimistic that it will remain strong as it is a proxy for gdp growth. jp morgans mak says while the research house is more upbeat about banks, it will focus on quality banks, given the potential binary risk in a pick-up in non-performing loans. we have removed cimb holdings bhd, which has outperformed the fbm klci by 32% year to date, and replaced it with public bank bhd. cimb has outperformed public bank by 40% year to date, so we think it is time to make the switch. affin hwang ib, meanwhile, is positive about the big three, namely malayan banking bhd, public bank and cimb.  what to avoid in 2h2017 on what sectors to avoid, lim says uob asset management is cautious about telecommunications because of the competitive pressures while valuations have not reached levels that are deemed attractive. according to mak, jp morgan continues to avoid maxis bhd because of a potential negative dividend surprise and upcoming spectrum payments. malaysian reits have also been downgraded by affin hwang ib to neutral for tactical reasons. we are of the opinion that investors should allocate higher weightage to cyclical names in an economic upturn at the expense of more defensive and high-yield sectors like mreits, chue says. with oil prices staying below the us$50 per barrel level, investors are advised to be cautious about upstream oil and gas players. jp morgan believes the sector is likely to see utilisation and rate pressures, given the limited activity in the space. while optimism is riding high in malaysia, other markets, especially american, are showing signs of fatigue. with the dow jones industrial average and s&p 500 having reached historical highs last month, analysts have turned cautious. bill gross, co-founder of pimco  where he managed the worlds largest bond fund  and now a portfolio manager with janus henderson, warned last month that financial markets were increasingly at risk. however, bullish investors over here point out that the fbm klci is still 6.8% below its all-time-high close of 1,892.65 points in july 2014. certainly, those on the investing roller coaster should remember that what goes up must come down. but for now, barring unforeseen circumstances, the benchmark index should maintain its upward momentum, supported by overall positive sentiment.

", "article": " a key issue that arises from the proposed merger between rhb bank bhd and ammb holdings bhd is whether their common major shareholder, the employees provident fund (epf), will have voting rights in the deal. we need to understand the structure of the scheme to see our voting entitlements. we have to wait for that, the epfs ceo datuk shahril ridzuan tells the edge when asked about it. recall that this issue was a major stumbling block in the proposed banking mega merger of rhb, cimb group holdings bhd and malaysia building society bhd (mbsb) about 2u00bd years ago. bursa malaysias listing rules did not allow it to vote on the deal as it owned major stakes in all three entities. the epf, through two of the banks, applied for a waiver from the rules but bursa stood firm, even after an appeal was made on the matter. at that time, the epf was the single largest shareholder in rhb and mbsb with a 41.5% and 64.6% stake respectively, and held a 14.6% stake in cimb. bursa, in explaining its rejection, pointed out that the epfs position was not the same as the other shareholders in the companies. it said its controlling stakes in the two companies put it in a position of significant influence. it also believed the epf had prior knowledge of the proposed merger. the epf vote at that time was seen to be a crucial deciding factor on whether the cimb-rhb-mbsb merger would go through. the merger was later called off in early 2015 as the parties felt a worsening economic outlook no longer made it compelling. in the rhb-ammb case, the epf currently holds a 40.7% stake in rhb and 9.84% in ammb. interestingly, the epf has pared down its stake in ammb. in late march, it held 11.68.% and at end-2016, 14.94%. as a big shareholder in both banks, it raises the question as to whether it will be able to vote on the deals. bursas listing requirements, chapter 10.08(7), in a nutshell, states that in a meeting to obtain shareholder approval, a related party with any interest  direct or indirect  must not vote on the resolution in respect of a related party transaction (rpt). however, there are exceptions to a transaction being deemed an rpt, including if the major shareholder is a statutory institution who manages funds belonging to the general public. but, this is not so clear cut as there are also other considerations, depending on the case. it is understood that when this deal  which is now being worked out  comes to a vote, rhb, as the acquirer of ammbs assets and liabilities, would need 50%-plus-one-share approval from shareholders for it to go through. ammb, meanwhile, would require 75% shareholder approval in a special resolution vote. in rhbs analyst briefing last thursday, when asked whether key shareholders would be permitted to vote on both banks sides, its group managing director and ceo datuk khairussaleh ramli responded: this is something we have to analyse and engage with relevant authorities, including bursa, to check who would be able to vote. apart from the epf, rhbs other major shareholders are aabar investments pjs (17.75%) and osk groups tan sri ong leong huat (10.13%). aabars 17.75% stake in rhb is now parked under mubadala investment co  a bigger sovereign fund from abu dhabi. a key point to note is whether the epf ... is able to seek a waiver from regulators to allow them to vote in this deal. under the current ruling, they will not be allowed to vote as they own stakes in both rhb and ammb which raises the issue of conflict of interest. assuming the epf is not able to vote [at rhb] and that aabar may vote against the deal, it is crucial that the deal gets the support of osk and permodalan nasional bhd s funds, which on a combined basis would have an effective 39.6% stake in rhb  excluding the epf from the shareholders voting base. in such a scenario, the deal would require only 30% of the remaining minority shareholder to vote in favour to achieve a simple majority, uob kay hian research says in a june 2 report. over at ammb, its largest shareholder australia and new zealand banking group ltd (anz) wants to exit and has been looking to sell its 23.78% stake. anz had said last november that it planned to sell its stake over the next 12 to 18 month. ammbs next biggest shareholder is its founder and chairman tan sri azman hashim, who holds a substantial stake of 12.97%. he is retiring from all his positions within the group over the next two years, and hence, likely to be more open to paring down his stake.  all-share deal, asset and liability route the edge financial daily reported on june 2 that rhb and ammbs merger plan involves rhb buying all of the latters assets and liabilities in an all-share deal. rhb told analysts last thursday that it hoped to do the deal at one-time book value (bv). khairussaleh stressed that there would be no cash involved, the daily also learnt. this raises questions as to how anz would exit, if there is no cash. khairussaleh said that this was the right time for the two banks to go into a merger, particularly because both are trading at close to their bvs. so, if we can do it at book, that will be great. we minimise goodwill to optimise the financial outcome, he said. rhb was trading at a price to bv of 0.97 times prior to the merger u00adannouncement, while ammb was trading at 0.98 times. an industry observer points out that as both banks are trading just under one-time book value now and a share deal happens at book value, anz and any other shareholder could exit at a later date. assuming the share swap is done at book value for both banks, and none of the shareholders sell their stakes before completion of the merger, the shareholding structure post merger is likely to be: the epf with 27.9%, aabar at 10.2%, osk at 5.8%, anz at 10.2% and azman with 5.6%. it makes sense. its easier for anz to sell a 10% stake in an enlarged bank rather than a 24% stake in a smaller bank and it will be the same for rhb shareholders that may want to exit. placing out a 10% block in an enlarged banking group with a rm37 billion market capitalisation will be easier, i reckon, says a banking analyst that covers both the stocks, adding that an all-share deal would be less dilutive and that they can overcome the dilution in two to three years. maybank investment bank research says there is the risk of a potential share overhang should the major shareholders choose to exit. however, the combined shareholding of aabar, osk, anz and azman works out to be 31.5% post-merger and it would be a positive if a strategic shareholder could be identified to take up this block, it writes in a june 2 note. dbs group research notes: while it is still early days, what remains a risk is the acceptance by the other key stakeholders. deal-breakers for most m&as would be pricing or shareholders disapproval. the most recent banking merger in malaysia was between hong leong bank bhd and eon capital bhd in 2011, which was done at 1.4 bv (see chart). this was a period when banks return on equity (roe) and net interest margins were notably higher. in the current environment of u00adstricter capital requirements amid the competitive landscape, valuations may not necessarily be as attractive, public investment bank research says. upon resumption of trading last friday, rhb and ammbs shares fell. rhbs stock fell 3.71% to close at rm5.19 while ambank was down 2.3% to rm5.09. interestingly, the trading volume in both counters jumped last wednesday, the day before the stock was suspended. ammbs volume soared 546% from the day earlier to 28.5 million shares  over eight times its one-year daily average of 3.25 million. as for rhb, its volume rose 182% from the day earlier to 2.6 million shares, higher than its one-year daily average of 1.82 million. rhb and ammb, in separate stock exchange filings on june 1, said they had obtained bank negara malaysias approval, which is valid until nov 30, to start discussions for a possible merger of their business and undertakings. the two banks have now entered into a three-month exclusivity agreement, which expires on aug 30, to negotiate and finalise the pricing, structure, and other terms and conditions. they said there could be an automatic extension of the exclusivity period, if needed. the merger will make the enlarged group no 1 in asset management, general insurance and equities broking, and no 2 in islamic banking. it would also make it the ninth largest bank by assets in asean, creating a bigger platform for it to grow further at home and regionally. in an internal memo to staff on june 2, azman and ammb group ceo datuk sulaiman tahir said, given the challenging state of malaysias banking industry, a merger of this nature would allow ammb to tap onto greater opportunities. as a larger entity, there is greater potential to compete on a larger scale, including on a regional level. new possibilities for career advancement and professional development will certainly open up as the merger is expected to lead us into a much bigger league, they said. a day earlier, rhbs ceo had also sent a similar memo reassuring staff about the merger. indeed a merger between rhb and ammb would propel the total assets between them to rm365.88 billion, only slightly behind the rm380.05 billion of the third largest banking group, public bank bhd. ammb, on its own, is the sixth largest. while it is obvious the merger would bring about a larger banking group, banking analysts say significant cost synergies are required for the merged entity to be accretive. based on a back-of-the-envelope calculation on revenue attrition downside and cost synergies, uob kay hian estimates that the merged entity will be required to shed about 18% of its combined staff headcount of roughly 25,000 and 20% of other operating cost (for example, branches, it and marketing) for it to realise a positive uplift in roe from the current 8.3% to 10.0%. key to its assumption is a potential revenue attrition of 15%, which the research house believes is realistic given the inherent duplications within the merged entitys corporate and investment banking division. as the potential scale of such an exercise could involve an estimated 4,000 staff and closure of 80-100 branches, it will require a fair degree of gestation, it says. indeed, should the shareholders give the green light for the deal, the other hurdles to pass would be realising cost synergies and efficient execution of the exercise. now, that would be when the real marathon starts.

maybank", "article": " singapore (june 5): maybank kim eng research continues to rate raffles medical group (rmg) at buy as singapores leading integrated healthcare provider, with a robust track

current stock price largely reflecting solely the singapore operations, without fully accounting for its new hospitals in china. the research houses price target estimate, however, has been lowered to s$1.54, from s$1.67 previously, after accounting for greater expansion risks in china given higher execution risks for its shanghai and chongqing hospitals, both firsts for the group outside of

that rmgs singapore market, which still contributes to the majority of the groups earnings, should remain stable. he also believes the current weakness from medical tourism could be temporary, as patients who are deferring treatments due to a weak economy could possibly return. additionally, demand from local patients could improve as singapores economy recovers, says cheong. for [rmgs] china

"11/5/2017", "title": "cover story: cimb moves forward", "article": " last year, cimb group holdings bhd saw consumer banking become the largest contributor to its profit before tax  a first for the group, whose strength traditionally lay in investment banking. clearly, the group is no longer heavily reliant on the latter. has this been a conscious structural shift or a cyclical one? some may say tepid deal flow led to the smaller contribution of the fee income business, thus making sense of the increase in consumer banking. and it does not seem likely that wholesale banking  which includes investment banking, corporate banking and treasury and markets  will be the dominant income generator at cimb, like it was when the economic climate was conducive to deal making. in fact, growing consumer bankings income contribution is one of cimbs target 18 (t18) goals. the group outlined t18 in february 2015, targeting a return on equity of 15%, common equity tier 1 ratio of more than 11%, cost-to-income ratio of less than 50% and consumer banking income contribution of 60%  which includes contribution from commercial banking  by end-2018.  in an exclusive interview with the edge, group ceo tengku datuk seri zafrul aziz says the banking group is learning to engage with markets that it never focused on before. we want to go back to our natural market share. in malaysia, we should be top two [in the small and medium enterprise market] but were not [now]. weve been conservative in our engagement with the smes; weve been very corporate. even in consumer banking, weve always been preferred rather than mass. these are the markets that we need to tap into and where you will see growth as we start engaging with them. noting the huge potential of consumer banking, he says the business has done very well because of its smaller scale compared with wholesaling. nevertheless, stresses zafrul, who took over the ceos reins from chairman datuk seri nazir razak, cimb has not sidelined wholesale banking. indeed, it has managed to maintain its position on the league table. weve always told our staff that we cannot drop off the league table, says zafrul. analysts believe things will pick up in cimbs wholesaling this year as they expect the business to recover from last years low base effect. uob kay hian research has projected an 8% year-on-year growth in fee income this year. during the 2013 general election, brokerage and underwriting charges were the drivers of cimbs fee income growth, says the research house. meanwhile, cimb is starting to see the results of engaging with new market segments. last year, we were surprised to see loan growth of 10.5% in malaysia  double the industrys. all our segments grew and, yes, we went into markets we had never before. we could do that because we structured our team in such a way that we were clear about the areas we were weak in and we invested in them  technology, people and processes. it was simple for consumer banking. we grew the fastest in mortgages, personal financing and credit cards in malaysia because we were better in our data analytics and mining, which enabled us to better target customers that needed those products, explains zafrul, whose previous jobs were mainly in investment banking. in the financial year ended dec 31, 2016, consumer banking contributed rm2.27 billion or 46.4% to cimbs profit before tax while wholesale banking accounted for rm1.96 billion or 40.1%. revenue came in at rm16.05 billion, up 4% from the previous year, while net profit improved to rm3.56 billion from rm2.85 billion before.  are the targets being met? according to zafrul, since taking the hot seat at cimb two years ago, his journey has been challenging and humbling. the banking group saw significant changes in its leadership and strategy in a lacklustre economic environment. the economy grew but not as much as we thought it would. fortunately, given what we had done over the last two years, we have been able to navigate the difficult times, zafrul comments. when cimb launched t18 in 2015, its cost-to-income ratio stood at 59%. the aim was to reduce this to less than 50% by end-2018. as at fy2016, the group had managed to bring the ratio down to 53.9%. it more than achieved its t18 common equity tier 1 ratio as at fy2016, with 11.3%. we are halfway through t18 and we didnt expect the markets to be so challenging but we adjusted. despite our income not growing by 9% to 10% as anticipated, our common equity tier 1 ratio has improved because we made some very difficult decisions on cost and accelerated some of the things we needed to do, says zafrul. he credits members of his senior management, or his dream team, with helping drive t18 and meet its targets. analysts believe cimb is on track to achieve most of its t18 goals except roe, which zafrul admits may be difficult. says an analyst with a local bank, they are making progress u2026 but the roe target is off, which is why management revised it down to between 10.5% and 11% from 15%. that they would miss the target was expected, given the current difficult operating environment at home and abroad like in indonesia and thailand. an analyst with a foreign bank concurs. they are on track but it is not possible to meet the 15% roe target they have for t18. i think they should be able to get to 9.5% this year. while an roe of 15% is out of the banking groups reach now, zafrul says it should be at least on a par with or better than that of its regional peers by 2018. cimbs roe stood at 8.3% as at fy2016, falling short of its 10% target for the year due to impairments. our engine is running well with revenue hitting rm16 billion last year. we are managing cost better and weve focused on ensuring theres no capital dilution. what we need to improve on now is to be more vigilant for asset quality. malaysia has been a good story of how we have managed to maintain low provisions and impairments. but we need to make sure our regional operating model and our teams overseas continue to improve on this. if they do that, our numbers would be better, provided that the other aspects continue to grow as well, says zafrul. cimb is expecting loan impairment to be lower this year than in fy2016 as it is expecting the thai, indonesian and singaporean markets to grow and the home market to remain stable. we are more optimistic about this year because we think the indonesian economy is finally turning around and being one of the largest banks there, we will see an improvement. last year, loan growth in that country was zero, comments zafrul. maybank investment research says asset quality in indonesia has yet to show any sign of recovery with the industrys non-performing loan ratio rising to 3.1% in january this year from 2.9% in december 2016. nevertheless, pt bank cimb niaga tbk has not seen a significant increase in npls. cimb niagas credit cost is expected to gradually decline to below 200bps by end-fy2017 but guidance is that it should average around 200bps to 220 bps in fy2017 versus an average of 273bps in fy2016, says the research house. it adds that there is upside potential for earnings if credit costs surprise positively. this is based on its forecast that every 5bps reduction in credit cost will improve earnings by 3%. while only halfway through t18, the banking group is already pondering its next move. zafrul says post-t18, cimb will probably focus on growth. in the meantime, the banking group unveiled its new tagline: forward. forward is cimbs evolution. weve had asean for you for eight years now and were transitioning to forward. were changing our proposition: its about moving forward. moving from an investment bank to a universal bank to a regional universal bank and today, we need to move forward for our customers. forward means to position ourselves to move forward for our stakeholders, customers, staff and shareholders. this is also a part of t18 because we want people to work better together as a team. the whole bank is complex as it cuts across divisions and geographies to work as one. [we want to] cut the silos. it has to come together as one, zafrul asserts. its about focusing on the customers, staff and shareholders. its about the people. over the last one year, cimbs share price has gained nearly 28%, from rm4.50 to rm5.75 last wednesday. maybank research has a buy call and target price of rm6.30 on the counter. it says valuations are still decent with the stock trading at a prospective fy2017 price-earnings ratio of 11.1 times. uob kay hian research maintains its hold call on the share with a target price of rm5.60. it opines that the banking groups strong earnings recovery has been factored into the share price, as reflected in its earnings growth assumption of 21% for this year."}, "41": {"date_posted": "9/5/2017", "title": "klci pares losses on axiata, westports", "article": " kuala lumpur (may 9): the fbm klci fell 1.59 points or 0.1% as the index pared losses on axiata group bhd and westports holdings bhd share gains. at 5pm, the klci closed at 1,766.56 points after falling to its intraday low at 1,765.14 points. investors took profit after the klci rose to its intraday high at 1,770.43 points. yesterday, the index climbed 5.41 points to 1,768.15 points as emmanuel macron's win in france's presidential election improved world market sentiment. today, maybank investment bank bhd chartist nik ihsan raja abdullah told theedgemarkets.com that the klci had fallen on genting bhd, genting malaysia bhd, misc bhd and malayan banking bhd (maybank) share losses. genting bhd fell eight sen to rm9.72, genting malaysia dropped two sen to rm5.74, misc declined nine sen to rm7.35 while maybank was three sen lower at rm9.36. investors were battering down these four counters today but the losses were mitigated by continued support in axiata and westports today,\" nik ihsan said. axiata rose three sen to rm5.25 while westports added six sen to rm3.92. across bursa malaysia, 3.23 billion shares worth rm2.74 billion exchanged hands. a total of 427 counters ended higher versus 455 decliners. iskandar waterfront city bhd (iwcity) was the most-active stock with 237.62 million shares traded. the stock fell 55 sen to rm1.61 to become the second-largest decliner. tomorrow (may 10), malaysian markets will be closed for the wesak day holiday. markets reopen on thursday (may 11). on thursday, the statistics department will announce the country's industrial output numbers at 12 noon. the malaysian palm oil board will announce the sector's output, inventory and export figures at about 12:30pm.

remarks the investment banker. the head of another local ib concurs. it is for sure a more active market this year. apart from having more deals in the pipeline, we are also busy pitching for more ipo jobs. we are definitely more active this year, he reveals. the stock market started heating up from january, with the fbm klci peaking at 1,754.67  its highest close in 22 months  on march 23. the benchmark index had gained 5.92% this year as at the april 19 close of 1,738.95. but it was only from february that daily trading volumes got noticeably stronger. the average since february is 3.2 billion shares compared with 1.69 billion shares in the same period last year. the average daily trading value, meanwhile, is rm2.63 billion compared with rm1.94 billion in the same period last year. its a clear indication that investor interest is back. with those kind of daily average volumes, you know that syndicates and speculation activity are back. it is not necessarily a bad thing as it lifts overall market sentiment, says the earlier investment banker. improved sentiment helps create appetite for new listings, he adds. he, nevertheless, cautions that ibs may have just a small window to ride the current positive sentiment. with [us president donald] trumps warmongering and geopolitical tensions, a major correction or crash could be coming. thats my view, he says, adding that this could dampen appetite for new listings. so far this year, there have been six new listings  three on the main market (kip reit, serba dinamik holdings bhd, eco world international bhd) and the rest on the ace market (hlt global bhd, matang bhd, eversafe rubber bhd)  that collectively raised rm3.47 billion. the latest was eversafes, a tyre retreading firm, which was listed just last friday. eversafes shares made available for the malaysian public was oversubscribed by a whopping 64.99 times. the rm2.58 billion raised from eco worlds listing  the years biggest so far  earlier this month already exceeds the total of rm1.03 billion raised in malaysia last year from 12 listings. in 2013, some rm3.88 billion was raised from 13 new listings. among the big ipos anticipated in the market this year is south korean conglomerate lotte groups malaysian petrochemical unit, sometime in the third quarter. the listing of lotte chemical titan holding bhd on bursa malaysias main market could reportedly raise as much as us$1.5 billion, which would make it one of the biggest in the region this year. in malaysia, there has not been an ipo that raised over us$1 billion since the 2012 flotations of astro malaysia holdings bhd (us$1.5 billion), felda global ventures holdings bhd (us$3.3 billion) and ihh healthcare bhd (us$2.1 billion). maybank investment bank bhd is the principal adviser on the lotte chemical ipo. apart from lotte chemical, the other anticipated big ipo is that of qsr brands (m) holdings sdn bhd, which sources say could be relisted either this year or the next. news reports indicate that it could raise rm1.6 billion or more. qsr has picked citigroup, credit suisse and maybank ib to lead the ipo, bloomberg reported last november, citing sources familiar with the matter. qsr operates the kfc and pizza hut restaurant franchises in malaysia. smaller ipos this year include that of building contractor inta bina group bhd  which plans to list on the ace market in the second quarter  and earthworks and civil engineering services group advancecon holdings bhd on the main market in mid-year. the size of the ipo matters to the ibs as they generally take a percentage of the amount raised as their fee. in any ipo, ibs usually earn the most from placement, underwriting and advisory fees, in that order, bankers say. for underwriting, ibs generally earn around 2% of the amount raised from the ipo, says an investment banker. this falls on the lower end of the scale of what ibs earn in the region. given the stiff competition at home, ibs sometimes agree to lower fees in order to land the job, he explains. among the busiest ibs for the ipos so far this year are maybank ib, cimb investment bank bhd and m&a securities sdn bhd. maybank ib, in particular, is one to watch given that it seems to be involved in all the big ipos to come. it was the joint adviser to eco worlds ipo, together with cimb ib and hong leong investment bank bhd. m&a, a wholly-owned subsidiary of insas bhd, has been involved in ace market listings, including that of matang in january, which raised rm16.9 million, and the upcoming inta bina ipo. the second biggest listing so far this year  serba dinamiks on feb 8, which raised rm584.1 million, had affin hwang investment bank bhd and rhb investment bank bhd as joint advisers.

outlook remains challenging in view of the countrys subdued consumer spending, shrinking advertising expenditure and currency volatility. while newsprint prices are expected to remain firm, they may have an adverse impact should the ringgit continue to u00addepreciate against the us dollar. the groups travel business, meanwhile, is expected to continue to face difficult market conditions amid growing safety and security concerns as well as cut-throat competition, he says. having said that, we understand that the group will continue to step up efforts to diversify its revenue stream, such as e-commerce, and focus on improving operational efficiencies, he says. hlib research analyst nafisah azmi says mcil is expected to face more challenges due to soft adex expectations, slowing economy in greater china and the continued decline in the tourism industry in europe. although we favour mcil for its prudent cost management and strong cash generative business, we believe that adex will remain soft mainly due to macro headwinds and poor consumer sentiment, she says. hlib research maintains its hold call with an unchanged target price of 61 sen, based on a per of 9.5 times. as widely expected, no dividend was declared for the third quarter as mcil normally rewards its shareholders in the second and fourth quarters of each financial year. however, it is learnt that management intends to distribute a minimum 50% of its profit as dividend or to provide for a 6% dividend yield. previously, mcil had said it might reward its shareholders with a special dividend from the disposal of one media group ltd for hk$498 million. if there is money, of course we can [consider], mcil executive director and ceo francis tiong kiew chiong told reporters after the groups annual general meeting on aug 12 last year. kiew chiong is a distant relative of group executive chairman tan sri tiong hiew king. we have to fulfil the condition precedent, a circular has to be issued to shareholders, and we have to convene an egm (extraordinary general meeting). after we have gone through that process, then only the money will come in. we can talk about a special dividend after that, executive director patrick leong chew meng said. mcil is expected to see a net gain of hk$363 million from the sale of its 73% stake in one media to chinese state-owned company, qingdao west coast holdings international ltd. the hong kong-listed one media is a media subsidiary of mcil focusing on greater china. apart from ming pao weekly in hong kong, one media also publishes ming watch magazine in china and hong kong, and topgear magazine in china, hong kong and taiwan. at its current price, mcil is offering a ttm dividend yield of 6.7%. the bermuda-incorporated firm declared a dividend per share (dps) of 1.1 us cents, 0.93 us cent, 1.43 us cents in fy2016, fy2015 and fy2014 respectively. it is worth noting that mcil paid a bumper dividend of 13 us cents in november 2012, bringing its total dps in fy2013 to 14.68 us cents.

(see also: dbs 1q net profit up 1% to record $1.2 bil on fee income) the latest quarters results were in line with the expectations of the two research houses, which both see positive signs and hence raise their roe and fy17f net profit estimates for the group accordingly. however, rhb analyst leng seng choon says he sees a limited share price upside from here as he believes dbs is trading close to its historical price-to-book ratio u2013 while maybanks ng li hiang thinks provisions will stay elevated in the year ahead even as new nonperforming asset (npa) formation is likely to ease. we forecast non-performing loans (npl) ratio to rise to 1.6% by end-2017, from 1.4% in 1q17. whilst stress from the oil & gas sector has somewhat abated, the risk remains if crude oil price stays weak. a challenging economic environment could also pull up the npl ratio, says leng in a report on wednesday.  noting that dbs has gained singapores mortgage loan share over the past two years, rhb projects 2017 loan growth of 4% for the group as well as net interest income (nii) expansion of 2% u2013 even as the groups management guided for 2017 net interest margin (nim) to be close to its 2016s average of 1.77-1.78% in the case of only one more us fed rate hike this year. on the other hand, maybank is largely retaining its fy17-19 provision estimates which the research house believes will stay elevated. despite healthy loans growth at 7% y-o-y in constant currency terms, nii was flat q-o-q / y-o-y, and customer spreads fell slightly to 1.99%. we believe lending yields could be under compression from market share gains/competition, remarks ng in a separate report on the same day. in ngs view, the groups wealth management (wm) fees in particular are poised to contribute to higher non-interest income which will in turn provide support to total income. if we strip out the amortised bancassurance contributions from manulife of s$26.5 million per quarter, wm fees grew a remarkable 49% q-o-q/31% y-o-y. we believe dbs is well-positioned in its digitalisation efforts and capabilities to capture market share gains in wm, he adds. meanwhile, uob kay hian maintains its buy rating on dbs while also raising its target price on the stock to s$23.30 from s$21.50 previously on the account of npl formation and specific provisions easing sequentially. npl formation and specific provisions have peaked and uncertainties from exposure to the oil & gas sector have diminished. dbs has a track record of consistency in execution and delivering good results, elaborates analyst jonathan koh in a wednesday report.  in addition to the turnaround in nim, koh continues to like the stock post 1q17 results, noting strong sequential recovery from the wealth management segment; improved cost efficiency which has led to reduced operating expenses; as well as the easing of pressure on asset quality over the past quarter. the research house has hence raised its net profit forecast for 2017 and 2018 by 6.9% and 8.2% respectively, citing strong growth in fees and moderation in npl formation and credit costs. as at 10.37pm, shares of dbs are trading 3.57% higher at s$20.57.

petroleum exporting countries deal, plantations stocks hardly rallied when crude palm oil (cpo) prices went up from last november through mid-february. the inertia was due to scepticism over just how long the cpo price rally would last. after all, palm oil production had begun to recover from the impact of the 2015-2016 mega el niu00f1o weather pattern that crimped palm oil production in indonesia and malaysia last year. experts anticipation of a recovery in production this year, similar to that of 1999 following the 1997-1998 super el niu00f1o, was a bearish factor, and caused cpo prices to reach as high as rm3,348 on feb 10 (malaysian palm oil board fob spot). it settled at rm2,994 last thursday. but some experts now speak of a smaller cpo production recovery, pointing to what they call a 50% chance of the el niu00f1o weather pattern emerging here in the second half or as early as june. at the time of writing, the chances for an el niu00f1o from august through december this year have climbed above 50% (but below 55%), according to the data on us national oceanic and atmospheric administrations (noaa) website on march 13. depending on its severity, [an el niu00f1o by 3q2017] will have minimal impact on this years palm oil production because the impact will be on 2018s numbers. if there is no el niu00f1o in the second half, 2018 will be a fantastic year [in terms of production]. now, were uncertain because if el niu00f1o comes, production will be affected, says ling ah hong, director of ganling sdn bhd, noting that there is an at least six-month delay in the impact on production. the lag effect on palm oil is scientifically proven. its been observed. theres the first lag [six months], the second [nine to 12 months] and the third [22 to 24 months]. thats how we are able to do the [forecast] model. last year was so bad because the first and second lags coincided. if the drought is 12 months long, that meant the first effect was seen six months later. but the second drought came, so the effect was rolled down, ling tells the edge, explaining how the 2015 drought hit production in 2016 and how the impact on trees can differ. because the [recent mega] el niu00f1o was so strong, the drop in yields lasted for nine months, from january [2016], and the worst hit was august. so, 3q2016 [production] was bad and prices went up and up. the el niu00f1o weather pattern can cause severe drought (dry weather) and water shortage in plantations in this region while la niu00f1a usually brings abundant rain. historically, a (mild) la niu00f1a that follows an el niu00f1o usually assists in yield recovery for oil palm trees, explains ling. it is quite surprising that el niu00f1o is emerging so fast. the shortest gap in the last 50 years was two years. the longest could be seven years. if it emerges this year, it will be two years [2015 was the last]. it is not unprecedented, ling says, adding that 2018s cpo production could be down 6% to 7% if we get a moderately strong el niu00f1o in 2h2017. actually, it is good for prices. plantations wont be so badly affected with a 6% drop because they have young planting, which will help to mitigate [earnings], says ling, who expects this years cpo production to be above 2016s but behind 2015s. what does this scenario mean for investors looking at plantation stocks? ivy ng, head of research and regional plantations analyst at cimb research in kuala lumpur, expects a flattish to marginal rise in planters earnings in 2017 as lower cpo prices are offset by higher output this year. ng  who retains a neutral stance on regional planters share prices and recommends that investors be selective in picking stocks in the sector in a march 9 note  likes singapore-listed indonesian planter first resources ltd (target price: s$2.32) for its young tree age profile, indonesian-listed pt astra agro lestari tbk (target price: idr18,000) for good corporate governance and genting plantations bhd (target price: rm12.30) for its strong output growth prospects. another regional plantations analyst is also in favour of planters with younger palm trees as they not only stand to benefit from the expected production recovery but would also have more palm trees entering prime production (years seven to 18, although trees start bearing fruit in the third year). the increased production means the companies will have more fresh fruit bunches (ffb) and cpo to sell, a factor that can compensate for the lower average cpo selling prices achieved before, she explains. cimbs ng notes in her report that there were more bears than bulls this year in terms of cpo price predictions at the recent annual palm and lauric oils conference (poc). price predictions ranged from rm2,200 to rm3,100 per tonne. we deduced the mean to be around rm2,649 per tonne, ng says, noting how the most bullish forecaster at poc, dorab mistry, director of godrej international ltd, projected that prices would touch rm3,000 a tonne in the near term before falling to rm2,500 in june to july. meanwhile, james fry, chairman of lmc international ltd, expected cpo prices to fall as low as rm2,250 per tonne due to rising palm oil supplies. price predictions for 2016 ranged from rm2,200 to rm3,200 per tonne or an average of rm2,536, but the actual trading range was from rm2,181 to rm3,239 per tonne and the rm2,653 average price was 4.6% higher, as the speakers had not expected production to fall that much. in the past 11 years, actual average cpo prices were above the predictions made for poc2006, poc2007, poc2009 and poc2010, but came in below those for poc2008 as well as those for poc2011, poc2012, poc2013, poc2014 and poc2015, cimbs data show. other than the potential emergence of el niu00f1o later this year, other key bullish factors for cpo prices mentioned by the speakers include indonesias plan to expand its biodiesel usage to non-public service obligations (non-pso) sectors, as well as expectations that china would halt the release of rapeseed oil reserves this year. uob kay hian research in a march 15 note said indonesias biodiesel uptake could surge to six million kilolitres this year, from about 3.3 million kilolitres last year, as the government makes adjustments in view of the potential downside pressure on cpo prices in 2h2017 on stronger cpo production. the indonesia estate crop fund (bpdp) expects the biodiesel procurement volume to match or be marginally higher this year, but could adjust the price of biodiesel lower and extend a subsidy to the non-pso segment. the research house  which expects cpo prices to average rm2,600 a tonne this year and rm2,500 a tonne next year (compared with rm2,653 last year) and acknowledges that there is a risk of a shortfall in biodiesel mandates on lower global crude oil prices  likes singapore-listed bumitama agri (target price: s$1.25) for its young tree age profile and consistent delivery of high oil extraction rates (oer). we also like first resources (target price: s$2.15) for its efficiency in keeping costs low and strong ffb production growth, kim loong resources bhd (target price: rm4.20), astra agro lestari (target price: idr19,045) and sampoerna agri (target price: idr2,190). yet, the chances of an el niu00f1o re-emerging later this year, in addition to the fact that the mpobs february stockpile of 1.46 million tonnes is a six-year low, seem to pale in comparison to the sharp contraction in cpo exports in early march. maybank investment bank regional plantations analyst ong chee ting, for one, is not betting on an el niu00f1o in 2h2017 just yet. recall that the el niu00f1o scare at the start of 2014 turned out to be a non-event, ong told clients in a march 13 note. he has turned cautious on the plantations sector although he reckons the recent cpo price selldown was overdone given the low stockpile and reckons a short-term rebound in cpo prices is possible before prices resume their downward trend going into 2h2017. he is keeping an eye on cpo export trends after independent cargo surveyors intertek and sgs preliminary export estimates for the first 10 days of march suggested a sharp 26% month-on-month decline. while it is still early days, we suspect this sharp contraction in exports was due to a sudden pullback in purchase orders as importers were hoping to buy palm oil at lower prices when the price suddenly fell more than 10% month-on-month in february. nonetheless, this trend is worth monitoring. maybank investment bank has buy calls on boustead plantations bhd (target price: rm1.78), sarawak oil palms bhd (target price: rm4.70), singapore-listed bumitama agri (target price: s$0.96), indonesia-listed astra agro lestari (target price: idr19,000), london sumatra (target price: idr1,470) and tunas baru lampung (target price: idr1,500). thomas mielke, director and editor at ista mielke gmbh, which publishes independent forecasting service oil world, is less concerned about near-term export fluctuations. speaking at the poc, mielke predicted that global supplies of eight major edible oils will increase by 10 million tonnes this year but that would only partly replenish stock drawdowns in the previous year. he reckons that palm oil prices have peaked this year but deems that the february price declines were overdone, adding that cpo prices have to be sufficiently attractive for producers to invest and expand. ling does not think the pace of oil palm planting will return to that enjoyed at the height of the commodities boom, owing to greater pressures on sustainability and environment-related concerns. up until 2020, we will see good production growth in indonesia because planters are planting u2026 but after 2020, most of these trees will have reached their peak. the slowdown in planting started in 2013 because thats when the indonesian government signed the [first] moratorium [with norway]. the greatest slowdown was from 2014/2015 when the non-governmental organisations got very stringent and planters had to do a lot more sustainability studies u2026 and there is the natural slowdown because of lower

2017. it has been a little over two years since joel kornreich, group ceo of alliance financial group bhd (afg), came on board the countrys smallest banking group by assets. having laid out a clear strategy with his team to build on afgs strength in the small and medium enterprise (sme) segment, the group now plans to make substantial investments in the coming financial year in some cutting-edge new products and initiatives in that space. these include ramping up a loan consolidation service that was launched late last year  it basically consolidates all of a borrowers loans into one account for convenience  and introducing foreign remittance services through mobile phones. these are just two examples but theres more to come. its actually nice to be able to speak about things that are concrete because its happening. its all coming together now, kornreich tells the edge. he shares that afg will incur capital expenditure of more than rm150 million on the new technology-based products and initiatives in the financial year ending march 31, 2018 (fy2018)  a move that will take a toll on the groups profitability and return on equity (roe) that year. to put things in perspective, rm150 million is more than what afg has earned in each of at least its last five quarters. in its latest quarter of 3qfy2017, it made a net profit of rm129.7 million. of course, our profitability [in fy2018] is going to temporarily dip a bit because were going to be investing a lot in resources and distribution to get those strategic projects going. we think were still going to be doing double-digit roe u2026 but it is going to be a considerable investment, kornreich says. he guides that the decline in afgs net profit in fy2018 will not be significant, likely coming in at under 10%. kornreich is however optimistic that revenue will continue to grow at a higher single-digit rate than in fy2017. as for roe, the group has abandoned an earlier aspiration to hit 15% in fy2018 as that is no longer realistic. afgs roe stood at 10.8% as at the nine months of fy2017, making it the second-best performing local banking group by that measure after public bank bhd. with the investment, coming out of the first year, roe will be closer to 10%. we are aiming to get it back up somewhere between 12% and 15% but its going to take us two to three years to get there, kornreich remarks. he stresses that despite the short-term negative impact on afgs profitability, the investments in the strategic projects are meant to be transformative and will pave the way for longer-term benefits for the group. the essence of our strategy is to help business owners help themselves and other people, he says. we call it building alliances to improve lives because its really us going to the business owners and saying, look, we can help you, and we can help your employees, family and retail customers. the new offerings in afgs pipeline basically fulfil this ideal, kornreich explains. given that 60% of afgs sme customer base comprises retailers, he is particularly keen on a new proposition that he hopes to launch in october for retail smes. today, banks propositions to retailers are not very sophisticated. they facilitate payments and if they like you a lot, they might lend you some money. that misses a lot of the needs that retailers have, kornreich observes. having done intensive research, afg hopes to fulfil those needs with its upcoming technology-based solution for retailers.  going it alone given its small balance sheet relative to that of other banks, afgs sweet spot has long been in servicing small businesses, leaving the large corporations to the bigger banks. according to kornreich, it makes sense for afg to continue to rely on its niche in the sme space to spur future growth. were known in the market for good growth. right now, growth in the market for smes is 6% to 7% but were still tracking 12% to 13%, so were definitely growing much faster than the market, he says, adding that asset quality in this segment is stable. it is worth noting that afgs gross impaired loan (gil) ratio in the sme space, at 0.8%, is much lower than the industrys 2.5%. however, with an increasing number of banks looking to expand their sme segment more aggressively in recent years, some wonder if afgs sme-focused model is sustainable. some think the group may be better off merging with a rival bank so that it can compete more effectively as the banking environment gets tougher. indeed, given its size and recent movements in shareholding, afg is often singled out as an m&a target. there was market talk in the past that afg would make a decent fit with ammb holdings bhd compared with the larger local banks. acquiring afg would do little to boost the size of the larger banks. combined, the afg-ammb entity would be the third largest player in the sme space after maybank and public bank. analysts whom the edge spoke to reckon that afg can continue to stay as a standalone bank for now. it can still survive [on its sme niche]. the sme space is big enough. if you look at the final quarter of last year, most banks recorded double-digit loan growth in the segment, which shows that there is still room to grow, says imran yassin yusof of midf research. he notes that competing in this segment is not just about reaching out to smes but also about having close relationships with them. on this front, afg is known to have the edge over the larger banks. the reality is that it is a very tough playing ground for the smaller banks in this industry. for now, afg will survive, but in the longer term, consolidation is inevitable. having said that, there are boutique banks everywhere in the world, and there could be space for that in malaysia, another banking analyst says.  last april, singapore hotelier ong beng seng and two others  ong tiong sing and corporate adviser seow lun hoo  bought the entire equity interest in langkah bahagia sdn bhd, which holds a 51% stake in verticle theme sdn bhd, which in turn has a 29.06% stake in afg. singapores sovereign wealth fund temasek holdings, through its unit duxton investments pte ltd, holds the remaining 49% in verticle theme. this means that temasek and the three individuals, whom analysts believe to be parties friendly to the sovereign fund, collectively own a major 29.06% stake in afg. this sparked market talk that the move would eventually lead to singapore banking group dbs group holdings bhd, of which temasek is the single largest shareholder, or some other suitor merging with afg. kornreich declines comment on such speculation. frankly, from our perspective, were really focused on trying to improve the bank. the plan is to grow organically within malaysia, he says.  small but strong afg fared decently in the first nine months of fy2017 with net profit growing 1% to rm394.7 million, which was within analysts expectations. positively, it had better control of costs and its net interest margin (nim) widened in the third quarter  by nine basis points from the preceding quarter to 2.31%. on the downside, loan loss provisions in the nine months grew 57.5% year on year to rm67.4 million. were now no 2 in terms of roe in the market. weve been able to slow down roe erosion quite substantially by optimising and choosing the portfolios that we go after, says kornreich. the group plans to continue its focus on higher risk-adjusted return (rar) loans, namely working capital and sme and personal loans. over the last nine months, higher rar loans grew 14.6% while lower rar loans  mortgages, hire purchase and some segments of corporate banking  contracted 1.4%. kornreich says that afg is aiming for overall loan growth of between 5% and 6% in fy2018. we had slowed down considerably in the mortgage space. our plan is to restart that but in a slightly different way, using innovation, he says, adding that a good portion of mortgage growth will be through the loan consolidation service. the groups overall gil ratio remains sound at 1%  much lower than the industrys 1.6%  despite making higher provisions in the third quarter for residential and personal loans. our ballpark range for gil ratio in fy2018 is between 1.1% and 1.4%, kornreich says. on afgs plan to transfer its listing status to its banking unit alliance bank malaysia bhd under a corporate reorganisation that involves a simple share swap, he says the exercise will likely be completed in the third quarter of this year instead of the second. the delay is just administrative, kornreich clarifies. the reorganisation is meant to improve cost and corporate efficiency. as for dividends in fy2018, amid higher investment costs, the group is aiming for a stable payout ratio of between 40% and 60%, which is its stated policy. bloomberg data shows that out of 15 analysts who track the stock, most, or eight, of them have a neutral call on it while only three have a buy recommendation. their average 12-month target price is rm4.01. the stock closed at rm4.05 last thursday. while we are positive on the improvement in the groups nim as well as its focus on a better rar strategy, in the near term, credit cost is expected to normalise with lower recoveries. also, its expenses on its it-related investments to offer new value propositions to its customers will impact its earnings in fy18 as it will raise its operating expenditure before longer-term benefits to revenue can be realised, says kelvin ong, banking analyst at aminvestment bank research, in explaining his hold call on the stock. an exceprt from the interview with kornreich follows.  we see a great deal of opportunity to develop our retail bank   the edge: are there plans to sell non-core assets of the bank? joel kornreich: there are no immediate plans, but i think that you are touching on an interesting topic, which is the relationship between the complexity and the size of a bank. the bank is small. either we find ways to reduce complexities, which is not out of the question, or we find a way to increase the size, so we can handle the complexities. it is true that while we have a very efficient bank, that is, great return on equity (roe), great positioning with the sme, good prospects and obviously the bank is quite profitable, very good cost-to-income ratio and asset quality, it is also true that everybody is dealing with pressures that increase either complexities or cost. so this is a good question, to see how we can make sure that the ratio of complexity to our size doesnt grow so much that it becomes an impediment to the development or to the profitability of the bank. we do take it seriously. we do not have immediate plans to sell core assets, but i will say this: for us to figure out what we want to develop and do more intensively, and what we would like not to do, is an important question.  at this point, what would you like to focus less on? what would you consider non-core? for sure, what we know and will continue to focus more on is sme. we are going to focus more on the business owners and we are going to significantly develop our retail bank. we have, in fact, made a lot of progress. our wealth management business has grown quite substantially over the past year, around 21% year on year. it is still small, but we see a great deal of opportunity to develop our retail bank. clearly, it has been under-powered. do you see stress bubbling in the sme space? its true that things have been more difficult in the last couple of years than they were before. i dont think that theyre going to be significantly more difficult in the year or two ahead. in fact, i think that theres a good chance that as the economy benefits from the infrastructure projects that trickle down, there might actually be an improvement. at least, thats the hope. you know, the economy goes in cycles. so if you have a down cycle, at some point youre going to have an up cycle, right? the question is, when does that up cycle happen?  so, at what point of the down cycle are we in now? are we more than halfway through? listening to the people (entrepreneurs and business folks) who speak to us, we see a lot more optimism among our business partners. clearly in some sectors, things have recovered already. palm oil and steel have risen very significantly over the past 12 months, and the risk of a hard landing by china has receded. things are getting better. there are restrictions. the market is not flooded anymore by some of these goods from china which was creating pressure for folks. commodity prices have overall recovered, so that is quite a big (part) of the sector. clearly, the retail real estate development sector is still very much under stress because of current consumer sentiment, but at the same time, developers and people involved in construction are seeing a lot of opportunities from the infrastructure projects, displacing these issues as well. there are at least some sectors in which you can see improvements; for example, anything that is infrastructure related. there is definitely hope coming down the pipeline, and obviously that would trickle down to other sectors in the economy. manufacturing is always spotty. there is never a time where it is completely bad or completely good. some manufacturers are doing okay, and some manufacturers are having a tougher time. for example, exporters had a great run in the second half of 2015 and a good part of 2016. they are now finding that there is a little bit of additional pressure in the system where their input costs have risen because of imported inflation, and so those advantages have kind of eroded a bit. so they need to think about things a little differently but they are still doing quite well. that is why we think that things havent turned yet for consumers. that is very obvious, but there could be good reason to think that it will in the not too distant future.  within the next 12 months? yes, i am hoping so. it takes time to work its way through the system.  what is all this going to mean for your asset quality? have provisions already peaked? there is always a lag, so we think that next year (fy2018) we will still see incremental increase in credit cost. i am hoping not, but that is what we have planned for. if what we think is correct, things are going to start to improve again. a lot of our competitors have had to make very large provisions, because of exposure to oil and gas and other things in the past 12 months. we dont quite compare the same way. our loan loss coverage ratio is 137%, which is high. i dont think we are going to see a big rise in provisions, except for one thing  ifrs 9, the new financial reporting standard. when that comes up, depending on the portfolio, we will have increases of 25% to 50% of the current collective allowance level. since our provision level is not very high in relation to our capital (it is quite modest), it is fine. it will not have a huge impact on us.

fund managers and analysts are generally still cautious on the sector despite some indicators showing signs of improvement. the traction seen with banking stocks could be due to several reasons, according to the fund managers. firstly, the recovery of commodity prices has reignited confidence among investors, given that many banks are exposed to commodity-related companies. crude oil prices have recovered. this means that banks that have exposure to the oil and gas sector may see fewer provisions from this sector. this has sort of given investors more confidence in banks, says phillip capital management sdn bhd chief investment officer ang kok heng. besides, bank valuations look much cheaper now compared with what they were previously. price-to-book ratios average 1.3 times while the price-earnings ratios average 13 times. however, the fund managers agree that there is not much excitement for the banking sector from the earnings point of view. manulife asset management services bhd head of equities tock chin hui has turned neutral on the sector from being underweight. she says most negatives for banks have been priced in, except for a significant deterioration in asset quality. she adds that with commodity prices on the rebound and brighter prospects globally, she does not see asset quality deteriorating significantly for now. that said, we still find it hard to be bullish on the sector as there is no general improvement in key trends. we expect the operating environment to remain challenging. banks roe (return on equity) has deteriorated from 15% to 16% to the low teens while loan and deposit growth is likely to remain weak. hence, it is challenging to expect valuations to revert to historical levels without any major macro improvement, tock says. as far as the tough operating environment is concerned, ang says the lifeline for banks  loans  has been growing at a slow pace, with no indicator showing an improvement going forward. with loan growth slowing down significantly, the opportunity for better profits diminishes as well. banks are also facing compressed nims (net interest margins) because of stiff competition among peers. its not a very exciting sector now, he says.  improvement in business loans gives promise? while loan growth is a far cry from the double-digit increase seen a few years ago, it is still a relief to see the indicator picking up in january. the latest banking data released by bank negara malaysia shows that loan growth rose to 5.6% year on year at the end of that month, compared with 5.3% at end-december 2016. the improvement came from the business loan segment, which grew 5.4% y-o-y in january, compared with 5% last december. household loans, on the other hand, eased slightly to 5.2% y-o-y from 5.3%. meanwhile, asset quality stabilised at around 1.2% at end-january and loan loss ratio improved marginally to 91.5%, compared with 90.2% last december. however, it may be too soon for cheer as leading indicators like loan applications and approvals contracted 8.4% and 5.1% y-o-y respectively in january. kenanga research opines that the momentum of industry loan growth will likely be subdued this year as banks will continue to be selective about asset quality and strict on approvals. stiff price-based competition may trend upwards this year as the contest for deposits intensifies for excess and longer-term funding. however, better pricing for assets may minimise nim compression. our base-case estimate for the system loan growth for 2017 is between 5% and 5.5%, says the research house. manulifes tock says the upcoming implementation of frs 9 (financial reporting standard 9) by banks is a concern. one of the nagging concerns for the banking sector is the frs 9, which kicks in on jan 1, 2018. frs requires banks to make appropriate provisions in anticipation of potential losses, rather than the current practice of making provisions only when losses are incurred. hence, we expect provisioning to, more likely than not, rise in order to ensure compliance, she says.  defensive banks the way to go the various challenges in the banking sector explain why many are cautious on banking stocks. tock says her strategy remains skewed towards banks with defensive attributes or those that have been restructured recently or have streamlined their operations. ta securities chief investment officer choo swee kee, who is also conservative on banks, says he prefers malayan banking bhd (maybank) because of its good dividend payout, besides the fact that its share price has fallen from its high of above rm10 apiece in 2014. maybanks full-year dividend per share totalled 52 sen in fy2016, giving the stock a yield of close to 6%, based on last fridays share price of rm8.73. its full-year net profit was, however, affected by larger net impairment losses, declining 1% to rm6.74 billion. but net interest income grew to rm11.57 billion from rm11.11 billion a year ago. net impairment losses increased 50% to rm3.02 billion from rm2.01 billion previously. choo says, people view banks as the barometer of a countrys economy. so, if an investor is looking for growth that is in line with the countrys economic growth, he may just have to keep a close eye on the banking sector. so, the question to ask is: what is the outlook for the countrys economy? malaysias economic growth, based on consensus, is between 4% and 4.5%. it is decent growth compared with that of the rest of the world. dbs vickers securities says in a report that the banking sectors valuation has risen marginally so far this year, pricing in the slightly better prospects for the sector. we believe a sustainable rerating will continue to hinge on the dissipation of uncertainties over asset quality, loan growth and net interest margins, it says. the research house still prefers defensive stocks like public bank bhd and hong leong bank, but has given buy calls to more counters, including bimb holdings bhd and ammb. bimbs upgrade is premised on its superior growth and solid fundamentals while we are more positive on ammb for its potential turnaround, it explains. given that the majority of research houses remain neutral on the sector, most bank stocks could trade sideways unless major surprises arise.

strong earnings reports from wal-mart and home depot. that followed a strong showing in european equities, which were boosted by upbeat german and french factory activity data, with germany's dax rising to its highest in nearly two years. the euro, however, has not followed suit as the currency markets focused more on potential political turbulence in the euro zone. the common currency was up a modest 0.1% at us$1.0544 after losing more than 0.7% the previous day. polls suggesting improving support for far-right french presidential candidate marine le pen have undermined sentiment and

to impose trade barriers on mexico and hit by the prospect of higher us rates, the peso weakened to a record low of roughly 22 per us dollar in january. \"this is the most important change in the

"malaysia will be hit if china faces recession", "article": "  kuala lumpur: while chinas macro cyclical movements affect the global economy as a whole, economists say asian nations like malaysia are expected to be more badly hit if china undergoes a recession. malaysias vulnerability is evident as shown in a sensitivity analysis by maybank investment bank bhd where a one-percentage-point (ppt) drop in chinas gross domestic product (gdp) growth would knock 0.7ppt off malaysias gdp growth. the international monetary fund (imf)s estimates deem china as important or the second-most important economy in terms of size in the world, said oxford university economics fellow linda yueh. if china were to have a recession or economic slowdown, there would be a bigger impact on asia, which is more integrated with china, yueh said when speaking to the edge financial daily during the recent invest asean organised by malayan banking bhd (maybank) and maybank kim eng holdings ltd. china is malaysias biggest trading partner, accounting for rm240.9 billion of the countrys overall trade of rm1.49 trillion in 2016. in comparison, malaysias trade with the second-placed us totalled rm135.9 billion for the same year. yueh, who is also adjunct professor of economics at london business school and a visiting professor of economics at peking university, said that based on the share of regional exports that go to china, a slowdown could affect about 2% of gdp in the region. noting that a lot of trade happens under the world trade organizations most-favoured-nation status, she said china still has a number of markets that could be opened up. so, if china pushes ahead with [the] rcep (regional comprehensive economic partnership, a proposed trade agreement between asean and china, japan, south korea, india, australia and new zealand), it would presumably help china open up its own markets on a reciprocal basis to some extent. and that would be very good not just for regional growth but also for global growth, but any chinese cyclical movements would get transmitted even without a free trade agreement. therefore, if china were to have a financial crisis, it would worsen the economic slowdown transmitted across the borders, said yueh. echoing yuehs observation, maybank investment bank chief economist suhaimi illias said the main conduit of maybanks sensitivity impact analysis is the trade channel, as china is malaysias largest trading partner, accounting for 16% of malaysias total trade in 2016. however, suhaimi said there are other factors besides trade to consider which can mitigate chinas slowdown, such as the rise in chinas investments in malaysia and recovery in tourist arrivals from china supporting the domestic economy via their spending. plus, at the moment, chinas economy has stabilised from the earlier growth slowdown, so this is more of an upside rather than a downside to [the] malaysian economy, he told the edge financial daily via email. apart from the growing malaysia-china trade, beijing also signed rm144 billion worth of investments in malaysia for infrastructure, property and manufacturing projects in 2016. suhaimi said chinas foreign direct investment (fdi) in malaysia had accumulated over the years, but was less than 1% of the total stock of fdi, based on international investment position data, of rm525.5 billion as of september 2016. of this tally of the total stock of fdi in malaysia, china is only rm5 billion or 0.9%, which pales in comparison with europes 31.6%, singapores 21.8%, japans 12.9% and the us 6.4% shares. these numbers reflect the fact that the eu (european union), singapore, japan and [the] us have been major sources of fdi in malaysia for a long time, whereas china has only begun to show up in recent years, he said. still, concerns have been expressed about the sudden influx of investments from china. yueh said it was not necessarily unusual for countries to be worried about chinese investment, citing similar situations in africa and australia, where there have been political concerns. i think there is always going to be [this concern], especially for malaysia, which has had an economic policy pretty directed to trying to ensure that it is in the region of [the] supply chain or whether local businesses are well represented and diverse in those sectors. all of those are actually things that the chinese are aware of when they moved some of their investments to southeast asia. they are not going to be unfamiliar with them. they are smart investors. [but] where malaysia has an advantage is that it is part of an integral economy in asean and in the asean economic community (aec) and i think from that perspective, it is part of the regional supply chain, she added. while asean as a bloc would be similar to the eu  increasingly driven by political integration  it would stop short of a single currency as there would be a need for institutions to support that currency. in the eu, the european central bank, the european stability mechanism (the imf for europe) and the banking unions single supervisory mechanism and single resolution mechanism were established in succession to monitor and supervise the fiscal and monetary markets. [but] i dont see the aec headed that way. i think the aec will probably head the way of a single market [and] stop short of [a] single currency.

announced that it would cut distributions per unit by 20% for fy17 as operating expenses for its main mobile business continue to climb. ocbc investment researchs analysts eugene chua and low pei han downgraded the stock to a sell with a fair value of s$2.65. the pair noted that starhubs 4qfy16 revenue had risen 0.2% to s$634.8 million due to higher service revenue, but operating expenses rose faster at 2.7% to s$570.7 million. coupled with lower income grants and higher handset subsidies, quarterly earnings fell 33.2% to s$54 million. for the full year, revenue fell 1.9% to s$2.4 billion, on lower mobile revenue, and full year earnings fell 8.3% to s$341.4 million. in our view, the operating environment is set to intensify with tpg entering as the 4th telco in a saturated singapore market, and we forecast for declining mobile revenue to persist, said chua and low in a note on monday. the real issue appears to be starhubs guidance for the coming years, says maybank kim engs analyst gregory yap. while revenue is expected to remain stable in fy17, its costs are expected to be structurally higher, particularly in areas relating to staff costs as the telco plans to invest further on its customer service differentiation, and content costs owing to the strong us dollar. we have highlighted usd cost of content as a risk before, said yap in a note on monday, adding that the two areas would contribute expenses amounting to 30% of revenue, in contrast to the capital expenditure that will amount to 13% of revenue. another major hurdle for the telco could come from tpg telecoms earlier-than-expected entry into the market. starhubs management told analysts that tpg would only enter the mobile market in 2018, but could enter the market earlier in areas like broadband. we believe part of managements motivation to invest heavily in service and content differentiation this year, even to the extent of reducing dividends, is related to this potential threat, explained yap, who added that tpgs intentions, would be known if it participated in the general spectrum auction to be held in march. maybank kim eng has downgraded the stock to a sell with a lower target price of s$2.49 from s$3.52 previously. with starhubs cautious guidance and its 20% cut in dpu to 4 singapore cents for fy17, ubs analysts are now anticipating a de-rating of its shares as investor worry about its dividend sustainability. the brokerage cut starhubs earnings forecast by 12% to 15% over the next two years and maintained its sell rating on the local telco with a lowered target price from s$3 to s$2.50. in fact, starhub is about to face a test of the efficacy of its hubbing strategy, according to rhb researchs singapore research team. as rhb explains it, more than 60% of starhubs service revenue comes from its mobile and broadband businesses which would face potential competition from tpg. we think the downside risk to earnings should be mitigated by the ability to bundle its mobile service with pay-tv and fixed broadband  which helps in customer retention, said the brokerage. morgan stanleys analysts mark goodridge and alvin lim further highlighted that starhub had not furbished additional details on its network sharing deal with m1 and is maintaining their underweight rating on the stock with a lower target price from s$2.60 to s$2.40. our view is that network sharing will have no near-term savings impact from opex or capex, said the pair. they point out that both telcos have 100% coverage in singapore and would enjoy little in coverage extension savings. they would also not be able to share the utility of a new spectrum, as the next new spectrum band to be made available  700 mhz  does not yet have a definitive timeline for its availability. 5g, the new technology upgrade, should be a genuine saving for m1 u2013 but it is a 2020 story. hence, capex will mostly be deployed in 2019 onwards, said goodridge and lim. to be sure, a bright spot remains for starhub in its enterprise fixed broadband business. as the second largest revenue contributor after the mobile business, with comparable margins, rhb believes the segment could help to mitigate the pressure on overall earnings. in fact, the segments revenue grew by 3.9% in fy16, and is expected to continue growing by 8.3% over the next three years, on the back of increased demand for smart services and the internet of things, data analytics, cloud and cyber security solutions, said rhb in a note on monday. shares in starhub are trading 19 singapore cents lower at s$2.81 on monday."},

coming years. however, their positivity was not reflected in bumi armadas share price in 2016. bumi armada shares fell 40.6% to 61 sen on dec 30, 2016 from rm1.02 on jan 4, 2016. uob kay hian analyst kong ho meng wrote in a jan 27, 2017 note on bumi armada that long-term investors should look beyond the weak 2016, as the groups four floating projects would provide long-term cash flow visibility. for the nine months ended sept 30, 2016 (9mfy16), bumi armadas net loss widened to rm591.61 million from rm149.49 million a year ago due to a non-cash impairment charge for certain fpso and offshore marine services multipurpose construction vessels. revenue for 9mfy16 fell 24% to rm1.21 billion from rm1.59 billion a year ago, due to lower conversion activities from the eni 1506 and kraken fpso projects. \nskp resources bhd\nskp resources bhd was a top pick in 2016 due to its contract wins from uk-based dyson ltd, for the manufacturing of cordless vacuum cleaners. during the year, its share

limit lafarges earnings recovery. we cut our financial year ending dec 31, 2016 (fy16) to fy18 earnings per share (eps) by 62%/35%/16% and tp to rm4.55 (-26% based on the updated mean price-earnings ratio [per] of 26 times on 2017 eps [from 24 times]). valuation is demanding with the stock trading at one-year forward per of 39 times and dividend yield of 2.4% is also unattractive. based on our channel checks, cement asps remained depressed (without any uplift) in the fourth quarter of 2016 (4q16) as the industrys cement demand softened amid slower construction activity during the rainy season. additionally, considering the spike in spot coal price in 4q16 (+41% quarter-on-quarter [q-o-q], +87% year-on-year [y-o-y]) and since around 20% of lafarges yearly coal requirement is sourced from the spot market, we believe lafarges 4qfy16 earnings could be depressed (3qfy16: rm4 million net profit; nine months of fy16: rm43 million). though we think cement asps may have already bottomed at current level (any further drop in asps would see cement players in losses), any rise in asps would be capped by the capacity overhang. moreover, the higher coal cost (year to date 2017: +33% versus 2016s average; coal and other fuel account for 30% of lafarges total cost) limit earnings recovery for lafarge. we project malaysias cement plant utilisation to improve slightly to 54% in 2017

an annualised 4% in october 2016, to pick up rapidly in 2017 as key indicators point to muted earnings expansion in the sector. alliancedbs research said it expects 2017 loan growth to hit 5% at best, judging from the weak loan application and approval trends. we expect another year of benign loan traction in 2017 u2026 further cuts in the overnight policy rate next year may result in more net interest margin (nim) pressure than expected, [with] a base-case assumption of [a contraction of] 2bps (two basis points) year-on-year, it said in a note issued on dec 7. aminvestment bank, meanwhile, expects loans in the local banking industry to grow between 5% and 6% in 2017. this would be on the back of a targeted gross domestic product (gdp) growth of 4.5% next year, resulting in a loan to gdp multiplier of between 1.1 and 1.3 times, it said in a dec 16 note. this will be lower than the historical five-year average loan to gdp multiplier of close to two times. our 2017 loan growth expected range is similar to 2016, of which the latter is based on a gdp growth of 4.2%. nevertheless, for 2017, we expect the industry loan growth to fall closer to the lower end of the targeted range of 5 to 6%, the firm said in the note. aminvestment added that the nim of banks is still expected to contract in 2017. a lower nim contraction of 5bps is anticipated in 2017, compared with 7bps in 2016. for 2017, we expect nim contraction for the sector to be driven largely by pressures of funding cost than asset yield, the firm said. a banking analyst from midf research said the firm is sanguine about prospects for the banking sector in 2017. we believe that with slightly better economic performance, we would see loan growth come in at [a] faster pace [in 2017] than this year (2016). we also expect that asset quality will continue to be stable, and we could see some banks doing more write-back from accounts which had been restructured and rescheduled this year (2016). this will improve profitability, he said. aminvestment noted that there will be continued expectations of pressure on asset quality in 2017. even though recent news of the organization of [the] petroleum exporting countries cutting oil production is likely to stabilise oil prices, we expect cautiousness on commodity and property sectors to remain. also, we expect closer monitoring to include trading and manufacturing sectors loans in cases where the weaker domestic currency has impacted margins and [where] borrowers are unable to pass on the increase in cost to their customers. on provisioning, we expect the sectors provisioning to still be elevated for 2017, but lower in levels compared with 2016. we expect the sectors average credit cost for 2017 to be 29bps, lower than 32bps in 2016, said the firm. as for return on equity (roe) for the sector, aminvestment said it expects roe to trend lower to 10.7% from 11% in 2016 and 11.9% in 2015. meanwhile, maybank ib research has factored in an uptick in non-performing loan ratios over the next two years. household asset quality is likely to see some mild deterioration amid higher living costs, and we are keeping a watchful eye still on oil and gas and non-residential property loan books. apart from isolated cases, the small and medium enterprise (sme) sector still looks robust with little sign of stress at this stage, but a slowdown in domestic consumption could have a knock-on effect, the firm said in its 2017 outlook and lookout note. maybanks top stock pick for the sector continues to be alliance financial group bhd for its strong sme niche, healthy loan loss coverage and adequate capital. the firm also favours bimb holdings bhd for exposure to a syariah financial group, strong fundamentals of bank islam malaysia bhd and earnings support from syarikat takaful malaysia bhd; and hong leong bank bhd for its prudent management, associate bank of chengdu co ltds earnings recovery and strong retail deposit franchise. alliancedbs picks for the banking sector are public bank bhd and hong leong bank. public bank remains resilient in this challenging operating environment, while hong leong bank has strong liquidity, apart from robust asset quality [and that] a better-than-expected recovery from its associate bank of chengdu could surprise on the upside, the firm said."}, "70": {"date_posted": "3/1/2017", "title": "the top gainers and losers on bursa in 2016", "article": "  kuala lumpur: the year that has come and gone has been described as nothing short of challenging, with local equities jostled by an all-round bumpy ride as uncertainties ruled. right from the very start, the benchmark index slumped 5.4% from the final day of 2015 to as low as 1,600.92 points on jan 21, 2016, fuelled by the continued fall in oil prices, before peaking three months later at 1,727.99 points in mid-april  up about 8%  only to fall near 6% before may. it saw a gradual rebound after that, to eventually settle at 1,641.73 last friday, still down 3% from a year ago, after an 11.31-point surge in the last hour. as in every situation, there are gainers and losers. a brief look at the top 10 best- and worst-performing stocks of the year showed that consumer stocks with resilient earnings and yields were favoured, while those who fell out of favour were a mixed bag  though weaker earnings and outlook were among the notable similarities, with downscaling of operations and change of owners also key determinants. heres a look at the top gainers and losers the year has seen on bursa malaysia  based on the biggest year-to-date changes in value  according to data culled from bloomberg:  top 5 gainers 1) dutch lady milk industries bhd shares in dutch lady milk industries bhd outperformed the fbm klci by surging as much as rm9.69 or 21.1% year-to-date settle at rm55.56 apiece on the last trading day of 2016 last friday. the dairy products maker has been benefiting from the subdued commodity prices in recent years, with gross margin on an increasing trend for seven consecutive quarters, beginning from the fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2014 (4qfy14) right up until 2qfy16. the stock surged by as much as rm16.92 or near 36% to its multiple-year high of rm64 on aug 15 last year from as low as rm47.08 on jan 21. however, the reversal of raw material prices that took place since 2qfy16 has eroded its gross profit margin, which caused the dairy product makers profit to shrink in the past two financial quarters. consequently, its share price has slipped by some 13.2% since the august peak, to its current level. nevertheless, dutch lady remained the star performer on bursa malaysia, as investors viewed it as one of the best defensive stocks to stash their money amid the volatile economic background. in its cumulative nine months ended sept 30, 2016, dutch ladys net profit dipped 3.9% to rm111.25 million from rm115.76 million a year ago, though revenue rose 6.2% to rm776.06 million from rm730.76 million. at its current price, dutch lady is trading at a trailing 12-month price-earnings ratio of 25.98 times with a dividend yield of 3.97%.  2) nestle (m) bhd food manufacturer nestle (m) bhds share price, which has been on an upward trajectory since jan 27 when it was trading at rm73.10, rose by as much as rm7.50 or 10.3% to a high of rm80.60 on sept 7, before paring some gains to settle at rm78.20 last friday. on a year-to-date basis, the stock was up rm7.34 or 10.4%, making it the second-best performer on the local bourse. based on the latest closing price  which valued the group at rm18.34 billion  nestles trailing 12-month dividend yield was at 3.47%. it was trading at 27.23 times to its price-to-book value. in october, nestle announced it had joined hands with online retailers lazada and 11street to launch its wellness e-stores on both their online shopping platforms, and that it was targeting to reap rm500 million in sales from its maiden venture into the e-commerce business. nestle managing director alois hofbauer reportedly said the group was confident in the viability of the e-commerce venture, but declined to provide an exact timeline on when the group plans to achieve its sales target. its really hard to say as we established our e-commerce business early this year, and the contribution from this is still small  about 1% or less. but let me be clear: a major part of our business will still be [transacted] through retailers, convenience stores and hypermarkets, so this e-commerce service will be complementary, hofbauer was quoted as saying at the time.  3) panasonic manufacturing malaysia bhd investors tend to park their money in defensive stocks when uncertainties mount, which could partially explain why panasonic manufacturing malaysia bhds share price has remained resilient, despite weak consumer sentiments. typically a dividend stock, panasonic has been rewarding investors with fat payouts over the past three financial years: 69 sen in the financial year ended march 31, 2014 (fy14), rm1.42 in fy15 and rm1.39 in fy16. based on the latest payout, the stocks dividend yield stood at 4.56%. for the second quarter ended sept 30, 2016, panasonics net profit fell near 24% to rm30.78 million from rm40.3 million a year earlier, due to higher operating expenses and lower share of profits from an associated company. revenue was 4.2% higher at rm292.42 million versus rm280.67 million a year earlier, driven by stronger sales in domestic and export markets for fan products. for the cumulative six months ended sept 30, 2016, its net profit slipped 4.2% to rm69.09 million from rm72.09 million, while revenue gained 7.7% to rm590.21 million from rm547.87 million. according to its annual report 2016, panasonic said the international economic and financial landscape is likely to remain challenging and will likely influence the prospects of the malaysian economy. nevertheless, the company will continue to focus on developing new products for its strategic products whilst leveraging on its operational efficiency to reduce and minimise overall costs of production, it said, adding it remains cautiously optimistic, in line with the gradual recovery of global economies.  4) fraser & neave holdings bhd the phenomenon of weakening consumer sentiment, a term which has been repeated ad nauseam over the past two years, seems to have had little effect on fraser & neave holdings bhds (f&n malaysia) earnings and the beverage maker continued to record strong profit growth for the financial year ended sept 30, 2016 (fy16). its annual net profit grew 37.6% to rm385.37 million from rm280.07 million a year ago, while revenue inched up 1.5% to rm4.17 billion versus rm4.11 billion, underpinned by its thailand operation. during a media briefing in november, f&n malaysia chief executive officer lim yew hoe said that the group was in talks with mcdonalds malaysia to supply its isotonic drink to the latters outlets here, confirming an august report by the edge financial daily that the beverage maker was courting the fast-food chain with 100plus. lim said mcdonalds has done a trial run by offering the drink at some of its outlets, but nothing has been finalised at the moment. what i can tell you is, for the time being, we are still [in talks] with mcdonalds. once we have [a decision], we will make an announcement, he told reporters at the time. earlier in july, in an interview with the edge weekly, lim said he did not want f&n malaysia to be involved in just isotonic drinks and dairy products but also food and beverage (f&b). for malaysia, i am talking about non-beverage and dairy, such as food [snacks]. we are an f&b company but food is not in our stable yet, he said.  5) ajinomoto (m) bhd shares in ajinomoto (m) bhd gained rm5.25 or 60.8% to end the last trading day of 2016 at rm13.88, which gave it a market value of rm843.88 million. in august, the monosodium glutamate manufacturer said it had accepted the offer from japans taisei lamic co ltd to sell its entire stake of 5% in malaysia packaging industry bhd (maypak) at rm1.37 million or 65 sen per share. following the disposal, it ceased to be a shareholder of maypak. in a media briefing in november, the group said it was targeting a double-digit operating profit growth for the financial year ending march 31, 2017, which it believed would be achievable with the support of more effective production and continued sales promotion activities. according to its managing director and chief executive officer keiji kaneko, the groups products such as aji-no-moto flavour enhancer, tumix flavour seasoning, seri-aji menu seasoning and pal sweet sweetener have garnered over 80% share of the local market. the group, he said, is also looking to expand its export market to other regions such as northern africa in the next three years. apart from that, the group will embark on its open new sky strategy in 2017 to introduce products under four new categories, namely new food culture, health, nutrition and functional benefits. we expect total sales from these new categories to reach rm50 million by 2020, he said. ajinomoto is currently trading at 1.11 times its price-to-book value and 19.76 times its price-earnings ratio.  top 5 losers 1) british american tobacco (m) bhd british american tobacco (m) bhds (bat) share price declined rm9 or 16.8% in 2016 to rm44.60, making it the years top loser on the local bourse. the local tobacco industry had to contend with three rounds of excise duty hikes between 2013 and 2016. tobacco tax rose 14% in september 2013, 12% in november 2014 and 36% in november 2015. the excise duty hikes are believed to have led to a steep decline in sales of legal cigarettes. in march 2016, bat  the only listed tobacco company in malaysia  decided to shut down its plant in malaysia, citing the high excise environment, which ultimately led to a sharp rise in sales of illegal cigarettes and significantly lower legal sales volumes, and also resulted in rising cigarette production costs. bat posted a 17% drop in net profit for the third quarter ended sept 30, 2016 to rm212.62 million from rm256.1 million a year ago. revenue declined 19.6% to rm932.19 million from rm1.16 billion. for the nine months ended sept 30, 2016 (9mfy16), net profit fell 39.6% to rm432.95 million from rm717.18 million in 9mfy15 due to overall volume reduction and escalating cost pressures. revenue fell 17% to rm2.92 billion from rm3.52 billion. moving into 2017, analysts are still cautious about the outlook on the tobacco industry. the sector landscape is getting increasingly difficult due to the declining cigarette consumption per capita as the population becomes more health conscious, continued high illicit trades and regulatory risks. the stock currently trades at a trailing 12-month price-earnings ratio of 19.6 times and has a trailing 12-month dividend yield of 5.42%.  2)umw holdings bhd it was definitely not a good year for umw holdings bhd as it was hard hit by a double whammy  soft auto sales and the downturn in the oil & gas (o&g) sector. over 2016, its share price came down by rm3.18 or 41.1% to rm4.57, giving it a market capitalisation of rm5.34 billion. the fall in share price was in line with the groups weak financial performance. it reported a net loss of rm128.83 million for the third quarter ended sept 30,2016, compared to a net profit of rm13.52 million a year ago, mainly dragged by its o&g division, which was facing a challenging economic environment and a weaker ringgit. revenue fell 19% to rm2.86 billion from rm3.53 billion. the group is expecting added pressure for asset impairment in the final quarter that may adversely impact its performance for the year. for the nine months ended sept 30, 2016 (9mfy16), the group made a net loss of rm124.38 million, versus a net profit of rm247.12 million for 9mfy15. revenue shrank 23% to rm7.9 billion from rm10.26 billion. affinhwang capital research has maintained its sell rating on umw with a target price of rm4.23 and said it does not see any positive catalyst to upgrade the stock, given the intensified competition within the automotive segment, the poor consumer spending and impact of weaker ringgit. the o&g business is expected to face delays in recovery, said the research house. while business outlook could remain challenging in the near term, affinhwang said if the plan to develop the groups serendah land proceeds, it could potentially be a good growth story and unlock value for investors.  3)shell refining co (federation of malaya) bhd shell refining co (federation of malaya) bhds (src) share price dropped by over 59% or rm2.94 to rm2.03 in 2016, giving it a market capitalisation of rm609 million. src is mainly involved in refining and manufacturing petroleum products such as liquefied petroleum gas, propylene, petrol, jet fuel, diesel and sulphur. the company recently saw changes in its board of directors and top management, following the completion of the sale of shell overseas holdings ltds 51% stake in src to malaysia hengyuan international ltd (mhil). chinese national wang youde was named non-independent and non-executive chairman of src. wang, 53, is the chairman and general manager of shandong hengyuan petrochemical, which owns mhil. concurrently, martinus joseph marinus aloysius stals, 50, replaced amir hamzah abu bakar as srcs managing director. two other chinese nationals, sun jianyun and wang zongquan, have also been appointed as non-independent and non-executive directors. mhil acquired the 51% stake in src on dec 19 for us$66.3 million (rm293.76 million). it subsequently launched an unconditional mandatory offer to acquire the remaining 49% stake at the same price of rm1.92 a share. src said it will remain a refinery and mhil will invest in upgrades to meet the locally mandated euro 4m and euro 5 requirements. src also said it will maintain supply to its retail and commercial customers and will honour all current commercial arrangements through existing comprehensive supply agreements in the country. as at dec 28, the employees provident fund had a direct stake of 6.027% in src. the fund has been trimming its stake in the company since the end of 2012. the stock currently trades at a trailing 12-month price-earnings ratio of 2.79 times and is at 0.76 times its book value.  4) globetronics technology bhd semiconductor player globetronics technology bhds share price fell rm2.67 or 43.4% to rm3.48 in 2016. this reduced its market capitalisation to rm980.99 million, leading to the company exiting the billion ringgit club. globetronics net profit dropped 55.3% to rm9.15 million for the third quarter ended sept 30, 2016 (3qfy16) from rm20.49 million in 3qfy15, as it saw lower year-on-year (y-o-y) sales and recognised a foreign exchange loss. revenue fell 40.9% to rm52.46 million from rm88.71 million. the group said sales from both its malaysia and singapore segments were lower y-o-y. for the cumulative nine months to sept 30, 2016 (9mfy16), net profit plunged 65.18% to rm19.35 million from rm55.57 million in 9mfy15. revenue fell 36.7% to rm168.61 million from rm266.43 million. affinhwang capital, which has a buy call on globetronics with a target price of rm4.88, has learned that the companys new light sensor, which is still going through the qualification process, is on track and increasingly likely to be designed into the final product. on the flip side, the research house said in a note dated dec 22 that the volumes for the proximity sensors have continued to shrink to two to three million units in december (from eight to nine million per month). affinhwang capital remained optimistic that the new sensors will more than compensate for any slowdown in existing operations.  5) kossan rubber industries bhd glove maker kossan rubber industries bhds stellar share price performance in 2015, which saw the counter surge more than 100%, did not extend to 2016. kossans share price started to decline since the beginning of the year. over 2016, it fell rm2.55 or 27.9% to rm6.59. kossans net profit fell 38.3% to rm34.02 million for the third quarter ended sept 30, 2016 from rm55.17 million a year earlier, as the glove industry faced selling price pressure and higher production costs. revenue was down 6.3% to rm414.04 million from rm441.74 million. for the cumulative nine months ended sept 30, 2016 (9mfy16), kossans net profit slipped 14.7% to rm126.3 million from rm148.06 million in 9mfy15. revenue grew 2.5% to rm1.23 billion from rm1.2 billion. in its strategy note dated dec 19, maybank investment bank research noted that the share prices of glove players have fallen by 20% to 30% in 2016, underperforming the fbm klci as the supernormal earnings dissipated on lower average selling prices, a result of the passing through of the stronger us dollar against the ringgit and intense nitrile competition. the research house said while the high raw material prices may persist into 2017, earnings growth momentum could sustain in the first half of 2017 for the glove industry, due to the cost pass-through mechanism and the presently high us dollar against the ringgit. however, it noted that the overexpansion and intense average selling price competition could recur in the second half of 2017, leading to compression of margins or earnings again. the research house has upgraded the glove sector to neutral and has a hold call on kossan with a target price of rm6.35."}, "71": {"date_posted": "22/12/2016", "title": "klci remains in negative zone in tandem with region", "article": " kuala

[we will] offer either an mss (mutual separation scheme) or vss (voluntary separation scheme), he says, reiterating that the company will be fair to its staff. according to fgvs fy2015 annual report, the company had 18,696 employees. however, the number of staff who will be let go is unlikely to be significant, says zakaria. the coming year will be better, after the kitchen-sinking exercise. this year, we have done a lot. in terms of the core business, we are okay, but some things were off my radar [screen]. im going to look at all our jvs (joint ventures). if there are no returns, we will review them, he explains. in a report released last week, maybank investment bank says, fgv posted a 3qfy2016 headline loss of rm95 million versus a headline profit of rm62 million in 2q2016. stripping out land lease liability adjustment and rm57 million in stock write-down at its jointly-controlled entity in turkey on fraudulent accounting, its 3q2016 core loss was rm37 million (rm158 million in 3q2015, and rm10 million in 2q2016). this brings 9mfy2016 core net loss to rm113 million (-40% y-o-y), significantly below our/ consensus full-year profit forecasts. maybank has a target price of rm1.78 and a hold call on fgv. during an interview with the edge at end-july, zakaria said, in our experience, from our plantations, we gauge that the worst is over. he explains that, our performance, if based on the normal [course of] business, should have seen an improvement. based on assumptions, i had not anticipated the severity of el niu00f1o. i didnt know how bad it would be. el niu00f1o generally refers to the prolonged warming of the pacific oceans sea-surface temperature, resulting in the ocean nino index rising above the 0.5 threshold for five consecutive months. strong el niu00f1o effects bring dry spells to southeast asian countries, among others, and impact malaysia, indonesia and thailand, which collectively control 90% of the worlds crude palm oil production. i

"}, "76": {"date_posted": "1/12/2016", "title": "cover story: weathering the storm with reits", "article": "  the heightened market volatility does not show signs of easing anytime soon. industry players are recommending real estate investment trusts as they offer stable and consistent returns. \ndonald trumps shocking win in the recent us presidential election heightened volatility in financial markets around the world. the uncertainties surrounding the president-elects policies, especially his stance on protectionism and free trade, are widely expected to prolong market volatility if they are implemented. an analyst with a local investment bank says while the current market volatility may be a knee-jerk reaction to the election results, an economic slowdown may take place if the situation persists. this may cause stock prices in general to remain low for a long period of time and turn the spotlight on malaysian real estate investment trusts (m-reits). in the midst of the turbulence, this asset class is expected to continue providing consistent returns and offer some stability to investors. when all the other sectors are down, reits will not go down as much because they are not a high beta sector. when times are bad, people will look at reits, says the analyst. local reits will still offer yields of 5.5% to 6%, which provides stability to investors portfolios. it is always a safe-haven sector in volatile times.  a case in point, the fbm klci tumbled to a three-month low of 1,647.62 points on nov 9, down 0.97% or 16.2 points from the previous days close. but reits held steady, with the tr/gpr/aprea composite reit index malaysia only falling 0.19% or 0.59 points to 302.7033. unless bank negara malaysia decides to change its monetary policy, trumps presidency will not have a direct impact on the m-reit sector, says another market analyst. people are perceiving more uncertainty under trumps presidency and this uncertainty will lead people to look at reits. people started turning to reits after the last overnight policy rate (opr) cut. so, i believe they already have a strong position in the asset class. an investment analyst that covers m-reits says an economic slowdown caused by trumps policies and plans could prompt bank negara to cut the opr further in an effort to stimulate the local economy. on july 13, the central bank unexpectedly lowered its key interest rate to 3%  its first cut since 2009. the move was in response to the increasing downside risks on the external front amid the low inflationary environment. if the opr is cut to stimulate the local economy, it could help reduce the monthly loan payments to the banks, says gavin teoh, advisory and practice director at standard financial adviser sdn bhd. this will eventually increase the attractiveness of m-reits and fixed-income assets, such as bonds, which typically move in an inverse direction to interest rates. but the previous situation of expecting interest rate hikes by the us federal reserve did affect the interest rates of other countries, and this has impacted reits. at the moment, many find it hard to predict trumps economic agenda and the feds next monetary policy move, says teoh. despite the market volatility, the fed is expected to raise interest rates sometime next year. according to rabobank financial markets researchs nov 11 report, prior to the us presidential election, there were concerns that a trump victory could result in uncertainty and cause the central bank to delay its planned rate hike in december. however, this concern has clearly evaporated despite the heightened volatility, says rabobank. markets around the world have rallied. furthermore, the recent us jobless claims came in better than expected, so the labour market is still going strong. this makes trump  or, better, potential market volatility in the wake of his election  the only factor that could prevent a fed hike in december, says the report.  it appears that the focus has shifted from december 2016 to 2017 as the markets implied pace of the feds tightening cycle has increased on the back of higher inflation expectations, it adds. independent financial planner k gunasegaran, who is also founder and managing director of wealth street sdn bhd, says investors who are looking to preserve their wealth in the face of uncertainty and volatility in the equity markets should look at increasing their allocation to reits. if they are holding, say, 10% to 15% of their portfolio in the asset class, then they should increase it to about 30% as reits give consistent payouts and are a good defensive asset class in volatile times. reits are something investors should look at to mitigate risks when there is a financial storm, he adds. aw choon hui, deputy ceo of gyc financial advisory pte ltd in singapore, has been a strong proponent of reits. the company collaborated with henderson global investors to launch a fund of global reits in 2013 and also keep a reit and infrastructure allocation in their clients portfolios. in our portfolio construction, we always include some component of listed properties, whether in the form of listed reits or infrastructure assets. it helps to diversify and bring down the overall risk of a typical equity and fixed-income portfolio, says aw. global reits provide fairly decent long run 3% to 4% yields, with slow and steady capital gains. the good reits are yield accretive and can definitely benefit investors portfolios when held for the long term. although some investors dislike the equity behaviour and market noise that reits are subject to (being listed securities), in the long run, they are still subject to the supply and demand vagaries of the property market, economic and interest rate cycles just like hard property assets.  local reits m-reits have outperformed the fbm klci substantially over the last five years. from january 2012 to oct 31 this year, they have given an average total return of 50.6% and an average dividend yield of 6.4%, according to bloomberg. by comparison, the fbm klcis dividend yield as at nov 15 was only 3.13%. analysts attribute the good performance of local reits in the last 12 months to recent and ongoing events, such as the opr cut by bank negara, fallout from the brexit referendum in the uk, global low-yield environment and uncertainties in the global economy. malaysian reit managers association (mrma) chairman datuk jeffrey ng says m-reits have gained substantial traction among local investors over the last decade as a large portion of the free floats in local reits are invested by domestic retail and institutional investors. typically, foreign unit holdings of m-reits do not make up more than 20% of the units in circulation. therefore, at least 80% of the units are held by malaysian investors (including the sponsors). he adds that m-reits are highly sought after by long-term sovereign wealth funds and insurance funds that view the asset class as a yield-generating investment. following an appreciation in unit prices over the last several months, the distribution yield between m-reits and the 10-year malaysian government securities (mgs) has compressed to 239 basis points (bps) as at oct 31. despite the narrower yield spread, ng says there is still a yield uplift for reits compared with the 10-year mgs and fixed deposit (fd) rates. m-reits were introduced in 2005 and axis reit was the first in the sector to be listed on bursa malaysia. at the time, the market capitalisation of the reits was only rm356 million. today, with 17 listed reits, their market capitalisation stands at rm43 billion (as at oct 31). there is a wide range of m-reits available, from conventional and islamic trusts to specialised and diversified ones. specialised reits focus on income-generating assets in specific sub-sectors such as retail malls, offices, industrial properties and hospitality venues while diversified reits own a diverse portfolio of income-generating assets across several property sub-sectors. reits that specialise in offices include mrcb-quill reit and tower reit. igb reit specialises in retail properties, al-aqar healthcare reit specialises in healthcare facilities and ytl hospitality reit specialises in hospitality venues. sunway reit, capitaland malaysia mall reit and amanahraya reit are diversified reits that focus on either retail, office or industrial properties. ng says there is room for the sector to grow further and play a more prominent role in the capital market. compared with our neighbour, singapore, the 39 reits there have a total market capitalisation of s$66 billion  four times that of m-reits. the financial fundamentals of m-reits are expected to improve, he adds, be it at a slower pace as rental reversions are expected to grow at a slower pace in the current landscape. additionally, the property market oversupply situation and macro-economic uncertainties are expected to further dampen the reits operating environment. based on the prevailing unit prices of m-reits at compressed distribution yields, we are of the view that market prices have rallied ahead of the reits fundamentals, supported by the favourable low interest rate regime and uncertainties in the equity market. however, we caution investors to be mindful of the fundamental factors, such as the outlook for the various property sub-sectors, valuation of the units, management quality and track record of the reits, says ng. despite a potential opr cut creating good opportunities for investors, there are challenges facing m-reits. for one, they are facing a long-term threat of oversupply of office spaces, says hong leong investment bank analyst lee meng horng. some of the office properties are not doing well in terms of occupancy rates. there are a lot of leases for big projects coming up, such as the bukit bintang city centre (bbcc), tun razak exchanges (trx) bandar malaysia and sunway velocity, he says. the office sector will certainly be less favourable in the coming years. while the retail sector is still relatively stable, i think the industrial sector will be the one people will be moving into due to the securities commission malaysias liberalisation. the sector will be the top beneficiary and we do not see a supply and demand mismatch in terms of industrial space. according to maybank investment banks aug 9 research report, among the m-reits with significant office vacancies at the moment are sunway reit and axis reit. the sunway tower and sunway putra tower, whose occupancy rates at end-march stood at 19% and 27% respectively, are still looking for tenants. other notable assets with occupancy rates below 80% are infinite centre, axis business park, axis vista and axis eureka. in the longer term, e-commerce may pose a strong threat to the retail sector, says lee. we cannot discount the threat to retail malls. it may take a long time, but the possibility is evident as seen in chinas retail space. it is not impossible that the same thing could happen in malaysia. he adds that m-reits are also seeing a slower rental reversion than a few years ago, which may be attributed to slower consumer spending post-gst implementation. however, we have seen a slight pickup in the past one or two quarters on consumer spending and sentiment. while retail reits have been traditionally viewed as a safe haven, lee says this is only for prime malls at great locations, near full occupancy rate and highly rated leases, such as igb reits mid valley megamall. midf research analyst jessica low concurs, saying that retail reits with solid assets in prime locations can be viewed as safe-haven investments. besides igb reits mid valley megamall and the gardens mall, other malls that meet the criteria are klccp stapled groups suria klcc, pavilion reits pavilion kuala lumpur and sunway reits sunway pyramid. the performance of the mentioned assets is expected to stay firm going forward due to the high footfall and occupancy rates. thus, the rental reversions for the malls are expected to be remain in positive territory, says lee. what should investors look for when choosing an m-reit? lee says the most important thing to look at is its sustainability. we value reits based on yield and when we look at the yield, we look at sustainability  whether the dividend will be sustainable over the next two years. we are not so concerned about organic or inorganic growth. growth is something extra. it must be sustainable first, he adds, citing mrcb-quill reit, pavilion reit and klcc reit as the top picks. low says investors should pick reits based on the quality of the assets (rental growth and location), the extent of their exposure in the retail and office sectors and their yield. currently, midf researchs top pick is sunway reit as the performance of its flagship sunway pyramid is expected to remain stable going forward while its office division should see a recovery from a low base.  opportunity in asia-pacific wealth streets gunasegaran says investors could look at asia-pacific reits as they provide more consistency and better prospects. singapore reits, for example, give better returns of about 6% to 9% and offer better consistency than m-reits. that is why most of the singapore retirees put a big chunk of their portfolio into reits. in malaysia, there are a few reit funds that focus on asia-pacific, such as the rhb asian real estate fund, manulife investment asia-pacific reit fund and amasia pacific reits plus, which mostly invest in real estate securities and listed reits in the region. amfund management bhds (aminvest) amasia pacific reits u2013 myr class fund invests in listed reits in asia-pacific, including australia, hong kong, japan, malaysia, new zealand, singapore, south korea, taiwan and thailand. it also diversifies its investments into reits that focus on different sub-sectors such as residential, commercial and industrial properties. aminvests equities fund manager selina yong says reits in the region will continue to be an attractive asset class, especially for investors looking for good dividend yields. if you look at the yield spreads [between reits and 10-year mgs] across the region, australia has been stable at 270bps, singapore is at 460bps and japan is at 340bps [prior to the us presidential election]. this means you still get a decent spread over the risk in those countries, she says. if investors are looking to benefit from the yield spreads, then increasing their allocation is something that could be considered. i think asia-pacific reits will continue to be an attractive asset class if you look past the near-term volatility moving up to the medium term. yong says although equity markets are very unpredictable, aminvest tries to look for growth in certain countries and certain property segments that outstrip inflation. this allows reit managers to gain a profit over the operational cost. the portfolio running yield currently ranges from 4.5% to 5%, and that changes slightly depending on market movements and cash levels. but it is lower than what it used to be at the fund inception, which was about 6%, she says. aminvest diversifies into reits with assets such as childcare, energy, healthcare, large-scale logistics and data centres. the fund had a return of 18.44% over one year, 46.09% over three years and 99.95% over five years as at sept 30. it is a leader in the lipper tables equity sector real estate asia-pacific non-islamic category. aminvests main markets are australia, japan and singapore as they are the largest and most liquid reit markets in asia. in australia, the fund focuses on the childcare segment, which has seen rising demand recently because the australian government provides families with young children a subsidy, among others. the thing about childcare centres is that they are a very fragmented asset class. transactions may not be as liquid as office, retail and industrial properties, but that is where we see opportunities for growth, says yong. we only have a couple of large institutional landlords, who have built up a scalable platform. and because they have balance sheet strength, they are able to grow the portfolios meaningfully, either through acquisitions or redevelopment of the sites. while the segment has put off other institutional investors due to the barriers to entry and stringent regulations, it has not deterred aminvest. institutional investors need to spend time on good working relationships with not only the childcare centre operators but also the local council. there is a lot more granularity in working these portfolios compared with an office portfolio, says yong. aminvests fund also has prime office holdings in sydney and melbourne. the offices are attractive because there is less new supply coming into the market and the occupancy rate stands at 96% (from 95% two years ago). in japan, aminvest is focusing on offices in five wards in tokyo, which also lacks new supply. yong says the vacancy rate was only about 3.7% at end-september, compared with 3.9% the previous month. there was a slight decline in rental spaces, which caused redevelopment to take off. as a result, rental rates have increased 4.2% year on year. in singapore, however, the economy is lacklustre, says yong. that is a function of its exposure to the global economy, which has inherently affected the demand for office, retail and industrial properties. it is unavoidable. the best that landlords can do is navigate the headwinds the best that they can. despite this, aminvest does have a penchant for singapore-listed reits that have assets abroad. the assets could be in india, australia, china, japan or even the us. these reits offer high yields as well as better growth prospects as opposed to those whose assets are purely located in singapore, says yong. singaporean data centres are an emerging sub-sector that aminvest is looking into. yong says the city state is an attractive location for data centres because it is in a natural disaster-free location, has a well-established network infrastructure and clear legal framework. the intensification of internet use is expected to create greater demand for these centres. while volatility is anticipated to rise in the near term, aminvest views the situation positively as it creates opportunities for the fund house to generate returns from its existing positions at far better valuations than three to six months ago or to establish a new position.   proposed guidelines  malaysian reits stand to offer stable and sustainable returns in the longer term because of the recently proposed liberalisation by the securities commission malaysia (sc). on july 14, the sc released a consultation paper seeking public feedback on the proposed enhancements to the guidelines on real estate investment trusts (reit guidelines), first introduced in 2005. among its proposals, the new guidelines will allow reits to acquire vacant land in addition to acquiring up to 15% of the total asset value of greenfield developments. this will give reits more room to develop their own property instead of acquiring more expensive, readily yield-accretive assets. the scs liberalisation will give reits more opportunity to acquire yield-accretive assets. asset prices have been really high, so it has been very tough for reits to acquire assets that are accretive to their portfolio. therefore, if they are able to develop greenfield projects, the yield will be generally higher and more stable, says a market analyst. however, it is subject to the construction cost, how the acquisition will be financed and a multitude of other factors. but it should be accretive in the longer term. if you invest in a reit that is looking to acquire greenfield assets, then you should give yourself a two to three-year time horizon for it to be distribution per unit accretive.   asia-pacifics first reit etf  singapore recently launched its first real estate investment trust (reit) exchange-traded fund (etf)  the phillip sgx apac dividend leaders reit etf  issued by phillip capital management ltd. touted as the first of its kind in the region, the reit etf tracks the sgx apac ex japan dividend leaders reit index, which comprises 30 reits across asia-pacific ex japan, ranked according to the total dividends paid out in the preceding 12 months (reits that paid out the most in

liquidity. its total return over the 12 months ended july 29 was 19.97%, or a yield of 4.53%. the reit etf provides investors with transparent and low-cost access to a diverse portfolio of quality reits, which offer sustainable dividend income. linus lim, director and co-chief investment officer at phillip capital, says it is the right time to introduce the etf to the market. there is also strong investor demand, whether from institutions looking for dependable income or individual investors, in our exploratory conversations prior to starting this. on top of that, the singapore exchange has been slowly growing its presence for reits in asia. so, i think it is an opportune time to build an etf out of reits, he says. he adds that the global etf industry has grown possibly 10 times in the last six to seven years in terms of passive fund management. i think there will be a similar growth pattern in asia. maybe not as fast, but it will grow steadily over time as people get more familiar with the concept of etfs. as etfs are still a new space in singapore and malaysia, lim says efforts have to be made to educate retail investors on this asset class. the first group of retail investors may not grasp much of the concept as there are not many etfs in these two markets, except for those that are cross-listing from offshore fund managers. it does not help that sophisticated investors who are investing on wall street have a tendency to compare the etfs there with our homegrown ones. they are not the same. therefore, we need to educate, or at least help to educate, retail investors. in terms of returns, lim is confident that the reit etfs dividend-weighted strategy will enhance risk-adjusted returns above the traditional market capitalisation-weighted strategies. the etf also aims to provide more diversification for investors in the reit sector, he says. each reit has a specific focus, such as industrial, retail or residential properties. any risks will come from the individual sectors themselves, says lim. the reit etf is diversified across various sectors as the methodology picks quality reits from the asia-pacific universe. therefore, the end product encompasses reits that hold high quality properties, have a large market cap, are liquid in the market and are able to pay out sustainable income compared with the rest of their peers. for the phillip sgx apac dividend leaders reit etf, there is a 0.5% management fee as well as index licensing, trustee and auditor fees, among others. the total expense ratio of the etf is capped at 0.65% of assets under management. lim says although some people say phillip capital should be charging less, it actually compares favourably with the smart beta etfs, which is what its reit etf is. it is not a simple synthetic replication, but a physical replication. and we are using a different methodology, so we have to set up our own index. not all etfs are the same. you cannot compare it with the us etfs as it has a much larger scale, which allows it to charge lower fees. if we compare ourselves with similar niche type of strategies  those that focus on asia or on a particular sector  then, our fees compare fairly with that space.   islamic m-reits  of the 17 listed reits in malaysia, only four are islamic or invest in shariah-compliant real estate and other assets  al-aqar healthcare reit, klcc real estate investment trust, axis real estate investment trust and al-salam investment trust. malaysian reit managers association (mrma) chairman datuk jeffrey ng says while there is growing demand for islamic m-reits, there are some practical challenges in the formation and management of these reits in the country. currently, islamic reits are allowed, at the point of establishment, to acquire real estate with tenants that carry out non-shariah-compliant activities, provided that the percentage of total rent is less than 20% of the islamic reits total turnover. however, the current requirement does not allow these reits to accept new tenants or renew existing tenants whose activities are totally non-shariah-compliant. this will hinder the operations and the growth of the islamic reits, he says. to encourage more islamic reits in the country, the securities commission malaysia is proposing a five-year time frame to reduce the non-shariah-compliant income to 5%, under its proposed guidelines. while the move is welcomed by mrma, ng says it hopes the sc will consider extending the period to 10 years to give islamic reits more time to manage their tenancy mix. the worlds largest shariah-compliant reit is the uae-based emirates reit. it is the first regulated shariah-compliant reit listed on nasdaq dubai. the company recently announced that an 18.3% valuation gain on the construction of its jebel ali school in damacs akoya development helped to increase its total assets to us$773.1 million as at end-september, effectively overtaking singapores sabana shariah compliant industrial reit, at us$762 million."}, "77": {"date_posted": "30/11/2016", "title": "media prima mulls unlocking land value ", "article": "  media prima bhd is looking at unlocking the value of its land parcels in ajil, terengganu and senai, johor, and one option it is considering is selling the tracts, industry sources say. in an email response to the edge, media prima says it is evaluating all available options and will decide what is best for the group in due course for the land in ajil and senai. media prima had undertaken a key restructuring exercise to optimise its print manufacturing operations. the restructuring involves closure of its manufacturing plants in ajil and senai. this strategic action allows media prima to unlock potential cost-savings while the group continues to invest in digital expansion activities and new business initiatives in line with the current shift in consumers preference for digital content, the media group notes. while changing consumer preference has impacted the sales of physical newspapers, the growing demand for online content has resulted in a significant increase in readership of nstps electronic versions of the new straits times, berita harian and harian u00admetro. therefore, the restructuring exercise will enable the group to fully utilise the capacity of its manufacturing facilities based on current newspaper circulation demands, it adds. the land in ajil and senai are worth quite a handsome sum. according to media primas fy2015 annual report, it has two pieces of leasehold land measuring 174,240 and 183,709 sq ft in senai with a net book value of rm3.89 million and rm17.57 million respectively. a 610,404 sq ft piece of leasehold land in ajil, terengganu, has a net book value of rm24.075 million. the pieces of land in ajil and senai are the top three and four most valuable properties, according to media primas annual report. the two parcels that have the highest values are a 655,000 sq ft freehold tract in bukit jelutong industrial park, selangor, that houses its regional printing plant, with a net book value of rm96.18 million, and the 70,586 sq ft freehold parcel in jalan liku, kuala lumpur, that houses media primas head office, with a net book value of rm49.1 million. media prima also has land parcels nationwide including penang, sabah and kelantan. it also owns a residential house and an apartment in london, uk. it is unclear when media prima last revalued the land parcels and properties it owns. the edge wrote in june 2015 that a number of media players are sitting on an unexpected source of income in their balance sheets  lucrative parcels of land that if unlocked, would result in capital gain and recurring income. these players include media prima which has seen the net book value of its leasehold land, freehold land and buildings grow 18.56% to rm281.973 million as at dec 31, 2015, compared with rm237.83 million a year ago. the landscape for media players has become grimmer over the years. as consumption for news shifts to the digital realm, the demand for printed newspapers has declined and the challenge of monetising news online remains huge. as such, media groups are actively diversifying in search of new sources of income. according to the audit bureau of circulations in malaysia, the total printed copies of paid newspapers have been going downward. from july to december 2015, the total circulation for paid newspapers dropped to 2.82 million from 3.197 million a year earlier. media primas publications  new straits times, berita harian and harian metro  were all affected by this downtrend. the three publications have a rich history. the roots of its english newspaper  news straits times  can be traced back to the straits times that started business in singapore in 1845. it is the oldest newspaper in town. berita harian hit the streets in 1957, the same year the country achieved its independence, while harian metro came into the scene in the 1980s. media prima has been diversifying or growing its non-print income base. for example, its non-print segments such as its out-of-home advertising business  big tree sdn bhd  and its radio businesses are the only two segments that saw y-o-y profit growth for the six months ended june 30. the radio business saw its gross revenue grow 14% year on year to rm39.4 million and its net profit expand 57% to rm11.3 million for the first half ended june 30. the business contributes 27% to media primas earnings. for fy2010, it contributed 9%. meanwhile, profit generated from the out-of-home advertising business expanded 7% y-o-y to rm14.4 million as at june 30, contributing 35% to the groups earnings, compared with barely 13% in fy2010. for fy2015, media prima received rm30 million of net dividends, including dividend receivables, from big tree  50% higher than the rm20 million in fy2014. the company started expanding its out-of- home advertising business in 2010 when it acquired kurnia outdoor sdn bhd. in september, mass rapid transit corporation bhd awarded big tree, which had entered into a consortium with seni jaya group, an advertising package for the mrt sungai buloh-kajang line. the package is for 10 years. the contract in which big tree has a 60% stake is estimated to generate up to rm300 million in revenue throughout the period. amresearch in a sept 30 report notes that it does not expect the consortium to have material impact on media primas group earnings, as it estimates it will merely contribute rm18 million in fy2017f revenue (1% of fy2017f group revenue) and rm4 million in fy2017f net profit (3% of fy2017f group net profit) based on its three-year historical average net margin of 23%. nevertheless, we are positive as we view this as being part of media primas continuing initiative to diversify earnings into higher margin businesses amid headwinds in its print and tv segments, it adds. maybank research investment bank in a nov 16 report says while the outlook for the print advertisement expenditure remains hazy, it will not be surprised if media prima takes steps to improve profitability. for instance, when fy14 print ebitda fell below rm100 million, it resorted to a mutual separation scheme that cost rm79.8 million but cut rm38 million per annum in staff expenses. the bulk of the savings appeared to be from print and this returned fy2015 print ebitda above rm100 million, it notes. for fy2015, media primas net profit rose 81% y-o-y to rm138.7 million, bolstered by cost rationalisation measures it undertook that year. it managed to stem the drop in its earnings that it saw in fy2014, when net profit fell 65% y-o-y to rm76.6 million. at its close of rm1.23 last friday, the stock was trading at an indicative 12-month yield of 8.54%.

as more tourists visit the hilltop casino resort. this is in sharp contrast to the downward trend of its sister company genting singapore ltds share price which hit 6u00bd years low of 64.74 singapore cents on feb 11. anticipating a rising number of visitors, gem will be adding more gaming tables and slot machines to cater for tourists from china and the return of singaporeans. the group is opening three floors for new gaming tables and slot machines in its new sky plaza, while its sky avenue  with nearly 600,000 sq ft of floor space  will have retail and international food and beverage brands, say industry sources. it is understood that the new projects will open in stages next month. when contacted, gem confirms the additional capacity but declines to furnish details. gaming analysts and industry observers believe the recent upward trend of the stock is driven by expectation of the new openings at the genting highlands resort  the key earnings contributor to parent company genting bhd. gems share price hit a record closing high of rm4.91 on oct 13. it then came off the peak to rm4.58 last friday. year to date, it has gained 11%. trading volumes on oct 13 ballooned to 9.4 million shares  129% higher than the one-year average trading volume of 4.1 million shares. the stock price has been rising partly due to the [imminent] opening of genting malaysias new projects. the gitp (genting integrated tourism plan) momentum is building up, says uob kay hians head of research vincent khoo, who tracks the gaming industry. maybank investment bank research in an oct 31 report notes that the share prices of macau and southeast asian gaming companies since 2009 had revealed an interesting trend  the prices rose before the opening of new properties. the only exceptions were galaxy macau 2, broadway macau and studio city. to be fair, macau gaming was in recession at the time, with 2015 macau ggr [gross gaming revenue] plunging 34% year on year. learning from history, we are confident that genting malaysia will appreciate in january 2017 once sky avenue and sky plaza open for business, it says. maybank investment bank recently raised its target price for gem by 19% to rm5.50. a gaming analyst at a local bank, who declined to be named, says there is a noticeable presence of visitors from china at the resort recently. maybank investment bank believes the rising number of chinese tourists to resorts world genting (rwg) may be just the beginning. it estimates that chinese tourists accounted for about 4% of genting highlands visitor arrivals of about 800,000 last year. the research house believes the numbers will grow rapidly. if the golden week (oct 1 to 7) figures are anything to go by, the y-o-y growth (of chinese visitors) appears to be accelerating. therefore, we deem it possible that the number of chinese visitors to the casino resort may breach the one-million mark this year. more importantly, they appear to be originating from the wealthier provinces of china, it states in the oct 31 report. meanwhile, uob kay hians khoo reveals that currently, about one in four chinese tourists visit genting highlands during their trips to malaysia, making up about 7% of the resorts total number of hotel guests. statistics on malaysia tourism promotion board website shows tourist arrivals from china have been rising since the start of the year. in the first two quarters of this year, tourist arrivals from china increased 35% y-o-y to 512,973 and 29% to 479,520 respectively. the ministry of tourism and culture expects the number of people travelling from china to malaysia to hit two million this year, and possibly reaching as high as four million. last year, 1.6 million people travelled from china to malaysia. earlier this year, malaysia waived the visa requirements for chinese tourists who stay less than 15 days in the country from march 1 to dec 31, 2016. chinese visitors who want to stay in the country for more than 15 days but fewer than 30 days will be issued e-visas within 24 hours. besides chinese tourists, singaporeans are also visiting genting highlands in increasing numbers. industry observers say this could be due to the weaker ringgit vis-u00e0-vis the singapore dollar. the singapore dollar has strengthened 18% to rm3.05 from two years ago. according to the ministry of tourism and culture, singapore visitors to malaysia rose 6% to 3.34 million in 2q2016 compared with the same period a year earlier. maybank investment bank raised its fy2018 to fy2019 estimated earnings of gem recently taking into account more visitor arrivals, rental income from sky avenue and sky plaza, and higher average spend per visitor at its 20th century fox world theme park, which is part of the gitp project. case in point, 12-month forward ev/ebitda surged from 4.5 times in september 2006 to 9.7 times in july 2007 after the 6,118-room first world hotel fully opened in december 2005. first world hotel boosted rwgs inventory by 150% and drove genting malaysias earnings to breach the rm1 billion mark in fy2007. in fact, we gather that the rerating would have been higher if the earnings of associate, genting hong kong ltd (then known as star cruises), had not deteriorated, it states in the report. uob kay hian research also has a buy call on the stock with a sum-of-parts-based target price of rm5.10. even though the current share price is close to our target price, we believe that genting malaysias share price could overshoot the target price in the near term as its momentum is linked to the phased openings of the gitp, it states in the oct 13 report. the research house also says that the groups management had shared that gem is unlikely to give out a special dividend from its genting hong kong stake sale, but may use the proceeds to settle some foreign currency-denominated debt. nevertheless, khoo points out that its sister company, genting singapore, recently gave out a 1.5 singapore cents dividend, which surprised investors. the singapore-listed company saw a 14% y-o-y increase in its net profit to s$195.6 million for the nine months ended sept 30, 2106.  gem recently completed the sale of its 16.87% stake in genting hong kong to related parties tan sri lim kok thay and his family members. the sale raised us$415 million. in an announcement to bursa malaysia on sept 30 on the sale, gem notes that it has yet to identify any specific investment. as at june 30, gems foreign currency-denominated short-term borrowings stood at rm747.1 million and long-term borrowings at rm1.4 billion. it also had long-term local borrowings of rm2.4 billion.

picks that are skewed to a preference for capital preservation, rather than pursuing growth options which the research house argues may carry lower defensibility. in a friday report, analyst neel sinha notes resilient margins among singapore corporates despite yet another poor quarter of financial results. sti earnings expectations have been on a downward trend for most of this year, but we note that the extent of downgrades in this quarter has been a quantum lower than those witnessed in the earlier reporting periods of 2016, and plateauing is likely over the next couple of quarters, says sinha. however, the analyst says the outlook for a rebound remains murky as it will depend on variables such as the direction of singapores non-oil exports and currency. maybank has highlighted four buy recommendations in the singapore market, the first being capitaland commercial trust (cct) at a target price of s$1.81 for what sinha deems attractive forward yields, strong underlying fundamentals of the trusts properties, and the possibility of strong net asset value (nav) support from elevated prices for office assets. jumbo group, too, has been picked for its premium pricing and fast turn, high volume business with a target price of 78 cents. while the f&b operators core market, singapore, provides stable incremental growth, the analyst expects its overseas markets such as china and possibly thailand, to provide higher growth quantum in the coming years. sinha has also picked venture corp, which has been given a target price of s$11, noting its products with structure growth and good margins, plus a strategy to engage with customers. he values venture at 15x pe versus the companys customers rather than other electronics manufacturing services (ems) firms, due to ventures atypical business model which is more ip-intensive and includes sharing in its revenue/profit pool of customers through venues such as product design. keppel reit is another addition to the list for a favourable lease expiry profile. sinha deems the trust as the best proxy to elevated prices for office assets in singapore, and reckons its aggressive land bids for central boulevard imply the company is trading below the replacement cost of assets. keppel reits target price of s$1.21. conversely, the research houses top sell rated stocks are keppel corp, ocbc bank, sats ltd and sembcorp marine. as at 1pm, units of cct and keppel reit are trading at s$1.51 and s$1.06 respectively, while shares of jumbo and venture are trading at the respective prices of 62 cents and

points, from 1,866.96 points at end-2013. before 2014, the fbm klci had ended higher year on year for five straight years, more than recovering from the 569.28-point or 39.3% y-o-y plunge to 876.75 points in 2008. a similar yearly trend was also seen in the fbm emas index, which captures both the fbm top 100 and fbm small cap index constituents (see table). chris eng, head of research, products and alternative investments at etiqa insurance and takaful, reckons the fbm klci still has a chance of ending the year higher. in general, the whole of the august, september and october rally came one month ahead of our expectation, but was not strong enough. we were hoping that the klci could rally above 1,700 points in october before retracing in november. that said, given the weak rally in 3q, we do see a potential for a rebound rally in december after a retracement in november, he says. chan ken yew, head of research at kenanga investment bank, also reckons a year-end rally is still possible if the investing world is not overly unhappy with the us voters choice of a new president and if the us does not hike its key interest rate more than 25 basis points by year-end. the driver of such a rally, if any, is probably the anticipation of an early general election, apart from the year-end window-dressing, says chan, who is keeping his fbm klci target at 1,715 points for 2016 and 1,755 points for 2017. he admits, though, that 1,695 points for end-2016 is probably more realistic. still, chan is hopeful of improved investor sentiment, especially in the small and mid-cap space, aided by the rm3 billion special fund to bolster small and mid-cap stocks proposed in budget 2017 and reportedly backed by deep-pocketed government-linked institutions: the employees provident fund, khazanah nasional bhd, permodalan nasional bhd (pnb), retirement fund inc (kwap) and lembaga tabung haji. us citizens will head to the presidential polls on nov 8 (results are expected around 11am to

the major winners of a us election are defence plays as the world may become a more dangerous place, regardless of whether hillary clinton or donald trump wins, with regional conflicts possibly emerging in asia. otherwise, a clinton win will likely translate into blue chips doing better in malaysia as the risk sentiment improves while a trump win should be bad for emerging markets as a whole, eng surmises. asian shares were mixed last thursday as traders stayed on the sidelines while others sought solace in bonds and gold on the possibility of a trump presidency coming to pass this wednesday. malaysia would also lose in a trump win as he is pushing more broadly for trade protectionism. malaysia is one of the most export-oriented countries in the region, with exports of value-added accounting for 49% of gdp  the second highest in asia after singapore (56%), credit suisse director and head of malaysia equity research tan ting min wrote in an oct 18 note. credit suisses global experts expect global yields to rise and yield curves to steepen under a trump presidency, driven by increased policy uncertainty and higher inflation expectations. this will likely spur outflows from emerging markets and broader risk assets, including from malaysia, the note read. a trump win could also result in a more decisive shift among asian economies towards china and away from the us, including for malaysia. a clinton administration, meanwhile, will likely be more interventionist and assertive in its foreign policy, including taking a harder line on perceived provocations by china, russia or others  a factor that could increase risk of conflicts in asia and the south china sea, including for malaysia. clinton is also likely to renegotiate the trans-pacific partnership agreement (tpp), as she is opposed to its current form. back home, investors believe snap polls might happen next year, although the countrys 14th general election (ge) only needs to be called by may 2018. the general perception is that the malaysian stock market will do well before a general election is called. this would keep malaysia on its toes in 2017. a look at the last six ges shows that the malaysian stock market outperforms the region just one month before a ge, and underperforms one month after. we believe the stock market could be range-bound heading towards a ge if investors are uncertain about the results. post the ge, the performance of the stock market will depend largely on the quality of the win, tan wrote in a sept 2 note when turning less bearish on malaysia. unless the opposition gets its act together, votes for the opposition will be split in many three-cornered fights, thus benefiting the incumbent, market watchers say. others think prime minister datuk seri najib razak might want to wait until theres more feel-good factor on the ground. the bersih 5 rally on nov 19 in kuala lumpur might be a sentiment barometer, one observer says. yes, purely from a stock-market perspective, political stability is a plus, one seasoned fund manager says. whether that alone is enough to bite is another question altogether as there are many factors in play ... and for the better malaysian stocks, some prices have come off but they are not really cheap because you have the large institutions that cannot put a lot more money outside the country, he adds. yes, there is hope for more construction and infrastructure contracts with china but is that really a new story for malaysia? and didnt malaysia also say it stands to benefit from the tpp, which both the us presidential candidates are opposed to? are the people increasing their investments here or expecting earnings to be better next year? the fund manager questions. not everyone is as pessimistic, though. another fund manager is hopeful of opportunities to trade malaysian stocks in the coming six months if one believes most of the negatives have already been priced in: there are opportunities  the wahid effect on pnb is among the positive news flow  but you need to work harder to find them and constantly monitor the good ones for potential drivers. if you have a slightly longer horizon, it doesnt matter if the rally happens in december or march or may, he says. the wahid effect refers to the changes that could happen at pnb, driven by former minister in the prime ministers department and corporate chieftain tan sri abdul wahid omar, who joined as chairman in august. in october, he was joined by former ekuiti nasional bhd ceo datuk abdul rahman ahmad, who is now pnb president and group ceo. we believe the combination of wahid and rahman could herald some real changes in pnb and its main subsidiaries, credit suisses tan wrote in a nov 2 note headlined wahids midas touch. there are lots of low-lying fruits in pnb and its group of companiesu2026 [areas] where management has not worked the assets hard enough, there is a lot of scope for wahid to push for higher returns. wahid, an accountant by training, is famed for his hands-on approach on turning around and cleaning up balance sheets. he has a track record that speaks for itself. during his tenure helming uem group, telekom and maybank, he has managed to execute change and push through changes for the better, especially in two key areas  roes and dividend payouts, tan told clients in the note. pnbs top holdings include a 42% stake in malayan banking bhd, 48% in sime darby bhd and 66% in s p setia bhd. it also has a 14% stake in telekom malaysia, bhd 11% in bimb holdings bhd and 8% in

slowdown ", "article": "  while the queues for tables at food and beverage outlets are getting rare nowadays with consumers tightening their belts, berjaya food bhd (bfood), however, does not intend to put the brakes on opening more starbucks stores. its plan is to open at least 25 starbucks outlets a year until the financial year ending april 30, 2019 (fy2019), according to ceo datuk francis lee kok chuan. the coffee chain operator wants to reach out to more consumers, so shopping malls are not the only places for its outlets. bfood has started drive-through stores, which have the advantage of flexible operating hours, as opposed to those restricted by the hours the malls are open. longer hours would theoretically mean more sales, depending on the location. the drive-through concept is also adopted to counter the decline in footfall in shopping malls. our returns from outlets at malls are getting lower and lower, he tells the edge. in august, starbucks rolled out a new fast-moving consumer goods line  two flavours of bottled coffee, or stock-keeping units (skus). they are doing very well and have exceeded our expectations, lee says, adding that the companys initial expectation was 76,000 bottles a month. hopefully, we can increase the range of our skus in the next 8 to 10 months. in addition, bfood is in talks with mass rapid transit corp sdn bhd on the opening of starbucks outlets in mrt stations. if a deal is struck, the business model may be adjusted to grab-and-go sales by smaller kiosks. according to lee, these kiosks will go towards meeting the groups long-term target of 500 outlets. starbucks has also ventured into the premium coffee segment to cater for coffee connoisseurs. but as consumers are getting cautious about their expenditure, will they continue to go for a cup of premium coffee that costs the equivalent of a meal at a food court? well do a detailed study of the location before committing to open a store. we need to get starbucks approval too. so far, all our new stores have been successful, says lee. he opines that the economic slowdown has bottomed out. the past 15 months were quite bad. can it get any worse? of course, theres always that possibility, but we hope the worst is over. lee says bfood will be able to cope should that scenario come to pass. at present, he says, starbucks growth has not hit a plateau. since the first acquisition of starbucks malaysias stake in 2011, the segment has been the main driver of earnings growth for bfood. the brisk sales of coffee have helped offset the slowing sales of the kenny rogers roasters (krr) division, whose pre-tax profit has been declining in the past four financial years. starbucks malaysia recorded 5% same-store sales growth (sssg) in fy2016 after a flat fy2015, according to the group. sssg in fy2014 was 16%. maybank investment bank expects 4% sssg per annum for starbucks malaysia over the next three financial years. in fy2016 ended april 30, bfoods core net profit fell to rm21 million from rm26 million a year ago. however, revenue expanded 47% year on year to rm544 million. the surge in revenue can be attributed to it being the first financial year that enjoyed the full consolidation of earnings generated by starbucks outlets. bfood bought the remaining 50% stake in starbucks malaysia in 2014. in 1qfy2017 ended july 31, 2016, bfood reported an 18% decline in net profit to rm5 million. revenue, however, rose 6.7% y-o-y to rm141 million. the group said sales from existing and new outlets were higher but the weaker ringgit trimmed starbucks profit margins. krrs contribution was also lower. the earnings numbers have missed analysts estimates. in a sept 8 note, rhb research describes the quarterly results as uninspiring. maybank investment bank has cut bfood forecasts, although it is maintaining its buy call on the stock. it says the valuation is undemanding, premised on starbucks sustained organic growth and aggressive expansion. hong leong investment bank, in an oct 14 note, says margins for starbucks will remain depressed until the ringgit strengthens significantly against the us dollar. it downgraded bfood to a sell. still, lee is optimistic. things are turning around, as seen in some of our restaurants sales. other players are seeing some sssg as well. the main concern of most players in the retail industry is the weakness of the ringgit against other currencies ... we cant simply pass on the costs to consumers, he says. the weaker ringgit against the greenback has squeezed starbucks profit margin as 40% of its product cost is us dollar-denominated, according to lee. the six-month extension of the price control and anti-profiteering act 2011, which only expires on dec 31, 2016, is not helping either. bfood has kept starbucks prices largely unchanged in the past five years. this means that the group will be pursuing the volume game for a bigger market share, says lee. were still profitable. as long as my stores dont lose money, i will continue to open [more stores] and employ [more] people. and as long as the top line continues to grow, the bottom line will come. apart from the earnings numbers, bfoods expansion plan may be a concern for shareholders. for perspective, a typical starbucks store in a shopping mall would cost about rm800,000 to set up while a drive-through outlet would cost more than rm1 million, according to the group. the strain from the rapid growth could be showing now. bfoods free cash flow was in negative territory in four of the past five financial quarters, according to bloomberg data. lee says this was due to the groups debt reduction programme. we borrowed to buy into starbucks malaysia. we have cleared about rm120 million worth of debt since we bought it (the remaining 50% stake in starbucks malaysia) in 2014. the rate of expansion will depend on the cash flow, he says. the cash-based nature of starbucks sales has put bfood in a strong financial position as it does not have to worry about collecting payment. bfoods share price dipped to rm1.27 in mid-august  the lowest level since the group owned the starbucks chain in malaysia wholly  after hitting a high of rm3.30 in november 2014. it rebounded and closed at rm1.87 last friday. the downward trend may be an indication of investors concern over the softening of consumer spending. the success of starbucks malaysia is one that tycoon tan sri vincent tan always boasts about. when he started the venture at the height of the 1998 asian financial crisis, probably only a handful thought that the coffee chain would survive. now, starbucks is facing another slowdown, which some economists think could be a severe one. it will be interesting to see how tans son datuk robin tan (executive chairman of bfood) and his team navigate this challenging situation.

stocks", "article": "  kuala lumpur: gaming stocks have recovered some lost grounds after their worst slides in recent years as analysts turn more positive on the gaming industry. they believe the sectors growth story remains intact, with some saying the worst is over. most are placing their chips on casino operators, particularly genting malaysia bhd as they see its rm10.38 billion genting integrated tourism plan (gitp), which aims to attract 30 million visitors by 2020, as a major catalyst for the stock. genting malaysia shares are up 31% after falling to a three-year low of rm3.67 in january last year. the stock hit an all-time high of rm4.91 on oct 13 before closing at rm4.79 last friday. genting bhd shares have also climbed 21% after falling to a five-year low of rm6.57 in august last year. they closed at rm7.93 last friday. uob kay hian research head for malaysia vincent khoo is of the view that the stock price of genting malaysia will continue to be supported by the gitp as the project progressively unrolls. as the market tends to be forward looking, the opening of phase 1 of the gitp will help to drive up genting malaysia shares even though the company will only see significant contribution in earnings from financial year ending dec 31, 2018, khoo told the edge financial daily via telephone. in a report dated oct 13, khoo said phase 1 of the gitp amenities is set to open progressively over a period of one year starting from end-2016. specifically, there will be partial opening of both the new gaming area and retail area (sky avenue mall), as well as new cable car operations by year end. ta securities gaming analyst tan kam meng concurred, saying the gitp is viewed as a core engine to fuel genting malaysias future earnings growth and fend off regional competition. the recent disposal of its entire stake (16.87%) in [cruise operator] genting hong kong ltd is a positive development in our view. while the disposal will result in a disposal loss of rm264 million, the proceeds (rm1.7 billion) will be channelled to the development of the gitp, said tan. alliancedbs research gaming analyst cheah king yoong has genting malaysia as a top pick for the gaming sector, noting three catalysts to rerate the stock  additional gaming capacities arising from the gitp launches, the weak ringgit which will help attract more foreign tourists and malaysians to genting highlands, and rising optimism over the companys earnings outlook with its gitp launches. in a report dated oct 12, cheah said that any near-term potential price weakness due to budget 2017s concerns over the gaming sector could provide opportunities to invest in genting group stocks. mercury securities head of research edmund tham told the edge financial daily that one of the key risks to genting group is the reliance on tourists from china. should we see a lower number of tourists from china, it will hurt genting groups [forward earnings]. however, in recent years, we have seen a slowdown in macaus casinos and this has benefited genting group. it is possible that due to the anti-corruption stance in china, people are afraid to go to macau for gambling and in turn, opt for countries like malaysia. however, it remains to be seen if the tourist numbers can be sustained, said tham, adding that he likes berjaya sports toto bhd (btoto) over genting group stocks for the formers predictable dividend payouts. while most analysts expect the gitp to benefit genting bhd as well, concerns remain over its singapore business  via its 53%-owned subsidiary genting singapore plc  that is not doing well. genting singapore contributed 47.2% of genting bhds consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation in 2015. one of the reasons that the singapore business is not doing so well is due to the expensive singapore dollar. the vip volume is still shrinking and this could hurt genting bhd, said ta securities tan. meanwhile, shares in number forecast operators (nfos) have also come off their lows in the last three years. btotos stock settled at rm3.20 last friday, after touching a three-year low of rm2.75 on aug 28 last year. similarly, magnum bhd shares have risen 8% from its three-year low of rm2.16 in june to close at rm2.33 last friday. while most analysts said the biggest challenge for nfos is the intensified competition from illegal nfo activities, they like the stocks for their dividend plays. with bank negara malaysias interest rate cut [to 3%] this year, dividend stocks have been getting a lot of play. in this regard, btoto offers a decent yield of about 6%, said tan. tan said the goods and services tax (gst), which was implemented on april 1, 2015, has somewhat affected btotos revenue performance from toto betting. however, he expects its effect will no longer be reflected in the comparison going forward. tan also noted that the slump in consumer sentiment has bottomed out after people have adjusted to the gst, which could prove positive for nfo stocks. according to public investment bank bhd analyst eltricia foong li ching, magnums dividend yield remains attractive despite declaring lower dividends of seven sen for the first half of its financial year ended june 30, 2016 compared with 10 sen in the year-ago period. in a report dated oct 5, maybank ib research upgraded its call on magnum to buy from hold, with a rm2.58 target price as it believes that the nfo industry is stabilising on recovering consumer sentiment. as budget 2017 draws closer, concern over a possible tax hike on the gaming sector also poses a major risk to the players. however, alliancedbs researchs cheah doesnt expect any tax hike to happen in the upcoming budget, which will be announced on friday.this stance is premised on the fact that the genting group has helped to pump prime and create jobs for the domestic economy through its gitp, which will directly/indirectly increase contributions to government coffers. secondly, increasing tax on nfos could in fact lower tax revenue collection by the authorities. the imposition of a higher tax rate on the gaming sector may [also] not have a material impact on the governments tax revenue as it is estimated to contribute less than 1% of the governments total revenue in 2016, he added. tan also thinks a gaming tax hike is unlikely given that the industry has yet to fully recover from the implementation of the gst. any hike might in fact lead to genting malaysia scaling back its gitp investment. given the economic implications of the mega project, we do not think the government will impose a higher gaming tax which could potentially derail the progress on [the] gitp, he said. tan also shared that the current gaming tax in malaysia is already moderately high compared with its regional peers. in singapore, the gross gaming revenue (ggr) generated from premium and mass players will only be taxed at 5% and 15% respectively, and this is on top of the 7% gst imposed on net win in deriving the ggr. as for macau, the ggr is taxed at 35% plus two additional contributions of up to 2% and 3% for socioeconomic purpose. however, casinos in macau do not pay corporate taxes. in comparison, genting malaysia is paying 25% of gaming tax and a 6% gst, tan added. with budget 2017 expected to be largely a people-friendly budget with the possibility of a snap election taking place in mid-2017, analysts in general are optimistic about the prospects for gaming companies."}, "89": {"date_posted": "13/10/2016", "title": "cover story: are glics crowding out dynamism in the local market?", "article": "  having exited asian markets en masse in recent years, foreign funds are returning to the region this year. the msci all country asia ex japan index has rebounded strongly, up 29% from the one-year low on jan 21 (see chart 1). most regional bourses are riding these fund inflows. for instance, the jakarta stock exchange composite index is up 17% year to date while thailands set index has gained 16%. however, one country stands out: malaysia. having declined 1.4% this year, the fbm klci has been the worst performer in asean. with gross domestic product (gdp) growth of 4% in 2q vis-u00e0-vis world banks global growth forecast of 2.4%, this raises the question as to why malaysian shares are not performing. malaysia has historically been a low beta market, hence its quantum of returns will not be as much as its neighbours. however, for this year, the fbm klci has been exceptionally weak  in ringgit terms, it is in negative territory while in us dollar terms, it is positive but in very low single digit, teh chi-cheun, ceo and executive director of pacific mutual fund bhd tells the edge. from an economic perspective, one of the key reasons is that malaysia is a net energy exporter while our neighbours are net importers. looking at the average price of oil, on a year-to-date basis, it is substantially down compared to 2015. our neighbours have benefited from the lower energy prices, while for malaysia, its the opposite. in addition, from an international investors perspective, indonesias gdp growth is much stronger than malaysia and significant reforms are being undertaken, which are incrementally positive for the country, he adds. nonetheless, others believe that there are structural issues that led to the underperformance of the fbm klci. jonathan reoch, director and lead strategist at blackrocks asian equities team, told the edge in an earlier interview that it is hard for foreign investors to find mispricing opportunities in the local stock market due the strong local ownership by government-linked investment companies (glics). for bottom-up investors like us, its about relative valuation and whether companies can meet their earnings forecasts. while we still expect malaysia to grow at 4%, its difficult to see this growth translating into good company earnings. in terms of valuation, we find it (bursa malaysia) quite an expensive market relative to other regional markets, probably reflecting the strong pension system here. that does tend to mean that you dont get big opportunities as you do in [markets like] indonesia, which relies much more on foreign fund flows, he explained. in an efficient market-driven market, prices tend to move in tandem or at least in the same direction with valuations. as seen in chart 2, this relationship by and large held until september last year. since then, there has been a divergence between market prices and valuations. interestingly, the government announced in last september the revival of equity fund valuecap sdn bhd to help boost underperforming shares and stabilise the financial market. following the announcement, the market started to recoup some losses. for this purpose, rm20 billion will be injected into the fund, shared equally by the three glics, namely kwap, pnb and khazanah. kwap, khazanah and pnb had injected rm1 billion each when the programme started in december last year, with another rm3 billion to be injected in the state-owned fund this year. according to data compiled by the edge (see table), glics own an aggregate 39% equity interest of the fbm klci constituent companies, and nine of the 10 largest companies are government-linked corporations (glcs). given the dominance of the glics and glcs in corporate malaysia, some argue the government directive to repatriate foreign investments back last year would only increase the size of the domestic captive funds and crowd out the dynamism in the local market. however, teh thinks this is not a serious issue as long as there is ample liquidity and trading. crowding out happens where large government participation stifles private sector participation. in this case, the concern will be if government funds just buy and hold the stocks and this stifles liquidity such that the market price cannot be found. as long as there is an ample free float and sufficient market participants that are willing to trade, it should not be an issue, he notes. according to bloomberg data, the employees provident fund (epf) invests 95% of its equity funds in malaysian shares and the remaining 5% in the uk and singapore. other glics like khazanah, tabung haji, pnb and kwap have more than 99% of their equity funds invested in the local stock market. in contrast, japans government pension investment fund and singapores temasek holdings pte ltd allocate 57% and 56% of their equity funds in their respective domestic market. there has been growing recognition among glics that it is risky to put all your eggs in one basket by only investing in the local market. epf ceo datuk shahril ridza ridzuan told the media that the provident funds overseas holdings helped diversify risks and buffer the weak ringgit and local stocks in 2015. last week, uber confirmed in a statement that it had received an investment from kwap, the funds first direct investment in a foreign company as part of its effort to become a diversified global investor. meanwhile, other market observers believe governments increased efforts to stabilise the local stock market could be signs of an early 14th general election and thus, are temporary in nature. the 2017 national budget on 21 oct could also be a pre-election budget with the 13th parliament session

pushes consolidation in the world's second-biggest market. reliance communications, controlled by billionaire anil ambani, and aircel's parent malaysia's maxis communications bhd will each own 50 percent of the merged carrier, the two sides said in a joint statement on wednesday. the merged business with more than 190 million customers will overtake idea cellular ltd in terms of subscription

by bharti airtel ltd and vodafone group plc's indian unit. with more than 1 billion mobile phone subscriptions, india's telecoms market is the world's second-biggest behind china, but tough competition means low margins. competition is intensifying further with reliance jio, a new 4g telecoms venture backed by anil's elder brother and india's richest man mukesh ambani, that started operations this month is expected to shake up the market with its cut-rate services. \"we expect this combination to create substantial long-term value for shareholders of both ... given the benefits of the wide-ranging spectrum portfolio and significant revenue and cost synergies,\" reliance communications chairman anil ambani said in the statement. the two sides are also talking to international

cables and data centres after the deal closure in 2017. \"it is just another way of surviving,\" jigar shah, chief executive at maybank kimeng securities india, said of the deal. \"they can become better only if the two partners bring further cash into the business and they buy a reasonable amount of 4g spectrum.\" in the first sign of sector consolidation, reliance communications in november

agree that the risk of a new market telco entrant has significantly spiked u2013 although in nomuras view, it is still too early to take a specific stance on the spectrums results. citi has raised its probability of a new entrant from 25% to 85% and expects a fourth player would be able to take 7.5% of the sectors market share by fy21. maybank has downgraded its previously neutral view on the telco sector to an outright negative one, noting that the surprise appearance of three  not two, or even zero potential bidders as was the possibility earlier. the way nomuras research team sees it, there is no clarity on conditions of funding or term sheet details for the potential new entrants at this stage, therefore making it difficult to give a definitive view. our view has been that the economics dont necessarily stack up in favour of new entrants. there is no mandatory roaming and the regulator is stringent on quality of service (qos) requirements, explains nomura in a report last thursday. the incumbent telcos have made price revisions and there may now be less room to correct pricing inefficiencies, it adds. to recap, there are now three potential bidders in the race to become singapores fourth telco operator through the infocomm development authority of singapores (ida) upcoming new entrant spectrum auction. ida last week received three expressions of interest (eoi) from fibre broadband operator myrepublic, australian telco tpg telecom, and newly-established company airyotta, whose management is reportedly fronted by two senior executives of dropped-out spectrum bidders omgtel and consistel. both maybank and citi concede that victory is highly likely for tpg, considering its reputation for having a low-cost pricing model, mobile virtual network operator (mvno) operations in its australian home market, as well as its dm fixed-line experience. should tpg enter, we believe that risk extends beyond just the mobile business, but also on the fixed lien space through the use/resale of the next generation nationwide broadband network (ngnbn), says citis lead analyst arthur pineda. maybank analyst gregory yap has also identified myrepublic a contender with a better chance as it is already competing in singapores broadband market. he believes ida should be more confident in both tpg and myrepublic as compared to the newly set-up airyotta.  with the highest exposure to domestic mobile services compared to its peers, m1 has the most to lose to a new mobile entrant in terms of consumer market share. the telco has therefore been downgraded by citi and maybank, from neutral to sell with a lower target price of s$2.40, as well as from hold to sell with its target price reduced to s$2.04 respectively. m1s fellow smaller operator, starhub, is also at similar risk. citis pineda suggests that even starhubs fixed broadband services, which contribute to 26% of the telcos revenues, may not be safe as there are opportunities for tpg extending into the broadband/fixed voice space through the ngnbm wholesale. however, yap and pineda both think the extent of market share loss will not hit starhub as it will m1 due to its subscriber incentives and lower exposure. as singtels mobile business accounts for only 12% of its revenue, maybanks yap says he sees limited impact from the entrant of new consumer mobile rivals. likewise, citis pineda agrees that the telco appears best placed among its rivals, although it wont escape unscathed. he is projecting 1%-3% potential dilution should a fourth player appear. while citi has kept singtel at buy at a lower target price of s$4.66, maybank maintains its hold call on the stock with a lower target price of s$3.70. nomura, too, has highlighted singtel as its choice stock for the sector, noting the telco as a dominant player in its segment as well as its strong cash position and balance sheet. as such, its research analysts believe responding to mobile competition or acquiring additional spectrum, especially in the 900mhjz range, in the upcoming auctions shouldnt be difficult. on monday, m1, starhub and singtel closed at s$2.53, s$3.40 and s$3.95 respectively."}, "99": {"date_posted":

in margins from 25% to 18.6%, due to price competition and higher costs, for its weaker earnings. once seen as a safe haven, exporters are also losing their shine. export performance has been quite weak in 2q. gross domestic product growth in the us and europe point to weaker demand in the second half. weak exchange rates have helped exporters profits in the past. but now, with the same base, profit growth will be weaker, says peck boon soon, who heads asean economics for rhb research institute. keep in mind, however, that many of these weaknesses are already anticipated. market expectation on corporate earnings has been trimmed following earlier negative surprises. given more muted expectations now, we expect most companies within our coverage to report earnings within expectation, says bernard ching who heads research at alliancedbs research. however, he also has some concerns going forward. we are wary of asset quality issues in a handful of banks while plantation companies may still face earnings risk due to fresh fruit bunch yield loss, he explains. thus far, some of the worst 2h results that have been posted include malaysia marine and heavy engineering

british american tobacco (malaysia) bhd which saw a 78% and 11.5% y-o-y fall in net profit and revenue respectively. this was due to tariff-led price hikes, inflationary cost pressures and loss of market share to illicit cigarettes. given the bearish outlook, it is no surprise, then, that there has been a strong rotation to defensive sectors like real estate investment trusts (reits) and consumer staples. consumer staples, however, have proven to be more stable than the reits. counters like axis reit and capitaland malaysia malls trust have been relatively disappointing thus far says gan. but then again, funds do not have many options. if you need to put money somewhere, where would you put it? there is not much growth anywhere else, he says, explaining why funds have increased their allocations in such defensive stocks. it may look expensive, but it depends on what you compare it against. when you consider that one-fifth of the worlds government bonds have negative yields, then it doesnt look too bad, he points out. one catalyst for reits would be an additional interest rate cut, says gan, but he points out that it is a scenario many are already pricing in. on a separate note, consumer staples look to remain stable despite the slowing economic growth. the one bright spot, relatively speaking, is consumer spending, which is expected to remain level. barring any adjustments on the cost side, consumer stocks should be able to generate stable earnings, says peck. that said, last week saw a slight sell-off in consumer stocks like nestlu00e9 malaysia bhd and fraser & neave holdings bhd (f&n) after both counters hit new record highs. it is worth noting that f&n posted a 12.8% y-o-y increase in net profit to rm93.55 million while revenue increased 1.8% to rm1.096 billion for the quarter ended june 30. nestlu00e9s share price is sitting on a 13.22% y-o-y gain, closing at rm79.68 per share last friday, while f&n gained 35.65% in the same period to rm24.5 apiece. beyond the defensive plays, one sector that might have a more positive outlook is the construction sector, given the huge amount of infrastructure work still in the pipeline. ching points out that construction award news flow will pick up in 2h, which bodes well for construction earnings moving forward. even in the first half, many sizeable contracts have been awarded already. on the other side of the coin is the property sector, which is still riding on sales made in previous years. while the billings are expected to prop up earnings for the near term, weaker new sales mean that profits will eventually drop off. for now, it appears that the status quo will hold. stocks have already been sold down to reflect weaker earnings, and with no obvious catalyst in sight, it is expected to remain this way. that said, some exceptions to the rule are beginning to emerge, like the rally in felda global ventures holdings bhd (fgv) to a one-year high of rm1.95 per share last week, despite weak crude palm oil prices. fgv fell into the red in the quarter ended march 31 but it is expected to show an improvement in the subsequent quarter.

defensive stocks have become all the rage among investors. apart from the typical dividend-yielding stocks and real estate investment trusts (reits), bursa malaysia bhd seems to have garnered investor interest recently. the counter, which is usually tepid on news flow, saw its share price climbing in late june, increasing 4.1% to rm8.89 last thursday. analysts have pointed out that the sudden interest stems from the realisation that the counter provides decent dividend yields for investors looking for a safe haven in the low-interest-rate environment. it is a relatively defensive stock, provides decent dividends and is cash-rich. the dividend payout ratio is about 90% to 95%, says an analyst. based on its current price of rm8.89 per share, the dividend yield amounts to 4%. historically, bursa has consistently rewarded its shareholders. in the last five financial years, the dividend payout ratio has been between 91.5% and 98.5%, with dividend yield between 3.9% and 6.7%. bursas revenue, which is derived from the daily trading volume on the stock exchange, is highly dependent on market velocity. this implies that its earnings would be susceptible to market sentiment and market volatility. about 48% of its operating revenue stemmed from securities trading while derivatives trading contributed about 18%, according to its 2015 annual report. this year, derivatives trading has been gathering momentum, helping to offset some of the weaknesses on the securities trading side. the stock exchange will be unveiling its second-quarter earnings result ended june 30, 2016, on monday, july 25, and analysts are expecting it to fall within their forecast range.   equities average daily volume (adv) averaged rm2 billion in 2q2016 and we estimate velocity was at 30%, little changed y-o-y and q-o-q. derivatives volume was, however, strong at 3.88 million in 2q2016 driven by crude palm oil futures (fcpo), at 82% of total volume. these 2q2016 numbers led 1h2016 equities adv to rm2.03 billion and derivatives volume to 7.35 million, comments maybank investment bank research in a note last week.  in the past five years, the exchange saw the highest velocity of 33% in fy2011. meanwhile, midf researchs estimates of the adv traded for the securities market is slightly below maybank ib researchs, at rm1.83 billion with a lower velocity of 28%. it added that revenue from combined securities trading and clearing fees could drop to rm49.3 million in 2qfy2016 based on its forecast. the research house said that the lower figures were dragged by weaker securities trading activities in june when investors turned more cautious from weaker sentiment on uncertainties surrounding the uks vote to leave the european union. nevertheless, the stock exchange should be able to continue doling out generous dividends despite the weakness in its main revenue churner. bursa has a strong balance sheet. it has no debts, its in a net cash position, its a monopoly and has strong cash-flow generation. it doesnt need much capital expenditure either. the dividend should be sustainable, says an analyst. its operating revenue for the first quarter ended march 31, 2016, showed a 5.3% increase to rm126.13 million from rm119.79 million a year ago. net profit gained 6.1% to rm49.94 million from rm47.06 million previously. as at march 31, 2016, bursas cash and bank balances stood at rm338.12 million. maybank ib research opines that bursa may announce a 17 sen dividend per share for its first interim dividend for fy2016 when it releases its results this week.  for the full year, we forecast 36.5 sen dividend per share, which gives a 4.1% yield. unencumbered cash stood at rm338 million or 63 sen per share as at end-march 2016 and, after deducting for fy2015s final dividend of 18 sen per share, the pro-forma cash balance should remain a sizeable rm242 million, at 45 sen per share, it says. the research house adds that the stock exchange can pay more as previous special dividends in fy2013 and fy2014 were at 20 sen per share. the total dividend payout for fy2013 totalled 52 sen per share while for fy2014, it totalled 54 sen a share. an analyst, who says the current share price at rm8.90 is close to his target price, thinks that a special dividend would definitely be an upside for the counter. however, he opines that it is unlikely to be given out at this juncture.  currently, there are five buy and 10 hold calls on the counter, according to bloomberg. the target prices range from rm8.30 to rm10.10 per share. based on the rm10.10 forecast by ubs and dbs vickers, the counter is still at a 13.5% discount to the target price.  over a one-year period, bursa malaysias share price gained 14.91% from rm7.74 to rm8.89 last thursday. kumpulan

dwindling car sales should have minimal impact on pecca group bhd, according to pecca groups executive director michael tan, who noted that there is less correlation between the companys performance and the total industry volume (tiv). there is this misconception about us as being part of the auto-parts industry. auto parts mean items like batteries, which have a higher correlation with tiv. in our case, leather upholstery is normally found in the premium variants or luxury segment of car models, which is less impacted during the slowdown as witnessed by the increased sales of luxury car segment recently, tan told the edge financial daily in an interview. a fund manager with a local asset management also concurred with tan, saying that with the slowdown in car sales, it is likely to have an increase in promotional activities by car manufacturers to induce sales, which could eventually benefit the leather upholstery business. there is a trend in the past for car manufacturers to offer freebies such as leather seats when sales are less than optimistic. this could lead to a higher demand for leather upholstery business, he said. that said, the companys earnings for the financial quarter ended june 30, 2016 (3qfy16) were below expectations with a net profit of rm3.1 million  33.3% below the previous corresponding quarter. its net profit of rm11.6 million for the nine-month period ended june 30, 2016 is only 58% of maybank ib researchs initial full-year forecast. the tiv declined by 46,795 units or 14.5% year-on-year in the first half of 2016, according to malaysian automotive association. however, tan noted that the recent launch of the sedan car by perusahaan otomobil kedua sdn bhd (perodua), one of its major customers, is positive for pecca group. this will be helpful to us. i think the only car manufacturer still talking about sustaining the growth momentum or maintaining the volume selling is perodua, tan said. last month, pecca groups share price hit its all-time high of rm1.88 since its listing in april after perodua launched its first sedan car, bezza, over that week. maybank ib research said that the groups 4qfy16 should be better on the back of the new launch. the groups long-standing relationships with key clients such as toyota boshuku umw sdn bhd and fuji seats (malaysia) sdn bhd have also enabled pecca group to be the sole supplier of leather seat covers to perodua. the company supplies car seat covers to fuji seats and perodua sales sdn bhd, tan said. according to tan, the barrier of entry to the car leather upholstery industry is rather high. pecca group commands a lions share of 68% of the domestic original equipment manufacturing and pre-delivery inspection passenger vehicle segments in 2015. the companys available patented technology such as smart fit is an example of its expertise. smart fit is a patented technology that pecca group introduced so that leather car seat cover can be installed for any car without the need to dismantle the car seat. we believe we will see higher volume for smart fit car seat cover, said tan when commenting on pecca groups outlook moving into fy17. pecca groups established presence in providing high-quality standards to the automotive industry has enabled it to penetrate new markets such as the aviation sector and overseas. one of the examples is the vda 6.3 audit standard for oe (original equipment) fit car seat covers that we obtained. this enabled the group to penetrate the european marque market such as volkswagen. as for the aviation sector, the group has been appointed a vendor to a commercial craft for parts refurbishment work after it obtained the approval from the department of civil aviation malaysia on the parts refurbishment scope and is expected to secure approval for aviation leather upholstery as well, tan said. on its fundamentals, pecca groups balance sheet is expected to improve with the proceeds from its initial public

kuala lumpur: as listed companies earnings decline and their share prices fall, once-reliable defensive stocks are beginning to look elusive. defensive stocks in sectors such as brewery, tobacco and gaming, along with real estate investment trusts (reits), are popular among investors seeking to safeguard their investment in stormy markets. the edge weekly reported last week that companies listed on bursa malaysia paid lower dividends in the first quarter of this year, due to declining profits. this has raised questions on the ability of the safe haven counters to help tide over market volatility. fund managers and analysts, however, remain bullish on defensive stocks. they explained that in the case of the tobacco firms and brewery stocks, the companies were hit by falling demand for the products after prices were hiked in the wake of excise duty increases. there was some concern with regard to one tobacco counter, british american tobacco (malaysia) bhd (bat), recently when the company slashed its dividend by 42% to 45 sen from 78 sen a year ago. this came about after the companys second-quarter net profit fell 78.2% to rm47.72 million while revenue declined 11.5% to rm962.58 million. we believe that the trend seen in bat is more industry specific, uob asset management (m) bhd chief executive officer (ceo) lim suet ling told the edge financial daily in an email, noting that the tobacco industry has little choice but to keep raising cigarette prices mainly due to excise duty increases by the government. the sharp increase in prices has a negative effect on the volume in the legal cigarette market, lim explained. having said that, she pointed out that most consumer staple companies are still viewed to be defensive as they are benefiting from relatively resilient demand and strong cash flow, which translate to attractive dividends to shareholders. areca capital sdn bhd ceo danny wong concurred, saying the defensive stocks are still a good investment strategy in the long term. wong said the recent interest rate cut by bank negara malaysia indicated that malaysia could follow other economies in relaxing policies to facilitate economic growth.this is quite positive to dividend or income stocks, he said, as the risk-free rate for reits will come down near to the overnight policy rate (opr) level and is valuation positive to reits. risk-free rate represents the interest that an investor would expect from an absolutely risk-free investment over a given period of time. theoretically, the cut in opr should lead to lower interest payments by reits who borrow money for asset purchasing, and it would also boost disposal incomes for consumers.the sector, however, has its own problems to be tackled. among them include the weaker consumer sentiment and the oversupply glut in the retail and office spaces. both may be the laggers of their earnings as tenants seek lower store rentals. wong, however, remains positive on retail-centred reits with good-quality assets such as igb reit, sunway reit and pavilion reit. their main markets are [the growing] middle income group. although the [consumer] sentiment was not there [yet], they will still shop. as long as the crowd is there, there will be demand for their shops, he said. wong pointed out that the securities commission malaysias recent move to give reits more value by allowing them to purchase land and build their own properties as well as expand or redevelop existing ones, would be another positive development for reits. the news is positive to sunway reit, klcc stapled group and mrcb-quill reit, who have construction arms, he said. aside from reits, wong said investors should also keep track on stocks that are constantly paying dividend such as consumer stocks of companies with stellar earnings such as dutch lady milk industries bhd, fraser & neave holdings bhd and malayan banking bhd. he added that padini holdings bhd is another stock that is worth a look as it positions itself in the value buy segment. people are looking for value-buy products. padini is not a high-end product, hence i believe it could still grow despite the consumer spending slowdown, he said, expecting consumer sentiment to recover in the fourth quarter this year. jf apex securities bhd head of research lee chung cheng also recommended investors to look at reits for investment under current market conditions as they have a steady recurring income to support earnings. lee favoured retail-centered reits, and saw more upside on sunway reit as there could be more asset injections from its parent company sunway bhd. further, sunway is also embarking on more developments ... these are all potential assets to sunway reit, he said. for office reits, lee added that klccp should be in a better position as it still commands grade a tenants with a stable earnings track record. he also weighed on axis reit in the industrial reit segment, noting that the trust manager will continue its asset acquisitions in the niche industrial segment. axis reit in may announced that it was acquiring a single-storey warehouse located in pasir gudang, johor for rm33 million from orientant

rm48.50. bats chart trend in the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is firmly down. from a weekly wave 3 low of rm40.24 (may 2016), its share price rebounded on a wave 4 retracement to a recent high of rm56.18 (july 2016). after the rm56.18 high, its share price collapsed this week on its wave 5 downside move. as its share price broke above its recent key critical support levels of rm49.62

to 1,600.92 in 21 days in january as investors were unnerved by steep falls in chinese equity markets. the index has somewhat recovered since then, moving to 1,727.99 points on april 15 and closed at 1,668.40 last friday. as the market enters 2h16, meena lakshana and yimie yong took a look at how the 10 stock picks the edge financial daily featured on jan 4 fared in 1h16 and whether the analysts views remain unchanged.  sunway construction group bhd sunway construction group bhd (suncon), which was seen as the best proxy to the construction sector this year underpinned by a strong infrastructure pipeline, had seen its share price climb 21% this year to close at rm1.65 last friday, with a market capitalisation of rm2.13 billion. its strong outstanding order book of rm5 billion, which translates into 2.6 times of its revenue in the financial year ended dec 31, 2015, and expectations of more public infrastructure projects to be rolled out are keeping suncon on ta securities list of stock picks, with a target price of rm1.80. in a recent report, ta securities expects suncon to win as much as rm2.5 billion worth of jobs this year. this is supported by internal construction jobs of rm500 million to rm800 million a year (from sunway group) as bedrock orders. the research firm also pointed to suncons cash-rich balance sheet. the group has a net cash position of 23 sen per share. with the current net cash position and limited capital expenditure requirement, there is a potential upside to its dividend payout going forward, said ta securities. based on its minimum dividend payout of 35%, we expect suncon to offer reasonable dividend yield of about 3%. however, suncons earnings did not fare well in the first quarter ended march 31, 2016, falling 15.5% to rm29.06 million. its revenue shed 14.5% to rm424.5 million due to lower billings as some of the projects had reached or were near their completion stage.  inari amertron bhd year to date, inari amertron bhds share price had slipped 18% to close at rm2.96 last friday, with a market capitalisation of rm2.83 billion. the stock has been trading in a 52-week range of rm2.24 to rm3.96. in a note to clients on may 18, cimb equity research analyst mohd shanaz noor azam blamed the stocks decline on weak sentiment across the sector following the decline in apples iphone production and the strengthening of the ringgit against the us dollar. he believed inaris fundamentals remain intact given that its key customer, broadcom, expects radio frequency content in smartphones to grow by more than 20% per year over the next three years. moreover, inari is also diversifying its earnings stream with its latest venture into china, following an investment in pcl technologies. the research firm, which still counts inari as its top pick in the semiconductor sector, is maintaining its add call on inari, but with a lower target price of rm3.15 from rm3.65 previously. we expect inari to show stronger earnings growth in the fourth financial quarter ended june 30, 2016, driven by recovery in industry demand on the back of new smartphone launches in 2h16. therefore, we believe inari is still on track for another year of record profits in fy16, said mohd shanaz. ta securities technology analyst paul yap told the edge financial daily that a major smartphone launch in 2h16, inaris ramp-up of capacity to 680 testers by september and a weak ringgit, which the research firm forecasts to slip to rm4.20 by year end, are expected to boost inaris performance in 2h16.  ewein bhd year-on-year, ewein bhd has kept its earnings growth momentum going this year. mercury securities research head edmund tham said the penang-based property developer has been posting consistent earnings over the past few quarters. indeed, eweins growth numbers have been impressive, mainly driven by its property development business. purely based on recent results, its fundamentals are intact. it (earnings growth) looks sustainable, he told the edge financial daily. for the first quarter ended march 31, 2016, ewein posted a 514% increase in net profit to rm4.17 million on the back of a 108.23% jump in revenue to rm20.24 million, mainly due to recognition of profits from its city of dreams project in penang. ewein is jointly developing the rm800 million condominium project in bandar tanjong pinang with consortium zenith bucg sdn bhd. however, eweins share price movement does not reflect the earnings growth. year to date, the stock had tumbled 28% from rm1.28 on dec 31, 2015 to close at 92 sen last friday, valuing it at rm204.12 million.  sasbadi holdings bhd despite being in a business often seen as recession-proof, educational publisher sasbadi holdings bhd saw its quarterly net profit fall for the first time since its listing on the main market of bursa malaysia in july 2014, in the second financial quarter ended feb 29, 2016 (2qfy16). its net profit dropped 20% to rm6.64 million compared with rm8.34 million in 2qfy15, even though revenue rose 5% to rm33.86 million from rm32.11 million. it blamed the decrease in net profit on higher resources used for the textbook tender participation. in spite of the slightly tepid results, hong leong investment bank research continues to like sasbadi due to its strong annual free cash flow, high growth rate, its innovativeness in creating products that cater to technology-savvy youth and unique education exposure, which is closely linked to the countrys education system. in a report on june 20, its analyst mardhiah omar reiterated a buy call on sasbadi, with a target price of rm1.55, implying a potential 21% upside to its closing price of rm1.22 last friday. however, mardhiah said its earnings forecast for fy16 has been slightly reduced by 4% as the research firm believes that the group would be slightly affected by the weak purchasing power and tough business environment. hence, we are expecting a softer 2h16 for the group.  cahya mata sarawak bhd cahya mata sarawak bhd (cms), touted as one of the best proxies for the mega projects in sarawak, reported disappointing net profit in the first quarter ended march 31, 2016 (1qfy16). its earnings plunged 98% to rm1.05 million from rm57.42 million in 1qfy15, as revenue fell by 29% year-on-year and due to lower profit margin as well as share of substantial losses in associates. rhb research, which had a buy call on cms, has downgraded the stock to neutral as it cuts its earnings forecast for fy16 and fy17 by 14.8% and 7.6% respectively and lowers its target price (tp) to rm4.80 from rm5.86 initially. the tp still offers a 34% potential upside from last fridays closing price of rm3.58. year to date, however, cms has lost almost 30% of its value from rm5.09 on dec 31, 2015. in a report dated april 14, the research firm said cms subscription to rm110 million convertible preference shares in om materials (sarawak) sdn bhd suggested that the latters business environment may be more challenging than rhb research had initially projected. it continues to like cms as the best proxy to the rapid development activities in sarawak. we believe its medium- to longer-term outlook remains bright and cms could make a comeback as soon as 2h16, rhb research added.  ta ann holdings bhd ta ann holdings bhd, with its attractive dividend yield, high-growth businesses and undemanding valuation, is a top pick in 2016 for analysts. however, its first-quarter earnings were less than impressive, coming in below expectations of kenanga research plantation analyst voon yee ping and consensus, meeting only 11% and 9% of their core net profit estimates respectively. for the three months ended march 31, 2016 (1qfy16), ta ann posted a 53.7% decline in net profit to rm12.55 million on the back of a 1.6% decline in revenue to rm218.53 million. in a note to clients on may 20, voon said the company posted weak results in 1qfy16 due a 16% year-on-year (y-o-y) and an 8% y-o-y decline to us$221 (rm871) per cu m and us$469 per cu m in log and plywood prices respectively, compounded by weaker production volume (logs and plywood declined 33% and 14% respectively). when contacted, voon said ta anns share price was also impacted by the stronger ringgit at the start of the year and its weaker production volumes. year to date, the share price had declined by 20% to close at rm3.29 last friday, with a market capitalisation of rm1.46 billion. however, voon is optimistic about ta ann moving forward as the ringgit has weakened since then and timber prices are expected to pick up. the ringgit closed at 3.9457 to the us dollar last friday. the first quarter was the worst for the year [in terms of timber prices], but with the weakening ringgit and timber prices improving things would be better going forward, she said. for the long term, she said ta anns palm oil segment will boost its earnings as its young oil palms are coming into years of higher production. the trees are six to seven years old on average. so over the next few years, ta anns plantation segment will be a better driver of its earnings.  karex bhd karex bhd, the worlds largest condom manufacturer by volume which was seen as a strong beneficiary of the weak ringgit against the us dollar, saw its fortunes turn when the local currency strengthened this year as it reported a huge net foreign exchange loss of rm5 million for the third financial quarter ended march 31, 2016 (3qfy16). this dragged its net profit down by 37% to rm9.63 million from rm15.21 million a year ago. while affin hwang capital remains upbeat about karexs strategic expansion into the high-margin own brand manufacturing (obm) segment, it said the longer gestation period could keep costs elevated for the time being, keeping margins expansion in check. as such, in its may 30 note on karex, affin hwang capital revised its estimates on karex downwards by 14% to 18% for financial year ended june 30, 2016 (fy16) to fy18 after taking into account the slower-than-expected ramp-up in the obm segment, among others. still, the research firm expects 4qfy16 core net profit to normalise to the region of rm15 million to rm20 million on weaker ringgit, while latex prices have eased back to around rm4.50 from rm5. successful expansion into the obm segment would be a key rerating catalyst. however, valuations look rich for now, it said, maintaining its hold call on karex with a rm2.32 target price. year to date, karexs share price has fallen 16% from rm2.75 on dec 31, 2015 to rm2.30 last friday, with a market capitalisation of rm2.31 billion.  tiong nam logistics holdings bhd tiong nam logistics holdings bhd extended its positive earnings streak into the first three months of the year, with its net profit up 3% to rm36.55 million from rm35.55 million a year ago. the better quarterly profit helped push up full-year earnings by 9% to rm79.62 million for the financial year ended march 31, 2016 (fy16) from rm72.88 million in fy15. for fy17, ta securities analyst tan kam meng expects the groups net profit to grow faster and see double-digit rate of growth. he is projecting a 14% increase in net profit to rm90.9 million in fy17 on increased warehouse storage capacity, jump in property revenue from its pinetree residence project and new property sales of rm129.7 million. in a report dated june 7, tan was of the view that tiong nam, being the largest land transportation and warehouse owner in malaysia, was trading at an inexpensive price-earnings ratio of 4.9 times to calendar year 2017 earnings per share forecast. this is unjustifiable given its strong earnings growth prospect. in addition, the establishment of a real estate investment trust in the near run could free up the groups resources and enhance its balance sheet quality, he said, initiating coverage on tiong nam with a buy recommendation and a rm1.82 target price, which implies a 12% potential upside to its closing price of rm1.62 last friday. year to date, the counter has risen 18%. tan also believes that the current soft market condition has little impact on tiong nams property segment, which has been focusing on niche development. the property segment contributed 23% to the groups total revenue in fy16. it noted that tiong nam will also be immune to higher land cost as it already owns 25 warehouses and has 253 acres (102ha) of undeveloped land bank.  bumi armada bhd a victim of the slowdown in the oil and gas sector, bumi armada bhd saw its net profit fall 67% to rm23.43 million in the first quarter ended march 31, 2016 (1qfy16) from rm72.05 million a year ago, along with its revenue which dropped by 25% year-on-year to rm430.77 million. in a report dated june 1, maybank investment bank bhd (maybank ib) said the 1qfy16 results came in below the research houses and consensus initial financial year forecasts, prompting it to cut its fy16 to fy18 earnings for bumi armada by 3% to 30%. it expects bumi armadas earnings to remain weak in 2qfy16 and 3qfy16, owing to the absence of earnings from one of the companys floating production storage and offloading (fpso) units called armada claire (which saw its contract terminated in march) and lower conversion works. however, maybank ib sees a recovery from 4qfy16 onwards as bumi armada recognises profits from its four other vessels  fpso angola, fsu malta, fpso kraken and fpso madura. the research firm is keeping its buy call on bumi armada, with an unchanged target price of rm1.05, adding that any share price weakness following the 1qfy16 results is an opportunity to accumulate. year to date, bumi armadas share price has lost 26% to close at 75 sen last friday, with a market capitalisation of rm4.4 billion.  skp resources bhd skp resources bhd continued its earnings growth momentum in 1h16, posting an 88% jump in net profit to rm21.68 million for the fourth quarter ended march 31, 2016 (4qfy16). revenue also rose 18% to rm231.97 million during the quarter. for the full fy16, it saw net profit jump 94% to rm82.15 million, coming in within kenanga researchs expectations. in a note dated may 31, kenanga research analyst desmond chong said the plastic moulding companys long-term earnings prospects remained resilient anchored by two long-term contracts awarded by uk-based appliance manufacturer dyson ltd, with targeted sales contribution of rm1 billion per year on cordless vacuum cleaners. he is maintaining his outperform call on the stock, with a marginally lower target price of rm1.72 from rm1.76 previously. however, the brexit vote last month sparked concern about the prospect of skp resources on the sale of dyson products. the us is its biggest market, followed by japan in terms of sales and profits. still, an analyst who declined to be named said it is too early to gauge the impact of brexit on skp resources, adding that sales weakness from the european union would be made up by the growing demand for cordless vacuum cleaners in asia. compared with its closing price of rm1.31 on dec 31, 2015, skp resources share price has fallen by 6% to close at rm1.23 last friday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm1.44 billion."}, "110": {"date_posted": "18/7/2016", "title": " immediate support for maybank at rm7.98, says alliancedbs research

wise: brexit: gauging the contagion effect of brexit", "article": " this article first appeared in corporate, the edge malaysia weekly, on june 27 - july 3, 2016. while most analysts agree that malaysias fundamentals will not be significantly affected by britains withdrawal from the european union (brexit), many fear the spillover effects and inevitable uncertainties could weigh on the local economy and financial markets. nomura securities warned clients not to underestimate the depth and reach of financial market contagion to asia. in its note last friday, it says that taking the view that the financial and economic impact would only be limited to the uk due to its economic size is too simplistic for two reasons. first, we expect non-trivial spillover to the euro areas economy and financial markets. while the value of merchandise exports from the rest of the eu to the uk is only 3% of the rest of the eus gdp, the uks position as a global financial hub  the uk financial sectors assets account for more than eight times its gdp  leaves the rest of the eu much more exposed to the uk in terms of financial and investment linkages, in part reflecting the uks relatively liberalised domestic market and its strong legal framework and institutions, nomura says. secondly, it fears that brexit could further inflame anti-eu sentiment in other member states, increasing fears that they would also leave the union. asian equities and currencies tumbled last friday after 51.9% of the uk electorate voted to leave the eu the day before. the fbm klci declined 1.7% to 1,611 before recovering to 1,634. save for the south korean won, the ringgit was the hardest-hit among the major asian currencies, sliding 2.1% against the us dollar to 4.09. we believe that the overall implications of the vote to leave are negative for emerging currencies, particularly the central and eastern european currencies. in addition to this, currencies with large foreign portfolio exposure and wide external imbalances will also face large downside pressure. these currencies are also the most risk off currencies and include the indonesian rupiah, malaysian ringgit, turkish lira and brazilian real, writes hsbc global research in a recent report. nonetheless, the biggest victims of brexit appear to be the british pound and the uk and european markets. the pound took a pounding, depreciating 8% against the greenback while the euro stoxx and ftse lost 8.4% and 3.5% of their market value respectively in the first few hours of trading last friday. in contrast, us treasuries, the yen, the swiss franc and gold rose as investors flocked to safe-haven assets amid heightened market volatility. local brokers generally think that brexit will have a minimal impact on malaysia. hong leong investment bank in a june 24 report points out that malaysias trade with the uk amounted to only 1% of total exports while foreign direct investment from the uk in the 2008 to 2015 period averaged just 4% annually. hence, risk to malaysia emanates mainly from financial contagion. credit suisse in a recent note says only a handful of malaysian companies have significant exposure to the uk. indeed, only five companies in the fbm klci lost more than 2% of their market capitalisation last friday. out of the five, genting bhd, genting malaysia bhd and ytl corp bhd saw their shares decline 2.4% to 3.8%. the other two large caps are sapurakencana petroleum bhd and astro malaysia holdings bhd, which lost 4.3% and 3.8% of their market value respectively last friday. the increased market volatility we see today is due to the risk off sentiment, which dominates market sentiment following the brexit vote. as investors reverse their positions in risky assets and emerging markets, local bonds and equities and the ringgit will certainly be under selling pressure. meanwhile, we also saw the us and european stock index futures drop a few percentages, indicating that us and european shares are likely to fall when the markets open later, says areca capital ceo danny wong. that said, the selldown is just a knee-jerk reaction and is short term in nature. brexit would still require parliamentary approval and it could take up to two years to complete the process. positively, the odds of having two rate hikes this year are very low as the us fed turns more cautious on the outlook of the global economies. this is good news for emerging market equities, he adds. after the dust settles, investors will reassess the market situation and probably come back the asia  the only bright spot that offers decent growth in a low interest rate environment. the alternatives dont look attractive enough: us interest rates are too low while investors have largely turned more cautious towards european assets. therefore, the next couple of days could be a good time to capitalise on the brexit-induced share price weakness and accumulate blue-chip stocks such as tenaga nasional bhd or malayan banking bhd, wong concludes. the market turmoil is a natural flight to safety but its still too early to gauge the full impact. i think we have to wait and see how the us markets respond to brexit and how the asian markets respond to us shares on monday. so far, our local stock market has held up relatively well against its asian peers with the fbm klci still staying above 1,600. for instance, tokyo stock price index lost 8% and hang seng dropped 3% while fbm klci fell marginally by 0.4%. malaysian government securities saw yields rise but the amount was small, says etiqa insurance & takaful head of research chris eng. strategy-wise, watch the fbm klci on monday  after the us markets absorb the brexit news  on whether it can remain resilient and stay above 1,600. as the initial system shock from brexit subsides, and as the markets expect just one fed rate hike in 2016, i believe that the local stock market could gradually recover towards 4q. as such, if the index trades close to 1,600, its a pretty good entry point to accumulate stocks. however, if the index falls below 1,600, this will also set off another leg for a further fall, he adds. nonetheless, brexit is still a negative development for the global trade and economy. looking ahead, the further disintegration in the eu and the rise of populist politics are risks that investors need to watch out for. people shrugged off the possibility of rodrigo duterte becoming the president of the philippines, but it happened. then people thought that brexit was unlikely to materialise, but it happened. this november, we have the us presidential election and people dismiss the idea that populist candidate donald trump could be elected into office. if trump really becomes president of the us, this could have an adverse impact on global trades, economies and markets, eng concludes.  impact on sectors analysts do not expect brexit to directly impact malaysian banks as their exposure to the uk is very small. the uk-related loans of the largest bank, malayan banking bhd, amounted to rm1.27 billion as at end-march, or just 0.3% of total loans. cimb group holdings bhd, the second largest bank, had uk-related loans amounting to rm948 million, also just 0.3% of total loans. loans to the uk is really small, so i dont think therell be a direct impact. but there could be secondary effects, in that the banks may have exposure to companies that have high exposure to the uk, says a banking analyst with a local research brokerage. in a june 21 report, credit suisse notes a stronger british pound means higher ringgit revenue and profits (or vice versa), translated from the uk business units. ytl power international bhd leads the pack as some 24% of its revenue is derived from uk-based wessex water. the water and sewerage subsidiary in the uk contributes ~82% of ytl powers pre-tax earnings. this business will likely remain resilient after brexit. with over 40 casinos, genting malaysia is one of the largest casino operators in the uk. credit suisse estimates that genting malaysias uk operations will only contribute 2.5% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation in 2016e. genting is exposed to uk via its 49.3% stake in genting malaysia. the battersea power station project in the uk is owned by sime darby bhd and s p setia bhd (40% each), with the employees provident fund owning the remainder. a weaker economy will adversely affect the take-up in future property launches in the country. sime darbys property division will see associate profit contribution from battersea in the uk in fy2017. we estimate that battersea will make up about 11% of simes net profit. if the uk economy weakens, the worry is that future launches in battersea will be adversely impacted. the malaysian property market remains lacklustre, says credit suisse. the first phase is expected to be handed over progressively over a six-month period from december 2016 and the expected contribution to s p setias bottom line is about rm280 million, or 36% of consensus fy2017 estimates, it says. eco world development group bhd and eastern & oriental bhd have meaningful exposure to the uk as well. eco world international (ewi), in which the listed eco world will eventually hold a 30% stake upon its listing, has a huge exposure in the uk. as at january, ewi recorded u00a3712 million in property sales. e&o ventured to the uk in 2012 when it acquired princes house in central london. the project with an estimated gross development value of u00a360 million is slated for completion this year, in which revenue and profit will then be recognised. e&o recently aborted its proposal to list its uk-based property unit, e&o plc, on the london stock exchange. although the local bourses decline last friday was the smallest among the regions markets, the uncertainty over the global effects of brexit is likely to dampen investor sentiment in the coming weeks, until the dust settles and clarity emerges."}, "116": {"date_posted": "13/7/2016", "title": "digi gains 2.3% as 1h earnings within forecast", "article": " kuala lumpur (july 13): shares in digi.com bhd jumped as much as 11 sen

gained nine sen or 1.89% at rm4.84, after hitting a high of rm4.86 in the mid-morning trades. nearly 4 million shares were crossed between rm4.75 and rm4.86, making it the fifth top gainers across the

by still healthy postpaid revenue growth and sequential margin expansion in the second quarter of financial year 2016 (2q16). \"relative to peers, digi remains the telco with the least operational concerns in our view, although share price has already rebounded 10% from its recent trough,\" maybank ib research said. according to the research firm, digi's postpaid segment saw both subscriber gain and average revenue per user (arpu) growth in 2qfy16, as its products continue to gain traction. \"prepaid revenue meanwhile trended down sequentially, partly due to managements rationalisation of the international direct dial (idd) segment,\" it added. the firm said there was also an element of prepaid to postpaid migration. \"despite the potential threat from non-incumbents, management remains relatively sanguine about its 2hfy16 outlook,\" it said. the firm has retained its \"hold\" call, with an unchanged target price of rm5 on digi. digi posted a 9.4% fall in net profit in 2qfy16 to rm420.61 million or 5.41 sen per share, due to unrealised foreign exchange and derivatives losses of rm12.72 million. it posted a net profit of rm464.36 million or 5.97 sen per share a year ago. revenue also came in 3.9% lower at rm1.66 billion, from rm1.72 billion in 2qfy15. despite the lower quarterly earnings, digi declared a second interim dividend of 5.4 sen per share, amounting to rm420

listing is not an option it is formally considering at the moment, after a news report quoting people familiar with the matter stated that it was studying the matter as part of plans to become a pan-asian low-cost airline player. on monday, reuters reported that bursa malaysia-listed airasia was studying a dual listing in hong kong as it also moves towards setting up a joint venture (jv) in china. in any event, such an exercise could not be undertaken without the proposal being deliberated by the board of directors or without prior consideration of the various regulatory and commercial aspects of the matter. none of which has been undertaken thus far, airasia said in a filing with bursa after market close yesterday. airasia shares rose as much as 3.4% to hit an intraday high of rm2.72 yesterday, following the news report, before paring earlier gains to close at rm2.71, up eight sen or 3.04% from the previous days closing. year to date, airasias share price has more than doubled from rm1.27 on dec 31, 2015. airasia was the fourth most active counter on the bourse yesterday, with 37.36 million shares changing hands. on a potential jv in china, airasia told bursa that it does from time to time receive proposals to establish airline jvs in various jurisdictions. currently, airasia is not pursuing any new jv proposals as we continue to focus on launching airasia japan, as well as strengthening our existing joint-venture airline operations within asean and india, it said. it added that it will make the necessary disclosures to bursa on any material transaction or development relating to the airline. hong leong investment bank research analyst daniel wong said a dual listing in hong kong can help enhance liquidity in airasia shares, as well as benefit from the scale of and access to foreign capital. it would also be positive for airasias corporate branding as the hong kong stock exchange is known to have strict [listing] rules, he told the edge financial daily yesterday. currently, there are four airlines listed in hong kong: cathay pacific airways ltd, air china ltd, china southern airlines co ltd and china eastern airlines corp ltd. according to bloomberg data, china southern airlines has the highest price-earnings ratio (per) of 10.74 times, followed by china eastern airlines (10.17 times), air china (8.66 times), while cathay pacific trades at a much less demanding valuation of 7.67 times. shares in china eastern airlines are valued at hk$104.28 billion (rm53.57 billion), china southern airlines at hk$80.93 billion, air china at hk$105.52 billion and cathay pacific at hk$46.26 billion. airasia, meanwhile, has a per of 5.89 times, with a market capitalisation of rm7.54 billion as at yesterdays closing price. while it seemed that airline stocks can fetch better valuations on the hong kong exchange, maybank investment bank research aviation analyst mohshin aziz said: there is no hard evidence that it will be getting higher valuation, and there is no proven benefit. [a] dual listing requires a lot of effort with no guaranteed benefit. he pointed out that already, more than half of airasias shareholdings are owned by foreign investors, thus listing in malaysia is never an obstacle for foreign investors to invest in. airasia group chief executive officer tan sri tony fernandes said on his twitter feed on sunday that the airline was looking at more ancillary

taurx wager", "article": " this article first appeared in corporate, the edge malaysia weekly, on june 27 - july 3, 2016. as july draws near, all eyes will be on taurx pharmaceuticals ltd  in which genting bhd has a 20.7% stake  as it is expected to release the results of its phase 3 clinical trials on its experimental alzheimers drug next month. the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company is conducting research on treatment for the progressive brain disorder, which causes a slow decline in memory and currently has no cure. when contacted, a taurx spokesman declined to comment on the findings of the clinical trials but says news on the matter will be announced in a few weeks time. should the trials be successful, it will be good news for those suffering from the disease as well as genting and the other stakeholders of taurx. however, if the findings are positive but not enough to obtain the approval of the us food and drug administration (fda)  which is needed for the eventual commercialisation of the drug  will genting continue to invest in the research, or are there plans to list taurx or tie-up with new shareholders, industry observers wonder. previous news reports stated that taurx may go for an initial public offering (ipo), but industry sources say exploring tie-ups with large pharmaceutical groups could be a better business model instead, if more investments are needed. genting did not respond to emailed questions from the edge on the matter. on june 2, at gentings annual general meeting, the groups chairman and ceo tan sri lim kok thay said nothing has been decided by the taurx board and a decision would depend on the outcome of the clinical trials. he was commenting on news of the biopharmaceutical companys listing plans in the us. gaming analysts believe taurx is a potential winning catalyst for genting. but that catalyst will only materialise if the results of the trials are positive, or when genting can unlock the value of that investment, says a gaming analyst at a local research house that covers the stock. it has been a long-term bet u2026 it remains to be seen if anything will come out of it, he adds. nearly 14 years ago, in november 2002, genting announced a total investment of us$111.8 million in taurx in exchange for a 20% stake in the pharmaceutical company. singapores sovereign wealth fund, temasek, is also a substantial shareholder of taurx. uob kay hian, in a may 25 report, notes that while gentings management could not provide updates, its investment in taurx continues to be a wild card for the group. the outcome of taurxs phase 3 (final) clinical trials is expected to be known in 3q2016 and should the results be encouraging, taurx would be eyeing a nasdaq ipo in 2017 (with a potential valuation of us$15 billion), according to the wall street journal in dec 15 article. if so, gentings 20.7% stake would be worth rm12 billion and this could raise our target price to rm12.70, it states. the foreign research house currently has a target price of rm10.40 and a buy call on genting. the stock ended at rm8.19 last thursday. while things are unclear and subject to the outcome of taurxs clinical trials, what is certain is that this venture by genting is a long-term wager. according to the alzheimers association, from 2002 to 2012, only 244 drugs for alzheimers were tested in clinical trials. only one of the 244 drugs successfully completed clinical trials and went on to receive approval from the fda. many factors contribute to the difficulty of developing effective treatments for alzheimers. these factors include the high cost of drug development, the relatively long time needed to observe whether an investigational treatment affects disease progression, and the structure of the brain, which is protected by the blood-brain barrier, through which only very specialised small-molecule drugs can cross, it states on its website. it adds that none of the pharmacologic treatments (medications) available today for the disease slows or stops the damage and destruction of neurons that cause alzheimers symptoms and makes the disease fatal. the six drugs approved by the fda for the treatment of alzheimers temporarily improve symptoms by increasing the amount of chemicals called neurotransmitters in the brain, the association says. news reports note that as taurx is at the clinical development phase, it is still in the red with a loss before tax of us$13.23 million, and that gentings total investment cost in taurx is over rm480 million. apart from taurx, genting has invested in dnae group holdings ltd, a company incorporated in the uk that is involved in research and development on technologies for genetic analysis and sequencing. genting is also a major shareholder of dna electronics inc, a development-stage diagnostic company incorporated in the us that is involved in the development of a sample preparation system for the rapid isolation of bacterial and fungal pathogens directly from blood. none of gentings healthcare investments has contributed to its earnings as yet. the bulk of the groups earnings still come from its leisure and hospitality businesses. it is also in plantation, power, property and oil and gas. for the first quarter ended march 31 this year, genting saw its net profit fall 78.9% to rm130.83 million. the decrease was mainly due to lower earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) and the inclusion of gains on the disposal of available-for-sale financial assets and reversal of previously recognised impairment losses in 1q2015. in a may 25 report, maybank investment bank research says excluding exceptional items  which were largely due to unrealised net foreign exchange losses of rm280.9 million  1q2016 core net profit was down only 3% year on year to rm343.7 million. it adds that it believes the groups earnings for the second half of 2016 will be strong. at genting singapore, we expect doubtful debts to moderate from 3q2016 onwards on tighter credit policies (from 90 days to 30 days repayment terms). at genting plantations, we expect ffb (fresh fruit bunch) output to pick up sharply on seasonally higher rainfall. at genting malaysia, we expect more visitor arrivals, thanks to new amenities at resorts world genting. therefore, we leave our earnings forecasts for genting unchanged, despite the earnings shortfall in 1q2016, says the research house. maybank has a hold call on the stock with a target price of rm8.90. see also page 32: weighing the

appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on july 4 - 10, 2016. market practitioners around the world breathed a collective sigh of relief last week when some of the worst fears over the impact of the uks exit from the european union (eu) (brexit) began to fade, although they have not completely vanished. world oil prices and stock markets resumed their routines and recovered nearly all the losses suffered in the wake of the brexit vote on june 23. fund managers say the initial chaos in stock markets worldwide was a natural reaction, given that no one had expected the leave camp to secure victory. it was against our expectations that the british people would vote for brexit. the corresponding market reaction was well deserved. slower economic growth and the need for a cheaper and expanded monetary base translated into a weaker pound sterling. heightened uncertainty and the rush to safe havens saw a stronger us dollar, yen and rates in general. lower global growth translated into lower equities. all in all, markets were behaving as they should due to brexit, which is healthy but not profitable, affin hwang asset management bhd chief investment officer david ng tells the edge. what we were more worried about was the financial contagion as london is a major financial centre. thankfully, this did not happen, he says. the fbm klci was not spared from the market turmoil  it succumbed to investors panic following the vote, but staged a rebound last week. after seeing a decline of 0.67% to 1,629.52 points between june 23 and june 27, the index closed higher for three consecutive days last week. on july 1, it closed down 7.86 points or 0.48% to 1,646.22 from the day before. danny wong teck meng, ceo of areca capital sdn bhd, says the fast rebound proved that the malaysian stock market is resilient and that the knee-jerk reaction was because brexits negative impact had been overplayed. there isnt much of a direct impact of brexit on the malaysian equity market u2026 perhaps only for a few companies, which have direct links to the uk, he says. ng concurs, saying that any negative impact will be felt through the unwinding of the financial markets but not so much on a fundamental basis, given that malaysia is far from the epicentre of negative events. so net all, brexit is negative and markets have reset after the event. the impact should fade in the next few days or weeks. however, that does not mean that the malaysian market will take off as a result, as our local economic conditions remain weak, earnings outlook is poor and valuations are not compelling, ng explains. the immediate impact of the vote saw currencies such as the us dollar and yen appreciating on the back of their safe-haven status, while the pound sterling and euro tumbled. most emerging asian currencies rose last friday, with the ringgit closing up 0.76% at 3.9983 against the us dollar. such sharp currency movements will have a diverse effect on emerging markets, says bernard ching, head of research at alliancedbs research sdn bhd. he adds that the uncertainty of the post-brexit era will likely lead to more market interventions by central banks around the world in order to steady the ship. in particular, we believe this may alter the us federal reserves view on the pace of interest rate hikes, he says. with brexit adding a new element of uncertainty to global growth, many now expect bank negara malaysia to cut its overnight policy rate this year, thereby benefiting equities with more liquidity in the system. lower interest rates for a longer time is rapidly being factored into the market. this is, of course, good for yield-driven stocks such as real estate investment trusts (reits) and other dividend stocks, says ng. wong expects the banking sector to benefit from a rate cut as borrowing cost will trend lower or when there is further reduction in the statutory reserve requirement, which would help boost liquidity in the short term. he is also of the view that selected consumer stocks could benefit from lower interest rates as they would provide more spending power to consumers. nomura research has upgraded malaysias equity market to overweight after the brexit vote as the research house expects dimmer prospects for developed markets. the main reason for the upgrade is brexit. what brexit does is it changes the macroeconomic outlook. firstly, it reduces the prospects of developed markets. secondly, it reduces the prospect of policy tightening and in fact, it increases our expectations of policy easing, says mixo das, vice-president of nomura singapore ltd. das prefers yield stocks that have some element of growth. his stock picks include malayan banking bhd, ijm corp bhd, ihh healthcare bhd, tenaga nasional bhd (tnb) and karex bhd. in contrast, alliancedbs ching believes a defensive strategy is likely to outperform a growth strategy, given that markets are in a risk-off environment in the near term. we favour defensive banks such as public bank bhd and hong leong bank bhd, utilities such as tnb that have resilient earnings, and dividend yield stocks such as sunway reit and capitaland malaysia mall trust. for growth stocks, our top picks are gamuda bhd, skp resources bhd, muhibbah engineering (m) bhd and kimlun corp bhd. we advise investors to buy only on weakness. we maintain our end-2016 fbm klci target of 1,700 points, which implies 15.5 times 2017 per and is derived using a bottom-up valuation approach, says ching. kenanga research says in a report that exporters such as kossan rubber industries bhd, slp resources bhd, thong guan industries bhd and vitrox corp bhd may return to investors radar screen as the us dollar could appreciate further due to its safe-haven status. meanwhile, affin hwangs ng says malaysian automotive players, which are net importers, could also feel the pinch given that brexit has brought about a rise in the us dollar and yen. he adds that the auto sector had already been softening prior to brexit on the back of tighter hire-purchase approvals, elevated household debt and cautious spending. he opines that he would be cautious about malaysias property companies with exposure in the uk, unless there is a pick-up in sales. the property market there had already been softening prior to brexit. post-brexit, we have financial firms shifting their staff out, lower investment cycles, eu workers who are uncertain of their status in the uk and heightened volatility of the pound sterling  all these compounds the already oversupplied market, ng explains.

six-month extension of the price control & anti-profiteering regulations until end-december 2016 is neutral for oldtown, in our view. in the near term, we believe oldtown will maintain its current pricing strategy for: a) fmcg, since they continue to benefit from favourable raw material prices; and ii) f&b to gain market share. on a separate note, the impact of the minimum wage hike on july 1, 2016 on oldtown could be minimal as only about 100 staff members (out of a total staff force of 1,700 to 1,800) are currently paid below the new minimum wage. organic growth aside, we understand that oldtown is looking into potential mergers and acquisitions (m&a). a strong balance sheet and net cash position of rm154 million (as at end-march 2016) provide for such opportunities. as a recap, selection criteria include being complimentary to the existing business segments and within the supply chain. while m&a are on the drawing board, we believe risks could be limited by the size of the acquisition. we maintain our assumption of a 55% dividend payout ratio for now, but we do not rule out better-than-expected payouts, as it sits on a growing cash pile.  maybank ib research, july 1"},

lim wee chai is confident that top glove corp bhd will have another record-breaking year in the financial year ending aug 31, 2016 (fy16). in fact, the groups accumulated profit for the nine-month period ended may 30, 2016 (9mfy16) had already exceeded last years annual figure. however, the share price of the worlds largest rubber glove maker seems to contradict its stellar financial performance. top gloves share price has been on a downward slope, declining almost one-third since the start of the year. its share price has slid from its peak of rm6.94 in january to rm4.61 last friday. for the first nine months of this year, our net profit had already exceeded last years total, and we still have one more quarter to add to that. so, compared to last year, we will see at least 25% growth in terms of net profit. this year will be a record year for us, said lim, the single-largest shareholder holding a 29.44% stake in top glove at the financial results briefing on tuesday. lim expects a net profit growth of over 25% year-on-year in fy16, despite reporting lower-than-expected results for 3qfy16. in fy15, top glove achieved a record-high net profit of rm279.8 million, up 55% from rm180.5 million in fy14. its annual revenue grew 10% to rm2.51 billion from rm2.28 billion. for 3qfy16, its net profit fell 14% to rm63.5 million from rm72.7 million in the previous year. the group reported net profits of rm104.6 million and rm128.3 million for 2qfy16 and 1qfy16 respectively. analysts noted that the disappointing earnings figures for 3qfy16, which were released last week, had added to selling pressure on top glove shares, although most investment analysts, who track the stock, had it on their recommendation list. top glove shares are trading at a price-earnings ratio (per) in the mid-teen, which some quarters may view attractive. top gloves historical valuation at peak earnings averaged at between 23 and 27 times per, according to kenanga research. the per valuation of top glove is at 14.7 times, based on forecast earnings for fy17, which has lagged behind hartalega that is trading at about 20 times forecast earnings for the financial year ending march 31, 2017. we consider the underperformance unwarranted. the valuation gap should narrow when we consider that top glove has higher levels of total capacity and net profit compared to hartalega, commented kenanga research. nonetheless, maybank ib research, which has cut its earnings forecast, commented that the earnings figures for 3qfy16 were exceptionally weak and below expectations on a convergence of negative factors. the results are below expectations as we do not expect earnings to significantly strengthen in 4qfy16. the first interim dps (dividend per share) of six sen declared (versus eight sen in fy15) was below expectations, wrote maybank ib research in its review of top gloves financial earnings in 3qfy16, noting that the glove makers earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation margin has shrunk sharply to 14% from 18.3% a year ago. meanwhile, ta securities analyst wilson loo said: the group was making good profits in 4qfy15, 1qfy16 and 2qfy16, but a confluence of negative factors in 3qfy16, such as a weaker us dollar, [a] rise in natural latex prices and the natural gas price hike in january had profoundly affected their performance and affected the sentiment on the stock. also note that top glove has a very heavy latex product mix. with its natural latex procured [with] the ringgit, there was no natural hedge to rising latex prices in 3qfy16, loo added, noting that the good results seen in the first two financial quarters were boosted by a stronger us dollar during the period. however, he expects the group to perform better in the coming quarters, with the commencement of operations for an additional 28 lines it is adding to its f27 and f6 factories in port dickson, negeri sembilan, and phuket, thailand, respectively. the group will also complete its new factory, f30, in klang by february 2017. upon completion of the expansion exercise, the group will have an additional production capacity of 7.8 billion pieces per year, bringing its total capacity to rm52.4 billion. [the] next quarter will be better for top glove, as the group will have better plants and demand is expected to be healthy. however, there will be some impact due to a hike in the minimum wage effective july, as well as the natural gas cost hike, which could affect performance, said loo, adding that top gloves earnings are expected to normalise going forward."}, "122": {"date_posted":

payout for 2016 as the group has just done an equity placement and raised about s$11 million. however, given the largest shareholder, star medias, history of paying generous dividends, we expect cityneon to follow suit and pay out 20% of earnings from 2017 onwards. uob kay hian also increased its target price for cityneon to 85 singapore cents from 72 cents previously. our target price has an implied 13.1 times based on 2017 forward price-earnings, which is a 24.8% premium to what peers are trading at (10.5 times). we believe the premium is justified given cityneons low risk profile, strong growth profile, higher entry barriers, low payables risk as licensing fees and minimum guarantees are collected up front, and high return on equity versus peers, it says. if cityneon is able to secure additional ip rights for other franchises such as dc comics or star wars, we see further upside to our valuation. the company is star medias first venture into the events and exhibition industry. cityneon specialises in providing creative solutions in interior architecture, events, exhibitions and experiential environments. star media has another exhibition company called perfect livin that is parked under its i.star ideas factory sdn bhd. the event, exhibition, interior and thematic (eeit) business segment was the only segment that saw an increase in revenue. eeit revenue for the first quarter ended march 31 (1qfy2016) rose 10.3% to rm42.02 million compared with rm38.09 million a year earlier. as a result, the losses for the segment narrowed to rm1.76 million in 1qfy2016 from rm5.29 million in 1qfy2015. meanwhile, star media saw its overall earnings fall in 1qfy2016. net profit dipped 40% year on year (y-o-y) to rm14.8 million and revenue decreased 8.6% to rm198.73 million. the weak results were due to lower revenue from most of the groups business segments, in particular from the print segment, which saw its revenue drop 12.7% y-o-y due to lower advertising revenue. despite the lower earnings, the media group is still sitting on a healthy net cash position of rm333 million, which translates to 45.1 sen per share as at march 31. given this huge cash pile, analysts believe that star media can still dish out dividends. at its close of rm2.33 last friday, star media had an indicative dividend yield of 7.73%. the stocks 52-week closing high stood at rm2.47 on may 9, while its 52-week low was rm2.137 on aug 25, 2015. attractive dividend yields are likely to be maintained given a strong net cash position and minimal capex [capital expenditure] commitments, says maybank investment bank research in a may 25 report. advertising expenditure [adex] is expected to improve in 2016 with 5% y-o-y growth. major sporting events (summer olympics and uefa euro cup), anticipated to be held in mid-2016, will boost adex, it says. public investment bank research states in a may 25 report: we believe the group will be able to pay consistent dividends based on its strong net cash position. higher revenue contribution from cityneon is expected to mitigate the downside risks from the print segment. nevertheless, a lower margin from the eeit business segment may pose challenges to the groups earnings momentum moving forward. "}, "123": {"date_posted": "14/6/2016", "title": "analysts foresee dimmer prospects for sapurakencana", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on june 14, 2016.  kuala lumpur: investment analysts have turned even more cautious about sapurakencana petroleum bhds prospects after last fridays briefing. they slashed the oil and gas (o&g) giants earnings forecasts for three financial years, which in turn sparked selling of the stock yesterday. given the strong headwinds in the o&g industry, analysts cut sapurakencanas earnings forecasts for the financial year ending jan 31, 2017 (fy17) and fy18 by more than half. there are concerns that the group would not be able to replenish its order book as fast in the current downturn, in addition to daily charter rates (dcrs) of its oil rigs in decline that are eating into its earnings. sapurakencanas share price dropped nine sen or 5.5% to close at rm1.55 yesterday, bringing its year-to-date loss to 29.5%. it was one of the most actively traded counters on bursa malaysia with 41.02 million shares traded. uob kay hian research analyst kong ho meng opined that sapurakencanas order book replenishment remains a risk. in comparison with the rm10 billion revenue in fy16, the group has about rm7 billion in order book realisation slated for fy17, kong said, adding that the risk will be greater in fy18 if the group does not secure enough new contracts. according to him, sapurakencanas revenue realisation from its fy18 order book is currently worth rm3.9 billion, less than half of the fy16 level. kong reckoned that although oil prices had stabilised, contract wins will take a longer time to flow into the actual order book and to be realised as revenue. taking into account the groups order book burn rate, we cut our revenue forecast by 10% to 15%. we expect a more bullish replenishment of [its] fy18 order book at similar levels year-on-year, he added. meanwhile, midf research pointed out that it wouldnt be too conservative to estimate that sapurakencana will only manage to replenish an order book of between rm1 billion and rm2 billion a year for the next few years, given that large offshore jobs are scarce at this juncture. even if oil prices were to sustain at [the] current levels and possibly trade beyond us$50 (rm204) per barrel for a prolonged period, it is likely that the value of new projects, contracts and charter rates would see a significant decline in terms of value, compared to the glory days of us$100 oil, midf said. for fy16, sapurakencana sank into the red with a net loss of rm791.4 million, against a net profit of rm1.433 billion in the previous financial year. the losses were partly due to a massive provision of impairment amounting to rm2 billion for its property, plant and equipment, as well as o&g properties. revenue, however, was higher at rm10.18 billion, against rm9.94 billion the year before. in a note to clients yesterday, maybank investment bank research (maybank ib research) reduced sapurakencanas core profit forecasts for fy17, fy18 and fy19 by 87%, 85% and 20% respectively on dimmer operating prospects for its drilling, and engineering and construction (e&c) divisions. maybank ib research forecast sapurakencanas net profit to come in at rm108 million in fy17, significantly below the consensus forecast of rm837 million. we expect its e&c operations to see a bigger 25% fall in revenue in fy17. the shortfall will come on a 40% to 50% drop in pan malaysias transportation and installation works, and near absence of new fabrication works, maybank ib research analyst liaw thong jung said. meanwhile, the declining utilisation and dcrs also did not paint positive prospects for the groups rigs segment. on the utilisation rate of its rigs, liaw projected sapurakencanas overall utilisation for fy17 to fy19 to stand at 50%, 55%, 69% respectively, compared with previous projections of 68%, 72% and 72%. of the five rigs stacked since [the] fourth quarter [of] financial year 2016, three units are expected to be off-hire for the next 18 months, and two units may only see charters in [the] third quarter [of] financial year 2017, according to liaw. of the 11 rigs currently on-hire, five contracts will expire in fy17 and would see gaps in utilisation, should they be successfully extended, at lower dcrs, he added. liaw also sees dcrs continuing to be under pressure, and hence lowered forecasts for tender rigs to between us$70,000 and us$90,000, against us$120,000 to us$130,000 previously, while forecasts for semi-tender rigs have been revised to us$120,000 to us$150,000, from us$200,000 to us$250,000 previously. nonetheless, he pointed out that the groups loss-making energy operations, which are likely to remain in the red in fy17, could be the wild card and major swing factor that its share price has not fully priced in yet. unlocking value of its existing gas fields is high on its agenda, liaw said, noting that the group has secured the field development plan approval from petroliam nasional bhd for its sk310 b15 field, and the gas sales agreement is expected to be signed soon. ultimately, monetising these reserves is earnings- and net asset value-positive, of which the expected first gas production is by [the] end of fy18. we understand this field could produce 250 to 300 million standard cubic feet per day, liaw pointed out."}, "124": {"date_posted": "13/6/2016", "title": "is starbucks growth story enough for berjaya food?", "article": "  this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on june 13, 2016.  kuala lumpur: shares in berjaya food bhd (bfood), whose earnings halved in the fourth quarter ended april 30, 2016 (4qfy16) as announced last friday, have fallen by 19.3% to rm1.88 year-to-date, compared with a 3.03% drop in the benchmark fbm klci. just about one and a half years ago, bfood was trading at its all-time high of rm3.30 on nov 24, 2014, shortly after it completed the purchase of the remaining half of berjaya starbucks coffee company sdn bhd, which held the licence to develop and operate the starbucks coffee chain of cafes and retail stores in malaysia. however, its share price has been moving southwards since, as its modest earnings growth failed to meet expectations, exacerbated by earnings per share dilution after its share base was enlarged by some 20.5% as a result of warrants and an employees share option scheme conversion, according to kenanga research. despite the sharp drop in its share price, the stock still appears to be overvalued, with a trailing price-earnings ratio (per) of 30.9 times in comparison with its average five-year per of about 17 times. another operator of cafu00e9 outlets, oldtown bhd, has a much lower trailing per of 15.5 times. in 4qfy16, the groups net profit came in 50.6% lower at rm3.17 million, compared with rm6.41 million recorded in 4qfy15, despite a 7.9% revenue growth to rm139 million, from rm128.9 million previously  which primarily came from higher sales at existing cafes and new cafes. the group said the quarterly earnings decline was due to lower contribution from kenny rogers roasters (krr) operations in malaysia, as malaysian consumers became more cautious about their spending after the goods and services tax was implemented. the profit margin of berjaya starbucks was also hit by a steep depreciation of the ringgit, which crimped its starbucks operations profit margin. berjaya starbucks also had to fork out rm600,000 during the quarter to customs as additional import duty and sales tax on purchases from its principal over the past few years. thus, bfoods full-year (fy16) net profit was only rm22.9 million, significantly short of analysts expectations of between rm28 million and rm31.6 million. the groups total debts also stood near 20% higher at rm228.5 million as of april 30, 2016, compared with its total debts of rm191.1 million as at april 30, 2015. consequently, its net debt-to-equity ratio increased from 39.8% during the period. however, an analyst who declined to be named told the edge financial daily that the increase in borrowings is not a concern, given that the borrowings are channelled into the expansion of new cafu00e9 outlets. meanwhile, both maybank investment bank research and kenanga research have given a positive rating to bfood, with a target price of rm2.30 and rm2.35 respectively, citing starbucks growth story as the key driver of the groups earnings, prior to the release of its 4qfy16 results. according to maybank investment bank research analyst kevin wong, bfood is looking to start its fast-moving consumer goods (fmcg) business in july or august 2016, as management plans to roll out the fmcg business with expected shipments of about 76,000 bottles of coffee from the united states.  the coffee beverages, he said in a may 5 note, will be sold on a non-consignment basis to a distributor that has over 4,000 to 5,000 channels, including major hypermarkets and convenient stores. the long-term plan for this segment is to secure a manufacturer within the region that would enhance margins. as for kenanga research, its analyst soong wei siang said in a june 2 report that a restructuring exercise to rationalise krr, the main drag on bfoods earnings growth, could trigger a positive rerating of bfood as a pure starbucks play. we reckon that loss-making outlets that have slim hope of turnarounds should be closed down, and the group may also need to adopt [to a] new pricing strategy to improve the appeal of krr to its customers. should this anticipation materialise, we believe losses on krr will be narrowed, and bfood will be a more starbucks-concentrated f&b (food and beverage) company, soong said, adding that he does not rule out that bfood will dispose of krr if it gets the right price for it. so far, bfoods management and investors have continued to be bullish about starbucks growth potential. but the question of whether its growth is enough to sustain bfoods profitability remains, given the groups lacklustre fy16 results. nonetheless, at its current share price, one might still be tempted to park some money in, given the successful branding of starbucks as a sophisticated, urban and trendy coffee brand, as well as the strong brand loyalty it now commands."}, "125": {"date_posted": "10/6/2016", "title": "is ioi corp oversold?", "article": " this article first appeared in corporate, the edge malaysia weekly, on may 23 - 29, 2016. the roundtable on sustainable palm oils (rspo) certificate suspension of the entire supply chain of ioi corp bhds palm oil production is no doubt a bummer for the group. since the announcement on march 14, its share price has fallen from a year-to-date high of rm5 to a low of rm4.12, shedding a total of 17.6%. the counter did see some reprieve last week after it posted a fairly decent quarterly financial results, gaining 3.4% to rm4.26 last thursday. but by friday, it had shed four sen to rm4.22. given the weakness in ioi corps share price over the last few months, it raises the question of whether the counter has been oversold. notably, the employees provident fund (epf) has been actively selling its stake in the integrated palm oil group in the last few months. filings with bursa malaysia show that the epf had pared its stake to 7.22% stake as at may 16 from 8.81% on jan 5. filings also show that the lee family has been acquiring shares on the open market through its private vehicle, vertical capacity sdn bhd. between january and may, the family acquired about 10 million shares, increasing its stake to 46.97% from 46.66% previously. ioi corps share price rebounded slightly last week to close at rm4.26 on thursday after the group announced its financial results for the third quarter ended march 31, 2016 (3qfy2016). net profit for 3qfy2016 stood at rm748.4 million as compared with a net loss of rm188 million a year ago. revenue increased marginally to rm2.87 billion, up 4.6% from rm2.76 billion previously. over a nine-month cumulative period, net profit increased substantially to rm754.2 million from rm8.2 million a year ago. revenue increased 3.6% to rm8.92 billion from rm8.61 billion previously. the higher profit before tax is due mainly to the lower net foreign currency translation loss on foreign currency denominated borrowings and higher contribution from the resource-based manufacturing segment, says the group in its financial results report. nevertheless, most analysts covering the stock remain unmoved. bloomberg data shows that there are 14 sell calls, 10 hold (cimb investment bank research upgraded its call from sell) and one contrarian buy call by maybank investment bank research. the average 12-month target price among these analysts stands at rm4.03. many expect the companys resource-based manufacturing division to feel the pinch going forward, given that about two-thirds of its speciality oils and fats business is derived from europe and the us. in its may 10 report, maybank ib research says the integrated plantation group has one to 1u00bd months of certified sustainable palm oil inventory to weather the temporary rspo suspension. moving forward, we expect that the speciality oils and fats sub-segment will be impacted if measures to lift the suspension of the rspo certificates do not materialise. overall, 36% and 15% of ioi corps revenue in fy2015 was derived from europe and america respectively. according to its announcement, the group is expected to submit a quarterly progress report to the rspo by the end of may 2016, once the peer reviews of the high conservation values have been performed and the necessary action plans have been addressed, says bimb securities research in a report. but what is more worrying is that ioi corps major customers for its speciality oils and fats business, such as unilever, kellogg, mars and nestlu00e9, have announced that they will cease to source palm oil from it. would this mean a permanent cessation of business from these consumer product giants? ioi corp did not reply to the edges questions on plans for its european business in the light of the rspo suspension. in its report, maybank ib research says ioi corp believes that some 7.5% of its earnings before interest and tax, on an annualised basis, is at risk due to the rspo suspension. nonetheless, what is certain is that the shorter the suspension period, the lower the overall financial losses to ioi corp [will be], adds maybank ib research. recently, ioi corp instituted legal action against rspo, challenging the suspension. the company is arguing that the suspension should not take effect against its downstream operations and certified palm oil purchase and sales contracts that came prior to the suspension. despite the legal challenge, ioi corp says it is still committed to implementing the action plan, which is required for the lifting of the suspension. maybank ib research opines that the recent selldown due to the rspo suspension is overdone. meanwhile, cimb research believes that the decline in ioi corps share price following the suspension has priced in the concerns and sees share price support from a potential buyback exercise.

one trader says the fall has more to do with trading psychology than the 1q earnings not meeting investors expectations. he explains that although vivocom has a very powerful and potent story, its penny stock status makes it easier for speculators to go in for an easy kill. punters probably quickly built up their positions upon hearing rumours that the results would be fantastic, and took profit once the results came out. if you look at what they have done to their share base through various corporate exercises, the direction is somewhat speculative. although the companys market capitalisation is more than rm800 million, its share price is only 32 sen due to the unusually large share base that makes it a top volume stock. they have come to the equity market to raise funds and it looks like they will need to raise a lot more capital, thereby diluting the earnings of existing shareholders  we will never know when the share placement stops, says a fund manager. although the stock appears cheap based on a fy2017 per of a mere six times and the company has a good chinese fdi story due to its connections with china railway construction corp ltd (crcc), its execution risk and cash flow issues are real. as we have seen in the past, there were companies with nice stories that just failed to execute and deliver. unlike established big players like gamuda, ijm corp or suncon, vivocom has a relatively short track record, so the big discount in valuation probably reflects the level of risks, he adds. however, cimb research analyst marcus chan disagrees that vivocom is a speculative stock. the recent drop in its share price has little to do with the companys fundamentals. as one of the top 10 most active stocks, its a reflection of the change in retail sentiment, which is affected by mscis weightage rebalancing that unfortunately coincided with vivocoms earnings release. so, im not too worried. in fact, the price weakness provides institutional investors with a good entry point into its shares. interestingly, off-market transactions compiled by bloomberg show that 7.8 million vivocom shares worth rm2.5 million were transacted in block trades from may 17 to 19, which are typically executed by institutional investors. this works out to an average transaction price of 32 sen per share, close to its open market prices of 32-33 sen on these three days. when asked whether vivocom faces a perception issue inherited from instacom, chan says it is now a totally different animal compared with instacom as the management and shareholders have changed. he adds that the new team has delivered in terms of financial performance in the past five to six months. as for cash flow concerns, as we win more jobs we definitely need more working capital to fund these projects. as a rule of thumb, we need rm10 million in working capital for every rm100 million job. since our outstanding order book has expanded to rm1 billion and other contracts are being finalised in the coming months, we will need more funding, people and resources to execute the jobs and help us grow, explains executive director choo seng choon. if we go to banks for borrowings, we need to pay a high 7% to 8% interest rate, an expense that would eat into our profits. but if we are able to grow our earnings by 200%, a 10% dilution in earnings is not that significant an impact. additionally, we welcome institutional investors to be our long-term shareholders to balance out our large retail investor base, he says. according to bloomberg data, mutual fund filings show that institutional investors held an aggregate 3.6% equity interest in the company as at march 31. vivocom is eyeing a transfer to bursa malaysias main market by the middle of next year, after meeting the profit requirement in fy2016 and having the financial years accounts audited. in a may 12 note to clients, cimb research says the strong 1q results should allay investor concerns about vivocoms execution ability. it raised its target price for the stock to 78 sen from 67 sen. meanwhile, midf research, in a recent note, reiterates its positive stance on the construction sector with vivocom as one of its top picks. maybank ib research notes that brokers are generally bullish on the stock as the street is forecasting a three-year 153% eps cagr for fy2015 to fy2018 against the backdrop of a strong job pipeline. the research house opines that a key parameter to monitor is the value of new job wins, which is crucial to confirm the bullish expectations of the stock. "}, "127": {"date_posted": "8/6/2016", "title": "trade wise: what's brewing at oldtown?", "article": " this article first appeared in corporate, the edge malaysia weekly, on may 23 - 29, 2016.  after declining 16% this year, the valuation of oldtown bhd  a homegrown fast-moving consumer goods (fmcg) and food and beverage (f&b) player  is starting to look attractive again. in fact, its trailing price-earnings ratio (per) of 14 times is lower than that of some of its regional peers.  as at last wednesday, the stock had dropped to rm1.39 from its close of rm1.657 on jan 14, which put its per at 14.14 times. by comparison, singapore-listed fmcg company, breadtalk group ltd, was trading at 40.14 times and thailand-listed oishi group at 18.92 times. after stripping out oldtowns cash  the group was in a net cash position of rm137.5 million as at dec 31, 2015  its per stands at 10 times. according to bloomberg data, the company offers an indicative dividend yield of 4.3%. interestingly, the trading volume of oldtowns stock shot up at the beginning of last month. some 1.47 million shares changed hands on april 4, which was a 610% increase from the 206,800 shares traded on april 1. the 1.47 million shares also represented a steep rise from the 52-week average volume of 430,799 shares done. trading volume has since dropped with between 30,000 and 80,000 shares traded from may 11 to 18. the stock is cheap. it is one of the few stocks in the fmcg and f&b segment that are trading at a steep discount, says an analyst at a local banking group who covers the stock. there is no exact comparison for its business model and segment. however, compared with other players in the f&b and fmcg industry, oldtowns valuations are attractive, he adds. oldtown started out manufacturing coffee and other beverages, including instant coffee mix and instant milk tea mix, and marketing these locally and in 13 foreign markets. in 2005, it ventured into operating cafu00e9s and as at dec 31, 2015, had 245 of them in malaysia, singapore, indonesia, china and australia. in the meantime, breadtalk has f&b brands such as toast box, din tai fung, bread society and carls junior in its stable while oishi group is involved in the japanese restaurant business and beverage market through brands that include oishi, fruito and sparkling green tea.  potential catalysts and headwinds analysts say a potential catalyst for oldtown is the possibility of a special dividend sweetener or an m&a exercise, given its cash pile. management is considering declaring a special dividend to reward its shareholders. at the present time, we have estimated a dps of six sen, which provides a 4% yield. a potential special dividend of three sen per share could raise its yield to 6%. we are comfortable that its current net cash position of rm137 million (30.5 sen per share) will be sufficient for the group to meet both potential special dividends and m&a activities, says alliance dbs research in a feb 29 report. although its f&b operation remains challenging, we understand that the business is stabilising and should improve q-o-q. at the same time, management is actively pursuing m&a opportunities to enhance its growth prospects. thus, we will not be surprised if the group announced an acquisition this year. given that oldtown is likely to finance its acquisition with internal funds and the current challenging operating environment favours industry consolidation, we are positive any potential m&a exercise will be earnings accretive for the group, the report adds. the local research house has a buy call on the stock and a target price of rm1.70. sources say oldtown recently engaged investment bankers to help the group look at undertaking a corporate exercise that could potentially include the entry of a new substantial shareholder or even a privatisation exercise. however, oldtown did not respond to questions sent by the edge on the matter. an analyst contacted by the edge notes that like most companies in the sector, oldtown is not sheltered from headwinds such as weak consumer sentiment and rising costs. the group is aware of the challenges and is putting in place a number of things to help it ride out the storm. for example, it is looking at cost savings on its f&b side, such as consolidating its plants. this exercise is expected to bring about more than 30% cost savings, he says. maybank investment bank research has maintained its hold call on the stock and recently trimmed its target price by five sen to rm1.40. assuming slower fmcg sales recovery in the china market and possibly weaker domestic f&b operations on general weaker consumer demand and higher operating costs, we lower our earnings forecasts by 4%/7%/3% for fy16/17/18 respectively, it states in a feb 29 report. it adds that there may be several new developments this year that could affect oldtown and the f&b industry as a whole. these include the monthly minimum wage rising to rm1,000 from rm900 in july in the peninsula and to rm920 from rm800 in sabah and sarawak. however, the impact on oldtown could be minimal as only about 100 employees [out of a total workforce of 1,700 to 1,800] are being paid less than the new minimum wage currently, the maybank ib report says. higher foreign worker levies, although deferred, are another risk to earnings with an estimated 60% to 70% of oldtowns total workforce comprising foreigners. to mitigate the effect of such new regulations, oldtown may consider converting some of its cafu00e9s into semi self-service. this will help reduce its labour cost. in its financial year ended march 31, 2015 (fy2015), the groups total revenue rose just 2% year on year to rm397.7 million while net profit fell 2.9% to rm47.5 million. oldtowns earnings are still on a downward trend. in its nine months ended dec 31, 2015, the group saw revenue dip 3.9% y-o-y to rm288.9 million while net profit fell 11.8% to rm34.2 million, partly due to an increase in tax expenses.  net profit margins have also been narrowing, from 14.09% in fy2011 to 11.86% in december 2015. oldtowns cafu00e9 business used to be its main source of revenue,

and the quantum of spectrum fees will be announced (potentially mid-2016). gearing is a concern, and there is a downside risk to dividends. nevertheless, most of these negatives are priced in, with maxis being the worst-performing telco year to date. we maintain a hold rating with a lower tp of rm5.90. maxis has had to cut dividends since 2015 in order to manage its gearing (gearing is high due to years of sustaining dividends above free cash flow). with the impending 900/1800mhz spectrum payments, maxis net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) would likely climb above managements internal two times limit. while this is not yet an impediment to maxis raising new debt, the dividend risk would undoubtedly be skewed to the downside. we cut our financial year 2017 (fy17)/fy18 dividend per share forecasts to 20 sen (from 25 sen). the first quarter ended march 31, 2016 (1qfy16) was a fairly routine quarter for maxis, with both ebitda and net profit coming in within our and consensus forecasts. the real litmus test, however, lies in 2qfy16, when the impact from the recent post-paid pricing debacle will show (minimal subscriber loss would be deemed a positive surprise by the market). its weighted average cost of capital (wacc) should rise in lieu of gearing and dividend concerns, as this follows that maxis cost of equity should trend higher, and the stock would de-rate. we have lowered our tp to rm5.90 (from rm6.60) to reflect a higher wacc (from 6.7% previously to 7.1% due to an increase in beta from 0.8 times to 1.0 times). this has not yet taken into account the 900/1800mhz spectrum fee. our tp is based on a discounted cash flow, assuming 7.1% wacc and 2% long-term growth.  maybank investment bank research, june 6"}, "130":

[y-o-y]). on a y-o-y basis, net income growth was decent at 8.1%, underpinned by higher net fund-based income (+11.9% y-o-y), while non-fund-based income was flat with a growth of -0.2% y-o-y. operating expenditure was controlled with a growth of +5.3% y-o-y, which resulted in a positive jaw ratio of 2.8% in the first quarter of financial year 2016 (1qfy16). however, provisions for loan impairment were higher by 248.8% y-o-y, due to higher collective impairment allowance and lower recoveries. the groups gross impaired loan ratio rose to 2.11% from 1.86% in the preceding quarter. 1qfy16 net profit came in within expectations, accounting for 20.7% of our and 21.2% of the consensus estimates. the group was behind its fy16 key performance indicator targets for return on equity (roe), loan and deposit growth. the groups loan growth decelerated and was behind its target of 8% to 9% for fy16. this was also the case for its deposit growth, which fell behind its growth target of 10% to 11%. meanwhile, its annualised roe of 9.3% was lower than our expectation of 11.6% for fy16. recall that deposit campaigns were carried out in 4qfy15 in its key markets (malaysia, indonesia and singapore), which caused its net interest margin (nim) to be contracted by nine basis points (bps) q-o-q to 2.29% in 4qfy15. in 1qfy16, its nim improved 5bps q-o-q to 2.34%. this was contributed by the repricing of loans in malaysia. deposit competition is expected to continue to be stiff in malaysia. in view that the growth in total deposits and its current and savings account ratio (casa) locally have declined significantly to -1% and -2.7% y-o-y respectively, competition for deposits is likely to remain keen with rates continuing to be competitive to defend its deposit base. the groups gross lift-to-drag (ld) ratio eased to 89.9%, due to lower ld ratios in malaysia and singapore of 90.2% and 80.3% respectively. the slowdown in loan growth in key markets than deposit growth in malaysia and singapore led to an overall decline in the groups gross ld ratio. the groups liquidity coverage ratio was 141% versus 148% as at end-4qfy15, higher than the regulatory requirement of 70% by jan 1, 2016. compared to the preceding quarter, deposit growth in malaysia and singapore picked up pace to +5.6% and +16.7% y-o-y respectively, while that in indonesia slowed down to +10% y-o-y. in singapore, growth in deposits was driven mainly by fixed deposits (fds), while in indonesia, expansion of deposits was supported by growth in savings deposits and fds. the groups casa ratio slipped slightly to 33.3%, contributed by lower casa ratios in malaysia and singapore, while that of indonesia improved. while impaired loans rose for both domestic and international loans, impaired overseas loans contributed more to the increase. on a y-o-y basis, singapore, hong kong and indonesia were the highest in terms of contribution to the rise in overseas impaired loans. the significant rise in impaired loss in singapore was due to restructuring and rescheduling of loans to the oil and gas (o&g), shipping and manufacturing sectors, which although were still performing loans, there remains a lack of clarity ahead if the cash flow positions of these loans can improve in six months time in order to reclassify the loans back as performing, hence a write-back of provisions. this is in view that commodity prices may continue to be volatile, with global economic conditions remaining slow, hence continuing to impact the cash flows of borrowers in the o&g sector, and shipping companies related to commodities. we roll over our valuations to fy17. we downgrade the stock to neutral (from buy), with a revised tp of rm8.70 (previously rm9.80) by ascribing a lower price-to-book value

although they briefly trimmed gains on yellen's remarks, u.s. stocks ended higher and the s&p 500 capped off its strongest week since march. msci's all-country world stock index had its best weekly performance since mid-april, it said. alliancedbs research in its evening last friday said that despite the up close in the preceding day, the fbm klci had on may 27 traded within previous days range to form an inside day bar as market participants chose to be conservative in their game play. it said that in the absence of stronger selling interest, the benchmark index was in the green throughout most of the trading sessions before settling at the days high of 1,637.19 (up 6.10 points or 0.37%) in the last few minutes buying of selective blue chip stocks. in the broader market, gainers outnumbered losers with 403 stocks ending higher and 390 stocks finishing lower. that gave a market breadth of 1.03 indicating the bulls were in control, it said. alliancedbs research said the inside day bar indicated a pause in the game play with buyers and sellers seen in a balanced position. market participants basically saw no good reason to part their investible money without clearer technical evidence. given the 3 consecutive days of up close, buyers are expected to buy into the market when they can identify a change in the market pattern which can offer them an advantage.

development value (gdv) for the project will be subject to the development order approval and mutual agreement of the parties,\" it told the exchange. in return, tm said it is entitled to 5% of the gdv, as well as receive from sqsb a guaranteed land cost of rm150 million. tm will net rm114.1 million or three sen per share gains from the proposal. on earnings, uem sunrise's 1qfy16 net profit plunged 94.3% to rm3.02 million or 0.07 sen per share from rm53.14 million or 1.17 sen per share, dragged down by lower profit from operations, higher finance cost and lower contribution from associates and joint venture. revenue was 38.3% lower at rm257.75 million from rm417.45 million previously, due to reduction in property development sales in the southern region. wct holdings bhd, which intends to launch a real estate investment trust (reit) by this year, said it will list its reit by the first or the second quarter of 2017. subsequently, the construction and property developer will be looking at floating its engineering and construction division. \"wct will put bandar bukit tinggi mall and paradigm mall, which are collectively valued at rm1.2 billion, into the reit,\" said wct chairman datuk captain ahmad sufian. wct general manager, corporate and finance chong kian fah said the group is also considering injecting gateway @ klia2 into the reit later. currently, wct's tender book stood at rm10 billion, of which rm5 billion has been submitted, and rm5 billion is under preparation. it aims to secure at least rm2 billion worth of projects from the jobs it is bidding for. its outstanding construction order book stood at rm4.4 billion, mostly from projects in malaysia. ihh healthcare bhd has earmarked rm4.83 billion until 2018 as part of its global expansion, which includes an additional 3,000 beds in the near term. \"the company was focusing on growing in china, india and turkey,\" said ihh managing director and chief executive officer (ceo) dr tan see leng, adding 70% of the group's targeted expansion next year would be in china, where the emphasis would be in hong kong and shanghai. \"in india, ihh planned to become a leading healthcare provider in bangalore, hyderabad, chennai and bombay,\" he shared. on turkey, he said ihh intends to open a 325-bed hospital in istanbul in early 2017. despite global headwinds and volatile currency exchange rates, tan said ihh is not slowing its expansion. ammb holdings bhd's net profit dropped 46% to rm280.2 million in its fourth quarter ended march 31, 2016 (4qfy16) from rm519.22 million a year earlier

quarterly earnings also dragged its annual net profit to rm1.3 billion from rm1.92 billion a year earlier. revenue fell to rm8.42 billion compared with rm9.14 billion. despite the lower earnings, it plans to pay a dividend of 10.5 sen a share for the quarter in review, bringing full-year dividends to 15.5 sen a share. looking ahead, ammb said it was mindful of potential slower growth in the malaysian banking sector. \"the banking sector is poised to experience slower growth, as the economy expands at a more moderate pace and subdued business sentiment. despite the potential headwinds in the economy, there are still some bright spots and opportunities, such as the sme sector which has consistently outpaced the gdp growth since 2005, and still has room for growth,\" said ammb. malayan banking bhd (maybank) posted a 16.1% decline in net profit for the first quarter ended march 31, 2016 (1qfy16) to rm1.43 billion from rm1.7 billion a year earlier, though revenue climbed 21.8% to rm11.18 billion from rm9.18 billion a year earlier. it told the stock exchange that the increase in provisioning was primarily owing to the rise in number of corporate loans undergoing restructuring and rescheduling of their repayment to better match their projected cash flows, arising from the subdued operating environment. the banking group said all key business sectors registered higher net operating income in the quarter, led by group global banking (+21.1% y-o-y), group community financial services (+12.4%) and group insurance & takaful (+8.4%). \"many challenges in the business

lower earnings was due to lower utilisation of vessels recorded by its marine assets segment, which incurred a bigger loss before taxation of rm8 million compared with rm3.2 million in 1qfy15. revenue was nearly 5% lower at rm113.23 million against rm119.07 million previously, petra energy told the stock exchange in a filing today. going forward, petra energy said the business outlook for the oil

with anticipation of an increase in crude palm oil and palm kernel prices. it also targets a fresh fruit brunch production of 415,000 metric tonnes for the current financial year. appasia bhd has inked a memorandum of understanding (mou) with a china-based company and datuk mohd nazifuddin najib, son of prime minister datuk seri najib razak, to develop a big data opportunity in the asean and australasia region. the mobile app and it security service provider told the stock exchange that the mou is for the development and promotion of appasia's business to business to customer (b2b2c)

62% fibonacci retracement (fr) level of 1,728.54 to a recent high of 1,729.13 on april 14, 2016. very heavy liquidation at that level had caused the index to decline and move into a downward phase for its 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages (smas) with a dead cross on its short-term daily chart. the indexs price bars are now below the 50-day and 200-day daily smas and this depicts a downward phase for the fbm klci in the medium to longer term. medium- to longer-term prospects look bleaker as the weekly 50-day and 200-day smas also issued a dead cross in november 2015. any bargain hunting on the index will be met by heavy longer-term selling on rallies. the indexs daily signals are mixed, with its commodity channel index (cci), directional movement index (dmi) and oscillator all

liquidation activities. due to the very weak tone for the fbm klci, we are recommending a chart sell on umw holdings bhd (umw). the company manufactures light and heavy equipment for industrial, construction and agricultural sectors. it also imports, assembles and markets passenger and commercial vehicles, and related spare parts, as well as has interests in the oil and gas industries. a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that 17 research houses cover this stock, with four hold and 13 sell calls. maybank investment bank bhd covers umw on a fundamental basis, with a sell call and a sum-of-parts target price of rm4.50. its subsidiary, umw toyota motor sdn bhd, recently confirmed plans to build a new rm2 billion plant in bukit raja, klang. given the high capital expenditure for this plant, this foray could weaken umws stretched balance sheet at 55% net gearing even further.   umws chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is firmly down. from a weekly wave 5 and all-time high of rm14.23 (may 2013), its prices have plunged 64.9% on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames to a weekly wave 3 low of rm5 (may 2016). as prices broke above their recent key critical support levels of rm6.25 and rm6.54, look to sell umw on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term downtrend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, oscillator and stochastic) have issued clear sell signals and now show firm and obvious indications of umws eventual plunge towards much lower

at 1,595, 1,611 and 1,621, while very heavy liquidation at the resistance areas of 1,633, 1,700 and 1,729 will cap the indexs rise. the daily downside targets for the index are located at 1,569 and

consensus reveals that three research houses cover this stock, with a buy, a hold and a sell call each. maybank investment bank bhd does not cover naim on a fundamental basis. naims chart trend on the daily, weekly and and monthly time frames is firmly down. from a monthly wave c high of rm4.51 (may 2013), its prices have plunged 56.3% on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames to a daily wave 3 low of rm1.91 (may 2016). as prices broke above their recent key critical support levels of rm2.24 and rm2.42, look to sell naim on any rallies to its resistance areas, as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term downtrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, oscillator and stochastic) have issued clear sell signals and now show firm and obvious indications of naims eventual plunge towards much lower levels. it would attract very weak buying activities at the support levels of rm1.60, rm1.70, and rm1.91. we expect naim to witness very heavy activities at its resistance levels of rm1.92, rm2.24 and rm2.42. its clear downside targets are located at rm1.81, rm1.31, rm1.24, rm1.16 and rm0.83.  lee cheng hooi is the regional

distracted by negative newsflow on mahb", "article": " this article first appeared in corporate, the edge malaysia weekly, on april 18 - 24, 2016.  malaysia airport holdings bhd (mahb) appears to have a lot on its plate of late. judging from the newsflow, mahb is busy with issues ranging from a faulty aerotrain that connects the kuala lumpur international airport (klia) to the satellite building, to key customers pulling out of its main terminal. just last week, a rm456 million arbitration notice from a fuelling service provider was unexpectedly sprung on the airport operator. that came before the dust has settled on the sudden announcement of a hike in avaiation fees by the department of civil aviation. amid the noise, investors have remained unmoved. mahbs share price has been well supported, regaining most of the value lost in the global equities selldown last august. this year alone, the share price has climbed 19.07% to last fridays close of rm6.68, for a market capitalisation of rm11.08 billion. analysts ratings on the stock are evenly split between buy, sell and hold calls while 12-month target prices fall within a wide range of rm6.05 to rm6.57, according to bloomberg data. most dismiss the negative newsflow so far as non-events. analysts say developments within the domestic aviation industry could add to uncertainty but would not derail mahb from meeting the key performance targets set for its financial year ending dec 31, 2016 (fy2016) or its long-term performance. for fy2016, the airport operator wants to achieve earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) of rm1.72 billion, an improvement from 2015s rm1.57 billion. at the same time, passenger traffic of its malaysia operations is expected to grow to 86 million, or 2.5% above last years passenger numbers, while the turkish operations should continue to register double-digit growth in 2016. mahbs fy2016 targets have come after what some would consider a lacklustre fy2015. the consolidation of the operations of istanbul sabiha gokcen airport (isg) last year led to core losses of rm3.6 million due to non-cash amortisation cost of rm182.2 million being recognised. mohshin aziz, an analyst from maybank ib research who has a sell call on mahb, says in a feb 18 note that the outlook for the company is uninspiring, citing lacklustre traffic growth and rising costs. its earnings growth outlook is uninspiring when compared against its own history. mahb was churning core net profit of rm400 million to rm500 million per annum prior to the completion of klia2 and acquisition of isg. we forecast that it will take mahb another two to three years for its core net profit to revert to the rm400 million to rm500 million per annum levels, he writes. others who are more sanguine say mahbs targets seem modest, and are neither a tall order nor a re-rating catalyst, as one analyst puts it. but the conservative projections do reflect the airport operators appreciation of the subtle shift in the aviation industry and more subdued global macroeconomic environment. the restructuring of malaysia airlines bhd (mab) and its unilateral capacity rationalisation seems to have had destabilising effects on mahbs passenger growth numbers. the national airline accounted for 27% of mahbs passenger movements in 2015. in fy2015, passenger movements at klias main terminal fell 9.2% to 22.6 million passengers (international passengers fell 7.4% and domestic, 14.9%). this was cushioned by passenger traffic at klia2, which rose 9.5% to 26.3 million last year. the trend has continued to 1q2016, with passenger traffic at klia falling 10.8%. however, passenger traffic in malaysia still grew 3.4% and overall passenger traffic for mahb (including its turkish operations) rose 6.9%. coupled with news that lufthansa (europes largest airline by passenger numbers) has pulled out of klia and of air frances termination of its paris-kuala lumpur route, some quarters fear the declining passenger numbers at klia is a sign that the countrys largest airport is falling behind its regional peers. already, thailands don mueang international airport has overtaken klia2 as the regions busiest low-cost carrier airport. hong leong investment research analyst daniel wong tells the edge that the mab effect will normalise in the second half of the year. passenger traffic numbers should improve in 2h2016 as malindo air moves to klia. the partnership between mab and emirates should also increase klias connectivity to europe and the middle east and boost passenger numbers again. an industry expert explains, malindo air has very exciting plans after moving to klia. it has launched new international routes and has plans for code-sharing agreements to expand its reach. this is positive for mahb because the main terminal commands higher charges and connectivity improves passenger traffic. lufthansa and air france are pulling out for their own reasons. europe accounts for 4% to 5% of mahbs total passenger movement in 2015. it will decline to around 3% due to recent developments but traffic to and from the middle east (at 7.6% in 2015) should make up for it with the mab-emirates tie-up, he adds. further, existing customers like british airways and turkish airlines are expected to increase frequencies in mid-2016. this should prove to be reassuring for investors. it is also comforting to note that klia does not shoulder the responsibility of driving passenger traffic alone. mahb has been working towards growing the prominence of its secondary international airports at penang, kota kinabalu, kuching and langkawi as international gateways. collectively, these airports account for 5.6% and 4.1% of the passenger traffic of mahbs malaysian and overall airport operations respectively in 2015. we are beginning to see a slight shift in mahbs approach, plugging leakages in traffic. over the last year, it has been trying to improve connectivity in secondary hubs, getting more airlines to ply international routes without going through klia. international routes are more lucrative whereas domestic routes are somewhat subsidised, says an analyst. opening the secondary airports up will probably upset the domestic duopoly of airasia and mab. but, it will be beneficial to mahb and the industrys growth, he adds. the penang international airport and the kota kinabalu international airport have both undergone upgrades and are now seeing increased international connectivity. it is understood that as many as four new foreign airlines will start flying out of kota kinabalu this year. meanwhile, the airasia group has opted to develop langkawi as its sixth hub, with direct flights to guangzhou and hong kong already launched. the newsflow lately can be a distraction but i think that things will improve towards 2h16. i have a buy on the company. to me, what is important is that the company has strong cash flow that covers its operating expenditure and capital expenditure, and meet its dividend commitments to shareholders. mahb has always done that, says wong.

24, 2016. with the bank of japan pursuing negative interest rates in january, joining its counterparts in the eurozone and switzerland in slashing interest rates below zero, investors were forced to choose between accepting potentially negative returns or allocating capital to riskier assets. according to bloomberg, more than us$7 trillion or 29% of global developed sovereign bonds offer yields below zero, meaning investors who buy the bonds and hold them to maturity will not get all their money back. negative interest rates in europe and japan, coupled with the dovish stance adopted by the us federal reserve, seem to have lifted risk appetite and driven liquidity to emerging markets, including malaysia. year to date, the msci ac asia ex-japan index has seen a rebound of 2.1% while the fbm klci is up 1.3%, thanks to a gradual recovery in oil prices from a multi-year low in january (see chart 1). indeed, midf researchs fund flow report shows that foreign investors have turned net buyers of malaysian equities with a cumulative year-to-date net inflow of rm5.9 billion, albeit relatively low compared with the net outflow of rm19.5 billion for the whole of 2015. over in the bond market, foreign investors purchased rm11.5 billion of ringgit debt securities in march, driving the five-year malaysian government securities (mgs) yield further down to 3.4% from a one-year high of 4.1% last august. one of the prime beneficiaries of falling mgs yields are perhaps malaysian real estate investment trusts (mreits), which offer higher yields of 5% to 8% compared with those offered by government bonds. specifically, retail reits with strong underlying assets such as igb reit (high occupancy rate), as well as pavilion reit and sunway reit (visible acquisition pipeline) have fared pretty well  their unit prices are up 12% to 16% year to date. looking ahead, analysts opine that mreits will continue to benefit from the fall in mgs yields if there are further delays in fed policy rate hikes. mreits are certainly not the sole beneficiary. as shown in chart 2, large caps led the pack in terms of share price performance in the first quarter of the year (1q2016) with a 1.5% gain, beating mid caps 1.2% increase and a negative return of 1.4% seen by small caps. based on various sectors performance in 1q2016, it seems that although investors have turned bullish, they are selective when it comes to stock picking and they go for three things  blue chips, defensive earnings and cheap valuation. conglomerates were obviously the big winners (see chart 3). genting bhd saw a 33.5% surge in its share price  a rare performance that has not been seen since 2013  while hap seng consolidated bhd was up more than 20% to an all-time high of rm7.75 in march. tenaga nasional bhd, the second largest bursa malaysia-listed company by market capitalisation, rose 4.7% in 1q2016. one of the largest vertically integrated utilities in asia, the state-controlled firm is the top pick of many analysts with its 2016 earnings before interest and taxes (ebit) expected to rise to rm8.6 billion, double the level six years ago. for banks, now trading at 2008 financial crisis valuations, asset quality and size seemed to be the share price drivers in 1q2016. hong leong financial group bhd and alliance financial group bhd, two cheaper banks with the lowest gross impaired loan ratios after public bank bhd, gained 16.6% and 11.2% respectively. meanwhile, the share prices of the countrys two largest banks by assets, malayan banking bhd and cimb bank bhd, were also up by about 7%. developers, which are also trading at trough valuations, have fared fairly well too. ioi properties group bhd and sunway bhd, two of the countrys largest property developers, saw their share prices rise 20.2% and 12.3% respectively in 1q2016. the share prices of smaller players such as mkh bhd, matrix concepts holdings bhd and lbs bina group bhd also gained between 2% and 12%, thanks in part to their affordable housing focus. in contrast, export-oriented technology stocks and glove makers were hit hardest by the increased confidence in the ringgit, losing some 22.2% and 12% respectively of their market value in the first quarter. while there have been no signs of weakening earnings thus far, the real test lies in the upcoming 1q2016 quarterly results  to be released next month  which will capture the impact of the stronger ringgit. investors should keep a close eye on companies with resilient external demand as much of the negative sentiments may have already been priced into their current share prices. even in the first few weeks of 2q2016, many of the best-performing large caps continued their upward march. while bulls cite cheap valuations and further monetary easing by major central banks as reasons to be bullish, bears say earnings are still seeing downward pressure amid the volatile markets. this begs the question, is the perfect storm finally over or is it simply a dead cat bounce? in a recent note to clients, cimb research says the us dollar could be the key that determines the performance of global equity and commodity markets this year. the research house is of the view that the recent strengthening of asian currencies such as the ringgit is only a short-term rebound. the us dollar, which has been trading sideways in the past year, could consolidate for another few months before experiencing a strong and sharp rally in the second half of 2016. the bullish multi-year super cycle of the us dollar is not likely to end anytime soon. but analysts recommend taking a shorter investment horizon and keeping an eye on the greenback amid heightened market volatility, which came about due to the contest between cheap money and weaker earnings. other analysts advocate overweighting cash to take advantage of any volatility that creates a once-in-a-decade opportunity to accumulate quality assets at attractive prices. in the meantime, all eyes will be on the feds statement when it meets on april 26 and 27. it could offer more clarity on the direction of future rate hikes, which would influence the us dollar. "}, "142": {"date_posted": "21/4/2016", "title": "cover story: revitalising cimb", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on april 4 - 10, 2016. the dna of cimb group holdings bhd is changing. just in the past year alone, malaysias second largest banking group undertook several cost-cutting initiatives that included major mutual separation schemes (mss) and restructuring exercises in a few markets, costing it nearly rm720 million. it also saw the changing of the guard and reorganised its businesses as well as structure. today, more than 50% of the top guard at cimb group is new. additionally, investment banking, its jewel in the crown, is no longer as big a revenue driver as before. cimb groups consumer banking business is gaining ground. it contributed the most to its profit before tax for the financial year ended dec 31, 2015. it is obvious that the group, which had started off as an investment bank, is no longer as reliant on its investment banking business as before. the increase in contribution from the consumer segment, industry observers say, is also partly due to the headwinds the investment banking environment is facing. so, as the fee income drops owing to fewer deals, the contribution from the other segments such as consumer banking will show an increase. the first year has been very challenging, admits group ceo tengku datuk seri zafrul aziz. when he first took over the post from datuk seri nazir razak, zafrul says, the market was already showing signs that it would slow down.  what we didnt expect was the volatility and the extent of the challenges that we would face, he says. he took over as acting ceo in september 2014 and assumed the role officially in february 2015. in an exclusive interview with the edge, a candid zafrul shares that the journey at the driving seat of the group thus far has been an eye-opening experience. you cant plan for everything. but what is important is the ability to adapt and execute some of the things that we needed to do. in a way, you have seen our results. it is still very much a journey. t18 (target 2018) is towards 2018 but what we wanted to do is to make sure that we hit the milestones for 2015, he says. he adds that cimb group saw a positive jaws ratio in fy2015. a positive jaws ratio shows an entitys income growth rate exceeding its expenses growth rate, measured as a percentage. this is the first time we have managed to get a positive jaws. the last four years were all negative, where cost grew more than income. to change that ratio to a positive 6.9% is a massive step, he says. people were very sceptical about our cost management programme because cimb group is not normally known to cut cost. when cimb group said it would cut cost, nobody believed it ... but weve shown that [we can]. and when people said ... no way the management would do certain things ... weve shown that our guys can adapt to changes. on top of controlling cost last year, zafrul says, the cimb team managed to ensure that the engine was still strong. so, we recorded our highest-ever revenue for the group last year, despite the challenges. people were also worried about our capital, saying that we were a company that was very good at consuming capital but not generating enough returns on capital. weve showed that in the last quarter, our cet-1 (common equity tier-1), from 9.3% in september 2015, went all the way up to 10.3%, because we changed the way we approached capital, he says.  for fy2015, cimb group saw its top line growing 9% year on year to rm15.4 billion. its net profit dropped 8% to rm2.85 billion due to higher provisioning expenses. its return on equity (roe) stood at 7.3%, down from 9.2% in fy2014. cost to income ratio dropped to 55.6% from 59.1% for the same period while total capital ratio improved to 15.8% from 14.7% in the same period. cimb group made rm2.2 billion worth of provisions for fy2015  of which 71.7% came from cimb niaga, 22.7% from cimb thai and 5.6% from cimb bank. zafrul shares that the higher-than-expected provisions were a disappointment. we budgeted for it in indonesia, but we didnt budget for it this large. so, we hope that we learnt from that and this year, we need to make sure we put in place all the right systems and learn from the mistakes, he says (see accompanying story). despite concerns that the asset quality of local loans may deteriorate, he says, the group has yet to see an uptick in provisions here. we are pleasantly surprised. for malaysia, it depends on the economy. but whether this [asset quality remaining intact] is sustainable or not is another question, he says, adding that factors such as the macroeconomic environment and the operating landscape are very volatile. malaysia accounted for 79% of cimb groups profit before tax in fy2015 while indonesia and singapore both contributed 8% each, and thailand, 3%.  cost optimisation, divesting non-core acknowledging that income growth is still one of the top concerns of the industry today, zafrul says the group will continue to focus on optimising cost as well as divesting its non-core assets. i think now is a test for all of us to see how we address these concerns. we were lucky because we started the t18 initiative at the right time, he notes, adding that when markets are tough, one has to make tough decisions. we are looking at selling off non-core  this will free up some capital. last year also was a tough year because the whole restructuring cost was about close to rm718 million, so that eats into capital. and provisions also eat into capital. so, we need to make sure that its a one-off. this year, the restructuring cost wont be that high. aside from its major core banking businesses in southeast asia, cimb group also has a 20% stake in bank of yingkou in china that is parked under its private equity business. banking analysts say given that it is only a 20% stake, the chinese bank is a non-core asset. they also have a stake in the touch n go business, and there is also a view that the private equity business could be a potential non-core asset, says an analyst who covers the stock. the edge wrote in february, citing sources, that the group was in talks with foreign financial institutions to form partnerships for its securities business. the working relationship options it is exploring include selling part of the groups stake in the securities business. it was reported by singapore media recently that cimb group is in talks to sell at least part of its brokerage in singapore to a chinese broking house. just a fortnight ago, cimb group announced that it had signed a conditional pact to sell a 51% stake in pt cimb sun life to its joint-venture partner sun life assurance company for us$42 million. the group is on a mission to get its groove back. in february last year, cimb group outlined its new t18 plans with a target of achieving an roe of 15%, cet-1 ratio of over 11%, a cost income ratio of below 50%, and a 60% consumer banking income contribution by end-2018. industry observers point out that given the tougher operating landscape in the banking industry, banking groups that are stronger in the investment banking segment, such as cimb group, were harder hit as the pipeline for deals dried up and fee-based income fell. this, banking analysts say, could be one of the reasons why cimb group is looking to strengthen its consumer banking division contribution. consumer banking  the bread and butter business of traditional banks  provides a stable income flow. it may not be as sexy as investment banking, but it is a steady and predictable business. the investment banking heydays are over, says one analyst.  at the start of this year, cimb group retrenched 30 staff at its hong kong investment banking and equities operations. in 2015, cimb group cut over 150 jobs, mainly in the investment banking space outside malaysia and indonesia. the majority of them were from the royal bank of scotland, which cimb group bought in 2012. the rm800 million deal (consideration rm431.8 million with an additional rm417.6 million injected as capital) catapulted cimb group into an asia-pacific investment banking player. it had led some to question whether it may have overstretched itself as it led to a significant cost increase at cimb group. last year, cimb group also undertook a mss for its malaysian and indonesian businesses in which a total of 3,614 applications (1,908 from malaysia and 1,706 from indonesia) were approved. the group also saw a changing of the guard. today, more than 50% of its heads are new, including tigor m siahaan as president director of cimb niaga and rafe haneef as ceo of cimb islamic. a number of cimb groups heads, who were viewed as lieutenants of nazir, have left the operations side, giving zafrul space to shape his own team. they include former ceo of corporate banking, treasury and markets datuk lee kok kwan and former group cfo and ceo of group strategy and strategic investments kenny kim. lee and kim are now in advisory roles. lee is also a board member. zafrul shares that forming the team has been a high point for him. its not easy to take over from someone whos done so much for the company, right? ... and leaving it to me to take it to the next level. so, when i asked for advice, everyone kept telling me the most important ingredient is to make sure you have the right people, he says. he believes he has managed to form a good team with the right mix of people  both old and new to cimb group  who are strong in the industry.  stamping his mark when news broke over a year ago that nazir would be passing the ceos baton to zafrul, some people were not convinced that the latter could fill the formers big shoes. fast forward to a year after, and the scepticism seems to be fading away. give him credit for the cost cutting. it takes guts for someone to not be worried about the politics and go ahead ... it was the first major staff rationalisation exercise in the banking industry and it had to be done. revenue was suffering ... banks have no choice, says a director at a foreign financial services company. nazir has loosened his grip on cimb. they do consult him but from what i understand, he does not control the reins as much anymore, he adds. a team head at cimb group, who had worked with nazir and now reports to zafrul, acknowledges that cimb group has morphed quite a bit in recent times. under nazir, cimb was a one-man, one-personality banking group. that has changed under zafrul. some of the changes implemented recently, apart from the reorganising, also included regionalising consumer banking. we are also a balance sheet business now  funding and lending  and not just mainly advising, he says. he may not be as suave an operator as nazir, but he has so far done things that made sense for the group when the winds drastically changed so quickly. the hard decisions that he had made could have been disastrous but so far, i think we can all see that they are starting to pay off, he adds. asked what is it like to have worked for the both of them, he says, both have their own strengths, and also their own peculiarities. please, do not mention my name, he laughs. a managing director of a business unit at rival banking group maybank says zafrul gave room for existing talent to grow when he was ceo of the investment bank there. he played everyone to their respective strengths, which is a skill in its own right. i think its too early to tell whether or not he has made a positive impact at cimb group but to be fair to him, he did join the group at almost its lowest pointu2026 it was not exactly the best of times, says the senior banker, who had worked with zafrul in maybank. investors seem to be taking notice of the stock again. falling to below rm4 earlier this year, touching a six-year low of rm3.85 on jan 21, the stock has risen to close at rm4.77 last friday.  cimb group  notable events 1987 - bank of commerce lists on bursa malaysia. 1991 - bank of commerce merges with united asian bank. in a major restructuring, the

malaysian banks had a rough 2015. after multiple rounds of slashes in earnings forecasts and a series of negative news flows  from staff rationalisation exercises to rising loan impairments and even the rare regulatory penalty  they lost 6.8% or rm20.7 billion of their total market capitalisation in 2015. plagued by bearish sentiment, the sector has been trading at trough valuations in the past 10 years (see chart 1). to put things in perspective, the current price-to-book valuation of 1.2 times is roughly two standard deviations below the 10-year mean of 1.8 times. the last time we witnessed such a depressed valuation was in the first few quarters following the global financial crisis, which almost brought down the worlds financial system in late 2008. fast forward to 2016, predictions of an imminent global financial crisis have not materialised and bank negara malaysia has repeatedly assured markets that malaysian banks are well capitalised and resilient enough to withstand a financial crisis. so, is the current sentiment reflective of the sectors fundamentals or are investors overly pessimistic about its prospects? to answer that question, first we must look at what has been driving the sectors valuation down  return on equity (roe). as shown in chart 2, the sectors valuation is largely driven by roe, which has indeed been on a downtrend since reaching its peak in 2010. increased capital requirements and compliance costs have resulted in a lower roe for most malaysian banks, which traditionally have high roes. over the past four years, total equity has increased an outsized 78% while net profit has increased just 2%, pushing roe down from 16% in 2012 to 11% in 2015.  enlarged equity bases arising from capital-raising exercises aside, another reason for the falling roe is the slowing earnings growth momentum  net profit growth slowed from 29% in 2012 to 0.5% in 2014 and a contraction of 4.5% last year. earnings, the numerator in the roe ratio, is generally driven by four factors. the first two are loan growth rate and net interest margin (nim), which are by and large determined by the external macroeconomic environment and capital markets. on the other hand, banks typically have more control over the other two factors, that is, cost-to-income ratio (cir) and gross impaired loans (gil) ratio. aggregate loan growth for banks grew a respectable 10.3% in 2015, albeit somewhat helped by foreign exchange translation, from 11.5% a year ago (see chart 3). as expected, nim continued to compress to 2.6% in 2015 as deposit competition remained intense amid tighter liquidity conditions. meanwhile, cost-to-income ratios have been on the rise since 2012 (see chart 4) on negative jaws ratio (that is, expense growth of 16.8% outstripped income growth of 12.1% in the four-year period). in 2015, this ratio surged to an all-time high of 51.2% due to staff rationalisation exercises carried out by three banks. positively, asset quality is still holding up well with a healthy gil of 1.8% in 2015. that said, given its highly leveraged business model, a seemingly small increase in non-performing assets could hurt its profit and loss statement and balance sheet should the macroeconomic conditions deteriorate.  a return of higher roe in 2016? if roe is the single best indicator of the performance of bank shares, the questions are, did the sectors roe bottom out in 2015 and will it see a rebound in 2016? bank managements generally say that 2016 will be a challenging year, while most research houses are adopting a cautious wait and see stance on the sector. despite the cheap valuations, the key concern is asset quality  arguably the most important indicator to watch and possibly the key share price driver in the late stages of the credit cycle. for local banks, the vulnerable sectors that are at risk include steel, oil and gas (o&g) and commodities. notably, just-concluded 2015 results show huge losses incurred by the o&g sector, particularly the upstream segments such as exploration and production (e&p), shipbuilding and chartering and support services. that said, according to bank negaras financial stability and payment systems report 2015, total bank credit exposure to the o&g industry accounted for a manageable 2.2% of total credit exposure. however, alliancedbs research points out in a march 1 note that ammb holdings bhd has the highest o&g exposure at less than 5%, followed by cimb group holdings bhd (3%), rhb capital bhd (3%) and malayan banking bhd (2.8%) while public bank bhd, hong leong bank bhd and alliance financial group bhd have the least exposure (less than 1%). the research house also conservatively assumes that credit cost will remain high at cimb due to its indonesian operations. however, it expects credit costs to ease in 2h2016. nonetheless, not everyone thinks all is doom and gloom for the banking sector. affin hwang capital and cimb research opine that the sector is poised for a recovery this year, driven by a narrower increase in loan loss provisioning and a decline in operating expenses stemming from staff separation and related restructuring exercises carried out by three banks last year. nevertheless, alliancedbs research is of the view that earnings improvement in 2016, a result of kitchen sinking activities last year, will just be cosmetic and should not warrant too much excitement as there are no visible signs of improvement in the fundamentals of the malaysian banking sector.  which bank to bank on? while the industry indicators do not appear to be overwhelmingly encouraging, there are perhaps banks with particular industry positions and company-specific competitive advantages that might continue to do well even in bad times. alliancedbs research segregates the banks into three groups: (1) resilient banks with no capital-raising or asset quality issues and strong business drivers (public bank and hong leong bank are top picks); (2) banks that have raised capital, have moderate asset quality indicators and are looking to re-energise business growth (rhb capital, with maybank and cimb at the borderline); and (3) banks that may face capital-raising risks, have asset quality problems or struggle to find a business direction (affin holdings bhd and ammb). a popular choice of the analyst fraternity is public bank  one of the best credit underwriters in the region with a defensive low-risk loan book. the countrys third largest bank by assets delivered a respectable roe of 18.8% and year-on-year increase of 12% in net profit in 2015, aided by loan loss recoveries (see columns 3 and 4 of table 1). furthermore, its cost-to-income of 32.6% and gross impaired loans ratio of 0.5% remain way below the industry average, thanks to its strong cost efficiency profile and credit underwriting culture. another popular pick is maybank owing to its size and ability to attract deposits, well-diversified business portfolio with extensive regional exposure in asean (15.8% pre-tax profit from singapore, followed by 3.7% from indonesia) as well as its attractive 6% yield. nonetheless, the diversified portfolio also translates into volatile revenues, owing to currency rate movements and insurance operations. additionally, management also guided for higher impaired loans in 2016. for investors seeking deep value, a quick glance (see column 2 of table 1) reveals that rhbcap is the cheapest among the mid-sized banks with its share price trading 21% below its book value. although its roe is at the lower end among its peers (see column 3), its recent rationalisation exercise should boost its bottom line by up to rm200 million this year. in addition, management targets to complete the corporate restructuring exercise by transferring the listing status to rhb bank by 2q2016, which could be a rerating catalyst. as to what banks to avoid, analysts top choices are ammb and affin. ammb is the worst performing bank stock, which saw its share price plummet 27.7% in the past one year (see column 5). despite its 5% discount to book value and a decent 4% yield, ammb is weighed down by compliance weaknesses, ongoing nim compression and low current account, savings account (casa) base, analysts say. affin, the smallest banking group by market value, is the worst performing bank in terms of financial metrics. the bank has the lowest roe of 4.8% and the highest cost-to-income of 61.7%, owing in part to transaction and integration costs incurred to acquire hwangdbs business. in 2015, net profit plunged 37.7% from a year before while the share price declined 19.6%  the third steepest after ammb and cimb. unless its earnings growth gains traction, the huge 50% discount is probably reflective of its single-digit roe and potential capital-raising risks, which will in turn lower roe. apart from roe, what is perhaps the quickest way to boost valuations is the presence of suitors who are willing to pay at least 1.5 times book value. at a time when banks are rationalising to emerge stronger, some may well be just ripe for the picking.

(iii) non-interest income growth picking up some paces (+4.7%/+11.7% vs fy15: -1.6%); (iv) credit charge ratio for the sector increasing by 7bps for fy16 but weakening by 1bps the following year (fy15: 12bps) to 39bps-38bps; (v) cost-to-income ratio falling by 169bps-124bps (fy15: +165bps) to 49%-47.7%, and (vi) earnings to grow marginally by 0.1% in fy16 but surge strongly by 6.7% for fy17 in anticipation of improved metrics as mentioned above (vs fy15: -2.1%). for the past six years, the asset quality of the banking industry has been improving. as at feb 16, we observed that the industrys gross impaired loans (gil) ratio had fallen to a low of 1.64%. with the expected subdued domestic economy and banks restrictive in lending, we expect gil to remain stable at around 1.75% for fy16 (1.74% for fy15), and shedding 3bps to 1.72% for fy17. although the economy is expected to be slower in 2016, the appreciating ringgit and stronger commodity prices might boost confidence in the economy, prompting banks to lower their loan loss provisions and thus lower credit charge. we see maybank and rhbcap as likely beneficiaries from such revisions. with no let-up in the current structural and cyclical concerns such as: (i) slower loan growth, (ii) narrowing liquidity environment, (iii) compressing nim, (iv) weak capital market activities, as well as (v) rising credit costs, we continue to be neutral on the banking sector. hence, we advocate caution and adopt a selective stock picking strategy; rhbcap (target price [tp]: rm6.23) and maybank (tp: rm9.33) are the outperforms in our banking stocks universe. we like rhbcap for its cheap valuation at 0.8 times price-to-book-value (p/bv) versus the industry average of 1.5 times p/bv which is nearly reaching its lowest point in its 10-year history; hence, we believe the stock price has bottomed out. essentially, we like maybank for its extensive regional exposure in asean-5. both banks will also benefit from any downward revision of credit charge ratio.  kenanga research, april 5"}, "146": {"date_posted": "5/4/2016", "title": "warrants update: hsl-cd an alternative for sarawak counter", "article": " this article first appeared in capital, the edge malaysia weekly, on march 28 - april 3, 2016. closing at rm2.07 last tuesday after multiple contract wins, kuching-based builder hock seng lee bhd (hsl) looks poised to challenge its all-time high of rm2.66 recorded in march 1997, especially if its winning streak continues with sarawak counters on investors radar screen ahead of the state elections.  the stock has already gained 28.6% from its 52-week low of rm1.61 registered on aug 24 last year. five of the six analysts polled on bloomberg, who updated their calls on march 18 and 21 following the construction companys recent contract wins, have a buy on it at the time of writing. their target prices range from kenanga investment bank researchs rm2.19 to aminvestment banks rm2.80, or an average of rm2.48 apiece. the nearest to this is maybank investment banks rm2.45. investors interested in trading hsl have an alternative in kenanga investment bank bhd-issued cash-settled call warrants hsl-cd. the warrants  issued at 15 sen apiece on march 14  have an exercise ratio of 1.5 hsl-cd to one share. the exercise price is rm2 apiece and expiry is on nov 11 this year. closing as high as 21.5 sen on march 21 before ending at 20 sen last tuesday, hsl-cd gained 33.3% over five market days, during which time the underlying share rose 4.5% from rm1.98 to rm2.07. at 21.5 sen, hsl-cd was at an 11.1% premium to the underlying share. if hsl rises 18.4% to reach maybank-ibs rm2.45 target price in the next six months, hsl-cd should theoretically be worth 50% more at 30 sen apiece, assuming zero premium to the underlying share. in the same vein, hsl-cd should theoretically be worth 166.7% more at 53.34 sen if hsl breaches its all-time high, rising 35.3% to rm2.80 apiece in the coming six months. according to maybank-ib, hsls record high job wins in 2016 would lead to a strong step-up in 2017 earnings and higher 2017 dividends too. its rm2.45 target price is based on an unchanged 12.5 times 2017 earnings after raising its forecast by 3% after hsls 70%-owned unit clinched a rm1.7 billion, 51-month contract to build the pan-borneo highway, which doubled the groups outstanding order book to rm2.4 billion. assuming a pretax profit margin of 12%, we forecast a net profit contribution of rm108 million (20 sen eps) into 2020 u2026 there could be further job wins from other infrastructure projects, including score, as we inch closer to the sarawak election expected to be held in april, maybank-ibs chai li shin wrote in a march 21 note.

lumpur: airasia bhd shares edged up to a nine-month high yesterday on news of a proposed rm1.01 billion injection by its two founders  tan sri tony fernandes and datuk kamarudin meranun. the stock rose 5.46% or 10 sen to close at the days high of rm1.93, with 62.57 million shares changing hands, making it the second-most actively traded counter on bursa malaysia. its market capitalisation stood at rm5.23 billion. however, analysts tracking the stock said while the subscription price of rm1.84 is fair, the proposed share issue may not sit well with its minority shareholders as it would result in a 15.3% dilution in its earnings per share (eps). in a note to clients yesterday, cimb research said from a quantitative perspective, the higher share base will dilute eps. investors typically dislike dilution. some investors may wonder why airasia needs to raise equity now when operating cashflows are strong as a result of low oil prices and the stable competitive environment, it said. last friday, airasia announced a proposed placement of 559 million new shares to fernandes and kamarudin at rm1.84 apiece to potentially raise rm1.01 billion, which will increase its share base by 20% once completed by the third quarter of 2016. the exercise is subject to shareholder approval. maybank investment bank research (maybank ib) opined that when founding shareholders inject new capital into a business, it is often when the business is in distress or debt financing is no longer attainable. however, it noted that in airasias case, the low-cost carrier is far from distress and is instead on track to deliver strong earnings growth in 2016. while the capital injection will benefit the group, it is not critical as airasia had a manageable net gearing of 2.29 times as at the end of 2015. furthermore, minority shareholders will lose out as their shareholdings will be diluted, and some might not be happy that they are not given the option to participate, said maybank ib in a note yesterday. midf research stated that while the placement would cause an unwelcome dilution of 15.3% in eps to existing shareholders, what they would actually be getting in return is a reduction in debt by rm342 million, which reduces financing costs by rm10.7 million. higher equity and lower debt reduce net gearing from 2.29 times to 1.8 times, and another point to note is 65.5% of the proceeds are to fund the airlines expansion, said the research firm. cimb research said investors should take note of the two qualitative aspects that standout in the proposal. firstly, the founders are willing to put in additional cash at the existing undiscounted share price, which suggests that they believe airasia is worth much more. secondly, they will raise their stake from 18.9% to 32.4%, meaning that they will have even greater commitment and incentive to make it work, it added. cimb research believes that investors will ultimately take their cue from the positive qualitative aspects of the placement exercise and so, near-term pressure on the share price should be eventually absorbed. the issue price represents a 0.6% premium to the airlines closing price last thursday of rm1.83 and a 31.4% premium to the 12-month volume-weighted average price of rm1.41 per share. post the proposed share issuance, fernandes and kamarudin will hold a 32.5% stake in airasia, just slightly under the 33% threshold to make a mandatory general offer to the airlines minority shareholders."}, "148": {"date_posted": "1/4/2016", "title": "index firmly capped by the 62% level", "article": " this

completed in october 2014, and the company had been working with advisers since to lift the pn17 status. ml globals chart trend in the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is firmly up. from a weekly wave 5 low of 30 sen (december 2014), its prices have turned up strongly in the daily, weekly and monthly time frames to a recent march 2016 high of 64 sen. as prices broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of 50 sen and 54 sen, look to buy ml global on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term uptrend for the stock. the daily,

2016. rising dividend payments are traditionally equated with balance sheet strength, but the smart investor knows that is not always the case. some learnt the hard way, having bought into companies that were paying shareholders using future earnings and borrowings instead of just returning excess cash. others knew some dividend streams were unsustainable but bought the stocks anyway because of their thirst for yield during times of ultra-low interest rates. they helped chased prices of these so-called quasi cash cows higher but not all escaped with profits when reality dawned. investors who have wised up are questioning the sustainability of dividends as growth gets tougher to find amid rising costs and industry-wide landscape changes, which threaten future earnings that are needed to fuel continued dividend payments. a stretched balance sheet (read high net debt) is another clue that historical increases in dividend payments are no assurance of dividend payments going forward. yield stocks remain sought after even as the world grapples with the impact of negative interest rates. and investment premiums have risen considerably, just over seven years after the us federal reserve announced its first quantitative easing (qe1) programme in late 2008. in malaysia, there is added reason to seek safety in dividends. an uptick in political uncertainties following tun dr mahathir mohamads resignation from umno could dampen the ringgits positive momentum, uob kay hian malaysia head of research vincent khoo says in a march 2 note. he advises clients to stay defensive and focus on dividend yield plays. his list of attractive quality high-dividend yielders includes malayan banking bhd (maybank), hong leong industries bhd, igb reit and carlsberg brewery malaysia bhd, with yields ranging from 5.9% to 6.3%. uob kay hian also has a buy on guinness anchor bhd. meanwhile, maybank investment bank research tells its clients that 2016 earnings could be down 2% for guinness anchor and 2.7% for carlsberg on the assumption that volumes will contract 0.3% (the same quantum as 2003 when excise duty was raised 10%) due to an expected tax hike on alcohol from march 1. its report, also dated march 2, forecasts a dividend yield of at least 6% for carlsberg (hold, rm13 target price) and guinness anchor (buy, rm15 target price), with no change in expectations pending further clarity from management. the tax hike, while expected, is one example of how earnings  and in turn dividend payments  could be affected by operating changes. a quick search found 140 stocks that have above the fbm klcis 3.4% average yield for 2017 (3.16% for 2016), according to bloomberg data at the time of writing. of these, 62 have yields above 5% and these include the five stocks mentioned so far: maybank (5.85%), hong leong industries (5.61%), igb reit (5.62%), carlsberg (5.87%) and guinness anchor (6.46%). the last is among only 30 companies with above 6% yield, bloomberg data shows. those familiar with bloomberg knows it has proprietary analytic functions and limitations. and the yield figures cited here is largely a function of consensus analyst forecasts, coupled with the latest historical reported financial figures, which may not be reflective going forward if the companies balance sheets are stretched or if there is a significant change in operating conditions or inherent competitiveness. that is not to say these figures cannot be relied upon, but rather, that investors need to do a lot more work to be certain that the yields they want will continue to come. even the safe bet telekom malaysia bhd  the only stock on bursa malaysia that has a minimum dividend payout promise of rm700 million or up to 90% of its annual profits  is going through a rough patch as it puts its foot back into the mobile business, a segment spun off into the current axiata group bhd in 2009. for now, due to confidence in the dividend promise, yield has compressed to 2.87% at its rm6.63 close last thursday, assuming its payout falls nearer to rm700 million (19 sen per share) this year. yield was 3.11% on the same assumptions at its recent low of rm6.10 a share last august. there will be periodic market imperfections, but as the maxim goes, higher gains often come with higher risk. it is worth noting that seven of the 12 stocks with yields of above 7% (according to bloomberg data) are real estate investment trusts (reits), which need to pay out over 90% of their earnings as dividends in order to get tax pass-through benefits. simply put, whatever their real cash needs are, reits have to pay out 90% of its annual profits to avoid paying corporate tax  just one exception to the adage of consistent dividend payers being cash-rich companies. while reits can provide stable cash flow, they can be faced with a dilemma when their assets age and need refurbishment if costs are higher than their cash reserves  one which can lead to asset sales or a rights issue. business trusts, which do not have a minimum dividend threshold but are allowed to pay them even without having profits, would fall under a similar category of dividend payers that are not necessarily cash rich. rather than a reward to shareholders, these dividend streams can, at times, be likened to interest payments. to be sure, the well-managed ones can go on for a long time and their chances are higher if the underlying assets are those that can appreciate in value rather than those with a straight-line depreciation with a definitive end-life. but even the latter can provide a learned investor with decent returns in the initial years. media companies  broadcaster and publisher media prima bhd and star media group  are also among the stocks with yields of over 7% at the time of writing. media primas portfolio contains the countrys free-to-air tv and radio stations plus three national newspapers  new straits times, berita harian and harian metro. star medias mainstay is the star english newspaper. the good news is that both companies are still in a net cash position, with the caveat being the challenges the industry is going through as consumption patterns change due to technology and the ubiquitous internet. both companies, like many others, are reining in overhead costs while investing in new sources of growth. it is worth noting that both star media and media prima have been paying out at least 50% of profits since fy2011, according to bloomberg data. while past payment track records may not necessarily reflect ability for future payments, the assumption here is that companies that have consistently been making over 50% payouts and are still in a net cash position or have low net debt, should be able to continue to make generous payments. others will have to work harder to replenish their cash positions. there are about 40 companies with yields of over 4% that have been paying out at least 50% of their profits as dividends for at least three of the past five fiscal years, a quick search on bloomberg shows (see table). of these companies, a number are still in a net cash position while at least eight of them have over two times net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda), according to bloomberg data. the latter are mrcb-quill, ytl corp bhd, capitaland malaysia malls trust, ytl hospitality reit, boustead holdings and lingkaran trans kota holdings bhd. on the other hand, those with more than two times net cash to ebitda include bursa malaysia bhd, shl consolidated bhd, star media, uchi, apollo food holdings bhd, amway malaysia bhd and elsoft research bhd. when recently asked for guidance on yield, rhb research institute executive chairman and chief economist lim chee sing says investors focus should be on stocks with improved business model, reasonable earnings visibility, strong cash flows, a dividend policy put in place and, hence, sustainable dividend payments. of course, one cannot ignore valuations as well, as rich valuation stocks are still susceptible to selldowns should global economy take another turn for the worse, adds lim. these words are worth pondering over as one seeks out the right defensive stocks to bolster his portfolio.

persist. due to the upbeat tone for the fbm klci, we are recommending a chart buy on carlsberg brewery malaysia bhd. the company manufactures beer, stout, shandy and non-alcoholic beverages. a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that nine research houses cover this stock, with eight buy calls and one hold call. maybank investment bank bhds analyst recently upgraded carlsberg malaysia from a hold call to a buy call with a target price of rm14.20 from rm13, having imputed the reduced regulatory risk post the recent excise tax hike announcement of about 10%. carlsberg malaysia has also passed on part of the excise increase to consumers via higher selling prices. the fourth quarter of financial year 2015 (4qfy15) core net profit increased 18% year-on-year and 19% quarter-on-quarter respectively, which was above expectations. better-than-expected sales and margin contributions from singapore were the factors that boosted core net profit. carlsberg malaysias chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames are firmly up. from a daily wave-5 low of rm11.30 (nov 25, 2015), its prices have turned up strongly on the daily and weekly time frames to a recent march 2016 high of rm13.96. as prices broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of rm13.08 and rm13.18, look to buy carlsberg malaysia on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term uptrend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, oscillator and stochastic) have issued clear buy signals and now show firm and obvious indications of carlsberg malaysias eventual rise towards much higher levels. it would attract firm buying activities at the support levels of rm13.08, rm13.18 and rm13.90. we expect carlsberg malaysia to witness some mild profit-taking activities at its resistance levels of rm13.96, rm14.02 and rm15.39. its clear upside targets are located at rm14.89, rm15.85 and rm17.53.  lee cheng hooi

epf earnings", "article": " this article appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on february 29 - march 6, 2016  those who have been keeping track of the employees provident funds (epf) earnings in recent years, would know that equities  essentially stock price gains and dividends  have brought in 55% to 60% of its investment income for the past three years, despite the asset class making up only 42% to 44% of its total investment assets. while the epf still keeps just over 50% of its assets in fixed income instruments, including government bonds and other investment grade debt paper, it should be no surprise in the current low yield environment that interest from fixed income instruments only brought in 35% to 40% of its annual investment income from 2013 to 2015. it is worth noting, however, that dividends from local stocks could have contributed up to a quarter of the epfs earnings in 2015, back-of-the-envelope calculations show. can investors also profit from tracking the epf? based on its top 30 domestic equity holdings as at end-2015, it is estimated that dividend income from these stocks came up to between rm1.8 billion and rm3.2 billion  that is easily 15% to 25% of the epfs local equities income for 2015  assuming that local equities accounted for 50% of its equities income, or rm13 billion. the epf acknowledged the contribution from the equities asset class when it declared its record dividend payout of rm38.24 billion for 2015, up 4.3% from rm36.66 billion in 2014 (albeit on a lower 6.4% rate versus 2014s 6.75%, but still above fixed deposit rates and the risk-free rate of below 4%). during the year in review, equities continued to be the main contributor of income with 58.81% amounting to rm26.01 billion, up 13.54% compared with rm22.91 billion in 2014, its feb 20 statement read. the epf went on to say that the foreign equity portfolio played a significant role in 2015 by generating more than 50% of the income from equity investment. the significance of dividend income from investments in local equities to total earnings goes up if foreign equities account for a lot more than 50% of equities income in 2015. the epf reports its top 30 local equity holdings on a quarterly basis but not foreign equities. what is known is that epf ceo datuk shahril ridza ridzuan previously said the epf invests in quality blue-chips overseas, much like its domestic strategy. it is estimated that the epfs foreign assets were worth about rm171.13 billion, given that they make up 25% of the provident funds total investment assets of rm684.53 billion as at end-2015. according to its 2015 earnings briefing slides, 43.4% of the epfs foreign assets are in asia, of which 97% were in equities. a quarter of its foreign assets were in north america, of which 60% were in equities and 39% fixed income. europe accounted for 22.9% of investment assets, of which 64% were in equities. australia has an allocation of 5.2%, of which 29% was in equities and 56% in fixed income instruments. at 25% (rm171 billion) in 2015, the growth in the proportion of foreign assets to local assets has slowed year on year, from 23% (rm146 billion) in 2014. foreign assets accounted for 20% (about rm118 billion) of the epfs total assets in 2013, 17% (about rm90 billion) in 2012 and 13% (about rm61 billion) in 2011. but, just like the equities asset class, the epfs foreign assets accounted for a significantly higher portion of total earnings in 2015  a testament to its structured overseas investment programme, which it said formally started in 2006. overseas income was also higher in ringgit terms with the ringgit sharply lowere last year. despite making up only 25% of total investment size, foreign investments contributed 48% of the epfs total rm44.23 billion investment income in 2015, thus outperforming domestic assets, epf chairman tan sri samsudin osman said in the feb 20 statement. the epf is reportedly looking to increase its foreign assets to 27% over the coming two years to diversify its portfolio. it is worth noting, however, that the epfs foreign assets touched 27% as at end-september 2015. it is not immediately certain why foreign assets reduced from 3q2015 to 4q2015, but the change in the strength of the ringgit could be a factor. to the question of whether the epf faces constraints in diversifying overseas, given putrajayas recent instruction to repatriate foreign investments, the epf ceo reportedly said the government had never stopped the epf from acquiring overseas assets as it understood the need for diversification. another outperformer is the predictable income stream from the alternative investment class, namely the real estate and infrastructure asset class, which contributed rm1.7 billion in investment income in 2015, up 22.2% from 2014. this asset class  which includes foreign investments and was initiated in 2010, which the epf said showed encouraging performance  reportedly accounts for about 4% of total earnings, while making up 3% of total assets. the intent is to have this asset class make up about 8% to 10% of investments over the next three to five years. for investors interested in tracking the epfs equities investments, a quick comparison of its top 30 local stock investments found that it broadly increased its holdings in stocks whose prices ended lower year on year in 2015, except for media prima bhd, sime darby bhd and ijm plantations bhd, in which the provident fund reduced its exposure even as stock prices fell. similarly, the epf pared holdings in stocks whose prices ended higher year on year in 2015, except for public bank bhd, united plantations bhd, ijm corp bhd and dialog group bhd, in which it raised holdings year on year, even as share prices rose. it should be noted that an end-2014 to end-2015 holdings comparison only shows a year-on-year change in portfolio standings and is simplistic as it might not capture a change in buy or sell directions between the 12 months. put another way, the epf and its portfolio managers could have taken profit while share prices moved higher and bought shares again when prices fell. according to stock exchange filings, as at feb 24 this year, the epf was still buying united plantations and dialog while paring its exposure to sime darby and ijm plantations. it is also worth noting that purchases of bimb holdings bhd shares were among the largest year-on-year increases in shareholding by the epf among its top 30 domestic equity holdings. as at end-2015, the epf held 12.6% of bimb, up more than 3% from 9.49% at end-2014. the epfs stake in bimb rose further to 12.99% as at feb 22, stock exchange filings show. the epf also bought tenaga nasional bhd shares, which fell on fears of it overpaying for acquisitions as well as a surprise tax bill. other sizeable year-on-year increases in holdings in 2015 were banking stocks, including malayan banking bhd, where its shareholding went from 13.3% as at end-2014 to 17.06% at end-2015, but this had been reduced to 15.49% at the time of writing. the epf also raised its stake in cimb group holdings bhd from 14.65% as at end-2014 to 17.41% at end-2015 while it currently holds 16.92%. the epfs shareholding in ammb holdings bhd rose from 14.36% as at end-2014 to 16.45% at end-2015 and stood at 15.98% at the time of writing. [see table] meanwhile, a new addition to its top 30 holdings list last year was malakoff corp bhd, which had an initial public offering in may last year. the epf reduced its equity interest from 30% to 17.45% by offering part of its stake for sale. its shareholding was 18.83% as at end-2015 but had fallen to 17.5% at the time of writing. more importantly, 90% of the epfs top 30 investments paid some form of dividend in 2014 and at least 60% are likely to do the same for 2015. in 2014, total dividends from its top 30 holdings are estimated at rm3.2 billion. while the reporting season for 2015 was still ongoing at the time of writing, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that at least rm1.8 billion had been paid to the epf by those that have announced fy2015 dividends  a testament to the importance of yield to bolster ones portfolio.

lumpur: property sales by developers listed on bursa malaysia are expected to be flat or slightly worse than 2015 this year, said cimb analyst saw xiao jun. however, he is expecting the sector to recover in the second half of 2016 (2h16) as stronger economic growth should boost consumer confidence. although the near-term outlook for the property sector remains challenging, saw remains overweight on the property sector, as he believes that the sectors fundamentals are better than perceived. he noted that the supply of new houses had lagged behind demand over the past few years, suggesting that there should be strong pent-up demand for housing. in addition, developers have repositioned their offerings towards meeting demand for mass-market housing, in response to poor appetite for high-end properties. if investors are not confident about the sector recovery in 2h16, they can stick to property stocks that offer dividends such as lbs bina group bhd and uoa development bhd during the downturn, and get capital gains when the sector recovers in the long term, he told the edge financial daily. saw is of the view that lbs and uoa development are safer picks, as both companies offer dividends to investors, to be supported by unbilled sales. in a note to clients dated feb 3, saw was projecting that lbs will offer dividend yields of 7%-9% in the financial years ending dec 31, 2016 and 2017 (fy16 and fy17) (inclusive of a special dividend of six sen per share for fy16-17), the highest among all the property developers under his coverage. meanwhile, the dividend yield for uoa development is projected to be 6.83% for fy16. lbs recognised a revenue of rm680.4 million in fy15, a 1.8% increase year-on-year (y-o-y) from rm668.3 million, while earnings rose 8.7% y-o-y to rm76 million. however, its unbilled sales hit a record high of rm993 million as at dec 31, 2015. this, coupled with the expected strong sales in 2016, could lift its revenue to rm1 billion in 2017, based on saws estimates. for uoa development, saw cut fy16-17 forecast earnings per share (eps) by 4% to reflect a shift in sales mix in favour of smaller and lower-priced units in 1h16, and narrower profit margins due to more incentives offered to entice homebuyers.  his top pick is eco world development group bhd (ecoworld), as he believes that the company will be able to achieve its rm4 billion sales target for the financial year ending oct 31, 2016, underpinned by the launch of its rm8.7 billion bukit bintang convention centre and rm10 billion eco marina projects. while saw cut ecoworlds fy16 eps by 15% to reflect the challenging conditions in 1h16, he raised fy17-18 forecast eps by 0.3-8% as he expects 2h16 to be better. his other pick in the sector is eastern & oriental bhd. while appetite for high-end properties is likely to remain weak in 2016, saw is of the view that the stake sale in the first package of its seri tanjung pinang phase 2 could be a rererating catalyst for the stock, as it would crystallise the value of the land. in a note dated march 2, alliancedbs research head bernard ching expected slower property sales volumes in 2016,

(ingress did not provide any updated financial numbers during the interview, although the filing for the listing on set should include its financial standing. however, the filing was only prepared in thai.) according to news reports, iit posted a net profit of thb163.77 million (rm19.7 million) on revenue of thb2.55 billion as at last october. if the numbers are accurate, it indicates that itt has a net profit margin of 6.4%. as for the former listed entity, ingress, its revenue in fy2013 was rm859.23 million with a net profit of rm20.15 million, for a net profit margin of only 2.35%. the low net profit margin was due to the bmw dealership, which brought in high revenue but a razor-thin margin. on the decision to list in thailand as opposed to malaysia, ingress home country, rameli says automotive companies get better valuations in bangkok compared with kuala lumpur. based on bloomberg data, aapico hitech pcl was valued at 12.82 times earnings for a market capitalisation of rm398 million as at last thursday while thai steel cable pcl was priced at over 20 times earnings for a market valuation of rm342 million. apm automotive holding bhd was trading at 10.55 times earnings as at last thursday while ep manufacturing bhd was valued at 10.75 times earnings. mbm resources bhd, which has an automotive dealership business similar to ingress, was priced at 8.52 times earnings. the rm300 million to rm400 million market valuation would put iit on a par with aapico and thai steel cable. aapicos net profit in the financial year ended dec 31, 2014 (fy2014), was rm37 million while thai steel cables was rm15.8 million. the listing of iit is also about riding the growth of thailands automotive industry, says rameli. the federation of thai industries forecasts vehicle production in the kingdom to increase 2% year on year to 1.95 million units in 2016. iit owns 62.5% of ingress autoventures co ltd, a thailand-based company. katayama kogyo co ltd owns 31.4% of ingress autoventures while yonei & co ltd owns the rest. iit also owns 90% of fine components (thailand) co ltd with iwamoto co ltd holding the other 10%. in malaysia, iits business is represented by ingress industrial (malaysia) sdn bhd (iim), a wholly-owned subsidiary. iim owns 90% of ingress precision sdn bhd with the remaining stake held by katayama. iim also owns 70% of ingress technologies sdn bhd, of which perusahaan otomobil kedua sdn bhd (perodua) holds the rest. according to rameli, if all goes well, iit may buy the stake in ingress technologies currently held by perodua in the future. in indonesia, ingress precision owns 60% of pt ingress malindo ventures with katayama owning 25% and indonesian company,pt tidar adyagiri sakti holding the rest. ingress technologies, meanwhile, owns 100% equity interest in pt ingress technologies indonesia. as a whole, iit houses three manufacturing facilities in thailand, three plants in malaysia and one factory in indonesia. based on ingress financial results for fy2013, its malaysian businesses contributed the bulk of the groups revenue and its thailand operation made up about 25%. indonesias contribution to the groups revenue was only 1% as at fy2013. however, the malaysian operation includes the pad business, which has very thin profit margins. the dealership contributed 38.4% to ingress total automotive division revenue in the fourth quarter of fy2013 (4qfy2013), but it was loss-making during the quarter. on the other hand, ingress acm business from thailand contributed 29.4% to the groups automotive division revenue in 4qfy2013, but made up 70% of the divisions profit. the malaysian acm business brought in 30.5% of the divisions revenue and 29.7% of the profit. ingress also has a presence in india through ingress mayur auto ventures pvt ltd, of which it owns 40% through ingress engineering sdn bhd. mayur industries ltd, an india-based automotive components manufacturer, holds the majority stake. the indian business is not included in the listing of iit in bangkok. however, rameli reveals that ingress may include the indian venture in iit in the future, provided that it owns a majority stake. the listing of iit provides investors with an opportunity to ride the growth of southeast asias automotive sector as it has operations in the top three markets for passenger vehicles in the region."},

rates in china, which is still seeing decent economic growth and has the largest foreign reserve pile in the world despite recent capital outflows. can one be blamed for suffering from monetary policy fatigue? thanks to the bank of japans surprise interest rate cut to -0.1% in january and the stock sell-off that ensued, nirp (negative interest rate policy) is the new four-letter word. it is seen as another form of qe, which technically should depreciate ones currency and nudge investors to seek better returns elsewhere. in that sense, assets that provide better yields should benefit, experts say. yet, the fact that countries accounting for nearly a quarter of the worlds economy  the eu, switzerland and japan  are in a so-called sub-zero environment is seen as a sign of desperation on the part of central bankers. some even think the us might stop or reverse normalisation, especially as china works out the right place for its currency, heightening concerns that policymakers are running out of options. what does the new frontier of negative interest rates in the global arena mean for investors? for rhb research institute executive chairman and chief economist lim chee sing, nirp can only be seen as a temporary expedient to hold up financial markets, albeit one that has little room to push for more economic growth in this relatively mature stage of the growth cycle. that means rising investment premiums and heightened market volatility will likely be the order of the day in the days ahead. portfolio investors may have no choice but to build some degree of defensiveness into their portfolios to balance out the risks. this implies rising appetite for high-yield stocks, lim says. even dividend stocks have caveats in the days ahead, largely due to their rich valuations vis-u00e0-vis tougher conditions to grow at the same rate as before. for example, sin stocks might have to contend with higher taxes; the fees for telecommunications spectrum refarming have yet to be revealed; and consumer stocks have to contend with the possibility of a further tightening of consumer spending. then, there is the higher labour cost. the focus should be on stocks with an improved business model, reasonable earnings visibility, strong cash flow, a dividend policy and, thus, sustainable dividend payments. of course, one cannot ignore valuations but rich valuation stocks are still susceptible to a selldown should the global economy take a turn for the worse, lim adds. gerald ambrose, ceo of aberdeen islamic asset management sdn bhd, too, noted expensive valuations after a good run in recent years. we are keeping a close eye on notable high-yield companies, like the cellular phone companies, the brewers, tobacco companies and the reits (real estate investment trusts). were currently about halfway though the 4q2015 results season and to be honest, a lot of the better-managed companies have been able to find efficiencies to enable dividend payout to remain high. however, after outperforming for over a year, a lot of the high dividend yield companies are hardly cheap, he says. vincent khoo, who is head of research for malaysia at uob kay hian, for one, believes theres still a handful of quality high-yield stocks to get exposure in. its not too late [to enter]  referring to companies with defensive cash flow that offer more than 5.5% yield on prevailing stock prices. he counts malayan banking bhd (target price: rm10, trough target price: rm8.21), hong leong industries bhd (target price: rm6.85), sunway reit (target price: rm1.70) and carlsberg brewery malaysia bhd (target price: rm12.50) as compelling, quality high-yield dividend stocks. his feb 17 note did not provide specific dividend forecasts for 2016. also notable are buy-rated berjaya sports toto bhd and guinness anchor bhd, and hold-rated igb reit, khoo says in the note, which lists seven stocks with at least 6% yield and another two with at least 5.6% for 2016. quality high-yield stocks should stage a better outperformance in 2016 in terms of capital appreciation as investors price in a more modest us interest rate hike cycle. in 2015, only seven of the 13 high-yield stocks within our coverage (expected to deliver yields of 5% or higher at the beginning of 2015) registered positive capital gains as their performances were dampened by us rate hike concerns or earnings downgrades. but the fact that uob kay hians updated trough assessments of individual stocks indicate that most companies are not yet trading at compelling bargain prices. this points to sizeable downside potential should there be another round of global crisis. for now, the research house continue to assume a mildly negative market trough of 1,560 [points] for the fbm klci, which explicitly assumes a lower corporate earnings growth of 2% and market per of 0.5 times standard deviation below the historical mean per as the probability of a financial crisis re-emerging globally or domestically remains low. uob kay hian also maintained its end-2016 fbm klci target of 1,750 points, which implies 15 times 2016 earnings, just above the 14.7 times long-term mean per, supported by sufficient domestic liquidity. to be sure, the ringgits direction in the months ahead remains a wildcard but seasoned fund manager ambrose, for one, points out that malaysia still has positive real interest rates. yes, it has an effect. however, malaysia is one of the few economies where a deposit in a bank can receive a positive return after inflation  bank negara does not wish to punish savers in the same way that they do in some developed economies. like almost every investor, we believe that the ringgit is fundamentally undervalued versus the us dollar and other currencies and that over time  no idea how long  it will revert to its correct value. this has to be borne in mind when investing in malaysia, as it acts as a discount for investors, in our view, ambrose says. rhbs lim reckons that the local bourse will likely be in a range-bound trading pattern with limited upside in the period ahead. a potential re-rating catalyst for foreign investors is a stable ringgit with a slight strengthening bias adding to its appeal, he adds. at the time of writing, the ringgit was hovering at 4.20 to the us dollar, an improvement from as low as 4.4415 intraday on jan 7 but below 4.0953 intraday on feb 11. brent crude oil, meanwhile, fetched us$34 a barrel, about 8.8% lower than the us$37.28 a barrel seen at end-2015. whether or not the ringgit and oil prices have bottomed out, long-term investors would likely look beyond monetary policy to the fundamentals of companies to determine which ones to keep when the growth path gets tougher.

lumpur: umw oil & gas corp bhd (umw-og), which reported its maiden annual net loss of rm372.3 million in the financial year ended dec 31, 2015 (fy15), is unlikely to reverse its fortunes anytime soon, analysts said, given the challenging operational environment. some analysts, who had earlier expected the drilling and oilfield service arm of umw holdings bhd with a 55.2% stake to register marginal profit for fy15, are revising their forecasts to assume that the groups net loss will widen in fy16, and stay loss-making until fy18. this doesnt bode well for its share price, which is trading 65% below its initial public offering price of rm2.80 on nov 1, 2013. the stock closed 2.08% higher at 98 sen last friday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm2.12 billion. affin hwang investment bank bhd has cut its fy16 to fy17 forecasts for umw-og to a loss, after reducing its utilisation and charter rate assumptions for its jack-up rigs. our revised forecasts assume umw-ogs core net loss will widen 198% to rm130.7 million in fy16 (from rm43.9 million in fy15), and stay loss-making from fy17 to fy18, it said last wednesday. affin hwang has cut its target price (tp) to 75 sen from 89 sen for the stock, indicating a 29% downside risk, based on an unchanged 0.5 times 2016 price-to-book ratio, while maintaining its sell rating. bimb securities research is more optimistic, expecting umw-og to book a small net profit of rm25 million in fy16, and double the figure in fy17 to rm44.8 million. taking into consideration that half of umw-ogs drilling rigs are still idle, it has cut its forecasts by 80% and 71% for fy16 and fy17, respectively. the contract for the provision of naga 4 will not be extended, which will effectively expire in march, bringing umw-ogs operating rig count to a mere three units (naga 1, 7 and 8), bimb securities research said. the firm pointed to the non-working rigs comprising naga 2,3,4,5 and 6, adding that longer-term earnings delivery by umw-og seems to be in question. we cut our fy16 forecasts by 80%, as we assume lower utilisation days from 220 to 180 days for the current idle naga 2,3,5,6 and soon out-of-job naga 4, and tweaked our margins lower to 11% from 17% previously. for fy17, we lowered our earnings by 71% after assuming lower utilisation days and margin assumption from 20% to 13%, said bimb securities research, maintaining a sell call on umw-og, with a lower tp of 78 sen from 91 sen previously. last tuesday, umw-og swung to a net loss of rm372.3 million in fy15, compared to a net profit of rm252 million in the previous year, weighed down by deterioration in time charter rates and falling utilisation of the groups jack-up rigs. revenue fell 17.3% to rm839.5 million from rm1.01 billion in fy14. although the upstream oil and gas player was expected to post weaker earnings, the magnitude of the loss was way below the consensus forecast of rm19 million in net profit. it blamed the massive loss to impairment and write-off charges totalling rm337.7 million on its rigs, goodwill and oilfield service assets, which reflected persistent depressed oil prices that impacted demand for the groups rigs and services. but even stripping the exceptional items off, umw-og would still post a core net loss of rm68.1 million, largely due to a 60.3% drop in drilling service revenue and start-up expenses for two newly delivered rigs. alliancedbs research is of the view that the weak drilling market will persist, expecting recovery to take another two to three years, which may be accelerated if crude oil prices recover and stabilise above us$60 (rm252) per barrel. while it expects umw-og to remain in the red in fy16, maybank ib research takes a contrarian view that the current selldown of its shares may offer buying opportunities. following umw-ogs kitchen-sinking exercise in the fourth quarter of 2015, the brokerage house believes the bad results and tough outlook for rigs have been priced in, and is reiterating its trading buy call, with a lower tp of rm1.16 from rm1.25 previously. the outlook for rigs is tough, at least in the first half of 2016, and umw-og is expected to remain in the red, but this bearish sentiment has been priced in. securing charter remains the key in 2016, at the expense of daily charter rates. as such, we expect umw-og to be p&l (profit and loss) negative but cash flow positive, said maybank ib research."}, "159": {"date_posted": "26/2/2016", "title": "a choppy index trend", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on february 26, 2016.  us equity

to decline on profit-taking activities. the ringgit weakened against the us dollar at 4.2220 despite brent crude inching down to us$33.25 per barrel. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to its all-time high of 1,896.23 (july 2014), representing an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the following few months index price movements after july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,671.82 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,503.68 (low) and 1,727.41 (high). the indexs decline from 1,867.53 (april 2015) to 1,503.68 (august 2015) was in a perfect

also a perfect upward 62% retracement of the 1,867.53 to 1,503.68 move. the indexs next two minor swings comprised a minor low of 1,622.84, which then stalled at the 1,706.25 minor high on dec 30,

low may have stalled at 1,685.88 on tuesday. the indexs daily signals are mainly positive, with its commodity channel index (cci), directional movement index (dmi), oscillator and moving average convergence divergence (macd) indicators showing chart buy signals, while the stochastic issued a negative sell signal. as such, the indexs support levels are seen at 1,600, 1,631 and 1,655 levels, while heavy profit-taking in resistance areas of 1,658, 1,685 and 1,727 will cap any index rebound. the fbm klcis 18-day and 40-day simple moving averages (smas) depict an emerging trend for its short-term daily chart. the indexs price bars are between the 50- and 200-day sma, and this depicts a neutral phase for the fbm klci in the medium to longer term too. due to the sideway tone of the fbm klci, we are recommending a chart sell on hartalega holdings bhd. a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that 18 research houses cover this stock. there are four buy calls, 11 hold calls and three sell calls. hartalega manufactures a wide range of gloves. the companys products include natural rubber examination gloves, nitrile examination gloves and natural rubber surgical gloves. maybank investment banks analyst maintained its fundamental hold call, but lowered hartalegas target price from rm5.50 to rm4.60, as the price-earnings ratio (per) target is reduced to its mean of 21 times due to foreign-exchange volatility. its recent quarterly results were within expectations. although revenue grew 5% and 39% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) and year-on-year respectively, its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation fell 3% q-o-q due to competitive average selling costs and higher operating costs. hartalega is currently trading at an elevated historical per of 31.4 times and a lofty price-booking ratio of 5.44 times respectively. hartalegas chart trend in the daily and weekly time frames is very firmly down. its share price made an obvious plunge since its major monthly wave-5 high of rm6.15 in december 2015. since that rm6.15 high, hartalega fell to its recent low of rm4.82 this month. as the stock broke above its recent key critical support levels of rm5.25 and rm5.80, look to sell hartalega on any rally to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to medium-term downtrend. the daily and weekly indicators (like the cci, dmi, stochastic and macd) have issued clear sell signals, and now show firm and obvious indications of hartalegas eventual decline towards lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at resistance levels of rm4.85, rm5.25 and rm5.80. we expect hartalega to witness weak buying activities at its support levels of rm3.91, rm4.63 and rm4.82. its downside targets are located at rm4.48,

the struggling manufacturing sector, it said. alliancedbs research in its evening edition thursday said that dampened by the down close in the preceding day, the fbm klci had on feb 25 opened the day on a flattish note. it said the benchmark index subsequently traded to 1,672.56 as some market participants took the chance to play on the buying side. the research house however said renewed selling

and 271 stocks finishing higher. that gave a market breadth of 0.47 indicating the bears were in control, it said. alliancedbs research said the lower low on feb 25 was not a surprise because the downside violation of 1,670 on feb 24 was not perceived to be a positive market development. in the eyes of many market participants, the present market environment is treacherous.\n it is not advisable for them to hold onto their long positions for long. moreover, they knew the importance of getting the right perspective to start every day as they wanted to be better prepared to tackle the

mixed on wednesday as a late afternoon rally on energy and financial stocks led the major american indices up. the late rally reversed initial sharp losses after weaker service sector data was released. the s&p 500 index rose 9.5 points to 1,912.53, while the dow jones industrial average surged 183.12 points to end at 6,336.66. the fbm klci moved in a wider range of 35.4 points for the week, with higher volumes of 1.49 billion to 2.05 billion shares traded. the index closed at 1,656.77 yesterday, up 23.47 points from the previous day, as blue-chip stocks like genting bhd, kuala lumpur kepong bhd, petronas gas bhd, petronas dagangan bhd and sime darby bhd caused the index to rise on obvious buying activities. the ringgit firmed against the us dollar at 4.1450, as brent crude gained further traction on buying to us$34.75 (rm144.21) per barrel. the index rose on a rally from a 801.27 low (october 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014), and this represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements from july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,671.82 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,503.68 (low) and 1,727.41 (high). the indexs decline from 1,867.53 (april 2015) to 1,503.68 (august 2015) was in a perfect 1.62 ratio of the initial down-thrust from the high of 1,896.23 (july 2014) to the 1,671.82 low (december 2014). the subsequent rebound from the 1,503.68 low stalled at the 1,727.41 high, which was also a perfect upward 62% retracement of the 1,867.53 to 1,503.68 move. the indexs next two minor swings comprised a minor low of 1,622.84, which then rebounded and stalled at a 1,706.25 minor high on dec 30, 2015. its persistent weaker price action last month was in tandem with the softer tone of global markets, and the index broke the 1,622.84 support to a recent low of 1,600.92 on jan 21, 2016. the indexs daily signals are mixed, with its commodity channel index (cci), directional movement index (dmi) and moving average convergence divergence (macd) indicators showing positive signals, while the oscillator and stochastic are negative. as such, the indexs support levels are seen at 1,600, 1,631 and 1,656, while heavy profit-taking in the resistance areas of 1,660, 1,667 and 1,727 will cap any index rebound. the fbm klcis 18-day and 40-day simple moving averages (smas) depict an emerging uptrend for its short-term daily chart. the indexs price bars are between the 50-day and 200-day daily smas, and this depicts a neutral phase for the fbm klci in the medium to longer term. due to the volatile tone of the fbm klci, we are recommending a chart sell on evergreen fibreboard bhd. a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that three research houses cover this stock, with two buy calls and a hold call. evergreen is in the wood building material business. the company manufactures medium-density fibreboards, knocked-down wooden furniture and doors. its current price-earnings ratio is at a decent and low 11.1 times, while its price-booking ratio is at a marginally elevated level of 1.04 times. its return on equity stood at 10.1%. while its revenue has dropped, its earnings per share increased marginally from 3.1 sen to 3.6 sen from the second quarter of 2015 (2q15) to 3q15. there was no significant news on the stock recently.  evergreens chart trend in the daily time frame is very firmly down. its share price has made an obvious plunge since its major daily wave-5 high of rm1.71 on jan 11, 2016. since that rm1.71 high, evergreen fell to its recent low of rm1.24 this month. as its share price broke above its recent key critical support levels of rm1.44 and rm1.55, look to sell evergreen on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to medium-term downtrend for this stock. the daily indicators (like the cci, dmi, oscillator and macd) have issued clear sell signals, and now show firm and obvious indications of evergreens eventual decline towards lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm1.25, rm1.44 and rm1.55. we expect evergreen to witness weak buying activities at its support levels of rm1.05, rm1.20 and rm1.24. its downside targets are located at rm1, 91 sen and 63 sen. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed in the

760 acres of reclaimed land, including about 20 acres for the coastal road corridor previously reclaimed and surrendered as per the ca; the reclamation works that commenced in 1997 are to be completed before dec 31, 2022 in two phases (phase 1 completed); and e&o is to reclaim a total of 191 acres and subsequently surrender to the penang government (including 131 acres in persiaran gurney). the agreement marks another step forward for e&o to monetise its highly anticipated stp2 development. funding for phase 2a is already in place; the group successfully secured rm1 billion in syndicated facilities from maybank islamic bank bhd and rhb islamic bank bhd to partially finance stp2. according to the local press, mobilisation works and the installation of hoardings could commence by next month ahead of the commencement of reclamation works. investor attention will refocus on e&os ability to secure level 1 investors for stp2 over the next few months. such a move will rejuvenate buying interest in the stock, and lead to a rapid narrowing of the steep 75% discount to our fully diluted net asset value. based on our estimated selling price of rm400 per sq ft, the profit from potential

10, 2016.  shareholders of top glove corp bhd have plenty of reasons to celebrate this new year. the worlds biggest glove manufacturer has delivered yet another record profit and its share price has risen 200% since the beginning of 2015, making it the top performer among its peers. since dec 31, 2014, top gloves (fundamental: 2.70; valuation: 1.10) share price has tripled to rm13.58, giving it a market capitalisation of rm8.47 billion. with that, the company has overtaken kossan rubber industries bhd and become the second largest locally listed glove maker in terms of market capitalisation. during the same period, kossans (fundamental: 2.10; valuation: 1.10) share price more than doubled to rm9.30, giving it a market capitalisation of rm5.95 billion (see table 1). hartalega holdings bhd (fundamental: 2.30; valuation: 0.50) and supermax corp bhd (fundamental: 1; valuation: 0.50) also saw their share prices increase 69% and 93%, giving them a market capitalisation of rm9.75 billion and rm2.17 billion respectively. it is worth noting that top glove is currently trading near its consensus target price of rm13.73. in other words, the counter may see a potential upside of only 1%. opinions are divided over whether top gloves share price rally still has legs. analysts tracking the company are expecting more updates from its founding chairman tan sri dr lim wee chai and its managing director lee kim meow at a post-1qfy2016 results briefing on jan 6. for its first quarter ended nov 30, 2015 (1qfy2016), top gloves profit before tax came in at an all-time quarterly high of rm161.3 million, up 173% year on year. net profit rose 163% to rm128.9 million, representing 46% of the full-year net profit achieved in fy2015. sales volume for 1qfy2016 hit a record high, rising 15% y-o-y and pushing its quarterly revenue to a new high of rm800.3 million (up 41% y-o-y). in fy2015, top glove posted a net profit of rm280 million on revenue of rm2.51 billion. according to bloomberg, 14 research houses have a buy call on top glove and five have a hold recommendation. two others have a sell call. it has not gone unnoticed that the counter has risen above some target prices but has yet to test the higher levels, including macquaries target price of rm16.70, ta securities rm15.80 and alliancedbs researchs rm14.20. with such high target prices, it means that the stock still has an upside potential of 5% to 23% (see table 2). when contacted, rhb research analyst wong cheng horng acknowledges that the valuations of glove makers are getting higher. but this, he says, has become a new normal, considering the export-based industry is the prime beneficiary of the current exchange rates. if we look at top gloves year-to-date performance, it may appear scary. but bear in mind that the stock had been a laggard in the past, wong tells the edge over the phone. generally, he says, the glove sector remains attractive in terms of its earnings proposition, as 90% of the manufacturers revenue is us dollar-denominated. he adds that he does not foresee a correction in the sectors valuation as the ringgit, which has a close relationship with crude oil prices, is likely to remain weak. at the moment, rhb research maintains a buy call on top glove with a target price of rm13.82. wong says he may revisit the rating after the results briefing. in a dec 15 report, maybank ib research says top gloves valuation is undemanding, considering that it is now the sectors new bellwether and yet cheaper than its big-cap peers, namely hartalega and kossan. besides, its one-for-one bonus issue, which is slated for completion in mid-january, could provide an additional impetus to the share price, it says. the research house has a buy call on top glove with a target price of rm16.60. in another report on the same day, cimb research says the key potential rerating catalysts for top glove include sustainable margin expansion as shown in its latest results and improving liquidity from the upcoming bonus issue. it maintains an add rating on the stock with a higher target price of rm16. in a separate note, hlib research says it is raising its target price for top glove from rm10.98 to rm16.38, based on an unchanged price-earnings ratio (per) of 19.9 times, which is above its three-year historical average per. the research house opines that the higher per is justifiable given that the company will benefit from a stronger us dollar, lower raw material prices and improved production efficiency. meanwhile, alliancedbs research says top glove is best positioned among its peers to capture currency gains as it is most exposed to the natural rubber glove segment, where competition is less intense due to modest incoming supply. the research house maintains a buy call on the counter with a higher target price of rm14.20. however, not everyone is optimistic about top gloves outlook. for instance, jp morgan securities is neutral on the counter, giving it a target price of rm9.30. the research house says the key downside risks are a reversal in ringgit weakness, pricing pressure in the nitrile segment and negative volume growth in the latex segment. midf research has revised its target price to rm13.01, but maintained its neutral call on the stock. although top glove has been benefiting from the rising us dollar, our economist expects end-2016 to see a lower rate, at rm3.90 per us dollar. as such, we are anticipating a more tapered growth in the next financial year, it says.  note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and

malaise persists", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on january 15, 2016.   us equity markets plunged on wednesday as investors sold consumer and energy stocks after softer prospects for economic growth amid a turbulent start to 2016. consumer stocks like amazon.com and netflix led the selling in that sector, while energy companies fell as latest data showed that crude oil supplies continue to grow. the s&p 500 index fell 48.4 points to 1,890.28, while the dow plunged 364.81 points to end at 16,151.41. the fbm klci moved in a wider range of 25.55 points for the week with lower volumes of 1.8 billion to two billion shares traded. the index closed at 1,633.44 yesterday, down 9.1 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like cimb group holdings bhd, genting malaysia bhd, petronas chemicals group bhd, ppb group bhd and rhb capital bhd caused the index to fall on selling activities. the ringgit was marginally firmer against the us dollar at 4.3910 as brent crude oil tumbled further to us$28.90 (rm126.87) per barrel. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,671.82 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,503.68 (low) and 1,727.41 (high). the indexs decline from 1,867.53 (april 2015) to 1,503.68 (august 2015) is in a perfect 1.62 ratio of the initial downthrust from the high of 1,896.23 (july 2014) to the 1,671.82 low (december 2014). the subsequent rebound from the 1,503.68 low stalled at the 1,727.41 high, which is also a perfect upward 62% retracement of the 1,867.53 to 1,503.68 move.  the indexs next two minor swings comprised a minor low of 1,622.84, which then rebounded and stalled at the 1,706.25 minor high on dec 30, 2015. its persistent weaker price action was in tandem with the softer tone for global markets in early january 2016. the indexs daily signals are all negative, with its cci, dmi, oscillator, macd and stochastic indicators showing major negative signals. as such, the indexs support levels are seen at 1,567, 1,595 and 1,622, while heavy liquidation at the resistance areas of 1,633, 1,706 and 1,727 will cap any index rebound. the fbm klcis 18 and 40 simple moving averages (sma) depict an emerging downtrend for its short-term daily chart. the indexs price bars are below the 50 and 200 daily sma and this depicts a downward phase for the fbm klci in the medium to longer term too. we also recently sighted a dead cross of the 50 and 200 sma for the indexs weekly chart. this will not augur well for the index in the longer term and for year 2016. our downside targets for the index are now located at 1,580, 1,549 and 1,490. due to the weaker tone for the fbm klci, we are recommending a chart sell on puncak niaga holdings bhd (puncak). a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that five research houses cover this stock. there is one buy call but four neutral calls on puncak. maybank ib does not cover this stock fundamentally.  according to bloomberg, its price-to-book ratio currently stands at a low 0.25 times. there is no current price-earnings ratio due to the negative trailing 12 months earnings per share at -0.03. the return on equity was recorded at 11.8%. for the past four years, the companys sales revenue decreased gradually, while the net income has been stable. there is no significant recent news on puncak. puncaks chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly down. its share price has made an obvious plunge since its major weekly wave-5 high of rm2.37 in june 2014. since that rm2.37 high, puncak fell to its recent january 2016 low of rm1.34. as prices broke above their recent key critical support levels of rm1.48 and rm1.75, look to sell puncak on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term downtrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, oscillator and macd) have issued clear sell signals and now show firm and obvious indications of puncaks eventual plunge towards lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm1.37, rm1.48 and rm1.75. we expect puncak to witness weak buying activities at its support levels of rm1.17, rm1.21 and rm1.34. its downside targets are located at rm1.00, rm1.06 and rm1.32.  lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank

bhd and cimb investment bank are also unaffected, it added. \"malaysia's credit strength is a key input in moody's deposit and debt ratings for financial institutions, because it affects moody's assessment of the government's capacity to provide support to the financial institutions in times of stress. \"moody's revision of the outlook on the malaysian government's 'a3' rating to 'stable' from 'positive' reduces or eliminates the potential for a higher sovereign rating to raise the supported ratings for most moody's-rated financial institutions in the country,\" said moody's. the key drivers of moody's revision to malaysia's sovereign outlook are the deterioration in its growth and external credit metrics, due to external pressures over the past year, and macro-financial risks posed by system-wide leverage, which remains high. another reason is moody's expectation that despite progress on fiscal consolidation, malaysia's public debt burden and debt affordability will see only limited improvement over the next 12u201318 months.

valuation: 2.60) has taken steps to diversify its income streams. the group got its first break in the klang valley property development sector through the contract with kwasa land sdn bhd to develop a 3.9-acre tract in the planned kwasa damansara township for rm257 million. property is the next logical step for us. all the businesses are growing  property, o&g, which includes the supply base, and, of course, our plantation. eventually, upon completion in five to six years time, the east klang valley expressway (ekve)will start to contribute to our revenue, says roslan. azrb has secured financing for the construction of the ekve. its wholly-owned subsidiary ekve sdn bhd (ekvesb) has entered into an agreement with bank pembangunan malaysia bhd and maybank investment bank bhd for a rm1 billion sukuk. ekvesb has also secured a rm635 million support loan from the federal government for the construction of the expressway. the ekve will be the last link to kuala lumpurs outer ring road, which will connect bandar sungai long in cheras to ukay perdana in ulu klang. according to roslan, a government support loan usually makes up about 30% of the funding needed for a highway development. the rm1 billion sukuk will make up 50% of the development cost of the ekve, he says. based on the financing plan, azrb will have to inject rm400 million for its equity funding in ekvesb, or 20% of the development cost of about rm2 billion. as at sept 30, azrb had cash and cash equivalents of rm121.85 million. azrb has rm583.35 million in long-term borrowings and rm144.6 million in short-term debt, which gives the group a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.65 times  quite high for a construction company listed on bursa malaysia. the issuance of the rm1 billion sukuk will increase the groups gearing substantially, says roslan. however, he says banks will not take the project financing into account when ascertaining azrbs creditworthiness. if you want to look at the gearing level, you have to look specifically at general financing. this is project financing, it is ring-fenced by the projects cash flow. this financing will be paid for by the income generated by this project alone. of course, it will increase the gearing of the group, but this debt has already been ring-fenced by its own special purpose vehicle. gearing will increase substantially, but when the banks calculate our gearing, it will exclude the bulk under project financing, says roslan. rhb research analyst joshua ng forecasts azrbs net debt-to-equity ratio will swell to 139.4% this year from 106.3% last year. finance cost increased almost 50% year on year to rm25 million for the nine months ended sept 30. ekvesb gets a 50-year concession to operate the ekve.  besides the ekve, azrb is redeveloping the former malaysian airline system bhd building in jalan sultan ismail, kuala lumpur worth rm624 million, for permodalan nasional bhd. the project will see the development of a 50-storey hotel. in the o&g sector, azrb is expanding its bunkering and supply base business by acquiring a 51% stake in matrix reservoir sdn bhd, the owner of tok bali supply base in kelantan, for rm55 million. it is the third supply base in the country, besides the ones in kemaman and labuan. the tok bali supply base will complement the kemaman supply base. the latter is already a mature supply base. tok bali enjoys the advantage of being closer to the oil and gas fields in the north malay basin and the joint development area with thailand and vietnam, says roslan. previously, azrb owned 21.3% equity interest in eastern pacific industrial corp bhd, the owner and operator of the kemaman supply base in terengganu. in 2010, azrb disposed of the stake to the terengganu government for rm111.5 million. currently, azrb still operates bunkering services in the kemaman supply base, supplying marine fuel products and lubricants to offshore support vessels and offshore oil and gas platforms operating in the north malay basin. with the land made available by the state government, the tok bali supply base will be able to expand further to become a proper port, not only in kelantan but also northern terengganu, says roslan. the tok bali supply base has already signed up hess corp as a customer. we are very excited about the prospects, having seen the growth of the kemaman supply base first hand as well as the lucrative nature of the port business in malaysia. you dont see any ports in malaysia suffering, says roslan. over the last one year, azrbs share price has lost about 3% of its value to 63 sen as at last tuesday. the stock is trading at 15 times its trailing 12-month (ttm) earnings per share (eps), which is higher than its peers  construction companies with annual revenue of between rm500 million and rm1 billion. on the lower end, naim holdings bhd (fundamental: 1;

valuation: 1.20) and aax is not what seems. for airasia, they say the loss in 3qfy2015 was the result of one-off deductions and believe the airline is capable of steering itself back into profitability. in a nov 27 note, kenanga research says after stripping out the one-off items, airasia should see a core net profit of rm443.6 million in the nine months ended sept 30  a y-o-y expansion of 76%  and rm181.2 million in 3qfy2015  a y-o-y expansion of 65%. also, the low-cost carriers yields are up while its costs are down. yields improved 14% to 12.7 sen/revenue per kilometre y-o-y in 3qfy2015 and 5% to 11.5 sen for the nine months, thanks to higher average fares. cost per available seat kilometre (cask), although 3% higher at 13.1 sen in 3qfy2015, was reassuringly 7% lower at 13.8 sen in the first nine months. load factor improved to 82% in 3qfy2015. hong leong investment research analyst daniel wong says these figures indicate that airasia is still healthy operationally. i think you will see the effect of losses recognised in 3qfy2015 last for the next two quarters, but things are still healthy operationally. i have a buy call on the stock based on the strength of the business in malaysia and possible lower losses in the indonesian and filipino arms. wong feels that airasias plan to reduce capacity and shift indonesia aas focus from domestic to international routes where it can leverage the wide airasia network is encouraging. in addition, philippines aa is improving its efficiency cost by disposing of three old aircrafts. the company expects that both indonesia aa and philippines aa to turn around in the final quarter of fy2015. on aax (fundamental: 0.20; valuation: 0.30), midf research says its 3qfy2015 loss was within expectations. in a nov 26 note, the research house writes: the core net loss of rm47 million in 3qfy2015 was a big improvement over the rm176 million and rm138 million losses recorded in 3qfy2014 and 2qfy2015 respectively. if it were not for the strengthening of the us dollar, which resulted in its 76% us dollar-denominated operating expenses increasing in ringgit terms, aax would have been back in the black. maybank research calls the results constructive, citing a solid yield recovery trend as the main reason. for the quarter, aaxs cask was up 5.4% to 13.8 sen while rask took a 25.2% leap to 13.7 sen y-o-y. for the nine-month period, cask rose 31.2% to 9.5 sen and rask expanded 13% to 12.7 sen y-o-y. public invest research analyst nur farah syifaa mohammad fuad opines that aax will be able to sustain yields at levels seen in 3qfy2015 due to reduced competition from malaysia airlines and stronger charter flight earnings. my forecast is that aax will return to the black in 2016, thanks to low fuel cost and a sustained upward trend in yields, she adds. if the analysts forecast comes true, airasia group will be seeing clearer skies ahead."}, "185": {"date_posted": "21/12/2015", "title": "little excitement in gaming sector", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on december 21, 2015.  kuala lumpur: things do not look very promising for the gaming sector in the country next year, as consumer sentiment stays weak due to the protracted slump of the ringgit and rising cost of living in the country, which in turn could slow discretionary spending for non-essential purchases. this, in turn, may drag down genting malaysia bhds (fundamental: 2.7;

valuation: 1.4), which operates its premier resorts world brand properties in malaysia, singapore, the philippines, the united states and the bahamas, could see a potential turnaround should consumer sentiment and commodity prices recover. we see potential signs of bottoming out for its subsidiary genting singapore plc, which is still seeing sequential growth in the mass market and is largely mitigating the underperformance at the vip [players] segment. we note that there are persistently high bad debts at the vip market, but management expects these provisions to taper off in 1h16 (first half of 2016), said affin hwang. according to an analyst from maybank kim eng, another potential boost to the malaysian gaming sector would be the relaxation on visa policies for tourists from mainland china, which is expected to begin during the 2016 chinese new year in february. the easing on visa entry requirements for china tourists will be one of the catalysts for the gaming sector in 2016. however, the economic slowdown may affect the type of assets that are put up for collateral by the high rollers, said the analyst. some industry observers are also expecting the genting group to see a boost from its 20th century fox theme park, scheduled for opening in late 2016, which is part of its 10-year genting integrated tourism plan (gitp). in an oct 13 note, cimb research wrote that the gitp will entail more gaming capacity, a 10,000-seat arena, a central retail complex, a new cable-car system, parking for 3,000 cars and a six-star hotel. however, the research firm also noted that based on its discussion with the management of genting malaysia, the weak ringgit has caused the company to delay the opening of the theme park to 2017 from its initial scheduled opening. as for the nfos, the presence of the illegal gambling circuit in the country remains a persistent cause for concern, according to cimb research in its nov 22 note on magnum bhd (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 1.4). punters will continue to move towards illegal operators due to their higher prize payouts, betting discounts and provision of credit facilities. we remain concerned about the apparent lack of enforcement at clamping down on such activities. despite the occasional headline news of crackdowns, our channel checks suggest that this is not the case, it said. interestingly, one bank-backed analyst who declined to be named believes that the slowdown in the domestic economy may well turn out to benefit nfos. it all comes down to the hope factor. when people buy lottery tickets, they do so with the hope that their economic woes would disappear, and this plays out well for the nfos. for nfos in general, the luck factor remains the deciding factor as the prize payout ratio is inconsistent from quarter to quarter. however, in terms of nfos earnings stability, the top pick would be berjaya sports toto bhd (fundamental:1.3;

rate hike", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on december 18, 2015.  kuala lumpur: the rate lift-off by the united states could have a positive impact on regional countries, including the ringgit, as the hike has already been priced in by the market, malaysian rating corp bhd (marc) said. the us federal reserve (fed) yesterday raised interest rates for the first time since 2006, by 0.25 percentage points to between 0.25% and 0.5%, as it expects the us economy to continue performing well. marc chief economist nor zahidi alias said theoretically, the us dollar is expected to strengthen following the rate increase, based on the fact that the greenback has yet to exceed one standard deviation above its historical mean against major currencies, offering some room for the us dollar to appreciate. this, however, remains to be seen, as the rate hike has been largely priced in, in the currency market. in fact, based on past experience, the rate hike in the us in 2004 was accompanied by a weakening us dollar against major currencies, he told the edge financial daily. and this scenario may unfold again, largely due to better transparency in [the] feds communication. and this is positive for the regional currencies, including the ringgit, said nor zahidi. he said it remains to be seen whether there will be continued capital outflows from malaysia, due to the expected strengthening in the us dollar following the rate hike. this remains to be seen, as recent statistics indicate that the bulk of the outflows were from short-term papers. foreign holdings of malaysian government securities (mgs) have remained sturdy and in fact have risen from its recent low of rm162 billion in september 2015. if history is any guide, the rate hike will not induce mgs yields to climb as much as some people [may] think. in 2004, both [the] us treasury and mgs yields actually declined after the rate hike took place, added nor zahidi. minister in the prime ministers department datuk seri abdul wahid omar expects the ringgit to eventually trade at the 4.2 level against the us dollar, reiterating that malaysias economic fundamentals remain intact. people invest in this country for its stability, macroeconomic fundamentals and sound policies. i think this will continue. our fundamentals are strong, we have a diversified economy and revenue sources, a diversified export market, we maintain a reasonable level of fiscal discipline and we have adequate reserves, he said. the ringgit closed 0.07% higher at 4.313 against the us dollar yesterday, after touching a high of 4.3025, according to bloombergs data. on capital flows, maybank investment bank bhd regional chartist lee cheng hooi said the narrowing differential between the malaysian and us interest rates would generally favour the greenback over the ringgit. this may generally fuel an equity flight back to the us and other parts of the world from malaysia, he said. fitch ratings ltd associate director of sovereign ratings sagarika chandra said malaysia remains vulnerable to a shift in investor sentiment following the rate hike, due to a large share of non-resident holdings of mgs. nevertheless, he is of the view that a flexible exchange rate and large gross external assets will continue to cushion malaysias vulnerability to outflows. additionally, the ability of domestic agencies, such as the employees provident fund to provide funding in the event of a sell-off by non-residents, is expected to continue to support the sovereigns domestic funding needs, sagarika said. on the equity side, nomura said the fed rate hike sets up asean markets for decent gains in 2016, also supported by stabilisation in chinas growth and reduced oil price volatility. while it expects malaysian equities to see some upsides in the near term, in line with the positive regional outlook and helped by valuecap sdn bhds entry into the local market, it said outperformance is unlikely due to the weaker earnings outlook. malaysias near-term growth [is] slowing due to tighter fiscal policy and falling commodity prices, and the outlook for long-term earnings growth is also subdued. lower commodity prices, fiscal consolidation and rising costs are weighing on domestic demand, even as the export sector continues to perform well and support overall gross domestic product, it said. nomura prefers companies with earnings visibility such as banks and beneficiaries of the weak ringgit, including healthcare stocks and other export-oriented stocks. we recommend neutral positioning in chemicals, consumer discretionary and utilities sectors, while being underweight [on the] energy, staple, industrial and telecommunications [sectors], it said. nomuras stock picks include malayan

wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,671.82 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,503.68 (low) and 1,727.41 (high). the indexs decline from 1,867.53 (april 2015) to 1,503.68 (august 2015) is in a perfect 1.62 ratio of the initial down thrust from the high of 1,896.23 (july 2014) to the 1,671.82 low (december 2014). the subsequent rebound from the 1,503.68 low stalled at the 1,727.41 high, which is also a perfect upward 62% retracement of the 1,867.53 to 1,503.68 move. the indexs daily signals are all negative, with its cci, dmi, oscillator, stochastic and macd indicators showing obvious sell signals. as such, the indexs much weaker support levels are seen at 1,567, 1,595 and 1,644, while

daily chart. the indexs price bars are below the 50 and 200 sma, and this depicts a downward phase for the fbm klci in the medium- to longer-term too. despite the weaker tone for the fbm klci index, we are recommending a chart buy on ta ann holdings bhd. a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that nine research houses cover this stock. there are eight buy calls, one neutral call and no sell calls. maybank ib has a buy call on the stock, with a target price (tp) of rm6.90. maybank ibs analyst maintained its buy call with a higher tp of rm6.90. its recent third quarter of financial year 2015 (3qfy15) core patmi (profit after tax and minority interests) results of rm67 million brings nine-month of fy15 (9mfy15) core patmi results to rm128 million, meeting 103% of the full-year forecasts. both plantation and timber divisions outperformed expectations for 3qfy15 as the cost of production was lower than expected. the 3qfy15 timber pre-tax profit grew 69% year-on-year (y-o-y) and 74% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) mainly due to higher logs and plywood export average selling price. meanwhile, its 3qfy15 plantation pre-tax profit jumped 192% q-o-q as its fresh fruit bunch output increased 29% q-o-q, while crude palm oil average selling price was flattish q-o-q. ta anns chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly up. its share price has made an obvious surge since its major weekly wave-2 low of rm3.04 in december 2014. since that rm3.04 low, ta ann rose to its recent 52-week high of rm4.70 (december 2015). as prices broke above their recent key critical resistance levels of rm4.03 and rm4.42, look to buy ta ann on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term uptrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, oscillator and stochastic) have issued clear buy signals and now show firm and obvious indications of ta anns eventual surge to higher levels.

low revenue, high newsprint cost", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on november 16 - november 22, 2015.  the valuations of media stocks are attractive at the moment, with decent dividend yields of no less than 6% at current market prices. as at nov 11, media prima bhd had a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 7.85%, star media group bhds was 7.56% and media chinese international ltd (mcil), 6.71%. however, media analysts will probably tell you that this breed of stock isnt quite screaming buy, at least at the moment. this is because the print media business is expected to suffer from a double whammy of higher newsprint cost and lower advertising expenditure (adex). the sharp depreciation of the ringgit has inflated the cost of newsprint  a key cost component for print media companies  even though prices have been declining in the international market. based on the foex index, which tracks paper and pulp price movements, newsprint prices have been on a downward trend since january this year, falling 8.7% to a four-year low of u20ac436.40 per tonne as at the latest quote on nov 11. but print media companies are unable to benefit from this due to the ringgits decline, which has more than wiped out any potential gains, analysts say. they add that media companies earnings for the quarter ended sept 30 may start to see the adverse impact of the softer ringgit as newsprint is purchased in us dollars or euro. in the third quarter, the ringgit fell by almost 17% to 4.69 against the euro and over 13.5% to about 4.19 against the greenback. nonetheless, media companies have a tendency to stock up on newsprint to secure their supply  hence, the increase in cost may not be that prominent yet. media analysts say star media group (fundamental: 2.50; valuation: 1.40) has about 10 months worth of stock while mcil and media prima have six months and four months respectively. according to maybank investment bank researchs channel checks, star media group buys some 50,000 tonnes of newsprint a year while media prima purchases 70,000 tonnes and mcil (fundamental: 2.40; valuation: 1.80), 130,000 tonnes. these players source from both foreign suppliers and local miller, malaysian newsprint industries, which prices itself close to market. this will just be a short-term reprieve for them given that the ringgit is likely to stay weak at current levels, one analyst says. among the public listed print media companies, media prima sees the least contribution from its print media business, which contributes 40% to its revenue. in contrast, star media group probably sees the highest contribution  almost 80% of its total revenue. meanwhile, mcils print revenue from the malaysian and asian markets makes up close to 60% of its revenue. a media analyst from maybank ib research believes that if the ringgit remains at current levels, these companies will be able to withstand the thinner margins for another year. but any longer than that and they may have to cut back on the number of pages [used] to keep costs down, he says. according to an analyst with uob kay hian research, newsprint forms the largest operating cost for the companies print segment. for media prima, newsprint accounts for about 86% and 14% of the print segments and the groups operating cost respectively. media prima is the only print media stock covered by uob kay hian research. newspapers under media prima (fundamental: 1.95; valuation: 2) are new straits times and malay language dailies berita harian and harian metro. mcil publishes sin chew daily, china press, guang ming daily and nanyang siang pau. while the print media sector braces for the rise in newsprint prices, there is also little excitement on adex revenue. according to data from ac nielsen, industry adex was down 6% in 3q2015 compared with the previous quarter. for the nine months to september, it was down 2% compared with the year before. some improvements were seen in september, however  adex rose 3% month on month. the newspaper and free-to-air television segments have been the worst hit this year.  the newspaper segments share of the adex market is 31% so far this year versus 34% in 2014, bala pomaleh, chief executive of carat media services (m) sdn bhd, tells the edge, citing ac nielsens research. besides losing adex to digital media, bala says weak crude oil prices have forced the government to reduce its spending on advertising. the maybank ib research analyst observes that in the last three to four months, the government has cut its adex by about half. the government has been cutting back on spending because of the low crude oil prices and this will probably continue for a while. this has affected the sector as the government typically makes up 8% to 10% of total industry adex. for the nine months to september, the prime ministers office spent only rm11 million, barely 9% of the rm124 million it had spent last year, according to ac nielsen. maybank ib research expects 3q2015 to be a weak quarter for the media sector. however, there could be some seasonal upside from corporates using up their advertising budgets towards year end. for all intents and purposes, this year has been a bad year, so we would expect some recovery next year but it will be fairly muted, the analyst says, adding that he does not see any catalyst for the sector in the near term. next year, there is the rio 2016 olympics and uefa euro 2016, and any major sporting event usually augurs well for adex. however, some say the weak consumer sentiment may dampen spending. if consumer sentiment remains weak, we may see a repeat of 2014 when the fifa world cup failed to lift adex spending, another analyst says. both alliancedbs research and uob kay hian research are expecting a subdued outlook for media stocks due to the poor consumer sentiment. the high level of inflationary anxiety and further deterioration in the financial strength of consumers had resulted in the consumer sentiment index declining to 71.7 in 2q2015  its lowest since 4q2008. the weakening economic outlook and the implementation of the goods and services tax are also expected to negatively influence adex spending in this quarter, says a uob kay hian research analyst. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength,

much of the earlier rally was predicated on the scenario that bad news is good news, as a string of weaker than expected us economic data raised hopes that the us federal reserve will put interest rate hikes on hold. but by months end though, these hopes were dashed as the us federal reserve reaffirmed that interest rates may still be raised at the next meeting in december. emerging markets, including malaysia, fell sharply in response. while chinas economic growth is decelerating sharply, there are signs that the us economy was also losing momentum in the face of slowing global growth and a strong dollar. job growth has stalled sharply in the past two months, while production and consumer confidence indices are declining. for optimists, these fuelled hopes that us interest rates will stay low and further monetary easing will allow liquidity to continue sloshing its way around, and perhaps return to emerging markets. meanwhile, the european central bank raised expectations for more quantitative easing while china cut interest rates for the sixth time in a year. but alas, these hopes have since been dashed by the federal reserve. the volatility in october highlights the difficult macro-economic picture we are facing globally, with the many headwinds from china and increasingly, the us. many regional countries are already flirting with recession as the implications of china is stalling is very telling on the region. when the us and europe suffered major recessions since 2008, china had been anchoring global economic growth, and emerging markets were the prime beneficiary. chinas insatiable demand for commodities and intermediate products fuelled emerging markets, including malaysia, leading to above-average economic growth amid rising commodity prices and exports. with low global interest rates, investors were attracted by the regions high growth rates, fuelling capital inflows from developed countries. unfortunately, that story is no more. growth in china is stalling. with it, emerging economies are battling with falling commodity prices, exports and currencies. and if us interest rates are on track to resume rising  perhaps now only delayed by a quarter or two  then the structural downtrend in emerging markets currencies and equities will likely be intact, albeit at a slower rate.  on the local front, there are also few fresh positive leads from the 2016 budget, while the ongoing political issues are not helping sentiment. there are concerns the 2016 budget deficit forecasts may be too optimistic, and that may continue to pose a drag on the ringgit. going forward, there is really no clear driver of economic growth in malaysia, with slowing export growth, low commodity prices and falling consumption confidence. both the mier consumer sentiments and business conditions indices point to deteriorating local sentiment. the consumer sentiment index is now at a record low of 70.2 in 3q2015, down 28% y-o-y. notably, this reading is even lower than during the global financial crisis and asian financial crisis. in this environment, finding high growth companies will be challenging. cash is king. it is for these reasons we started this insiderasia income portfolio in may this year, to focus on dividend yielding stocks that can weather the economic downturn better. these companies must have sound business models with good brand names or market positioning, and strong balance sheets. this is a defensive portfolio where we adopt a very selective stance in stock picking. our income portfolio is modelled to be fully invested at all times. hence, cashing out is not an option. that said, we are confident that our basket of stocks will continue to hold up comparatively well. dividends are boring but provide steady income stream. most of the companies in our portfolio have strong balance sheets and are sitting on cash, which should sustain their higher-than-market average yields, even if short-term earnings fall short u2013 which probably will for the market as a whole.  income portfolio gains 5.0% in october the insiderasia income portfolio outperformed the market benchmark fbm klci last month, despite increased volatility. for the month of october, total value for our portfolio was up 5.0% compared to the 2.0% gain for the benchmark index. last months gains boosted our total returns since inception (29 may 2015) to 10.0%  far better than the benchmark indexs 4.7% decline. this means our portfolio has outperformed the fbm klci by a hefty 14.7% over the five-month period. on a monthly basis, all except three of our 15 stocks gained last month, led by cocoaland, up 16.9%. this was followed by perstima (up 12.0%) and focus lumber (up 10.3%). the biggest loser was star publications (down 1.6%). since the portfolios inception five months ago, the best performer to-date is focus lumber, which is up a hefty 70.4%. this was followed by hong leong industries (up 39.3%), cocoaland (up 20.3%) and perstima (up 18.8%). several stocks in our portfolio were adjusted for dividends last month. this includes maybank (24 sen per share), kim loong (7 sen), ytl e-solutions (4 sen) and crescendo (2 sen). as usual, we adjusted our shares held in these companies assuming the dividends are wholly reinvested. we kept our portfolio unchanged."}, "199": {"date_posted": "18/11/2015", "title": "wcts job wins

[since] the industry interacts with the capital market and banking space, trust and confidence must be put in place. that is why regulations have to come in early. the sc is the first regulator in asean to come out with regulations for the fintech industry. goh says the regulations are aimed at protecting investor interest and encouraging the industrys development. the idea is that when we see the development coming and the market is ready to deploy it, we try to capitalise on this and make it happen. at the end of the day, it is about delivering cost efficiency and giving better outcomes to investors and end-consumers. it is about getting the outcome we want, he says. goh, who took on his current role in 2007, is leading a team to help bring local fintech companies to the next stage. the growth of the fintech industry in the west has caused quite a stir in the financial services industry, inviting both positive and negative views from the parties involved. some, like the banks, worry that their business will be affected by these new disruptors, while others say the technology could be used to enhance existing services. although fintech is largely seen as a disruptor in the financial service market, goh does not look at it that way. we see it as a platform to enable businesses to deliver products and services better, he says. at the world capital markets symposium on sept 4, the sc announced an initiative  the alliance of fintech community  aimed at getting all the fintech players on board to make the conversation happen and proper regulations possible. the regulator has gone all out to attract participation, and has brought together 20 players, from large financial institutions and core banking technology providers to start-ups, in just two months. two equity crowdfunding (ecf) platforms will be officially launched at the end of the year, while the guidelines and framework for peer-to-peer (p2p) lending will be announced by the first quarter of 2016, says goh. the framework for robo-advisers  online wealth management service providers that offer automated, algorithm-based portfolio management advice without the use of human financial planners  is still in the pipeline and will be introduced at a later date, he says. local financial institutions have begun to realise the potential of the fintech industry. in the middle of the year, maybank partnered venture capital firm 1337 ventures to invite start-ups from southeast asia to pitch their fintech ideas. rhb, meanwhile, has entered into a partnership with startupbootcamp fintech to bring digital innovations in financial services to the malaysian market. financial institutions may also be interested in deploying fintech as a means to offer financial services and products to customers in the near future. for example, wealth management products currently offered by these institutions can be repackaged via a self-service robo-advisory app, which may allow end-consumers more choice in their investment mix and the ability to decide for themselves, says goh. another example, he says, is financial institutions may want to offer robo-advisory services on top of their existing e-banking services. this could help the bank tap the younger generation and keep its customers within its community. otherwise, the customers will be attracted to the robo-advisory services of other banks. based on information provided by the sc, global investments in fintech start-ups have tripled to nearly us$3 billion (rm12.9 billion). according to a recent report by accenture, fintech investments are expected to reach us$8 billion by 2018. areas within fintech that are are fast gaining prominence globally include crowdfunding, which is a way for small businesses to raise capital over the internet. [in this respect,] timing is everything; two years ago may have been too soon for malaysia, but we believe the introduction of ecf in 2015 will create more avenues for entrepreneurs to raise capital for their businesses, says goh. according to sme corp malaysias 2014 annual report, the total amount of financing required by smes last year stood at about rm91 billion. fintech can help address the financing gap faced by small and medium enterprises, which may have difficulty obtaining capital from banks. more protection for investors the sc released guidelines on ecf in february, to regulate the platform and protect investor interest. in the guidelines, it lists out the criteria for registering funds, such as the appointment of those responsible for the platform, requirements for reporting and disclosure of audited accounts as well as the obligations of the operator. the sc has put in place certain measures, such as a six-day cooling-off period for investors to cancel their purchase and an auction period for investors to sell their shares every six months. investors are also given up to 14 days to exit the project if the project or issuer undergoes a material adverse change. the regulator has also imposed a maximum investment amount for each category of investors  retail investors can invest up to rm5,000 per issuer and a maximum of rm50,000 over a 12-month period, while angel investors can invest up to rm500,000 over a 12-month period. there are no financial restrictions for sophisticated investors. according to the guidelines, issuers are required to disclose key information, such as the offering and amount to be raised, to the ecf operator. the operator, meanwhile, is required to submit its latest audited financial statements to the sc after the close of its financial year. investors in ecf platforms tend to have a higher risk appetite and are willing to invest in such platforms despite the risks associated with them. goh calls this emotional investing, or investing in things one has an affinity for. such investors are less concerned about the potential returns. they invest in a cause, and the emotional level is very high. it is not so much about the money. backers are typically less driven by monetary returns and more by an innate desire to see the project owner succeed, he says. lets say [an investor] likes the kind of watch the business is selling. although the watch may not appeal to most people, he doesnt mind investing in it because he is one of those who likes it and doesnt mind what people are going to say. goh says investors usually follow the path of renowned angel investors or venture capitalists. more often than not, he says, they pick a reputable name to follow and invest with as they are comforted by the validation that these renowned investors bring to the deals  they are not necessarily picking the product or deal itself. simply put, ecf allows retail investors to own a small piece of equity in what could be the next big thing a few years down the road  the next facebook, oculus, twitter, uber or airbnb, so to speak. platform operators are reminded to warn investors of the risks when investing in these fintech platforms as early-stage businesses tend to be very risky and highly illiquid. we told the operators that when they put [the platform] up, they have to put up adequate risk warnings and notice on their website  telling investors that they must be prepared to lose their investments. the warning must be there. in july, it was reported that a p2p platform was one of the factors that contributed to the turmoil after the stock market crash in china. the shanghai composite index in july had more than doubled its value in less than a year, reaching a peak of 5,166 points, before experiencing a meltdown and plunging to 3,507 points in the following months. the high market sentiment had prompted china investors to borrow money from the p2p platform to catch up with the stock market rally without foreseeing the outcome. these are the people who suffered the most when the markets crashed, which forced the government to tighten its grip on internet financing platforms. according to a report by the wall street journal, chinas p2p market had almost tripled in value in 2014, from a year earlier, citing the estimates of a china p2p firm called 01caijing. the number of lenders had jumped 187% to 1,983 platforms. goh makes it very clear that the sc guidelines only allow the platforms to deal with companies. as our focus is to widen the avenue for sme financing, we will be facilitating this mode of financing [p2p lending] for businesses only, he says, as this could lead to the events that took place in china.

of rm105.19 million. the stock, which was trading at about 41 sen on dec 31 last year, had fallen to 33 sen on aug 25, before climbing as much as 28.8% since. stemlifes board announced via bursa

said the takeover offer is conditional upon the singapore-listed cord blood bank getting more than 50% of voting shares or voting rights of stemlife in 21 days after the posting of the offer document yesterday. if cordlife secures a 75% stake or more in stemlife, it does not intend to maintain stemlifes listing status and does not intend to address any shortfall to meet the public spread

or rm1.35 million in total, said maybank ib. with a total of 81.74 million stemlife shares in hand, a back-of-the-envelope calculation showed that cordlife would need another rm74.59 million to fund the purchase of the remainder 165.76 million stemlife shares it does not own. the offer of 45 sen cash per stemlife share represents a premium of 8 sen or 21.62% to stemlifes volume-weighted average market price of 37 sen in the six-month period ended yesterday. maybank ib is satisfied that the [takeover] offer would not fail due to insufficient financial capability of the offerer (cordlife), and

third quarter financial results, though commendable, showed signs of fatigue in net profit growth, reflecting how much tougher the operating environment has got for banks. the countrys third largest of eight domestic banking groups  often singled out by analysts as one of the more conservative and better run ones  reported a net profit of rm1.20 billion in the quarter ended sept 30, 2015 (3qfy2015). on a year-on-year basis, this represents growth of just 0.8%, a sharp contrast with the 13.3% growth seen in the second quarter and 15.2% growth in the first quarter. on a quarter-on-quarter basis, public banks net profit growth slowed to barely 0.4%, after 2.2% in the second quarter and 6.6% in the first quarter. its been weakening since the first quarter, a banking analyst tells the edge. the earnings numbers are in line with analysts expectations, but the much slower growth points to a continued trend in the industry moving forward. analysts are nevertheless of the view that public banks 3q2015 results were commendable, considering the more challenging environment. it comes at a time the industry faces subdued loan growth, a tighter liquidity environment, weak capital market activities and rising credit costs as economic conditions weaken. public bank is usually the early bird among the local banks to release its quarterly results. given how the well-regarded bank is showing signs of profit growth slowing, it will be interesting to see how its peers perform in the same quarter. the banks will have to release their june to september quarterly results by the end of next month. public bank did particularly well on the non-interest income front in the third quarter, which grew 31.1% from a year ago, and by 21% in the nine months to date, boosted by foreign exchange (forex) income, unit trust income and a rise in fee and commission income. the most significant jump was in forex income, which surged 145% quarter-on-quarter in 3q15, with public bank benefitting from the currency volatility during the period, which led to increased customer flows, observes maybank investment bank research in an oct 23 report. loan loss provisions that quarter jumped by 144.3% y-o-y, and by 86.9% q-o-q, to rm113.9 million. of its key business segments, notably, its retail operations saw a dip in profit, with pre-tax profit (pbt) falling 10.4% y-o-y to rm862.4 million, mainly due to higher operating expenses and loan impairment allowances. net interest income that quarter was lower because the quarter in comparison a year ago had benefitted from a hike in the overnight policy rate. public banks hire purchase segments pbt fell 23.5% to rm75.2 million, largely due to a margin squeeze from higher funding cost.  for the nine-month period, public banks net profit came in at rm3.57 billion, an increase of 9.3% from the same period a year ago, coming in at 75% of an analyst consensus forecast for the full year. public bank continued to outperform the industry in terms of return on equity (roe), asset quality and cost efficiency. roe came in at at 16.9% for the nine months to date, while its gross impaired loan ratio (gil) stood at 0.53%  a slight improvement from 0.54% in 2q2015  and remained far better than the industry average of 1.6%. its loan loss coverage ratio of 130.8% was also way more prudent than the industy average of 97.6%. its cost-to-income ratio (cir) of 30.7%, though far below the industry average of 45.5%, crept up from 30% in fy2014 due to higher expenses. its annualised loan growth was still strong at 12.5% at group level, boosted by loans from its hong kong and cambodian operations, given the ringgit depreciation. at the malaysian operations, loan growth stood at 10.5%, which was higher than the industry average of about 8.2%. we observe a rise in the groups impaired loans by 1.8% q-o-q on absolute value basis. this was seen contributed by higher impairment of loans extended to the construction, wholesale and retail trade, and restaurants and hotels and real estate sectors. in terms of loans by purpose, the rise in loan impairment was seen contributed by higher impaired working capital as well as personal loans, says midf research. deposit growth at group level slowed to 9.5% and at home, by 7.4%, which analysts say is decent considering the increasingly stiff competition among banks in chasing deposits. the groups net interest margin (nim) in the third quarter improved marginally to 2.16% from 2.11% in the preceding quarter, but was still lower than the 2.29% recorded a year ago. there will continue to be pressure on nim going forward, analysts say. we expect funding costs to intensify towards 4q15, and this would place further pressure on nim. we think that this could compel management to bring down loans growth closer to the 9% to 10% level, says uob kay hian research. bloomberg data shows that of 25 analysts that track the stock, most (12) have a hold call on it because of its relatively rich valuations, while six have a buy and the rest, a sell. the average 12-month target price was rm19.02. it closed at 18.64 last thursday. despite challenging times ahead, we believe public bank will continue to deliver sustainable earnings growth (for the full year) of around 10%. contribution from its asset management business will continue to set the bank apart from peers, says alliancedbs research."}, "207": {"date_posted": "11/11/2015", "title": "china uncertainty weigh klci down; banking, plantation shares decline", "article": " kuala lumpur (nov

billion year to date, midf research said, following the foreign funds net purchase of rm62.8 million last week. however, the figure is still higher than the rm6.9 billion net foreign outflow for the entire 2014. in his weekly fund flow report on monday, midf research head zulkifli hamzah said foreign investors turned net buyers again on bursa malaysia last week, after briefly selling the week before. this made them net buyers in four out of the last five weeks. he noted that foreigners buying in the countrys stock market was moderate though, as most of the international capitals investing in asia were diverted to greater china. foreign funds bought an aggregate rm62.8 million net of purchases in the open market [excluding off-market deals] last week, after offloading rm600 million in the preceding week, he said. zulkifli pointed out that the market did not open on an auspicious note last week, with overseas investors dumping shares on bursa last monday, extending the selling phase to five trading days. however, the selling momentum ended last tuesday as foreign funds bought back local stocks in the next four trading days. the amount was moderate except last wednesday when it exceeded rm100 million at rm106.8 million, he said. last week, foreign participation dropped further and remained below the rm1 billion mark for the second consecutive week. average daily gross volume fell to rm847 million, from rm916 million the week before, the lowest in 15 weeks. local institutions sold marginally by rm34.8 million on a yet active participation rate of rm2.61 billion . zulkifli said the retail market continued to remain vibrant last week, proving midf research wrong, as it had expected the market to take a breather.  there was marginal profit-taking as retailers sold rm28 million, but trading was active with the participation rate surging to rm902 million, the highest in 28 weeks, he said. tenaga nasional bhd (tnb) led the highest net money inflow of rm15.73 million last week. it recorded a 3.48% weekly rise, outperforming the fbm klcis 1.2% gain. investors seem relieved on a (the edge financial dailys) report (dated nov 5) that tnb had submitted the lowest bid for edra global energy bhd, hence dispelling earlier concerns that it may pay too much for the latters assets, said zulkifli. petronas gas bhd came in second with rm6.91 million net inflow, followed by united plantations bhd at rm6.58 million. malayan banking bhd saw the largest net money outflow of rm17.67 million last week, followed by kossan rubber industries bhd with a net outflow of rm11.24 million, and genting plantations bhd at rm5.39 million. moving forward, zulkifli said positive sentiment towards corporate earnings could be an enduring catalyst for the market. while earnings had incessantly disappointed expectations during the last six results seasons, the current ongoing reporting season [for the september quarter] has been very promising and seems to be signalling an end to earnings recession on bursa, he added."}, "209": {"date_posted": "6/11/2015", "title": "fbm klci creeps up towards 1,700", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on

implementing different sets of regulations, resulting in industry players finding it difficult to meet the various requirements stipulated. citing the banking industry as an example, he said the industry is facing various issues when it comes to regional expansion. each of the member countries has [a] different [set] of capital adequacy frameworks, making it difficult for financial institutions to meet the requirements, he said. on maybank, he said the banking group had chosen to comply with bank negara malaysias basel iii capital adequacy requirements, which he described as the most stringent rules in the region. under basel iii, a financial institution is required to have a minimum liquidity coverage ratio of 60%. aside from that, he said the group is also prohibited from sharing customers data with its branches overseas. it would be good if we can share the information within the group, as it could help us manage our risk better, he said. this can also help us to know

have turned marginally positive, with its cci, dmi, macd, oscillator and stochastic indicators showing emerging buy signals. as such, the indexs support levels are seen at 1,567, 1,595 and 1,633, while profit-taking at the resistance areas of 1,635, 1,661 and 1,691 will cap the indexs advances. the klcis 18 and 40 simple moving averages (sma) depict an emerging uptrend for its short-term daily chart. the indexs price bars are below the 50 and 200 sma and this depicts a softer phase for the medium- to longer-term moving averages. due to the steady tone for the klci, we are recommending a chart buy on magni-tech industries bhd (magni). a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that no research house covers the stock fundamentally. magni currently trades at a low historical price-earnings ratio of 10.45 times. its price-to-book value ratio of 2.09 times indicates that its share price is trading at a premium to its book value. recently, the company announced that it will pay a dividend of 10 sen on nov 20 to shareholders on record as of nov 9. magnis chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly up. its share price has made an obvious surge since its major weekly wave-2 low of rm0.84 in august 2011. since that rm0.84 low, magni rose to its september 2015 recent all-time high of rm5.60. as prices broke above their recent key critical resistance levels of rm4.65 and rm4.80, look to buy magni on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term uptrend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, stochastic and oscillator) have issued clear buy signals and now depict firm indications of magnis eventual surge towards higher levels. it would attract firm buying activities at the support levels of rm4.65, rm4.80 and rm5.59. we expect magni to witness some profit-taking at its resistance area and all-time high of rm5.60. its upside targets are at rm5.93, rm6.58, rm7.35 and rm9.15. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed in the article are the opinions of the writer and should not be construed as

issue by nearly two months as the banking group needs to consult the relevant regulators with regards to the central bank's order to cap aabar investment pjs' subscription entitlement. recall that rhbcap had announced on sept 17 that bank negara malaysia had told the group to limit aabar's subscription option to only 15% of its rights issue, instead of 21.9% as per its shareholding entitlement. \"... the entitlement date for the rights issue has now been extended from oct 1 to nov 23 to allow time for the board to engage with the relevant regulators and to deliberate and implement the rights

at a later date, should the company require additional time to implement the rights issue. \"the board also wishes to highlight that the total number of rights shares to be issued is subject to further changes, in order to give effect to the order,\" it added. this confirmed a report published on the latest issue of the digitaledge weekly (sept 21u201327), which quoted industry sources as saying that the proposed rights issue to raise rm2.5 billion might be delayed as the bankers working on the rights issue will be seeking more clarification from the central bank. in its filing today, the country's fourth largest banking group announced that the ex-date for the rights issue of 517.7 million new shares in rhbcap at an issue price of rm4.82 is now rescheduled to nov 19 from sept 29. accordingly, the date for commencement of trading of the rights has been delayed to nov 24 instead of oct 2. the date for the acceptance and payment for the rights issue has also been rescheduled to 5pm on dec 8 from 5pm on oct 19. meanwhile, the listing date for the right shares will be on dec 21 instead of oct 30. earlier this month, rhbcap announced that its major shareholders, the employees provident fund (epf) and osk holdings bhd, have committed to subscribing fully to the remaining 266.86 million shares, representing a 51.55% stake based on their entitlements of 41.58% and 9.97% respectively. the epf is the single-largest shareholder of rhbcap with a 41.65% stake, while osk has a 9.9% interest. the remaining 250.8 million shares or 48.45% of the rights issue will be jointly underwritten by rhb investment bank bhd, affin hwang investment bank bhd, cimb investment bank bhd, credit suisse securities (m) sdn bhd, maybank investment bank bhd and public investment bank bhd. the rights issue was part of the banking group's restructuring plan, which will see the rhb banking group moving towards a \"bank holding company\" structure, in line with major banking groups across asean. shares in rhbcap fell five sen or 0.82% to close at rm6.04, for a market capitalisation of rm15.63 billion.

(state of the nation, feb 16 issue of the edge malaysia) several have come to pass. one of the most important is the ringgit. our currency slipped to 3.77 to the us dollar by end-june, from 3.50 at the start of the year, and from thereon tumbled rapidly to around 4.26 currently u2013 surpassing our estimate of 3.70. the steeper than expected fall has wide ranging repercussions on the economy, resulting in higher cost for imported input for businesses u2013 save for exporters u2013 and eating into consumer purchasing power. indeed, the weak ringgit was one of the key factors driving yet another round of disappointing corporate earnings for 2q15. its impact will be deeper in 3q15 given the steep fall in july-august, adding to already weak business and consumer confidence. the consumer confidence index has been on the downtrend for four straight quarters. as we have predicted at the start of the year, market forecasts then had yet to fully comprehend and adjust for the severity of prevailing economic conditions u2013 and that analysts will be forced to progressively revise down their estimates. earnings growth estimates for 2015, which started the year in the high single digit, have now been pared to near zero u2013 some forecasts are even in negative territory. and we may not have seen the last of the downward revisions. the fbm klci fell to an intra-day low of 1,504 in late-august u2013 well beyond our beginning of the year target of 1,570 u2013 before recouping some lost ground. the benchmark index closed at 1,589 friday. despite the share price decline, valuations for the local bourse remain at a premium to most regional markets, no thanks to the progressive earnings cuts. in other words, there is no bargain across the board and stock selection is still paramount.  on the external front, the unfolding slowdown in china has been the main catalyst for the recent global market selloff. china has been the sole engine driving global growth for the better part of the past decade as economies of the developed world floundered. japan and europe are still struggling to gain traction despite flooding their markets with massive liquidity. whilst the us economy is now showing promising signs of strengthening recovery, growth, thus far, has been patchy. this lack of a clear growth driver for the foreseeable future sent commodities tumbling to multi-year lows, which in turn, is exerting downward pressure on export-dependent economies and currencies of most emerging markets. this transition to a new, lower growth norm may have some ways to go.  we forecasted prices for brent crude and crude palm oil (cpo) at us$55 per barrel and rm2,100 per tonnes, respectively. the former averaged roughly us$56.50 per barrel in the first eight months of the year and is currently hovering around us$50. cpo, meanwhile, averaged rm2,190 per tonne and is now trading closer to rm2,000. weak commodity prices have been the other major earnings dampener in the latest 2q15 results, particularly for the oil and gas as well as plantation sectors. at this point, few expect a material and broad-based recovery in the near to medium term. coming back to our portfolio. we received dividends from crescendo, focus lumber, kim loong and perstima in august u2013 all of which have been reinvested into shares of the respective companies. we sold our entire investment in msm and acquired 4,699 shares in snacks and candy maker, cocoaland at rm2.63 apiece. msm reported a relatively good set of 2q15 results u2013 net profit for 1h15 was up 11% even though sales was flat, thanks to lower raw sugar prices. the company should continue paying dividends u2013 which totalled 24 sen per share in 2014 u2013 but future payout may be capped due to its huge expansion plans. capex is estimated at over rm1 billion for a new refinery, targeted for completion by end-2017. this is starting to reflect in its balance sheet, where a net cash of rm222 million at end-2014 has turned into net debt of rm109 million at end-june. cocoaland, we believe, has better prospects in terms of raising dividends going forward in line with projected earnings growth. the company reported strong 1h15 results with net profit almost doubling to rm15.6 million on the back of 4.1% increase in turnover, primarily from export. the sharp margin improvement was attributed to forex gains u2013 export accounts for some 60% of total sales u2013 as well as lower raw material prices as commodities slumped. for instance, sugar prices u2013 a key raw material u2013 are hovering around 11 us cents per pound, compared with the average of about 15 cents in the last 12 months. the company also gains economies of scale as sales for its main product, fruit gummy, grows following recent capacity expansion. utilisation is running at just over half currently. cocoaland shares will trade ex-entitlement for 22.5 sen per share dividend on sept 8, including 20 sen special dividend. dividend payout ranged between 50-60% of earnings in the past five years. other stocks that will trade ex-entitlement for dividends in september include panamy (rm1.27 per share), magnum (5 sen), star (9 sen) and carlsberg (5 sen). looking further ahead, we expect kim loong and crescendo to announce interim dividends along with their 2qfyjan2016 results later this month. maybank should also announce the ex-date for its 24 sen per share interim dividend soon.

fbm klci", "article": " us markets rebounded on wednesday as the august automatic data processing data showed businesses adding 190,000 workers. the august figure improved on the july job figure of 177,000, but was below the 200,000 forecast by economists surveyed by bloomberg. the s&p 500 index gained 35.01 points to 1,948.86, while the dow rose 293.03 points to end at 16,351.38. in malaysia, the fbm klci moved in a wide range of 76.59 points for the week with lower volumes of 1.71 billion to 2.06 billion shares traded. the index closed at 1,602.75 yesterday, up 12.56 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like british american tobacco (m) bhd, cimb group holdings bhd, genting bhd, genting malaysia bhd and sime darby bhd caused the index to rise on some rebound buying activities. the ringgit was slightly weaker against the us dollar at 4.2485 as brent crude rose to us$49.60 (rm209.80) per barrel. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,837.28 (low), 1,879.62 (high), 1,766.22 (low), 1,858.09 (high), 1,671.82 (low), 1,810.21 (high), 1,706.18 (low), 1,831.41 (high), 1,774.30 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,685.03 (low), 1,744.19 (high), 1,503.68 (low) and 1,660.22 (high). most of the indexs daily signals have turned negative, with its cci, dmi, stochastic and oscillator indicators showing very bad sell readings. as such, the indexs support levels are seen at the 1,503, 1,568 and 1,600 levels, while very heavy selling in the resistance areas of 1,605, 1,660 and 1,685 will cap any index rebound. the medium-term downside targets for the index still remain at 1,448 and 1,414. the klcis 18-day and 40-day simple moving averages (smas) depict mild sideways trend for its short-term daily chart, while the 50-day and 200-day smas have intersected with a death cross as well. therefore, this will not augur well for the index in the medium to longer term. furthermore, the klci broke a very critical neckline support of a major head and shoulder pattern on aug 10. the implied target of such a breakdown pitches the medium-term downside target at 1,448 despite its current minor rebound phase that began on aug 25 from the 1,503.68 low. due to the volatile tone for the klci, we recommend a chart sell on alliance financial group bhd (afg). a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that 16 research houses cover the stock, with six buy calls, nine hold calls and one sell call. the maybank investment bank bhd analyst has a hold call on afg despite its first quarter of financial year 2016 core net profit of rm122 million coming out below expectations at 21% of his full-year forecast. a key disappointment was higher-than-expected provisions. he lowered afgs target price from rm4.70 to rm4. afg currently trades at a low historical price-earnings ratio of 10.5 times. its price-to-book value ratio of 1.23 times indicates that its share price is trading at a minor premium to its book value. afgs chart trend in the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly down. its share price made an obvious plunge since its major weekly wave-c high of rm5.26 in july 2013. since that rm5.26 high, afg tumbled to its august 2015 low of rm3.40. as prices broke above its recent key critical support levels of rm4 and rm4.32, look to sell afg on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to medium-term downtrend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi and oscillator) have issued clear sell signals and now depict firm indications of afgs eventual plunge towards lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm3.62, rm4 and rm4.32. we expect afg to witness weaker buying in its support areas of rm2.88, rm3.28 and rm3.40. its downside targets are located at rm3.04, rm2.91 and rm2.45. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed in the article are the

forthcoming, hence the take-up of the rig. otherwise, in a soft market condition, a rig operator can delay the delivery up to one to three years, liaw reckoned. alliancedbs research analyst arhnue tan

slower growth track continued to take centre stage in the investing community. chinas official purchasing managers indexs drop to 49.7 in august, was seen as evidence of an economic slowdown. meanwhile, manufacturing sector growth in the united states slowed to its weakest pace in more than two years which also posed a concern. on the home front, equity strategists started cutting their year-end target for the fbm klci following the disappointing corporate results for the financial quarter ended june 30. yesterday, the klci dropped below the 1,600 level again. the benchmark index shed 19.02 points or 1.2% to 1,590.19 points. oil prices made a u-turn falling back to below us$50 (rm211) per barrel, dampening the local sentiment further. west texas intermediate october crude fell 2.16% to us$44.43 per barrel, while brent crude declined 1.57% to us$48.78 per barrel. hlib research has cut its year-end target to 1,710 against a forecast of 1,880 previously amid anticipation of a contraction in earnings per share (eps) for 2015. post-reporting season earnings revisions, the 2015 eps is now expected to contract by 1.6% (versus a growth of 2.6%), the second consecutive year of contraction. however, due to a lower base, the 2016 eps growth has been revised higher to 8.3%. with contraction in the 2015 eps, as well as lingering external and internal uncertainties, fbm klci year-end target has been lowered to 1,710, based on lowered 15 times 2016 earnings, said hlib research. on the other hand, cimb investment bank bhd expects the 2015 eps to fall 1.4% compared with its forecast of 2.6% earlier, and has reduced its year-end target to 1,700 points from 1,800 points. in view of the earnings cuts, our end-2015 klci target has been lowered from 1,800 points to 1,700 points, based on an unchanged 15.5 times price-earning ratio target. we introduce our end-2016 klci target of 1,850 times, based on the same target basis. our preferred sectors remain the construction and utilities sector, and selective smaller-cap stocks, said cimb. ta securities also revised down its target for the klci to 1,710 from 1,810, and downgraded earnings forecasts for 2015 and 2016 by 3.8% and 3.2% respectively. with the revisions, we now expect 2015 earnings to grow by only 2% year-on-year (y-o-y). the 2016 earnings are projected to grow by 12.3% y-o-y, mostly on the assumption that the economic cycle and commodity prices will gradually recover, benefiting sectors such as banking, oil and gas, and plantation, said the research house. maybank investment bank bhd has a gloomier outlook on the klci, cutting its end-2015 target to 1,610 from 1,830, saying that its initial target was unrealistic. the research house also introduced an end-2016 target of 1,750 points, assuming the political environment in malaysia quietens down as 2015 ends. a more defined target for end-2016 would depend on several factors which are still volatile at this juncture. our base case

"1/9/2015", "title": "companies foreign borrowings in the spotlight", "article": " sharp depreciation of the ringgit and waning confidence in economic growth are not a good combination. the sharp fall of the ringgit against the us dollar brings back memories of conglomerates with high foreign currency-denominated borrowings becoming cash-strapped as a result of soaring interest expenses. so far, analysts have not raised any red flags, but some have noted that companies with exposure to foreign borrowings would likely see lumpy foreign exchange losses in the coming financial quarters. take press metal bhd, for example. the group recognised rm97 million in unrealised foreign exchange loss for the quarter ended march 31, 2015 because of rm1.26 billion in us dollar-denominated debts. the groups foreign currency borrowings make up almost 68% of gross debts. without the foreign exchange losses, profit before tax would have been rm167.2 million, instead of rm70.2 million. however, the exchange losses that companies will be booking are only paper losses for the time being  hence, they are booked as an unrealised loss. operationally, press metals earnings are improving, up from rm40.6 million the previous year as it recovers from the forced shutdown of the mukah smelting plant. the higher interest rates on us dollar-denominated borrowings shouldnt present a problem either, as press metals receivables are primarily in us dollars, too, and will act as a natural hedge. that said, the ringgit has weakened by 10% since march 31, which means more foreign exchange losses. yet, press metals over rm1 billion in us dollar-denominated debt is in fact relatively small compared with the conglomerates that are listed on bursa malaysia. the sheer size of debts taken on by these giants (see table 1) might seem alarming, but most of them have relatively reliable cash flows. this is unlike in 1998, when most companies were financially stressed because of the mismatch between ringgit revenue and foreign currency-denominated loans. take ytl corp bhd, its subsidiary ytl power international bhd, tenaga nasional bhd (tnb) and malakoff corp bhd. these utility companies have high borrowings but they have steady cash flow. while these utilities may have to bear some foreign currency losses in the near term, their cash flows from operations should be sufficient to cover their debt obligations. ytl power (fundamental: 1.20; valuation: 2.40) and malakoff have the added advantage of not being exposed to fluctuations in fuel costs that tnb bears. that said, tnb (fundamental: 1.30; valuation: 2.40) gets aaa ratings for its borrowings because it controls a structural monopoly of the transmission and distribution of electricity. when it comes to high debt levels, the real concern is over companies whose businesses could be disrupted by a sudden downturn in the business cycle, or those that have a big mismatch between the currency of revenue and the currency of their debts  airlines, for instance. over 80% of airasia bhds (fundamental: 0.20; valuation: 1.40) rm11.81 billion debts were in us dollars as at december 2014. since the beginning of this year, the ringgit has depreciated 15% to 4.02 against the us dollar. the weakening ringgit creates a headache for airasia. however, low jet fuel prices will be a panadol to help ease the headache, notes maybank investment bank aviation analyst mohshin aziz. in the first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1qfy2015), airasia saw an unrealised loss on foreign exchange of rm536.1 million arising from its borrowings. fortunately, due to the groups hedging, the net foreign exchange loss was rm350.1 million, including rm11.13 million in realised foreign exchange losses. airasia had hedged 43% of its us dollar-denominated borrowings. while the low-cost carriers bottom line will be hit by losses on foreign currency translation, it should not affect the companys core earnings, says mohshin. of course, there will be a translation loss, but we dont look at it when it comes to core earnings. the us dollar borrowings that airasia has are for 12 years or more ... plenty of time for the ringgit to rebound, he points out. in the meantime, airasias cash flow should cover the higher interest rate payments on these borrowings, he says. airasias load factors rebounded to 80.1% in 2qfy15 following the loss of indonesia airasias flight qz8501 late last year, which caused a fall in ticket sales in 1q. sapurakencana petroleum bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 0.80) is the only non-utility in the top five companies with the most borrowings. the oil and gas services provider has over rm15.56 billion in net debt, a net gearing of 128%. it has over rm13.9 billion in us dollar-denominated debts or 81.6% of gross debts. in the near term, foreign exchange losses are expected to eat into sapurakencanas earnings. on the bright side, most of its revenue is denominated in us dollars, which is normal in the oil and gas industry, thus neutralising the foreign currency risk. it is common for oil and gas companies to have high us dollar-denominated debts. perdana petroleum bhd and perisai petroleum teknologi bhd have 96% and 98% of their debts denominated in us dollars, respectively. however, both perdana (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 0.80) and perisai (fundamental: 0.30; valuation: 1.70) have lower levels of gearing than sapurakencana  0.87 and 0.92 times respectively. it is important to note that sapurakencana also has a much stronger earnings pipeline to support its debts, for now. the group has a decent order book of rm25 billion. the challenge, however, will be in sustaining order book replenishment, with crude oil prices averaging us$59.93 a barrel this year. perisai, which also provides offshore support services, saw a 77% decline in its core net profit to rm2 million in the second quarter this year. perdana posted a 71% drop in core net profit to rm6 million due to lower utilisation of its vessels. nevertheless, jobs have not dried up completely. sapurakencana last month won a rm1 billion contract from indias oil and natural gas corp ltd. still, sapurakencana has high expectations to meet when it comes to order book replenishment. analysts expect the group to bag rm6 billion to rm8 billion in new contracts this year. with oil majors scaling back exploration and production, this will put pressure on the companys heavily geared balance sheet going forward if the situation does not improve. in contrast, most of the other companies on the list (table 1) have relatively sheltered revenue streams. axiata group bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.10), maxis bhd (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 1.10), and telekom malaysia bhd (fundamental: 0.80; valuation: 1.10) have high borrowings to fund their initial capital expenditure. however, with telecommunications an everyday necessity, it is unlikely their earnings will take a big hit in the event of an economic slowdown. in fact, such companies are valued as defensive stocks when there is a slowdown.  group exposure interestingly, many of these companies with high foreign currency borrowings are government-linked corporations. (see table 2). the khazanah nasional group of companies has racked up over rm41.67 billion in net debt. with the exception of uem sunrise bhd (fundamental: 1.50, valuation: 2.60), most of the companies would be considered to have stable cash flows. still, uem sunrises gearing is relatively low at 0.27 times. furthermore, the group has a vast landbank, which can be sold to support its debts. hence, while the debts seem high, the khazanah companies should be able to weather the volatility and service their debts. tan sri syed mokhtar albukharys group of companies has a different risk profile. mmc corp bhd is heavily vested in construction, which tends to be a cyclical industry that seems to have reached the peak of the cycle. at least mmc (fundamental: 0.40, valuation: 2) has been able to reduce its gearing substantially since malakoff ceased to be its 51%-held subsidiary post-listing, allowing mmc to deconsolidate malakoffs debts from its books. drb-hicom bhd, however, may be a concern to syed mokhtar. the latest available total industry volume figures show a sharp decline in automotive sales this year. proton, which is under drb-hicom, was no exception with year-to-date sales falling 23% to 32,652 units as at april. the silver lining for drb-hicom is that there has been a 27% increase in sales volume for honda cars, which the group assembles. other marques that drb-hicom assembles include mercedes-benz and volkswagen. however, with consumer confidence hitting new lows, softer automotive sales could pose a challenge for drb-hicom, especially if it allows inventories to build up. moving forward, volatility isnt all doom and gloom for investors. while the weakness of the ringgit will hurt the bottom lines of some companies, it will also create opportunities for long-term investors who have confidence in the underlying fundamentals of companies and their resilience in a down cycle.  note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a

oversold stocks despite the initial downside volatility which was brought about by chinas devaluation of its currency for two consecutive days. the s&p 500 index inched up 1.98 points to 2,086.05 points while the dow inched down 0.33 points to end at 17,402.51. in malaysia, the fbm klci index moved in a wider range of 69.31 points for the week with higher volumes of 1.86 billion to 2.49 billion traded. the index closed at 1,621.62 on aug 13, up 11.69 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like ammb holdings berhad, cimb group holdings berhad, genting malaysia berhad and public bank berhad caused the index to rise on some miniscule nibbling activities. the ringgit was much weaker against the us dollar at 4.0150 as brent crude oil inched up to us$49.70 (rm199.29) per barrel. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo- bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 comprised of key swings of 1,837.28 (low), 1,879.62 (high), 1,766.22 (low), 1,858.09 (high), 1,671.82 (low), 1,810.21 (high), 1,706.18 (low), 1,831.41 (high), 1,774.30 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,685.03 (low) and 1,744.19 (high). most of the indexs daily signals have turned negative, with its cci, dmi, macd and oscillator indicators showing very bad sell readings. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at the 1,526-, 1,590- and 1,603-levels, while very heavy selling at the resistance areas of 1,625, 1,660 and 1,744 will cap any index rebound. the immediate downside targets for the index are now located at 1,585 and 1,554. the fbmklcis 18 and 40 simple moving averages (sma) depict a clear downtrend for its short-term daily chart while the 50 and 200 sma have also intersected with a dead cross as well. therefore, this will not augur well for the index in the short to longer term. furthermore, the fbmklci had broken a very critical neckline support of a major head and shoulder pattern on aug 10. the implied target of such a breakdown pitches the medium-term downside target at 1,448. due to the softer tone for the fbmklci index, we are recommending a chart sell on mmc corporation berhad (mmc). there was little news on mmc recently. the only obvious piece of news was that it sold a piece of land in johor for rm370 million in early august 2015. a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that seven research houses have coverage on the stock, with five buy calls and a hold and sell call each. mmc currently trades at a low historical price-earnings ratio of 11.08 times. its price-to-book value ratio of 0.74 times indicates that its share price is trading at a discount to its book value. mmcs chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly down. its share price made an obvious plunge since its major daily wave-c high of rm2.76 on april 21. since that rm2.76 high, mmc has tumbled to its august recent low of rm1.77. as prices broke above its recent key critical support levels of rm2.05 and rm2.13, look to sell mmc on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short to long-term downtrend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators [like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator] have issued clear sell signals and now depict firm indications of mmcs eventual plunge towards lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm1.84, rm2.13 and rm2.55. we expect mmc to witness weaker buying at its support areas of rm1.42, rm1.58 and rm1.77. its downside targets are located at rm0.59, rm1.12 and rm1.28. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed in the

to the first quarter of 2015, where net profit rose 4.7% to rm 1.7 billion. as competition for deposits heat up, maybank has a well-balanced source of funding which results in stable net interest margins, unlike many smaller banks, whose margins have been contracting sharply. maybanks loan book has continued to grow strongly, up 14.4% y-y in the first quarter of 2015, while asset quality is strong with a low non-performing loans ratio of 1.5%. among malaysian banks, it is also less exposed to the problems in indonesia, and it is instead poised to benefit from its large exposure in

points since its closing of 1,725.56 on aug 5. analysts see no catalyst for improving sentiment in the immediate term for the fbm klci, which has declined 6.07% year to date, as political uncertainty and weakening growth at home take hold. the ringgit continued to slide to 3.9300 per us dollar yesterday, the weakest level since sept 2, 1998, on worries surrounding the direction of the ringgit following bank negara malaysias (bnm) announcement of a decline in international reserves. last friday, the central bank announced that its international reserves shrank to us$96.7 billion as at july

4.5% in may. inter-pacific securities head of research pong teng siew blamed the weak performance of malaysian stocks on the weakening ringgit, coupled with bnms recent announcement of falling international reserves. but with such a significant drop, he said a rebound would usually follow as selling activity eases. pong noted that the index may find short-term support at the 1,639 level. the current developments in malaysia are unfavourable (to the market). from the looks of it, the malaysian market is posting among the biggest drops in the region, which suggests that the fbm klcis decline may be due to factors unique to malaysia, pong told the digitaledge daily. although the fbm klci could stage a rebound in the near term after todays [yesterdays] fall, it might not be sustainable as concerns still remain, he added. he sees short-term trading opportunities surfacing over the next few days. ta securities research head kaladher govindan advises investors to invest in stocks in defensive sectors such as telecommunications and utilities, as these stocks provide stable returns. due to the current volatile situation, investors should go for defensive stocks such as telekom malaysia bhd (fundamental: 0.8; valuation: 1.1) and tnb (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 2.4) as these stocks give stable returns, he said. kaladher is maintaining a subdued outlook on the local market, due to the falling ringgit and the exit of foreign capital, noting that malaysias bond market has also been impacted following the exit of foreign investors. while affin hwang capital research analyst kevin low also sees a lack of catalysts ahead for the fbm klci in the near term, he said there is still light at the end of the tunnel as foreign investors are seen to be waiting for an opportunity to return to the local market once the dust settles. the fbm klcis defensiveness appeared to be appealing given the volatility in north asian markets. in terms of stock ideas, there is surprisingly a lot of interests in the small-cap space. clients are already familiar with our glove and technology names such as inari amertron bhd and globetronics technology bhd, but our scicom

bhd (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 0.8), digi.com bhd (fundamental: 1.35; valuation: 1.5), gamuda bhd (fundamental: 1.8; valuation: 2.0). and ihh healthcare (fundamental: 1.65; valuation: 0.5). for small- to medium-cap stocks, the research houses picks are top glove corp bhd (fundamental: 2.5; valuation: 1.1), aeon credit service (m) bhd (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 2.1), pavilion real estate investment trust (fundamental: 2.8; valuation: 0.15), inari (fundamental: 3.0; valuation: 1.5), and ijm plantations bhd (fundamental: 1.6; valuation: 0.8). on the outlook for the ringgit, pong noted that the non-deliverable forwards (ndf) market saw the ringgit trading at around the 4.00 levels against the us dollar for the two months forward contract. as the ringgit is being traded around 4.03 to 4.04 on the ndf market, this indicates that the market is expecting further weakness ahead, pong said. kaladher also does not expect the local currency to stabilise anytime soon, due to the

earnings recovery is on the way for budget airline airasia bhd, buoyed by recovery of load factor to pre-crisis levels and lower fuel prices, says maybank investment bank bhd (maybank ib). \"operating statistics in the second quarter of 2015 (2q15) were above expectations and it shows that things are getting better,\" said maybank ib aviation analyst mohshin aziz in a note to clients today. the airline recorded a 6.8% year-on-year (y-o-y) growth with a seat load factor of 80.1%, up marginal by 0.1 percentage points. \"this is a marked improvement from the lacklustre 1q15 performance where load factors and yields plunged due to the negative effect from the (flight) qz8501 (crash) incident,\" he said, adding that airasia's stock provides a trading opportunity in the near term. mohshin sees airasia's load factor improving to pre-crisis levels much faster than initially thought. \"published fares during the period, however, suggest lower yields y-o-y, which is a consistent trend among other regional peers,\" he added. \"we now estimate available seat kilometres (ask) growth of 4.8% in 2015 compared with 4.6% previously and an increase in load factor to 78% versus 77%. \"we expect yields to decline by 2% as compared to flat previously,\" he added. mohshin is forecasting airasia's 2qfy15 core net profit to grow by 629% y-o-y and 69% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) to rm185.1 million, which will be the best second-quarter on record. \"fuel prices have been trending lower than expected. this would lift first half financial year ending dec 31, 2015 (1hfy15) core net profit to rm294.9 million, representing a growth of 94% y-o-y, meeting 41% of our full-year forecast and 46% of consensus,\" he added. he also said the first half is a seasonally weaker period compared to second half with an approximate 40:60 split. in view with this, the firm has raised its fy15 to fy17 earnings forecast by 5.3%, 11.5% and 10.8% respectively to take into account the better load factor and capacity deployment. \"we have also made revisions to our fuel and us dollar to the ringgit assumptions,\" he said, by imputing us dollar to trade around 3.6597 against the ringgit, while the average jet fuel price of us$81.8 per barrel. on indonesia airasia (iaa), mohshin said operationally, iaa is still struggling to shake off the negative impact from the qz8501 incident in december 2014. \"the 71.4% load factor achieved in 1h15 is well below the long-term average load factor of 76.6%. we forecast iaa will continue to be loss-making in 2q15, which will inhibit its ability to repay the parent airline,\" he said. \"should this situation persist to the end of 2015, we think the auditors will very likely require an impairment of the iaa associate,\" he added. nevertheless, mohshin believed the market has already priced in this risk into airasia's stock price. \"hence, it explains why the stock is trading at one-year forward price to earnings ratio (per) of only 4.6 times,\" he explained. on whether iaa can comply with the ruling, which required the airlines to be positive shareholder equity by end of september this year, he said: \"for the moment, we are unable to decipher whether indonesia airasia will comply with the ruling in time or not.\" airasia is in the process of raising us$150 million via convertible bonds in order to comply with this regulation. \"it is difficult to gauge the demand for this convertible bond instrument as no term sheet or book-building are underway. the current market is not in the best of health given the weak global economy and volatile regional currencies,\" he added. recall that the indonesian ministry of transportation has extended the deadline for local airlines to be positive shareholder equity by end of september. failure to comply means they can be effectively banned from flying. maybank ib is retaining its \"buy\" call on airasia, but with a lower target price of rm2.32 from rm2.45, after de-rating to 8 times of fy15 per from 9 times previously. as at 10.58am, shares in airasia were traded down one sen or 0.75% at rm1.33, with 4.69 million shares changing hands. the current price gives airasia

valuation: 1.10) undertook an exercise, called career transition scheme (cts). the scheme cost the telco rm143 million, and in its 2013 annual report, it says the cst enabled it to better align skill sets with business priorities. the operating landscape is tough for all businesses, not just telcos. but looking at that sector, the second quarter is expected to be tougher as it still faces gst confusion. we expect things to pick up in the second half of the year, says a local telco analyst. on axiata (fundamental: 0.85;

valuation: 1.70) and maxis are trading at 12 to 13 times. however, it should be noted that axiata also has foreign telecoms businesses, which could contribute to its lower valuation. it has a dividend yield of between 3% and 3.5%. axiatas mobile subsidiaries and associates operate under the celcom brand name in malaysia, xl in indonesia, dialog in sri lanka, robi in bangladesh, smart in cambodia, idea in india and m1 in singapore. additionally, the group has set up a communications infrastructure solutions and services company called edotco group. for the financial year ended dec 31, 2014 (fy2014), axiatas ebitda dipped 3.7% to rm7 billion while profit after tax and minority interests fell 7.9% to rm2.3 billion due to celcoms weaker performance, xls cost of buying axis in indonesia and the weakening rupiah. it paid a total dividend of 22 sen per share in fy2014. it had a cash balance of rm5.1 billion and a gross debt-to-ebitda ratio of 1.99 times as at end-2014. the group recorded revenue growth of 5.2% to rm4.75 billion in the first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1q2015) from a year earlier, on the back of higher revenue contribution from all key companies, notes axiata, in its results announcement. operating costs rose 10.4% to rm3 billion in 1q2015 from a year earlier, due to higher expenses in malaysia and the impact of axis consolidation in indonesia. net profit dropped 13% year on year to rm584.8 million. the operating landscape has indeed become more challenging, and this is evident in the 1qfy2015 financial results of most corporates. in a june report, maybank investment bank research says earnings growth remains subdue with 1q2015 core net profit of its research universe (74% of the malaysian bourse market capitalisation) up just 1.8% year on year, but down 1.1% quarter on quarter. it adds that earnings disappointment continues to be higher than positive surprise at a ratio of 1.8 times compared with 1.3 times in december 2014 quarter. earnings growth risks remain on the downside if the dampening impact of the 6% gst overshoots expectations impacting the consumer-based sectors and banks credit costs, as well as commodity prices, in particular crude palm oil asps (average selling prices) falling short, the research house says. with revenue growth slowing and costs continuing to balloon, many corporates are looking at managing their expenditure and productivity as these elements are within their control, says a head of strategy with a listed conglomerate. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers. a score of 3 suggests strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. visit www.theedgemarkets.com for more details on a companys financial dashboard. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on july 6 - 12, 2015."}, "246": {"date_posted": "28/7/2015", "title": "fajarbaru targets firm double-digit growth from fy17", "article": " kuala lumpur (july 28): fajarbaru builder group is targeting a firm double-digit growth in its earnings and revenue starting from the financial year ending june 30, 2017 (fy17), driven by upcoming property launches and strong unbilled order book from its construction segment. the construction player, who diversified into the property sector last year, intends to undertake three residential development projects in the country with a projected total gross development value (gdv) of rm728 milllion. its current unbilled order book stands at rm450 million, which will keep the group busy for at least the next two years. fajarbaru's (fundamental: 1.15;

the index is bearish as well. as such, the index remains on its persistent downturn from its recent 1,867.53 high in late april. upon a break of the critical intermediate support of 1,714, the index may head towards its next downside targets of 1,671 and 1,623. a pti of 79 on the charts may be interpreted as very firm chances of the index achieving the stipulated downside targets. due to the poorer tone for the klci, we are recommending a chart sell on k-one technology bhd (k1). looking at the most recent results announcement for the first quarter of financial year 2015 (1qfy15), the group recorded lower revenue of rm32.6 million compared with rm45.9 million in 1qfy14. the decline of 29% was due to the reduced demand for network cameras. the lower revenue was due to customers lowering their inventory level requirements, and also the transfer of a couple of its network camera product lines to another manufacturing partners site. correspondingly, profit before tax was also lower from the weaker sales. the lower profit was mainly due to three factors. a reduction in sales price for various product lines that were moving towards their end-of-life resulted in margin compression. increased costs from the development of prototypes and sample pitches for new businesses also resulted in diminished margins. the difference in product mix in the current quarter compared with the same period last year also yielded lower margins overall.   according to the announcement, k1 expects sales to pick up in the subsequent quarters pending the launch of new product lines, as well as sales being higher historically in the second half of the year. k1 also highlighted that the strength of the us dollar relative to the ringgit will be favourable to the group. a check on bloomberg consensus reveals that no research house covers the stock. the stock currently trades at a reasonable historical price-earnings ratio of 12 times. its price-to-book value of 2.05 times indicates that its share price is trading at a steep premium to its book value. k1s chart trend on the daily and weekly time frames is very firmly down. its share price made an obvious plunge since its major daily wave-5 high of 67 sen on may 20, 2015. since that 67 sen high, k1 has tumbled to its may 2015 recent low of 25.5 sen. as prices broke above its recent key critical support levels of 57 sen and 43.5 sen, look to sell k1 on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to medium-term downtrend for this stock. the daily and weekly indicators (like the cci, dmi, oscillator and stochastic) have issued clear sell signals and now depict firm indications of k1s eventual plunge towards lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of 28 sen, 43.5 sen and 57 sen. we expect k1 to witness weaker buying at its support areas of 12 sen, 22 sen and 25.5 sen. its downside targets are located at 20 sen, 11 sen and seven sen.  lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed in the article are the opinions of the writer and should not be construed as investment advice. please

slight drop in revenue from manufacturing activity due to slower demand from its overseas customers. however, profit before tax was higher from its investment holdings. a quarter-on-quarter comparison

currently trades at an expensive historical price-earnings ratio of 39.4 times. its price-to-book value of 1.94 times indicates that its share price is trading at a steep premium to its book value

low, ewein surged to its recent all-time high of rm1.09 this month. as prices broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of 87 sen and 90 sen, look to buy ewein on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term uptrends for this stock. the daily indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) have issued buy signals and now depict very

quarter. the low-cost airline recorded a 6.9% increase in net profit to rm149.33 million or 5.4 sen per share in 1qfy15, from rm139.72 million or 5 sen per share a year ago, as it benefited from lower fuel expenses and a gain on disposal of interest in airasia expedia travel. airasias revenue fell by a marginal 0.4% to rm1.297 billion in 1qfy15, compared with rm1.302 billion in 1qfy14. the airline attributed the lower quarterly revenue to average fare falling by 9%, despite a 3% increase in passenger volume, which was partially contributed by the overall improvement in passenger volume from china. malayan banking bhd (maybank) reported a 6% rise in first quarter net profit from a year earlier, as interest and islamic banking income grew. higher insurance income also supported bottom line growth. in a statement to bursa malaysia, maybank (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 1.45) said net profit rose to rm1.7 billion in the first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1qfy15), from rm1.6 billion. revenue was higher at rm9.18 billion, versus rm8.36 billion. it said the profit rise was also due to a higher foreign exchange gain of rm232.6 million, higher unrealised mark-to-market gain on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (fvtpl) of rm213.1 million, and higher fee income of rm151.9 million. genting malaysia bhds net profit grew a marginal 1% to rm362.10 million in the first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1qfy15), from rm358.29 million a year ago, mainly due to contributions from its malaysia and us operations. revenue was up 3% at rm2.09 billion, from rm2.03 billion in 1qfy14, its filing on bursa showed. genting malaysia (fundamental: 2.4; valuation: 0.8) also said its malaysian business revenue grew 2% to rm1.39 billion, primarily on higher volume of business, despite lower hold percentage in the premium players business. revenue from the groups us operations, including resorts world bimini (bimini) in the bahamas, improved by 22% to rm313.8 million, largely contributed by higher volumes of business from the resorts world casino new york city (rwnyc) and bimini operations. its uk business revenue, however, fell 7% to rm355.7 million, mainly due to lower hold percentage and volume of business in its international markets division, which cater to the premium players business. goldis bhds net profit jumped 71% on-year to rm33.39 million or 5.49 sen per share for its first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1qfy15), from rm19.56 million or 3.31 sen per share, as its property development segment saw a 95% revenue spike. the groups revenue for the quarter was up 13% on-year at rm365.50 million, from rm322.06 million, a filing with bursa showed. the increase in revenue was mainly contributed by the property development segment, which leapt to rm89.4 million, from rm45.8 million in 1qfy14, on the completion and hand-over of 468 units of service apartments at g residence, which achieved over 93% in sales with a value of rm157 million, said goldis (fundamental: 0.5; valuation: 1.1). karex bhd saw its net profit rise 31.8% to rm15.21 million or 2.45 sen a share for the third financial quarter ended march 31, 2015 (3qfy15), from rm11.54 million or 1.9 sen a share a year earlier, on sales of higher profit margin products, favourable currency exchange rates and lower raw material prices. revenue, however, was 4.3% lower at rm71.4 million, from rm74.62 million in 3qfy14, due to higher commercial orders received in the current quarter, resulting in longer lead time for production. the condom manufacturer's cumulative nine months (9mfy15) net profit increased to rm42.59 million or 6.96 sen a share, a 90.3% increase from rm22.38 million or 5.5 sen a share a year ago; while revenue also increased by 39.4% at rm218.53 million, from rm156.79 million in 9mfy14. in a filing with bursa, karex said demand for condoms remains strong around the world, with consumption of condoms expected to rise in tandem with population growth and increasing awareness on the importance of condom usage among the younger generations. ihh healthcare bhds net profit increased 7.8% to rm171.48 million or 2.1 sen per share in the first quarter ended march 31 (1qfy15), from rm159.05 million or 1.96 sen per share in the previous corresponding period, on higher inpatient admissions and overall revenue growth. in a filing with bursa, ihh healthcare (fundamental: 1.65; valuation: 0.7) posted a 13.6% increase in revenue to rm2 billion in 1qfy15, compared to rm1.76 billion in the first quarter of financial year 2014 (1qfy14). the company said the improved earnings were primarily driven by higher inpatient admission, overall revenue intensities and the ramp up of operations of acibadem atakent hospital in turkey, as well as pantai hospital manjung in malaysia  both of which opened in 2014. ihh healthcare also said the group reaped the benefits of its diversified operations across 10 countries, as a strong singapore dollar helped to offset the translational loss of a weak lira to the groups reporting currency, the ringgit. number forecast operator magnum bhd's net profit jumped 9.97% to rm90.76 million or 6.4 sen per share for the first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1qfy15), from rm82.53 million or 5.8 sen per share a year ago, on higher gaming profit, mainly due to lower prizes payout. magnums (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 1.4) quarterly revenue, however, fell slightly to rm791.28 million, from rm792.55 million in 1qfy14, on lower gaming sales for the current quarter, due to one less draw which was mitigated by higher sales from the jackpot game and contribution from the new game. cb industrial product holding bhd (cbip) is expected to secure up to rm500 million worth of contracts for its palm oil engineering business, giving it a double-digit growth in revenue this year. its managing director lim chai beng said the group is currently bidding for 10 palm oil mill projects, worth some rm10 million to rm70 million each, with most of the projects located overseas, from indonesia to papua new guinea. year-to-date, cbip has secured four palm oil mill contracts worth rm250 million, said lim, who expects more contracts in the next two to three months. the current outstanding orderbook for the palm oil engineering division is rm420 million, which will last the group one-and-a-half years. ram rating services bhd downgraded its outlook on tan chong motor holdings bhds long-term debt ratings to negative, from stable. in a statement, ram's consumer and industrial ratings head kevin lim said the negative outlook on tan chong (fundamental: 0.55; valuation: 2), which distributes nissan cars in malaysia, was due to the company's cash flow-protection measures and profit margin concerns. the revision of the outlook is premised on rams concern that the groups cashflow-protection measures and margins will remain pressured by intense competition in the automotive industry and the weak ringgit, amidst dampening demand post-implementation of the gst. engineering and construction services provider kimlun corp bhds net profit for the first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1qfy15) was down 25.6% to rm14.12 million or 4.7 sen per share, from rm18.97 million or 7.02 sen per share a year ago, primarily due to gains made from land disposal in 1qfy14. its revenue in 1qfy15 had also dipped 3.2% to rm322.17 million, from rm332.69 million in 1qfy14. kimlun (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 2.4) said if contribution of the disposals is removed, the group would have achieved a growth in revenue and gross profit of 12.6% and 34.6% respectively in the current quarter, as compared to 1qfy14.\n\nthe construction divisions revenue, which improved by 14% with a few large projects secured, continued to be the main revenue contributor to the group  making up 84% of the current quarters revenue. perwaja holdings bhd saw its net loss for the three months ended march 31, 2015 at rm119.57 million, on zero production and low sales volume. it told bursa that its financial year end has been changed to june 30, from dec 31, to cover the 18-month period from jan 1, 2013 to june 30, 2014, hence there is no corresponding quarter for comparison. perwaja said within the current quarter under review, the group reported a revenue of rm200,000, mainly due to zero production and low sales volume. the zero production was affected by the gas and electricity supply curtailment by petronas and tnb, at the material time, which had caused perwajas unit perwaja steel sdn bhd (pssb)'s to be unable to secure the necessary working capital for resumption of production. for the cumulative nine months ended march 31, the group's net loss was at rm233.72 million. dominant enterprise bhd (deb) has proposed a twin-bonus for shareholder: a bonus issue of some 27.5 million new shares, on the basis of one bonus share for every five shares held by its shareholders, together with the issuance of 45.8 million free warrants to accompany the bonus issue, on the basis of one warrant for every three existing shares held. deb (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 3.0) said the entitlement date for the issuances will be determined at a later date. meanwhile, deb saw its net profit decline 24% to rm9.57 million or 6.96 sen per share for its fourth quarter ended march 31(4qfy15), from rm12.52 million or 8.99 sen per share a year earlier. the lower net profit was despite a 16% increase in revenue to rm143.63 million, from rm123.74 million in the previous year. the group proposed a single-tier final dividend payment of one sen per share for fy15, bringing its total dividend payment per share to five sen for the year. full year net profit fell 3% year-on-year to rm22.43 million, from rm23.13 million; while revenue rose 15% to rm547.61 million, from rm477.73 million. deb said its manufacturing division had posted lower operating profit of rm1.86 million in 4qfy15, despite an increase in revenue, market share expansion and newly-developed products. lion corp bhd saw its net loss widen 14% to rm105.93 million for its third quarter ended march 31, 2015 (3qfy15), from a net loss of rm92.88 million a year before, as revenue dipped 6.6% to rm571.47 million, from rm611.93 million. for its nine months ended march 31 (9mfy15), lion corps net loss deteriorated 40% to rm315.17 million, from rm224.90 million in 9mfy14. revenue meanwhile, declined 9% to rm1.65 billion, from rm1.82 billion during the same period, its filing to bursa showed. the practice note 17 (pn17) company said its weaker 9mfy15 performance was due to sluggish demand for flat steel products in both the domestic and overseas market, and a foreign exchange loss of rm47 million resulting from the strengthening of the us dollar against the ringgit. the group said dumping activities by foreign millers remain rampant and that the group continues to run its plants at low production capacity, which caused it to incur losses for the quarter under review. genting bhds net profit for the first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1qfy15) went up 24.6% to rm620.1 million, from rm497.5 million, partly driven by gains on the disposal of financial assets. revenue however, dipped 6.9% to rm4.37 billion, from rm4.69 billion in 1qfy14, its filing to bursa showed. genting (fundamental: 2.1: valuation: 0.8) saw lower revenues from resorts world sentosa (rws) both the gaming and non-gaming segments; its casino business in the uk, its plantation segment, as well as its power division.

double to us$6 trillion. the seven etfs listed on bursa are abf malaysia bond index fund, ftse bursa malaysia klci (fbm klci-ea), myetf dow jones islamic market malaysia (djim) titan 25 (myetf-djim25), cimb ftse asean 40 malaysia, cimb ftse china 50, myetf msci malaysia islamic dividend (myetf-mmid) and myetf msci sea islamic dividend (myetf-msead). fbm klci-ea, managed by aminvestment services bhd, offers exposure to the 30 biggest listed companies in the malaysian stock market. it reaped 1.2% annual returns as at end-march this year. in the same period, the fbm klci grew 0.33% to 1,830.78 points (see graph). cimb ftse china 50, which tracks the ftse china 50 index that gives exposure to the 50 largest and most liquid chinese stocks listed and traded on hong kongs stock exchange, posted a 42.43% annual return as at end-march. meanwhile, the ftse china 50 index soared 25.61% during the same period. one of the benefits of etf investing is diversification. as an etf is a fund consisting of many stocks, investors will be able to minimise single-stock risks that they are subject to in their portfolio, says ong. even more diversification benefits can be obtained by investing in different asset classes, such as a bond etf or foreign market etf, that have low correlation with the malaysian stock market. no sales charges and low annual management fees mean a low breakeven point for investors, she adds. an etf is traded like a stock during market hours. for example, if a market rises during the day, an investor who buys the etf in the morning will be able to benefit from the rising prices. etf shareholders are entitled to a share of the profits, such as earned interest or dividends paid. most etfs pay dividends to their holders either half-yearly or yearly. also, the etfs underlying constituents are announced daily via bursa, which allows investors to make more informed investment decisions, she says. cimb-principal asset management chief investment officer arnold lim says an etf is liquid and flexible as units can be acquired or disposed of in standard lot sizes as prescribed in the prospectuses. the objective of an etf is to track an index as closely as possible. etfs tend to be fully invested in the underlying securities that are the constituents of the index at all times. etfs are passively-managed funds designed to mirror an index. they have lower expense ratios compared with traditional unit trust funds, lim says, adding that they provide the diversification advantages of an index unit trust fund. meanwhile, i-vcap management sdn bhd ceo mahdzir othman tells the edge that awareness and interest among the public in etfs have increased, albeit slowly. in the secondary market, there has been some improvement in the trading volume of selected etfs, particularly china-underlying etfs, given the interest in chinas equity market, he notes. investors have yet to fully warm to the idea of investing in etfs given their low liquidity trading, even though investors are generally aware of the cost-efficiency of an etf against the high cost or charges of other investment fund products, says mahdzir. i-vcap, a subsidiary of valuecap sdn bhd, is the fund manager of three etfs, namely myetf-djim25, myetf-mmid and myetf-msead. valuecap is an investment firm jointly owned by khazanah nasional bhd, kumpulan wang persaraan (diperbadankan) and permodalan nasional bhd. myetf-msead, which was listed last week, is an open-ended fund with an approved size of 500 million units and an initial price of rm1 per unit. it closed 1.03% higher at 99 sen last friday against its closing price on may 7, the day that it got listed. the fund tracks the msci south east asia imi islamic high dividend yield 10/40 index, which comprises up to 30 shariah-compliant yielding stocks including keppel corp ltd, singapore telecommunications ltd, philippine long distance telephone company and ascendas india trust, which are all listed on the stock exchanges of southeast asian countries. the distribution channel for etfs can be further enhanced by engaging more financial intermediaries such as stockbrokers, remisiers and financial planners to further promote etfs to the investing public, says mahdzir. he explains that the unit prices of etfs on bursa are made available by the market makers of the etf. the unit prices quoted are based on the prevailing net asset value per unit of the etfs. instead of buying all the component stocks that represent an index, investors can replicate and have similar exposure at a very cheap price for as low as 100 units when they buy an etf, he says.  this article first appeared in capital, the edge malaysia weekly, on may 18 - 24, 2015."}, "260": {"date_posted": "28/5/2015", "title": "maybank 1q

engineering", "article": " call it a pre-election rally or a sarawak play, but the share prices of some companies in the state have been on a steady uptrend. cahya mata sarawak bhds (cms) share price is hovering at a record high currently. the stock had risen from a low of rm3.35 in mid-december last year to rm4.96 last thursday. cms associate company, kkb engineering bhd (fundamental: 2.5; valuation: 1.4), has also seen keen interest of late. its share price has gained 23% in the past fortnight, giving it a market capitalisation of rm435.7 million. from rm1.37 on april 2, the stock rose to rm1.69 on april 15. trading volume has picked up as well with 1.3 million shares traded on april 15 compared with 88,900 shares on april 1. analysts say apart from the election theme, the rise in kkbs share price could be due to the expectation that the company would be a beneficiary of cmsrecently awarded rm308 million contract to build a world-class museum and heritage trail in kuching. cms (fundamental: 3; valuation: 1.1) is a major shareholder in kkb with a 20.1% stake. only sarawaks polls are held at a different time from the general election. the 10th sarawak election was in april 2011. the cms contract could signal the start of more projects to come, ahead of the impending state election. as we noted earlier, there is a possibility that cms will subcontract some jobs to kkb, insofar as they relate to steel fabrication and supply of pipes, says amresearch analyst thomas soon, who tracks sarawak-based companies. on the museum contract, maybank investment bank research, in an april 15 report, states that it represents cms first major construction job win since 2009, lifting its order book by a significant 51% to an estimated rm908 million. the research house points out that this could be a prelude to more construction job wins for cms in the near term, especially works related to the pan-borneo highway and sarawak corridor of renewable energy (score). meanwhile, its cement and construction material businesses are key beneficiaries of the growing construction activities, driven by the upcoming state election, the pan-borneo highway and the 11th malaysia plan, it adds. while the awarding of infrastructure jobs in sarawak is picking up, analysts say the macro operating landscape continues to be tough for companies there, and kkb is no exception. kkb has seen a slowdown in its conventional steel fabrication/engineering business, and the operating landscape remains challenging. its prospects will largely hinge on its oil and gas venture, through its associate oceanmight sdn bhd, which has the expertise and capacity, says soon. despite a tougher operating environment for oil and gas companies, we still expect them (kkbs associate) to get projects from petronas. they are now finishing their rm20 million maiden project. it has not been plain sailing for kkb all these years. its 43%-owned associate oceanmight became a petronas-licensed fabricator in 2013. being the only fabricator in sarawak, it was expected to stand a better chance of landing jobs than players from the peninsula, but so far it has yet to generate any major contribution. the sharp fall in crude oil prices, which is causing a slowdown in the oil and gas sector, has not helped matters either. kkb started diversifying, which includes its venture into the oil and gas sector, as it has a long-term plan to move up the value chain in structural steel fabrication. apart from its core steel fabrication business, it is into civil construction as well as the manufacture of steel pipes and liquefied petroleum gas cylinders.  over the years, kkbs margins have been declining, from 44.11% in 2010 to 28.57% last year. its earnings have been on a downward trend as well. for the financial year ended dec 31, 2014, kkb saw its net profit drop almost 32% year on year to rm23.9 million. likewise, its gross dividend per share decreased from 17.5 sen in fy2010 to only four sen in fy2014. even so, the group saw its cash triple to rm98.6 million as at dec 31, 2014, from rm37.5 million a year earlier. amresearchs soon observes that there has been a decline in large investments in samalaju industrial park, a score hub that front-loaded investments for the major engineering projects. what are left now are piping jobs that have lower margins compared with engineering. however, there are other growth nodes within score that can still bring in jobs, he says. what we need to see that will help companies like kkb is a step-up in rural infrastructure work in sarawak. the pan-borneo highway will help as it will be spread out evenly among companies, including privately owned entities. we do not expect just one major player to get a chunk of it. in a feb 18 report, amresearch notes thatkkbs unbilled sales stand at rm105 million, which would last nine months. it adds that kkb has bid for rm47 million worth of conventional (steel structure/engineering) jobs, over and above its earlier bids of rm130 million. we are assuming new orders of rm250 million, rm280 million and rm300 million over the next three years, says the research house, which has a buy call on the stock, with a fair value of rm2.05. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation

opportunities", "article": " westports holdings bhd, which has been growing organically via its port operations in westport, port klang, is prepared to look elsewhere for opportunities as the expansion of the port nears the final phase. ceo ruben emir gnanalingam says the port operators priority now is to complete container terminals ct8 and ct9 at westport by 2020, which will increase westports handling capacity to 16 million twenty-foot equivalent units (teus) from 11 million at the present time. still, we have to keep our eyes open for growth opportunities from now so that when the right one comes along, we will be ready, ruben tells the edge. we have not been very aggressive so far, but we know that in the next five to six years, we have to look at other locations. asean is our preferred area mainly because it is close to home. however, any plan to venture abroad might change if westports bags a contract to develop a third port in port klang, which may add an estimated annual capacity of 30 million teus to the latters current operation. the first and second ports in port klang are northport (managed by northport [m] bhd) and westport respectively. i think there is a huge possibility [to develop a third port in port klang] but its up to the port authorities. it is something they have not firmed up. i dont think theyve ruled us out but there is no certainty either, observes ruben. the government has been studying the expansion of port klangs capacity and looking for a suitable location for a third port, which could see either westports or ncb holdings bhd, the parent company of northport, winning the contract. the key is to find the right space to do it and plan it very carefully. we have to bear in mind that infrastructure investments are costly, says ruben. westports achieved a record operational revenue of rm1.5 billion in the financial year ended dec 31, 2014 (fy2014), compared with rm1.35 billion in fy2013. this was due mostly to strong growth in the container segment, which saw handling volume rise 12.1% to 8.4 million teus. net profit rose from rm435.3 million a year ago to rm512.2 million on the higher revenue. according to ruben, while intra-asia has been faring well, trading volume in australia has been normalising after a surge in 2014 and african growth has slowed after seeing strong growth since 2010. nevertheless, westports container throughput experienced an unexpected y-o-y spurt of about 17% in 1q2015, driven by the switching of alliances between shipping lines, which requires cargo from the ships of one alliance to be moved to the ships of another alliance.  ruben expects growth to normalise to between 5% and 10% by the end of the year. westports, which counts french liner cma cgm, china shipping container lines and united arab shipping company among its customers, also boasts li ka-shings hutchison whampoa ltd as a substantial shareholder with a 23.6% stake. analysts believe westports growth potential could be stronger as the port operator has developed a reputation for under-promising yet over-delivering.  maybank ib research analyst lee yen ling notes that the solid performance, which outpaces the 7% to 8% volume growth of key transhipment ports in the straits of malacca, indicates that westports is enjoying a bigger slice of the pie. a 20% to 30% tariff hike  the industrys much-anticipated catalyst  appears imminent as a proposal for port tariff hike has been submitted to the port klang authority, which could potentially give westports net profit a boost once approved. it has been 12 years since the last hike in 2003. labour and raw material costs have increased substantially so it makes sense for a tariff hike, says ruben. however, he acknowledges that preferential rates for high volume clients will still apply as the industry remains a competitive one, especially for transhipments. it is not easy to impose a tariff hike on transhipments but we need it to grow and to allow freight rates to be competitive. our importers and exporters are benefitting tremendously because of our lower rates compared with most other ports in the region, ruben says, adding that there is a need for port klang to evolve into a stronger transhipment hub to grow its margins and sustain its regional competitiveness. kenanga research, in an april 6 note, maintains its neutral stance on the sector due to a lack of catalysts and port valuations that have peaked on uncertainty over the timeline of the tariff hike. we dont think the upward revision of the tariff ceiling will translate into a linear positive increment in revenue for port operators because some of them may be charging their core clients rates that are lower than the ceiling. nevertheless, westports shares had risen 66% to rm4.14 last thursday from rm2.50 a year ago. interest in the stock had begun to grow last november. it was listed in october 2013 at an initial public offering price of rm2.50. ruben remarks that westports has been attracting the attention of retirement funds, in particular, and foreign interest since its ipo. however, the port operators dividend yield has fallen to about 3% as a result of the rise in its shares, which could be unattractive to new investors looking for good dividend-yield stocks. by comparison, real estate investment trusts (reits) offer dividend yields of about 5% to 7% or even higher. nevertheless, rhb research analyst ahmad maghfur usman, who projects a dividend yield of 4.1% for westports in december 2016, opines that there is room for capital appreciation in the company. westports has room for both yield and capital appreciation and it cannot be compared with reits  which provide high yields without the capital appreciation, he says, adding that westports current share price would be in line with its fundamentals should the tariff hike materialise. we think a premium at ev/ebitda of 13.8 times is justifiable, given westports superior return on equity, above average dividend yields and lower net gearing (versus its peers) and high ebitda margins. the research house has a target price of rm4.62 on the company. westports distributes 75% of its profits as dividends and intends to maintain this policy during the construction period of ct8 and ct9, which are due for completion in 2017 and 2020 respectively. we will be more comfortable to provide higher dividends once the terminals are completed as we dont want our debt to reach a very high level, comments ruben. at its close of rm4.14 last thursday, westports had a market capitalisation of rm14.05 billion.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on april 20 - 26, 2015."}, "264": {"date_posted": "13/5/2015", "title": "kimlun buys johor land for rm28.3m to build

status", "article": " rhb capital bhd is exploring an internal reorganisation to eliminate its holding company structure and directly list its 100%-owned banking unit, rhb bank bhd, on bursa malaysia, say sources. subsequently, the assets and companies belonging to rhb cap will be parked under the listed bank, making the groups structure more tax efficient. at the moment, various operating units, such as rhb investment bank bhd and rhb insurance bhd, are held directly by rhb cap. the bank will take over the listing status of rhb cap. one way to do this is by distributing the shares upwards, says a source familiar with the matter. this is still in the exploratory stage. the exercise could also include a rights issue. the plan for the reorganisation, should it be approved by the board, could be revealed as early as this month. there are a couple of reasons why rhb cap (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 2.4) is considering an internal reorganisation. one is the impact of the financial services act (fsa) on financial holding companies, resulting in them having to beef up their capital, and the other is to make the groups structure more tax efficient, says the source. before the regulations changed, one could claim tax deductions on interest payments on debt. in other words, there was a tax shield for income. but after moving into a single-tier tax structure for dividends last year, dividends have become tax exempt. as dividends are tax exempt, there is no income with which to offset tax  the tax shield is gone. so, rhb caps current structure is tax inefficient, notes the source. a plan for a corporate internal reorganisation at rhb cap is not new. it makes sense for the group to revisit an internal reorganisation to create a more efficient structure for the group, following the failed proposed merger with cimb (group holdings bhd  fundamental: 1.05; valuation: 1.5) and mbsb (malaysia building society bhd  fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 2.4), says an industry observer. the edge wrote in march 2013 that there was a proposal to restructure rhb cap in an exercise that entailed its privatisation, in an effort to create better value and improve tax efficiency. the comprehensive proposal suggested that rhb bank be relisted later and that the banking group be enlarged with the subsequent injection of mbsb. according to documents sighted by the edge then, the rationale for the proposal was to prepare the group for changes after the implementation of the new fsa and to create a more efficient platform for dividend payments and further strengthen the capital base. the article noted that the timing of the restructuring and whether or not the major shareholders of the group had decided to go ahead with the proposal remained unknown. when asked if mbsb would be included in the current reorganisational plan, the source says, unlikely. privatisation [of rhb cap] is also an option today but it makes more sense to directly turn rhb bank into the listed entity of the group. it will also take up less time, says the source. financial holding companies have started preparing for stricter capital requirements to be enforced in 2019, which will require them to retain more capital. additionally, the basel committee has been raising the bar to improve the supervision of financial groups globally. a senior banker notes that banks with double leverage ratios will be affected. they will have difficulty in doing what theyve been doing historically. double leverage means the holding company takes up debt and pumps it into a subsidiary as capital. at the subsidiary, it looks like capital because it is equity, but it is not. this is why banking groups that have a listed financial holding company at the top, like rhb cap and hlfg (hong leong financial group bhd  fundamental: 2.6; valuation: 2.4), need to relook at their capital position and structure. maybank investment bank research in a march 4 note says hong leong bank bhd (fundamental: 2.8; valuation: 2.2), hlfg and rhb cap are likely to raise capital this year. hong leong banks management has made known its intention to raise the banks cet1 ratio to about 1% to 2% above the regulatory minimum. the fully loaded cet1 ratio at hong leong bank group level was 9.2% at the end of last year, but it was just 8.1% at the bank level. hlfg, meanwhile, will have to raise capital as well to subscribe for its portion of hong leong banks rights, given its 64% stake in the commercial bank, the research house notes. rhb cap needs to take its double leverage ratio of 137% down to below 120% as it targets a higher cet1 ratio versus its current fully loaded cet1 ratio of 9.8%. meanwhile, a senior banking analyst notes that the hong leong group could also consider exploring a corporate restructuring apart from making a rights issue to comply with stricter capital requirements. hlfg could consider a share swap to privatise hong leong bank or maybe even contemplate distributing hong leong bank shares to hlfg shareholders. note: the edge research's fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation

as 3.05% or 25 sen to rm7.95 before closing at rm7.96, with 1.65 million shares done yesterday. this translated into a market capitalisation of rm20.48 billion. rhbcap (fundamental: 1.5; valuation:

billion for its working capital and to meet the requirements of basel iii.  in a note yesterday, cimb research analyst winson ng estimated that the rights issue will dilute the groups eps by 10% to 12% for the financial year ending dec 31, 2016 (fy16). however, he said the dilution will be partly offset by tax savings and the withdrawal of the holding-company discount for the valuation of the stock. the swap ratio of rhbcap and rhb bank shares has yet to be determined at this juncture, but we think that investors exposure to rhbcaps business profile will not materially change following the exercise, though all of its business units will be housed under the newly listed entity of rhb bank, he said. meanwhile, maybank investment bank research analyst desmond chng said the positives of the exercise include an enhanced common equity tier 1 (cet1) ratio of 11% at group level, reduced goodwill from rm5.2 billion to rm3 billion, and improved return on equity (roe) from about 10.2% to 11.2%

dilution of fy16 eps as a result of this exercise, he said in his note yesterday. meanwhile, hong leong investment bank research analyst low yee huap expects the eps dilution to be about 30% but said there is a potential roe enhancement of 186 basis points following the completion of the proposals. he is positive about the proposed exercise despite the eps dilution as it would enhance profitability and roe on top of addressing capital issues and inefficiency of the group structure. the higher roe and bank holding structure suggest that the new rhb bank entity could garner higher valuation and benefit shareholders, he added. alliancedbs analyst lynette cheng said while rhbcaps corporate exercise is positive for the group, the research firm is mindful of the malaysian banking sector remaining challenging in 2015 with moderate loan growth. she said the banking sectors net interest margin is expected to be pressured by higher funding cost as capital market slows. she also cited higher credit and operating costs due to the goods and services tax as challenges affecting the banking sector. cheng estimated that the entire corporate exercise would diluteepsby around 10% but would be roe accretive (by 1.6 percentage points) because of higher earnings from interest cost-savings and a smaller equity base because of lower goodwill. most analysts have maintained their earnings forecasts, target prices and ratings on rhbcap, pending more details. maybank ib research, however, changed its call on rhbcap from buy to hold. on monday, rhbcap group managing director

gains) shows how serious developers are in trying to sustain consistent investor interest in the cyclical property industry. with its latest move, ksl (fundamental: 2.6; valuation: 1.8) is joining a handful of mid-tier property players that have committed themselves to a somewhat generous dividend policy. for example, penang-based tambun indah land bhd (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 2.4) and negeri sembilan-based matrix concepts holdings bhd (fundamental: 2.6; valuation: 2.4) pay out a minimum 40%. other examples are johor-based plastics manufacturer-cum-developer scientex bhd (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 2.4) and i-bhd (fundamental: 3; valuation: 3)  the master developer of i-city in shah alam  which pay out 40% and 30% respectively. not many small and medium property players have a dividend policy because property-related earnings tend to be cyclical and can be unpredictable. perhaps, ksl can commit to this because it is strengthening its recurring income base, says an analyst. interestingly, ksl only resumed paying dividends in the financial year ended dec 31, 2014 (fy2014), after not declaring any from fy2011 to fy2013. according to the groups presentation to investors, the fy2014 dividend amounted to rm93.1 million or 10 sen per share, representing a payout of close to 36.3% of net operating profit. based on ksls share price of rm2.11 last friday, the 10 sen dividend translates into a yield of 4.7%. with the latest dividend policy of at least a 40% payout, analysts estimate ksls dividend yield to increase to 6.4%. in a recent report, kenanga

distributable reserves and tax credits, future operating conditions, future expansion, capital expenditure and investment plans. last year, ksl introduced a dividend reinvestment plan (drip) under which shareholders were given the option to either reinvest part of the dividend paid or all of it. they could opt to reinvest the cash dividend in buying ksl shares at a discounted price, thus enabling the company to retain more cash. ksl is in the midst of growing its recurring income base, which has accounted for about 20% of its earnings historically, by deriving more revenue from its property investment segment. its fy2014 results indicate that property investment contributed a segmental profit of rm181 million  up 69% from rm107.1 million in fy2013  or 42% of the groups pre-tax profit of rm429.6 million. ksl owns ksl city, an integrated development comprising ksl shopping mall and ksl hotel & resort, in the heart of johor baru, and other investment properties such as

grew 87.4% to rm340.2 million from rm181.5 million the year before while revenue rose 17.8% to rm801 million. the earnings included a revaluation of investment properties amounting to rm88.2 million. in tandem with its strong financial performance, ksls shares rose from rm1.66 on jan 6 to close at rm2.11 last friday, giving the company a market capitalisation of rm1.97 billion. the stock hit a high of rm2.38 last september before surrendering the gains in a general market selldown triggered by a sharp fall in crude oil prices and the ringgit. however, while things look positive for ksl, a number of analysts feel the overall outlook for the property sector is negative right now. the operating environment is currently tough for property developers. we expect top-line demand to weaken in certain segments, such as high-rises in the klang valley and properties in iskandar malaysia, due to oversupply. that, coupled with escalating costs, could put some developers at risk. so, it all boils down to the individual developer  how strong its balance sheet, margins and product mix are, says an analyst. maybank investment bank research notes in a feb 8 report that there will likely be a lull in demand post-implementation of the goods and services tax that could last 9 to 12 months due to affordability issues, subdued buyer sentiment and lack of interest in big-ticket items. weak buying sentiment and higher operating costs post-gst are the key issues for developers, it says, adding that the property sector lacks re-rating catalysts at the moment. nevertheless, with a low land holding cost and its own construction arm, ksl has been able to attain better margins than its peers. between fy2010 and fy2014, its gross margin was between 54% and 60%, making it the most likely to weather the current tough times. besides, management has shared that it still had unbilled sales of rm1.02 billion as at end-2014, equivalent to more than a years revenue. note: the edge research's

lumpur (apr 14): while analysts were mostly positive on rhb capital bhd (rhbcap)s proposed internal restructuring and rights issue, the dilutive effect on earnings per share (eps)  expected to range between 10% and 30%  weighed on its share price today. rhbcaps share price fell as much as 3.05% or 25 sen to rm7.95 before closing at rm7.96, with 1.65 million shares done. this translated to a market capitalisation of rm20.48 billion. rhbcap (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 2.1) proposed yesterday an internal reorganisation that will see rhb bank bhd take over its parents listing status. the group has also proposed a rights issue of new shares to raise up to rm2.5 billion for its working capital and to meet the requirements of basel iii.  in a note today, cimb research analyst winson ng estimated that the rights issue will dilute the groups financial year (fy16) earnings per share (eps) by 10% to 12%. however, he said the dilution will be partly offset by tax savings and the withdrawal of the holding-company discount for the valuation of the stock.  the swap ratio of rhbcap and rhb bank shares has yet to be determined at this juncture, but we think that investors exposure to rhbcaps business profile will not materially change following the exercise, though all of its business units will be housed under the newly listed entity of rhb bank, he added.  meanwhile, maybank investment bank research analyst desmond chng said the positives of the exercise include an enhanced common equity tier 1 (cet1) ratio of 11% at group level, reduced goodwill from about rm3 billion to rm5.2 billion, improved return on equity (roe) from about 10.2% to 11.2% for financial year ending dec 31, 2016 (fy16). he said that the exercise would eliminate the groups double leverage problem and reduce interest costs and uplift earnings of about rm120 million per annum. on the flip side, we estimate a 29% dilution of fy16 eps as a result of this exercise, he added in his note today. meanwhile, hong leong investment bank analyst low yee huap expects the eps dilution to be about 30% but said there is a potential roe enhancement of 186 basis points following the completion of the proposals. he is positive on the proposed exercise despite the eps dilution as it would enhance profitability and roe on top of addressing capital issue and inefficiency of the group structure. he said in a note that the higher roe and bank holding structure suggest that the new rhb bank entity could garner higher valuation and benefit shareholders. with the bank holding structure and stronger capital position, he added that there is potential of higher payout and flexibility to increase cash portion. alliancedbs analyst lynette cheng said while rhbcap's corporate exercise is positive for the group, the research firm was mindful that the malaysian banking sector remained challenging in 2015 with moderate loan growth. in her report today, she said she expects the banking sector's net interest margin to be pressured by higher funding cost as capital market slows. furthermore, it also cited higher credit costs and operating costs due to the goods and services tax as challenges affecting the banking sector. pricing of the rights will be determined later but the management has hinted at a 20% to 30% discount to rhbcaps share price, she added. she estimated the entire corporate exercise would dilute eps by around 10% but would be roe accretive (by 1.6 percentage points) because of higher earnings from interest cost-savings and smaller equity base because of lower goodwill. most analysts have maintained their earnings forecasts, target price and rating on rhbcap, pending more details. yesterday, rhbcap group managing director kellee kam said the restructuring would see the group move towards a bank holding company structure in line with major regional banking groups across association of southeast asian nations. kam said the move would also give rhbcap better capital and tax efficiency for profit growth. the proposals are expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2015.

[as for the] private sector, we dont know if it will be a smooth ride. but it is certainly something we want to put our money into because of the potential. according to munirah, the potential lies in having a discerning investing public. even with the aec, investors will continue to choose consistent portfolio managers and fund houses with good track records.\n[for example, we have] a full-fledged investment team who speak the local language, study the local companies and get firsthand news from local regulators, she says. we are a bottom-up stock picker, which is something a lot of companies do. but [the fact that we are] close to the ground is very advantageous. in anticipation of the aec, the securities commission malaysia announced on feb 28 that cimb-principal and maybank asset management sdn bhd had received approval to launch funds under the asean qualifying collective investment scheme. cimb-principal, which was the first to receive approval, launched the cimb-principal asean total return fund earlier this month. the fund targets a return of 9% over the medium to long term by investing in companies with above average growth potential. the fund is suitable for investors with a moderate risk profile. the minimum initial investment is rm500 or us$200. we expect to see rm300 million in sales, says munirah. maybank asset managements maybank bosera greater china asean equity-i is an islamic fund. it is a collaborative effort between maybank asset management and hong kong-based bosera asset management. the two companies announced at the end of last year that they would be looking to launch a fund in the first quarter of this year that will invest in shariah-compliant equities and equity-related securities with a focus on asean and the greater china region. the companies share the belief that while hong kong can leverage malaysias islamic fund management capabilities, malaysia stands to benefit from hong kongs strength as an international financial centre. the move is expected to promote the asean-greater china strategic partnership and build on the bilateral trade between the two regions. it was also announced that the monetary authority of singapore (mas) had approved three other funds  maybank asset management singapore pte ltds maybank asian equity fund and maybank asian income fund as well as nikko asset management asia ltds singapore dividend equity fund. how will malaysian investors feel about the liberalisation of the market? munirah believes local investors will embrace it as many of them already have diversified investment options beyond malaysia. today, a typical malaysian investor will have malaysian assets and liabilities to fund. but increasingly, they also have us dollar, british pound or australian dollar liabilities, she says, adding that a liberalised market should be a natural fit for this type of investors because they have exposure to foreign currencies and want exposure in different markets. malaysia is probably ready for more funds to come to our shores. but investors may have to be quite careful with unfamiliar names, she says. munirah is a strong advocate of good customer service. as products become more homogenous these days, there is no way players can compete on pricing alone, she says. hence, it is important for a fund house to have that local touch so that the customer experience can be enhanced. we are culturally more sensitive to the markets we are in, she adds. for a regional player like maybank, the next step would be to enhance its presence in the right market. its presence as the only asean bank in all 10 asean countries is an advantage. since the group has strong balance sheets, lee says it is always looking to grow its footprint and will consider inorganic growth for its private banking segment. as we speak, we are rolling out [our] regional premier wealth platform targeting the mass affluent. we will target indonesia in our wealth management space. it will be a key market for us, given the sheer size of its population, he adds. we will also target the philippines. the literacy rate there is very high, so the scope for economic growth is tremendous. in the last 10 years, we have seen its gross domestic product grow north of 5% consistently. politically, it is a lot more stable than before. also, we will definitely target malaysia and singapore. maybank has the ability to collaborate across business sectors and borders. people are willing to share best practices and come together for the betterment of the group. cambodia, laos, myanmar and vietnam are not high on maybanks priority list as the level of affluence in these countries is not on a par with the rest of asean. despite being the fourth largest bank in the region in terms of assets, maybank is not one to rest on its laurels. since wealth management is about scale, lee says the group aims to gain critical mass. when you have enough customers and aum, you can support a bigger specialist and sales team, which is quite important for us. we want to be a fairly significant player within a short time frame. so, with maybanks rich client base, that will be easy to achieve over time. dbs bank ltd and ocbc bank of singapore are the largest wealth management players in asean. dbs aum stands at us$54 billion and will surpass us$88 billion with the acquisition of societe generals asian operations. ocbc currently has us$46 billion under management. comparatively, maybanks private wealth arm, launched 1u00bd years ago, has us$4.2 billion under management. the group, however, is not underestimating the competition from outside the banking arena. it is not just banks we are competing with, but also non-banks, like family offices, independent financial advisers and even internet companies, such as alibaba, have started providing money-management services that are traditionally offered by banks under the supervision of central banks, says lee. it is going to be a challenging landscape as it becomes more crowded. the bank that can bring sustained values to clients will survive longer.\n  this article first appeared in personal wealth, a section of the edge malaysia, on march 30 - april 5, 2015.

results announcement, ofi recorded a small revenue growth of 3% to rm63.3 million from rm61.4 million for the preceding quarter in the same period. the higher revenue was attributed to firmer demand from customers in the snack food and confectionery segment. correspondingly, profit before tax for 3qfy15 was higher from the improved revenue and also from foreign exchange gains as well as lower administration and finance costs in the current quarter. the board of ofi expects the performance of the group to be satisfactory for 4qfy15. a check of bloomberg consensus reveals that no research house covers the stock. this stock currently trades at a historical price-earning ratio of 17.1 times while its price-to-book value of 1.94 times indicates that its share price is trading at a premium to its book value. ofis chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frame is very firmly up. its share price made a good surge since its major weekly wave-2 low of rm1.05 in september 2011. since that rm1.05 low, ofi surged to its april 2015 recent all-time high of rm4.99. as prices broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of rm4.31 and rm4.38, look to buy ofi on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term uptrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, stochastic and oscillator) have issued buy signals and now depict very firm indications of ofis eventual surge towards much higher levels. it would attract firm buying activities at the support levels of rm4.31, rm4.38 and rm4.98. we expect ofi to witness some profit-taking at its resistance area and all-time high of rm4.99. its upside targets are located at rm5.91, rm6.55, rm9.15 and rm9.88. lee cheng hooi is the

garvin jabusch, co-founder and chief investment officer at green alpha advisors, certainly believes so. we have every opportunity to obtain competitive returns from investing in green assets. the most important innovations in the world have made the economy more efficient. this means more economic output. this generates wealth, he says. companies at the forefront of innovation will be the most sustainable and profitable in the long run, adds jabusch, who manages us$37 million at the denver-based asset management firm in the us.\nwhat green means there are a number ways to define a green stock. in the sustainable investment space, terms such as environmental, social and corporate governance (esg), socially responsible investing (sri), and green investing are often used interchangeably. this makes the evaluation of sustainable investments highly subjective, and thus unreliable for comparison. even within the different funds, investments are made based on varying criteria, according to jabusch. what you have here is quite an array of definitions. there are no two [asset management] institutions that view this in the exact same way. so, it is up to the individual manager running the mutual fund or portfolio to define what green means for themselves and their clients, he says. to provide greater clarity, green alpha advisors created the green alpha next economy index (nextx), which tracks the performance of companies in what it calls the next economy  companies that are green, self-sustaining, eco-efficient and fossil fuel-free. the nextx benchmarks itself against the s&p 500 and the powershares wilderhill clean energy index, and has returned 99.36% compared with the s&p 500s 163.1% and the powershares wilderhill clean energy indexs -30.35% between december 2008 and december 2014. tesla motors inc, sunedison inc, american water works company inc and applied materials inc are among the constituents of nextx. investors themselves may have their own definitions or requirements from the type of green investments they buy into. datuk shireen muhiudeen, managing director and principal fund manager at corston-smith asset management sdn bhd, says what clients ask for in their investment mandates can vary. for example, you can have clients who say they dont want to buy anything that deals with nuclear power, but they are okay with fishing companies that use trawl nets to catch fish. it is up to the client to decide its threshold of what green is and is not, she says, adding that this requires the client to do his or her own homework. they first have to look into the earnings contribution of a company and see what proportion of its revenue is from green sources. then, they have to decide whether this is acceptable, says shireen, whose firm manages private investment mandates for institutional clients. for jabusch, his definition of what is green is pretty straightforward. when you look at the environmental, social and governance definition, we are more focused on the e part rather than the s and g, he says. we try to assemble a portfolio of companies that operate in businesses we hope can contribute to an economy that is indefinitely sustainable, or can go on for a long time without running into systemic risks that could undermine our environment over the long run.  this article first appeared inpersonal wealth, a section ofthe edge malaysia, on march 23 - 29, 2015.

excited about it as the higher yield was a result of a slide in its share price over the last year.  from a high of rm2 per share on april 15, 2014, the share price has dropped to rm1.45 last wednesday. the decline in share price comes on the back of deteriorating earnings as the fashion retail company battles stiff competition while consumer sentiment remains weak. it is worth noting that padini (fundamental: 2.50; valuation: 0.90) has reported four consecutive quarters of earnings contraction since its third quarter ended march 31, 2014. however, despite lower earnings, it continued

post-gst, indicating that it will be absorbing the tax for those goods.  for merchandise offered for the first time after april 1, prices will be tweaked, where needed, so that we get to maintain our usual margins. but, we really do not know what the situation will be as a lot depends on how consumers react to the gst. it is very much a wait-and-see situation, and strategies will have to focus on the best way to react to the changed condition, the company says. for the second quarter ended dec 31, 2014, padini saw its net profit decline 43% year on year to rm16.21 million. this came about despite a 5% growth in revenue. gross profit margins fell 6% y-o-y due to heavy promotional and sales activities to clear inventory before the implementation of the gst. analysts expect padinis dividend payouts to remain intact despite the anticipated margin compression going forward. the free cashflow generation of the company is high, so i believe the yield is sustainable. we have reduced the earnings forecast to 10 sen per share. even at that level, we expect the dividend yield to be more than 5%, says alliancedbs research analyst cheah king yoong.  the companys balance sheet looks strong. as at dec 31, 2014, it had a net cash balance of rm121.64 million, or 18.5 sen per share, after deducting borrowings. its retained earnings stood at rm321.65 million. this indicates that the company can afford to make a bonus issue. at present, the companys share base is at 657.9 million, with par value of 10 sen.  when asked if padini has any additional goodies in store for its shareholders, it says, based on what has transpired thus far, the company does not have any plans for bumper dividends or bonus issues. midf research points out that the payout ratio and absolute dividend paid have increased from year to year at two sen per annum since fy2012. we believe management will strive to continue paying dividends. while padini is in the midst of expanding its distribution network  which dilutes profit margins  the company commands strong free cashflow generation and thus, we believe dividend payouts can be sustained, says the research house. padini plans to add six padini concept stores and six brands outlet stores in fy2015. as for fy2016, the company says it is expecting an additional four padini concept stores and five brands outlet stores. nonetheless, it says the opening of these stores will depend on the completion of new malls.  as intense competition and weak consumer sentiment continue to be a drag on earnings, analysts opine that brands outlet, its value-for-money brand, will be the growth engine for padini going forward. based on its segmental information, brands outlet stores contributed close to half of the companys profit in 1hfy2015.  we are still positive on padinis brands outlet stores as they appeal to the mass market and could provide some resilience to earnings in times of slower or more selective consumer spending. brands outlets same store sales growth was 16% in fy2014 and 8% in 1qfy2015, maybank investment research says in a report. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys

performances in the fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2014. the countrys second largest banking group saw its net profit plunge 81% year on year to rm200.3 million, largely due to higher corporate banking loan impairments in indonesia and malaysia. allowance for impairment losses on loans, advances and financing almost tripled to rm919.2 million from rm308.5 million a year ago. revenue dropped marginally by 3% y-o-y to rm3.67 billion while net return on equity (roe) stood at 0.64%. from an roe perspective, it was the worst quarter for cimb (fundamental: 1.35; valuation: 2.1), its newly confirmed group chief executive tengku datuk zafrul aziz acknowledged at the results briefing for reporters late last friday. for the full year, cimbs net profit slumped 31.6% to rm3.1 billion from rm4.54 billion a year earlier. allowance for impairment losses on loans, advances and financing jumped to rm1.52 billion from rm660.6 million a year ago. the groups annualised fy2014 roe was 9.2%  a stark contrast to the 15.5% achieved a year earlier  while its cost-to-income ratio increased to 59.1% from 58.2% before. cimb proposed a dividend of five sen per share for the quarter versus 11 sen in the same quarter a year earlier. zafrul said the group is targeting for roe to improve to 11% this year and for its cost-to-income ratio to come down to 55%. asked whether the heavy provisioning will continue, he said: there will be some for 1q2015 but it wont be as bad as for 4qfy2014. zafrul, who expects asset quality to normalise after the first quarter of this year, described fy2014 as a difficult year for the group with profitability impacted by slower revenue and a sharp increase in provisions. this was partially exacerbated by the weakened rupiah. capital markets continued to be challenged by low volumes and volatility, which affected the investment banking and treasury market operations. however, we remain heartened by the positive performances of the malaysian consumer bank and cimb bank singapore while cimb thai is showing operational traction, he added. zafrul also shared at the press briefing that cimb cut 150 jobs due to the closure of its australia and north asian business. this represents a single-digit percentage cut of its investment banking workforce. when asked if there were more job cuts in the pipeline, he said it would depend on the review done based on the groups new t18 strategic mid-term plan. zafrul said wholesale banking would still remain the groups focus, albeit to a lesser extent, given that margins in the segment have become compressed. he added that by 2018, cimb wants the consumer banking segment to contribute 60% to the groups income. in fy2014, this segment contributed 52.8% to the groups profit before tax while wholesale banking contributed 34.6%. the remaining 12.7% came from investments. on feb 6, cimb outlined its new t18 plan and key organisational changes with a mid-term target of achieving an roe of 15%, common equity tier 1 ratio of over 11%, cost-to-income ratio of below 50% and 60% consumer banking income contribution by end-2018. with the lower 4qfy2014 earnings, cimb has seen y-o-y earnings drop for the last seven quarters since the quarter ended june 30, 2013. the expectation is that its financial results will continue to be weak until at least the quarter ending march 31, 2015. a major contributing factor to cimbs disappointing earnings is its exposure to the indonesian market through pt bank cimb niaga. in 2014, cimb niaga saw its net profit fall 45.3% y-o-y to idr2.3 trillion on the back of provisions rising sharply by 188% y-o-y to idr3.5 trillion. its consolidated gross non-performing loan (npl) ratio had surged to 3.9% by the end of last year from 2.23% in 2013. zafrul believes indonesia will turn around. loan growth there is still strong u2026 in the high teens, he pointed out. banking analysts were not surprised by the results as cimbs management had already guided that the group would unveil a weak quarter. earnings were dented by the lacklustre capital market performance and higher provisions. moving forward, i think they will see cautious growth. one of the key things for them to get back on their feet is how good their cost initiatives are and how well they can execute their plans, says a local banking analyst.  another analyst opines that it was good for the group to conduct a kitchen-sinking exercise last year, referring to the sharp provisioning. lower the base and keep some buffer for 2015, he remarks. despite cimbs bad set of numbers, bharat joshi, head of investments at pt aberdeen asset management, says there were pockets of positivity. if you look at the consumer business of cimb, it maintained its momentum quietly. stripping out the rest of the business, the malaysian consumer business held up pretty well while the singapore consumer business did a lot better in 2014. the consolidated results were hampered by the wholesale business, which is the treasury market, corporate banking and investment banking, he tells the edge. the only surprising bit has been the steep increase in provisioning. hopefully, management can get a handle on asset quality going forward. all eyes will be on how they rein in asset quality. the saving grace, going into 2015, is the banks strong capital position. it is a lot stronger. this should help the banking group beat off some headwinds and concentrate on the actual work of cost-cutting and restructuring the business. as at dec 31, 2014, cimbs cet1 ratio stood at 10.1%, improving from 8% a year ago. meanwhile, both malayan banking bhd and rhb capital bhd, which also released their results last week, saw earnings climb in fy2014 in contrast to cimb. maybank saw its net profit rise marginally by 3% y-o-y to rm6.72 billion while rhbcaps full-year net profit jumped 11.5% to rm2.04 billion. maybanks roe for fy2014 was 13.6% while rhbcaps was 11.5%. note: the edge researchs

potential uptrend in our daily report on jan 28 when we noticed that the stock had been trading higher backed by strong momentum technical indicators. looking at the most recent first quarter of financial year 2015 (1qfy15) results announcement, the group recorded an improved profitability relative to 1qfy14. prolexus higher revenue in 1qfy15 was attributed to the increased revenue in the apparel and advertising divisions. correspondingly, profit before tax was also higher in 1qfy15 from the better revenue recorded. further to the announcement, the company expects performance to remain stable in the forthcoming quarter. a check of bloomberg consensus reveals that no research house covers the stock. prolexus currently trades at a cheap historical price-earnings ratio of 9.32 times. its price-to-book value ratio of 2.2 times indicates that its share price is trading at a steep premium to its book value. prolexus chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly up. its share price has made a good surge since its major weekly wave-2 low of seven sen in november 2010. since that seven sen low, prolexus has surged to its march 2015 recent all-time high of rm1.99. as prices broke below their recent key critical resistance levels of rm1.58 and rm1.74, look to buy prolexus on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short-

redberry media group, the media business unit of agricultural chemicals producer ancom bhd (fundamental: 0.55; valuation: 1.20), is in talks to sell its airport advertising business at around rm100 million. potential buyers, say industry sources, include media prima bhd (fundamental: 1.80; valuation: 1.20), whose subsidiary big tree is the biggest outdoor advertising company in the country and will be keen to extend its reach into airports. another party will be star publications (m) bhd (fundamental: 2.70; valuation: 1.20), which wants to diversify its revenue stream from mainly the print segment. redberry, which is also involved in the outdoor/billboard and in-store advertising business, conducts its airport advertising operation via meru utama sdn bhd. redberry and star have been in [informal] talks, says a source. according to the financial report for its nine months ended sept 30, 2014, star was sitting pretty on rm354.3 million net cash. the group does have money to buy assets but the acquisitions have to make sense and be a good fit for it. diversification is key to it and it also seems keen on digital assets, says a local media analyst. should redberry sell meru utama, its planned listing will not take place this year as the bulk of the formers revenue and profit is from the 75%-owned unit. according to its audited accounts for fy2013 ended may 31, meru utama registered a net profit of rm5.68 million  slightly lower than its rm5.87 million earnings a year earlier. a price tag of rm100 million values meru utama at a price-earnings ratio of nearly 20 times. on its website, it says it has been a strategic business partner of malaysia airports holdings bhd (mahb) in promoting and developing advertising at airports for the past 29 years. the edge, quoting sources, wrote in november last year that redberry was eyeing the listing of its media business on the local bourse as early as this year. it said what could be included in the listing were media properties under ancoms wholly-owned subsidiary redberry sdn bhd and the privately held the malay mail group. the malay mail group or its operating entity malay mail sdn bhd is currently not a part of ancom. its connection to the group is through ancom group managing director datuk siew kah wei and non-executive, non-independent director tan sri al amin abdul majid. both have a stake in malay mail through their respective 50% equity interest in dahlia megah sdn bhd, which, in turn, has a 46.79% stake in malay mail. in a reply to a bursa query on the edges november story, ancom says it is constantly on the lookout for opportunities to expand the groups media business locally and regionally through mergers and acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures and business collaborations, with the ultimate objective of listing redberry. why would star be interested? it is no secret that the print industry has been disrupted by digital technology and media players like star that are traditionally strong in print are racing against the clock to diversify to strengthen their position. according to the latest data by the audit bureau of circulations malaysia, total newspaper circulation volume in 1h2014 fell 10.9% year on year in the english and vernacular segments. in the english segment, circulation dropped 9.7% y-o-y to 767,891 copies from january to june 2014. cimb research, in a jan 26 note, says the drop can be attributed to a normalising effect following the general election in 2013, a structural shift towards the digital platform and a persistent weakness in consumer sentiment. despite the ongoing decline in print circulation, star managed to buck the trend and recorded 0.6% and 0.3% y-o-y growth for the star and sunday star respectively. we believe this is mainly due to its strong position as the market leader in the english segment and higher share of adex. star also continues to dominate the digital paper segment with a strong leading position of over 80,000 daily circulation compared with 3,000 for the new straits times press, it says.overall, we expect the declining trend in print circulation to continue due to rising consumer exposure to online and digital platforms. star has been aggressively diversifying into the digital space. in 2012, it launched star epaper. the group notes that circulation for its digital edition saw a 535% jump to 49,006 copies for the six months ended june 30, 2013, from a year earlier. then in 2013, it expanded its digital footprint through the acquisition of ocision sdn bhd, which owned three internet portals  ibilik.com, propwall.com and carsifu.com. in 9mfy2014, star saw its net profit decline 8.8% to rm89.93 million due to higher operating expenses related mainly to a vss amounting to rm11.5 million. revenue for the period declined 0.4% to rm732.85 million. maybank investment research says it expects stars 4qfy2014 core net profit to be flattish at about rm35 million quarter on quarter. this will bring 4qfy2014 core net profit down between 20% and 25% y-o-y. for the whole of 2014, we expect core net profit to come within expectations at about rm135 million or down between 5% and 6% y-o-y, it notes. it adds that while it does not expect organic earnings growth to be exciting in the near future, it still likes star for its cost-saving initiatives and operational turnaround. its

management changes. management has disclosed its ambitious t18 strategy, but we need to see strong execution. for example, it closed its australian business, which demonstrates that it is willing to take some heavy cuts to restore investor confidence. but what would reaffirm conviction for the stock is for the bank to stop acquiring more assets, and consolidating whatever it has in its balance sheet. the healing process will definitely take time, says bharat joshi, head of investments at pt aberdeen asset management, tells the edge in a telephone interview from jakarta. the franchise is certainly cheap at this level, but it still needs to trim a lot of the fat accumulated over the past decade. the consumer bank engine needs to be reignited while tightening up the cimb niaga business because its starting to become the achilles heel for the bank. the non-performing loans (npls) are coming back to bite them. cimb niagas net profit for its financial year ended dec 31, 2014, fell

in 2013. we are still holding on to cimb shares but wont be adding more until we see actual results. we are in it for the long term, but we want to see its execution ability before we start turning optimistic again, says bharat. banking analysts share his views. the stock has come a long way u2026 but there will still be bad news to come. there will be fourth-quarter results that are expected to be very weak, says a senior banking analyst. moreover, a lot of people are still wondering if it can successfully execute what it plans to do. so far, they have missed their targets. most investors will want to wait to see how the restructuring and cost-cutting pan out first. also, cimbs regional side needs to be cleaned up. the asset quality problems in indonesia are not that great. investors should get a better sense of the amount of provisions they have to make and when the npls will peak in indonesia before buying into the regional exposure. six analysts polled by bloomberg have a buy call on the stock, while another six have a sell call. a majority of the analysts polled  14  have a hold recommendation. the 12-month consensus target price for cimb is rm6.02. another banking analyst reckons that investors who are patient and willing to ride out the near-term headwinds that cimb will be facing could consider picking the stock should it continue to trade at the current low levels. it also depends on the investors risk appetite, he says. uob kay hian research says it believes that the rm5.20 level (1.1 times its forecast fy2015 book value) represents a more attractive entry point as the current 1.2 times p/b may not have fully priced in two quarters (4qfy2014 and 1qfy2015) of weak results, which could drag the groups return on equity (roe) to 10% versus the current 11.5% expectation. with cimb expected to report further weakness in 4qfy2014 and 1qfy2015 earnings, coupled with a rather subdued growth outlook guidance for 2015, we see downside risk in earnings expectations and hence, roe as well. note that 3qfy2014 roe of 9.8% was significantly lower than managements initial 2014 target of 13.5%, it adds. the foreign research house has a hold call on the stock and a target price of rm6 (1.3 times 2015f p/b and 11.3% roe). banking on alternatives if one falls into the category of wait-and-see investors and does not want to buy into cimb just yet, what are the alternatives out there? public bank bhd (fundamental: 2.8; valuation: 1.0) has always been a favourite in the finance sector given its earnings track record, but it does not come cheap, trading at a high premium of 2.55 times p/b  the highest in the sector. as most banks are battling in a tougher operating landscape, the third largest banking group in the country recently announced another strong set of results. for its fy2014 ended dec 31, 2014, public bank posted an 11.17% increase in net profit to rm4.52 billion compared with a year ago. commenting on the fy2014 financial results over a week ago, founder and chairman tan sri teh hong piow said the group persevered and continued to perform well, recording a strong annual loan growth of 10.8%, outpacing the banking systems 8.7%. public bank is expensive. but if investors are willing to pay the premium for its earnings predictability, it is a good choice, says another banking analyst. but there are others like hong leong bank bhd (fundamental: 2.8; valuation: 2.2) and rhb capital bhd (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 2.1) which may provide a cheaper entry [into the sector] and still bring steady earnings. but bear in mind that they will not be able to give them the regional reach that cimb can. rhb capital is trading at 1.14 times p/b and hong leong, 1.7 times. the two domestic banks  hong leong bank and public bank  which didnt jump on the regional acquisition bandwagon have remained quite sturdy. i wouldnt say going regional is a bad thing, but one always has to be careful, especially in newer markets where one lacks local knowledge or experience. there has to be a gradual and sustainable expansion strategy in any market one goes into, says bharat. industry observers also point out that malayan banking bhd (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 1.3) will be able to provide the regional reach investors are looking for. it is trading at 1.68 times p/b. maybank is an option, but it is comparatively not as cheap as cimb now. i guess there is a price for everything, says a local banking analyst with a bank-backed research house.   note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a

to remain resilient", "article": " the latest results season (for the quarter ended dec 31, 2014) is expected to give investors some indication of how resilient the earnings of oil and gas companies are. the share prices of some of these companies have rebounded after the heavy selldown last year. a favourable catalyst for the sectors fundamentals, as well as on investor sentiment, is the recent rebound in the brent crude oil price. after bottoming out at us$46.59 per barrel on jan 13, it shot up to us$58.25 as at feb 6, or a gain of 25%. after the nerve-racking plunge of oil and gas stocks, some analysts and fund managers have regained some confidence in the sector. the current share prices, they believe, have factored in all the bad news. the more optimistic among them say another rally could be on the way. experts say that while there are still key concerns about an oversupply of crude oil, companies should remain resilient, particularly those with minimal exposure to fluctuations in the price of the commodity. the crucial question is whether local oil and gas players will be able to maintain their earnings in the face of headwinds. we will definitely start to see the impact (of falling oil prices) in the fourth quarter (ended dec 31, 2014) for some companies. those in production-related activities will be less impacted currently but the ones that are involved in drilling and exploration will definitely be hit, says a senior executive of a major oil and gas services provider. in a recent note, macquarie research projects a significant expansion in the valuations of malaysian oil and gas stocks under its coverage, following a largely disappointing 2014. while there was a downgrade in earnings per share, partly due to the falling oil price, the research outfit says it expects the trend to reverse this year as earnings growth should occur in tandem with a possible crude oil price recovery. maybank ib research has reiterated its buy calls for 9 out of 13 oil and gas stocks under its coverage, projecting a sector earnings multiple average of a reasonable 12.9 times. its 12-month price targets for the stocks imply an upside potential of up to 70% from present prices. credit suisse managing director and co-head of oil and gas research david hewitt believes that there are concrete reasons to remain bullish on the crude oil price trajectory. bear in mind that there are many upstream operators whose earnings are minimally exposed to the oil price volatility. in the previous two downcycles, the crude oil price doubled from its trough within 12 months, so there is a huge upside in the fundamentals. shares of oil services companies have fallen the most as they were highly exposed to crude oil prices, in addition to petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) cutting its capex by between 15% and 20% this year. for example, operators such as perisai petroleum teknologi bhd (jackup rigs), malaysia marine and heavy engineering holdings bhd (offshore construction and marine repairs) and alam maritim resources bhd (offshore support vessels) have seen their shares decline by more than 60% since june. over the past six months, these companies reported much lower earnings, suggesting that the share price decline was partly justified by the worsening fundamentals. on the other hand, companies with stronger balance sheets and large order books have much better prospects. in a recent sector note, credit suisse says it favours quality stocks with attractive valuations and those that are relatively unimpacted by oil price volatility, highlighting sapurakencana petroleum bhd and dialog group bhd in particular. it says that for sapurakencana, only about 10% of its business is directly exposed to the oil price. its price-to-book of 1.51 times is also at a historic trough, suggesting that its stock price has tremendous upside potential. an oil and gas analyst says companies such as dialog and muhibbah engineering (m) bhd present minimal downside risks thanks to their large order books and long-term commitment to petronas rapid project. for the sector, we expect to see some resilience, which translates into an incremental increase in earnings for now. while a pickup in upstream activity would certainly help, we prefer stocks which are more reliant towards long-term contracts and steady revenue expectations, he says. companies who are carrying out risk service contracts (rsc) with petronas, such as uzma bhd and petra energy bhd, look set to maintain their impressive earnings growth. this is because they will continue to recognise profits based on performance. conversely, petronas owns all of the oil extracted and is the one exposed to crude oil price volatility. this is evident from the earnings performance of the two. for the quarter ended sept 30, 2014, both dialog and uzma reported a stronger quarter-on-quarter net profit growth in spite of the bearishness in the sector, which began in june as crude oil dipped below us$100 per barrel. in a feb 5 note, uob kay hian research states that this may already be happening. we have turned neutral (from underweight) on the oil and gas sector following the share price recovery, noting that most oil and gas stocks under our coverage have rebounded by 20% to 40% from recent lows, it says.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia

reach over 4 percentage points or at least 400 basis points higher than it is currently. \"unless and until that is settled, the mother of volatility in global equity market will persist,\" the firm

the foreseeable future, more pressingly once the us is certain on its next policy tightening, it noted. the consolation for the local equity market is that foreign investors have returned, it said. their reappearance is driven by the attractiveness of a cheaper ringgit, which is undervalued by about 5%-10%, and the less demanding risk premium of only 3.2% locally, vis-a-vis regionally, it added. indeed, with the risk premium being the third lowest in the region now, it believes the local market will be thriving again. however, it sees investors as being picky in their stock selection. \"only

" airasia bhd and its loss-making associate airasia x bhd are consolidating their operations, where possible, in a major exercise to cut cost and improve efficiencies, sources say. the move will also see the groups founder, tan sri tony fernandes, play a more prominent role in the management of airasia x. this has prompted intense speculation that airasia x ceo azran osman-rani may leave the long-haul budget carrier he has helmed since july 2007. but azran, when contacted, denies this. the consolidation exercise began about two months ago and is expected to bring about 30% overall savings  for example, in terms of fuel cost  across the group by the second quarter of next year. wherever the two companies can consolidate their departments, they will. they will ride on each others strengths rather than waste cost and talent through duplication. the ultimate aim is to try and have much leaner operations, a source familiar with the plan tells the edge. it is a practical move, the source adds, pointing to some cases where there are two heads  one from each company  running similar operations at the same airport. the engineering, commercial and ancillary departments are among those that will be merged. where the two can co-exist, they should. they can benefit from economies of scale. however, there are no lay-offs planned as the group is expanding, the source explains. airasia group ceo fernandes, when contacted, confirms that the two companies are in the midst of a consolidation exercise and that hes playing a more prominent role in airasia x. he, however, does not elaborate. yes, im effectively running airasia x with the management. the consolidation is all about cutting cost, which benefits both companies, he says. on speculation that the exercise will lead to the two companies being merged, resulting in the delisting of airasia x, he replies, no way. he goes on to say that he expects airasia x to make excellent profits in 2015, without elaborating how, and that associate thai airasia x will also be profitable. the source says both companies will remain listed. at the end of the day, there is no change of shareholders in airasia and airasia x. given airasia xs dismal financial showing in recent quarters, it is no surprise that fernandes wants to have a bigger say in the running of its business, analysts say. a lot more decisions are being referred to him, a source says. thus, there has been intense speculation within the group that azran has been looking to leave airasia x, other sources say. when contacted, however, azran says: not true, im not leaving the company. airasia x recently reported a net loss of rm210.85 million for the third quarter ended sept 30, 2014 (3q2014)  its fourth consecutive quarterly loss and its worst showing since its listing in july 2013  as higher operating expenses, foreign exchange losses and finance costs nipped at margins. for the nine months to date, its net loss came in at rm350.91 million compared with a net profit of rm44.34 million in the same period a year ago. analysts say they expect airasia x to return to a potentially small profit next year, based on its latest plans to revive the business. these include tapering capacity growth, ramping up ancillary income, reducing capacity on its route network during lean months and redeploying the aircraft on wet-lease charters to third party airlines elsewhere in the world. the company has initiated some of the turnaround plans and is confident of turning itself around. the worst is over, the source tells the edge. the sharp fall in oil prices in recent months will certainly help airasia x reduce fuel costs, but analysts say the positive impact to its bottom line may be offset by other factors such as the depreciating ringgit as much of its cost is in us dollars. yield recovery may also not pick up in a strong way. rhb research institute aviation analyst ahmad maghfur usman says airasia xs deteriorating balance sheet raises concerns over how the carrier will go about funding its future aircraft acquisitions. on dec 15, airasia x placed a firm order from airbus for 55 a330neo aircraft, which are relatively more fuel efficient, for us$15.2 billion and targeted for delivery from 2018. this bumps up its total order from airbus to 91 aircraft. to reduce heavy upfront cash payment, it said it would use operating leases for all of its 2015 aircraft deliveries. the carrier is expected to see high depreciation and lease expenses squeezing potential profits, ahmad maghfur says in dec 16 report on the sector. bloomberg data shows that of at least 16 analysts that track the stock, most (or nine of them) have a sell call on it, with the 12-month target price at 66 sen a share. the stock has shed some 31% so far this year to 69 sen last tuesday. analysts, however, are more optimistic about airasias prospects, both from an earnings and stock perspective. airasia reported a smaller third quarter net profit (3q2014) of rm5.4 million compared with rm35.48 million in the same period a year ago, due to lower operating profit and higher finance cost. however, net profit for the nine months to date has more than doubled to rm512.27 million compared with rm198.62 million before. airasia will deliver solid earnings from 2q2015 onwards as the benefit of lower fuel price trickles in. the weaker ringgit against the us dollar will offset some of the benefit as 60% to 70% of its operating costs are denominated in usd. on a net basis, it is still favourable and we raise our fy2015 and fy2016 earnings by 24.4% and 11.2% respectively, says maybank investment bank research analyst mohshin aziz. most analysts have a buy call on the stock, with the 12-month target at rm3.23 a share, according to bloomberg data. the stock has gained some 34% this year to close at a year-to-date high of rm2.90 last tuesday. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on december 29, 2014 - january 04,

building society bhd (mbsb)  with combined assets of rm613.72 billion (as at march 31)  would make the merged entity the largest banking group by assets and one of the top five in asean. corporate malaysia started buzzing with news about the merger as early as july and in october, it was revealed that the proposed deal would see rhb capital acquire the assets and liabilities of cimb, contrary to popular belief that the bigger bank would be the acquiring party. the deal will be done via a share swap of one rhb cap share for 1.38 cimb shares. this is based on a benchmark price of rm7.27 per cimb share and rm10.03 per rhb cap share, which translates into a price-to-book value (p/bv) ratio of 1.7 times and 1.44 times for cimb and rhb cap respectively. also, cimbs islamic banking subsidiary will acquire all the assets and liabilities of mbsb for rm7.77 billion or rm2.82 per share at a p/bv of 1.32 times. mbsbs shareholders will have a choice of cash or new shares in the unlisted cimb islamic group. the edge financial daily had reported in august that the merger route being considered would see cimb selling its entire banking business to rhb cap in return for new shares. as the buyer of the assets and liabilities of another banking group, rhb cap only needs a 50%+1 share approval for the deal compared with the selling party that would need 75%. with such a structure, the merger looks like a done deal as one of its drivers  the employees provident fund (epf)  already holds a 41.5% stake in rhb cap. therein lies the debate  can and should the epf vote on the deal? apart from its 41.5% stake in rhb cap, the epf also owns 14.6% of cimb and 64.6% of mbsb. thus, there is likely to be a conflict of interest if the retirement fund is allowed to vote. on oct 22, bursa malaysia  which decides whether or not majority shareholders can vote on a deal  barred the epf from voting on the merger. the latters appeal against the decision was rejected on dec 10.  should the epf sit out the vote, rhb caps middle-eastern investor, aabar investments pjs, holds the trump card. given its 21.2% stake in rhb cap, it could stymie the deal. and with 9.9% equity interest in rhb cap, osk holdings bhds vote is also important. while the mega-merger is nowhere near completion, much has happened since it was announced in july. we review here its key players. - by joyce goh  datuk seri nazir razakchairman, cimb group holdings bhd nazir, who is synonymous with cimb, stepped down as its ceo in september. he handed over the reins to tengku datuk zafrul tengku abdul aziz and took over from tan sri md nor md yusof as chairman of the company. his retirement comes at a crucial time for the group, which is in the middle of a mega-merger. however, nazir is still very much involved in the deal. in fact, industry players say he is one of its engineers. they say third time is lucky. im quite optimistic that we can pull together a successful merger proposal to be taken to all the shareholders for their consideration, he said in september. to recap, a merger and acquisition between cimb and rhb cap was initiated in 1998 and 2011, but both attempts failed. nazir also commented on the proposed mega-merger this month, signalling his confidence that it is more or less a done deal. we think we will get through it with or without the epf, he told reporters on dec 2.  datuk abdul farid aliasgroup president and ceo, malayan banking bhd maybank will lose its position as the countrys largest bank once the three-way merger between cimb, rhb cap and mbsb is completed. but farid has put on a brave face. we do not need to acquire another bank just to be the biggest. [with] the sizewe have now, we can be significant and relevant to provide allthat we promised our customers, he said in august. when news of the mega-merger broke, there was intense speculation that maybank would join the fray and make a bid for rhb cap. after all, the largest bank in the country had competed head-to-head with cimb for rhb cap in 2011. however, both banks decided to walk away from rhb cap at the time because aabar investments pjs acquired the stake from abu dhabi commercial bank (adcb) at rm10.80 per share or 2.25 times book value. on aug 2, 2013, farid replaced datuk seri abdul wahid omar, who had resigned in june to take over as minister in the prime ministers department in charge of the economic planning unit. prior to that, the harvard business school alumni was deputy president and head of maybanks global wholesale banking. farid has over two decades of banking and finance experience and also worked at jp morgan and schroders and was a director of investments at khazanah nasional bhd.  tan sri ong leong huatceo and group managing director, osk holdings bhd the 69-year-old self-made tycoon has been in the world of finance for over four decades now and has been involved in countless corporate deals. while he initiates and executes deals for his clients, ongs businesses have had their fair share of corporate exercises too. this year, the veteran banker made the headlines for two mega-mergers  one involving his interest in rhb cap and the other involving his property companies. just two years after ong sold his investment banking arm to rhb cap for rm2.09 billion (he was paid via a combination of cash and shares in the latter), he is back in the spotlight, thanks to the proposed merger between cimb, rhb cap and mbsb. with ong controlling osks 9.9% stake in rhb cap, he has a say in the mega-merger. following bursa malaysias decision to disallow the epf from voting on the merger, osk is the second-largest shareholder in rhb cap, after aabar, that will be voting on the merger. osk has yet to reveal its cards but its founder ong will be able to sniff out a lousy deal in a flash. while the banking and investment fraternity awaits the outcome of the mega-merger, ong is involved in a three-way merger between osk, osk property holdings bhd and pj development holdings bhd (pjd), which will create a first-tier property group.  jho lowceo, jynwel capital penangite low taek jho, better known as jho low, is still drawing attention despite spending less time in the country. this is because the 32-year-old continues to be involved in the local corporate world partly due to his strong middle-eastern connections. one of the more notable corporate deals which low was instrumental in facilitating was the entry of adcb into rhb capital bhd in 2008. at the time, adcb had paid rm7.20 per share for a 24.9% stake in rhb cap at a valuation of 2.2 times price to book. the stake was then sold to its sister company aabar investments for rm10.20 per share in 2012. with its current 21.2% interest in rhb cap, aabar has a say in the cimb-rhb cap-mbsb mega-merger. while low may not be directly involved in the deal, industry observers say he is very much behind the scenes, safeguarding the interests of his middle-eastern friends. the wharton alumni also made the headlines this year, thanks to his family investment vehicle jynwel capital. since 2012, jynwel has advised on investments of up to us$7 billion, say reports. this year alone, jynwel, together with abu dhabi government-linked funds, made an offer to adidas ag to buy the fitness brand reebok for u20ac1.7 billion, says the wall street journal. jynwel also made an offer to acquire london-listed salamander energy plc in october but recently decided not to pursue it . in 2009, low was involved in the setting-up of the terengganu investment authority, in which he served as an adviser. he left in mid-may 2009 and the prime minister

not give up easily. after bursa malaysia barred the retirement fund from voting on the proposed merger between cimb, rhb cap and mbsb on oct 22, it made a submission to the stock exchanges appeals committee on oct 31. it wants a chance to plead its case via an oral presentation.  shahril has publicly shared his belief that the epf, as the major shareholder of both rhb cap and cimb, has the right to vote on the merger of the two banking groups. in making the epfs case, he said the retirement fund had the interest of 14 million members to protect and that it only wanted to vote on the merger between rhb cap and cimb. it will sit out the exercise involving mbsb. the epf owns 14.6% of cimb, 41.5% of rhb cap and 64.6% of mbsb. the 44-year-old shahril took over as ceo of the epf from tan sri azlan zainol in 2013. before that, he was the epfs deputy ceo for investment. prior to joining the retirement fund in 2009, shahril was managing director of malaysian resources corp bhd.

5.0-6.0%. furthermore, the fbmklci is within the sideways trend support and resistance levels at 1,700 and 1,765 points. i believe that the market will remain uncertain if the index stays between

which will unlikely abate in the first quarter of 2015. maybank investment bank bhd, in a note, said it sees the overplayed pre-gst theme, developers turning cautious, rising pressure on margins post-gst, and waning price catalysts as factors that could limit upside for the property sector in 2015. however, it has maintained its buy rating on s p setia, with a target price (tp) of rm4.07. while there is still concern over s p setias management succession plan, downside risks to earnings and share price are limited,. catalysts include potential asset injection by its major shareholders, the note read. it was reported that s p setia was left with a vacuum in leadership after the departure of its former president and chief executive officer tan sri liew kee sin on april 30, 2014. s p

momentum indicators such as the rsi and momentum oscillator have rebounded to its middle levels. this is another indication of a possible reversal. furthermore, the fbm klci has climbed above the middle band of the bollinger bands indicator. therefore, the momentum indicators are also at a crossroads. the index is either going to climb higher and break above the immediate resistance level or the bears may take the opportunity of the current rebound to start selling again. we expect the index to test the immediate resistance level at 1,765 points this week. at the moment, it is still best to remain cautious and not to be too anxious about the current rebound. there is not much improvement on the market sentiment, unless the index can break and stay above the immediate resistance level. failure to break above this level would send the index back to test the immediate support level at 1,710 points. fundamentally, falling crude oil prices and a weakening ringgit may still weigh down

lumpur (jan 14): malaysias dream of forming an islamic megabank to accelerate industry development remains just that. a three-way merger that would have created a lender with the financial clout to win bigger sukuk deals against the likes of hsbc holdings plc and standard chartered plc has stalled as tumbling oil prices wreak havoc on the economy. the planned amalgamation of cimb group holdings bhd., rhb capital bhd. and malaysia building society bhd. would have been the nations largest ever m&a transaction. central bank governor zeti akhtar aziz first raised the idea of an islamic finance megabank more than five years ago to better compete for business in the persian gulf and cement malaysias position as a shariah-compliant hub. a license slated to be awarded in 2011 for a multinational lender to be formed between asia and the middle east didnt materialize, depriving the $1.7 trillion global industry of a growth engine. this is a dampener on the development of islamic finance and its reach into the global market, mohamed azahari kamil, chief executive officer at asian finance bank bhd. in kuala lumpur, said by phone yesterday. i dont think there will be another merger for a while as current market conditions arent conducive. cimbs board will meet today to discuss the merger, according to a stock exchange filing from the bank issued late yesterday. the parties are still in discussions, according to a rhb statement. regional integration while cimb has topped the sukuk underwriter rankings in malaysia for the past eight years, hsbc has held the title in the middle east since 2009. as the nations second-largest lender, cimb arranged a total of 18.3 billion ringgit ($5.1 billion) in deals in 2014 when overall sales reached 62 billion ringgit, data compiled by bloomberg show. europes biggest bank managed $2.5 billion, down from $5.5 billion in 2013 and $9 billion in 2012. the islamic development bank was seeking partners in 2012 to bring in $1 billion in investment to form a megabank. the financial institution, which was to be established with riyadh- based dallah albaraka group and the qatari government, planned to issue islamic bonds that lenders could buy to manage excess funds, jeddah, saudi arabia-based idb president ahmad mohamed ali said in a may interview that year. that plan also didnt come to fruition. the cimb-rhb merger, first announced in october, would have created a group with total assets of 637.9 billion ringgit, surpassing the 612 billion ringgit of the nations biggest lender malayan banking bhd., according to data compiled by bloomberg. the new entity would have become southeast asias fourth-largest bank, behind singapores dbs group holdings ltd., oversea-chinese banking corp. and united overseas bank ltd. success doubts terms for the deal no longer make sense as the industry outlook worsens, people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because deliberations are private, said yesterday. an official announcement could come as soon as this week, one person said. failure to create a mega shariah bank isnt a major setback for the islamic finance industry, according to investment advisory company prometheus capital finance ltd. whenever something like a megabank is forced into creation, im not so sure that itll be so successful, thomas christie, the head of fixed income at prometheus, said by phone from dubai yesterday. the main problem is more the integration between the gulf market and the more developed malaysian market. however, its not going to dissuade people from looking for other ways to integrate the two regions. malaysia is feeling the pinch from plunging oil prices that have sent the ringgit to its weakest level since 2009. a subsequent drop in revenue for asias only major oil exporter may make it more difficult for the government to achieve its target of cutting the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product this year from 3.5 percent. budget review a major support for the currency may also be removed should the current-account surplus slip into deficit. the excess was 7.6 billion ringgit in the third quarter, already the smallest since june 2013. brent crude has fallen 57 percent in six months to its lowest level since 2009. malaysia may review the 2015 budget to take into account the impact of the decline in oil, according to a report yesterday from state news agency bernama, citing prime minister najib razak. a statement is due next week, it said. the establishment of a megabank for the global islamic finance industry would help remove a major impediment to growth as investors say there arent enough products, particularly sukuk, to meet demand. ernst & young llp estimates shariah- compliant banking assets will double by 2018. shares rally stock market investors seem to have taken a positive view on the breakdown of the bank merger. cimb shares ended the day 14 percent higher, compared with a 0.8 percent gain in the benchmark ftse bursa malaysia klci index. rhb climbed 0.9 percent. malaysia building society lost 5.9 percent as it wont get access to a broader loans and mortgage market. the creation of a mega islamic bank isnt critical to malaysias islamic finance industry at the moment, even though the prospect is enticing, suhaimi zainul-abidin, treasurer of the gulf asia shariah compliant investments association, said in an e-mail from singapore yesterday. it should happen as a matter of course as the market matures, and it is important that the creation of such a megabank

yes, that is possible, but that depends on the regulator (bank negara malaysia). i think for foreign investors in banks, that is always their ultimate aim u2026 to increase their shareholding. australia-based anz, which emerged as a strategic partner in ammb back in may 2007, also has a 39% stake in indonesias pt bank pan indonesia tbk (bank panin), for which it has reportedly hired an investment bank to look for buyers. apart from that, anz has a 20% stake in shanghai rural commercial bank co ltd and 17.6% in bank of tianjin co ltd, among others. merger with maybank? azman says ammb is fully focused on trying to improve its performance and is stepping up efforts to gain market share in the competitive marketplace. the malaysia-focused group is not distracted by the recent merger developments in the industry, he insists. we are pushing forward on our strengths. we have spent a lot of effort and made substantial investments in impressing our capabilities [over the last two years] and are ready to go faster. but as the operating landscape gets tougher and with banks starting to consolidate to build size and venture into overseas markets, can ammb continue to go it alone or will it join the consolidation game? analysts say should azman and anz be looking to give up their stakes, top lender malayan banking bhd (maybank) is likely to be interested. apart from being seen as one of the better fits for ammb, maybank also has an additional reason to seek a merger  it will lose its long-held position as the countrys largest banking group by assets if the cimb-rhb-mbsb merger comes to fruition. maybank ceo datuk abdul farid alias has nevertheless said it will not acquire another bank just to maintain its top spot, pointing out that any acquisition must enhance its shareholder value. azman, when asked what he thinks about a potential maybank-ammb pairing, says: at the moment, no thoughts about that. he laughs good-naturedly when it is suggested that it would be a homecoming of sorts for him if there were to be such a merger, given that it was in maybank that he had his start in banking (see side story). maybank ran into some turbulence in the late 1960s and bank negara put azman, a chartered accountant, there as a non-executive director for about five years to help sort out its problems. he was eventually made an executive director in 1971. i was there 10 years, from 1971 to 1980. that was during the most formative years. it was the first local bank to introduce computer systems u2026 it was a big deal, you know (laughs). i was the one who initiated the competition for the design of the head office building. many branches opened. we started the merchant bank  aseambankers, in those days, we started the insurance company, credit cards. so interesting. the growth was fantastic. i really enjoyed it. it gave me the exposure, experience and confidence to run my own bank [later], he recalls. for sentimental reasons, would he be keen on a maybank-ammb merger? at the moment, im just looking at making the bank [ammb] perform better, he answers. driving force azman founded arab-malaysian merchant bank bhd in 1976. he then built it into what is now known as ambank group. he has been the driving force behind the groups successes over the years. its 38-year journey, however, was not without headwinds. azman recalls the lowest point in his career, when the banking group was nearly swallowed up by the affin group due to the governments move to consolidate banks during the 1997/98 financial crisis. the bank was hit. this was because two years before that, we finally got the last part [that we needed to become a] financial supermarket  we bought a commercial bank, at market price as per all our acquisitions. after we bought it, we had to make sure we were making money out of it u2026 so we dished out loans, mostly corporate loans. [and the] worst-hit sector during the crisis was corporate loans. that was the worst time. the banks share price nosedived to about rm1 from between rm24 and rm26 a share. azman was hit not just as a banker but also as an entrepreneur and borrower. imagine what happened to me. all my assets went out the window. all the banks were very hard. some foreign banks were hard and rude u2026 the way they treated people was very bad. so, i can understand how borrowers feel when they are hard-pressed. and of course u2026 the part that was really bad was when under the banks consolidation, we were supposed to be swallowed up by affin bank. just imagine, ambank would have disappeared! but we made a turnaround immediately u2026 so quick u2026 in one year! he says. the group fell into the red, incurring a net loss of rm426.6 million for its financial year ended march 31, 1999. it returned to the black just a year after that, registering a net profit of rm209.3 million in fy2000. it then continued making profits every year except for fy2007 when it incurred a net loss of rm282.5 million due to a significant one-off prudent provisioning charge it made to build up its loan loss coverage for long outstanding non-performing loans. following its escape from being eaten by affin bank in 1997/98, it began strengthening itself to become a solid independent banking player. in 2012, ammb acquired kurnia insurans (m) bhd and mbf cards (m) sdn bhd to support the growth of its non-interest income. today, the group, which once focused mainly on auto financing and investment banking, has evolved into a more diversified universal banking group, with bottom lines crossing the billion-ringgit mark. the entry of anz in 2007 helped boost the groups product base, strengthened its business policies and improved its asset quality. ammbs group managing director, ashok ramamurthy from anz, took over the reins from veteran banker cheah tek kuang in 2012. azman says the group will continue to stay focused on the local market despite its rivals going increasingly regional. thats partly because of the partnership with anz [which already has a regional presence through its stakes in asian lenders]. but there is nothing to stop us from going overseas, for example, in islamic banking and investment banking. the big question is, will azman still be with the group when it ventures into its next stage of growth?  below are excerpts from the interview: the edge: what is your view of the cimb-rhb-mbsb merger that is in the works?tan sri azman hashim: i think its good. if you want to be going regional and have the power and size to be going regional, then you have to have this kind of merger. its good. people have different views on whether the epf should be allowed to have a vote on the merger. your view?\npersonally, i feel the epf should be allowed to vote. the epf is the biggest investor on the stock market and is a substantial shareholder in most of the companies. so, denying it the vote seems unfair. the epf should have the ability to protect its investments. what are your thoughts about the current banking consolidation and in your opinion, how different is it from the previous round?\npreviously, there were 30 over banks. and then consolidation came in 1998/99 and we were supposed to be swallowed by affin bank. i dont understand why. but anyway, thank god and tun mahathir  from an intended six anchor banks it became 10. so, we remained part of the 10. that was the first consolidation exercise. now, we have eight banks, and with this current merger, itll be even less. but let me say this. from the customers point of view, my own experience is that they prefer to have choices. in fact, with too few banks, youll have a problem because for customers, for the businessmen, they have less banks to approach. so, i think, we need to have medium-sized banks also, like us (ambank). you know, during the asian financial crisis of 1997/98, i was much affected personally not just at the bank but more as an entrepreneur and borrower. then, you could see how the banks worked. its the foreign banks  some were terrible. i had experience with two. i was looked down upon and treated rudely. during a crisis like that, their head office just said, cut credit to this and that sector, and it was done ... theres no sentiment and no matter what youre doing to improve, they cut. we are a malaysian bank, and we try to understand the people and circumstances. because i was personally affected, i understood completely what was happening and the situation. many of the reasons for the crisis were beyond our control, caused by foreigners attacking our currency and the stock market. so, we accommodated many of the malaysian companies. you need to have domestic banks, and not too few, because especially in times of crisis, the borrower needs to be able to go to the bank, talk to them face-to-face  this is what we did for others. and many are thankful to us because we took them up during the crisis. so, im not so sure we should have, for example, just three or four large banks. i think theres room for a few of the not-too-bigs. you get too big also, you can get very impersonal ... like international banks. then it becomes difficult to maintain the personal touch, which is important to me. so, in malaysia, there is space for banks like us. down the line, could there be a potential partnership for ambank with another bank?\ni think we have to keep an open mind. i would say id keep an open mind, because the situation changes. well see how it is. in the end, what is good for the bank is what counts. also, the mega merger is not completed. integration is not an easy thing, you know. we also had some exercises integrating with mbf finance, with kurnia insurans. its a big exercise, and we take two to three years at least to settle down, so we have to see what comes up with it. so, the environment might change, the situation might change. in fact, when integration takes place, usually the banks are so involved in it that its difficult for them to really be aggressive in the marketplace. theyre so busy trying to integrate their systems, their people ... we know about the problem. so, this is the time for us to improve our performance and get more market share. with the three banks now busy with the mega merger, is ambank stepping up its efforts to gain market share?\nthat is a normal process. in other words, all the banks do that all the time anyway. but maybe with the integration process going on, were still doing the same thing, but therell be a bit less competition perhaps ...

report today that the improvement was not as strong as expected, judging from the number of results that missed estimates as well as some banks guiding down further 2014 roe targets. the research house is maintaining its neutral rating on the sector with ammb as its sole buy recommendation. four out of the six banking stocks that we cover reported results that were in line with both our and

banking loans growth. wee said, we believe the sector as a whole lacks compelling catalysts with moderating loans growth rising loans-to-deposit ratio (ldr) will continue to weigh down on nim from a funding cost angle, and upward reversal in provisions from a historical low which comes on the back of npl stresses in certain loan segments. uobkayhian is maintaining its market weight rating with maybank as its top pick. it has maintained sell calls on cimb and rhb cap given the risk of further earnings disappointment and cimbs impending roe-dilutive merger. he reasoned that maybank remained his top pick as it has a more balanced and diversified portfolio as well as a relatively attractive dividend yield in excess of 5%, which makes the stock a relatively safe haven amid the current

stock markets closed slightly higher on wednesday amid optimism that the economy is showing sufficient strength to weather a global slowdown. november consumer confidence climbed to beyond a

points whilst the dow gained 12.81 points to end at 17,827.75. the fbm klci traded in a wider range of 36.13 points for the week with slightly lower volumes of 2.24 billion to 1.55 billion traded. the

bhd, petronas dagangan bhd, sapurakencana petroleum bhd and telekom malaysia bhd caused the index to decline on persistent profit-taking activities. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since may 2013 have been trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69

indexs obvious support levels are seen at 1,766, 1,805 and 1,827, while the resistance areas of 1,829, 1,858 and 1,896 would cap the indexs rebound. the klcis 18 and 40 simple moving averages (smas) depict a fledgling uptrend for its daily chart. however, the 50 and 200 smas have also issued a dead cross and the index prices are now between these two longer-term smas. therefore, the recent rebound from the 1,766.22 low has obviously stalled at 1,858.09. the indexs trend does not appear to be very clear for now and remains trapped between the 1,766.22 and 1,858.09 levels at the moment. due to the uncertain tone for the klci, we are recommending a chart sell on alam maritim resources bhd (amrb). maybank-ib research has fundamental coverage on amrb. our analyst recently released a review of the results in conjunction with amrbs announcement of its third quarter of financial year 2014 results. our analyst has an unchanged sell call for amrb with a rm0.80 target price. he sees a challenging environment in the offshore support vessels sector notably the small-sized anchor handling tug supply segment, which would be susceptible to weakness in daily charter rates in light of the weak oil price environment. with a softer oil price being in line with the economics teams forecast, our analyst takes the view that the sector derating will stay for some time following adverse headwinds and an oil price recovery back to its pre-october 2014 levels will not happen soon. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that eight research houses have coverage on amrb. of the other eight, there are four buy calls, three neutral calls and a single sell call. this stock currently trades at a reasonable price-earnings ratio of 11.01 times while its price-to-book value ratio of 0.94 times indicates that its share price is trading at a discount to its book value. the reported shareholding changes on bloomberg revealed there was net buying from local investors over the past month. amrbs chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly down. its share price made a massive decline since its major weekly wave-2 high of rm1.46 in september 2014. since that rm1.46 high, amrb fell to its november 2014 recent low of rm0.78. as prices broke below their recent key critical support levels of rm1.37 and rm0.99, look to sell amrb on any rebounds to its resistance areas as the mas depict very firm short- to longer-term downtrends for this stock. the daily and weekly indicators (like the cci, dmi, oscillator and stochastic) have issued sell signals and now depict very firm indications of amrbs eventual move towards much lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm0.81, rm0.99 and rm1.37. we expect amrb to witness weak buying interest at its support levels of rm0.59, rm0.75 and rm0.78. its downside targets are located at rm0.70, rm0.43 and rm0.14.\n  \nlee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank

"title": "trade wise: time to switch from yield to growth as qe3 ends?", "article": " there are a number of very attractive high-yield stocks that offer 5% to 7% returns in malaysia, mark mobius, emerging markets guru at franklin templeton investments, said at a recent media luncheon in kuala lumpur. the expert stock picker also said investors should look at stocks in malaysia individually to determine what the growth rates are going to be and work out how much more these stocks should be worth. at this stage, there are a number of stocks that you can buy, but i wouldnt rush in, he was reported to have said on oct 20. yet rather than recommending the safety in yields, mobius could really be looking for entry points to quality growth stocks. in his oct 28 blog post headlined focus on long-term fundamentals, not fears, he says now seems like a good time to examine the role of investor psychology in the market. i cant say when this current bout of market volatility will end, but i can say, based on decades of experience navigating the markets, it wont last forever. and it will likely bring potential opportunities for savvy investors who know where to look. incidentally, mobius blog post came just a day ahead of the us federal reserves oct 29 announcement of the end of its half-a-decade-long bond purchase programme  the latest of which is better known as the third instalment of quantitative easing (qe3)  meant to jumpstart economic growth. the next day, the us economy surprised the market by reporting its strongest back-to-back growth in over a decade. after growing 4.5% in 2q2014, the us economy grew 3.5% in 3q, beating median forecasts of 3%, according to bloomberg data. even before that, investors wanting to look past chinas bout of poor data releases in august found comfort in the governments effort to support its 7.5% gdp growth target for 2014, including pumping us$81.4 billion (rmb500 billion) cash into the countrys five state-owned banks in september. so, is it time to switch from yield to growth, or at least consider doing so? michael kurtz, chief asia equity strategist at nomura international (hong kong) ltd, whose team upgraded malaysia to overweight from neutral in an asean context on oct 8, thinks so. we are growing wary of yields relative performance prospects in the coming quarters u2026 historically, dividend yield stocks tend to underperform the broad market when treasury yields are rising. and the accepted view is that qe tended to suppress yields by substantially augmenting the bid for bonds. so less or no qe should, other factors being equal, free up yields to rise as the feds bid dries up, kurtz tells the edge. the time to own dividend yield stocks is when bond yields are falling or likely to remain at the bottom indefinitely, not when yields are moving higher, he adds, pointing out that rate strategists at nomura expect treasury yields to rise roughly 60 basis points from current levels by end-2015 as growth, wage inflation and higher short-term rates all get priced into the yield curve. we believe the point is near where demand growth in the us will begin registering more evident us wage inflation, which will have to get priced into long-end treasury yields. lim chee sing, executive chairman of rhb research institute in kuala lumpur, concurs. if nothing else, the end of qe3 means that investors will have to prepare for the next policy move by the fed and this is none other than the normalising of interest rates from an extremely low level, he says. in short, interest rates will rise, but when? for now, most economists expect the fed to hike rates by 3q or 4q2015, if not earlier. in a rising interest rate environment, high dividend-paying stocks that are trading at rich valuations may continue to lose their appeal as the spread between the dividend yield and interest rates [fixed-deposit or risk-free rate] will be narrowing, lim explains. thats why growth over yield is what is being recommended over a 12-month time frame by mixo das, nomuras asia ex-japan equity strategist in hong kong, for lower beta and lower correlation to carry trade returns. the most important deciding factor there is the direction of bond yields (and thus nominal growth expectations and fed policy expectations). earlier this month, the financial markets were pricing in sharp headwinds to growth, which we thought were overdone. economic data, on the whole, has been mixed, but this only means that the outlook for 2015 [which already expects accelerating global growth from 3.2% in 2014 to 3.6% in 2015] should remain unchanged, das tells the edge, pointing out that consensus expectations of the feds first rate hike happening had moved backwards to august from october 2015 after last wednesdays federal open market committee announcement. to be sure, das expects 2015 to see occasional periods of risk aversion, but the overall direction of bond yields should be higher. for malaysia specifically, das had, in a recent note, said risks to earnings outlook remain beyond the near term but there are stock-specific re-rating opportunities. capturing earnings growth at a reasonable price will be a key differentiator of performance, he writes in an oct 15 note. nomuras top picks on a 12-month time frame include malayan banking bhd, ijm corp bhd, gamuda bhd, mah sing group bhd, sunway bhd, axiata group bhd, telekom malaysia bhd and genting malaysia bhd. convinced that the us and global economies will continue to pick up in the months ahead, nomuras kurtz is even more bullish on growth stocks. dividend yield names could underperform even more if investors conclude in the months ahead that growth stocks look more interesting, leading to something of a mass exodus from yield. das adds, the other thing to remember is that yield as a style is a very crowded and expensive trade compared with its own past as well as relative to growth. put another way, the switch from yield to growth plays could also be spurred by the fact that yield stocks have already been chased high. more than 40% premium is currently being paid in global equity markets for the higher-yield quartile of stocks, kurtz says. deep-pocketed pension funds, including the employees provident fund (epf), favour companies with strong cash flow and dividend-paying capability to add to their pool of realised investment gains to pay annual dividends to members. epf a net seller for now, however, bloomberg data lists the epf as the top seller of three of malaysias four major telecoms stocks: digi.com bhd, telekom malaysia bhd and maxis bhd. telecoms stocks are known for their dividends and are favourites during periods of slow growth.  telekoms stock price, in particular, has appreciated over 26% year to date and dividends pushed total returns to 40% over one year. digis stock price is up by a fifth ytd and has delivered total returns of over 27%. the epf still owned 12.73% of digi as at oct 27, but had sold nearly 50 million shares or 0.64% in the past three months from 13.37% as at july 22, filings with bursa malaysia show. it sold about 43 million shares or 1.36% of telekom in the past three months and held a 13.14% stake as at oct 24 compared with 14.5% as at aug 5. filings also showed the retirement fund sold about 11 million maxis shares in recent months with its holding standing at 6.55% as at oct 27 compared with 6.7% as at july 7. based on the lowest analyst dividend forecasts on bloomberg of 23 sen and 21 sen respectively for maxis and telekom, there is a downside of 2.5% for maxis and 16.7% for telekom from their respective oct 30 close of rm6.74 and rm7.20 if one used 3.5% yield as a minimum expectation. for digi, the upside potential is 13.9% to rm6.86, using the lowest dividend forecast of 24 sen and assuming 3.5% yield. forecast dividend per share (dps) for maxis ranges from 23 sen to 32 sen and averages at 27.9 sen, which values the stock at rm6.98, assuming 4% yield. the dps forecast for telekom ranges from 21 sen to 31 sen and averages at 27.3 sen, which values the stock at rm6.83 if one assumed 4% yield. the minimum is above 19.1 sen based on its rm700 million minimum annual dividend promise. perhaps spurred by expectations of a business trust structure happening, the forecast for digis dividend is higher at 24 sen to 29 sen and averages at 26.2 sen, which values the stock at rm8.80 if one assumed 4% yield. among banking stocks  which mobius also recently reported to like, alongside generous dividend payers such as british american tobacco (m) bhd, guinness anchor bhd and carlsberg brewery (m) bhd  the epf pared about 22 million shares or 1.21% of hong leong bank bhd in the past four months. it still held 13.15% as at oct 27, down from 14.36% as at june 19. it is worth noting that the epf said due to its size, it usually chooses to take profit when there is enough buying interest in the market. to be sure, the higher borrowing costs that come with the end of ultra-low interest rates in the easy-money qe era, which drove asset prices higher and fuelled credit growth, are supposed to mean that the us economy is in better shape. as rhbs lim says, the end of qe3 implies that the fed is increasingly more confident of the us economic recovery and there isnt a need for investors to hide behind defensive and high-dividend stocks. still, he reminds investors that the inability of the major world economies to transition from a recovery to an economic boom since the 2008/09 global financial crisis suggests that lack of growth, specifically earnings growth on the part of corporates, is the key problem. this means that to outperform the market, one would need to identify growth stocks to make a difference. at the end of the day, it is earnings growth that will create new shareholder value and bring down valuations to a more attractive level, he remarks. in any case, current consensus shows there may well be some six to nine months before interest rates begin to rise. for investors who still want to have yield stocks in their portfolio, see page 10 for a selection of those with positive quarter earnings growth, single-digit pe multiples and at least 4% yield, according to bloomberg data. yields for 10-year mgs are between 3.82% and 4.12% at the time of writing.  this article first

committee to discuss epf vote on oct 21", "article": " bursa malaysias listing committee is set to meet tuesday to discuss whether it will allow the employees provident fund (epf) to vote on the proposed mega merger of cimb group holdings bhd, rhb capital bhd and malaysia building society bhd (mbsb), says a source familiar with the matter. it (the epf vote) is on the agenda. a decision should be made that day, the source tells the edge. the epf is keen on voting to protect its investments. however, under bursas listing rules, it cannot vote as it would be deemed a conflict of interest as it is the common major shareholder in all three entities. it is the single largest shareholder in rhbcap and mbsb with stakes of 41.5% and 64.6% stakes respectively, and owns a 14.6% stake in cimb. bursa, however, can make an exemption. the listing committee, comprising 10 individuals led by chairman datuk md tap salleh, will be the one to make the call. md tap is president of the malaysian institute of integrity. it is understood that the epf only wants the right to vote at the shareholders meetings of rhbcap and mbsb. both rhb and mbsb had, at the epfs behest, written to bursa to put forwardthe pension funds request for a waiver of the listing rules. bursa, however, required more information from the two companies. according to a bursa source, before the bourse could make a decision on the waiver, it wanted, among other things, the boards of the two companies to make a stand on whether they thought the epf should be allowed to vote on the proposed merger, the edge financial daily reported on oct 10, following a bursa listing committee meeting the previous day. it is understood that by the end of last tuesday, the boards of rhbcap and mbsb had forwarded separate letters to bursa, clarifying some matters that the stock exchange required. the letters were cautiously worded u2026 im not sure that they amount to making a stand, a source familiar with the merger discussions tells the edge. it is against this backdrop that bursas listing committee meets on tuesday. the merger, which will also spawn a mega islamic bank, has been structured such that rhbcap will be acquiring larger rival cimbs assets and liabilities via a share swap. after the cimb-rhbcap merger, their respective islamic banks  cimb islamic and rhb islamic  will merge with mbsb to form the mega islamic bank. if the epf is allowed to vote with its 41.5% stake in rhbcap, the merger is pretty much in the bag if it is for the deal. this is because as the acquirer, rhbcap needs only 50%-plus-one share approval for the deal to go through. if it were the selling party, it would have needed a 75% vote. however, if bursa rules that the epf must abstain from voting, then rhbcaps 21.2% shareholder from the middle east  aabar investments pjs u2013 will hold the trump card. without the epf, aabar will hold a 36.2% vote, which means that if it does not agree to the deal, it will be tougher  though not impossible  for the merger to go through. for it to go through, the merger will need the support of rhbcaps other substantial shareholder, osk holdings bhd, with its 9.9% stake (but a 16.9% vote if epf were out of the picture) and most of rhbcaps minority shareholders, which include investment funds such as skim amanah saham bumiputera and kumpulan wang persaraan. while theres no telling which way aabar will vote, it is no secret that aabar could be a stumbling block to any merger as it has been seeking a high price of rm12 a share for its stake in rhbcap  much higher than the rm10.03 rhbcap was valued at in this deal. aabar acquired the shares at rm10.80 each in 2011 from its sister company abu dhabi commercial bank, a left-to-right-hand transaction, which inevitably set a high floor price for any potential merger transactions. rhbcaps share price, however, has yet to cross the rm10 level in over five years. bursas decision still matters. if the epf is able to vote, it improves the chances of the deal going through. if not, then rhbcap has to bring the deal to shareholders to see if it can get enough votes to see it through, a source told the edge two weeks ago. at the mbsb level, industry observers say whether or not the epf is allowed to vote with its 64.6% stake, the deal is likely to go through as the offer for mbsbs assets and liabilities  at rm2.82 a share  is attractive. mbsb was accorded the highest valuation of the three financial institutions at 1.93 times price-to-book, and the price was a 20.5% premium to its rm2.34 share price on july 9, the day before the parties proposed to discuss a three-way merger. shareholders have the choice of receiving cash or shares in the enlarged islamic bank.  epf ceo datuk shahril ridza ridzuan, in an interview with the edge in mid-september on the funds investments, pointed out that bursas decision on the vote would have implications on the pension funds investments in other listed companies. he highlighted that since the epf owns more than 5% in more than 100 companies, there is a chance it could get caught in a similar situation in the future. that is precisely why we want a ruling decision from bursa because what they rule today will have implications on our investments in the rest of the companies. when asked what would happen if bursa ruled that the epf cannot vote, shahril said: if that happens, then technically we have to be very careful with our investments in the future, like how much we hold in a company. we now have stakes in many companies, like all the big banks, plantation companies, and so on. if we cannot have voting rights in these institutions and they try to do deals with each other, it is very dangerous for us. (if there is) any merger in the banking sector, we would be cut out if we cannot vote because we own stakes in all the banks  maybank, ambank, and so on  so what do we do? he went on to say that the epf needs to decide on a strategy to avoid this kind of situation in the future. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on october 20 - 26, 2014."}, "336": {"date_posted":

traded in a narrower range of 21.97 points for the week with slightly lower volumes of 2.67 billion to 1.69 billion traded. the index closed at 1,815.81 on nov 13, down 0.43 points from the previous day as blue chip stocks like cimb group holdings bhd, felda global ventures holdings bhd, ppb group bhd and umw holdings bhd caused the index to decline on persistent foreign selling activities. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since may 2013 were trapped in rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20

recently. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at the 1,766, 1,800 and 1,810-levels, whilst the resistance areas of 1,815, 1,858 and 1,896 would offer very heavy liquidation and profit-taking activities. the klcis 18 and 40 simple moving averages (sma) depict a downtrend for its daily chart. in addition, the 50 and 200 sma have also issued a dead cross and the index prices are still below these two longer-term smas and below the shorter-term 18 and 40 smas. therefore, the recent rebound from the 1,766.22 low has obviously stalled at 1,858.09. this has opened up downside possibilities for the index once again. due to the bearish tone for the klci index, we are recommending a chart sell on malaysian resources corporation berhad (mrcb). mrcb released its second quarter financial year 2014 (2qfy14) results at the end of august and is expected to announce its 3qfy14 results some time this month. looking at the results announcement, group revenue increased to rm530.3 million in first half financial year 2014 (1hfy14) from rm447.8 million in 1hfy13, while net profit for the cumulative 1hfy14 rose to rm162.7 million from myr18.2 million. the improved profitability was attributed to higher revenue contributions from the property development division mainly from ongoing development projects of q sentral offices and the sentral residences, as well as an exceptional item from the disposal of investment in duke highway. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that nine research houses cover mrcb. of these, eight are buy calls and a single hold call on the stock. this stock currently trades at an expensive 2014 estimated price-earnings ratio of 38.4 times, while its price-to-book value ratio, which is on the high side, trades at 1.29 times. mrcbs gearing remains extremely high at 4.1 times. the return on equity remains low at just 0.6% while its debt-to-assets ratio is marginally above the 50% mark. the reported shareholding changes on bloomberg revealed there was minor net buying from local investors over the past month. mrcbs chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly timeframes is very firmly down. its share price made a decline since its major weekly wave-2 high of rm2.27 in feb 2012. since that rm2.27 high, mrcb fell to its recent october 2014 low of rm1.42. as prices broke below its recent key critical support levels of rm1.70 and rm1.66, look to sell mrcb on any rebounds to its resistance areas, as the moving averages depict very firm short- to medium-term downtrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi and stochastic) have issued sell signals and now depict very firm indications of mrcbs eventual move towards much lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm1.46, rm1.66 and rm1.70. we expect mrcb to witness weak buying interest at its support levels of rm1.21, rm1.23 and rm1.42. its downside targets are located at rm1.38, rm1.09, rm0.94 and rm0.40.  lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed in the article are the opinions of the writer and should not be construed as

bhds proposal to acquire new britain palm oil ltd (nbpol) its blessing. the question is, will kulim (m) bhd, which will be selling its 49% stake in the papuan palm oil producer, distribute all the proceeds from the disposal to its shareholders? last thursday, sime darby surprised the market by announcing that its subsidiary, sime darby plantation sdn bhd, intends to make a cash offer of u00a37.15 apiece for all the voting shares in nbpol. note that this was just a week after sime darby said it was not proceeding with the acquisition following the expiry of the exclusivity period agreed between the parties. given that kulim had previously distributed the entire rm1.16 billion proceeds from the disposal of its stake in qsr brands bhd and kfc (m) holdings bhd, the market appears to believe it will do the same this time around. kulims shares rose 4.62% to close at rm3.40 last friday. however, an midf research analyst opines that kulim needs to hold on to some of the proceeds to expand its businesses, especially in the plantation segment. this is because the disposal of nbpol will leave a big hole in kulims future earnings. kulim needs to use the proceeds for capital expenditure. it needs to keep some of the money to expand its plantation business because nbpol contributes a huge part of the segments profit, the analyst tells the edge. kulims plantation businesses in png and the solomon islands contribute about 30% to the segments operating profit. the operating profit of the plantation segment is bigger than the groups total operating profit (see table). in 2013, nbpol contributed 70% and 65% of kulims fresh fruit bunches (ffb) and crude palm oil (cpo) production  kulim produced 563,984 tonnes of ffb and 180,664 tonnes of cpo. the planned divestment of nbpol may significantly affect kulims plantation performance as 65% of the groups ffb production was contributed by the operation in png and the solomon islands. if the sale of nbpol goes through, we expect kulims earnings growth in the near term to be muted, states midf research in a sept 19 report. the research house says that part of the proceeds from the nbpol sale will be utilised to finance the development of the newly acquired 40,645ha greenfield plantation land in central kalimantan, indonesia. kulim targets to plant 400ha by end of this year, notes midf research. however, as the central kalimantan land is a greenfield project, kulim will not reap much from it for at least the next two to three years. thus, kulim needs to find a way to plug the hole if it wants to maintain its level of earnings, says the analyst with midf research. nevertheless, others expect kulim to distribute the entire proceeds to its shareholders. this is because its largest shareholder, johor corp bhd (jcorp), with a 60.3% stake, would want the proceeds to be distributed so that it can pare down its debts. while jcorp has a large portfolio of assets, it also has huge debts. besides qsr and kfc, jcorp owns stakes in damansara realty bhd, kpj healthcare bhd, damansara assets sdn bhd, johor land bhd and tanjung langsat port sdn bhd, among others. as at dec 31, 2013, jcorp had rm8.63 billion of property, plant and equipment, rm3.55 billion in investment properties and rm1.27 billion of investment in joint ventures. the group had cash and bank balances amounting to rm1.11 billion last year. on the other side of the balance sheet, short and long-term borrowings stood at rm1.63 billion and rm6.93 billion respectively. another analyst says he sees the likelihood of the proceeds from the sale of nbpol to be distributed to kulims shareholders via a special dividend, amounting to about rm2.20 per share. recall that kulim paid a special dividend of 93 sen when it disposed of its stake in qsr and kfc in 2012, he says. the analyst points out that if kulim needs to acquire new assets or businesses to plug the hole left by nbpol, the group could easily raise the funds. as at june 30, 2014, kulims gearing stood at 37.7%. it had cash and bank balances of rm248.9 million as at june 30, 2014, while total loans and borrowings stood at rm2.03 billion. however, its borrowings are also expected to go down, as about 40% of the total was nbpols debts. besides its plantation business, kulim also has shipping and oil and gas-related businesses. the proposed listing of its shipping arm, ea technique (m) bhd, could provide greater financial flexibility for kulim to pursue its investment strategy, says midf research. while it will be good news for kulims shareholders if the group decides to distribute the proceeds from the sale of nbpol, there is a chance it may not do so, or may not distribute the entire amount to shareholders. if the latter happens, it will be hard to justify the almost 5% jump in kulims share price last friday, notes the analyst with midf research. nbpol deal long-term positive for sime darby sime darby bhd has made an offer of u00a37.15 (rm37.34) per share for new britain palm oil ltd (nbpol). sime darbys offer is said to be around 10% higher than that of the other bidders, say sources. the question is whether sime darby will be overpaying for the acquisition, at an 85% premium of nbpols closing price of u00a33.87 per share traded on the london stock exchange (lse) on oct 8, the last trading day before the announcement. according to maybank investment bank research, the quality of nbpols assets and management, scarcity of landbank, and the high cost and high risk of greenfield development, led to the proposed acquisition. besides being 100% certified as a sustainable palm oil producer by the roundtable of sustainable palm oil (rspo), nbpol will provide a gateway for sime darbys expansion into papua new guinea (png), says the investment bank.  the government of png has stated its intention to hold a 30% stake in nbpol, pursuant to the privatisation of the company off the lse. nbpol will be relisted on either bursa malaysia or the singapore exchange. the offer price translates to an earning value per mature hectare (ev per ha) of rm84,200, or about a 15% premium to recent transactions in malaysia. on its short term financial impact, we are neutral to slight negative on the acquisition. the ev per ha of rm84,200 is the highest offered for a listed entity so far. just last month, felda global ventures holdings bhds offer for asia plantations ltd worked out to an ev per ha of rm75,000, according to cimb investment bank research. it is worth noting that nbpols estates recorded an average fresh fruit bunch yield of 23.5 tonnes per ha and an oil extraction rate of 22.5% over the past five years, which is superior to most of its peers, added cimb in a report last friday. we are long term positive on the deal given the potential synergies and opportunities in papua new guinea for future expansion. sime darby gains an immediate foothold in this new market [with the acquisition], says maybank ib. nbpol has over 78,000ha of planted oil palm plantations with a further 10,000ha for future planting, over 7,700ha of sugar cane plantations, and more than 9,000ha of grazing pasture. the company also owns 12 mills and two refineries in png and in liverpool, in the uk. another analyst opines that the acquisition will have minimal earnings impact on sime darby. he estimates an almost zero earnings accretion after taking into account the loss of interest income from the internal funds utilised for the acquisition and additional borrowing costs. [sime darbys] management has provided guidance of 4% to 5% accretion in two years, based on a cpo (crude palm oil) price assumption of us$800 per tonne or approximately rm2,600 per tonne. we believe upside would come from landbank expansion in papua new guinea or synergies extracted from the exercise, says the analyst. nevertheless, nbpols liverpool refinery will complement sime darbys existing downstream business in europe, said uob kayhian in a research note last friday. the liverpool refinery supplies about 95% of traceable sustainable palm oil to the uk market with good premium pricing. the uk is a totally new market for sime darby as it only has one refinery in the netherlands, it wrote. with the liverpool refinery, sime darbys total capacity in the region will increase to 750,000 tonnes per annum, said the research firm. the traceability of nbpols palm oil products as sustainable is also good branding for sime darby to capture the european market, it added.  by kamarul azhar

quantitative easing programme at the latest federal open market commitee meeting on the same day. the s&p 500 index inched down 2.75 points to close at 1,982.30 points, while the dow fell 31.44 points to end at 16,974.31. the fbm klci index traded in a wider range of 28.54 points for the week with slightly higher volumes of 1.58 billion shares to 2.29 billion shares traded. the index closed at 1,842.78 yesterday, up 3.23 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks such as felda global ventures holdings bhd, genting bhd, hong leong bank bhd, ppb group bhd and telekom malaysia bhd caused the index to rise on constant nibbling activities. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013), and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since may 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69 (high), 1,802.88 (low), 1,896.23 (high), 1,837.28 (low), 1,879.62 (high) and 1,766.22 (low). most of the indexs daily signals have turned positive (except the oscillator) recently. as such, the indexs key support levels are seen at 1,766, 1,800 and 1,842, while the resistance areas of 1,847, 1,879 and 1,896 would offer some liquidation and profit-taking activities. the klcis 18 and 40 simple moving averages (sma) depict a marginally uptrend for its daily chart. however, the 50 and 200 sma have also issued a dead cross and the index prices are still between these two smas. therefore, the recent rebound from the 1,766.22 low is seen as a price rebound from oversold conditions. as such, we see diminished autumn selling pressure on the index. due to the rebound tone for the klci, we are recommending a chart buy on hap seng consolidated bhd. hap seng remains in an uptrend, despite the broader market sell-off at the beginning of october 2014 and even made a new 52-week high of rm4.32 on thursday. hap seng released its second-quarter of financial year 2014 results at the end of august. looking at the results announcement, turnover for the quarter recorded a 33% year-on-year (y-o-y) growth while its operating profit grew 513% y-o-y. the improved profitability was attributed to higher revenue from all divisions except the fertiliser and trading divisions. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that no research houses have coverage on hap seng. this stock currently trades at a reasonable price-earnings ratio of 13.2 times while its price-to-book value ratio of 2.51 times indicates that its share price is trading at a large premium to its book value. the reported shareholding changes on bloomberg revealed there was net buying from local investors over the past month. hap sengs chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very strong and is firmly up. its share price has made a great surge since its minor weekly wave-2 low of rm0.30 in october 2008. since that rm0.30 low, hap seng surged to its recent october 2014 all-time high of rm4.32. as prices broke above their recent key critical resistance levels of rm3.53 and rm3.81, look to buy hap seng on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short-to-medium term uptrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) have issued buy signals and now depict very firm indications of hap sengs eventual move towards much higher levels. it would attract firm buying activities at the support levels of rm3.53, rm3.81 and rm4.31. we expect hap seng to attract minor profit-taking towards its only resistance and all-time high of rm4.32. its upside targets are located at rm4.68, rm4.94, rm5.88 and rm7.47.  lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed

investments is demanding a hefty premium for its minority stake in malaysia's no.4 bank, sources say, as the abu dhabi state fund leverages on its amplified role in a $22 billion merger that will create southeast asia's fourth-largest lender. when the malaysian stock exchange last week barred the employees provident fund (epf) from voting on a plan to merge cimb group holdings, rhb capital bhd and malaysia building society bhd (mbsb) due to the state pension fund's majority ownership in the three lenders, the spotlight was suddenly thrown onto secondary shareholders. aabar, which owns 21 percent of rhb, wants its stake in the bank to be valued at 11-12 ringgit per share, sources familiar with the deal said. that would be as much as 11 percent more than what aabar paid three years ago for its rhb holding and above the value placed on rhb of 10.03 ringgit per share in the proposed merger. \"aabar is not happy to take another cut on its investment. they were not happy with the merger talks... looking at the market price for rhb, they know the likelihood of making money on this is negligible,\" said a gulf source close to the fund. but it is not in aabar's interests to derail the deal as a failed merger could drive down shares in the stock market, hurting aabar's investment in rhb, analysts say. under the deal, rhb will issue shares to the much larger cimb, but cimb shareholders will own 70 percent of the merged entity. the islamic banking arms of cimb and rhb would then acquire mbsb to form what would be one of the world's biggest islamic banks. agreement to aabar's elevated valuation could increase the cost of the share swap for cimb shareholders by at least 20 percent, according to reuters calculations. aabar did not respond to several requests for comments. rhb declined to comment, while cimb and mbsb did not immediately respond to reuters queries. \"we believe it is more likely that cimb walks away from the proposed m&a than to be constrained by the remaining shareholders of rhbc/mbsb seeking better terms for a 'favourable vote',\" chris oh, a kuala lumpur-based ubs analyst, wrote in a note. but a failed merger will be a big setback for cimb chairman nazir razak, the brother of malaysian prime minister najib razak, some analysts say, diminishing the bank's stature in the long run. losing the deal could create an opportunity for malayan banking bhd (maybank), the country's biggest banking group, to take another stab at rhb after scrapping takeover talks in 2011. \"the ultimate completion of this deal hinges on the bank's (cimb's) determination on seeing this deal through,\" said kevin kwek, a singapore-based analyst at sanford c. bernstein. \"letting this go can mean maybank steps into the picture, and the limited options available to get larger.\" about making money aabar bought the rhb stake from abu dhabi commercial bank in june 2011 at a rich price of 10.8 ringgit per share, which valued rhb at around $7.2 billion, or 2.25 times its book value. aabar, a top shareholder at a number of international firms, is now keen to make money on the deal after the value of its global assets slumped. aabar's parent company, international petroleum investment co (ipic), took a $3.4 billion writedown on aabar's stakes in unicredit and automaker daimler in 2011. aabar then wrote off $392 million of its $1 billion investment in the commodities trader glencore, less than two years after taking part in its listing. sources say, if all fails, malaysia may turn to its close relationship with the abu dhabi leadership to broker a mutually acceptable deal. osk holdings bhd, the next largest shareholder in rhb after aabar with a 9.9 percent stake, could also be key to the success of aabar's demand. both investors would see their combined voting power in the lender increase to 53 percent from 31 percent now that the epf is barred from voting. osk could follow in aabar's footsteps as it would also benefit from aabar's demand for a higher premium, said an investment banker who used to work with osk, a small financial group built by malaysian veteran broker ong leong huat. but many bankers and analysts see it differently, saying osk is unlikely to do \"anything funny\" and jeopardise the proposed merger. osk officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment."}, "352":

1,784 and 1,800 levels, while the resistance areas of 1,810, 1,823 and 1,879 would offer heavy liquidation and selling activities. the fbm klcis simple moving averages (18, 40, 50 and 200 sma) depict an emerging downtrend for its daily and weekly charts. with the prices breaking below the larger and lower rising wedge support line on sept 15, 2014, we foresee longer-term selling activities for the index. the 50 and 200 sma have also issued a dead cross and fund managers would be selling the fbm klci index and components on any rebound rallies. the selling pressure would be intense and

its recent 52-week high of rm6.49 in august 2014. this is consistent with the sell-off in the technology sector at the beginning of october, which saw the kltech index tumbling approximately 27% from its peak since august 2014. a check on the kltech members reveals that mpi is currently the fifth largest constituent on the index. mpi recently reported its fourth quarter ended august of financial year 2014 (4qfy14) results and is expected to announce its 1qfy15 results in the middle of november 2014. in its announcement, mpi highlighted that revenue growth year-on-year was higher with asia at 3%, the united states at 3% and europe at 16%. the improved profitability for the year was attributed to robust pricing and appreciation of the us dollar vs ringgit, and a shift towards higher margin products and lower commodity costs. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that seven research houses have coverage on mpi. of the seven, there are six buy calls and one hold call. this stock currently trades at expensive price-to-earnings ratio of 19.9 times as well as a high prive-to-book value ratio of 1.3 times. the reported shareholding changes on bloomberg revealed minor net profit taking by local institution funds over the past month. mpis chart trend on the daily and weekly time frame is very weak and is firmly down. its share price made a large plunge since its daily wave-5 and recent high of rm6.49 in august 2014. since that rm6.49 high, mpi plunged to its recent october 2014 low of rm4.19. as prices broke above its recent key critical support levels of rm5.48 and rm5.35, look to sell mpi on any rebounds to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to medium-term downtrends for this stock. the daily and weekly indicators (like the cci, dmi and macd) have issued sell signals and now depict very firm indications of mpis eventual move towards much lower levels. it would attract very weak buying interest at the support levels of rm3.89,

and gas contracts it could benefit from. meantime, weaker year-on-year financial results and a lack of new jobs have dragged knms shares down; but there are catalysts for growth, going forward. at its close of 29.5 sen on sept 18 (thursday), knm-wa was trading at a relatively high premium of 55.1% to the mother share. however, this can be justified by its long lifespan and the low dividend nature of the stock. the american call warrants, which have a strike price of rm1, expire in november 2017, giving investors ample time to ride knms upside potential. the company is expected to perform better in the second half of its financial year, although earnings in the second quarter ended june 30 were weaker  down 7% y-o-y and 27% q-o-q  but not disappointing, notes maybank ib in a recent report. the q-o-q earnings weakness was not entirely a surprise, due to the timing difference in job recognition. geographically, its europe segment reported a 29% or 5.1 percentage point fall in earnings before interest, tax and depreciation (ebitda) and ebitda margin to rm40 million. this was offset by stronger operations in its asia and oceania segment (ebitda: +164%, margin: +7.6 percentage points), the research house adds. it has a buy call on the stock and a target price of rm1.50. thats a 79.6% upside for the stock and 69.5% upside for the warrants at current prices, assuming zero premium. assuming a 20% premium, the warrants would gain 171.2%. the catalyst for the rest of the year could be more contracts, particularly from petroliam nasional bhds refinery and petrochemical integrated development (rapid) complex in pengerang. note that the group in august, bagged us$280 million to us$300 million worth of jobs from the rapid project. we expect more contracts for knm over the next six months, as the subcontracting work at rapid is being progressively delegated. knms current tenders for rapid-related works total us$8 billion, and we expect us$800 million to us$1 billion job wins from rapid over a three-year period, maybank ib says. the companys stock and warrants are worth keeping an eye on, especially if the decline continues and more value emerges.

investment research (june 9): over the weekend, capitaland (capl) announced that, together with concert parties, it has owned, controlled or agreed to acquire (including acceptances) about 97.1% of capitamalls asias (cma) issued share capital. therefore, its stake in cma is now above the threshold to compulsorily acquire the remaining shares.  in our view, the final offer of s$2.35 per cma share, priced at a 28% premium to book and a 3% discount to rnav, is a sensible price equitable to both capl and minority shareholders. we continue to see capls move to delist cma as a rational one that will simplify the groups organisational structure and allow management to deploy significant capital to well-understood cma assets. more significantly, the privatisation of cma will also be accretive to capls earnings and roe, which is now a key focus for management.  the full integration of cma will also enhance the groups capabilities in integrated developments across its key markets

derived target price of s$1.20 translates into a cy15 per of 21.4 times, compared to singapores healthcare sector average cy15 per of 27 times. in singapore, cancer has been the leading cause of death since 2006, and the governments efforts to raise awareness will prompt more people to seek early treatment.  medical oncology is a highly specialised branch of medicine. the collective medical expertise of the professionals at talkmed is not easily duplicated. such entry barriers have resulted in strong operating profit margins (fy10-13 average of 76%) and return on equity (87.5%, annualising 1qfy14). the business requires no capex due to the collaboration with parkway cancer centre. as such, the strong free cash flow allows talkmed to target a 75% payout ratio.  talkmeds challenge is the scalability of its oncology medical services, given that 69.2% of 1hfy13s revenue was derived from its key founder, dr ang peng tiam. whether or not the singapore talkmed franchise can be successfully replicated in the rest of asia remains to be seen. offsetting the attractive 75% dividend payout target are poor liquidity and likely low organic growth.av concept holdings ltdtarget price: hk$0.84 buyebs international (june 10): owing to the strong demand for mobile internet and the rolling out of 3g and 4g services worldwide, demand for smartphones was robust in the past few years. taking into account that the mobile internet penetration rate was less than 30% in 2013, we expect the near-term demand for smartphones to remain strong. av concept is not only the exclusive distributor of samsung cis (cmos image sensors) in china, but also the distributor of mcp (multi-chip package) and ap (arn processors) for samsung. those products are widely used in portable electronic devices, like smartphones and tablets. we expect this business to grow substantially in the coming years. because of lack of scale, av concepts soul headphone business is expected to make a small loss in fy14. with geographical expansion and a new product line coming to the market, we expect this business segment to turn around in fy15. given the huge growth opportunities, the mobile internet business may become its key growth driver later. we are optimistic about the near-term earnings outlook and expect earnings to enjoy good growth in the coming two years. in view of its past volatile earnings, we conservatively set our target price at hk$0.84, equivalent to 0.8 times fy14 estimated price to book or four-year average forward pb. initiate buy. mega financial holding companytarget price: twd27 outperformsinopac research (june 10): we have downgraded mega financial holding company (mega fhc), given the lack of strong drivers for further potential earnings upside. with in-line earnings and having factored in the potential earnings dilution from state-owned m&a, we left our target price unchanged as we believe our 1.3 times book value is justified. 1q14 preliminary net profit reached twd8 billion (30% y-o-y) with eps of twd0.65. the growth mainly came from net interest income (nii) with 15% y-o-y growth. net fee income showed a mild growth of 7% y-o-y. considering the asset quality concerns and one time book value cap, which mega fhc has reached 92% in 1q14, loan growth will slow down while a 1-2 bps net interest margin (nim) expansion quarterly would be achievable amid chinas tight liquidity scenario. net fee income showed a mild 7% y-o-y growth as the strong growth from its securities arm (29% y-o-y) was offset by the decline in the banking arm (-5% y-o-y). for the banking arm, despite an 18% y-o-y fees growth from mutual fund sales on the back of stronger stock market performance, significant renminbi depreciation in 1q14 led to plunges in fees from structured products (-61% y-o-y) and wealth management net fee income (-18% y-o-y). we expect sustainable mild growth in net fee income in 2h14. sri rejeki ismantarget price: idr333 buymaybank kim eng (june 11): sritex has ambitious plans to double its production capacity in five years, guided by its garment-focused strategy. it expects this years growth to be driven by h&m for fashion garments and the indonesian military. h&m is expected to order six million pieces in fy14e, which is equivalent to us$30 million in revenue. production capacity has already been allocated for h&m until end-fy14e. the indonesian armed forces, comprising the army and the police, is expected to double its orders from us$25 million in fy13 to us$50 million in fy14e as the army opens up to a two-uniform yearly allotment. production has already started for these higher-margin products. in may, the vietnamese factories of more than 100 taiwanese companies, including textile companies such as texhong textile, were attacked by mobs in an anti-china riot, the most serious in the country in two decades. such unrest in vietnam, a major garment producer, could cause textile buyers to diversify their sourcing to indonesia. texhong is a major competitor of sritex for yarn. management also confirmed that the effective tax rate on current-year profits would drop from the statutory 25% to 20% in fy14e as sritex has met the 40% minimum free-float requirement. we have factored in the lower tax rate into our forecast. singapore post ltdtarget price: s$1.86cimb research (june 11): we hosted cfo ng hin lee and deputy cfo daniel phua at our 4th annual asia pacific conference. discussions centred on the recently announced collaboration with alibaba and its m&a plans. while details of the jv with alibaba have yet to be set in stone, singpost believes that its partnership with alibaba could increase shipment volumes by three to four times. these volumes will come gradually as both parties will need to integrate their back-end systems, and singpost will over time build significant scale across the region, funded by alibabas s$312 million investment and its net cash of s$170 million. singpost has identified indonesia as a key market in southeast asia, where it is lacking sufficient presence. its subsidiary and key logistics arm, quantium solutions, set up a jv in indonesia this year after the government relaxed laws that previously restricted foreign firms from owning a stake in logistics companies. singpost sees more room for growth through m&a in indonesia as the current jv only serves java and there is also a need to establish delivery networks in other parts of the country. a study by emarketer forecasts that b2c e-commerce sales in indonesia will rise by 37% in 2015. singpost offers an attractive dividend yield of 4% and provides potential earnings upside from the collaboration with alibaba and its m&a activities as it expands its regional e-commerce logistics operations. stay invested. vingroup jsctarget price: vnd78,900 buymaybank kim eng (june 10): the market often overlooks vingroups potential due to concerns about its large and complex structure. however, it is one of the easier stocks for foreign investors to buy, with high liquidity and sufficient room for foreign ownership. vingroup is the market leader in many key real estate sectors in vietnam. thanks to the scale of its business, the company has built significant barriers to entry in a highly competitive market with leading market shares across segments, an excellent relationship with the authorities, and a reputation for timely delivery of large-scale projects. any new capital raised by the company in the planned ipo on sgx could be put into new projects to add value to its asset base. on average, it has been adding five projects, or 2,000ha, to its land bank every year for the past three years. we value vingroup at an rnav per share of vnd78,900, a 17% discount from rnav or 20% upside. most of the latent, incremental value not reflected in the book comes from the development properties in its 7,000ha land bank. we believe the valuation is compelling for a market leader with recurring income as downside protection. in our low-case scenario, we value all early-stage development projects using the sales comparison approach. we assume it can only liquidate each of its development projects at the current market value for land in the vicinity. the fair value derived from our low-case scenario analysis is vnd65,700.venture corp ltdfair value: s$8.24 buyocbc investment research (june 12): we believe venture corp (vms) will be able to benefit from the trend of accommodative policies being implemented by major central banks and governments to support economic growth. these measures have been undertaken because although recent macroeconomic data have largely pointed to a recovery, it appears to be modest and still fraught with uncertainties and downside risks. vms expects improving contribution from customers secured in recent years and also the ramp-up of new programmes from a number of existing customers. recent commentaries by some of vms key customers on their outlook have largely affirmed this. however, there are still pockets of weaknesses, especially in emerging markets, which are facing challenging conditions.  with the 10-year us treasury bond yield and 10-year singapore government bond yield still remaining at low levels and economists also lowering their year-end target on where the former should be heading, we view vms 6.7% fy14f dividend yield as an attractive investment proposition. coupled with a forecasted cyclical earnings recovery growth of 8.7% in fy14 and 11.6% in fy15, which would mark its first positive net profit growth since fy10, we deem it appropriate to upgrade vms from hold to buy, with a higher fair value estimate of s$8.24 from s$7.78 previously. this

the long term. in light of the controversy surrounding the award of the project through direct negotiations, we think that ytl's decision is a good move in the long term, although it is negative in the short term. with ytl pulling out, the ec is likely to call for an open tender for track 4a, albeit on an accelerated basis due to the urgent need for the plant, said the research house. cimb

japan-based orix corp, had each received 16.7 million new shares or 10% of airasia x for rm250 million. while manara has gradually sold down its stake in the airline, it remained a major shareholder for years. manara sold out, a source familiar with the matter told the edge financial daily yesterday. however, it is not known why manara sold all its shares and the identity of the buyer was not disclosed. according to bloomberg data, more than 30 blocks of airasia x shares were traded off market throughout yesterday. a total of 124.08 million shares valued at rm90.65 million changed hands. save for one block of 100,000 shares worth 70 sen apiece, all the shares were sold at 73 sen each. manara was one of the investors roped into airasia x by tan sri tony fernandes aero ventures sdn bhd, along with sir richard bransons virgin group and orix. branson exited from the airline in 2012. orix, via orix airline holding ltd, still holds 124.08 million shares in airasia x. the two biggest

saw it raise us$310 million (rm995 million). on monday, the airline reported its second quarterly net loss since listing of rm11.28 million on revenue of rm749.48 million for its first quarter ended march 31, 2014 (1qfy14). analysts are either neutral or negative on airasia x. five of 15 polled by bloomberg have a sell call on the counter while the rest gave a hold rating. the average target price was 76 sen, with analysts target prices on airasia x ranging from 65 sen to 90 sen. maybank ib research aviation analyst mohsin aziz  who downgraded airasia x to a hold after the long-haul carrier made a worse than expected core net loss for 1qfy14  said the airlines performance continues to be heavily linked to its performance in australia, a market that is said to be extremely challenging. the operating environment, however, is stabilising and results should be in positive territory by 3qfy14 onwards. however, expect 2qfy14 losses to be larger than 1qfy14 as it is a

malayan banking bhd caused the index to rise on some buying activities on wednesday ahead of the labour day holiday. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the indexs price movements in the next few months following may 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69 (high) and 1,802.88 (low). the indexs daily signals are mainly positive, with upbeat cci, dmi, oscillator and stochastic signals. its macd is currently negative though. as such, the indexs obvious support levels are seen at 1,802, 1,852 and 1,871, while the resistance areas of 1,873 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some very heavy selling activities. its simple moving averages depict an emerging uptrend for its daily, weekly and monthly charts. due to its firmer chart signals, we believe investors will remain on a buy on dips tone for the klci. despite the upbeat tone for the klci for may 2014, we are recommending a chart sell for managepay systems bhd. speculative penny stocks have fallen since april 28 and managepay was one of the badly affected stocks. the companys revenue for the fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2013 (4qfy13) rose 75.3% year-on year to rm3.12 million from rm1.78 million in 4qfy12. the increase was attributed to the payment segment as the group had begun delivering credit card terminals for its teksi 1malaysia project. a corresponding increase in profit before tax in 4qfy13 was also recorded from higher revenue and margins from the payment segment. a check of bloomberg consensus reveals that no research house covers the stock. the stock is currently trading at lofty historical price-earnings rato of 140 times and at a high price-to-book value of 2.35 times. managepays chart trend on the daily time frame is much weaker. its share price made an obvious plunge since its daily wave-5 high of 38.5 sen on april 25. since that 38.5 sen high, managepay declined to its recent april 29 low of 19 sen. managepays chart has moved into strong daily downtrends to its recent april low of 19 sen. as it breaks above its recent key critical support levels of 35 sen and 30 sen, look to sell managepay on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to medium term downtrends for the stock. the daily indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and stochastic) are very weak and now depict the firm indications of managepays eventual move towards much lower levels. we expect it to attract heavy selling towards its resistance levels of 28 sen, 30 sen and 38 sen. it will attract weaker nibbling activities at the support levels of 0.7 sen, 0.9 sen and 1.9 sen. its downside targets are now located at 16 sen and 0.3 sen.lee cheng hooi is

earnings, below the fbm klcis 16 times, still have upside potential, said analysts, who remain overweight on the sector in the light of a solid pipeline of projects. maybank investment bank (maybank ib) research said some positive events that have occurred since the beginning of this year have strengthened the pipeline of construction works in the near term as well as in the longer run. they include major construction projects like the rm11 billion project 3b power plant, the rm1 billion langat 2 water treatment plant and the go-ahead for the refinery and petrochemical integrated development (rapid) and the klang valley mass rapid transit line 2 (kvmrt 2). the solid pipeline of projects should propel strong replenishment in construction order book, going forward. this should in turn sustain and even support the construction earnings growth momentum, maybank ib research said in a report on wednesday. it said all eyes are now on the actual job awards from key projects, including rapid and the west coast expressway. maybank ib research said the total of new construction projects awarded last year were well sustained at rm92.3 billion against rm123.6 billion in 2012, which included the kvmrt 1 project worth rm20 billion. the robust projects in the past few years have driven total construction works completed in 2013 to hit a six-year high of rm90.9 billion. despite the bullishness, stock valuations are still lagging behind the fbm klci valuation and below the peak valuations during the previous bull cycle. hence, we continue to overweight the sector, said maybank ib research, adding that shares in gamuda bhd, ijm corp bhd, wct bhd and hock seng lee bhd (hsl) were trading at close to their mean forward price earnings ratio (per) valuations despite their robust fundamentals, but still below their respective peak valuations during the previous bull cycles. in a march 18 note, rhb research institute sdn bhd said the prospects of the construction sector remain strong as it rides on an extended upcycle backed largely by the rm73 billion kvmrt project. with the rm23 billion line 1 currently under construction, and lines 2 and 3 worth rm25 billion each under planning, this mammoth mega project will keep the players busy until 2021, it said. the research house is advocating a two-pronged stock-picking strategy. firstly, go for the high-beta highly liquid big-cap stocks like gamuda, which will take the lead in reacting to new price catalysts such as the cabinets approval for line 2, according to rhb research institute. secondly, look at small-cap stocks such as protasco bhd that is benefiting from other key areas of public infrastructure spending, particularly in public road maintenance and public housing and hsl, which is a good proxy to massive infrastructure spending in sarawak backed by the sarawak corridor of renewable energy, urbanisation and rural development. shares in gamuda closed up five sen or 1.1% at rm4.61 on wednesday, ahead of labour day, while that of ijm rose two sen or 0.31% to end at rm6.38. wct shares were unchanged at rm2.25, but hsl shares fell one sen or 0.52% to rm1.91. this article first

proposed rights issue to raise up to rm5 billion will help bolster its common equity tier-1 (cet-1) ratio, currently the lowest among malaysian banks, to a level more comparable with its peers. the exercise will, however, dilute its earnings per share (eps) and return on equity (roe). this was why investors immediate reaction to the news announced on tuesday was to sell down the shares. the banks share pricefell by as much 1.4% to rm19.88, before gaining some ground to close at rm20.14 on wednesday, just 0.1% lower than the previous days price. the counter was actively traded with some 11.6 million shares changing hands, about 3u00bd times more than that in the previous day. what is positive is that this fundraising would bolster its cet-1 ratio to a comfortable 10.4% thereafter, maybank investment bank (maybank ib) research said in a note on wednesday. we estimate the financial impact to be a 7% dilution to financial year 2015 (fy15) eps and a dilution in the groups fy15 return on average equity from [earlier expectations of] 19.1% to 17.7%, it said. it maintained its sell call and target price of rm18.00 on the stock. cet-1 provides the benchmark on how banks are well-capitalised. public banks cet-1 ratio stood at 8.5% as at end-march, much lower than the industry average of over 12.8%, but comfortably above the minimum 7% that banks need to meet by 2019, as per bank negara malaysias (bnm) basel iii requirements. however, bnm is also considering introducing counter-cyclical capital buffers, which may eventually push up the minimum requirement further. analysts said this may be pushed up by 2.5% at the most. it had been long expected that public bank would need to raise funds to boost itscapital position and it had hinted to analysts that such a move would be done via a rights issue, as opposed to a private placement of new shares. bigger rival cimb group holdings bhd earlier this year opted for a private placement, raising rm3.55 billion to strengthen its capital position. however, analysts were surprised that public bank had decided to undertake the rights issue earlier. it comes much earlier than anticipated as the management has often said it would decide only after bank negara sets the counter-cyclical buffer in 2015/2016. that management has decided to bring this forward could be to take advantage of the recent spike in share price, maybank ib research pointed out. public banks share price surged to a multi-year high of rm20.80 on april 4, following a four-day uptrend during which it gained 8.6%. the interest came after the banks announcement on march 31 that it would merge its local and foreign shares on april 16, a move which lifted its investible weighting on ftses value-stocks asean index. we believe that this is an opportune time to undertake such an exercise given that its share price is riding high which will help to minimise the eps dilution impact, hong leong investment bank research said, adding that it was neutral to slightly positive on the rights issue. public bank said the rights issue would be at a discount of 20% to 35% to its theoretical ex-rights price. the exercise is expected to be completed by the third quarter.  public bank says the rights issue will be at a discount of 20% to 35% to its theoretical ex-rights price and the exercise is expected to be completed by the third quarter. assuming a price discount of 27% [mid-point between the 20% and 35% discount] and a volume weighted average price of rm19.97, we estimate a 1-for-10 rights issue to raise the rm5 billion, maybank ib research said. according to bloomberg data, at least 27 analysts that track public banks stock, most of them (15) have a hold, with seven maintaining a sell and the rest, a buy. analysts said public banks roe, the highest among local banks, has peaked and is now on a declining trend. its roe stood at 20.5% as at march 31. hwangdbs vickers research forecast that the groups roe would be around 19% following the rights issue, which it said is still the highest among malaysian banks. it maintained its buy call on the stock. after the rights issue, pbb investors will no longer need to worry about the bank not meeting the basel iii requirements. in addition, its management will be able to focus solely on growing the business, it said. the research house expects public banks dividend payout ratio (dpr) to stop sliding and assumes that it will be sustainable at 40% up to fy18. the groups dpr has been on a declining trend since fy09, slipping to 44.8% last year, its lowest in about a decade. this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on may 2, 2014."}, "385": {"date_posted": "25/4/2014", "title": "klci looking to test 1,870 and 1,882 levels", "article": " north

loan growth is expected to slow to 9.6% this year a one percentage point drop from last years 10.6%, said malayan banking bhd (maybank) group president and chief executive officer datuk abdul farid

industry growth rate to gain market share, abdul farid told reporters after the banks 54th annual general meeting (agm) yesterday. maybank is targeting a group loan growth of 13% in 2014, underpinned by a growth of up to 20% in indonesia, 12% growth in malaysia, and 13% growth in singapore. when we grew 14% [across loans and deposits growth] last year, we also grew about 12% domestically as well, said farid, adding that there was a time when the local market was growing at about 11%. maybanks loan growth last year was driven by its indonesia operations, which grew 27.9% year-on-year, followed by singapore (13.6%) and malaysia (11.9%). in terms of international operations, the banking group has achieved a loan growth of 17.6%. the first quarter of this year will not show that kind of trend [like last years]u2026 but we are optimistic that for the rest of the year we should be able to achieve the target, said abdul farid. in a presentation, he pointed out that the competitive landscape in the banking industry is putting pressure on loan pricing and funding costs. he also expected changing the macroeconomic environment to result in higher inflation and rising interest rates. additionally, he noted that new regulatory requirements would change the operating landscape for banks and the volatility in financial markets would pose as one of the challenges in the sector. on prospects, maybank group is seeking improvements in terms of profitability. one way to do this, abdul farid said, is by being more disciplined with cost management. we have a strategic cost management programme whereby we look at every cost item diligently. we also have a team that [analyses] whether a cost spent is crucial to the bank or a waste, he noted. chairman tan sri megat zaharuddin megat mohd nor said maybanks diversified footprint across the region also gives it a different perspective on cost management. leveraging the synergies in the different businesses within the group in a more effective way hopefully improves top areas such as cash management, transaction banking and cross-border ipos, he said. through organic and inorganic growth, abdul farid said maybank is on track to meet its target to have 40% profit contribution from its overseas operations by next year.  based on our portfolio at the moment, for us to grow organically we should be able to bring that [overseas contribution] up to 35% by year 2015, he said, but adding that the remainder has to come from inorganic activities. maybank  which has branches in shanghai, beijing and hong kong  has not been able to penetrate into thailand, although it is also seeking growth opportunities in indonesia, singapore and the philippines, among others. we have a few options looking at inorganic growth. thailand is a market that we have not been able to penetrate in a commercial banking perspective.  positive outlook... malayan banking bhd chairman tan sri megat zaharuddin megat mohd nor (left) with group

corporate exercises, he said maybank is not in discussions with any party on a potential reverse takeover (rto) to list 10% of its shares in maybank philippines inc (mpi) on the philippines stock

china reported slower than estimated industrial production and retail sales growth. chinas latest industrial output expanded 8.6%, which was lower than the 9.5% estimated by analysts surveyed by bloomberg. chinas retail sales advanced 11.8% and this was at the slowest pace for january and february since 2004. chinas export concerns also affected the american stock markets and indices there ended up little changed from tuesday. the sp 500 index inched up a mere 0.57 of a point to close at 1,868.2 points while the dow lost 11.17 points to end at 16,340.08 on wednesday night. the fbm klci traded in a narrow range of 15.24 points for the week with lower volumes of 1.61 billion to 1.71 billion shares done. the index closed at 1,818.86 yesterday, up a mere 0.26 of a point from the previous day as blue chip stocks like cimb group holdings bhd, kuala lumpur kepong bhd, petronas dagangan bhd, public bank bhd and rhb capital bhd caused the index to inch up yesterday. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the index price movement in the next few months following may 2013 was trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low) and 1,838.69 (high). the indexs daily signals (like cci, dmi, macd and stochastic) are mainly negative except the oscillator. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at 1,769, 1,799 and 1,813, while the resistance areas of 1,818, 1,839 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some very heavy selling activities. our rebound retracement target of 1,839.26 (62% level) capped the index on march 6. as the index could not penetrate above this key level, it has thrown the klcis onus to the downside, with critical supports of 1,813 and 1,800 in focus again. its simple moving averages (ma) depict a neutral trend for its daily and weekly charts. due to its weaker chart signals, we believe investors will adopt a take profit on rallies philosophy for the klci. due to the softer tone for the klci, we are recommending a chart sell on malaysia airport holdings bhd (mahb), which announced that it has not received the certificate of completion and compliance (ccc) for klia2, which was due on jan 31. a delay in the may 2 opening of klia2 looks imminent, given that the operational readiness and airport transfer (orat) normally takes three to six months to complete post the issuance of the ccc. klia2 is set to be mahbs biggest earnings driver for the year and much optimism on the stock is premised on the project being on track. it is now uncertain when klia2 will be ready for operations and our analyst doubts that the rm4 billion capital expenditure budget is on target. our maybank ib analyst has downgraded mahb to sell with a target price of rm7.03 based on a 2014 price-earnings ratio (per) of 20.5 times bringing near-term valuations more in line with its peers. a check on bloomberg consensus reveals 18 brokers covering the stock. of the 18 research houses that cover the stock, five have a buy call, seven sell and six hold. the stock is currently trading at a high historical per of 25.1 times and a high price-to-book value of 2.11 times. mahbs price trends on the daily chart are weaker. its share price made an obvious decline since its daily wave-5 and all-time high of rm9.78 in december 2013. since that rm9.78 high, mahb declined to its recent february 2014 low of rm7.87. its chart has moved into an obvious daily downtrend to its recent february 2014 low of rm7.87. as it broke below its recent key critical support levels of rm9.43 and rm8.62, look to sell mahb on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to medium term downtrends for this stock. the daily indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, oscillator and stochastic) are very negative and now depict the obvious indications of mahbs eventual move towards much lower levels. we expect mahb to remain weaker towards its support levels of rm6.90, rm7.87 and rm7.90. it will attract heavy liquidation at the resistance levels of rm8.08, rm8.62 and rm9.78. its downside retracement targets are now

retail players appeared to have stopped selling heavily and began picking up mas shares at 24 sen. investors are starting to buy at 24 sen per share after yesterdays heavy selling. our chart also indicates that the share price should rebound at around this level, said goh from sj securities sdn bhd. after the disappearance of mh370 on saturday, many analysts have lowered the target price of mas and its earnings outlook this year. looking at historical air mishaps and the impact on the share prices of asiana, air france and singapore airlines, we observe that share prices declined by 7% to 20% after the first month of the incident, said maybank ib research analyst mohshin aziz. he also sees the incident impacting the national carriers financials and its ability to push for higher yields over the immediate term as near-term customer perception will likely be affected. mohshin also said his hold call on mas at 25 sen and its target price of 26 sen are under review. meanwhile, malaysia airports bhd u2013 from whose airport the ill-fated mh370 took off on saturday -- continued its share slide today. at 11.17 am today, it was trading at rm8.15, down 9 sen or 1.1% on trades of

to close at 24 sen per share on the first trading day following the disappearance of flight mh370 last saturday. as at press time, the search continued. the stock is expected to continue to trade at low levels, although analysts said any weakness is expected to be short-lived and its share price may soon rebound. mas shares opened lower at 21 sen yesterday, after closing at 25 sen last friday. this occurrence is called a gap down, which happens because buy or sell orders are placed before the opening that cause the price to open lower than the previous days close. shares fell to an intra-day low of 20.5 sen, but later recovered to hit an intra-day high of 24.5 sen before ending the day down 4% or 1 sen at 24 sen. mas was the most active counter on bursa malaysia, with 385.06 million shares traded or a 2.3% portion on a share base of 16.7 billion. analysts expect near-term weakness in mas shares following the disappearance of the flight, based on historical mishaps of other airlines and the impact on their share prices. looking at historical air mishaps and the impact on the share prices of asiana, air france and singapore airlines, we observe that share prices declined by 7% to 20% after the first month of the incident, said maybank ib research analyst mohshin aziz. mohshin, however, expects the stock to recover and recoup its losses within three months. he also sees the incident impacting the national carriers financials and its ability to push for higher yields over the immediate term as near-term customer perception will likely be affected. mohshin also said his hold call on mas at 25 sen and its target price of 26 sen are under review. still, with insufficient information of the missing aircraft at this juncture, analysts are of the view that it is too premature to make out the current situation. past aircraft disasters suggest a negative impact on share prices immediately after the incident. while it is too early, with little firm information to reach a conclusion at this stage, we think that the share price is likely to see some knee-jerk reaction from this news  as the most possible outcome [on mas] looks negative at this stage, said amresearch sdn bhd in a note to clients yesterday.  on capacity, amresearch views that mas capacity plan may not be impacted significantly, as the outgoing 777 is to be replaced with a new airbus 330-300. the research firm added that mas expects a net reduction of one aircraft this year, but available seat kilometres is expected to grow by 10% via improving aircraft utilisation from an average 10 hours per day in 2013 to 11 hours 10 minutes in 2014. amresearch has a sell call on mas, with a fair value of 27 sen. hong leong investment bank research analyst daniel wong said in a note yesterday that he expects further selldown pressure on mas in the immediate term. malaysia airports holdings bhd fell 14 sen to close at rm8.24 yesterday. airasia bhd remained unchanged at rm2.52,

years ago to steer the carrier into profitability. his mission has become harder as the national carrier hunts for the lost plane carrying 239 people. the 59-year-old power industry veteran has presided over a 63% slump in the stock, since joining the state-controlled airline in september 2011, battered by unviable routes and competition from low-cost carriers, including airasia bhd. the airline lost a total of rm4.13 billion, over its past three financial years. rescuers have been searching for flight mh370, since it disappeared en route from kuala lumpur to beijing early on saturday, march 08. it is the second mishap in six months.  in october 2013, a twin otter dhc6 plane, operated by its unit maswings, crash-landed in sabah, killing two. that was the first fatal plane accident in malaysia, since august 2009, according to aviationsafetynetwork, a netherlands-based website that tracks safety statistics. when something like this happens, it does impact greatly on the reputation, their ability to turn around, said shukor yusof, an analyst at standard & poors in singapore. also, it casts a negative light on the management and shareholders of the company. mas has seen newer budget operators leapfrogging it, with bigger fleet, with margins eroded on popular routes. ahmad jauhari has also had to contend with some politicians, calling on the government to sell its stake in the airline, which lost rm1.17 billion last year (2013). fourteen out of 16 analysts who cover the stock, have a sell rating, while two recommend hold, according to data compiled by bloomberg. challenges ahead for ahmad jauhari, include boosting worker productivity, while trying to convince travellers to stick with the airline, even after this incident. mas employees are less productive than their counterparts at neighbouring airlines, according to data compiled by bloomberg. they each generate an average of us$222,000 (rm723,720) in annual revenue, less than half the figure at singapore airlines ltd, the data show. workers at thai airways international pcl and pt garuda indonesia persero, each bring in more revenue. maybank investment bank bhd analyst, mohshin aziz, said last year (2013), that the government could raise billions of ringgit, listing some of the airlines units that do make money.  profitable units include the engineering and maintenance business, its airport terminal services unit, and the airlines low-cost rural service, firefly. unprofitable ones are the main airline and the cargo unit, he said.  bloomberg this article first

basel iii-compliant islamic bond sales from malaysia will gather momentum after the debut issue by amislamic bank bhd. won a lower coupon rate than notes sold by the sister company. amislamic bank sold 200 million ringgit ($61 million) of tier 2 basel iii debt due in 2024 at a yield of 5.07 percent last week, compared with the 5.2 percent ambank (m) bhd. paid for similar bonds in december that dont comply with the korans ban on interest. rhb capital bhd. is also planning to issue as much as 1 billion ringgit of the sukuk, according to a stock exchange filing which didnt specify the timing. lenders selling islamic bonds to shore up their balance sheets in accordance with tighter guidelines from the basel committee on banking supervision will help address the shortage of new sukuk, according to the malaysia international islamic financial centre. banks in the middle east started issuing basel iii tier 1 shariah-compliant bonds in november 2012, when abu dhabi islamic bank pjsc sold $1 billion of perpetual notes. amislamic banks sukuk pricing looks interesting because it highlights that investors are eager to purchase these instruments even though the yields are relatively low, eugene tarzimanov, singapore-based vice-president at moodys, said in a feb. 28 telephone interview. there will be more such basel iii sukuk from malaysia and the middle east as islamic banks are growing rapidly and need new capital. basel requirements the basel committee issued rules in 2010 to boost banks capital-adequacy ratios and give them an extra buffer against losses following the global financial crisis that erupted in 2008. lenders around the world have until 2019 to comply with the new standards, which include a clause allowing regulators to write-off capital, such as subordinated debt, if the issuer is in danger of becoming insolvent, or non-viable. malayan banking bhd., cimb group holdings bhd., public bank bhd., ambank and amislamic bank have all sold tier 2 basel iii bonds in the southeast asian nation totaling $1.6 billion, taking issuance to one islamic and four non-shariah-compliant notes. tier 1 capital consists of common equity and additional securities that have equity-like characteristics such as having no fixed maturity, while tier 2 includes debt with a minimum maturity of 10 years. islamic lenders in malaysia have only just started coming up with the right structures for basel iii bonds that comply with both shariah law and the basel committees rules, moodys tarzimanov said. expand horizons there is ample opportunity to innovate new types of basel iii sukuk that can address the capital adequacy needs of islamic banks, according to a report on the malaysia international islamic financial centres website. such innovation offers the potential for shariah-compliant debt underwriters to increase market share and boost the supply of sukuk, it said. an additional market segment of basel iii-compliant sukuk that satisfy regulatory requirements can expand the horizons and usability of sukuk as financial instruments, the mifc said. global issuance of islamic bonds, which pay returns on assets to comply with the ban on interest, climbed 33 percent to $7.6 billion this year after reaching $43 billion in 2013, the second-highest on record after an unprecedented $46.5 billion in 2012, according to data compiled by bloomberg. in malaysia, the worlds biggest sukuk market, sales rose 37 percent to 9.7 billion ringgit this year, according to data compiled by bloomberg. they reached 49 billion ringgit last year, down from 2012s record 95.8 billion ringgit. in the middle east, issuers have sold $6 billion of both tier 1 and tier 2 basel iii notes, data compiled by bloomberg show. lenders in the persian gulf started issuing tier 2 securities in december 2013. favorable demand the amislamic sukuk will set a pricing benchmark for future basel iii issuance from malaysia, khoo poh sim, a senior portfolio manager at bnp paribas investment partners najimah, who helps oversee 554 million euros ($761 million), said in a feb. 28 e-mail interview. we believe the requirement for such sukuk remains strong this year, anchored by favorable demand and supply factors. amislamic banks basel iii sukuk are based on the murabaha concept and are backed by commodity contracts, mohd. effendi abdullah, head of islamic markets at kuala lumpur-based aminvestment bank bhd., the sole arranger for the offering, said in a feb. 28 phone interview. murabaha is based on a three-party arrangement, where the customer places an order with a financial institution to purchase goods from a supplier and sells them back to the client at a mark-up. amislamic banks notes also include the principle of ibra, which is the act of surrendering ones claims and rights to an asset in the event the securities are deemed non- viable by the central bank, mohd. effendi said. we spent quite a bit of time with shariah advisers and regulators to come out with a structure that incorporates the non-viability clause, mohd. effendi said. this will make it easier for other islamic banks to follow as there is demand for such

billion against rm7.8 billion a year earlier. malaysias largest banking group by assets has proposed a final dividend of 31 sen per share for the fourth quarter, bringing its full year dividend to 53.5 sen. however, this is lower than fy12s dividend of 65 sen per share. in a filing with bursa malaysia yesterday, maybank said the groups regionalisation focus continued to bear fruit, resulting in the pre-tax profit (pbt) of its international operations rising 12.7% to rm2.69 billion in fy13. for the malaysian operations, the pbt was up at a healthy pace of 12.1%. strong performance was particularly recorded by bank internasional indonesia (bii), maybanks indonesian banking subsidiary, which continued its impressive upwards profit trajectory. net profit reached a record 1.55 trillion

group net income rose 10.5% to rm18.54 billion, led by a 14.6% y-o-y upswing in net fee-based income as well as an 8.4% rise in net fund-based income.  fee-based income was buoyed by a solid 20.9% rise from investment banking, 16.3% from insurance, takaful and asset management, and 2.9% from community financial services.  key areas of growth were foreign exchange profit, which rose to rm1.13 billion from rm639 million, investment and trading income which rose 15.5% to rm1.29 billion as well as commissions, service charges and fees which grew 11.7% to rm3.54 billion. group president and chief executive officer (ceo), datuk abdul farid alias, said the group experienced a slow first half but quickly re-orientated its focus on growth areas that offered higher potential.  these included areas such as investment banking, global markets, islamic banking, wealth management and transaction banking  which helped us create differentiated value propositions to clients, as well as build our ancillary businesses such as deposits and fee-income. at the same time, we enhanced our organisational structure to harness the strengths of our regional network and resources, which have borne fruit.  farid said the group will focus on accelerating its regionalisation target and focus on key markets that will still be performing well this year, which includes singapore, indonesia, the philippines as well as hong kong and china. on another development, farid said maybank will list at least 10% of its shares in maybank philippines inc (mpi) on the philippines stock exchange by end-2015 to meet

5.45%, with 111.05 million shares traded. its market cap now stands at rm4.34 billion. yesterdays closing price works out to a 16.13% fall in the airlines share price since feb 18 when it announced a net loss of rm343.43 million for the fourth quarter ended dec 31 of financial year 2013 (4qfy13), its largest in the past 10 quarters. for the full fy13, the group posted a net loss of rm1.17 billion, up 170% from the previous years net loss of rm432.6 million. for mas largest shareholder, khazanah nasional bhd, which has a 69.37% stake in the airline, the share price fall translates to a paper loss of rm581.7 billion. the second largest shareholder is the employees provident fund with a 1.04% stake. nonetheless, mas share price is still a good 11.5% higher than analysts consensus of 23 sen, based on 11 reports. all the analysts have placed a sell call on the stock, with target prices ranging from as high as 28 sen by maybank kim eng to as low as 14 sen by cimb research. mas losses had

by 17% and 27% respectively from the previous year. load factors rose from 74.7% to a commendable 81%. the airline, however, saw its costs for fy13 growing much quicker. the losses were pinned on higher fuel costs as the ringgit weakened by 4.7% year-on-year to 3.21 in the fourth quarter even as oil prices fell by 3.7% in the same period to us$129 (rm423) per barrel, noted cimb research in a report last week.  the ringgits weak outlook does not bode well for mas either. as at yesterday, the ringgit had weakened further to 3.2802 against the greenback. in addition, mas will have to contend with increased competition both domestically and internationally. our survey of announced capacity schedules up to july 2014 indicates that mas (and airasia x bhd) is struggling to digest a huge expansion of capacity to australia in late 2013/early 2014, while malindo air is launching new routes to india and thailand, competing directly with mas. hence, fierce domestic competition in 2013 is

to invest another rm20 million by the third quarter (3qfy14) in omi alloy (m) sdn bhds plant to double its capacity to 500,000 units by fy15. we now expect fy14 earnings to flatten out due to: (i)

exchange this year as many as two islamic bonds worth 100 million ringgit ($30.4 million) each, an official with the bourse said. \"we are in engagement with them, and definitely we will see at least one or two issuances this year,\" jamaluddin nor mohamad, head of islamic and alternative markets at bursa malaysia, said in an interview. the expected issuance is necessary to promote bursa malaysia as a market for retail sukuk, he said. danainfra is so far the only institution to have issued sukuk on the bourse's exchange traded bonds and sukuk (etbs) platform. danainfra raised 300 million ringgit with a 10-year sukuk in january 2013 and 100 million ringgit with a 15-year sukuk in october. the issues targeted retail and corporate investors with limited access to the over-the-counter market in bonds, where investments must be done in large minimum sums. proceeds of danainfra's issues go towards extending the mass rapid transit network to cover the klang valley and kuala lumpur conurbation. negative perception danainfra's sukuk issues this year will serve to correct a \"negative perception\" that etbs bonds are more costly than raising funds on the otc bond market and equity market, jamaluddin said. danainfra's debut sukuk, the first on etbs and an entirely new type of product, had to be priced at a premium to attract investors. \"it was a one-time decision by the issuer for the inaugural issue. the message we are sending out is that premium pricing is not the only way out, or you don't have to go down that road.\" danainfra's second sukuk, priced based on otc rates, was oversubscribed 2.19 times. bursa malaysia is now courting several financial institutions and government-related agencies to be issuers on etbs. \"we continue to engage corporates on a direct basis, and explain all these intricacies and also put forward the incentives that have been put in place by the government.\" issuers enjoy a double deduction on expenses and are exempted from stamp duty until 2015. \"what we want to achieve here might not be reflected in monetary benefit on an immediate basis - this is a long-term commitment,\" jamaluddin said. retail interest malaysia's securities commission launched a framework in september 2012 for retail investors to buy into bonds and sukuk. etbs offers an opportunity for retail investors to diversify, although its new nature means it is often evaluated in the same way a stock would be, said jamaluddin. \"they are going back to typical equity-type thinking, chasing yields.\" danainfra, in an emailed statement to reuters, said the major challenges had been educating retail investors about the general structure of sukuk, and the net benefit of investing in danainfra relative to other products. retail investors took smaller portions of danainfra's sukuk than institutional buyers. \"we expect issuances in the immediate future to still be driven by institutional investors, nevertheless retail demand may gather momentum,\" said danainfra. maybank, cimb group holdings, rhb investment bank and aminvestment bank - lead arrangers or market-makers for the danainfra sukuk - have been informing retail investors about etbs. \"these things will enhance the ability to attract investors on the coming issuances,\" said jamaluddin. \"etbs is still in its infancy stage as an investment product, the education and development of the market still has a long way to go,\" said danainfra."}, "438": {"date_posted": "17/2/2014", "title": "midday market: klci rises 0.55% as asian markets extend gains ", "article": "

east to boost the groups new landbank gdv to rm9 billion ytd, and total gdv to rm29 billion (2,755 acres). we maintain our forecast for now, pending completion of the land deal. unbilled sales remain

and consensus full-year estimates respectively, despite revenue rising 14% over the year.  this was mainly due to a rm2 million one-off start-up cost for the new gummy production line, higher labour cost arising from the minimum wages at rm3 million per annum, higher freight charges, and poor product mix from the lower margin beverage products. in the absence of these incidents, earnings could have been better, compared with year 2012.  post 9m13 results, we have lowered our fy13 to fy14 net profit forecast by 33% to 35%, to rm18.5 million and rm22.4 million respectively. cocoalands fair

malaysian resources corp bhdfair value: rm1.32 neutral  rhb research (dec 10): we downgrade mrcb from a trading buy, cut our fy13 numbers to a loss from a profit, and lower our fy14 forecast by 76%, as we believe it will have to overcome several company-specific issues and headwinds in the property sector, before it can capitalise on its enlarged size and scale for growth, post-merger with the gapurna group. we believe mrcb has been hit by a perfect storm, made up of a number of issues that will take time to be addressed, namely: 1) the shocking rm167 million provisions in its latest quarterly results; 2) its recent removal from the shariah-compliant list; 3) the legal tussle with the selangor government, over the acquisition of lot 12 of pj sentral; 4) the long-overdue issue on the eastern dispersal link in johor; 5) delay in implementation of the redevelopment of the rubber research institute land; 6) the impact of overall weakened sentiment, and hence, sales, in the property market, and investors reduced appetite towards property stocks; and 7) investors lack of familiarity with the new management and management style.dayang enterprise holdings bhdtarget price: rm6.02 outperform  publicinvest research (dec 9): dayang has proposed to undertake a one-for-two bonus issue of up to 275 million new ordinary shares. subject to the exercising of the bonus, the share price will be adjusted to rm3.57 (assuming the closing price is rm5.35). the bonus issue will be capitalised from dayangs share premium and retained earnings, and is expected to be completed by 1q14. with ongoing contribution from topside maintenance services, coupled with higher fleet utilisation, we believe the group is in a healthy balance sheet position, to undertake the exercise. as for expansion strategies, it acquired an offshore accommodation workboat, which is expected to be delivered by 4q, as part of the fleet expansion plan to provide marine support offshore oil and gas (o&g) facilities. it strengthened its presence in the o&g sector, by sustaining a strong asset base of nine marine vessels. it also chartered marine vessels from its 26%-owned perdana petroleum, for the pan

assumption of not more than rm30 million liabilities). ske owns 26,794ha of plantation land in kalabakan in sabah, of which 2,979ha has been planted. the deal is expected to be completed by 2q14. assuming an enterprise value per ha of rm50,000 for the immature planted area, the remaining 23,800ha of greenfield land would be worth rm6,300/ha. this seems fair, given that the land is hilly, which is less favourable than flat/undulating terrain for plantation estates. tshs net gearing will rise to 0.7 times, upon completion of the deal  below managements target cap of 0.8 times. the access to greenfield land in sabah could accelerate tshs planting programme, given the more stable regulatory framework in malaysia. we nudged up our target price by 40 sen, after incorporating the acquisition of ske. we continue to like tsh for its strong growth prospect. land & general bhd target price: 65 sen trading buy  hwangdbs vickers research (dec 10): l&gs earnings are on a strong upward trajectory, underpinned by about rm800 million unbilled sales for [emailprotected] and damansara foresta phase 1, which will be completed in the second quarter of 2014 and final quarter of 2015, respectively.  this works out to four times fy13 property development revenue, translating into a rm200 million profit, to be recognised over the next three years. in 2014, l&g is planning to launch rm1.5 billion worth of residential projects. we expect take-up to remain relatively resilient for prime location and landed properties.  it trades at a discount, in part likely due to scepticism over some related-party transactions. since tan sri david chiu took over the helm, there have been four major rpts with his affiliated mayland and hong kong-listed far east group. however, its 70% discount

to the black with rm19.9 million in profit.  the heavy industries segments 3q13 ebit jumped 46% q-o-q to rm35 million, because of greater work progress for the second batch of littoral combat ships

based on a 10% discount to an sop value of rm3.38 per share. sunway on dec 6, 2013, announced a 9mfy13 core net profit of rm325.4 million. however, 9mfy13s effective tax rate was at only 17%, vis-u00e0-vis our projected corporate rate of 25%. hence, we deem the result to be within expectations. for 9mfy13, property development contributed significantly to the earnings improvement, as the divisions revenue and estimated ebit surged 43% and 33% respectively, with high billings from developments in sunway south quay, sunway velocity and sunway nexis. as at sept 30, 2013, unbilled sales stood at rm2.2 billion, compared with rm2.41 billion a year earlier. launches as at november 2013, totalled rm1.7 billion. construction also boosted the groups performance, as the divisions revenue

the first 1,000 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd), from rm13.70, while the remaining 200 to 300 mmscfd of imported liquefied natural gas, will be supplied at a fixed price of rm41.68 per mmbtu. the tariff revision will be a boon for tnb, as this may potentially mark the commencement of the much-anticipated fuel costs pass-through mechanism, that will allow the company to pass on the fluctuations in fuel costs, to the end-consumer. we lift our core earnings forecasts for fy14 and fy15 marginally higher, by 1.5% and 3.2% respectively. given that positive reforms are materialising, we peg a revised fy14 p/e multiple, at 15.4 times. maintain buy recommendation.  berjaya sports toto bhdtarget price: rm4.54outperform public invest research (dec 3): berjaya sports toto announced that it has aborted its proposed listing of stm-trust on the singapore exchange, due to the current challenging market conditions and the poor performance of listed yield stocks, such as reits and other business trusts in singapore. we have always been apprehensive of the proposal, deeming the risk of capital loss to investors holding stm-trust units being higher than the gains from the special dividend, and 8% yield promised from the listing of stm-trust. most business trusts in singapore have performed poorly post-listing, with average returns of -29% from ipo prices, despite relatively high yields. with the cancellation, it is back to square one for btoto. therefore, we revert our valuation method to the dividend discount model, and adjust our target price from rm4.42 to rm4.54. we also upgrade our call to outperform. btotos share price has declined 10% since the beginning of 2013, and with the overhang of the proposed listing removed, we believe the stock will rebound, supported by its strong dividend yield.  supermax corp bhd target price: rm3.50buy ta securities research (dec 4): glove citys development will run concurrently with the proposed supermax business park. in november 2013, the group acquired 100 acres of industrial land in serendah, for rm78.4 million.  an integrated glove-manufacturing complex will be built on 60% of the land. the complex, to be developed in two phases over nine years, will have a capacity of 15.5 billion pieces per annum. management does not expect any shortage of natural rubber and nitrile butadiene rubber, in the foreseeable future. in view of the hike in electricity rates in 2014, management anticipates higher cost of rm3.5 million in fy14, which translate into 2.5% of earnings. we impute the new fy13, fy14 and fy15 total installed capacity of 17.8 billion, 23.1 billion and 29.9 billion pieces per annum, respectively. hence, we raise our fy15 earnings estimate by 6.2%, to rm189.2 million. we continue to

35.4% respectively, to reflect our more upbeat outlook on the companys performance, after our recent meeting with management. earnings momentum should continue, supported by a planned 50% capacity expansion to cater for the roll-out of its test and measurement equipment, which are outsourced by agilent, and an increase in the output of its bread-and-butter radio frequency (rf) products for avago. we believe that the strong growth underpinning inari techs rf division, is the rising rate of long-term evolution (lte) adoption, which is a natural progression of 3g. according to independent reports, global lte subscription will hit two billion within the next five years, sealing inaris prospects in this fast-growth, high-demand area. we continue to like inari, as it is involved in the smartphone and tablet business, which will fuel its earnings growth, at least over the near term. glomac bhdtarget price: rm1.26hold ta securities (dec 4): glomacs 1hfy14 core net profit came in within expectations, accounting for 48% of our full-year estimates. sales during the period stood at rm265 million, a contraction of 31% from the previous year. the absence of new launches was the cause of the decline. the groups unbilled sales remained stable at rm858 million, as at october 2013, versus rm852 million a quarter ago.  following the announcement of cooling measures under budget 2014, management expects some short-term consolidation in the market, as consumers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. therefore, glomac has decided to re-strategise its fy14 launches, to focus on landed residential products, which are least impacted, and hold back the launch of commercial properties. hence, fy14 launch estimates have been revised downwards to rm1 billion, from rm1.3 billion previously. we tweak our discounted cash flow-base revised net asset value per share estimate, to rm1.26 per share, from rm1.45 previously. given an upside potential of 14.5%, we downgrade glomac to hold from buy.matrix concepts holdings bhdtarget price: rm4.80outperform kenanga research (dec 3): outperform recommendation and target price of rm4.80, based on a 20% discount on its revised net asset value of rm6 per share. we like the stock on account of developments in seremban, negeri sembilan, and kluang, johor, which enjoy growing demand. it is also reaping higher margins, because of low land costs.  after netting off dividends and expected acquisitions, the group has an estimated rm110 million for land purchases. assuming that land cost is 10% to 15% of gross development value (gdv) and a net gearing limit of 0.3 times, the group can replenish up to rm800 million to rm1.1 billion worth of gdv, from fy14e onwards. for fy13, we believe that the total dividend payout will be 60% (due to the exceptional dividends arising from fy12), which implies a net yield of 9.4%. we expect fy14e dividend payout of 45%, which implies a yield of 7.8%. valuations are also attractive, since matrix is trading at 6.6 times and 5.8 times fy13e and fy14e pers, respectively. bumi armada bhdtarget price: rm4.40buy maybank ib research (dec 4): bumi armada continues to benefit from lukoil. it has secured long-term charters for three new offshore support vessels (osvs) worth us$500 million (rm1.59 billion), commencing 2014. this is positive for earnings and complements its presence in filanovsky, russia.  meanwhile, the letter of award for the kraken floating production, storage and offloading vessel, is slightly delayed, but should be made known in a fortnight.  these osv contracts are for 10 years (us$262 million), with the option to extend for another 10 years (us$221 million). the vessels are scheduled to begin work in november 2015. pending delivery of these vessels, bumi armada has secured an interim contract worth us$18 million, to provide two support vessels and one rescue vessel for one year of work, commencing november 2014. we estimate that these ice-class osvs will generate a revenue of us$26.2 million, and an ebit of us$5.2 billion to us$6.6 million (20% to 25% margin) annually.  perdana petroleum bhdtarget price: rm1.70outperform kenanga research (dec 4): perdanas bonus share issue went ex on dec 3, 2013, increasing its share base by 40% to 727.2 million. perdana had announced in august 2013, a 2-for-5 bonus issue. we are positive about the bonus issue, as it will enhance trading liquidity of the stock. medium-to-long-term prospects are stable, on the back of perdanas long-term contracts. for its existing vessels, at least 10 are chartered until 2018-2019, and three are until 2014-2015. only four vessels  one accommodation barge and three anchor handling tug supply vessels  are on spot charters, which perdana is confident of securing recurring contracts. the enlarged share base reduces our target price to rm1.70 (versus rm2.50), based on an unchanged target price earnings of 14 times (in line with its two-year historical average forward earnings ratio of 14 times, seen in 2007-2008), on its cy14 earnings per share of 14.6 sen. as there is still a 19% upside, we are keeping our target outperform call on the stock.axiata group bhdtarget price: rm7.20hold maybank ib research (dec 3): indonesias ministry of communication and informatics has approved xls proposed acquisition of axis.  axiatas indonesian subsidiary xl will be allowed to keep axis entire 1,800mhz spectrum (15mhz), hence achieving its aim of the acquisition. nevertheless, we expect a relatively muted impact on axiatas share price, given the diminished significance of xls share price in recent times. recall the rationale of the deal was purely for spectrum, and a key risk was the ministry ordering the partial or full return of spectrum. xl will be required to return axis entire 2,100mhz spectrum (10mhz).  xl was initially expecting to retain 5mhz in this band. nevertheless, xl is already well-endowed in this band and in our view, management is unlikely to lose sleep, over this. after completion of the deal, the merged entity will have 45mhz of spectrum.at present, axis is loss-making (at the ebitda level) and hence, the merger will be earnings dilutive to xl, in the near term.  kossan rubber industries bhdtarget price: rm4.29buy alliance research (dec 3): kossan announced that it is acquiring 9.26 acres of freehold industrial land in mukim kapar, for rm19.37 million. we are positive about this move over the long term, as it is in line with the groups strategy to replenish its landbank, to cater for capacity expansion.  we understand that the land is strategically located near to its factories in klang, and is well-connected with the infrastructure for glove manufacturing, including natural gas supply.  we believe that this site will only be developed in 2015, with a target production capacity of six billion pieces of gloves per annum. this translates into a 30% additional capacity, from the estimated production capacity of 20 billion pieces per annum as at end-2014.  kossans balance sheet remained healthy, with a net gearing of just 12.6% as at september 2013. we reiterate our strong buy call on kossan, with an unchanged target price of rm4.29, based on 16 times fy14 p/e. this implies 16.5% capital upside, with a fy14 net dividend yield of 4.1%.  this story first appeared in the edge

in lacklustre trading. ibm, amd and coach posted lower revenue numbers. the sp500 index inched up 1.06 points to close at 1,844.86 points while the dow jones industrial average fell 41.10 points to end at 16,373.34. in malaysia, the fbm klci traded in a downward range of 15.63 points for the week with volumes of 1.52 billion to 1.84 billion done. the index closed at 1,808.31 yesterday, down 5.79 points from wednesday as blue-chip stocks such as british american tobacco (m) bhd, cimb group holdings bhd, felda global ventures holdings bhd, ppb group bhd and rhb capital bhd caused the index to decline on foreign selling yesterday. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed.  the price movements in the index in the months following may 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low) and 1,882.20 (high). the indexs daily signals are mainly negative. the cci, dmi, oscillator and macd are negative while the stochastic is positive. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at 1,759, 1,780 and 1,801 points, while the resistance areas of 1,808, 1,838 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some heavy profit-taking activities.  our downside targets of 1,795, 1,760 and 1,730 for the index in the short term have now emerged out of the bearish price moves since dec 31, 2013. its simple moving averages (ma) depict a mixed tone for its chart time frames. its daily chart has turned negative, while the weekly chart is neutral but the monthly chart appears buoyant for now.  due to its mixed chart signals, we believe investors may adopt a take profit philosophy as the klci remains at fairly lofty levels with bearish divergent signals. as such, profit-taking on index components as well as small to mid caps will persist into the next fortnight before and after the chinese new year holidays. concerns over the local higher bond yields (especially on the 10-year bonds), a consistent weaker tone for regional currencies against the us dollar and persistent foreign fund equity selling may keep the index and local markets under further pressure for a potential decline. due to the lofty tone of the klci, we are recommending a chart sell on kpj healthcare bhd, which is a rm3.4 billion market cap company with a return on equity of 10.3% based on its 12-month trailing earnings. it seems that the recent weakening of the ringgit and the downward klci movement are causing investors to shift towards a more defensive position towards more cash.  despite kpj being a healthcare bellwether, it was not spared. the steady decline in its stock price could be attributed to weaker profitability and losses at the groups three newly opened hospitals, namely kpj bandar baru klang, kpj pasir gudang and pt khasanah putera jakarta medica. maybank ib does not have fundamental coverage on kpj. a check on bloomberg consensus reveals 13 brokers have coverage on the stock, with two brokers having a buy call on the stock, six sell calls and five hold. the stock is currently trading at a lofty historical price-earnings ratio of 30 times and a price-to-book value of 3.3 times. kpjs indicated dividend yield is at a low 1.86%. kpjs chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames are weak indeed. its share price made an obvious plunge since its monthly wave-2 high of rm4.14 in december 2013. since that high, kpj declined to its recent january 2014 low of rm3.30.  its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly downtrends to its recent low of rm3.30. as it broke above its recent key critical supports of rm4.23 and rm4.02, look to sell kpj on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term downtrends for this stock.  the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci and macd) are negative and now depict the obvious indications of kpjs eventual decline to much lower levels.  we expect kpj to remain weak towards its support levels of rm3.04, rm3.11 and rm3.30. it will attract major liquidation activities at the resistance levels of rm3.52, rm4.02 and rm4.23. its downside targets are now located at rm2.89,

super group", "article": " (jan16): super group ltd. may be the best takeover option for beverage companies anxious to corner a piece of asias expanding instant-coffee market, as long as theyre willing to pay up. the maker of super coffee sachets offers suitors established brands and a distribution network across southeast asia, said uob kay hian pte. japans kirin holdings co. and suntory beverage & food ltd. are among logical buyers that may need to offer at least $2.2 billion to convince supers founders to sell, said malayan banking bhd. such a bid would be the most expensive relative to net income for any coffeemaker in asia, according to data compiled by bloomberg. regional demand for food and drinks has climbed with rising wealth, and no peer in developed asia has increased profit faster than super in the past five years, the data show. southeast asias instant-coffee market is projected to expand 38 percent from last year to almost $4 billion in 2017, according to euromonitor international. super will definitely be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the increasing consumption, james koh, an analyst at maybank in singapore, said in a phone interview. the appeal here is you have a market leader in its space and you immediately get access to some very attractive markets. candy chng, a singapore-based spokeswoman for super, didnt reply to an e-mail seeking comment on potential bids and didnt answer calls to her mobile phone. kan yamamoto, a spokesman for kirin, declined to comment, as did suntory beverage spokeswoman tazuko ikeda. instant coffee super, which sells owl-branded coffee and instant cereal, owns factories from china to malaysia, its website says. branded products account for about 65 percent of the 27-year-old companys revenue, while food ingredients make up the rest, according to supers most recent quarterly results. its unusual for instant coffee makers of supers size to control their raw materials and production -- and thats part of the companys allure, according to alfie yeo, an analyst at dbs group holdings ltd. in singapore. super offers any potential buyer solid brands, an integrated ingredients and manufacturing chain, and an extensive marketing reach in southeast asia, yeo said in an e-mail. tokyo-based companies such as kirin, suntory beverage or asahi group holdings ltd. would probably have to pay more than s$5 a share to buy or take control of super, said maybanks koh. that would be at least a 36 percent premium to yesterdays closing price of s$3.69. today, the shares climbed 1.4 percent to s$3.74 at 11:08 a.m. in singapore, the first gain this week. expensive bid a s$5-a-share bid would be valued at s$2.79 billion ($2.2 billion), or about 29 times analysts average estimate for net income this year. no coffeemaker in asia has ever fetched such a multiple, and the industry median worldwide is 16, data compiled by bloomberg show. all the possible buyers named by maybank have a history of targeting assets in southeast asia. asahi in 2011 laid out plans to buy assets across southeast asia as part of 2015 revenue goals, while kirin failed in an effort to buy the food and drinks unit of singapores fraser & neave ltd. takuo soga, a spokesman for asahi, declined to comment when asked if the company would be interested in acquiring super. suntory beverage suntory beverage, the maker of orangina and other soft drinks, said last year that it was prepared to spend about $5 billion on deals. its parent suntory holdings ltd. this week agreed to buy beam inc., which makes jim beam and makers mark whiskey, for $16 billion. super is a very good platform for japanese acquirers, said koh at maybank. you have the distribution, you have the local know-how, and then on the japanese side, typically they have very strong product research and development. as demand for instant coffee in southeast asia grows, consumption in myanmar will expand at the fastest pace, according to euromonitor. sales in thailand and the philippines are the highest in the region, euromonitor data shows. super introduced new branded coffee products in the expanding chinese market in august. in a market dominated by nestle sa, demand for instant coffee in china will surge 52 percent between 2012 and 2017, euromonitor said in march last year. even as freshly ground brews gain popularity, instant versions will account for 98 percent of total china sales in 2017, euromonitor said. profit growth super generated average annual earnings-per-share growth of 21 percent in the past five years, according to data compiled by bloomberg. that beat 15 drinks makers in developed asia with a market value greater than $1 billion, including kirin, singapores yeo hiap seng ltd. and coca-cola amatil ltd. in australia, the data show. supers profit may rise 11 percent in 2015 to s$108.8 million, according to analysts forecasts compiled by bloomberg. any food and drinks company looking to improve its southeast asian distribution -- a difficult and time-consuming task -- could consider buying super, andrew chow, a singapore- based analyst at uob, said by phone. in myanmar, for example, supers market share is as high as 50 percent, chow said in a report last month. in china, its share is insignificant so far, he said. because super expanded its branded coffee in china only in august, shareholders may resist any acquirer before those efforts yield results, chow said. appeasing founders they may not be that keen unless the price is really ridiculous, he said. if they can graduate from an ingredients supplier in china to a consumer-branded supplier, there should be an argument for higher valuations. the founders of super are unlikely to sell for a price as low as s$5 a share because the stock was near that level as recently as august, chow said. supers shares have surged more than fivefold in the last four years. chairman and managing director teo kee bock, who pioneered supers combination of coffee, creamer and sweetener in one sachet, and two other founding directors owned about 33 percent of the shares as of march 2013, according to the companys 2012 annual report. super may be more likely to buy assets than be acquired, said yeo, the dbs analyst. darren teo, teo kee bocks son and the head of corporate strategy and business development, said in july that super was planning its first acquisition in a decade, looking for coffee makers with established brands. that may not stop bidders pursuing super to accelerate southeast asian expansion, said chow at uob. its not easy to build up distribution very, very quickly, he said. the attraction of super group is their strong distribution and decent branding."}, "458": {"date_posted":

the latex glove segment. its share price has declined 15% over the past five months on softer demand for latex gloves but has yet to reflect the latest plunge in latex cost for the company, commented maybank ibs analyst lee yen ling. the research house has upgraded its rating to buy for top glove with an unchanged target price (tp) of rm6.2. the stock is now trading at 15 times 2014 price earnings ratio (per), below its historical mean of 17 times and its peers forward pers, added lee. we maintain our earnings forecasts for now, a sustainably low latex price would trigger earnings upgrade from us and potentially across the street lee also reiterated buy on kossan (tp: rm4.5) and hold on hartalega (tp rm7.1). the research house believes that the sector will likely see another energy cost hike in 2014 from gas tariffs but believes that the glove makers would be able to pass on the cost to customers, given this is an industry wide cost inflation. given that the gas bills account for 5-9% of glove makers production costs and assuming a rm3/mmbtu gas hike, we estimate the adverse impact on the bottom line will be only 2%, says lee."}, "459": {"date_posted": "15/1/2014", "title":

as investors sold off after china manufacturing figures expanded at a slower pace in december 2013. asia declined yesterday despite the better us december consumer confidence figure of 78.1 and the s&p october case-shiller housing data that gained 13.6% over the past year. the s&p500 gained 7.29 points to close at 1,848.35 points whilst the dow rose 72.37 points to end at 16,576.66 on tuesday night. in malaysia, the fbm klci traded in a downward range of 33.37 points for the week with volumes of 1.25 billion to 1.50 billion done. the index closed at 1,852.95 yesterday, down 14.01 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like kuala lumpur-kepong bhd, petronas dagangan bhd, petronas gas bhd, public bank bhd and tenaga nasional bhd caused the index to decline on some post-window dressing profit-taking activities yesterday. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the index price movements in the next few months following may 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low) and 1,882.20 (high). the indexs daily cci, dmi, macd and oscillator are positive. as such, the indexs obvious support levels are seen at the 1,800, 1,828 and 1,848 levels, while the resistance areas of 1,852, 1,868 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some heavy profit-taking activities. our upside targets for the index are now at 1,898, 1,900 and 1,924 for the medium term. its simple moving averages (ma) depict a triple time frame (daily, weekly and monthly) uptrend for now. due to its positive signals (except stochastic), we believe investors may adopt a nibble on dips philosophy as the klci remains at fairly lofty levels with bearish divergent signals. as such, profit-taking on index components as well as small- to mid-caps may persist after the december 2013 year-end window-dressing period. despite the lofty tone of the klci, we are recommending a chart buy on tiong nam logistic holdings bhd, which is a rm622 million market-cap company with a return on equity of 12.4% based on its 12-month trailing earnings. the stock made a new recent high of rm1.50 in tandem with the improving sentiment of the small- and mid-cap stocks.the firm rise in the stock prices can be attributed to investors optimism on its strong earnings trend. tiong nams stock price continued to surge after the announcement of results for the second quarter ended sept 30 of financial year 2014. the stock price hike indicated that investors approved the profit contribution from its property development segment. no property development revenue was recognised in the corresponding period a year ago. according to the company, its revenue for logistics and warehousing services also improved due to an increase in transportation and rental rates as well as higher occupancy rates of its warehouses. maybank ib does not have fundamental coverage on tiong nam. a check on bloomberg consensus revealed that only one broker has coverage on the stock, with a hold call. the stock is currently trading at a reasonable historical price-earnings ratio of 16.7 times and a price-to-book value of 1.96 times. tiong nams indicated dividend yield is at 1.62%. its chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames are very strong indeed. its share price made an obvious surge since its weekly wave-2 low of 19 sen in may 2012. since that 19 sen low, tiong nam surged to its recent high of rm1.50.  its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to its recent high of rm1.50. as it broke above its recent key critical resistances of rm1.22 and rm1.33, look to buy tiong nam on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term uptrends for this stock.  the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, stochastic and oscillator) are very strong and now depict the obvious indications of tiong nams eventual surge to much higher levels. we expect it to remain very firm towards its support levels of rm1.22, rm1.33 and rm1.44. it will attract minor profit-taking activities at the resistance levels of rm1.50, rm1.73 and rm1.86. its upside targets are now located at rm1.88, rm1.94, rm2.28 and rm2.47. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed in the article are the opinions of the writer and should not be

shares closed at rm4.82 on nov 6, having gained close to 11% since late august, due to various corporate developments  the latest being the conglomerates proposed acquisition of the remaining 70% stake in kesas holdings bhd that it does not already own, for rm875 million.  its warrant, gamuda-wd, has also risen over the same period. it gained 34% to rm2.18 on nov 6, from rm1.62 on aug 28. it is noteworthy that the movement in gamuda-wd  which has a strike price of rm2.66 per share and a one-to-one conversion ratio  closely reflects that of its mother share, as indicated by its 0.41% premium to the underlying share on nov 6. over the past one year, the highest premium achieved by the warrant was a meagre 3.02%. based on maybank ib researchs rm5.30 target price on gamuda in a nov 6 report, gamuda-wd could theoretically have an upside potential of 21%, based on its nov 6 closing price. assuming zero premiums to the mother share, gamuda-wd may rise to rm2.64 apiece (rm5.30-rm2.66), if the mother share meets the rm5.30 target price.  while there are five other call warrants issued for gamuda, all of them will expire between november 2013 and early 2014. with new catalysts just around the corner, gamuda-wd may well see further buying interest, before its may 25, 2015 expiry date. on the proposed acquisition of kesas, maybank ib research says it could potentially boost gamudas fy2014 and fy2015 net profit, by 5% and 12% respectively. the research firm notes that the offer, which represents an equity value of rm1.25 billion for 100% of kesas, is 14% below its discounted cash flow valuation of rm1.45 billion for the concession. we think this could be a prelude to something bigger for gamuda, such as the potential consolidation of its toll assets, with a view of listing them under a business trust, it says. according to maybank, the move to fully own kesas is a strategic one, given that the highway concessionaires net profit has recorded a compound annual growth rate of 121%, over four years (fy2008 to fy2012). post-acquisition, 100% of kesas profit contribution would be reflected in gamudas net earnings. alliance research concurs, maintaining that the acquisition will be a net positive for gamuda. as a result, the firm is maintaining a buy rating on the stock, with a target price of rm5.66. while the rm875 million cash purchase may put a dent on gamudas balances, alliance believes this can be offset by the disposal of splash holdings bhd, a 40%-owned associate, which is targeted for 1q2014. as part of the water assets negotiations between gamuda and the selangor government, the former is set to receive rm734 million in cash, should the deal go through, it adds. this story first appeared in the edge weekly edition
