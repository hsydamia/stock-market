exchanged. the counter previously saw a rally in late december 2017 up to earlier this month, to touch a six-month closing high of 45.5 sen, spurred by the climb in crude oil prices to above the us$65 per barrel mark. at the time of writing, brent crude was trading at us$69.14 per barrel according to bloomberg data. in a note today, aminvestment analyst alex goh said the counter was downgraded as its share price had rebounded above the research house's target price of 30 sen per share, based on a 40% discount to its diluted book value of 50 sen per share. goh said he does not expect any near-term re-rating for umw-og, as even at full rig utilisation at current day rates, the company will be barely breaking even, notwithstanding the group's efforts to draw cost efficiencies with a stronger credit profile amongst suppliers and financiers. while goh said there may be 12 rig charters materialising for the company in 2018  compared to five in 2017  he said these may be short-term charters to replace contracts expiring in 2018. \"even at near full rig utilisation of 90% in 3qfy17, umw-og still suffered a minor core loss of rm4 million. as there will be three rigs out of charter in 1qfy18 or utilisation rate of 60%, we expect a resumption of losses for the group. \"given that the group will incur one-off recapitalisation and rig impairment costs in 4qfy17 amid persistent losses against the backdrop of jack-up charter rates which are just about breaking even, we view the 19% share price discount to its estimated diluted book value as too low,\" goh added. on umw-og's announcement yesterday that it has secured a three-year umbrella contract from petronas carigali sdn bhd for the provision of hydraulic workover units (hwu), goh noted that there has not been any call-out or work order under the contract that commenced on dec 22, which will be made at stipulated price, for those hwu services. the contract, which involves maintenance and remedial treatments for an oil or gas well, may comprise a series of individual orders with a term of three years with a one-year extension option. \"currently, hwus represent a minor part of the group's asset base and currently register losses for the group given that the hwus are largely idle over the past year. while this award is mildly positive for the group, our forecasts are maintained as the utilisation of these hwus do not have a high degree of certainty,\" said goh.

 peter bellew ceo, malaysia airlines bhd\n(june 2016 to october 2017) the position as the ceo of a beleaguered legacy airline is not something that many people would want to take, but bellew was pushed into the spotlight after his predecessor mueller resigned after about a year at the helm. bellew carried on khazanah nasional bhds 12-point recovery plan for mab, which aimed to return the national carrier to profitability by end-2017 and undergo a relisting by 2020. bellew was confident of turning around mab. after all, he had been making announcements periodically about the airlines operational performance from the get-go, telling the world that the transformation of the group was on track. however, things at mab started to get controversial when the airline went to the us as part of prime minister datuk seri najib razaks state visit to the white house in september. during the visit, in which najib famously proclaimed the malaysian governments intention to help strengthen the us economy, bellew signed a memorandum of understanding (mou) with boeing for the purchase of eight boeing 787 dreamliners, a wide-body aircraft, in a deal that was worth us$2.5 billion (rm10.2 billion). the media started to treat the mou as if it were a firm order by mab, which the airline later denied. it stressed that it had only entered into firm orders for 25 boeing 737 max, while other arrangements were only to allow the group to be flexible in making decisions about its fleet replacement and expansion programme. had mab firmed up the mou and ordered eight dreamliners, it would have more than doubled its long-haul, wide-body fleet, which consists of six airbus a350 xwbs. this would mean a diversion from the earlier vision, which was for mab to become an airline with extensive regional networks, rather than intercontinental. following the brouhaha in regard to the purchase of eight dreamliners, rumours started to swirl among industry players and observers that bellew was under pressure to sign the mou by certain parties, to make the visit to the white house more impactful. there was even an article in a local daily saying that bellews departure was due to khazanahs interference in the running of mab, which khazanah strongly denied. what is interesting in the way bellew left mab is the press conference that came with it. bellew had called for a press conference to explain why he had resigned from mab, citing his love for ireland as the main reason for his departure. more interesting was how bellew went on to criticise tun dr mahathir mohamad during the press conference, after the former prime minister alleged that the irish man quit mab because of the governments meddling.  captain izham ismail ceo, malaysia airlines bhd the man who was appointed to succeed bellew is not really new to mab. after all, he started his career in the aviation industry in 1979, with the then malaysian airline system bhd (mas). in the current airline group form, izham was the coo from sept 1, 2016, and played an integral role in the ongoing execution of the turnaround plan. however, to the malaysian public, he is the new kid on the block. what is he made of? will he be able to steer mab to sustainable profitability through professional management practices? besides being a seasoned pilot, izhams management skill was first cultivated when he joined mas flight operations management team in the 1990s. his major accomplishments include leading the y2k air operations for the flight operations division of mas, as well as leading the division for the introduction of the airbus a330-300 and the boeing 777-200 to service. his areas of expertise include managing projects related to flight operations, and planning and managing fleet operations and training requirements. his first senior position in mas came in 2012, when he was appointed director of operations and, later, senior vice-president of operations and development. under the leadership of mueller, izham was appointed head of the operations programme management office, overseeing more than 100 projects, which were key to the turnaround of mas. he is also one of the directors of mab kargo, and the ceo of maswings. his vast experience, from pilot to flight operations and management to air freight, gives izham all the required knowledge to keep mab on the right course. commenting about his appointment to the top post of mab, izham says it is both an honour and a big responsibility. he is looking forward to making the national airline the pride of the nation again. with both mueller and bellew putting mab on track to soar again, it is, therefore, a huge responsibility for izham to ensure that the national airline does not go off course. can he do that and will khazanah, being the sole shareholder of mab, give him the necessary support to steer the national airline forward?

metal aluminium holdings bhd by the time press metal was included as an fbm klci constituent on dec 18, the largest integrated aluminium producer in southeast asia already had a market capitalisation of close to rm20 billion. it may be hard to imagine that the stock just crossed rm1 billion market capitalisation barely five years ago, in early 2013. by end-2016, its market capitalisation had risen to nearly rm6 billion, double what it was the year before. when rhbs former analyst ng sem guan started coverage in june 2013, the comparable (adjusted) share price was 39.7 sen. four-and-a-half years on, the stock is up a whopping 1,154% to rm4.98 as at dec 15. total returns are six times higher, with press metal paying dividends every quarter for the past three years, up from twice a year before that, bloomberg data shows. it also had a two-for-one stock split and 40% bonus issue in 2016. ng was also acknowledged for his early buy call on press metal last year. according to bloomberg data, rhbs muhammad syafiq mohd salam reiterated a buy recommendation when assuming coverage on aug 17 this year. in a note dated nov 1, he told clients that press metals size (rm16 billion marketcap) meant that it could be included as an index constituent, about a month before the inclusion was announced. press metal, which ran 113% from the start of the year to rm3.32 on aug 17, appreciated another 50% over four months to rm4.98 on dec 15  bringing total gains for the year to 213%. at the time of writing, rhb still had a buy recommendation and its rm5.30 target price  the highest among four analysts tracking the stock  implying only 6.4% upside potential. risks to his forecast include a sharply weaker greenback, lower aluminium prices and unexpected production disruptions. a notable mention also goes to kenanga researchs voon yee ping, who also rightly stuck with a buy recommendation this year despite the strong price gains. two other houses had neutral calls from april and august when the stock was below rm3.50, bloomberg data show. it remains to be seen if press metal will provide reasons for further bullishness but the stock did reach rm5.47 intraday on dec 4, although its highest close so far was rm5.184 on nov 6.  nomura researchs tushar mohatas call on sunway construction group bhd in a nutshell, this is a winning call because the stock price ran shortly after an upgrade to buy from hold. but theres more depth than that. when nomura researchs tushar mohata upgraded sunway construction group bhd to buy on march 9 this year, the share price rose 45% within nine months to as high as rm2.41 on dec 11, before retracing to rm2.38 on dec 15. before the upgrade, the stock price had largely been hovering between rm1.50 and rm1.60 for about a year. his decision to upgrade sunway construction resulted from what he calls an earnings-cash flow matrix as well as the law of diminishing returns at a time when most construction companies were already sitting on record-sized order books. a high base means small and medium-sized project awards could mean very little incremental impact on future earnings and share price. that came after he revisited nomuras investment thesis for the malaysian construction sector. while net profit remains the best long-term predictor for stock price returns, he told clients that the cash conversion of reported earnings was becoming equally important due to rising gearing in a weak property market. the latter was the reason tushar preferred pure-play malaysian contractors like sunway construction to diversified contractors with exposure to property development. according to him, sunway constructions earnings fairly accurately track its actual cash flows, reflective of its healthy margins and timely collection from customers. thats a better position than companies which may have good reported earnings but subpar conversion of it to operating cash flow due to reasons such as non-cash earnings stream and growing working capital, which leads to higher gearing (thus burdening the balance sheet). a notable mention also goes to macquarie researchs aiman mohamad, who has had a buy call on sunway construction since at least march 2016, according to bloomberg data. both nomura and macquarie currently have the streets most bullish target price of rm2.80.  affin hwang capital researchs kevin lows call on inari amertron bhd inari amertron saw its stock price more than double this year. affin hwangs kevin low, started coverage as early as april 23, 2013, when the comparable stock price was 16 sen. he continues to like inari, calling it a preferred pick for the local technology sector due to its solid growth in the rf segment given new drivers, including the osram iris ir chip, and its data server chip business from broadcom. key downside risks to his recommendation include a slowdown in global demand for smart devices, rapid average sale price (asp) erosion, loss of customer base and the introduction of new technologies that may render inaris products obsolete. according to bloomberg data, there is currently one fully valued call from dbs vickers with a rm2.25 target price. six analysts have hold or neutral calls on inari while the remaining six (including low) recommend as buy. time will tell who will prove prescient this time next year. this year, a notable mention also goes to macquarie researchs anand pathmakanthan, as clients would have benefited from his upgrade from neutral to outperform in january when the stock price was rm1.60. similarly, rhb researchs kong heng siong upgraded his call to buy when the stock price was rm1.90 on march 22. credit suisses danny chan, who started coverage with an outperform call on july 11 when the stock was at rm2.13 apiece, also deserves a notable mention.   affin hwang capital researchs kevin lows call on kesm industries bhd when starting coverage on kesm industries on aug 15, 2016, affin hwangs kevin low told clients the company was a good proxy for the stable and growing automotive semiconductor segment, going by growing demand for electronics for vehicles from safety to infotainment and autonomous vehicles. in just four months, the stock has gained 34%  making him a winner last year. he continues his winning ways this year: at rm19.50 on dec 15, kesm shares had doubled from the start of the year  and theres still upside if lows rm21.80 target price is to be believed. in fact, kesm reached as high as rm20.50 intraday on nov 23 before closing at rm20.40. we favour kesm for its exposure to the automotive space, an area we believe will continue to benefit from structural growth underpinned by increased semiconductor content in automobiles as well as growth in demand for hybrid and autonomous vehicles, low wrote in a dec 18 note, reiterating his buy call. in an earlier note dated nov 24, he told clients that kesms revenue and earnings momentum remained strong, underpinned by aggressive capital expenditure into the automotive burn and test business. he also noted that 1qfy7/2018 net profit would have been stronger if not for higher effective tax rate of 15.5% versus 10.4% in 1qfy7/2017. key downside risks include a loss of customers and a reduction in the outsourcing opportunities as customers increase their in-house burn-in and test function, he says. two other analysts have since started coverage on kesm this year, according to bloomberg data. cimb research has an add rating and rm22 target price while kenanga research is going against consensus with an underperform call and rm18.40 target price, which is below open market prices. it would be interesting to see if low will make it a hat trick next year.   kaf seagroatt & campbell securities mak hoy kens call on econpile holdings bhd econpile holdings shares have gained as much as 77.6% this year, closing at rm3.195 on dec 4. even measured from this years cut-off date of dec 15, gains came to an enviable 73%. in a dec 29 note last year, kafs mak hoy ken retained his buy call. he sees econpile as the research houses top small-cap construction pick for its burgeoning order book, sustained job momentum and attractive margins. the civil engineering contractors market capitalisation breached rm1 billion in late october 2016. back then, he also told clients that more strategic opportunities could stem from econpiles 60:40 tie-up with china communications construction co (m) sdn bhd (cccc) for a substructure and ancillary works package for suke highway, as it was a strong endorsement of econpiles position as a piling specialist in malaysia. at the time of writing, maks target price of rm3.33 implies only 7% upside potential from rm3.11 on dec 15. it remains to be seen just how much comfort should be drawn from his oct 20 note, where he said econpiles earnings visibility remains solid, backed by a healthy outstanding order book of rm1.2 billion or around 2.1 times its construction revenue. meanwhile, macquarie researchs aiman mohamad, who started coverage with an outperform call on feb 23 this year when the stock price was at rm2.07 apiece, also deserves a notable mention, with econpile shares up 50.2% to rm3.11 apiece in about 10 months. macquarie has a rm3.50 target price.  \nkaf seagroatt & campbell securities mak hoy kens call on ann joo resources bhd with shares of ann joo resources bhd up 83% to rm3.80 as at dec 15 this year, investors who bought the stock at the start of the year would be sitting on good portfolio gains. kafs mak hoy ken maintained a buy on the stock with a higher target price of rm2.42 (from rm2.38) on jan 5. the stock dipped to rm2.17  its lowest this year  on jan 3. at its peak, it closed as high as rm3.91 on nov 9. back then, ann joos share price had just gained 224% in 2016 and there were doubts in the market on whether the stock would continue to perform, especially with the direction of international steel prices being mixed at best. mak was held to his belief that there was more upside to ann joo. among other things, he argued that domestic steel prices would see support from provisional safeguard duties on imported bars and wire rods. with the counter trading at only eight to 10 times forward earnings multiples, he was convinced it was a cheaper alternative play to the malaysian infrastructure supercycle. there is also a potential lift from a continued recovery in chinese steel prices as capacity cuts in that country gathers pace. chinese steel prices have been on a general upward trend this year as the countrys supply-side reforms took effect. a notable mention goes to maybank investment bank researchs lee yen ling, who upgraded her call for ann joo on aug 16, 2016, when the stock price was at rm1.72. at the time of writing, maybanks lee has since downgraded her call to hold with a rm3.85 target price while kafs mak continues to call a buy with a rm4.10 target price. watch this space.  \nkenanga researchs desmond chongs call on malaysian pacific industries bhd it was almost as if he had a crystal ball. when kenanga researchs desmond chong upgraded his call on malaysian pacific industries (mpi) from market perform to buy on jan 27, the stock price ran up 79% from rm7.97 to rm14.291 on oct 11. helping the gains were the better sales that mpi was seeing of its automotive electronics and power management chips as well as improved efficiency. he subsequently raised his target price three more times to as high as rm15.70 on aug 18. thats not all. when chong turned cautious on its outlook and downgraded mpi to market perform or a neutral stance on nov 10, the stock price retraced 12% fromrm13.64 to rm12 on dec 15. in a nov 10 note issued following a briefing, he highlighted the mounting pressure on margins coupled with a potential setback from a longer gestation period for its product rationalisation exercise. a special mention also goes to kaf seagroatt & campbell securities shafiq kadir and ta securitiess paul yap, who earlier had buy calls that also proved right. kenangas call got more points as mpi shares ran shortly after his upgrade compared with the two existing buy calls. all three currently have hold calls on mpi, in line with consensus. at the time of writing, affin hwang capital research had the only sell on the stock, with a target price of rm12, according to bloomberg data. will he have the last laugh next year?  \nuob kay hian researchs ridhwan effendys call on kerjaya prospek group bhd investors who made money might recall that uob kay hians retail research team started coverage on kerjaya prospek as far back as january 2016 when it was still called fututech bhd. the team called the stock an upcoming mid-cap construction company that would emerge as an end-to-end building contractor with rm2.7 billion order book after completing the acquisition of two privately-run construction companies. at the time, the (adjusted) stock price was rm1.69. as at dec 15, it had gained 134% to rm3.97, although that is off as high as rm4.08 on nov 3. this year, alone, kerjaya shares were up 83% at the time of writing. on jan 3, uobs ridhwan effendy told clients that 2017 would continue to be an eventful year for kerjaya  which stands out as a potential capital management play  given its strong cash pile of rm107 million or 10% of its market capitalisation back then. according to bloomberg data at the time of writing, uob is the only house still calling a buy on kerjaya, while the remaining two houses with active coverage have neutral or underperform. the underperform call, made in early august when the share price was rm3.54, but the stock is at rm3.97 currently. uob upgraded the stock to buy again on nov 23 with a higher target price of rm4.53 (from rm3.81) after raising its earnings estimates as well as order book win assumptions. ridhwan continues to like kerjaya for its superior margins, high order book cover, net cash of rm163 million (28.9 sen per share) and ability to clinch new contracts.  \nuob kay hian researchs ridhwan effendys call on sunsuria bhd uob kay hian was the first house to initiate coverage on sunsuria nearly three years ago. at the time, the headline recommendation was hold, based on a 50% discount to its sum-of-parts valuation. nonetheless, the research house told clients that it expected the company to take on a major asset acquisition strategy: investors with the risk appetite for small-caps should consider re-entering ahead of the announcement which is expected to be in 1q2015, it said in a brief note dated feb 18, 2015. that gives this submission an edge over others. based on where the stock is today post the corporate developments, the equivalent (adjusted) stock price would be 86.8 sen. a simplistic measurement would show a 78.6% gain at its recent peak of rm1.55 on july 14, 2017. uob kay hians ridhwan effendy raised his target price to rm1.25 (from rm1) when reiterating a buy call on jan 12 this year as he expected sunsuria to enter a multi-year growth phase. riding on the success of xiamen university, ridhwan expects its flagship sunsuria city development to be a key driver for sales and earnings. sunsurias stock price took only about a month to reach the new target price and on feb28, ridhwan raised the target price to rm1.50  which the stock hit on april 10 before retracing to rm1.40-levels. on may 25, ridhwan downgraded the stock to hold with an unchanged target price after the release of the companys 2qfy2017 earnings, telling investors to capitalise on their gains as he believed its near-term potential had been reflected after a 42% year-to-date climb. at the time, the stock price was rm1.41 and the highest it went was a 9.9% rise to a recent high of rm1.55 on july 17 before retracing to rm1.34, about 5% lower than at the point of downgrade.  \naminvestment bank researchs alex gohs call on petronas gas bhd aminvestment banks alex goh got it right when he cut petronas gas to sell from hold on nov 18 with a rm16.65 target price while the stock was trading at rm20-levels. from there, the price skidded 22% to as low as rm15.88 on nov 30. the magnitude of the fall is considerably sharp, given that petronas gas is a big-cap counter with a market capitalisation of rm33.6 billion. in fact, between nov 18 last year and the recent low on nov 30, it lost a whopping rm10.1 billion in market capitalisation. when downgrading his call more than a year ago, goh told clients about the chances of impending earnings erosion given the energy commissions upcoming plan to implement incentive-based regulation (ibr) tariffs on the groups gas transport tariff. that made it hard to justify the companys valuation and share price of above rm20. on dec 5, goh seemed to have also rightly upgraded petronas gas to a hold with a rm16.65 target price when the share price was at rm16.10. closing at rm16.96 on dec 21, the stock had gained 5.3%. meanwhile, it is worth noting that ta securities analyst kylie chan also had a sell call on the stock, according to bloomberg data, when many others on the street still said hold.  \ninter-pacific securities researchs wong ling lings call on uchi technologies bhd 2017 has been a spectacular year for uchi technology, as was inter-pacific securities researchs wong ling lings buy call on the company. the companys share price had gained between 13% and 30% a year between 2012 and 2016 and this year was beginning to look that way as well until a sharp rally occurred from the middle of the year, barely a fortnight from the time she started coverage on the stock with a buy call. uchis performance likely surprised even her. only three analysts are actively tracking uchi, according to bloomberg data. when wong started coverage on june 15, uchi shares were at rm1.84 a share. from there, it rocketed 93% in just over five months to rm3.55 on nov 29. at rm3.45 on dec 15, uchis market capitalisation stood at rm1.57 billion compared with about rm800 million just six months earlier. wongs buy recommendation was premised on the companys stable earnings growth, unique business model, a minimum dividend payout ratio of 70% of profit after tax, very comfortable profit margins and a clientele comprised of industry market leaders. it would be interesting to see if uchi, which specialises in the design of electronic control systems for a number of multinational companies that are global leaders in their respective industries, can continue to surprise on the upside next year.  \nhong leong investment bank researchs jeremy gohs call on george kent (m) bhd this time last year, hlib researchs jeremy goh was the only analyst actively tracking george kent, telling clients that the water meter-turned-engineering company had rm5.1 billion engineering order book and can no longer be ignored. today, he is one of three analysts calling a buy on the company he described as one with 68 sen per share net cash and a key rail play with exposure to the lrt extensions. his target price is currently rm3.90. closing at rm3.62 on dec 15, george kent shares had gained 83% year to date, continuing its ascent from the year before. in a dec 7 note after the companys third quarter earnings briefing, goh noted that george kent  which is the leader for water meters in malaysia, with over a 50% market share  could see the opening of a whole new market for itself when it commercialises its automated meter reading (amr) product, which allows remote reading of water meters. selangor is expected to call tenders for amr meters in two months for a pilot project while johor and penang are also looking to replace traditional meters, goh said. the company (via a joint venture with siemens) is also preparing to put in a bid for the kuala lumpur-singapore high-speed rail (hsr) asset company (assetsco) that will help develop key parts of the project. that may provide further catalysts for the stock next year.  \nuob kay hian researchs kong ho mengs call on sapura energy bhd when analysts rushed to revise their buy and neutral calls on sapura energy bhd in early december, after a large quarterly net loss, uob kay hian researchs kong ho meng stood out as he had had a sell call for close to six months. the stock tumbled 20% in a single day on dec 7, after the group announced a quarterly net loss of rm274.4 million for the third quarter ended oct 31, a sharp contrast to a net profit of rm158 million the year before. looking back, we see that the share price had in fact been drifting lower since mid-june when the consensus view was that the oil and gas giant was in calmer waters as the recovery of global crude oil prices gathered steam. kongs timely downgrade of his call from neutral to sell on june 20 would have saved clients from sizeable portfolio losses. from rm1.67, the stock price tumbled 53% to 78.5 sen at our award evaluation cut-off date of dec 15. when the edge went to print, the stock price had slid further to a record low of 71.5 sen on dec 21. a notable mention goes to credit suisses danny chan, who also went against the grain with a contrarian sell call since june, although he prematurely upped his recommendation to neutral while the counter was still heading south.  \naffin hwang capital researchs ng chi hoongs call on jaks resources bhd jaks resources is not well tracked by analysts, many of whom may feel the need to observe the company from the sidelines for the time being since its power generation project in vietnam will only start contributing in 2020 and be a good source of recurring income. the lack of coverage makes affin hwang capitals ng chi hoongs buy recommendation and analysis stand out even more. those familiar with the company would know jaks is undertaking a us$1.87 billion 1,200mw coal-fired thermal power plant project near hai duong, together with china power engineering consulting group co ltd (cpecc). jaks holds a 30% stake in the joint venture and cpecc the remaining 70%. in a jan 4 note, ng raised his target price for jaks to rm2 (from rm1.60) following a review of its assets after the company said it was realigning its focus on vietnam given the slowdown in the property market in malaysia. at the time, jaks share price was at rm1.01. it took barely three months to jump 70% to reach rm1.72 on april 5 before retracing. following the strong rally, ng downgraded his call to hold on may 25 when the price was rm1.58. when it skidded to rm1.38 on oct 17, however, he saw reason to upgrade to buy again with rm1.75 target price. jaks closed at rm1.50 as at dec 20, up 48.5% from the time ng reiterated his buy call with a higher target price. a special mention goes to affins lim yee tang, who initiated coverage on jaks before he moved to equity sales. ng assumed coverage from november 2016.  \nkenanga researchs raymond choos call on hartalega holdings bhd at the start of 2017, kenanga investment researchs raymond choo boldly recommended that clients buy hartalega holdings shares. he was the only one of 20 analysts tracking the stock to do so, according to bloomberg data. in fact, there was as many as five sell calls. the lack of enthusiasm may have stemmed from the fact that hartalega shares were down 17% year on year in 2016 after gaining 72% y-o-y in 2015. a long-time favourite of investors, the leading nitrile glove maker sprang a surprise rebound this year, rising more than120%. the stock moved from rm4.76 as at end-2016 to rm9.75 on dec 15, our award evaluation cut-off date. as at dec 20, the stock price reached rm11.40! investors who bought shares early this year would have choo to thank. his contrarian stance stemmed from the conviction that hartalega was capitalising on its new capacity from the ngc plant in sepang on the back of robust demand and a slower-than-expected production ramp-up in the other rubber glove players. he was convinced by hartalegas constant desire to move up the value chain by offering superior product innovation and automating its production processes. hartalegas recently announced first non-leaching antimicrobial nitrile examination glove is also expected to be a game changer in the rubber glove industry. inter-pacific securities david lai yoon hui also deserves a notable mention for also having a buy for the most part, save for a blip in may.  \nmidf researchs ng bei shans call on superlon holdings bhd at its peak, superlon holdings bhds market capitalisation reached rm463.7 million when its share price rose to rm2.92 on sept 18. while some institutional investors may consider this small, the market cap is already more than double the rm202.47 million the company was valued at on nov 22 last year  the day midf researchs ng bei shan initiated coverage on the maker of synthetic rubber insulators used mainly for heating, ventilation, air conditioning (hvac) and refrigeration  which are important for high-rise buildings and industrial use. the recommendation was based on the prospects for its new warehouse, which would improve lead time and sales; market dominance; and its sturdy balance sheet (rm39.13 million net cash) that spelt dividend payments. in fact, midf had been watching superlon for some months, starting with a non-rated report in march 2016, when its market cap stood at rm159.6 million. measured from nov 21, 2016, the share price appreciated as much as 137% to reach rm2.92 on sept 11 this year. part of the gains were thanks to a share split that the company had hoped would improve liquidity  a move that was rewarded with the entry of institutional investors, including the emergence of kumpulan wang persaraan (diperbadankan) as a substantial shareholder with a 10.49% stake. closing at rm2.15 on dec 15, the counter had skidded 26% from its recent peak but it remains about 75% above the time midf started calling a buy. ng, who had downgraded the stock to neutral on sept 27, when her target price was nearly met and its 1qfy2018 earnings were hit by a spike in raw material price, upgraded her call again to buy on dec 15 following the share price weakness. at the time of writing, its rm2.36 target price implies 9.8% upside potential from current levels.  \naffin hwang capital researchs tan jian yuans call on serba dinamik holdings bhd if you had bought serba dinamik holdings bhd shares when affin hwang researchs tan jian yuan started coverage with a buy and rm2.40 target price, you would have seen your holdings rise 67.7% over seven months from rm1.76 to rm3.22 on dec 15. thats if you did not get the initial public offering (ipo) shares for serba dinamik, which made a strong debut on the main market on feb 8 this year and went on to become the years best-performing ipo with a gain of 119% as at dec 15. kenanga investment bank was the ipo lead manager. when tan started tracking serba dinamik about two months from its debut, the stock price had already appreciated 10% from its ipo price. yet he was convinced that there was at least 45% more upside potential  and was proved right. at the time, tan was upbeat on its growth potential, expecting strong maintenance activity growth and expansion of engineering, procurement, construction and contracting (epcc) revenue to drive forward earnings. he also expected the group to pay out 25% to 30% of net profits in fy2017 to fy2019, translating into decent yields of3.3% to 5.2%, the initiation report read. a notable mention goes to rhb research institutes wan mohd zahidi, who initiated coverage on may 8 with a rm2.78 target price when the stock price was at rm1.92, as well as alliance dbs researchs inani rozidin, who initiated coverage on may 16 this year with a rm2.90 target price when the stock was at rm2. investors would also have made good money following their recommendations, despite the later initiation dates. at the time of writing, tans rm4 target price shows that he remains among the most bullish of all seven analysts calling a buy while rhbs is the lowest at rm3.10 "}, "15": {"date_posted": "27/12/2017", "title": "fbm klci up 11.77pts at intraday

oil & gas conundrum", "article": " malaysia-based oil and gas outfit de raj group ag has just received the requisite approvals for a listing on the frankfurt stock exchange in germany. when asked why the company opted for a listing so far from home, ceo vaidyanthan nateshan says things are difficult in malaysia, referring particularly to the debt market. its not the equity market that is tough, its the debt market. we are well capitalised and need financing for executing projects. the malaysian debt market is dead u2026 asset cover here is 2.5 to 3 times while in europe, it is 0.8 times, he tells the edge in a short phone conversation last friday. we have bankers telling us they wont touch oil and gas companies with a barge pole, so im taking the company to europe. one of de raj groups shareholders, nagendran nadarajah, is certainly familiar with the local capital market. the businessman had owned perisai petroleum teknologi bhd years ago and had listed it.  more jobs but no financing last month, tan sri mokhzani mahathir, a long-time investor in oil and gas, sold out of sapura energy bhd. last year, he exited yinson holdings bhd. reports have it that he does not see the oil and gas industry turning around any time soon and would rather invest in other industries. in october, amir hamzah azizan decided to leave offshore service provider icon offshore bhd for khazanah nasional bhds themed attractions resorts & hotel sdn bhd. why amir left is anyones guess but after 27 years in the oil and gas industry, his departure raises questions. dialog group bhd executive chairman tan sri ngau boon keat, the first local engineer in petroliam nasional bhd, explains that with the decline in upstream projects and investments, banks will have to focus on good projects and businesses that have sound fundamentals and satisfy the risk criteria. dialog has not had any issues with financing, according to him. a spokesperson for dayang enterprise solutions bhd sums it up when he says, the last three years were the most difficult and challenging times that we have ever experienced over the entire 37 years since our inception in 1980. this could explain the cautious stand taken by the banks and financial institutions. deleum bhd ceo nan yusri nan rahimy acknowledges that the banks have been more cautious in their lending to the oil and gas sector in recent years. meanwhile, datuk kamarul redzuan muhamad, ceo and managing director of uzma bhd, opines that it appears to be more difficult for oil and gas companies to get financing nowadays compared with when crude oil prices were above us$100 per barrel. this could be because there is no indication of where the industry is going, he tells the edge. kamarul adds that the amount of work coming on stream now is considerably more than what was available two years ago, which might raise hopes of less harsh treatment by banks. singapore banks are said to be less stringent with their clients than their malaysian counterparts, which, it seems, is after some intervention by the singapore government, although this cannot be proved. at home, some oil and gas sources say the economic planning unit (epu) in the prime ministers department, which is headed by datuk abdul rahman dahlan; the malaysia petroleum resources corporation (mprc), the industry development agency under the prime ministers department; and petronas are looking at assisting local players with their banking requirements. unfortunately, messages and calls to abdul rahman went unanswered. while details are scarce, one source says the requisite data will be available with the mprc 100, which is a ranking of the top publicly traded and privately held oil and gas services and equipment (ogse) companies. mprc 100 is released either at the end of the year or in march. with the release of the mprc 100, the data on how well or badly the companies are doing will be available. from what we know, its pretty bad u2026 then, they (mprc, epu and petronas) can act on it, an industry player says.  not the same fate for all but then, not all the companies seem to be facing difficulty in obtaining financing from the banks. barakah offshore petroleum bhd president and ceo nik hamdan daud says, our bankers have been supportive in the last three years (when oil prices came tumbling down). working capital lines have always been made available to our projects. we also get good support from our bankers on our vessel loans. (we have) deferred principal repayment for two years until 2019 amid the current low market demand for offshore vessels. barakahs annual report reveals that the companys principal bankers are malayan banking bhd, export-import bank of malaysia bhd, affin bank bhd and ambank (m) bhd. the largest shareholders of barakah are nik hamdan, with 38.9% equity interest, sarawak-based samling group with a 13.6% stake and felda investment corp sdn bhd with an 8.91% stake. similarly, a spokesperson for dayang enterprise holdings bhd says banks are still supportive and lending, albeit only when supported by contracts in hand. we must add that local banks have had better appetite than foreign banks in the last few years ... foreign banks are putting on the brakes, tightening the bolts and nuts and this invariably is not helping the industry during this crucial time. for an asset-intensive industry, certain categories of assets, like vessels, would have their valuations greatly reduced and breaches of loan covenants would become common and it is in these areas that it is only fair that bankers give their indulgence, he says. dayangs largest shareholders are sarawak-based naim holdings bhd, with a 29.06% stake, the ling family (25.25%) and tengku yusof tengku ahmad shahruddin (7.52%). barakah and dayang do not have the epf or pnb as shareholders. not exactly strong parentage to warrant such treatment from the banks, a fund manager says.  petronas activity outlook even the petronas activity outlook 2018-2020, which was released earlier in the month and made public for the first time, has many functions. other than to keep the oil and gas players aware of the jobs being offered, it also highlights to the financial institutions the availability of jobs on the local front, helping to allay whatever fears they may have (see story on page 72). dialogs ngau, through an email, tells the edge, petronas is a seasoned and professional integrated oil and gas company that has lived through the cyclical variations of the industry in the past. this report demonstrates that it has a sound grasp of the current and medium-term environment and a robust plan to progress successfully in this uncertain climate. its continued investment and careful management of upstream and downstream segments provide direction and opportunity for malaysian companies and foreign investment. when asked what he thought of the activity outlook, ngau says, it has particularly highlighted the current investment at the pengerang integrated complex (pic) and the opportunity for continued development of pengerang into a regional downstream oil and gas hub, which will spur the growth of malaysias oil and gas downstream sector, propelling the country into a new frontier of technology and economic development. the pic is also expected to capitalise on the growing need for petrochemical products in asia for the next 20 years. barakahs nik hamdan says of the activity outlook, it is quite positive. several significant contracts are under bidding now, which shows its commitment to roll out more projects. barakah recently signed a consortium agreement with samling energy sdn bhd and brooke dockyard and engineering works corp to jointly bid for oil and gas-related projects in sarawak. samling energy and brooke dockyard are sarawak-based companies while samling group has a 13.5% stake in barakah. from deleums perspective, the petronas activity outlook outlines the activities. its quite straightforward but these are proposed activity plans; we have to see them rolled out and implemented, says nan yusri. what is not clear are the factors that govern it. if the price of oil changes, petronas will reassess the situation. we have to monitor the factors that govern the plan, he says in a brief conversation with the edge.  deleum has been in the news lately in october, deleum, via its 60% unit deleum primera sdn bhd, was awarded a maintenance, construction and modification contract for gas structures in peninsular malaysia by petronas carigali sdn bhd. this could be worth anywhere between rm750 million and rm1 billion. nevertheless, the margins for these jobs seem tight, largely because of competition. petronas has some 3,900 companies registered as its contractors. norway, which has a similarly sized oil and gas industry, has a mere 700 companies. this has resulted in a call for consolidation within the industry. uzmas kamarul says, it means that people have to work better and people have to have better capabilities. like it or not, what will happen is the natural attrition of those who are not capable. petronas is ensuring this happens by bringing the bigger contracts; people will say smaller companies are being sidelined, but you need this kind of thing u2026 this is the right time to do it. thus far, the only recent attempt at consolidation was a plan to merge permodalan nasional bhd-controlled umw oil & gas corp bhd with ekuity nasional bhds icon offshore bhd and orkim sdn bhd, but the deal fell through. other than the above, the only sizeable merger was when dayang made a general offer for perdana petroleum bhd in 2015  just after oil prices crashed. the dayang spokesperson reminisces on the trials and tribulations after the huge rm1.16 billion takeover offer for perdana. we quickly reverted to consolidation mode and essentially looked at ways of curtailing costs to sustain the onslaught of rate cuts and discounts. it is a survival of the fittest game as well as a time to demonstrate who can sustain longer and better. for us, we truly adhere to the fact that when the going gets tough, the tough get going. it is true grit and determination that has got us through this far, coupled with the fact that our clients and shareholders were understanding and supportive of our measures. we believe we may have seen the worst and the worst is over! he says.

posted a 94% year-on-year jump in net profit to rm6.313 million in the quarter ended sept 30. revenue surged 42% y-o-y to rm242.62 million. against this backdrop, the groups share price closed at 97.5 sen last friday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm265.2 million. but some may argue that the regional petrochemical distributor could be worth much more. our investments abroad are finally starting to mature ... indonesia and vietnam. this year, we are comfortably on target to generate rm900 million in turnover. next year? we should be able to exceed rm1 billion in turnover, says founder and executive chairman ng thin poh. for the nine months ended sept 30, the group booked rm14.7 million in net profit on revenue of rm676.18 million, up 28% and 40% y-o-y respectively. assuming the group maintains its third-quarter performance, it should easily be able to hit ngs targets. our revenue has been driven by increased demand across the board. we are highly diversified and not reliant on any one product or client. growth has been driven by new customers and increased demand from existing ones, explains ng. so, what does samchem do? it may be easy to simplify samchems business as a regional petrochemical distributor. in a nutshell, it procures, warehouses and distributes various petrochemical products. but a closer look reveals that the group has positioned itself as an integral part of the broader manufacturing supply chain. our principals are the top petrochemical companies in the world like petronas chemicals from malaysia, shell chemicals from the netherlands, exxonmobil from the us and basf from germany, says ng. along with other principals, we are able to supply over 500 different types of chemicals that are crucial for manufacturing. and across the region, we service over 6,000 customers. from paints and automotive lubricants to mattresses, samchem is able to source most raw inputs. in short, if a manufacturing process requires chemicals, samchem can supply it. the only area we are currently not involved in is food processing and edible products, says ng. the range of products is not samchems only strength. it would not be fair to peg it as a mere chemical trader  a company that simply buys and sells. it is not easy to secure distributorship rights from our principals. they put us through stringent checks, like health and safety, says ng. on top of meeting the strict requirements, the group has also invested in physical infrastructure that gives its distribution network a sizeable reach in the region. it currently operates out of malaysia, singapore, indonesia, vietnam and cambodia. looking ahead, ng plans to expand into myanmar and the philippines, positioning the company as one of the major chemical distributors in asean. when we look at malaysia alone, there is a limit to how much we can grow. to continue growing, we must expand abroad. we have strong support from our principals to expand abroad. they like working with us and want to work together to expand into these countries, explains ng. however, it has not been an easy journey. samchem ventured into vietnam in 2006 and into indonesia in 2010. expansion into both countries were fraught with challenges, says ng. we made mistakes along the way, but we also learnt from them. now, when we look to venture into the philippines and myanmar, we know how to plan accordingly, he says. the cost of the ventures is reflected in the groups lacklustre earnings in the last few years. the fall in crude oil prices in 2015 did not help either. but having weathered the difficult initial phase of the ventures abroad, samchem is starting to reap the fruits. today, samchem is one of only three major petrochemical distributors in both indonesia and vietnam. for the third quarter, its indonesian revenue rose 43% y-o-y to rm32.88 million, although profit before tax halved to rm540,000. meanwhile, its vietnamese operations saw revenue rise 65% y-o-y to rm75.38 million, driving profit up 25% to rm3.39 million. samchem wholly owns the indonesian operations and has a 63% stake in the vietnamese business. a quick look at samchems balance sheet reveals rm48.4 million in cash against rm164.3 million in debt, giving it a net gearing of 0.885 times. however, this may not truly reflect the groups gearing. over 98% of its debt is short term, used as working capital to facilitate inventory stocking. almost all of our debt is for trade financing. we need to ensure that we have enough stock on hand to meet our clients needs. some of these products take a month or two to be delivered, and our customers cant wait so long, explains ng. in fact, he says, the group currently has no plans to make a cash call despite the expansion plans. some funds have approached us, but we are not considering a private placement at this time, says ng. we should be able to fund our capital expenditure plans with internally generated funds now that our vietnamese and indonesian operations are performing. there is, however, one caveat. ng is actively looking for merger and acquisition (m&a) opportunities. and if the right opportunity presents itself, the group may raise funds for it. i believe the industry is ripe for consolidation. the smaller players are slowly losing competitiveness. and there will be opportunities for us to acquire the business; not the company, the business, says ng. on m&a, he says, i have been approached to sell the company before. but i can tell you, i have absolutely no intention to sell. i want to continue growing this business that i have built over the past 28 years. on a separate note, samchem is expanding its footprint in malaysia. it has acquired a piece of land in westports and is building a new facility that will become its new headquarters. including land cost of rm12 million, the facility is expected to cost rm30 million. the company can easily fund the expansion by disposing of its current headquarters in shah alam, selangor, says ng. he estimates that the capex for the vietnam and indonesia operations will be relatively small  about us$500,000 (rm2.08 million) for vietnam and us$500,000 to us$800,000 for indonesia  and unlikely to disrupt dividend payouts. now, we have operations in jakarta, surabaya and medan. we plan to expand to kalimantan ... pontianak, he adds. for investors eager to take a position in samchem, however, there is one hurdle that even the fund managers are facing  liquidity. the stock appears to be tightly held, making it difficult to acquire. the groups average daily trading volume is around 733,000 shares. for fund managers at least, a private placement may be the most realistic way to pick up a meaningful position.

after the meltdown of crude prices in late 2014, beat estimates with its first-ever profitable quarter in two years in the third quarter ended sept 30, 2017. the performance brought fresh optimism about earnings recovery for other upstream players. but is the long wait finally over? analysts are still sceptical, with no consistent work order flow in the local upstream segment with national oil firm petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) sticking to upstream capital expenditure (capex) cuts. the sector is at the crossroads. it looks like the recovery has started, but how strong and rapid will it be is what matters, inter-pacific securities sdn bhd head of research pong teng siew told the edge financial daily. until there is a definitive rise in work order flow or upstream capital expenditure by petronas, profitability of upstream players operating locally will remain subdued, pong said. while a rise in capex is uncertain, umw-og did see the utilisation rate of its seven rigs increase to around 90% in the quarter under review. but that was hampered by low charter rates, which barely broke even for some of its rigs, said aminvestment bank analyst alex goh. despite the stabilising of oil price to date, the sum of contract awards by value to malaysian oil and gas (o&g) players lagged in the first three quarters of 2017  it is even lower compared with the first three quarters of 2016, when oil price slumped below us$40 per barrel, meaning the worst in the sector is not over yet. the utilisation rate cannot go much higher, and there are contracts expiring in this quarter, said goh. the risk is still high  it can easily go back into losses if no new contract is secured. the company has also warned of possible impairments in this quarter. its performance does not necessarily reflect other players as they are at different stages of the value chain. but work visibility for upstream players in malaysia is just not present at the moment, goh added. uob kay hian analyst kong ho meng shared a similar view. which is why i prefer companies that are internationally competitive players like serba dinamik holdings bhd, said kong. but that, too, is not always the case  kong also cited sapura energy bhd, which is a reputable international upstream contractor. for its six-month period ended july 31, 2017 (1hfy18), the diversified o&g groups net profit contracted 74.6% to rm56.46 million, from rm222.58 million, while revenue declined 5.28% to rm3.43 billion from rm3.62 billion in 1hfy17. in this case, its earnings are still in a downgrade cycle due to declining rig utilisation and a significant gap in order book replenishment of about rm3 billion, he said. the same applies even after discounting the one-off financial impact from the cessation of the berantai risk service contract, which cost sapura energy rm52.76 million in the second quarter of financial year 2018. kong dismissed the recovering trend of oil price as a significant factor presently, amid the long gestation period before oil majors will again roll out capex, and subsequently, jobs. for now, investors money may be better off in other sectors. analysts agree that o&g valuations are treading an all-time low  a fact that has prompted some to wonder if it can be taken advantage of. definitely not for quick gains, said inter-pacifics pong. relative to the earnings of counters with low valuation, it is still not enough to excite any significant trading opportunities. you need to be very, very patient. meanwhile, uobs kong advised investors to stick to earnings-based valuation when making investment decisions. in the upstream segment, the research house has a buy call on floating production storage and offloading (fpso) player bumi armada bhd for its international exposure, and ahead of its earnings rerating upon the execution of two fpsos, kraken and olomendo, by the first quarter of 2018. we also like petronas dagangan bhd for its defensive nature in the low oil price environment, said kong. aminvestments goh opined that a fruitful opec meeting tomorrow to extend output cuts will help support oil prices at current levels, which may in turn strengthen the sentiment of sectoral recovery and upstream investment decisions by oil majors. but petronas has already indicated its intention to spend more downstream, not upstream, said goh. on that note, the house is sticking to yinson holdings bhd for its visible revenue generating contracts, and dialog group bhd amid the promising downstream prospects moving forward."}, "32": {"date_posted": "15/11/2017",

or even a special dividend, given its sterling financial performance in the third financial quarter ended sep 30, 2017 (3qfy17). cimb research noted that over the past seven years, petdags dividend payout ratio has never been lower than 75%, even though its official policy is 50%. assuming [a] 75% payout on a record fy17 forecast (fy17f) net profit  aided by rm434 million in gains from the disposal of its philippine and vietnam businesses  we are expecting rm1.18 in dividend per share (dps) for fy17f, of which only 28 sen has been paid to date. the 3qfy17 dps of 20 sen will be paid on dec 8, while we expect another 70 sen to be paid by mid-march 2018, or 3% yield over the next half year, which should drive the stock price, the firm said in a note yesterday. cimb also upgraded its call on petdag from hold to add, with a target price (tp) of rm24.41, to take advantage of its 11% share price decline over the past month, in addition to a 90 sen in expected dps over the next six

million. in vietnam, the group sold its interest in thang long lpg company ltd to noi thuong bac joint stock company, which resulted in a rm6.2 million disposal gain. midf research thinks a special dividend may be in store for petdag shareholders, given the total rm430.8 million disposal gains recorded, and as petdags cash climbed to rm3.48 billion from rm2.57 billion in 2qfy17. the firm, in a note yesterday, maintained its buy call on petdag, with an unchanged tp of rm28 per share, premised on fy18 forecast price earnings of 28 times, pegged at a forecast fy18 earnings per share of 100.1

disposal gains. revenue climbed 22.1% y-o-y to rm6.69 billion from rm5.48 billion, driven by a 3% rise in sales volume and an 18% rise in average selling price, in tandem with higher average mean of

things have not exactly been going well at thhe. it managed to obtain an extension of three months from aug 23  a second extension  for its creditors scheme. this means that it has about a month to come up with a plan or some form of compromise with its creditors. for the first half of fy2017 ended june, thhe suffered a net loss of rm37.97 million from only rm4.63 million in revenue. as at end-june, the company had rm22.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. however, it had short-term debt commitments of rm295.1 million and long-term borrowings amounting to rm55.12 million with accumulated losses of rm532.64 million. much of its revival hinges on the fpso. fabrication contracts were too lumpy and the fpso was acquired to provide a steady stream of income for thhe, but that hasnt quite panned out as planned, the oil and gas industry source says. thhe acquired the fpso, deep producer 1, (formerly the 68,000dwt tanker mv laurita) in july 2011, at a cost of us$82.5 million, which was about 40% of the us$200 million the previous owners spent building the vessel. however, the fpso was acquired without a locked-in charter contract and burnt in the region of rm2 million a month. the fpso bagged a us$900 million contract from jx nippon oil & gas exploration only in may of 2014, and it was slated to be deployed at the layang oil and gas field, located in block sk10 off sarawak. however, the conversion cost was some us$230 million, or rm875 million back then. the fpso was to have been ready last year, but thhe managed to get an extension for another two years  until 2018  after which the fpso was to be leased to jx nippon until november 2023, with an option to extend the lease up to october 2033, annually. at calculations and exchange rates back then, the jx nippon contract was to provide thhe recurring income of about rm70 million. but with talk of the fpso being sold, its revenue stream seems less clear. worse still, its debts are mounting. the company has a rm240 million sukuk facility, which is secured via a mortgage on the fpso and the long-term leasehold land and buildings, and is pegged with a coupon rate of 7% per annum. some rm170 million of the sukuk facility was to be repaid via bullet repayments in september last year, which was also the maturity date, but thhe managed to obtain a one-year extension for the repayment, that is from september 2016 till september 2017, as the company announced that it was in the midst of finalising a scheme with its creditors, including the sukuk holders.  pilgrim fund unlikely to pump more money into thhe thhes 29.81% shareholder, pilgrim fund lembaga tabung haji (lth), was the sole subscriber for thhes cash call  islamic irredeemable convertible preference shares (icps)  in 2015. to recap, thhe had issued 1.19 billion renounceable rights issue of new islamic icps of 25 sen par value at an issue price of 25 sen on the basis of 16 icps for every 15 shares held in thhe, with a tenure of five years. lth subscribed for 99.75% of the 1.1 billion icps offered and raised rm275 million for thhe. this means that lth will control 64.57% of the company if the preference shares are converted. the preference shares can be converted at any time within the five-year tenure. considering lth is sitting on a huge loss with thhe, it is unlikely more money will be pumped in. lth got into this position when it bought into ramunia holdings bhd, the previous incarnation of thhe, in 2008. to recap, early that year, misc bhd proposed to inject its oil and gas unit, malaysia machine and heavy engineering sdn bhd, into fabricator ramunia in a reverse takeover. the proposal, valued at rm3.2 billion, was called off after misc announced that there were unsatisfactory due diligence findings. lth turned out to be the biggest loser as it got stuck with almost 29.7% of ramunias stock and showed a paper loss of some rm175 million back then, having aggressively accumulated ramunia shares before the deal fell through and with ramunia shedding over 70% of its market capitalisation after misc pulled out. misc had postponed the completion of its due diligence three times before calling off the deal, which should have been indication enough that not all was well with ramunia. lth emerged as a substantial shareholder in ramunia in early november 2007, two months before the deal with misc was announced, and aggressively accumulated shares for a good one year until december 2008.

is highly diversified  from facilities management services to maintenance and operations and car park solutions. our potential in this sector is huge. this is why ifm is the linchpin of our strategic restructuring plan. we are focusing on synergising our speciality in project management consultancy and ifm in order to deliver a great value proposition to our clients, brian says in an email response to the edge. the ifm divisions subsidiaries include metro parking (m) sdn bhd, hc duraclean sdn bhd (hcd) and tmr urusharta (m) sdn bhd. apart from these three areas, drealty plans to venture into other segments of the industry, including security, cabin management, waste management and food and beverage management, says brian. the integration of our facilities management subsidiaries allowed us to become a one-stop solutions provider to our clients and has generated new opportunities for us to [enter] new business sectors under the ifm umbrella. today, we are able to provide a great value proposition to our clients, with services encompassing all related areas of facilities management  from planning and development to maintenance and operations, car park solutions and management of assets, he says. brian was appointed group ceo of drealty in september last year. he was previously the general manager of malaysia airports holdings bhds (mahb) transformation management office. at mahb, he helped to turn around its facilities management subsidiary, urusan teknologi wawasan sdn bhd, where he was ceo. the contribution from property projects varies over time, depending on progress billing and completion rate, while ifm brings in a stable recurring income. so, the strong growth in ifm will drive drealtys performance, he says. drealtys ifm division has performed significantly better than last year, with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) growing more than 30%, he says. however, drealtys accounts show that the segment, while profitable, may not have the heft to change the groups fortunes. for the six months to june 30 (1hfy2017), the ifm division recorded a profit of rm988,000, compared with rm1.88 million a year ago, despite revenue rising 20.7% to rm99.1 million. this compares with the property segments profit of rm6.05 million and the groups consolidated profit of rm4.762 million. as at june 30, drealty had a debt ratio of 0.73 times. the decrease in profit, despite higher revenue, is due to high initial operating costs, mainly manpower, drealty says in its financial statement for the second quarter of financial year 2017 (2qfy2017). we registered a lower profit in the first half of the year compared with the [previous] corresponding period due to the nature of most ifm projects. the initial cost of operations outlay during the early stages is high, along with thinner profit margins, says brian. in 1qfy2017 ended march 31, the property services and parking divisions made a combined profit of rm119,000, compared with a combined profit of rm2.27 million in the previous corresponding quarter. in 1hfy2017, the ifm divisions revenue was lifted by a 92.1% increase in contribution from engineering and maintenance services, due primarily to a contract at petronas refinery and petrochemical integrated development (rapid) in pengerang, johor. to recap, in september last year, tmr lc services sdn bhd, a 70:30 joint venture between tmr and lc catering sdn bhd, received a contract from petronas refinery and petrochemical corporation sdn bhd, for the operation and maintenance of rapids temporary executive village and temporary management office facilities and infrastructure worth rm124 million. in july this year, petronas subsidiary, prpc utilities and facilities sdn bhd, awarded a contract to provide security management services for rapid to a consortium of which tmr is a member. the contract is worth rm26.2 million and can be extended to include additional services worth rm9.77 million. last month, tmr, in a joint venture with kpj healthcare bhds kumpulan perubatan (johor) sdn bhd, was awarded a contract to manage a small medical facility in rapid for 39 months by prpc utilities and facilities for rm27.6 million. the contract includes an optional services contract worth rm7.8 million. meanwhile, in july, metro parking (s) pte ltd, 70%-owned by metro parking, received a five-year contract to operate and manage car parks at the singapore sport councils sport centres, worth rm56.6 million. tmr and hcd manage over 10 million sq ft of property and assets for clients, including the government and government-linked companies, throughout malaysia. in the coming years, ifm will provide the impetus to drealtys growth, says brian. the facilities management market in malaysia has been experiencing strong growth, driven by rapid urbanisation. from 2011 to 2015, the market grew more than 8% annually to an industry value of over rm4 billion, he says. the facilities management industry will grow more than 8% per year over the next three years, he adds. on the surface, there is huge opportunity in the country for ifm companies, due to the large number of commercial properties, healthcare facilities and infrastructure being developed. however, the type facilities management contracts the companies secure determines their profitability. apart from drealty, there are at least three other bursa malaysia-listed companies involved in the ifm industry. these include uem edgenta bhd, awc bhd and gfm services bhd. all of these companies were profitable as at end-june this year. uem edgenta is the biggest of the four. in 2qfy2017, the groups ifm segments  consisting of healthcare, infrastructure and real estate services  made a combined profit before tax (pbt) of rm48.5 million, from a combined revenue of rm469.3 million. awcs facilities division made a profit of rm14.3 million during the quarter on the back of rm135.2 million in revenue. gfm, which debuted on bursa malaysia last december, made a pbt of rm3.45 million in 2qfy2017, on rm26 million in revenue. past and current projects for drealtys property business include taman damansara aliff in johor and damansara hills in kuantan. drealty is also partnering country garden real estate sdn bhd (cgre), a unit of china-based country garden holdings company ltd, to develop an integrated township on a 53-acre tract in tebrau, johor, with a gross development value of rm3.5 billion. the project, called central park, will eventually comprise 10,000 residential units, commercial units and amenities, to be developed over several phases in six to eight years. phase 1 of the project was launched in march. according to brian, the construction of phase 1 is ongoing and on schedule. the project, in which drealty owns a 30% stake in the joint venture with cgre, is expected to start contributing to the groups earnings next year, he says. our priority is to identify those projects that improve our margins and contribute to our cash flow and bottom line. in tandem, we are expanding our project management and consultancy capability to

the short term", "article": " kuala lumpur: oil and gas (o&g) companies had a good run-up in their stock prices early last week, as global benchmark brent crude price hit its highest level since july 2015, taking cue from rising global demand, production halt in the us and potential supply issues as turkey threatened to cut off the pipeline that carries oil from northern iraq to the outside world. brent price rose to us$59 (rm248.98) per barrel last monday, but slipped to us$57.58 per barrel last friday, although still far off its 10-month low of us$44 per barrel in june. a possibility that the opec could extend production cuts at its next meeting on nov 30 has helped maintain oil price at the current level. analysts are expecting oil price to average us$50 per barrel in 2017. given the recent run-up in share prices, most analysts are of the view that the o&g stocks have limited upside potential. they believe selective purchases of o&g stocks are probably the best stance to take at this juncture. a consensus view is that companies with stable earnings and low reliance on oil producers capital expenditure (capex) are likely to be the best bets. these include companies in the midstream energy sector such as floating production storage and offloading players. downstream engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning companies, as well as petrochemical and retail companies, are also expected to thrive in a low-oil-price environment. according to aminvestment bank equity research analyst alex goh, more investments are being done in the downstream o&g subsegment, developing petrochemical refineries and tanks. the development of the us$27 billion pengerang integrated petroleum complex (pipc) in johor is seen as the catalyst for the downstream subsegment, while petroliam nasional bhds (petronas) roll-out of maintenance, construction and modification (mcm) contracts for its facilities at pipc in the third quarter of 2017 was a catalyst for the upstream o&g subsegment. however, goh opined that the pipc will only benefit select o&g players, at least in the short to medium term. over time, the projects can witness a critical mass that will benefit other companies not directly involved right now, he told the edge financial daily. but at this juncture, it is not incremental to the sector as a whole, he added. goh likes dialog group bhd even though the stock is trading at a 2018 forward price-earnings ratio (per) of 26 times, below its five-year peak of 29 times. we view the premium as justified given dialogs long-term recurring cash flow-generating businesses, which are largely cushioned from volatile crude oil price cycles, and further underpinned by the pengerang developments multi-year value expansion, he said in a report dated aug 16. he also has a buy rating on yinson holdings bhd, noting that the stock currently trades at a bargain 2018 forward per of 12 times versus over 20 times for dialog and sapura energy bhd. affin hwang investment bank analyst tan jianyuan concurred, noting that the market is in a rebalancing stage of supply and demand, with o&g companies seeing their revenue grow in the first half of 2017 amid more jobs being dished out albeit at a slow pace. while contract flows this year are tracking to surpass 2016 levels, we believe they are still rather lacklustre. besides that, service providers in the o&g sector continue to see their earnings lag behind their valuations, making them not appealing, apart from a select few names, he said. tans top picks are bumi armada bhd, petronas chemicals group bhd and serba dinamik holdings bhd. he expects brent price to be in a range of us$50 to us$55 per barrel in 2017 and us$55 to us$60 per barrel in 2018. meanwhile, analysts note that o&g players in the upstream subsegment continued to face pressure as seen in their earnings, which did not improve much in the second quarter of 2017. apart from a select few, asset-heavy companies in the upstream o&g subsegment such as sapura energy still suffer from low utilisation, low charter rates and unexciting realised oil price, they added. in a report last friday, midf research said despite the comparatively stronger global crude oil price, activity level in the offshore o&g sphere was still subdued. due to the persistent struggle in global crude oil price to make meaningful upside recovery, relatively low upstream activities and charter rates stress on offshore heavy assets, we are maintaining our negative stance on the upstream o&g subsegment, the research firm said. affin hwangs tan downgraded sapura energy to sell from hold as the company reported a lower core net profit year-on-year in the second quarter ended july 31, 2017, dragged down by weaker drilling and exploration and production divisions. we believe that the recent share price performance is not reflective of its current fundamentals (trading at a forward 60 times financial year 2018 per), but rather of sentiment, he said in a note dated sept 28. tan believes the share price and earnings of other o&g stocks have also yet to bottom out. counters deemed as trading at a premium by him include petra energy bhd and malaysia marine and heavy engineering holdings bhd, he said in a separate report dated sept 19. citing cash flow deterioration for 14 listed companies with o&g exposure in the second quarter of 2017, tan is maintaining a neutral call on the overall sector as valuations continue to trade at a premium of 31 times forward per. goh, meanwhile, pointed out that fabricators, offshore engineering and construction service companies and offshore support vessel operators are still waiting for oil price recovery  and subsequently capex spending of oil majors  before any lucrative contracts can come in. he has a hold rating on bumi armada and sapura energy. petronas, for example, reportedly said it would allocate rm60 billion for capex in 2017, up 17% from a year ago  but the bulk of it goes to downstream projects as part of its effort to future-proofing its overall portfolio, a decision it said is also being undertaken by competitors. an analyst with a local investment bank opined that the rm6 billion worth of mcm roll-out, which is a continuation of existing service contracts, will not be as impactful as anticipated. the figure looks large, but i doubt the value will be meaningful. the contracts, which are split over five years, will be further divided into smaller sizes to be awarded to many different players, he said. uob kay hian senior analyst kong ho meng is maintaining a market weight call on the o&g sector. we maintain our sector theme of setting take-profit levels if stock valuation is not supported by earnings rerating."}, "47": {"date_posted": "27/9/2017", "title": "selldown in equities a buying opportunity", "article": " kuala lumpur: the recent declines in local equities along with the global markets amid escalating tensions between north korea and the us are seen by market analysts as a buying opportunity. the fbm klci has been on a downtrend since mid-september and slipped 3.55 points yesterday to close at 1,765.59 points. i think its a knee-jerk reaction from the market following the heightened tension between the us and north korea. i think the selldown is a buying opportunity for investors, rakuten trade sdn bhd vice-president vincent lau told the edge financial daily over the telephone. north korea foreign minister ri yong-ho said on monday in new york that us president donald trump had declared war on north korea and that pyongyang reserves the right to take countermeasures. since the us declared war on our country, we will have every right to make all self-defensive countermeasures, including the right to shoot down us strategic bombers at any time even when they are not yet inside the aerospace border of our country, ri said. the comments made by ri were in reference to trumps tweets on saturday saying that he and north korean leader kim jong-un wont be around much longer if they acted on their threats. white house press secretary sarah sanders has responded to ris comments by saying that the accusation that a declaration of war is made by the us is absurd. according to lau, despite the exchange of words between the two countries, there are about four to five other ways that the north korean crisis could be resolved according to most reports and going to war is still not the base case scenario at the moment. lau also pointed out that despite the decline seen in the technology (tech) and semiconductor sectors, there is still room to grow. however, he agreed that there are those who have jumped on the bandwagon of the oil and gas (o&g) sector as they switched from tech and semiconductor companies, taking profit after a good run in their share prices this year. with the recovery seen in the oil price, the momentum in the o&g counters is good and should be sustained. while there are those who have taken profit and rotated from the semiconductor and tech players to o&g, i think the tech counters still have legs to go. this recent selldown seen in the tech counters in the us is more of a correction, he added. besides the oil price rally that saw crude oil prices rise past us$59 (rm248.18) a barrel, lau said that expectations of awards of maintenance, construction and modification (mcm) contracts by petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) to o&g support service providers also provided the catalyst for the run-up among o&g counters. o&g counters including hibiscus petroleum bhd, sumatec resources bhd and umw oil & gas corp bhd dominated bursa malaysias most active list yesterday. hibiscus gained 5.6% to 66.5 sen with 206.1 million shares traded, sumatec was unchanged at six sen with 62.3 million shares traded, and umw o&g fell 7.4% to 31.5 sen with 93.9 million shares traded. hibiscus, umw o&g and sumatec were bursa malaysias second, fourth and ninth most active stocks respectively. affin hwang investment bank analyst tan jianyuan said the momentum seen in the o&g counters was a result of strong news flow rather than fundamental improvements. its more of the second liners or cheaper stocks that are seeing these gains even though fundamentally, they are still suffering. crude oil prices rose past us$59 a barrel, its highest level in two years, before moderating to us$58.66 at the time of writing, supported by turkeys threat to cut crude flows from iraqs kurdistan region to the outside world. affin hwang asset management portfolio manager khoo hsien liang said despite the heightened geopolitical tension, the companys investment position remains unchanged and it would look to add if there are compelling discounts or when value emerges. khoo added that while the market reacted to the north korean-us standoff, other factors were at play including germanys election results, property cooling measures in china and profit-taking in the tech sectors. markets have responded negatively, mainly as a result of knee-jerk reactions. however, its difficult to fully attribute current market weakness to just north korea as other factors were at play, he added the mscis broadest index of asia-pacific shares outside japan fell as much as 0.5% to a near three-week low and was last down 0.3% following losses on wall street. the klci fell by 0.2% or 3.55 points to 1,765.59 points, the lowest level since aug 29 when it was hovering at 1,761.14. the fbm top 100 index, the fbm mid-70 index, the fbm small cap index and the fbm ace index have all also fallen by 0.27%, 0.47%, 0.41% and 0.89% respectively. another analyst who declined to be named pointed to the recovery in the stock market towards the end of the day as a sign that the weakness seen yesterday could be temporary. we see a spontaneous reaction from the market to a scenario that is deemed as the worst- case scenario [if a war were to break out], but as the day went by and more information is digested, the market slowly rebounded from its intraday low of 1,761.21. i think if the us market were to show some signs of recovery overnight, we should see a rebound in the malaysian equity market tomorrow (today), he said. hussein sayed, chief market strategist at fxtm, agreed, saying that every aggressive sell-off in the equity market and move to safe havens on geopolitical risks have proven to be short-lived. the best-case scenario is for the us to add more pressure on china and russia, to increase sanctions against pyongyang and pressure kim jong-un to sit around a negotiation table. however, as an investor, you should keep all options on the table, he said.\n"}, "48": {"date_posted": "19/9/2017",

sustainability of the share price rally. the results are almost certainly better than what we had seen last year. the big problem is that a lot of these recoveries have been priced in. the run-up has

companies, he points out. ever since the fbm klci breached the 1,770 level, we have not been as bullish about the market and believe that investors should gradually take profit as we expect to see

goh, an analyst with hong leong investment bank, says the construction sector in general will see strong earnings results for the quarter ended march 31. in general, if you look at the contracts that have been announced on bursa malaysia, 2016 saw a record high of rm56.4 billion [domestic contracts awarded to listed contractors] and usually, the impact on profit will come in a year later for a span of three years, says goh. he adds that the momentum for the market rally hinges on the performance of corporate earnings. the stock market will be a bit jittery if earnings disappoint but if it meets expectations, the momentum will continue. of course, investors would probably still be hopeful if the first-quarter earnings were not on track as they would probably take a wait-and-see approach. but whats certain is that the numbers for the first six months will be crucial to keep the momentum going, says goh. pong concurs but believes that certain companies will perform well in the

public bank bhd was one of the first few banks to announce its first-quarter results for the financial year ending dec 31, 2017 (1qfy2017). net profit rose a marginal 1.5% to rm1.25 billion from rm1.23 billion a year ago. with the malaysian economy expected to improve moving into next year, the banking sector is likely to see better days ahead, says etiqas eng. in the first quarter of this year, the economy grew at its fastest pace in two years as gross domestic product rose 5.6%, according to bank negara malaysia. the banking sector is viewed as a support to economic growth. thus, the earnings releases of malayan banking bhd, cimb group holdings bhd, rhb bank bhd and hong leong bank bhd this week will be closely monitored. the bursa malaysia finance index has increased 13.6% year

the first quarter as well as the first half, analysts are expecting a weaker second half as a result of weaker cpo prices. on this basis, despite better earnings in the first quarter, most analysts feel that it is in line with expectations. the plantation players that will be announcing their results this week include kuala lumpur kepong bhd and sime darby bhd.  oil and gas: gradual recovery but volatile oil price a key risk an analyst with a local research house says the outlook for the oil and gas sector remains weak and he expects its earnings to remain flattish. the oil price is still volatile while the capital expenditure will take some time to come through. of course, we have seen a strong rally in some of the o&g counters but its mainly due to a sharp collapse in some of these companies in the last two years. currently, some of the shares are already back to their fair value and i wouldnt advocate chasing after them, he says. petronas dagangan bhd is one of the o&g companies that has announced its first-quarter results  it saw a 15.4% growth in net profit to rm253.2 million. most of the o&g companies that announced their results last week saw better earnings

analyst from ta securities. she says a lot of consumer players have had to raise prices due to the rising cost of commodities. with the pressure from rising inflation as well as the weaker ringgit, this has led to weak consumer sentiment. earnings are expected to be weaker or remain flattish compared with the previous years results. [with factors such as] the ringgit remaining low  the house view is at rm4.25 against the us dollar  and rising price of raw materials such as sugar due to the rationalisation of government subsidies, consumer sentiment is expected to remain weak, she explains. however, the analyst says sentiment could improve if an early general election were to translate into more goodies for the public. if that happens, consumer sentiment could improve and this would probably stimulate spending, she adds. there are other consumer players that are doing well, such as the poultry players and convenience stores, according to an analyst from a local research house.  logistics: long-term growth story logistics players are not likely to see excitement from their earnings announcements in the coming week, say analysts. quarter on quarter, we think that there will be a slight decline but overall, it should be flattish results for the logistics players. i think that for them, it will be more of a long-term growth story, driven by the e-commerce boom. but in the near term, were not going to see much excitement, says hong leong investment bank analyst lim sin kiat.

forecasts and a fv of 80 sen per share, based on its book value at a 20% discount on the cost of the groups rigs. we note that umw-ogs share price has risen by 12% since our recommendation upgrade last week. umw-og has sold a 50% stake in its semi-submersible rig naga 1 to panama-incorporated jdc panama inc for us$1.7 million (rm7 million) cash via an open tender. it retains the remaining half. naga 1, which has a mitsubishi md 25-sp propulsion and rated to operate at water depths of 1,000ft (305m), was acquired by the umw group in 2005. the rig had a 14-year charter with petronas carigali sdn bhd until august 2018. however, the contract was discontinued last year due to an absence of requirements for this rig class and age. idle since the third quarter of financial year 2016, we are neutral on the groups decision to dispose of naga 1 to reduce its maintenance costs and operating capital expenditure. built in 1974, the rig was upgraded in 2012. however, based on naga 1s original investment of us$17 million, we estimate a net book value of us$7 million assuming a straight-line depreciation over 20 years. as the group may have made some provisions for the diminution in value of its rig assets last year, we do not expect umw-og to register any significant losses from this sale. as the rig itself is not operational currently and hence would not result in additional minority charges from the sale, we expect a marginal reduction in umw-ogs interest costs. with a fleet utilisation that can only reach 50% at best with significantly lower new charter rates, the groups losses and negative cash flow are unlikely to abate in the medium term. hence, the stock currently trades at 35% of its latest book value of rm1.04 per share, which could be eroded by further losses and asset impairments. nevertheless, we are positive on the possibility that umw-ogs proposed rm1.8 billion rights issue with detachable rights may be cut by 60% to rm700 million if the merger is aborted, which will have a significantly lower dilution to shareholders.  aminvestment bank, may 2"}, "64": {"date_posted": "19/4/2017", "title": "mhbs fy18 earnings seen higher on new project", "article": "

with a positive global growth story and anticipation of better corporate earnings, driven by recovery in commodity prices. it is no wonder the fbm klci has gained some upward momentum, up 6.3% year to date (ytd) to 1,745.20 points while the broader market fbm emas index has climbed 7.63% ytd to 12,341.34. but the renewed pressure on the crude oil prices is raising concerns about whether the positive sentiment would be sustainable. pong teng siew, head of research with inter-pacific securities sdn bhd, cautioned that the recovery in american drilling for oil could drive crude oil prices lower and change the expectation on earnings growth moving forward. according to him, earnings outlook has been better at the moment against the backdrop of higher and stabilise crude oil and palm oil prices. he, however, was not convinced that the oil prices would stay at the current level. a reversal could change expectations about earnings growth. i think there is a danger that the market is pricing in a lot of positive factors despite the uncertainties that remain. i have my doubt if the oil will be as bullish as some people are expecting. theres a strong production pickup in the oil market especially in the us. unless demand picks up strongly, it will be difficult for the momentum of the oil price to continue, pong commented. he added that global growth has also relied heavily on china in the past few years and that the market has yet to make sense of what chinas economy might look like over the next few years. he shared that while growth in the us could pick up, the shale oil production has also expanded rapidly, a counterweight to the effect from stronger demand in the us. under these circumstances, pong shared that the market will eventually have to be realistic about the oil price movement. the domino effect from a weakened oil price could hurt other commodities and sectors in the country. the oil and gas players have seen a strong rally since the beginning of the year and if the oil price were to weaken, the sentiment would reverse, he said. a technical chartist shared with the edge financial daily that the fbm klci has a strong correlation with the oil price movement, with the benchmark index lagged behind the oil price movement. if you look at the collapse of the oil price back in 2014, the index has tracked the movement of the oil. similarly, when the oil staged a gradual recovery in 2016, the fbm klci tried to emulate that. the equity market was affected by other news flow and development but oil has been the main factor in the last two to three years, he said and pointed out that the index is likely to be affected by the movement of the oil price in the next few weeks. the sentiment would swing if oil price remains low or shows a declining trend. at the moment, it doesnt look that way, he added. midf amanah investment bank bhd deputy head of research mohd redza abdul rahman said that oil price is also one of the determinant of the movement of the equity market but he was more positive about its outlook. he shared that positive corporate news flow such as stabilising crude oil (brent is now hovering around us$51 [rm225.93] per barrel), which is positive for downstream o&g players such as petronas chemicals and petronas dagangan. other factors that have lent support to the local bourse include expectations of better earnings performance this year as well as a lower geopolitical risk impact from europe and the us. mohd redza expects better market sentiment ahead with higher earnings expectations, coupled with favourable operating climate. he, however, cautioned that there could be some shocks from upcoming elections in europe as well as the movement of oil prices as the opec agreement on production cut is only valid

british oilfield company petrofac ltd for two wells. umw-ogs shares rose 3.17% to 65 sen yesterday on news of the second drilling contract, but the gain is hardly significant considering that the

short term. i think it will only marginally impact its share price, an analyst told the edge financial daily. for many, concerns remain about umw-ogs restructuring plan which involves the demerger

all-time low of 63 sen on tuesday. according to analysts, the acquisition plan is burdened with pricey valuation of the two companies. even less attractive is the rights issue at 50 sen per umw-og share to raise up to rm1.8 billion, which will be used mainly for the acquisition. aminvestment bank said the acquisition is value-destructive for umw-og, with the unjustified price-to-book value of icon and orkim at 0.7 times and 3.6 times respectively. without these acquisitions, we estimate that the merged entitys much-needed recapitalisation plan could have been cut by 60%, it said. ta securities opines there is another side to the merger. umw-ogs cash flow difficulties will be alleviated by icon and orkim. furthermore, after the rights issue, the merged entitys net gearing will reduce to 0.91 times from 1.69 times currently, it said in a note. overall, restructuring will be good for the company and industry in the long run, but another bigger issue looms for the jack-up rig service provider  oversupply. the mergers will make our industry players stronger and more competitive, the analyst said. but the main concern is jobs. if there is no job in the jack-up rig charter

plants at the complex in the southern state of johor with evonik industries ag, basf se and kuokuang petrochemical technology co never materialized. rapid, announced in 2011 and originally scheduled to start last year, got a boost last month when saudi arabian oil co, the worlds biggest oil exporter, said it will invest us$7 billion. talks that led to the deal with the worlds biggest oil exporter, known as saudi aramco, started in at least 2014, sazali said. its really a tough time to find investors, especially in oil and gas because of the uncertainties of the oil situation, sazali said monday in kuala lumpur. if everyones agendas can be aligned, then it will happen. as rapids development accelerates, petronas chemicals plans to increase capital spending by as much as one-quarter this year and next from last years roughly 4 billion ringgit (us$900 million), sazali said. the company used an oil price assumption of us$50 to us$60 a barrel, when it budgeted for the project in 2015, as part of its new normal, he said. 2020 target brent crude, the global benchmark, has averaged about us$55 this year, down from almost us$100 in 2014. shares of petronas chemicals have risen 4.9% this year, matching the gain in the benchmark stock index. the increased spending will help raise production capacity of basic chemicals to 16 million tons a year by 2020, from 10.8 million tons now, with most of that coming from rapid, sazali said. \"rapid provides full integration of infrastructure and support facilities\" and also sizeable land for future expansion, sazali said. subsequent investments beyond the current rapid project would enjoy freight savings and thats one reason rapid could appeal to and attract potential investors, he said. the company also wants to expand further into derivative and specialty chemicals and is evaluating the production of ethylene, propylene and butadiene derivatives, he said. rapid will remain its focus over the next few years and the company will only actively seek overseas acquisitions next decade, sazali said. the company is targeting a utilization rate of as high as 90% for its plants this year, he said. pre-tax profits last year would have been about 20% lower, if it hadnt pushed rates to a record 96%, according to sazali."}, "74": {"date_posted": "14/3/2017", "title": "umwog losses unlikely to abate in the near

unchanged fv of 65 sen, based on book value at a 20% discount to cost of the groups rigs, together with a 30% reduction in acquisition costs of icon offshore bhd and orkim sdn bhd. our financial year 2017 (fy17) to fy19 earnings forecasts are also unchanged as the new short-term charter for the naga 2 jack-up drilling rig from petronas vestigo petroleum remains well within our utilisation assumption of 40% to 60%. as the charter is to drill only one firm well, commencing at the end of the first quarter (1q) of calendar year 2017, we expect the duration to be around one month.  recall that umwog had earlier secured a short-term charter for a minimum of 50 days for its naga 2 jack-up rig, starting in 2q17, for the marginal ophir field, terengganu, in which the joint venture partners are australiabased octanex (50%), scomi (30%) and vestigo petroleum (20%). hence, naga 2s work schedule appears to have accelerated by a month.  late last year, the group managed to secure an 18-month charter for its naga 8 jack-up rig from hess exploration and production malaysia bv to operate in the north malay basin, off peninsular malaysia. this contract, which has already commenced, is attached with an option to extend for a further 12 months.  at this stage, we understand that the other operating rig is naga 6, which is chartered to petronas carigali for two years, with an extension option for another year, while the other six rigs (including naga 1) in the fleet are warm-stacked.  as a result, there will only be two rigs in operation in 1qfy17  naga 6 and naga 8  while naga 2 will be temporarily added on charter in 2qfy17. with a fleet utilisation rate that can only reach 38% at best and impacted by significantly lower new charter rates, the groups losses and negative cash flow are unlikely to abate in the near term unless there is a significant reversal in the regional rig utilisation rate, which is currently below 40%. we maintain our view that the recently proposed acquisition (together with the demerger from umw holdings bhd) of icon offshore and orkim at unjustified prices by volume of 0.7 times and 3.6 times is value-destructive for umwog, against the backdrop of an offshore sector still struggling with operating losses.  without these acquisitions, we estimate that the merged entitys much-needed recapitalisation plan (via an rm1.8 billion renounceable rights issue at 50 sen per share, with a free detachable seven-year warrant) could have been cut by 60%. hence, the stock currently trades at 38% of its latest book value of rm1.04 per share, which could still be eroded by further losses.  aminvestment bank, march 13"}, "75": {"date_posted": "6/3/2017", "title": "petra energy strikes optimistic note despite losses ",

billion pan malaysia contract from petronas carigali sdn bhd look set to boost its performance as crude oil prices rebound. affin hwang capital research says in a u00adreport that it is expecting better margins from its bread-and-butter business  the service and marine asset segment as activities pick up. besides, some say petra energy could also be a potential beneficiary of the maintenance, construction and modification (mcm) contract from petroliam nasional bhd (petronas), which is expected to be awarded by the second u00adquarter of this year. petronas five-year mcm contracts, u00adestimated at rm5 billion to rm6 billion, will be split into six packages, says kenanga research in a u00adreport. the research house adds that the sarawak mcm portion is the largest  at rm1.5 billion. it should not come as a surprise if petra energy bags a slice of the mcm contract, given that the company has strong political ties at both the federal and state levels. its largest shareholder is sarawakian tycoon tan sri bustari yusof, who holds a 27.5% stake through shorefield resources sdn bhd. datuk mohamed nizam razak, brother of prime minister datuk seri najib razak, has 9.1%. petra energy is also said to be looking out for more risk service contracts (rsc) after its success in a joint venture with coastal energy company operating the kapal, beranang and meranti (kbm) cluster fields under the rsc. the kbm cluster is estimated to contain u00adrecoverable resources of 15 million to 35 million barrels of oil. coastal energy is an international exploration and production company with principal assets in thailand and malaysia. now, with crude oil prices rebounding and the ringgit remaining weak against the greenback, petra energy stands to gain more from its kbm rsc, which has helped the company stay cash flow positive. crude oil prices have rebounded from us$34 to us$56 per barrel within a year. meanwhile, the ringgit has depreciated 5.2% to 4.44 over the same period. according to public investment research, u00adpetra energy and its partner have been fine-tuning the management of its oil well, which resulted in some reduction in its production cost. it adds that the joint venture plans to drill more wells to enhance production, going forward. for the financial year ended dec 31, 2016, petra energy slipped into the red, recording a net loss of rm117. 28 million compared with net profit of rm47.21 million a year ago. revenue halved to rm333.24 million from rm654.78 million a year ago as fewer work orders were carried out for the hook up, commissioning and top-side major maintenance contract from petronas carigali. a large part of the net loss was attributed to the huge amount of impairments, totalling rm77.38 million, made during the financial year. according to public investment research, petra energy impaired two vessels and receivables, which accounted for 65% of the loss. while the results look unimpressive, the companys balance sheet remains intact. unlike many of its peers, petra energy is in a net cash position. it also declared a single-tiered u00adinterim dividend of two sen per share, bringing its total dividends per share to five sen for fy2016. there is more optimism over the prospects for the oil and gas industry in light of the moderate oil price recovery, although market sentiments are still cautious. the group will u00adcontinue to manage costs and increase efficiency. in addition, exploring opportunities in the energy sector shall remain a priority for the group, petra energy says in a filing last thursday. public investment research opines that petra energy is ready to undertake new jobs or to step up on existing ones, where necessary. petra energys share price has slipped 16.2% over a period of one year. it closed at 97.5 sen last friday with a market capitalisation of rm312.9 million. currently, there are two buy and one hold calls on the oil and gas counter, with u00adtarget prices ranging from 92 sen to rm1.43. affin hwang capital research, which has a buy call on the stock at the target price of rm1.25, says it likes petra energy for its net cash balance sheet and it is seen as a direct beneficiary of higher crude oil prices on the kbm rsc. public investment research, which has a hold call on the stock, sees petra energy u00adperforming better in fy2017. we do anticipate a better performance this year, with petronas having recalibrated its budget to continue its capital expenditure programme, although at a slower pace. to date, petra energy has managed to secure more work orders for its pan malaysian contracts compared with 2016, which will improve the groups performance, going forward, it says.

relief will be short-lived as uncertainty remains the buzzword in the coming year. fund managers and analysts are already expecting several world events next year that will cause more uncertainty. indisputably, incoming us president donald trumps foreign and trade policies will be closely monitored by the investing community, which is waiting to see if he will fulfil his policy pledges to make america great again. apart from that, there are also the elections that will be held in several european countries next year. some fear that the voice of the anti-eu may prevail as member countries continue to suffer years of high unemployment and tepid growth. maybank investment bank research highlights the risk of more aggressive us federal reserve rate hikes as a result of higher inflation and growth expectations from fiscal expansion plans in the us. this will, in turn, widen the monetary divergence between the us and the other major economies, especially with the european central bank having extended its quantitative easing to end-2017, it says in a recent report. on the home front, some have singled out the 14th general election as a factor that could add uncertainty to the local stock market. however, those who believe in an election rally are expecting the polls to get the bulls charging in. to recap, prime minister datuk seri najib razak hinted at the recent umno general assembly that the 14th general election could come anytime soon. despite the events that could cause market jitters next year, fund managers believe that there are still bright spots. plantation is one sector that is starting to look interesting again. this is due to the unexpected rebound in crude palm oil (cpo) prices this year. year to date, they have risen 36.14% to rm3,123 per tonne, the highest since july 2012. at the peak in 2010, it was rm3,619 per tonne. according to inter-pacific securities head of research pong teng siew, this is a good time for cpo as prices tend to move up between november and march because of low output. maybank ib research says in a note that it expects cpo prices to start the year on a high but foresees a correction in the second quarter before hitting the bottom in the third when production reaches its peak. the research house says the average selling price forecast for 2017 is rm2,400 per tonne. plantation is a long-term play. look out for planters with young trees because that is where you will see growth in output, says phillip capital management chief investment officer ang kok heng. construction is another sector worth watching. with massive infrastructure development taking place, such as the mass rapid transit project and pan-borneo highway, and more projects to be implemented over the next two years, construction players are bound to benefit from them. significant projects slated for the next two years include the east coast rail line, kuala lumpur-singapore high-speed rail, light rail transit line 3, gemas-johor baru double tracking and the remaining work for mass rapid transit lines 2 and 3. there is also the rm30 billion melaka gateway trading port, a joint venture by state-funded kaj development sdn bhd and china-based conglomerate powerchina international group ltd. we like pure construction players. there are a lot of contracts not rolled out yet. furthermore, the weakness in the ringgit will not affect many of these players as they can source their raw materials locally, says ang. etiqa insurance and takaful head of research chris eng prefers smaller construction players but cautions that some companies profit margins may be thin despite securing jobs. meanwhile, the agreement between the oil producing nations and the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec) to cut production is expected to rebalance demand and supply of crude oil and provide some reprieve to oil prices. maybank ib research, which has upgraded the sector to positive, believes that it is a good time to bottom fish as the sector has seen the bottom, with most stocks having lost much of their value. the sector is due for a cyclical recovery, on improving sentiment and operating outlook. we see further rerating prospects should saudi aramcos investment of a 50% stake in petronas rapid (refinery and petrochemical integrated development) project materialise, it says. crude oil aside, the weaker ringgit has also continued to provide opportunity for export-oriented counters. ang opines that the soft currency has made malaysian exports more competitive. this bodes well for the export-oriented companies as well as those catering for both the local and foreign markets. yes, export-oriented counters have benefited from [favourable] foreign exchange, but that is only a short-term gain. i believe that there is demand for malaysian goods and they have become more competitive with the weaker ringgit. companies with own-brand products should find themselves on a better footing, he says. etiqas eng says investors should try to buy now and sell by april or may next year, given that most of the closely followed global events will take place in the middle of the year. yes, there are definitely more uncertainties next year compared with 2016.  tenaga nasional despite posting a commendable 10% y-o-y gain in core net profit to rm7.7 billion in its financial year ended aug 31, 2016 (fy2016), tnbs share price has been on a downward trend. at its close of rm13.74 last thursday, the stock had lost 6.52% from its all-time high of rm14.67, recorded in the middle of the year. however, it was still 6.31% higher y-o-y. at this level, tnb is valued only at 10.53 times earnings. a report by ta securities points out that this is one standard deviation away from the groups historical (since 2000) average of 17.1 times. the weakness in tnbs share price is indicative of selling by foreign funds, given the recent depreciation of the ringgit. however, it is important to note that there appears to be plenty of demand for tnbs shares. recall that khazanah nasional bhd placed out a 1.5% block of tnb shares at rm14.30 apiece earlier this year. moving forward, tnb is one of the few blue chips that near-guarantee stable earnings despite the increasingly volatile economic landscape. after all, under the new imbalance cost pass-through mechanism, all variations in fuel costs are passed on to consumers. hence, neither a recovery in coal prices nor further depreciation of the ringgit should have a sizeable impact on tnbs earnings. this resilience makes tnb one of the few defensive stocks that funds can rely on and it is definitely worth more than 10.53 times earnings. nonetheless, the recent trend of awarding power projects to industry newcomers may cap some of the earnings growth over the next few years.  by ben shane lim   gadang holdings the construction and property developer has lost some of its lustre by becoming selective about its new jobs. its net profit fell 20% y-o-y to rm16.7 million in the first quarter ended aug 31. but of more concern is the 60% y-o-y drop in construction revenue during the quarter as its jobs wound up. it does not help that gadangs tender book, which stood at rm10 billion at the start of the year, has fallen to rm5.2 billion. but that is not necessarily a bad thing. its management has always taken a conservative approach to bidding for work, preferring to avoid projects with low margins that cannot justify the risks. gadang does not need to bag many projects, just the best ones. with mrt2 now in full swing, gadang is expected to secure a package, given its performance in constructing viaducts for the first line. a single package would boost the groups order book by rm1 billion. meanwhile, there is the 37km-long lrt3 that gadang is also bidding for. at last thursdays close of rm1.01, the company is valued at 6.51 times earnings, making it one of the cheapest construction stocks on the market. the average earnings multiple in the sector is 14 times. beyond construction, gadang has a sizeable property development arm. this year, the group became development partner for the 24.08-acre kwasa damansara township that has an estimated gross development value (gdv) of rm700 million. this is expected to start contributing to earnings in 2018.  by ben shane lim  kerjaya prospek group a relatively new name on investors radar screens, the company is the product of a backdoor listing by datuk tee eng ho. the bulk of its construction business worth rm438 million was injected into it at the beginning of the year. it also came with an order book of rm2.7 billion and a profit guarantee of rm150 million over three years up to fy2018 ending dec 31. based on its closing price of rm2.08 last thursday, kerjaya prospek had a market capitalisation of rm1 billion, valuing it at 11.55 times earnings. the companys adjusted earnings per share for the year is estimated at 18 sen. kerjaya prospek is not a mere asset injection. this year, it managed to replenish its order book with rm1.5 billion worth of jobs, boosting the outstanding amount to rm2.89 billion and improving its earnings visibility. the company should be able to continue to fill its order book, thanks to the projects of its existing clientele, such as s p setia bhds setia sky seputeh (gdv: rm950 million) and eastern & oriental bhds puro place (gdv: rm800 million), notes kenanga research in a report. kerjaya prospek is also attractive for its cash-rich balance sheet, which is uncommon among its peers. the company still has a cash balance of rm109 million after paying a four sen per share dividend this year, which works out to cash per share of 21.4 sen.  by ben shane lim   sarawak oil palms sops forward price-earnings ratio (per) of 15.42 times is undemanding, especially compared to the average 2017 forecast per of 19 times of its mid-cap peers. the planters proposal to fully acquire shin yang oil palm sdn bhd for rm873 million in july would add 47,000ha of plantation land to its land bank, of which 23,798ha are planted with oil palm and 6,772ha are unplanted. the average tree age in shin yang oil palms plantations is seven years, which would reduce the average age of sops trees to 10.1 years post-acquisition from 11.1 years at present. it is worth noting that shin yang oil palm is being acquired from sops major shareholder, shin yang holding sdn bhd. we believe the young age profile of the acquisition and maturing area of about 2,200ha between 2017 and 2019 should contribute to above-average fresh fruit bunch growth from fy2017e onwards, says kenanga research in an october report. to fund the acquisition, the planter issued 128 million renounceable rights shares on the basis of two for every seven sop shares held. the rights issue was priced at rm2.80 apiece, below sops market price. despite a rebound in crude palm oil prices, sop lagged behind its peers. at its close of rm3.71 last wednesday, the stock had declined 8.65% year to date.  by esther lee   tsh resources the mid-cap planter was among those that suffered from the effects of el niu00f1o this year. nevertheless, analysts are expecting production to improve going forward. for the cumulative nine months ended sept 30, tsh resources recorded a net profit of rm81.6 million after stripping out foreign exchange gains and other exceptional items. about 80% of its revenue and profit is derived from its plantation business while the remaining 20% comes from its wood-product manufacturing and bio-integration divisions. it is worth noting that tsh resources crude palm oil extraction rate is 21%, above the industry average of 20.46%. its fresh fruit bunch yield is high at 24.7% per hectare compared with the industry average of 18.48% while its average tree age is young at eight years. the planter has 67,853ha of unplanted land, which should sustain its growth over the next 10 to 14 years, says bimb securities research. tsh resources has proposed to privatise its listed but loss-making subsidiary, ekowood international bhd, in which it holds a 67.46% stake. analysts believe the privatisation will have negligible impact on the planters shareholders. at its closing price of rm1.87 last thursday, the stock had lost 2.55% year to date.  by esther lee   mkh based on a 2017 price-earnings ratio forecast of 6.65 times, the plantation and property player is a steal for investors, especially since it is expecting the earnings of its plantation division to double next year on the back of stronger crude palm oil prices and better yields. the trees in mkhs 15,400ha plantation in kalimantan, indonesia, are expected to reach the peak of maturity next year. according to alliancedbs research, the estate is expected to achieve a yield of 29 tonnes per hectare, which the research house deems impressive, given the average tree age of seven years. the company plans to purchase 2,000ha of plantation land near its existing estate in indonesia for rm15 million. this would increase its plantation area to about 18,000ha. as of now, the companys largest contributing segment is still its property division, which accounts for 70% of its revenue. mkh has not been spared the effects of a soft property market. however, its focus on providing affordable homes resulted in unbilled sales of rm827.5 million as at sept 30, which should keep the group going for 1u00bd years. the company has a sizeable land bank in the kajang/semenyih corridor, which will see it benefit from the completion of the mrt lines next year. mkh recently proposed a cash call followed by a bonus issue. closing at rm2.86 last thursday, the stock had gained 34.47% year to date. by esther lee   samchem holdings in contrast to the general trend of disappointing corporate results, samchems earnings are back on the growth path. it posted a net profit of rm11.48 million for the nine months ended sept 30, 2016, up 48% from the previous corresponding period, while revenue grew 8.3% to rm483.7 million. its management is confident of sustainable earnings growth, thanks to rising demand for petrochemicals in asean, especially vietnam and indonesia, where manufacturing plants are sprouting up. sales volume is growing 30% to 40%. the [growth] pattern is likely to continue, if not become stronger, its ceo, datuk ng lian poh, told the edge in an interview. according to him, selling prices have also stabilised. the homegrown speciality petrochemicals distributor has a foothold in malaysia, indonesia and vietnam. with a market capitalisation of rm130 million, it evolved into a leading player in asean after the consolidation of the regional industry in recent years. ng believes there are exciting prospects for the petrochemicals industry in vietnam and indonesia. however, samchem is not just targeting these two countries but the whole of asean with its 450 million

exciting business of manufacturing and trading yamaha motorcycles in malaysia and vietnam through its 24% associate stake in yamaha motor vietnam co ltd. thanks to vietnams fast-growing economy, many feel hl industries is facing exciting days ahead. after all, the country has a young population of over 90 million, the vast majority of whom use motorcycles as their primary mode of transport. in its first quarter ended sept 30, the company registered year-on-year revenue growth of 9%, attributable to strong sales of motorcycles and ceramic tiles. net profit surged 44.5% to rm64.77 million on higher contribution from motorcycle sales. hl industries vietnam associate contributed rm30.7 million to earnings. in fact, hl industries net profit in fy2016 jumped 42.7% year on year to rm247.22 million due to a higher contribution from its vietnam associate. kenanga research says in a report that the companys yamaha motorcycles are enjoying increasing demand in vietnam as a result of

the company saw its earnings climb in its latest two quarters after a dip in the first quarter. for the cumulative nine months ended sept 30, its revenue increased to rm144.3 million, up 15.6% from a year ago, as it saw higher sales across all regions, save for europe, while net profit registered a 2.8% growth to rm25.79 million. more than 60% of kawan foods sales is derived from its export markets. the company has a strong following in the us, which accounted for 34% of its sales in the last nine months of its financial year. cimb research says in a report that steady sales in the domestic market also suggest that the frozen food manufacturers local business has recovered from the impact of the goods and services tax. as at sept 30, kawan food had a cash pile of rm67.58 million, and it declared a special dividend of 3.5 sen per share in november. this was on top of a 2.5 sen per share interim dividend that was announced in its third quarter results. at a 2017 price-earnings ratio forecast of 29.92 times, many would consider kawan foods valuation lofty. however, the potential of better sales in its export markets, given that malaysian exports have become more competitive with the weakening ringgit, could be a reason to give kawan food a second look.  by esther lee   e.a. technique (m) it may not be hard to fathom why this oil and gas stock had tumbled nearly 47% year to date as at last thursday. the prolonged industry downturn saw it slip from its peak of rm1.46 in august last year to a record low of 45 sen at end-november. it bounced back to 59 sen last thursday but was still trading below its 2014 initial public offering price of 65 sen. some fund managers opine that the counter has been oversold, given its high earnings visibility compared with its peers in the oil and gas industry. but its management must be puzzled at the selling pressure on the stock, although the company receives steady recurring income from its long-term charters. e.a. technique managing director datuk abdul hak md amin told the edge that it was business as usual at the company despite the oil rout. we are less affected by the downturn in the oil and gas industry because our clients are mainly in the mid and downstream segments, such as petrochemical companies and refineries, he said, adding that the utilisation of the companys fleet of vessels was more than 90%. furthermore, its vessels are chartered for transporting products, like gasoline and methanol, in the region. thus, the risk of contract termination is low because the demand for such materials remains steady. for the nine months ended sept 30, the company posted a higher net profit of rm30.49 million, or 6.05 sen per share, against rm26.19 million, or 5.2 sen per share, a year ago. in the meantime, the new vessels coming on stream with charters are expected to boost its earnings.  by kathy fong   eg industries the kedah-based company is a growth stock despite the current harsh economic climate. a new substantial shareholder brought change to the company, enabling it to climb the value chain by providing box-building and reap the benefits. box-building refers to end-to-end manufacturing services that start at designing and end at the shipping of the completed products to end users. eg industries has graduated from being just an original equipment manufacturer. it now serves world-renowned electrical and electronic brand names in several industries, including consumer electronics, ict, medical, automotive and telecommunications. in fy2016 ended june 30, eg industries posted a pre-tax profit of rm19.7 million, down from rm23.63 million the year before. however, it had booked a disposal gain of rm15.38 million in fy2015. excluding the extraordinary gain, the groups pre-tax profit would have been rm8.24 million that year. the companys growth momentum continued in its 1qfy2017, with pre-tax profit rising 41.6% year on year to rm7.14 million. we like eg industries for its gradual transition into a vertically integrated ems (electronic manufacturing service) player through its continuous expansion into the higher margin, full-assembly services segment, and its projected three-year core earnings cagr of 40%, says uob-kay hian. the research house sees the companys net profit ballooning to rm30.6 million, or 11.4 sen per share, in fy2017 and rm36.7 million, or 13.6 sen per share, in fy2018. eg industries share price was hovering in a tight range of 80 sen to 90 sen for most of the year.  by kathy fong   kimlun corp the johor-based company has been a beneficiary of the property boom in the state. while having been involved in a large number of residential projects, kimlun has also taken on infrastructure jobs in johor. however, it has risen to prominence for manufacturing segmental box girders for the mrt project under its manufacturing division. at its near-record-high closing price of rm2.14 last thursday, kimluns share price had surged 56% year to date. however, its valuation, at 8.23 times earnings, is still not stretched. in the nine months ended sept 30, the companys net profit rose 17% year on year to rm57.7 million. interestingly, revenue fell 14%, primarily due to lower contributions from the construction segment. the fall was compensated for by higher margins. kimlun bagged rm1.1 billion of new construction jobs this year (compared with rm700 million in fy2015), boosting the groups order book to rm1.93 billion. its manufacturing segment, meanwhile, saw its orders double to rm300 million, driven by a rm200 million contract to supply segmental box girders for mrt2, which was awarded in march. moving forward, the group is expected to bag the contract to supply tunnel lining segments for mrt2 as well. kimlun also supplies pre-cast concrete products to singapore. it is diversifying its offerings, now also supplying singapore with rail sleepers and parapet walls. as a result, the company has benefited from the weaker ringgit. kimlun has paid dividends consistently and is expected to declare a dividend of 6.8 sen this year, for a yield of 3.27%. at the same time, the group has a relatively healthy net gearing of 9.9%.  by ben shane lim "}, "80": {"date_posted": "5/1/2017", "title": "umw, uwm-og gain on naga 7's 18-month contract ", "article": " kuala lumpur (jan 5): shares

preference of inherent earnings quality, an attractive valuation and growth at reasonable price. malaysian resources corp bhd (buy rating with a target price (tp) of rm2.08) key catalysts for the company include their construction orderbook of rm1.5 billion providing 36-month construction backlog underpinned by 1.91x fy15 construction revenue cover. secondly, the development of kwasa damansara plot c-8 worth rm3.08 billion, kuala lumpur sports city valued at rm1.6 billion and cyberjaya city centre with a gross development value of rm9 billion and finally the potential sale of the eastern dispersal link (edl) highway for rm1.8 billion to unlock its balance sheet. tune protect group bhd (buy rating with tp of rm2.18) midf research is overweight on tune protect group premised on the fact that the group has a first mover's advantage of digital insurance space and it will continuously grow within that parameter. tune has also predominant market share in local travel insurance and extends to establish new airline partnerships and venture beyond airline industry in the next two years. this will translate into positive significant fundamental impact, which the firm expects a sturdy fy17 estimated earnings growth and improvement in underwriting margin of 15% and 23% respectively. on balance sheet, the group will stand on strong forecasted double-digit return on equity of 17% and a net cash position. malaysian bulk carriers bhd (maybulk) (buy rating with tp of rm1.04) the baltic dry index (bdi), which measures charter rates across dry bulk ship sizes and routes, has recently surpassed the 1,200 level after averaging at 500 for the majority of 1hfy16. the recent surge in the bdi can be attributed to a recent increase in coal and iron ore imports from china due to lower domestic production of these materials and a pick-up in demand for construction and power generation. in addition, the prospects of the us embarking on infrastructure spending as part of its stimulus measures have also propped up sentiment on the industry. the firm's 'buy' call on maybulk with target price of rm1.04 is based on five-year average price-to-book ratio of 0.88x. deleum bhd (buy rating with tp of rm1.25) deleum is an oil and gas services specialist with undemanding valuation currently trading at forward price-earnings ratio (per) of only 7x. the company's orderbook stands at approximately rm2.9 billion, providing earnings visibility of up to four years. in addition, the company is a frontrunner for petronas maintenance, construction and modification works worth

10 picks after a recent share price correction which saw a 21% drop from its high of rm3.20 reached in august 2016 stemming from the ringgit losing ground against the greenback. however, the research house said it was not too concerned about the falling ringgit as airasia's unhedged exposure to us dollar for its borrowings and expenses are capped at 33% and 50% respectively. meanwhile, airasia recently recorded a cumulative nine-month (9mfy16) load factor of 89% which was a group record. looking ahead, the fourth quarter of 2016 will be even better as octoberu2013november loads have already hit 93%. airasia highlighted that it has received eight non-binding bids for full ownership in air aviation capital and one for an 80% stake. midf research said it is increasingly optimistic on the potential for special dividends as the deal draws nearer to a possible conclusion. it said that a divestment of a 70% to 80% stake in airasia's leasing arm could translate into proceeds of rm2.9 billion to rm3.3 billion (rm1.04 to rm1.19 per share) which could be used to pare debts, fund future expansion and be paid out as special dividends. ta ann holdings bhd (buy rating with tp of rm4.70)

post-us elections. ex-cash, bermaz auto now trades at just 9x cy17 earnings. the japanese yen has actually weakened to rm3.80u2013rm3.90 levels and it was mainly the us dollar (which bermaz auto has no exposure to) that strengthened against the ringgit in the past month. key share price catalysts over the next 12 months include an attractive dividend yield of 7% (based on 85% payout ratio)

- 17, 2016. early last month, otto marine ltd, which owns a large fleet of offshore support vessels, became the first company listed on the singapore exchange to be taken private since the onset of a downturn in the oil and gas sector. controlling shareholder yaw chee siew, via his vehicle ocean international capital ltd, offered 32 singapore cents (96 sen) per share or a total of s$26.37 million (about rm79 million) for the 38.8% stake in otto marine that he does not own. yaw is the son of tan sri yaw teck seng, the patriarch of the samling group, which has interests in the plantation, logging, property development and automotive sectors, among others. the senior yaw is listed by forbes as malaysias 19th richest man. prior to the general offer, otto marine was trading at a heavy discount to its book value at 0.17 times. interestingly, since the offer by the yaw family, a possible privatisation wave is expected to hit the republic. analysts and market watchers have a long list of potential privatisation candidates, including asl marine holdings ltd, pacc offshore services holdings ltd (in which malaysian bulk carriers bhd owns a 21% stake), marco polo marine ltd, mermaid maritime public co ltd, baker technology ltd, cse global ltd, dyna-mac holdings ltd. in malaysia, while some industry players have admitted to having contemplated a privatisation, obtaining funding seems to be an uphill task, given the rather unexciting economic outlook. petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) president and ceo datuk wan zulkiflee wan ariffin summed it up well in an interview with the edge recently on mergers and acquisitions: because of the difficulty in predicting what the future prices will be, there is a very big gap in terms of expectation from the buyers and sellers side. the buyers side will say oil price will continue (being depressed) for a long time but the sellers side will say, no, it will pick up.  this scenario could be true for privatisations as well, perhaps. an analyst says she sees only one likely candidate  bumi armada bhd, whose share price had been beaten down to 65 sen at end-may. there are many factors at play when you talk about a privatisation, most importantly, whether you can get the requisite funding. how much of the company does the controlling shareholder own, can they raise funds? here are some companies that a handful of industry players and analysts think may take the privatisation route.   bumi armada billionaire t ananda krishnan controls 34.92% of the company. at its closing price of 73 sen last tuesday, bumi armadas market capitalisation was rm4.28 billion compared with rm15.5 billion at its peak of rm2.64 in april 2012. it would cost ananda krishnan some rm2.8 billion to buy out the other shareholders, excluding any premium. bumi armada has an order book of rm24.2 billion and an extension option of rm12.2 billion. the company is in the process of completing the conversion of three floating production storage and offloading vessels while the floating storage unit malta is undergoing conversion this year. in 1qfy2016 ended march 31, bumi armada posted a net profit of rm23.43 million on revenue of rm430.77 million. its cash pile stood at rm859.82 million while on the other side of the balance sheet, it had long-term borrowings of rm6.04 billion and short-term debt of rm1.44 billion. its net asset value per share was rm1.14. while there has been talk of ananda krishnan looking to sell his block to misc bhd or shapoorji pallonji mistry, none of it can be substantiated.  malaysia marine and heavy engineering holdings bhd earlier this year, there was talk of the company being taken private but this did not materialise.  misc bhd holds a 66.5% stake in the group while petronas controls 62.7% of mhb. since september 2014, mhbs shares have tumbled more than 65%. they closed at rm1.12 last tuesday, giving the company a market capitalisation of rm1.79 billion. in the first quarter of fy2016, mhb suffered a net loss of rm7.58 million compared with a net profit of rm36.03 million in the previous corresponding period. revenue plunged to rm256.72 million from rm719.50 million previously. however, oil and gas stalwarts doubt that mhb will be privatised. it (mhb) was listed in late october 2010. the talk then was that petronas wanted to share some of its wealth, thus the listing of some of its companies, an oil and gas executive says.  sapurakencana petroleum bhd the companys shares hit a record low of rm1.29 on june 27 but rebounded to close at rm1.44 last tuesday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm8.63 billion. other than the challenging environment, seadrill ltd, the vehicle of billionaire tycoon john fredriksen, sold out of sapurakencana in april, adding to the gloom. at its peak, seadrill held about 12% of sapurakencana but gradually pared down its holding in large tranches as the company suffered from the fall in oil prices.  the shares have shed 65% of their value since september 2014. as at april 30, the companys net asset value per share was rm1.98. in the first quarter ended april 30, sapurakencana posted a net profit of rm110.31 million from rm1.94 billion in revenue. the shamsuddin family, which is the controlling shareholder with a 17% stake, would have to fork out close to rm6.94 billion in market value to privatise sapurakencana, excluding any premium offered. the employees provident fund is the second largest shareholder with 15% while the others are permodalan nasional bhd (11.76%) and tan sri mokhzani mahathir (10.18%). sapurakencanas asset base, which includes producing blocks such as pm323, pm318, pm329 and the aakbnlp field, all off kertih, and exploration assets such as sb310, 311 and 312 planned for 2016 and sk-318 off the coast of miri slated for production at the tail end of 2018, and its drilling and pipelay assets could nudge banks into financing such a takeover.  boustead heavy industries corp bhd though not a pure oil and gas counter, bhic does have a fabrication yard and builds offshore support vessels for the sector. back in 2007, lembaga tabung angkatan tentera (ltat) and its units took over psc industries bhd with much fanfare. there was so much hope for the company and it was the darling of investors back then. today, boustead holdings bhd, a unit of ltat, controls 65% of bhic. the army fund also owns an 8.16% direct stake in bhic. this means ltat and its unit control at least 73% of bhic. since october last year, bhics shares have shed more than 36%. the stock hit its 52-week low of rm1.41 on june 24 and closed at rm1.56 last tuesday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm387.6 million. in the first financial quarter ended march, bhic suffered a net loss of rm19.04 million on sales of rm62.99 million.  yinson holdings bhd last tuesday, yinsons shares surged 10 sen to close at rm2.88, giving it a market capitalisation of rm3.14 billion. other than an announcement pertaining to the company buying back its own shares, there is no other statement explaining the sudden gain in its share price. yinson now has 3.23 million treasury shares. while there has been no real drop in yinsons share price  down only 16% since september 2014  the argument for privatisation could stem from the current uncertain economic outlook.  the lim family, headed by patriarch lim han weng, has 33.57% equity interest in the company while tan sri mokhzani mahathir has 17.54%. collectively, the two hold 51.11% of yinson. the other substantial shareholders include the epf (10.53%) and aia bhd (7%). in its first financial quarter ended april 30, yinson posted a net profit of rm22.38 million on revenue of rm211.38 million. its net asset value per share stood at rm1.55. it is noteworthy that mokhzani surfaced in yinson in june 2014, forking out rm2.20 per share in a rights issue when crude oil prices were starting to slide. losing almost a third of their share prices has made most oil and gas companies attractive targets for privatisation. as market watchers say, as long as the world needs fossil fuel, well-managed oil and gas firms will remain attractive and some will regain their lost lustre. however, by then, their valuation would have at least doubled.

termination, petronas will reimburse all outstanding capital and operational expenditures to the contractors by june 2017. analysts are largely positive on the development, as they do not see any

decision next year. \"the cessation of the risk service contract (rsc), which contributed rm100 million to group net profit in fy16, will be effective on sept 30, which means that this project will continue to contribute as usual to sapurakencanas 2qfy17 earnings,\" he said. \"our forecasts are unchanged pending the announcement of the groups 2qfy17 in september this year, which will provide guidance on the groups low asset utilisation levels,\" he said, adding that the group's 1qfy17 results have already reached its fy17 net profit forecast. his target price on sapurakencana was rm1.40 per share based on fy17 book value, which includes a 50% discount on the groups intangible asset value. meanwhile, publicinvest research also viewed the cessation positively, considering questions on the economic viability of this development, given the sharply lower oil prices amid significantly higher operational costs with the involvement of floating production, storage and offloading (fpso). \"as a matter of prudence, we had excluded contributions from the berantai project in our initial earnings and valuation assumptions, given the very possibility of this happening,\" the firm said.

\"fully valued\" call with unchanged target price of rm1.20 on sapurakencana, after the rsc contract termination. the firm's analyst tan jianyuan believed the negative sentiment impact of this news is mitigated by good progress made thus far, in terms of new gas discovery in the longer run. \"we expect the proceeds to be used towards paring down the groups gearing to 1.15 times by fy18, from 1.27 times currently, with the projected annual interest cost savings amounting to rm45 million to rm50 million. we are also delighted to see its net gearing being pared down to more manageable levels,\"

petronas said the cessation of the risk service contract (rsc) contract will allow it to minimise the projects long-term value erosion and optimise the development and production activities in malaysia, in line with its efforts to reduce costs and increase the efficiency of its operations. petronas had earlier announced that it aimed to cut up to rm50 billion in operating and capital expenditure over the next four years in the face of sliding global oil prices. oil has slipped from about us$50 (rm199.5) a barrel to below us$45 in the last month. brent crude, the international oil benchmark, traded at us$46.26 yesterday. in separate filings with the exchanges yesterday, london-listed petrofac ltd and bursa malaysia-listed sapurakencana said a mutual agreement among the three parties was reached to terminate the berantai rsc. with the cessation of the rsc, which will be effective on sept 30, petronas will reimburse all outstanding capital and operational expenditures to the contractors by june 2017. as part of the arrangement, the ownership of berantai floating production, storage and offloading (fpso) vessel will be transferred to petronas, they added. we continue to support petronas in its efforts to reduce costs and optimise its operations with a view to preserving the long-term value of the project. together with our partner, we have managed to operate the facilities over the past four years safely, said sapurakencana president and group chief executive officer tan sri shahril shamsuddin in a separate statement yesterday. meanwhile, petrofac said it will use the cash proceeds for general corporate purposes. the company added that as a result of the cessation of the rsc and the fpso transaction, it will incur a small impairment charge. on jan 31, 2011, petronas had awarded the rsc for its berantai field to petrofac to lead the development and production of petroleum from the berantai field. it was the first rsc awarded by petronas and had marked the start of development for the countrys marginal oil and gas (o&g) fields. petronas remains the project owner, while petrofac has a 50% stake in the rsc, alongside local partners  sapurakencanas wholly-owned subsidiaries kencana energy sdn bhd and sapura energy ventures sdn bhd  both of which hold a 25% equity interest. the berantai partners were to develop the field and subsequently operate the field for a period of seven years after first gas production. when fully operational, the field was expected to produce about 150 million standard cu ft of gas per day (mmscfd) and 10,000 barrels of oil. in november 2012, petronas announced that natural gas production from the berantai field was successfully brought on stream on oct 20, 2012. the gas is processed at the berantai fpso and exported to the existing onshore terminal at kerteh. the full field development, excluding delivery of the fpso, was anticipated to require capital investment of approximately us$800 million, of which petrofacs share was 50%. sapurakencana shares closed up one sen or 0.72% at rm1.40 yesterday as the market was largely neutral on the news. its market capitalisation stood at rm8.33 billion. the stock has slid steadily for more than a year in response to the slump in oil prices, and reached an all-time low of rm1.32 on june 27. jf apex research oil and gas analyst lee cherng wee said sapurakencana will be able to recover its investment and reduce overall operating costs following the disbursement from petronas. this could also boost cash flow and gearing when the money comes in june next year, he told the edge financial daily in an email reply. as at april 30, 2016, sapurakencanas total borrowings stood at rm17.34 billion versus its cash and cash equivalents of rm2.34 billion. its net-debt-to-equity ratio stood at 1.3 times for the financial year ended jan 31, 2016 (fy16). an analyst who declined to be named said the cessation is positive to sapurakencanas balance sheet as the company could use the cash proceeds to pare down its debt. under the current operating environment, cash conservation is very important for any company so that they can look out for new opportunities, said the analyst, estimating that sapurakencana may need another four years to recoup its investment in the berantai field should the contract continue. another analyst believed that the termination could be due to the low oil price environment. brownfield projects come at a higher production cost. at the current oil price of us$45 to us$50 per barrel, it is either the company did not make money or made razor thin profits from the oil being produced. a third analyst said his fy17 earnings forecast for sapurakencana has factored in the termination of the berantai field as the management had indicated it during a recent results briefing. sapurakencana slipped to a net loss of rm791.56 million for fy16 from rm1.43 billion in fy15, due to impairment provisions on o&g assets totalling rm1.14 billion and deposit on acquisition written off worth rm172.5 million."}, "95": {"date_posted": "13/6/2016", "title": "seacera group, uem edgenta, bcorp,

o&g) posted a net loss of rm65.08 million in the first quarter ended march (1qfy16) compared to a net profit of rm32.15 million a year ago. the group told the bourse that its revenue more than halved to rm87.68 million from rm312.5 million. it said both its drilling services and oilfield services segments contributed lower revenue in 1qfy16 due to much lower levels of exploration, development and production activities in the oil and gas industry. lafarge malaysia bhd's net profit fell nearly 72% to rm20.65 million in the first quarter ended march (1qfy16) from rm73.69 million a year ago, on

in an associate, coupled with higher depreciation charges and higher finance cost arising from the borrowings raised late last year to fund the acquisition of holcim malaysia, also contributed to the group's lower profit before tax,\" it said. its interest income of rm600,000 for the current quarter was also lower compared with rm1.9 million in the corresponding quarter last year, due to lesser amount of funds placed on short term deposits. quarterly revenue, meanwhile, slipped 3.8% to rm669.78 million from rm696.09 million a year earlier, mainly attributed to lower sales contribution from its cement segment, due to stiff competition in the market and continued pricing pressures. jcy international bhd has ceased the operation of its subsidiary in china, foshan yk hdd co ltd, with

told bursa malaysia the loss was due to lower oil palm production on the back of dry weather brought on by the el nino phenomenon, lower fair value recognition of forestry assets and a foreign currency translation loss from its indonesian assets. this was despite the group's revenue for the period increasing 8.77% to rm89.52 million from rm82.3 million. british american tobacco (malaysia)

rm6.59 million from rm1.54 million in the first quarter ended march (1qfy16), due to expenses incurred in the course of business commencement and start-ups. this is despite revenue for the quarter

months of 2016. tanjung offshore bhd's net loss widen by 138.1% to rm4.69 million in the first quarter ended march (1qfy16) from rm1.97 million a year ago, on lower revenue from its engineering

expenses expanded by 56.8% to rm5.48 million. revenue, however, increased by 47.3% to rm11.99 million in 1qfy16 from rm8.14 million, mostly on contributions from its operational reliability and

and better production efficiencies. the group told the bourse that favourable foreign exchange rates of the group's trading currencies such as the us dollar and euro contributed to the improved results. revenue came in 5.3% higher at rm74.5 million in 1qfy16 compared with rm70.7 million a year ago, it said. rubberex also declared a first interim single tiered dividend of 1.5 sen per share of

registered a revenue of rm151.5 million for 1qfy16, which is 7.1% lower compared to rm163.1 million a year ago. ho hup construction company bhd is revising its growth in profit after tax (pat)

hup ceo datuk derek kl wong said after the company's annual general meeting today, the group is readjusting the timing of property launches, and the management is cautious given the slowdown in the property market. the group also told the bourse today that its net profit for the first quarter ended march 31, 2016 (1qfy16) dropped 5.04% to rm19.08 million from rm20.09 million a year ago, due to additional financing cost incurred for corporate acquisitions as well as cost for funding new project developments. revenue dropped 7.83% to rm81.08 million from rm87.96 million, due to no progress

sdn bhd. genting plantation bhd's net profit slumped 48.75% to rm26.99 million in the first quarter ended march 31, 2016 (1qfy16) from rm52.66 million a year ago, due to lower contributions from

malaysia weekly, on may 2 - 8, 2016. its been slightly more than a year since datuk wan zulkiflee wan ariffin took the helm of state-owned petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) as its president and ceo  and what a tumultuous time it has been. for starters, earlier this year, the company offered a rare separation scheme, reducing its staff count by 1,060, or about 2% of its 51,000 workforce. this comes against a backdrop of plummeting oil prices. international benchmark west texas intermediate (wti) hit a record high of more than us$145 per barrel in early july 2008 but plunged to a 13-year low of us$26.21 in february this year. over the past 12 months, wti has averaged only us$44.08. as a result, petronas has scrapped several plans, such as the once-in-vogue enhanced oil recovery or eor and the development of marginal oil fields. there have also been significant cuts in capital expenditure (capex) and operational expenditure (opex) of rm50 billion over the next four years, starting with rm15 billion to rm20 billion this year alone.  earnings drag the oil companys earnings for the year ended december 2015 took a beating as well. it recorded a revenue of rm247.66 billion, a 25% dip from 2014, and after-tax profits of rm20.86 billion, 56% lower than 2014. petronas made provisions for impairments of close to rm17.7 billion in 2015, and rm23 billion in 2014, which added to the bleak financial performance. in an exclusive interview with the edge, wan zul, in his candid manner, explains, we just want to be prudent, and of course when the price comes back, we can always write back. asked about the downturn, he says, i think its a real test for the whole industry. its a structural shift for the industry, and for petronas, we are responding to the environment. what we do not want to do is to waste a crisis, so we are looking internally at how to improve and looking at how we can be more efficient. this has been the focus for the last few months. the psyche of the organisation is different at us$100 or us$110 oil than at us$30 or us$40 oil. at the current us$30 or us$40 oil, the psyche is that we have to be efficient and lean. its easier to get that kind of behaviour now than in an us$100 or us$110 oil situation. so, we are being tested in a very different way today. our role here is also to prepare an organisation that can withstand the test of time in terms of all these challenges that we see and work on a new normal, he goes on. in a nutshell, while oil prices have dropped close to 60% over the past f ive years, crimping profits, petronas still has to proceed with some of its larger investments, such as the rm53 billion refinery and petrochemical integrated development (rapid) project. meanwhile, the us$36 billion (rm140 billion) canadian liquefied natural gas (lng) project and export terminal is still awaiting the final environmental certificate from the canadian government. the transformation of petronas is hinged on project cactus, which aims to expedite cash generation and cost-efficiency initiatives and simplify procedures, among other things. for the longer term, the national oil corporation will spend a lot more time on the culture of the organisation. this is our strategic response to the whole crisis. we intend also to look at what we can do to make the malaysian oil and gas industry more efficient, but this will be going forward, after we have all these internal things in place, wan zul says. he seems to have his work cut out for him.   industry consolidation while petronas has talked about consolidating the many oil and gas service providers, there has been little indication of how this will be done and when it will take place. wan zul says the oil company is presently undertaking a study and more clarity will come towards the end of the year. while not divulging any details, he says the intention is to make the whole industry more efficient. he highlights the requirement for companies to be registered with petronas to win jobs, which could indicate that there will be higher barriers to entry for the sector. that may successfully force consolidation and weed out the weaker players, something that requires political will. at present, one of the notable mergers and acquisitions involves dayang enterprise solutions bhd taking over perdana petroleum bhd. in may last year, dayang launched a mandatory general offer (mgo) to acquire all the remaining shares and warrants of perdana it didnt already own at an offer price of rm1.55 per share and 84 sen per warrant, in a deal worth rm787 million. the mgo was triggered after dayang upped its stake from 29.77% to 35.51% when it bought a 5.74% block from affin hwang asset management for rm66.6 million, or rm1.55 per share. while there has been talk of a controlling block in bumi armada bhd, as well as a strategic stake in perisai petroleum teknologi bhd, being put up for sale, nothing significant has materialised. wan zul reiterates that there will be more clarity at year-end. i do not want to pre-empt anything. we really need to do a lot of stock taking and [look at] what the options are, what is the least painful way, and how petronas can play its role. some observers have pointed out that while malaysia has 3,200 oil and gas companies, which are registered with petronas, norway just has 700 players in this sector, which would indicate that something has to be done. open tenders have also been the norm, with the previous management of petronas wanting the local companies to be more competitive. but this did not go down well with the players, many of which are politically linked. groups such as majlis tindakan ekonomi melayu and malay rights group pertubuhan pribumi perkasa malaysia have been especially vocal about this. some companies, including th heavy engineering bhd, a fabricator controlled by pilgrim fund lembaga tabung haji, have been badly hit by the open tenders. even malaysia marine and heavy engineering holdings bhd  an indirect subsidiary in which petronas has a 66.5% stake  has been affected. wan zul admits that there are huge tasks confronting him. it will be a challenge but i think we just have to give it a shot because thats the right thing for the industry. we have to take it one day at a time. his predecessor, tan sri shamsul azhar abbas, had come under fire in 2013 for similar attempts to make the industry more competitive and implement higher standards in the industry. wan zul is likely to know more about this than anyone else. while he appears confident and at ease, his struggle to change the way things are being done now wont be easy.  no longer a lifelong employer a job with petronas was once seen as a life-long career, but wan zul is out to change that notion. you cant take your job for granted. if you dont perform, theres a chance you wont have a job in this organisation. it must be merit-based; we place a lot of emphasis on meritocracy, he says. petronas recent layoffs came as a shock, but its review of staffing needs is likely to be an ongoing process. retrenchments at other oil majors, such as royal dutch shell, have been even more severe. shell is letting go of some 10,300 of its 94,000-strong workforce. oil and gas service provider schlumberger is looking at retrenching 10,000 more employees. that would mean it has cut 34,000 jobs, or 26% of its workforce, since november 2014. haliburton, meanwhile, is laying off 5,000 employees, or 8% of its workforce. compared to these, the layoffs at petronas do not seem that significant. but whether wan zul can further trim the workforce remains to be seen. his goal is to make petronas more efficient and lean.  potential minefields some of the issues wan zul has raised are potential minefields, but it remains to be seen if he will actually get to see his plans through. one of his predecessors, tan sri hassan marican  who was petronas ceo and president from february 1995 until february 2010  had the support of then prime minister tun dr mahathir mohamad to implement his vision. industry insiders were aware at the time that irking hassan meant irking the premier, which gave the petronas chief a freer hand to run the company.  shamsul replaced hassan in february 2010 and continued until march 2015. he was 57 and had already retired when he was called to take over the reins. some of his initiatives drew strong criticism from bumiputera business associations. so, how wan zul fares will likely depend on the support he gets from the government.   there is also the question of how much dividends petronas will be able to pay its sole shareholder  the government. for the longest time, petronas chiefs have had to grapple with balancing the need to re-invest some of its earnings for future profits and paying dividends to the government. wan zul, however, is unperturbed. i think the shareholder understands [and] takes a long-term view. i dont have much issue in discussing the quantum of dividends, he says.

quarter of 2015 (4q15) on mean of platts singapore (mops) shock. going forward, with crude oil prices at years high with a more stable price movement, earnings shock is unlikely in the upcoming 2qfy16. all these should be good reasons enough to accumulate this index-linked stock. petdag reported its 1qfy16 results, which came within expectations with a net profit of rm219.4 million, accounting for 26%/25% of house/street fy16 full-year estimates. a 12 sen net dividend per share was declared for 1qfy16 (ex-date: may 24; payment date: june 8), which was lower than the 20 sen paid in 4qfy15, but the same as 1qfy15. despite revenue sliding 18% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) to rm4.93 billion, 1qfy16 net profit surged 138% to rm219.4 million from rm92.1 million in 4qfy15, as the preceding quarter results were hit by a sharp decline for a brief period in mops prices as crude oil prices plunged 30% q-o-q back then. in addition, 1qfy16 operating expenditure was lower by rm107.1 million on lower repair and maintenance, as well as lower staff costs. on the other hand, the decline in top line was mainly led by a 21% contraction in the overall average selling price (asp), but sales volume increased. 1qfy16 net profit rose 7% year-on-year from rm205.8 million in the same quarter last year, which was mainly helped by other higher income by rm27 million, due to accounting reclassification arising from the goods and services tax, as well as a higher interest income. meanwhile, 1qfy16 revenue declined 19% from rm6.1 billion in 1qfy15, as the overall asp fell 20% as mops decreased. this included a 12% dip in asp for the retail segment and a 29% plunge in asp for the commercial segment. if prices remain at their current high levels or trend higher for the remaining quarters, 2qfy16 asp is likely to be stronger q-o-q, which may help to boost its top line. meanwhile, in view of the relatively stable movement of crude oil prices in contrast to the sharp decline during the brief period in the second half of 2014 and 4q15, this could reduce the risk of earnings shock in the coming quarters. we keep our fy16 to fy18 estimates unchanged for now. with the rolling over of valuation base year to calendar year 2017 (cy17) from cy16, our new tp is now raised to rm25.40, based on -0.5 standard deviation (sd) three-year moving average price-earnings ratio (per) of 27 times, from rm24.20 previously, which was pegged to -0.5sd three-year moving average per of 28 times. the share price of petdag has fallen 11% since our last downgrade to underperform three months ago. risks to our call include a drop in business volume and a sudden plunge in mops within a brief period of time.  kenanga research, may 12 "}, "99": {"date_posted": "18/3/2016", "title": "sapura resources asset sale fails to excite investors", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on march 18, 2016.  kuala lumpur: the proposed divestment deal that is expected to earn sapura resources bhd rm315 million cash, a sum bigger than its market capitalisation, has failed to lift its share price.  the stock opened on a strong note and soared to a four-month high of rm1.60 within 10 minutes after the opening bell. but the rally lost momentum later in the afternoon, sapura resources share price closed one sen lower at rm1.36 yesterday. its trading volume swelled to 2.95 million shares  the highest level since july 2014. investors have shrugged off the proposed divestment mainly because a large portion of the cash received would be ploughed back to sapura resources for investment, which would have a gestation period before yielding any return. sapura resources would only distribute barely rm6.98 million in the form of special dividend to shareholders. this would translate into dividend per share of 3.6 sen. in short, earnings visibility isnt clear while dividend payment is minimal, said a fund manager. to recap, sapura resources announced on wednesday that it intends to sell off its education assets to ilmu education group sdn bhd, the education arm of government-owned private equity firm ekuiti nasional bhd, for rm246.99 million cash. prior to the stake sale, there will be a proposed reorganisation, which will involve the disposal by apiit to ilmu of its entire interest in asia pacific schools sdn bhd for rm138.8 million. thereafter, apiit will declare dividends, whereby ilmu and sapura resources will be entitled to dividends of rm70.79 million and rm68.01 million respectively. the education assets comprise a 49% equity interest in apiit sdn bhd, 49% stake in asia pacific university sdn bhd and 37.61% stake in asia pacific institute of information technology lanka (pvt) ltd. the remaining interest in these assets is already owned by ilmu. sapura resources said it is disposing of its education assets as it is more value accretive to the group in the long run to use the funds from the disposal to concentrate on growing its property business, namely its lot 91 kuala lumpur city centre development, as well as its aviation business. the companys aviation service business at subang skypark and senai international airport remained loss-making as at oct 31, 2015, while its property development joint venture is still in its infancy. the current slowdown in the property market does not draw keen interest in the groups joint development of office tower and convention centre with klcc holdings sdn bhd in jalan kia peng, a stones throw from petronas twin towers. furthermore, the stake in apiit is the key earnings contributor to sapura resources. for the nine-month period ended oct 31, 2015 (9mfy16), sapura resources aviation service business posted a pre-tax loss of close to rm2 million, while its property investment business contributed a profit before tax of rm8.74 million. on a net of tax basis, sapura resources was in the red in 9mfy16, with a net loss of rm548,000, compared to a net profit of rm20.1 million in the previous corresponding period. the earnings in the previous corresponding period were boosted by a rm14.3 million gain on investment from the purchase of a 50% stake in a 1.88-acre (0.76ha) parcel of commercial freehold land in jalan kia peng."}, "100": {"date_posted": "14/3/2016", "title": "mah sing, top glove, fgv, alam maritim, heitech padu,

north sea in the uk. in a bourse filing today, hibiscus said it had agreed to pay the introducer fee to ping upon successful completion of the anasuria cluster acquisition as ping had already achieved

bursa malaysia. meanwhile, bumi armada bhd has filed a suit in australia against woodside energy julimar pty ltd over the termination of its armada claire floating production storage and offloading contract. it told stock exchange today that its unit armada balvanes pte ltd (abpl) has filed its writ of summons in the supreme court of western australia. abpl is seeking a declaration that the

inched up on wednesday, paced by sluggish bank and consumer stocks as investors pondered whether central banks stimulus efforts will be enough to bolster global growth. energy stocks like chevron corp advanced after weekly supply data boosted speculation that a steeper-than-forecasted decline in gasoline supplies will lead to a drawdown in crude oils glut. the s&p 500 index rose 10 points to

shares traded. the index closed at 1,690.91 yesterday, up 4.56 points from the previous day as blue chip stocks like astro malaysia holdings bhd, hong leong financial group bhd, malayan banking bhd, petronas chemicals bhd and umw holdings bhd caused the index to surge on buying activities. the ringgit gained slightly against the us dollar at 4.0960 as brent crude oil rose to us$39.80 (rm163.97) per barrel. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,671.82 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,503.68 (low) and 1,727.41 (high). the indexs decline from 1,867.53 (april 2015) to 1,503.68 (august 2015) was in a perfect 1.62 ratio of the initial down-thrust from the high of 1,896.23 (july 2014) to the 1,671.82 low (december 2014). the subsequent rebound from the 1,503.68 low stalled at the 1,727.41 high, which is also a perfect upward 62% retracement of the 1,867.53 to 1,503.68 move. the indexs next two minor swings comprised a minor low of 1,622.84, which then stalled at the 1,706.25 minor high on dec 30, 2015. its persistent weaker price action in january 2016 was in tandem with the softer tone for global markets and the index troughed at 1,600.92 on jan 21, 2016. the indexs next rebound from the 1,600.92 low surged to a new recent high of 1,710.20 on monday. the indexs daily signals are mainly positive, with its commodity channel index (cci), directional movement index (dmi), oscillator and moving average convergence divergence (macd) indicators showing chart buy signals. as such, the indexs firm support levels are seen at the 1,631, 1,676 and 1,690, while obvious profit-taking at the resistance areas of 1,710, 1,727 and 1,744 may cap any index rebound. the fbm klcis 18-day and 40-day simple moving averages (sma) depict an emerging trend for its short-term daily chart. the indexs price bars are finally above the 50-day and 200-day daily sma, and this depicts a better upward phase for the fbm klci in the medium to longer term too. due to the upbeat tone for the fbm klci, we are recommending a chart buy on guinness anchor bhd (gab). gab produces, packages, markets and distributes beer. a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that nine research houses cover this stock, with nine buy calls. maybank investment bank bhds analyst upgraded gab recently to buy with a discounted cash flow target price of rm15. its six months financial year 2016 (6mfy16) results were above expectations on better-than-expected cost efficiencies, marginally lower tax rates and higher sales. gab declared an interim dividend of 20 sen and a bumper special dividend of 30 sen to commemorate its 50th jubilee. gab remains a defensive stock with an attractive dividend yield of 7.8% (fy16 estimate). gabs chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames are firmly up. from a weekly wave-3 high of rm19.72, its major weekly wave-4 low of rm11.35 was formed in october 2014. since that rm11.35 low, gab rose to its recent march 2016 high of rm14.80. as its price broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of rm13.01 and rm14.46, look to buy gab on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term uptrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, oscillator and stochastic) have issued clear buy signals and now show firm and obvious indications of gabs eventual rise to much higher levels. it would attract firm buying activities at the support levels of rm13.01, rm14.46 and rm14.66. we expect gab to witness some mild profit-taking activities at its resistance levels of rm15.30, rm17.17 and rm19.72. its clear upside targets are located at rm16.18, rm17.50 and rm21.45. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at

in the edge malaysia weekly, on february 15 - 21, 2016.  the recent news that oil and gas major dialog group bhd mutually terminated its small field risk service contract with petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) has sparked concerns about the viability of the other rscs with local oil and gas players. shareholders of petra energy bhd, which is also one of the rsc recipients, however, should have little to worry about. a brief look at the companys earnings in the third quarter ended sept 30, 2015, would be enough to tell that petra energy has already recovered the capital expenditure incurred for the rsc, given that it posted its first profit of rm15.1 million with contributions from its 30% associate company, coastal energy kbm sdn bhd (cekbm). this suggests [that cekbm] has recouped all its capital costs, and the remuneration fee has started to kick in in 3q2015, which was earlier than what management had [initially] guided. therefore, future allocated revenue  70% of kbm cluster fields revenue  will only be used to cover the operating cost, with the remaining sums available to be used to pay remuneration fees to cekbm, states affin hwang capital in a jan 20 research report. petra energy has a 30:70 joint venture with an oil and gas company with assets in thailand  coastal energy co  operating the kapal, beranang and meranti (kbm) cluster under the rsc, which achieved first oil in december 2013 and is currently producing 13,000 barrels per day. reports have indicated that the kbm cluster is estimated to contain recoverable resources of 15 million to 35 million barrels. it is understood that its cumulative production is approaching 10 million barrels. it is noteworthy that the small field rsc for the kbm cluster is for eight years, commencing june 2012. market experts say the estimated production cost at kbm is us$20 per barrel, which indicates that it is still profitable for the joint venture to continue production despite the depressed crude oil prices. last thursday, brent crude traded at us$30.83 per barrel. at its peak in july 2008, the crude oil price was at us$145 per barrel. nevertheless, petra energys success in the oil production and development segment is only one aspect of it bucking the trend. petra energys net profit for the nine months ended sept 30, 2015 (9mfy15), increased 32.3% to rm36.89 million from a year ago. revenue rose to rm449.65 million from rm417 million previously. the higher profit was aided by increased contributions from its rsc project and marine assets segment. petra energys marine assets segment registered a profit of rm7.23 million for 9mfy2015, compared with a loss of rm4.84 million previously. this, says the company in its results notes, was due to the higher utilisation rate of its vessels. currently, the utilisation rate of its vessels is about 50%. market experts say the segment will continue to be profitable as long as the company is able to keep the utilisation rate at above 40%. petra energys services segment saw a decline in revenue and profit in the third quarter due to unrealised foreign exchange losses from its us dollar-denominated borrowings. however, the segments 9mfy2015 profit was higher, at rm23.93 million, compared with rm21.49 million previously. this was due to higher contributions from the hook up, commissioning and top-side major maintenance (huc and tmm) contract from petronas carigali sdn bhd (pcsb), says the company in its notes. according to affin hwang capitals estimates, petra energy has realised only rm880 million worth of orders out of the rm2.5 billion contract from pcsb. the contract was awarded on may 21, 2013, for the provision of huc and tmm services in offshore sabah and sarawak for five years. this (the remaining rm1.62 billion worth of orders) is sufficient to tide the segment over through 2018, even if petra energy fails to win any new contracts, says the research house. however, the research house also highlights that there could be a risk that the rm2.5 billion contract may be deferred due to depressed crude oil prices. we see limited risks in the pan-malaysian order book under normal circumstances as maintenance activities for ageing brownfield facilities are a prerequisite for pcsb to sustain oil production at an optimal level. but, we cannot be so sure now, given the recent plunge in crude oil prices to below us$29 per barrel, it says. that said, petra energys balance sheet looks healthy with its net gearing ratio at only 0.38 times as at sept 30, 2015  one of the lowest in the industry  which will place it in a better position than its peers in withstanding industry headwinds. it is worth noting that all three research houses covering petra energy have buy calls on the stock with an average 12-month target price of rm1.62. petra energys net asset per share of rm1.73 as at sept 30, 2015, is also 51.75% higher than its last thursdays closing share price of rm1.14, translating into a market capitalisation of rm365.88 million. the companys share price has declined 15.44% over a one-year period."}, "103": {"date_posted": "25/2/2016", "title": "tabung haji risks losing rm1.4 bil, says rafizi", "article": " kuala lumpur (feb 25): lembaga tabung haji risks losing up to rm1.4 billion due to its continued investment in a troubled engineering company, a pkr lawmaker said as revelations continue over the fund's questionable business deals. pandan mp rafizi ramli said losses sustained through tabung haji's investment in tabung haji heavy engineering (thhe) could one day affect the amount of dividends to its depositors and its ability to subsidise pilgrimages. rafizi said tabung haji had poured rm1.4 billion in risky investments into thhe, an oil and gas engineering firm formerly known as ramunia holdings berhad, between 2008 and 2015. a large portion of that rm1.4 billion, totalling rm981 million, is in the form of a corporate guarantee from tabung haji to thhe. this financial aid had been declared high risk even by tabung haji's investment risk panel, rafizi said. the rm981 million corporate guarantee was given even though it breached the tabung haji act of 1995, which states that financial assistance may only be given to a subsidiary of the pilgrims' fund, rafizi added. according to documents leaked to pkr, the rm981 million had also been approved by the finance ministry, rafizi said. tabung haji has 8.85 million active depositors, all of whom are malaysian muslims saving up money with the fund to perform the haj. of the remainder of the rm1.4 billion which tabung haji could lose, rm100 million could also come from the fall in share prices of ramunia holdings berhad, which the pilgrims' fund had bought in 2008. it also includes rm275 million in islamic irredeemable cumulative preference shares (icps) issued by thhe and bought by tabung haji after they were not well received by investors, rafizi said. tabung haji had also bought rm50 million worth of sukuk bonds issued by thhe in 2010. added to the rm981 million, these individual investments totalled rm1.4 billion in potential loss, rafizi said. tabung haji's interest in thhe began in 2008 when it was still ramunia, an engineering firm whose share prices had shot up due to rumours that it would be bought by a subsidiary of national oil giant petronas. \"this was also at a time when oil prices were above us$100 per barrel and if the rumours were true, ramunia would be getting a lot of jobs from petronas,\" rafizi said. in 2009 however, ramunia ran into financial troubles and was unable to pay its contractors, causing it to be sued. in 2010, its share prices plunged from a high of rm1.95 in 2008 to 20.5 sen. further trading of its shares was suspended from the stock market. yet tabung haji continued to invest in ramunia and in 2010, when it was rebranded to thhe, became its biggest share holder. tabung haji then bought up rm275 million in icps from thhe. in late 2015, it approved rm981 million in corporate guarantees even though the latters performance was worrying, rafizi said. \"the question is how can tabung haji assure its depositors that this was a worthwhile investment and that thhe can get back on its feet in the next five to eight years at a time when the oil and gas industry has been badly hit?\" this is since thhe is dependent on work in the oil and

malaysia weekly, on february 1 - 7, 2016.  lembaga tabung hajis depleted reserves were brought to the publics attention when a letter from malaysias central bank to the funds top management was leaked to the media last tuesday. the pilgrim funds reserves have been substantially depleted due to the practice of paying bonuses that have exceeded its earnings since 2012. a look at tabung hajis 2014 annual report reveals that in 2012, the fund paid rm2.46 billion in bonuses  at a rate of 8%  to its depositors, although net profit came in at only rm2.15 billion. then in 2014, it did the same, paying out rm3.24 billion to depositors  at a rate of 8.25%  even though it only earned rm2.98 billion (see table 1).  the 8.25% bonus rate in 2014 was the highest since 1998, according to tabung hajis annual reports. interestingly, in the same period, when it obviously dipped into its reserves for the higher payouts, the growth rate of depositors savings exceeded that of its assets. depositors savings doubled between 2010 and 2014 while its net assets expanded by 90.9% (see table 2). the key point is, why did tabung haji continue to pay high dividends [bonuses] when it wasnt supported by [a similar increase in] income growth? asks an economist with a local asset management fund. the point of having reserves is to smooth out fluctuations in returns from year to year. so, save in a good year, run it down in a bad year. but it seems like they have been running it down even in the good years. since reaching a low of 3.25% in 2001, tabung hajis bonus rate has been on an upward trend. in 2005, the bonus rate was 4.5% while in 2010, it increased to 5.5%. to recap, in the leaked bank negara malaysia letter dated dec 23, 2015, governor tan sri dr zeti akhtar aziz reminded tabung haji chairman datuk seri abdul azeez abdul rahim that the fund only had 98 sen of assets for every rm1 in liability. note that section 22 of the tabung haji act says the fund cannot announce dividends and bonuses to its depositors if its assets are worth less than its obligations. bank negara did not stop with that reminder. on the same day, zeti also sent a letter to the minister in charge of islamic affairs, datuk seri jamil khir baharom, to warn him that tabung hajis finances could have a financial impact on the government as depositors savings are guaranteed, according to the tabung haji act. tabung haji has not revealed its financial performance for the year ended dec 31, 2015 (fy2015), but the leaked letter has raised concerns over its ability to pay bonuses to its depositors for fy2015. in response, tabung haji has given the assurance that it can still do so and that depositors savings are intact. the quantum of the bonus payout, however, will depend on the funds fy2015 performance. last year was a challenging one for us but due to our asset allocation strategy and risk management, we have managed to record a good performance, tabung haji ceo tan sri ismee ismail said in a statement following news of the leaked letter. however, tabung haji has to be prepared to face the challenging economic environment in 2016 and in the future so that it becomes more competitive. therefore, we have to take into account the current economic situation in setting bonus rates, added ismee, who took the helm of the pilgrim fund in 2006. according to the statement, the assets and liabilities cited by bank negara in the letter do not take into account the current market value of equity investments under tabung hajis subsidiaries and associate companies as well as its plantation and real estate assets. however, tabung hajis equity investments last year do not look rosy, thanks to the bearish local equity market since the collapse in crude oil prices and slowdown in domestic and external economic growth. the fbm klci fell 3.44% in 2015 while the broader fbm emas came in 2.01% lower. according to bloomberg, tabung hajis largest holdings in malaysian stocks by value are its shares in bimb holdings bhd, followed by sime darby bhd, maxis bhd, th plantations bhd, malakoff corp bhd, petronas chemicals group bhd, ijm corp bhd, and gamuda bhd. besides bimb, in which tabung haji is the largest shareholder with a 52% stake, the fund is also the largest shareholder in th plantations with a 78.82% stake, and holds more than 10% equity interest in malakoff, malaysian resources corp bhd, wct holdings bhd, mct bhd and pelikan international corp bhd. of the funds top 10 stock holdings, only maxis, petronas chemicals and ijm turned in a positive share price performance last year (see table 3). the worst performing stock among the 10 was th plantations, which saw its share price drop 30.5% last year to rm1.16 as at last thursday. th plantations has been hit by the drop in crude palm oil prices since 2011. its earnings more than halved to rm17.9 million in the nine months ended sept 30, 2015 (9mfy2015), from rm38.2 million in the previous corresponding period. tabung haji is also the largest shareholder in th heavy engineering bhd (thhe), a loss-making oil and gas fabrication and construction company. thhes losses widened 54% to rm30.2 million in 9mfy2015, from a net loss of rm19.5 million in the previous corresponding period. the fund is also the largest shareholder of information technology company theta edge bhd  which has been loss-making since 2010  with a 68.7% stake. as at sept 30, 2015, theta edge was still in the red with a net loss of rm6.65 million. besides the funds holdings in public-listed companies, it also invests in real estate. among its real estate holdings are menara th in klccs platinum park, several hotels in saudi arabia, three office buildings in the uk and a grade a office building in melbourne, australia. perhaps the most notable real estate acquisition undertaken by tabung haji recently was its purchase of a 0.64ha parcel in tun razak exchange (trx) from 1malaysia development bhd (1mdb) last year for rm188 million, on which it intends to develop a residential tower. the purchase drew criticism from the public as it was done at 43 times the price paid by 1mdb when the latter acquired the trx land from the federal government. tabung haji chairman azeez later said the fund would sell the land and realise gains, although no deal has been announced to this day. to be fair, the problem with its liabilities outweighing its assets  which pushed its reserves into the red  lies mostly in the fund sustaining its high bonus rates. so unless there is a run on the fund by its depositors, tabung hajis situation should be manageable, says the economist. as long as everybody doesnt try to withdraw all at once, tabung haji should be okay, he adds. there may be no immediate risks but it is always better to be safe than sorry and rein in the numbers before things take a turn for the worse."}, "106": {"date_posted": "27/1/2016", "title": "klci continues positive streak, up

(fy16). both dividends are payable on jan 26, 2016, and will go ex on jan 7. the group said its profit before taxation for the current quarter rose by 165%, mainly due to higher garment revenue and higher other operating income, which was largely contributed by the favourable currency exchange rate. it highlighted the stronger greenback resulted in a 27.5% increase in the segment's revenue, though that was partly offset by a 2.6% fall in revenue from its packaging business. for the first half of its financial year (1hfy16), net profit more than doubled y-o-y to rm37.2 million from rm18.09 million, as revenue rose 15% y-o-y to rm391.16 million from rm339.28 million. going forward, the company expects its garments business to remain its major revenue contributor, which accounted

risen by 8.71% to rm921.621 million and by 3.9% to rm2.658 billion respectively, compared with 3qfy15 and 9mfy15. aeon credit recorded other operating income of rm21.628 million for 3qfy16, mainly from bad debts recovered, commission income from the sale of insurance products, and aeon big loyalty programme's processing fee. ratio of total operating expenses against revenue for the quarter under review stood at 63.3% from the 60.4% seen in the quarter ended nov 20 previously, mainly due to higher allowance for impairment losses on financing receivables. going forward, aeon credit expects to maintain its performance for the financial year ending feb 29, 2016 (fy16), based on the implementation of its business plan. construction and engineering services specialist eversendai

from rm5.69 million, on lower export volume of logs, plywood and particleboard. in its filing with bursa malaysia, the group also attributed the weaker performance to the drop in crude palm oil (cpo) and fresh fruit bunch average price, and higher raw material cost for timber and timber products. revenue for 1qfy16 was down 32.9% y-o-y at rm145.21 million from rm216.27 million. on outlook, subur

saw its net profit jump 70.8% to rm60.18 million in the first quarter ended oct 31, 2015 (1qfy16), from rm35.22 million a year earlier, on higher sales from its malaysian operations and foreign exchange gain. 1qfy16's revenue grew 12.5% to rm612.47 million, from rm544.56 million, its filing to bursa malaysia today showed. vs industry said the improved earnings for the quarter was mainly due to higher sales from its malaysian operations, while it recorded a net foreign exchange gain of rm14.61 million versus rm61,000 in the same period last year. it also declared a first interim single-tier dividend of 1.5 sen per share for the financial year ending july 31, 2016 (fy16), payable on mar 11, 2016. ock group bhd's rights issue with warrants has been oversubscribed by 28.16% at

92.7% to rm54,000, from rm741,000 in the previous year, largely on lower revenue registered by sun media corp sdn bhd (sunmedia), the publisher of the sun newspaper. revenue for the quarter was down 13.23% to rm11.81 million, from rm13.61 million, due to lower advertising income recorded by sun media.  for the six months period (1hfy16), berjaya media sank into red with a net loss of rm951,000, compared with a rm1.98 million net profit in 1hfy15.  this was due to lower revenue and impairment loss on fair value of quoted investments, according to the group's filing with bursa today.  going forward, berjaya media expects it to continue to operate in a competitive business environment, and will continue to focus on improving its advertising revenue.

hiving off scomi stake", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on november 30 - december 6, 2015.  ijm corp bhd is mulling its options for its 7.66% stake in scomi group bhd. the construction giant could sell the block of shares, a source familiar with the company says.  the source adds that while the block of shares has drawn interest from some parties, no decision has been made on what ijm corp will do with it. ijm corps lack of interest could be due to the dampened sentiment since the oil boom ended, which has caused scomis share price to tumble. one of the interested parties looking to buy the 7.66% stake or 119.11 million shares is said to be a group of businessmen that includes datuk kamaluddin abdullah. it is understood that talks between the two parties  ijm corp and the group of businessmen  have been ongoing. there is still time to decide what to do with the stake in scomi; ijm corp has options, the source says. to recap, ijm corps initial plan was to hold as much as 25.08% equity interest to become the controlling shareholder of scomi in a deal valued at rm149.31 million back in 2012. ijm corp took up a 119.11 million share placement or 9.6% of scomi for rm39.31 million or 33 sen per share. in addition, it subscribed for three-year zero coupon redeemable convertible secured bonds with an aggregate nominal value of rm110 million. if ijm corp converts the bonds, it would have about an additional 15.5% in scomi. the bonds held by ijm corp are convertible into new scomi shares at a conversion price of 36.5 sen per share. the bonds mature on feb 5  barely two months from now. scomis shares closed at 20.5 sen last friday, after hitting a low of 14 sen in late august. considering the current price of scomi shares, and the prevailing poor sentiment in the oil and gas sector, the conversion of the debt paper into shares seems unlikely.  given the current weak share price, the logical move for ijm corp is to ask for a cash redemption of the convertible bonds which carry a 10% annual yield. as at end-september, scomi had cash balances of rm236.03 million, with short-term borrowings of rm695.72 million and long-term debt amounting to rm180.10 million. for its six months ended sept 30, scomi registered a net profit of rm14.74 million on the back of rm717.65 million in revenue. it is noteworthy that scomis finance cost for the six months under review was rm18.26 million, close to 124% of its net profit. scomis three main businesses are directly owned oil and gas mud drilling, monorail systems manufacturing held under its 72.33% owned subsidiary scomi engineering bhd, and oil and gas support services housed under its 65.66%-owned unit scomi energy services bhd. both subsidiaries are public listed entities. if kamaluddin were to buy the block in scomi it would strengthen his grip on the company. he and his business partner, shah hakim @ shahzanim bin zain, the ceo of scomi, have a joint 11% stake via kaspadu sdn bhd. the relationship between the two soured in 2012, and ijm corps entry into scomi was seen as a means to prevent kamaluddin and parties acting with him from gaining control of scomi. while it is not clear what happened, kamaluddin is said to have had differences of opinion with shah on the direction of scomi. some of the corporate personalities who rallied behind kamaluddin then and acquired substantial stakes were tan sri abu sahid mohamed, and datuk phillip siew mun chuang. scomi partnered australian outfit cue energy resources ltd, looking to morph into a risk service contractor and develop a marginal oil field for petroliam nasional bhd (petronas), but this did not materialise. a year later, scomis luck improved, and the company, partnering ophir production and vestigo petroleum sdn bhd, a wholly-owned unit of petronas, bagged a small field risk service contract. of late, kamaluddin, who is the son of former prime minister tun abdullah ahmad badawi, has been in the corporate news, surfacing in enra group bhd (formerly known as perduren (m) bhd) with a 36.4% stake. enra is exploring opportunities in the oil and gas sector and has appointed such powerhouses as tan sri shamsul azhar abbas, the former president and ceo of petronas, and datuk anuar ahmad, former executive vice-president of petronas gas and power business, to enras board. will ijm corps divestment plan pave the way for kamaluddin to strengthen his hold on scomi? and subsequently, will the duo from petronas be appointed to scomis board if kamaluddin takes control? while this remains to be seen, one thing is for sure  scomi needs money for the bond redemption. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based

full-year net loss this financial year ending dec 31, 2015 (fy15), after three years of profits, mainly due to higher expenses incurred from the relocation of its automotive manufacturing operations from south africa to botswana. for the nine months period ended sept 30, 2015 (9mfy15), the group reported a net loss of rm18.13 million, compared with a net profit of rm981,000 a year ago, dragged by relocation, training and retrenchment costs, following the relocation of its auto manufacturing activities. revenue fell 4% to rm145.86 million, from rm151.96 million. pasdec's senior vice-president of corporate resources, goh song han, said it would likely take another year for the business to turn around in fy17. goh said the group is also looking to balance its business portfolio between property development and auto manufacturing in the next two to three years. for now, the property segment which accounted for 47% of its revenue in 9mfy15, will remain the main contributor to the groups turnover, while the group waits for the auto manufacturing business in botswana to stabilize. today, pasdec also signed a share subcription agreement with bdc to formalise the group's commitment to invest in botswana. under the joint venture (jv), pasdec will hold a 70% stake in the jv company, pasdec automotive technologies proprietary botswana ltd (pat bw), while bdc will own the

revised its outlook for alam maritim resources bhds rm500 million sukuk to stable from negative, but downgraded its rating to ais from a+is. the downgrade reflects alam maritims weakened business risk profile arising from a tough operating environment for offshore support vessel (osv) providers, said the local rating agency. the groups operating performance has been affected by a decline in contract order book and lower charter rates for its vessels, said marc in a statement yesterday. it added that the rating action affects rm115 million of outstanding sukuk issued under the rated programme. the stable outlook reflects marcs expectation that alam maritim (valuation: 1.5; fundamental: 1.4) will sustain its current financial profile and there will be no significant reduction in the order book from the current level. as at end-june 2015, alam maritims order book stood at rm745.5 million, about 18.6% lower from rm915.8 million as at end-2014. charter rates have also come under pressure, with rates for existing contracts renegotiated lower by between 3% and 10% and for new contracts by up to 20%. these factors notwithstanding, marc views alam maritims established position in the osv segment, with a lengthy operating track record and sizeable fleet of 44 vessels to be supportive of the groups ability to weather the prevailing challenging conditions in the oil and gas sector, said marc. alam maritim remains focused on the malaysian market, with petronas carigali sdn bhd accounting for 44% of the groups total outstanding order book value. nonetheless, no major significant contracts are expected to be awarded by oil majors over the near term and contract renewals have shorter tenures of about six months, the rating agency added. it also noted that for the first half of 2015 (1h15), alam maritims average utilisation rate fell, from 70% to 57% in 2014, in part due to the idling of three vessels which passed the maximum allowable vessel life for petronas projects, while another seven vessels were dry-docked for maintenance. the lower utilisation rate contributed to a sharp decline in operating revenue and pre-tax profit to rm153.2 million and rm19.5 million respectively in 1h15. marc views that demand for alam maritims services will continue to be supported by the existing production activities of the oil and gas sector. alam maritim shares closed down 3.16% to 46 sen yesterday, for a market capitalisation of rm425.25 million. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated

"}, "155": {"date_posted": "11/9/2015", "title": "uzma confident of resilient earnings growth ", "article": " although the low crude oil price environment has seen uzma bhds share price more than halve within a year, the oil and gas service provider is expecting resilient earnings growth for at least three more years. the stock dove 64.87% to a 52-week low of rm1.32 in december last year from a peak of rm3.75 in the same period. it has since regained 26.55% and closed at rm1.71 on aug 28. uzma ceo datuk kamarul redzuan muhamed tells digitaledge weekly that the group is in a safe spot because it is involved mainly in a business that caters for fields in production.  they [oil companies] need to produce regardless [of the price environment] and they probably need to produce more with the drop in prices. so, uzma is in the right kind of market [brownfield services], he says. kamarul acknowledges the dramatic change in the industry over the past three months but he believes uzma can weather the storm that is expected to blow for a while. his confidence stems from the groups order book  which stands at rm2.7 billion and will keep the group busy until 2021  and its ability to provide services to oil companies so that they can produce oil economically. there are basically no activities in exploration at the moment, which is why rig counts are down. the budget for exploration has been slashed but production has to continue and the products that uzma has to offer support existing production. thats why we feel we are slightly different from the others, kamarul remarks. he explains that uzma is not only involved in exploration but also in the provision of services for already producing fields. on top of that, it has recurring income from its chemical business, amongst others, which is in demand as long as production continues. the country needs the production; there is no point in slowing down. if petroliam nasional bhd does not keep up with production, it wont have any money  thats its revenue, says kamarul.  it bears noting that the current market is much more challenging than when uzma got listed in 2008. however, kamarul says the company is doing well and is still looking at 30% to 40% revenue growth in the next three years. uzma (fundamental: 1.10; valuation: 1.80) reported a 7.05% year-on-year increase in net profit to rm9.26 million or 3.44 sen per share in its second quarter ended june 30, 2015 (2qfy2015). revenue, especially from secured long-term contracts, rose 31.45% to rm104.09 million. in the first half of fy2015, the group posted a 1.35% y-o-y increase in net profit to rm17.31 million on revenue that rose 41.28% from the previous corresponding period to rm288.62 million. kamarul sees a stronger second half for the group, thanks to its risk-service contract and d18 water injection facility (wif), among others, which will spill over into fy2016. uzmas revenue growth projection is backed by its contract wins this year. it kicked off the year with a rm50 million contract from petronas carigali sdn bhd for the provision of through tubing downhole tolls and services. it was later awarded a contract for the provision of cased hole electric-line logging perforation and other services for rm59 million. petronas carigali also awarded the group two contracts for the provision of helicopter services in sabah for an aggregated value of rm166.5 million and one for the leasing, operating and maintaining of the d18 wif for the oil company. the latter, which has an estimated value of rm400 million, involves the complete engineering and construction, installation and commissioning of the wif and providing operational and maintenance services. apart from these jobs, uzma also entered into a memorandum of understanding with the east coast economic region development council to develop an integrated offshore supply base in kemaman, terengganu, for the groups use that has a potential investment of rm471.48 million over 15 years. while everybody has been quiet, we have been getting quite a few jobs and all the contracts that we announced recently are related to existing oil production. existing oil is the cheapest to produce and at this point in time, everybody has come to the realisation that things are challenging. our biggest challenge at the moment is margin pressure. not only petronas but everybody else is pushing for lower margins. in the first quarter of this year, everybody was negotiating contracts or renegotiating existing contracts, says kamarul. although he does not state the groups margin, according to the edge research, uzma saw its net margin rise to 8.14% in fy2013 from 7.66% in fy2012. currently, it has a lower rolling 12-month net margin of 6.62%. kamarul points out that uzma goes through three health checks: the health of its bid book, the utilisation of its assets and the value rates of its services. but the problem with rates is that they are going down everywhere. the only way to manage the rates is to actually manage our subcontractors. he sees a healthy bid book after the completion of the groups three acquisitions and the establishment of three new companies last year. the three new companies, which include our rsc, will bring in income this year. these income streams did not exist before. then, we made three acquisitions last year. these six things will spur our growth this year, in 2014, uzma acquired well services (thailand) ltd and mmsvs group holdings ltd for a total of rm95 million. it also took over premier enterprise corp (m) sdn bhd, which is involved in the supply of chemicals for oil recovery, for rm20.60 million. kamarul notes that the group is still in acquisition mode and is looking at a few technology companies to acquire this year. investing in technology-based companies will enable the group to offer efficiency in an environment that is cost-sensitive. when petronas tells us to cut cost, we do, and its because we feel that its a moral obligation. everyone is obligated to share the burden at the moment. what we can do now is to improve our efficiency, renegotiate with our sub-vendors and come up with better technology, says kamarul, adding that although more capital is needed to improve technology-wise, there will be no recurring cost. technology will drive cost down. on uzmas cru00e8me de la cru00e8me project, the tanjung baram rsc in sarawak, the group announced along with its 2qfy2015 results that the first production flowed in june. kamarul says there have been delays, though just by a month or two, in seeing first oil and that the rsc will start contributing to the groups earnings by the end of the year. investors should know that the oil price does not have a bearing on our rent fee for the rsc. our rent fee is fixed regardless of the oil price. so, the risk is on petronas. but cost recovery has a bearing based on how quick capital expenditure and operational expenditure is recovered as that is based on the oil price, kamarul explains. he adds that if the rscs capex and opex are low in the current environment, it can survive. uzma had previously announced a rm100 million capex for its rsc and to date, that is the lowest to be spent on such a project. it [the rsc] is still commercially viable; its just that people are not getting the same rate of returns as us. we are probably still going to get the same rate of returns, regardless of the oil price. to recap, uzmas wholly-owned subsidiary uzma energy venture (sarawak) sdn bhd and eq petroleum developments malaysia sdn bhd in march last year signed a small field rsc with petronas to carry out the development and production for the tanjung baram fields. kamarul sums up that uzma has the capability to produce oil economically, which is what is needed in the current industry environment. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability

where contract awards have been slow against the backdrop of a slowdown in upstream activities. however, the group indicated that it is relatively less impacted as most of its vessels service production platforms which are insulated from capital expenditure cuts. alam maritim is also looking into participating more in the middle eastern market, where activity appears to be more robust. alam maritim currently has two vessels in the middle east on long-term contracts. the group has also recently won a third contract to provide its multipurpose tug vessel, mv setia emas, to a united arab emirates client for a fixed period of three years, with an extension of another two years for rm41 million. petronas carigali sdn bhd has yet to have any call-out for vessels for its umbrella contract. to recap, petronas carigali has earlier awarded an umbrella contract for the provision of spot charters for marine vessels, for which alam maritim was awarded seven of eight packages. we have not factored this in earnings as the contract value is not fixed and will depend on the actual number of days the vessels are on hire, based on a call-out basis by petronas carigali. overall, alam maritim has faced a daily charter rate reduction of 3% to 10% for eight of its vessels with existing contracts, as requested by petroliam nasional bhd (petronas). alam maritim has yet to take delivery of its diving support vessel (dsv), pending the approval of a us dollar loan. this would replace the currently chartered-in vessel, which would subsequently improve margins. the group expects about two dsv contracts to be awarded in the second half of fy15 (2hfy15). we expect a pickup in earnings in the offshore installation and construction (oic) division in 2hfy15, upon the execution of the remainder of the transport and installation contract secured with malaysia marine and heavy engineering holdings bhd and technip geoproduction (m) sdn bhd. furthermore, the segment will also see revenue kicking in in the third quarter ending sept 30, 2015 from the recently won oic contracts, such as subcontract works for petronas floating liquefied natural gas, subsea pipeline replacement for

expanding their business. both macly managing director herman chang and roxy-pacific executive chairman teo hong lim have established themselves as bone fide developers in singapore over the years, and as such come with the experience and resources to develop quality products. they hope to replicate their success here in malaysia. macly group was founded by chang and started developing projects in 1987. to date, it has built, commercial high-rise and cluster housing projects. from 2008 to 2014, the total gross development value (gdv) of its projects amounted to s$1.041 billion. the group also owns and operates hotels under the brand lloyds inn. roxy-pacific holdings was established in 1967 and was listed on the singapore stock exchange on march 12, 2008. it has developed residential and commercial properties and is the owner of grand mercure roxy hotel and other investment projects. between 2004 and 2014, it completed and launched projects with a total gdv of s$2.184 billion. together, the two developers formed joint-venture company macly equity sdn bhd in 2013 to develop their maiden project in kuala lumpur, called the colony. the 1.4-acre project will be situated right next to quill city mall. there is already construction activity on the freehold plot, which was purchased in 2012 for rm90 million. teo says they are laying the foundations of the project first in order to build public confidence that they will deliver the project on time and as promised. being new in town, he believes this is important to establish their reputation, especially since they view kuala lumpur as an important market. kl is one of the key markets we want to expand to, says teo. because singapore is quite dry right now. after making all the money in singapore, we need to establish a second market. the colony, according to chang, is the brand name of the project, which is used for marketing purposes. but the actual name of the structure being built is wisma infinitum. both gentlemen believe their rm800 million project will appeal to homebuyers and investors alike, thanks to its neighbour quill city mall. but chang highlights two more reasons the colony is an attractive proposition. it is an eight-minute walk to the medan tuanku monorail station, which is linked to major areas in the city centre as well as kuala lumpur sentral, and close to the retail strip of jalan bukit bintang. chang and teo also recognise that smaller sized units in city centres are currently in demand simply because of the price factor. with this in mind and their experience in building small yet liveable units, the colony will offer 723 compact dual-key small offices/home offices units that will offer buyers various options for how they wish to use their unit. chang says a homeowner can live in one side of the unit and rent out the other side for passive income. or the space can be used as an office. the units will be spread across two towers. tower a is 35 storeys with 423 units, while tower b will be 43 storeys with 300 units. the built-ups will range from 675 sq ft to 1,180 sq ft. the facilities include a swimming pool that looks out toward the petronas twin towers, an outdoor dining area with barbecue, a residents lounge and a gym. tower a will be launched first sometime in september, while tower b will be launched at a later date. the target market is investors and young working adults in their 30s who do not have a family yet and like living in the city. the tower a units range from 705 to 1,155 sq ft, with most of the units in the 705 to 945 sq ft range. the average selling price is rm1,380 psf and the estimated gross rental yield is between 5.5% and 6%. the maintenance fee is about 40 sen psf. we compare ourselves to other developments in klcc [kuala lumpur city centre], and we find ours is the most compact in size, says chang. we are compacting the size of the units to achieve higher per sq ft yield. that means we are making your per sq ft work harder for you on two fronts. one, because it is an efficient design and very useable. two, it is dual key. and yet for the selling price, we have done a study, and i think we have the most competitive pricing in the klcc area. designing small units is not new to chang as he was among the first to do so in singapore. i am one of the pioneers of the shoebox apartment in singapore. so i am used to designing compact spaces, he says. the shoebox concept featured in macly groups mackenzie 138 project, which offered 35 apartments in mackenzie road, singapore. according to chang, the smallest units built-up is 409 sq ft, while the average built-up in the project is 450 sq ft. the singapore government defines a shoebox unit as one that is below 500 sq ft. incidentally, the project was sold out within a month in 2004. the colony units have bathrooms in both dual-key spaces and there is a washing machine niche, chang says. they also come with kitchen cabinets, hob and hood, sink and tap, bathroom fittings, water heater and air-conditioning units. to facilitate buyer needs, the developer is offering two packages for sale. the first is the semi-furnished package in which curtains and lights will be done for the buyer, leaving them with the option to buy their own loose furniture. the second option is the fully furnished fit out package in which everything is done for the buyer, including buying the loose furniture, making the unit move-in ready. the prices of the packages will range from around rm50,000 to rm100,000 while the project looks promising, it does come at a challenging time. according to research consultancy dtzs property times kuala lumpur 2q2015 report, smaller-sized apartments with built-ups of less than 1,000 sq ft are expected to do better than those with a larger built-up due to budget constraints, but there is a large supply of small unit apartment projects in the pipeline that is expected to moderate demand. so, how will the colony compete in such a market? there is differentiation in the colony  it has compact and dual-key units, teo explains. if we are working on the same regular product as a local developer, it is not easy for us to compete in the market. it is a calculated risk [with our design] because we dont want to be foolish and do something very crazy that the local market cannot take. so based on our judgement, our product does have its differentiation. it is not purely on price. price cannot be the only factor. besides the substantial residential offering, the colony also has a retail component over three levels. there are 31 lots with a net lettable area of 36,000 sq ft. there are no plans to sell the lots, although details of what will be in the space are still under discussion. chang and teo are considering the possibility of finding a management company to manage the retail area. while it seems strange to provide retail lots when the colony is situated right next to quill city mall, chang says the retailers in the colony will complement rather than compete against the huge shopping centre. a strong partnership the colony is chang and teos first project together in malaysia, but they have forged a strong partnership over the years. their individual companies have operated successfully over the years and they would have been happy to continue on their merry way if not for the 2007 lehman brothers collapse that brought them together. we didnt get hit badly [then] but we thought that post-lehman, we had to reinvent ourselves u2026 a few of us developers said we should sometimes join forces and work together, share our ideas, to reinvent the wheel, and at the same time pool our resources, teo explains. so it was a natural progression that brought a few developers like us to the next stage. the partnership has so far been a pleasant experience for both parties. in a partnership you need to enjoy the journey together, rather than you guard against your partner. i think this is very important because we both believe in working hard, dont be funny with each other or take advantage of each other. so it is very enjoyable working together, says chang, who trained as a civil engineer. the first project they worked on together was haig 162 on haig road in singapore. this 16-storey high-rise offered 99 units. it was a good collaboration; we sold 99% of the units in a few hours, recalls teo with a smile. he is a chartered accountant by training. to ensure that both parties continue to remain happy working together, they have structured their joint-venture companies a little differently from the usual 51:49 ratio. for example, for macly equity sdn bhd, macly group holds 48%, roxy-pacific, 47% and a friendly real estate third party familiar with the two gentlemen the remaining 5%. this tripartite structure was instituted to ensure that no one would lose out in the end. in a structure of 51:49, nobody is thinking, chang says. the company with 51% will say, im dominating, i dont want to think, because i will sure win any matter. the 49% will say, i will sure lose, so i dont want to think, since you have 51%, you do the thinking. in the end, nobody is thinking. so our joint venture is always like this, two dominant parties and then an in-between party, a real estate person who can potentially mediate if the need arises. so far, they have not had to utilise this mediation function as they have been able to iron out any issues amicably. teo also highlights that this agreement protects both parties in case something happens to either one. we could be very good friends and we proceed along that line, but what happens if something happens to me and somebody takes over and starts to be unreasonable? teo explains. at least the common party in between us are reasonable people and mutual friends who will take the side of the guy that is working for the good of the company. we dont want to end up with a deadlock. as both chang and teo work at establishing themselves in kuala lumpur, they are also looking forward to working together on another jv project in malaysia, this time in balakong. plans are still being finalised but the six-acre plot is looking to have a mixed-use layout with residential and commercial components. while the two partners continue their fine relationship, they also have individual projects that their respective companies are embarking on. with a keen focus on doing a good job and not getting into any funny business, this partnership may very well be a long and fruitful one. this article first appeared in

tax allowance granted for the plant rejuvenation and revamp project that was recognised in the second quarter of financial year 2015 (2qfy15) is a one-off item. there is no further major tax incentives (apart from the tax exemption for the utilities segment). we also understand that the sharp drop in associate and joint venture (jv) income in 2qfy15 (rm3.3 million versus rm23.8 million in 1qfy15 was mainly due to kimanis, which was negatively impacted by an unrealised loss from the revaluation of long-term forex contracts. their utilities segment was also impacted by a plant shutdown. the 1.7% year-on-year (y-o-y) contraction in 2qfy15 revenue was mostly due to lower sales booked by utilities. the segments sales fell by rm26.1 million compared with 2qfy15. apart from the impact of lower electricity tariff, the segment was negatively impacted by plant shutdowns, resulting in lower off-take of industrial gases. management indicated that it is just regular planned maintenance shutdowns. no further maintenance shutdowns are planned in the second half (2hfy15). management expects utilities sales to play catch-up in the remainder of the year. pgbs throughput services also benefited from the higher base income. in 1hfy15, the gas processing revenue rose 4.3%, thanks to higher capacity reservation fee under the new gas processing agreement, which came into effect on april 1, 2014. we understand that the group also managed to achieve the overall equipment effectiveness target for two months in 2qfy15, resulting in it being able to claim the pbs incentives. coupled with lower cost, gross profit of this segment rose 14.5% y-o-y in 1hfy15. meanwhile, the gas transportation segment booked a 4% y-o-y increase in 1hfy15 revenue, benefiting from higher capacity booking under the new gas transportation agreement. the incremental revenue added rm19 million to the groups gross profit. fy15 earnings estimate upgraded 22% after imputing the rm407.4 million dta recognised in 2qfy15. fy16 and fy17 earnings forecasts were upgraded 0.9% and 1.2% respectively, to take into account the better- than-expected contribution from the gas transportation segment. with the improved cash flow on the back of a lower tax burden, the fy15 dividend estimate adjusted higher to 65 sen per share (59% payout ratio). we have also rolled forward the valuation base year to fy16

us$63 (rm230) now, petronas dagangan bhd, the countrys largest petrol station operator, needs to adopt a jit inventory strategy to sustain its profit margin. petronas dagangan chief executive officer (ceo) and managing director mohd ibrahimnuddin mohd yunus notes that it is crucial to look for the optimal inventory level to make sure that its retailing segment does not keep too much stock as the possibility of a further fall on oil prices lurks. we order our supplies at the right moment and right time to ensure our stocks are not too high if theres a plunge in oil prices in the future, ibrahimnuddin explained to 180 students at the edge billion ringgit club meet the ceo event at the kdu university college glenmarie campus last friday. meanwhile you have got to be very careful because you dont want to disappoint your customers to a point that theres no stock in your retail store, he said, adding that the company also needs to ensure the efficiency of its supply and distribution. in fact, petronas dagangan, the marketing arm of national oil major petroliam nasional bhd (petronas), has slashed its operating costs and ensured its inventory to be at the optimum level to stay profitable. in light of the low oil prices, ibrahimnuddin said petronas dagangan has cut its operating costs by 30% to stay resilient. this (the dip in oil prices) has an adverse effect on our margins, he says, adding that the bulk of the companys earnings are from the retail business. he acknowledged that it was a difficult time for petronas dagangan during the fourth quarter of financial year 2014 ended december (4qfy14). when that (drastic fall of crude oil prices) happened, we lost a lot of money. normally, we register [quarterly] profit between rm150 million and rm200 million every quarter. for the fourth quarter of 2014, we were really lucky that we managed to make some profit. net profit for 4qfy14 plunged 99.7% year-on-year to rm445,000 from rm151.32 million. revenue came in 11% lower at rm7.45 billion from rm8.39 billion a year earlier. earnings per share fell to 0.04 sen from 15.2 sen a year ago. the deterioration of its 4qfy14 results was mainly because of the decrease in sales volume and average selling price, petronas dagangan explained in its results note. for the full fy14, petronas dagangans net profit slumped to rm501.57 million from rm811.75 million the year before, although its revenue was flat at rm32.34 billion. on its product primax 95 with advanced energy formula, ibrahimnuddin highlighted that it was developed from the formula one track. we have lewis hamilton as our technical professional consultant and he gave us input for his car to perform better for every race. the fuel that made him [hamilton] the world champion came from us, he said. with the theme managing new realities, ibrahimnuddin, 51, attracted some 180 students to the event organised by the edge communications sdn bhd. ibrahimnuddin has been with petronas for 26 years. his experience cuts across many fields, from public affairs to oil and gas marketing and trading, as well as human resources. he took over the helm of petronas dagangan in february last year. ibrahimnuddin reveals that the shared values in petronas dagangan are clip, which are cohesiveness, loyalty, integrity and professionalism. responding to a question on how he overcame the challenges during his tenure with petronas, ibrahimuddin said, in my journey to become a ceo, i have failed many times but [i] do not give up. his advice students is to know your target, focus on execution, and always think positively. ibrahimnuddin said the most important thing in managing new realities is actually to make changes. if you are static, and people are going to change, you will be left behind. petronas dagangan has four core businesses  retail (sold in petrol stations), commercial (supply of diesel, jet fuel and so on.), liquefied petroleum gas and lubricants. it owns over

or 5.4 sen per share in 1qfy15, from rm139.72 million or 5 sen per share a year ago, as it benefited from lower fuel expenses and a gain on disposal of interest in airasia expedia travel. airasias revenue fell by a marginal 0.4% to rm1.297 billion in 1qfy15, compared with rm1.302 billion in 1qfy14. the airline attributed the lower quarterly revenue to average fare falling by 9%, despite a 3% increase in passenger volume, which was partially contributed by the overall improvement in passenger volume from china. malayan banking bhd (maybank) reported a 6% rise in first quarter net profit from a year earlier, as interest and islamic banking income grew. higher insurance income also supported bottom line growth. in a statement to bursa malaysia, maybank (fundamental: 1.5; valuation:

fee income of rm151.9 million. genting malaysia bhds net profit grew a marginal 1% to rm362.10 million in the first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1qfy15), from rm358.29 million a year ago, mainly due

us operations, including resorts world bimini (bimini) in the bahamas, improved by 22% to rm313.8 million, largely contributed by higher volumes of business from the resorts world casino new york city (rwnyc) and bimini operations. its uk business revenue, however, fell 7% to rm355.7 million, mainly due to lower hold percentage and volume of business in its international markets division, which cater to the premium players business. goldis bhds net profit jumped 71% on-year to rm33.39 million or 5.49 sen per share for its first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1qfy15), from rm19.56 million or

of service apartments at g residence, which achieved over 93% in sales with a value of rm157 million, said goldis (fundamental: 0.5; valuation: 1.1). karex bhd saw its net profit rise 31.8% to rm15.21 million or 2.45 sen a share for the third financial quarter ended march 31, 2015 (3qfy15), from rm11.54 million or 1.9 sen a share a year earlier, on sales of higher profit margin products, favourable currency exchange rates and lower raw material prices. revenue, however, was 4.3% lower at rm71.4 million, from rm74.62 million in 3qfy14, due to higher commercial orders received in the current quarter, resulting in longer lead time for production. the condom manufacturer's cumulative nine months (9mfy15) net profit increased to rm42.59 million or 6.96 sen a share, a 90.3% increase from rm22.38 million or 5.5 sen a share a year ago; while revenue also increased by 39.4% at rm218.53 million, from rm156.79 million in 9mfy14. in a filing with bursa, karex said demand for condoms remains

healthcare bhds net profit increased 7.8% to rm171.48 million or 2.1 sen per share in the first quarter ended march 31 (1qfy15), from rm159.05 million or 1.96 sen per share in the previous

billion in 1qfy15, compared to rm1.76 billion in the first quarter of financial year 2014 (1qfy14). the company said the improved earnings were primarily driven by higher inpatient admission, overall revenue intensities and the ramp up of operations of acibadem atakent hospital in turkey, as well as pantai hospital manjung in malaysia  both of which opened in 2014. ihh healthcare also said the group reaped the benefits of its diversified operations across 10 countries, as a strong singapore dollar helped to offset the translational loss of a weak lira to the groups reporting currency, the

director lim chai beng said the group is currently bidding for 10 palm oil mill projects, worth some rm10 million to rm70 million each, with most of the projects located overseas, from indonesia to

long-term debt ratings to negative, from stable. in a statement, ram's consumer and industrial ratings head kevin lim said the negative outlook on tan chong (fundamental: 0.55; valuation: 2), which distributes nissan cars in malaysia, was due to the company's cash flow-protection measures and profit margin concerns. the revision of the outlook is premised on rams concern that the groups cashflow-protection measures and margins will remain pressured by intense competition in the automotive industry and the weak ringgit, amidst dampening demand post-implementation of the gst. engineering and construction services provider kimlun corp bhds net profit for the first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1qfy15) was down 25.6% to rm14.12 million or 4.7 sen per share, from rm18.97 million or 7.02 sen per share a year ago, primarily due to gains made from land disposal in 1qfy14. its revenue in 1qfy15 had also dipped 3.2% to rm322.17 million, from rm332.69 million in 1qfy14. kimlun (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 2.4) said if contribution of the disposals is removed, the group would have achieved a growth in revenue and gross profit of 12.6% and 34.6% respectively in the current quarter, as compared to 1qfy14.\n\nthe construction divisions revenue, which improved by 14% with a few large projects secured, continued to be the main revenue contributor to the group  making up 84% of the current quarters revenue. perwaja holdings bhd saw its net loss for the three months ended march 31, 2015 at rm119.57 million, on zero production and low sales volume. it told bursa that its financial year end has been changed to june 30, from dec 31, to cover the 18-month period from jan 1, 2013 to june 30, 2014, hence there is no corresponding quarter for comparison. perwaja said within the current quarter under review, the group reported a revenue of rm200,000, mainly due to zero production and low sales volume. the zero production was affected by the gas and electricity supply curtailment by petronas and tnb, at the material time, which had caused perwajas unit perwaja steel sdn bhd (pssb)'s to be unable to secure the necessary working capital for resumption of production. for the cumulative nine months ended march 31, the group's net loss was at rm233.72 million. dominant enterprise bhd (deb) has proposed a twin-bonus for shareholder: a bonus issue of some 27.5 million new shares, on the basis of one bonus share for every five shares held by its shareholders, together with the issuance of 45.8 million free warrants to accompany the bonus issue, on the basis of one warrant for every three existing shares held. deb (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 3.0) said the entitlement date for the issuances will be determined at a later date.

lower net profit was despite a 16% increase in revenue to rm143.63 million, from rm123.74 million in the previous year. the group proposed a single-tier final dividend payment of one sen per share for fy15, bringing its total dividend payment per share to five sen for the year. full year net profit fell 3% year-on-year to rm22.43 million, from rm23.13 million; while revenue rose 15% to rm547.61 million, from rm477.73 million. deb said its manufacturing division had posted lower operating profit of rm1.86 million in 4qfy15, despite an increase in revenue, market share expansion and newly-developed products. lion corp bhd saw its net loss widen 14% to rm105.93 million for its third quarter ended march 31, 2015 (3qfy15), from a net loss of rm92.88 million a year before, as revenue dipped 6.6% to rm571.47 million, from rm611.93 million. for its nine months ended march 31 (9mfy15), lion corps net loss deteriorated 40% to rm315.17 million, from rm224.90 million in 9mfy14. revenue meanwhile, declined 9% to rm1.65 billion, from rm1.82 billion during the same period, its filing to bursa showed. the practice note 17 (pn17) company said its weaker 9mfy15 performance was due to sluggish demand for flat steel products in both the domestic and overseas market, and a foreign exchange loss of rm47 million resulting from the strengthening of the us dollar against the ringgit. the group said dumping activities by foreign millers remain rampant and that the group continues to run its plants at low production capacity, which caused it to incur losses for the quarter under review. genting bhds net profit for the first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1qfy15) went up 24.6% to rm620.1 million, from rm497.5 million, partly driven by gains on the disposal of financial assets. revenue however, dipped 6.9% to rm4.37 billion, from rm4.69 billion in 1qfy14, its filing to bursa showed. genting (fundamental: 2.1: valuation: 0.8) saw lower revenues from resorts world sentosa (rws) both

valuation: 1.5) said was due to higher revenue from project division of kitchen and wardrobe segment and manufacturing of glass and aluminium products. signature proposed a first interim dividend of four sen per share for fy15, payable on july 2, 2015. for the nine-month period (9mfy15), signature posted a net profit of rm32.25 million or 26.9 sen per share, up 256% from rm9.06 million or 7.6 sen per share on higher revenue and margins. revenue rose 95% to rm217.97 million from rm111.83 million in 9mfy14. project division of kitchen and wardrobe segment has been the main contributor to the increase. boustead holdings bhd's net profit for the first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1qfy15) has plunged 99.8% to rm100,000 or 0.01 sen per share from rm56.4 million or 5.45 sen per share a year ago, on lower revenue. revenue was down 24.3% to rm1.89 billion from rm2.499 billion in 1qfy14, its filing to bursa malaysia today showed. despite the weaker financials, boustead (fundamental: 0.65; valuation: 2) declared its first interim dividend of 5 sen per share in 1qfy15, which will be paid on june 30, 2015. in a media statement, boustead deputy chairman and group managing director tan sri lodin wok kamaruddin said 1qfy15 has been a challenging period as external pressures and a general 'wait-and-see' mood in the consumer market is definitely bearing down on the group's earnings. segmentally, boustead's plantation revenue registered an 80% slump in pre-tax profit and a 32.4% drop in revenue, which the group blamed on declining fresh fruit bunch (ffb) production (down 16%) and bearish palm product prices. carlsberg brewery malaysia bhd's (fundamental: 2.3; valuation: 2.1) net profit fell 9.8% to rm47.23 million or 15.45 sen per share in the first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1qfy15) from rm52.33 million or 17.12 sen a year ago, as customers opted to maintain minimal stocks ahead of the goods and services tax (gst) implementation. revenue dropped 3.7% to rm429.45 million in 1qfy15 from rm445.94 million in 1qfy14. felda global ventures holdings bhd (fgv) (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 1.4) ventured into the philippines markets to supply its premier oil palm seeds to planters in mindanao. in a statement, fgv said its subsidiary felda agriculture services sdn bhd (fassb) has signed a memorandum of collaboration with bali oil palm produce corporation (boppc) to explore the possibility of collaborating with each other in agricultural related products and services. according to fgv, fassb is committed to deliver the first oil palm seeds to philippine coconut authority (pca) and boppc in 2015. fassb will deliver 110,000 dxp oil palm germinated seeds to pca and one million dxp oil palm germinated seeds to boppc commencing june 2015, fgv said. fgv also believes the collaboration will be a springboard for mindanao to become one of the major world-class palm oil exporters together with fgv and other world's top producer. snacks and candies manufacturer cocoaland holdings bhd said it has decided to reject navis asia fund vii, lp's takeover offer of rm377.52 million or rm2.20 per share. in a statement to the bourse today, cocoaland said its board of directors have deliberated on the proposed acquisition by navis asia vii management company ltd, who made the offer on behalf of navis asia fund vii, and \"unanimously rejected the offer\". \"the offer price for the proposed acquisition was rm377.52 million (rm2.20 per share),\" it added. last friday, cocoaland (fundamental: 2.5;

it will resume trading tomorrow. separately, cocoaland saw its net profit more than double to rm8.01 million or 4.67 sen per share for the quarter ended mar 31, 2015 (1qfy15) from rm3.41 million or 1.99 sen per share a year ago, mainly on increased trading volume from its contract manufacturing of hard candy production. revenue grew only 14.32% to rm67.74 million in 1qfy15 from rm59.25 million last year, but lower advertisement expense incurred and lower impairment of receivables also facilitated better profit margin for the group, the filing showed.

sticking with aet", "article": " last friday, state-owned misc bhd finally laid to rest all the speculation that it was looking to sell its wholly-owned subsidiary aet tanker holdings sdn bhd, a leading petroleum vessel operator in the us gulf coast, to teekay tankers ltd. the shipping company broke its silence after a week, saying, in response to recent market speculation, misc confirms that petroleum shipping is a core element of its current and ongoing business and, as such, has no plans to divest itself of its petroleum tanker subsidiary, referring to the rumoured sale of aet. this response  much clearer than the one issued earlier in the week that misc is not in a position to comment on teekays business plans  should put an end to the speculation. nevertheless, miscs shares, which have been climbing steadily since early 2013, soared to a record high of rm9.35 last friday from rm7.20 in january  up nearly 30% year to date. the excitement could have been created by the over us$2 billion price tag on aets fleet of 72 tankers, according to online platform vesselsvalue.com. had the sale materialised at this estimated price, more than rm7 billion cash or rm1.57 per share would have been added to miscs coffers. a shipping industry veteran acknowledges that he had heard that teekay was looking at aet. teekay is a well-run company, its management is good and it could be looking to beef up its fleet, he says, adding though that he was not sure if misc was interested in selling. aet chief executive hor weng yew was quoted by the media as saying, industry participants talk about mergers and acquisitions all the time but one shouldnt believe in rumours. he said aet was continuously renewing its fleet. financial returns have picked up for tanker owners and operators globally in recent months but the outlook is still not conducive for investing in fleet expansion. earnings have improved but from the investment perspective for the long term, they are still not good enough, hor was quoted by energy and metals information provider platts as saying on the sidelines of an international oil pollution conference organised by singapores maritime and port authority. nevertheless, rumours of aet being up for sale are not surprising, considering miscs penchant for asset disposal and the difficult environment in which aet is operating. indeed, aet posted losses in its financial year ended dec 31, 2012 (fy2012) and fy2013. it suffered an after-tax loss of rm555.8 million on revenue of rm2.5 billion in fy2013. its financial performance was almost identical the year before  an after-tax loss of rm553.6 million on revenue of rm2.6 billion. as at dec 31, 2013, aet had non-current assets of rm9.4 billion and current assets of almost rm1.2 billion. long-term liabilities stood at rm5.6 billion while short-term debt commitments amounted to rm711.2 million. looking at aets financial performance, it actually makes sense to sell the company. an analyst with a local brokerage firm offers a possible reason for misc to hive off aet  a weak lightering market in the us, which is key to the latter. lightering is the transfer of cargo  in this case, oil  to a facility onshore from a small vessel. an example would be an aframax tanker removing cargo from a very large crude carrier (vlcc). of aets 72 vessels, 48 are aframax tankers that are usually involved in lightering. in the us, the louisiana offshore oil port is the only facility at which a vlcc can berth, so lightering is needed to transport crude oil to the onshore refineries. aet has been a victim of the contraction in the us oil imports in recent years, due partly to the development of unconventional energy  shale gas, of which the worlds largest economy has ample supply. data from the energy information administration (eia) indicates that the us imported 9.2 million barrels of crude oil per day in 2010 but only 7.3 million per day last year  down almost 21%. according to eia, 27% of the petroleum consumed by the us was imported last year, the lowest level since 1985. petroleum includes crude oil and gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, jet fuel, chemical feedstock, asphalt, biofuel (ethanol and biodiesel) and other products. while teekay has also been adversely affected by the lower oil imports of the us, it posted a net profit of us$33.9 million on revenue of us$235.6 million in fy2014. as at dec 31, 2014, teekay had us$162.8 million in cash, which means it would have borrowed heavily to acquire aet. in terms of fleet size, teekay is smaller with a fleet of 32 vessels. the acquisition of aet would have expanded its fleet substantially  by about three times. in fact, in 2003, when misc purchased aet for us$445 million, the latters fleet size was the same as teekays. on top of that, misc funded a us$75 million dividend from aet to neptune orient lines, the company that had owned aet. later, misc transferred its crude petroleum tanker assets to aet, expanding the latters fleet to more than 50 vessels and forming assets worth in excess of us$2 billion. had misc sold aet, its fleet would have been reduced to about 60 ships, almost half of them liquefied natural gas (lng) tankers and a quarter of them offshore floating facilities. in fy2014 ended dec 31, misc registered a net profit of rm2.2 billion on almost rm9.3 billion in sales. its energy-related shipping division accounted for 67% or rm6.23 billion of the groups revenue and 81% of its operating profit of rm1.84 billion. for some analysts, misc without aet, and only its lng tankers and 66.5%-owned fabricator malaysia marine and heavy engineering bhd (mmhe), would be unexciting, considering that the latter is not performing well. mmhe has been dogged by a lack of jobs, which is surprising, considering that misc is 62.7%-controlled by national oil company petroliam nasional bhd (petronas). in its final quarter of 2014, mmhe registered a meagre profit of rm16.5 million on revenue of rm508.3 million. mmhe is not competitive, so while its parent (petronas) gives it jobs, this is not often or consistent enough, says an analyst. miscs management would also have to be more aggressive and proactive if it did sell aet. misc is lethargic and was slow to exit the container business u2026 it left at the end of 2011 but container shipping was already in a downturn

supply vessel market due to lower crude oil prices may impact perdanas earnings. but he pointed out that the impact is industry-wide and not unique to perdana. thus far, the group has agreed to provide discounts in one or two of its charter contracts, which ling said perdana had more or less recouped most of its investments. however, the group may find it difficult to provide discounts for newly secured charter contracts as the investment recoupment is huge, according to ling. they (petronas) ask us to reduce the rates a lot, [but it is] very difficult because we have invested big money

revenue contracted 20% to rm69.5 million, compared with rm87.3 million a year ago. in a filing with bursa malaysia yesterday, the group said the steady decline in profits and revenue was due to lower vessel utilisation from the slower work orders and contract awards from the oil majors caused by the low crude oil price. on dayangs equity stake, last week, dayang (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 2.1)

state have been on a steady uptrend. cahya mata sarawak bhds (cms) share price is hovering at a record high currently. the stock had risen from a low of rm3.35 in mid-december last year to rm4.96 last thursday. cms associate company, kkb engineering bhd (fundamental: 2.5; valuation: 1.4), has also seen keen interest of late. its share price has gained 23% in the past fortnight, giving it a market capitalisation of rm435.7 million. from rm1.37 on april 2, the stock rose to rm1.69 on april 15. trading volume has picked up as well with 1.3 million shares traded on april 15 compared with 88,900 shares on april 1. analysts say apart from the election theme, the rise in kkbs share price could be due to the expectation that the company would be a beneficiary of cmsrecently awarded rm308 million contract to build a world-class museum and heritage trail in kuching. cms (fundamental: 3; valuation: 1.1) is a major shareholder in kkb with a 20.1% stake. only sarawaks polls are held at a different time from the general election. the 10th sarawak election was in april 2011. the cms contract could signal the start of more projects to come, ahead of the impending state election. as we noted earlier, there is a possibility that cms will subcontract some jobs to kkb, insofar as they relate to steel fabrication and supply of pipes, says amresearch analyst thomas soon, who tracks sarawak-based companies. on the museum contract, maybank investment bank research, in an april 15 report, states that it represents cms first major construction job win since 2009, lifting its order book by a significant 51% to an estimated rm908 million. the research house points out that this could be a prelude to more construction job wins for cms in the near term, especially works related to the pan-borneo highway and sarawak corridor of renewable energy (score). meanwhile, its cement and construction material businesses are key beneficiaries of the growing construction activities, driven by the upcoming state election, the pan-borneo highway and the 11th malaysia plan, it adds. while the awarding of infrastructure jobs in sarawak is picking up, analysts say the macro operating landscape continues to be tough for companies there, and kkb is no exception. kkb has seen a slowdown in its conventional steel fabrication/engineering business, and the operating landscape remains challenging. its prospects will largely hinge on its oil and gas venture, through its associate oceanmight sdn bhd, which has the expertise and capacity, says soon. despite a tougher operating environment for oil and gas companies, we still expect them (kkbs associate) to get projects from petronas. they are now finishing their rm20 million maiden project. it has not been plain sailing for kkb all these years. its 43%-owned associate oceanmight became a petronas-licensed fabricator in 2013. being the only fabricator in sarawak, it was expected to stand a better chance of landing jobs than players from the peninsula, but so far it has yet to generate any major contribution. the sharp fall in crude oil prices, which is causing a slowdown in the oil and gas sector, has not helped matters either. kkb started diversifying, which includes its venture into the oil and gas sector, as it has a long-term plan to move up the value chain in structural steel fabrication. apart from its core steel fabrication business, it is into civil construction as well as the manufacture of steel pipes and liquefied petroleum gas cylinders.  over the years, kkbs margins have been declining, from 44.11% in 2010 to 28.57% last year. its earnings have been on a downward trend as well. for the financial year ended dec 31, 2014, kkb saw its net profit drop almost 32% year on year to rm23.9 million. likewise, its gross dividend per share decreased from 17.5 sen in fy2010 to only four sen in fy2014. even so, the group saw its cash triple to rm98.6 million as at dec 31, 2014, from rm37.5 million a year earlier. amresearchs soon observes that there has been a decline in large investments in samalaju industrial park, a score hub that front-loaded investments for the major engineering projects. what are left now are piping jobs that have lower margins compared with engineering. however, there are other growth nodes within score that can still bring in jobs, he says. what we need to see that will help companies like kkb is a step-up in rural infrastructure work in sarawak. the pan-borneo highway will help as it will be spread out evenly among companies, including privately owned entities. we do not expect just one major player to get a chunk of it. in a feb 18 report, amresearch notes thatkkbs unbilled sales stand at rm105 million, which would last nine months. it adds that kkb has bid for rm47 million worth of conventional (steel structure/engineering) jobs, over and above its earlier bids of rm130 million. we are assuming new orders of rm250 million, rm280 million and rm300 million over the next three years, says the research house, which has a buy call on the stock, with a fair value of rm2.05. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys

out that perdana currently has five workbarges and a workboat deployed to dayang on long-term charters. the control of perdana would give dayang better access to perdanas young fleet of 19 vessels, of which 17 are in operation and two are due for delivery in financial year 2016 (fy16), it said. meanwhile, kenanga research noted that it is no secret that dayang intends to take perdana private. this is due to the more compelling valuation of perdana following the crude oil price slump while synergistic benefits can also be achieved with perdanas fleet of vessels complementing dayangs hook-up and commissioning (huc) capabilities. we believe the deal could put dayang in a better position to target a bigger slice of the next round of the pan malaysia huc umbrella contract (possibly worth rm10

having a focus on military ship construction. bhic (fundamental: 0.45; valuation: 1.8) is currently negotiating an order to build three osvs. remaining tight lipped on the possible deal, bhic executive deputy chairman and managing director tan sri ahmad ramli mohd nor said bhic, of which the armed forces board fund is the largest indirect shareholder, will be designing and building its first osv with full local content. there are a lot of osvs operated by local companies; now we have been tasked by the government to really improve on our status in the design and engineering of the vessel. we have worked on a design and it is acceptable by petronas (petroliam nasional bhd), he told a press conference after the companys annual general meeting yesterday. when asked about the prospects for its fabrication segment that caters mainly to the oil and gas industry, ahmad ramli said there are still fabrication works for grabs, despite a slowdown in the sector. according to bhic executive director david berry, there are some replenishment to be done on certain existing offshore sites. its not just for new build on new site, some of the old sites are at a point where they need some refurbishments or replacements. what the oil majors have done is cut down on new spend for capital expenditure but they dont necessarily want to cut back on existing production, said berry. ahmad ramli noted that petronas has a few fabrication-related tenders in the pipeline and bhic is actively pursuing these contracts. meanwhile, he highlighted that bhics current focus now is on its military shipbuilding capabilities as the company had a bitter experience in commercial shipbuilding in 2008. but we cant completely ignore commercial. we are smarter now. we only work on projects that are niche in an area and that we know we can control cost and the risk is minimal. hopefully, when things are better in the commercial world, well be well positioned as it was a bitter and costly experience, said ahmad ramli. currently, military shipbuilding takes up 80% of the groups ship construction business, while the remaining 20% is on the commercial side. bhics chairman tan sri lodin wok kamaruddin said that in the next four to five years, the ratio would be 70:30. but this will depend on the contracts that we have with the armed forces, particularly the navy, he said adding that the companys priority is not to service the military while ensuring that bhic will be able to make revenue with good margins. in all, we are looking forward to a much brighter future in the next several years. we are quite focused in terms of delivering our customers, especially the military. we will remain focused on shipbuilding, ship repair, maintenance of ships which also includes the submarine and also repair and maintenance for aircrafts, added lodin. currently bhic has a combined order book of rm10 billion, including those from its associates and subsidiaries. the bulk of it comes from the rm9 billion contract for six littoral combat ships (lsc) for the royal malaysian navy, which the company has recognised earnings from, while the remaining is from repair, maintenance and overhaul activities. the first lcs is expected to be delivered to the government in 2019. for its financial year ended dec 31, 2014, bhic registered a profit after tax of rm17.9 million from

expects its contracts for the provision of floating storage and offloading (fso) vessels to make up 35% to 40% of group revenue this year, compared with some 20% now, says managing director datuk abdul hak amin. for the fso business, ea technique has a vessel, mt nautika muar, operating in the kayu manis oilfield in bintulu, sarawak, with three years remaining on the charter contract. the groups second fso vessel, mt fois nautika tembikai, is slated for delivery this april to the tembikai oilfield in terengganu under a six-year charter contract. an fso vessel is a tanker-based vessel that functions as a semi-permanent offshore storage facility for oil and gas. fso vessels will become our main revenue earner this year, next year and in the future. one fso vessel can bring in about rm10 million a year in pre-tax profit, abdul hak tells the edge. he holds an 18% stake in the group while sindora bhd, a unit of kulim (m) bhd, is the major shareholder with a 50.6% stake. ea technique reported revenue of rm155.66 million in the financial year ended dec 31, 2014 (fy2014), with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) and net profit of rm59.28 million and rm14.63 million respectively. it was listed on the main board of bursa malaysia in december 2014. while ea techniques second fso vessel will boost revenue in this segment, the group had also last month secured an engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning (epcic) contract for an fso vessel for a full field development project in the north malay basin. based on the groups filing with bursa, the epcic contract will expire in august 2016 and is worth us$191.8 million (rm701.7 million at the time of writing). abdul hak says the contract was awarded by hess exploration & production malaysia bv, a vehicle of hess corp in the north malay basin production sharing contract with petroliam nasional bhd (petronas). hess corp said last month that it will cut its capital and exploratory budget by 16% to us$4.7 billion due to the fall in crude oil prices. however, it will continue to fund the development in the north malay basin. petronas too has said that it will cut its capital expenditure by between 15% and 20% this year. but so far, ea technique has not felt the impact of this. petronas might put some marginal oilfields on hold, but not those that have already taken off. for us, our tembikai fso, [petronas is] going ahead because that is already almost ready. at the moment, we are not affected, says abdul hak. that said, ea technique does not expect to take up anymore fso jobs this year as it does not have the capacity to do so. the group seems to have timed its projects well as contract flow, amid the poor oil price climate, is expected to be slow for this year at least. having fallen more than 50% to below us$50 per barrel since august last year, brent crude oil prices are now trading just above us$60 per barrel. abdul hak expects crude oil prices to hover at us$70 to us$80 per barrel this year. as ea techniques fso contract flow may slow, the group is focusing more on its port operations. it provides vessels, mooring gangs and harbour tugboats, ranging from 30 to 60 tonne bollard pull. our share [of the malaysian market] is about 20% to 25% now. so we are looking at 35% to 40% of the market in three to four years, says abdul hak. he adds that the local market has over 100 tugboats, but many of them are owned by foreign companies. according to its website, ea technique has 15 vessels under its port operations. it is building nine tugboats at the moment, with one to be delivered each month up to the end of the year. we are looking at another 10 to 12 new tugboats for the malaysian market. that is a capital expenditure of more than rm200 million over the next three years, says abdul hak. if ea technique meets this target, its port operations will contribute over 30% to total group revenue. we want to balance our revenue stream, abdul hak says, adding that port operations are less risky and offer the company a 15% margin. for fy2014, port operations contributed 26% to the groups revenue, while 74% came from marine transport and offshore storage operations (including fso vessels, offshore support vessels, liquefied petroleum gas tankers and product tankers, which contribute equal parts to the segment at present). ea techniques revenue in fy2014 rose 28.5% year on year to rm155.66 million, but net profit fell 74% to rm14.63 million. profit had fallen due to a high base in fy2013 where it made a rm37.5 million gain on disposal of an associate company and received a rm2.9 million share of profit from an associate. stripping out these gains, ea techniques net profit fell a marginal 11.5% from rm16.5 million in fy2013. the groups net assets per share stands at 54 sen. this seems to be fairly reflected in its share price, which closed at 54.5 sen last thursday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm272.16 million. the stock has fallen some 16% since it listed at 65 sen in december 2014. rhb research has not rated ea technique but values the stock at 75 sen, indicating a 37%

tunnel for perwaja?", "article": " after many years in the doldrums, could there be light at the end of the tunnel for ailing steelmaker perwaja holdings bhd? sources familiar with the company say the recently announced deal with chinese party zhiyuan investment group co ltd could have its merits. perwaja (fundamental: 0.0, valuation: 0.0) announced last week that it had entered into a memorandum of agreement to explore the possibility of zhiyuans participation in perwaja and/or via other business cooperation model to revive perwaja. despite the positive news, many advise caution, and say that they will only believe that zhiyuan will come in after the deal is inked. anything can happen until then. only when they  perwaja and zhiyuan  both sign on the dotted line will i consider it a done deal, says a market watcher. zhiyuans plan involves utilising perwajas plant in kemaman to make specialised steel products for the china market, the edge has learnt. this, it seems, can be done with minimal cost by the chinese company. perwajas announcement to the stock exchange indicates that zhiyuans core business includes alloy manufacturing, which backs up the specialised steel story. according to industry sources, perwajas plant already has a good asset base that includes two electric arc furnaces, which can be switched off when idle, and thus save costs. blast furnaces, on the other hand, need to be in continuous operation. this could be the right fit for perwaja. there is a lot of demand for specialised steel these days in china, but in malaysia, there is very little demand, the source adds. however, perwaja isnt the only steel miller that is trying to look for a chinese partner. the lion groups megasteel sdn bhd has also been looking for a foreign investor for some time. however, lion group major shareholder tan sri william cheng had been quoted as saying that the structure of the local steel industry posed hurdles to the entry of foreign players. he is of the view that the lack of protection for local millers has made the industry unattractive for foreign investors. it is noteworthy that the chinese party will most likely end up controlling perwaja after it injects funds into the company and helps revive it. currently, the largest shareholder of perwaja is tan sri abu sahid mohamad who has 63.1% direct and indirect interest in the company. kinsteel bhd (fundamental: 0.0, valuation: 1.2), in which abu sahid has a 15.8% stake through his flagship maju holdings sdn bhd, holds a 31.2% stake in perwaja. tan sri pheng yin huah, via his vehicle kinsteel, has an effective 32.4% equity interest in perwaja. pheng acquired a 51% stake in perwaja in 2006 through kinsteel at the peak of the steel cycle, and enjoyed a profitable run, buoyed by high steel prices, up until 2008. sources say back then, abu sahid was deciding between pheng, tan sri william chengs megasteel sdn bhd, and tan sri quek leng chan of the hong leong group. abu sahid chose pheng for various reasons, but principally because he saw that phengs children were involved in the business, which augurs well for succession planning. however, soon after the global financial crisis, perwaja faltered and its plant had to be shuttered after oil company petroliam nasional bhd and utility giant tenaga nasional bhd halted gas and electricity supplies, and perwaja was no longer able to pay its energy bills. as one shareholder puts it, our shares are worth nothing without the chinese partys intervention. all the former glory is lost. perwajas stock closed at 10 sen last friday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm56 million. since november 2013, perwaja has been a practice note 17 company, a category for cash-strapped companies. for its first three months ended september last year, perwaja suffered a net loss of rm44.9 million on rm1.8 million in sales. for the year ended june 2014, net losses amounted to rm1.2 billion. as at end-september last year, perwaja had cash and bank balances of rm7. 5 million, while overdrafts and short-term borrowings totalled rm1.1 billion and long-term debt commitments came to rm276.4 million. the companys finance costs for the three months ended september was a whopping rm18.9 million. according to the sources, part of the restructuring at perwaja involves banks taking a haircut as well. the proposed restructuring scheme entails secured creditors taking a 20% haircut on rm850 million worth of debts, and unsecured creditors taking a 50% haircut. the secured creditors include rhb bank bhd, ocbc bank and kuwait finance house. perwajas unsecured lenders include petronas, which until end-2014, was owed more than rm275 million, while tenaga was owed more than rm175 million in electricity bills. the malaysian government has extended some rm200 million in soft loans, and other unsecured suppliers are owed about rm250 million. the creditors are basically caught between a rock and a hard place, as the only alternative to the proposal is the liquidation of assets, which would not fetch much, considering the specialised nature of the business.  note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects

"weighing bintai kindens cash call", "article": " old-timers would remember bintai kinden corp bhd, whose portfolio included mechanical and electrical engineering works for iconic developments such as the petronas twin towers, the kuala lumpur tower and the kuala lumpur international airport. in its heyday in the early 2000s, its market capitalisation was over rm650 million but today, it stands at only rm33 million, barely 5% of its peak in 2001. the company has been loss-making for the past three fiscal years but some trading interest returned to bintai kinden (fundamental: 0.35; valuation: 1.2) late last year after its 69.82%-owned subsidiary, bintai kindenko pte ltd, won multi-million dollar contracts in singapore. earnings for at least one of these contracts would be booked in the coming months. a sub-contract worth s$24.15 million (rm63.5 million) is slated for completion on june 9. another sub-contract worth s$44.65 million is slated for completion on may 9, 2016. but would this be reason enough for investors to take up bintai kindens proposed share placement and warrant-sweetened rights issue? bintai kinden last wednesday announced plans to place out up to 10% of its share base, a move that will raise rm3 million if the shares are sold at an illustrative price of 30 sen. it also proposed to raise rm3.96 million to rm20.5 million via a warrant-sweetened rights issue to bolster its working capital and pare debt, its feb 4 statement to bursa malaysia read. proceeds for the latter assume that the rights shares are issued at a par value of 20 sen and can vary depending on the final issue price and the take-up for the nine-for-10 rights issuance that come with a free warrant for each rights share. the rights issue, which will only happen if the proposed share placement is successful, is not underwritten but will proceed even if the only taker is its major shareholder bintai holdings (m) sdn bhd, which has promised to take up in full its entitlement of 19.8 million rights shares with 19.8 million free warrants. at a minimum issue price of 20 sen, the rights shares will raise rm3.96 million  a sum that will go to working capital, the company said. the rights issue still needs shareholder approval to proceed but the company has obtained a blanket approval from shareholders at its recent agm to issue up to 10% of its share base for the proposed placement. based on the illustration provided in its feb 4 announcement, bintai kindens gearing of 2.49 times as at march 31, 2014, will remain high at 2.37 times after the proposed private placement. its gearing will only fall to 2.25 times if it receives minimum take-up for its rights issue and reduce to 1.68 times if it sees maximum take-up for its rights issue. bintai kindens interest-bearing borrowings stood at rm144.14 million as at march 31, 2014, but rose to rm247.1 million as at dec 31, 2014, according to the same statement. the stock closed at 32 sen last thursday, about 0.68 times its net asset per share of 47 sen as at sept 30, 2014. if issued at par of 20 sen apiece, the rights shares would be at a substantial discount to its net asset per share but much of bintai kindens asset base consist of receivables, some of which involve long-drawn legal suits, according to notes accompanying its accounts. receivables stood at rm300.46 million, 80.7% of its unaudited total asset of rm372.2 million as at sept 30, 2014, while short-term borrowings stood at rm217.05 million. cash and bank balances were rm35.26 million. the potentially high gearing after the proposed exercises means that bintai kinden is not for the risk averse, even though the stock might see larger trading interest with a larger share base from the rights shares and warrants. investors that can stomach the risk, however, may want to also watch singapores catalist-listed lereno bio-chem ltd (fundamental: 0.00; valuation: 0.00), in which bintai kinden has a minority stake of 3.43%. bintai kindens major shareholder and executive vice chairman, ong puay koon, is also lerenos managing director and ceo. his son, choon lui, sits on lerenos board and is bintai kindens managing director and ceo. together, they owned about 22.72% of bintai kinden as at july 31, 2014 and at least 28.2% of lereno as at oct 25, 2013. it is also worth noting that in april 2011, bintai kinden proposed to sell its entire 69.82% stake in bintai kindenko to lereno for rm150 million worth of new shares in the latter  a deal which was allowed to lapse by september the same year. this could prove to be good news for bintai kindens shareholders, considering bintai kindenkos recent sub-contract wins in singapore and the fact that shares of loss-making lereno are languishing. interestingly, bintai kindens shares went as high as 45 sen on june 17 last year, higher than when the company announced the bagging of the contracts in singapore about two months later. this jump in trading activity was captured in stocks under momentum by theedgemarkets.com and came about when lereno was queried by the singapore stock exchange (sgx). in reply to the sgx query, ong senior on june 9 last year said lerenos board had commenced preliminary discussions with various parties in relation to the potential acquisitions of new businesses pursuant to a restructuring but added that these discussions might or might not result in a deal. lereno was still looking for a new core business at the time of writing. whether or not bintai kindens proposed cash calls are a prelude to more corporate exercises to revive its fortune, its major shareholder can potentially gain a waiver from making a mandatory general offer (mgo) should its shareholding cross the 33% trigger as a result of the proposed exercise. ongs bintai holdings will only cross the 33% mgo trigger if it exercises its warrants after subscribing to its rights entitlement, according to its feb 4 statement. it intends to seek a mgo waiver. at the time of writing, bintai kinden had not released earnings for the quarter ended dec 31, 2014, but the company has said the numbers will not benefit from its recent singapore contract wins. for the six months ended sept 30, 2014, it booked rm11.86 million net losses on the back of a 24.6% year-on-year fall in revenue to rm178.12 million. its core specialised mechanical and electrical engineering services segment contributed over 80% of operating revenue but was also the main source of operational losses of rm7.93 million. its trading segment was also loss-making but the property development, investment holding as well as turnkey, infrastructure and civil and structural businesses were profitable. it remains to be seen whether the major shareholders willingness to pump in more cash will improve the fortunes of the group. but first, it will need to find takers for its planned share placement. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on february 9 - 15, 2015."}, "198":

to remain resilient", "article": " the latest results season (for the quarter ended dec 31, 2014) is expected to give investors some indication of how resilient the earnings of oil and gas companies are. the share prices of some of these companies have rebounded after the heavy selldown last year. a favourable catalyst for the sectors fundamentals, as well as on investor sentiment, is the recent rebound in the brent crude oil price. after bottoming out at us$46.59 per barrel on jan 13, it shot up to us$58.25 as at feb 6, or a gain of 25%. after the nerve-racking plunge of oil and gas stocks, some analysts and fund managers have regained some confidence in the sector. the current share prices, they believe, have factored in all the bad news. the more optimistic among them say another rally could be on the way. experts say that while there are still key concerns about an oversupply of crude oil, companies should remain resilient, particularly those with minimal exposure to fluctuations in the price of the commodity. the crucial question is whether local oil and gas players will be able to maintain their earnings in the face of headwinds. we will definitely start to see the impact (of falling oil prices) in the fourth quarter (ended dec 31, 2014) for some companies. those in production-related activities will be less impacted currently but the ones that are involved in drilling and exploration will definitely be hit, says a senior executive of a major oil and gas services provider. in a recent note, macquarie research projects a significant expansion in the valuations of malaysian oil and gas stocks under its coverage, following a largely disappointing 2014. while there was a downgrade in earnings per share, partly due to the falling oil price, the research outfit says it expects the trend to reverse this year as earnings growth should occur in tandem with a possible crude oil price recovery. maybank ib research has reiterated its buy calls for 9 out of 13 oil and gas stocks under its coverage, projecting a sector earnings multiple average of a reasonable 12.9 times. its 12-month price targets for the stocks imply an upside potential of up to 70% from present prices. credit suisse managing director and co-head of oil and gas research david hewitt believes that there are concrete reasons to remain bullish on the crude oil price trajectory. bear in mind that there are many upstream operators whose earnings are minimally exposed to the oil price volatility. in the previous two downcycles, the crude oil price doubled from its trough within 12 months, so there is a huge upside in the fundamentals. shares of oil services companies have fallen the most as they were highly exposed to crude oil prices, in addition to petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) cutting its capex by between 15% and 20% this year. for example, operators such as perisai petroleum teknologi bhd (jackup rigs), malaysia marine and heavy engineering holdings bhd (offshore construction and marine repairs) and alam maritim resources bhd (offshore support vessels) have seen their shares decline by more than 60% since june. over the past six months, these companies reported much lower earnings, suggesting that the share price decline was partly justified by the worsening fundamentals. on the other hand, companies with stronger balance sheets and large order books have much better prospects. in a recent sector note, credit suisse says it favours quality stocks with attractive valuations and those that are relatively unimpacted by oil price volatility, highlighting sapurakencana petroleum bhd and dialog group bhd in particular. it says that for sapurakencana, only about 10% of its business is directly exposed to the oil price. its price-to-book of 1.51 times is also at a historic trough, suggesting that its stock price has tremendous upside potential. an oil and gas analyst says companies such as dialog and muhibbah engineering (m) bhd present minimal downside risks thanks to their large order books and long-term commitment to petronas rapid project. for the sector, we expect to see some resilience, which translates into an incremental increase in earnings for now. while a pickup in upstream activity would certainly help, we prefer stocks which are more reliant towards long-term contracts and steady revenue expectations, he says. companies who are carrying out risk service contracts (rsc) with petronas, such as uzma bhd and petra energy bhd, look set to maintain their impressive earnings growth. this is because they will continue to recognise profits based on performance. conversely, petronas owns all of the oil extracted and is the one exposed to crude oil price volatility. this is evident from the earnings performance of the two. for the quarter ended sept 30, 2014, both dialog and uzma reported a stronger quarter-on-quarter net profit growth in spite of the bearishness in the sector, which began in june as crude oil dipped below us$100 per barrel. in a feb 5 note, uob kay hian research states that this may already be happening. we have turned neutral (from underweight) on the oil and gas sector following the share price recovery, noting that most oil and gas stocks under our coverage have rebounded by 20% to 40% from recent lows, it says.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia

valuation: 0.6) and perisai (fundamental: 0.35; valuation: 1.2) face a multitude of unfavourable developments in the industry, namely the incoming oversupply of rigs, the softening in demand for e&p works amid low crude prices and petroliam nasional bhds (petronas) move to cut its capital expenditure by 15% to 20% this year. both umwogs and perisais jackup rigs, which are worth hundreds of millions of ringgit and are usually financed via long-term debt, would need to be operational immediately in order to recoup costs. both companies were previously reliant on long-term charters with petronas and now face intense competition for the same tenders. the average dcr in the region stands at about us$140,000 to us$150,000 for a short-term lease that typically lasts 100 days. umwog has two new builds scheduled for delivery this year. naga 7 was to be delivered last month and naga 8 in september. perisais next jackup rigs, pp102 and pp103, will enter the market in mid-2015 and mid-2016, respectively. according to bloomberg, 10 jackup rig contracts are due to expire in malaysian waters by the end of this year. four of the rigs are chartered by petronas and six out of the 10 will expire by the first half of this year (1h15). while umwogs naga 7 will immediately be put to work after securing a six-month works contract, it is crucial for perisai to charter out pp102 by the first half of this year. in a jan 6 note, rhb research points out that perisai faces a significant earnings downgrade should pp102 fail to get a contract this year. its earnings are highly dependent on pp102 obtaining a contract. we have given the company the benefit of the doubt and are imputing 100 days of charter for pp102 this year, but we recognise a downside risk should a charter fail to materialise, says the research house, which has a sell rating on perisais stock, with a fair value of 35 sen. in spite of the bearish factors, the shares of both companies have rebounded strongly over the past month and appreciated despite the continuing decline in brent crude prices. between jan 1 and 28, the shares of perisai and umwog appreciated 6.64% and 15% respectively, while brent crude fell 11.6% during the same period. there are signs that the shares are now trading at attractive valuations, especially if oil prices were to quickly rebound as they did in 2008 (from us$36 per barrel to us$100 in less than 1.5 years). such a recovery would trigger a fresh round of e&p spending and a spike in demand for drilling activity, which would potentially propel oil and gas stocks to their previous highs. during the 2008-09 financial crisis, global oil and gas supply capacity outpaced plummeting demand brought about by the global credit crunch, causing projects to stall and new works contracts to be deferred. the situation is comparatively better now for the upstream segment, with petronas operating more than 100 production-sharing contracts and the development of marginal fields which began in 2011. credit suisse managing director and co-head of global oil and gas david hewitt believes that the outlook for malaysian rig operators is brighter than for their regional counterparts. if the shares are at low valuations, the upside is the potential of mergers and acquisitions as a viable investment strategy. if there is a rebound in prices, the oil majors can quickly reallocate sums and restart previous opportunities. the prevailing themes for the smaller players are leveraging, cash-in-hand, and their ability to survive bad times, he says. hewitt adds that petronas, as an unlisted state-owned oil corporation unlike its chinese counterparts, has its own key drivers and can be the catalyst for growth in the domestic e&p segment. fundamentals for umwog and perisai show a vast difference in their valuation and financial condition. net debt to equity for perisai stands at 129.2%, compared with 28% for umwog, which is still flush with cash following its november 2013 listing. however, this also means that umwogs stock is trading at a large premium to its assets. its book value per share is rm1.40 compared with its closing price of rm2.70 on jan 28. this translates into a price-to-book multiple of 1.97 times. in contrast, perisais book value per share is 91 sen, far above its jan 28 closing of 48.5 sen. while this is due to the earnings uncertainty faced by its upcoming rigs, the stocks undervaluation could also mean a limited downside risk for now  note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers. a score of 3 suggests strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. go to www.theedgemarkets.com for more details on a companys financial dashboard. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on february 2 - 8 , 2015.

contractors was made based on the strength of crec as a subsidiary of china railway group ltd, which is listed on the shanghai and hong kong stock exchanges and is a fortune 500 company, acmar group managing director datuk steven tee told the edge financial daily recently. crec is a well-known asian name, therefore, we believe our drapport residences will be delivered on time and that it would be of the highest quality, said tee. tee said the design of the project is backed by a team of international consultants and designers, and that the design is based on an integrated township living concept. tee said acmar has also secured a construction financing facility of rm476 million from malaysia building society bhd for the project, which will be situated on a 25ha plot of leasehold land

the towers marking their presence at the embassy enclave of ampang. the remainder of the plot will be developed later with another residential high-rise comprising six towers, a commercial/retail mall, and an office complex, he said. the minimum price for a fully-fitted unit is expected to be about rm1.2 million. tee said acmar will only start selling its units after the second quarter of the year. asked about why the project was delayed for almost seven years, tee declined to go into details, only saying that it was problems with the previous main contractor which caused drapport to be stalled. he stressed that the group did not want to see any further delays to the project, which was initially projected to be completed in 2011. on when the project would be relaunched, tee said many expect that the property market will continue to cool this year, but noted that acmar has the capacity to hold on to the units and sell them at a more favourable time. he said drapport is part of the

the winners and losers on bursa", "article": " industry analysts describe it as a price war, ignited by the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec) to frustrate us shale oil producers, and it has had a profound impact on the malaysian stock market. the local benchmark fbm klci was down 10.34% for the year (as at dec 16), reflecting investors deep concerns about the adverse impact of oil prices on federal government revenue, which is closely tied to oil receipts. expectations of a prolonged period of cheap oil will also dent capital spending by petroliam nasional bhd (petronas), which local oil and gas firms are largely reliant on. the present circumstances do not bode well for the listed oil and gas firms which, unsurprisingly, make up six of the 20 worst-performing stocks on bursa malaysias main market this year. notably, offshore vessel operators and drilling rig companies were among those worst hit, with big names such as sapurakencana petroleum bhd, perisai petroleum teknologi bhd and alam maritim resources bhd in the top decliners list (see accompanying table).  as brent crude prices shed 40% year-to-date (as at dec 16), malaysian oil and gas stocks experienced even greater declines, the biggest of which was perisai, which lost 74% of its value. similarly, upstream players such as sapurakencana and alam maritim saw their share prices decline by 57% and 66% over the same period. isolated from crumbling oil prices, however, sportswear manufacturer xidelang holdings ltd turned out to be the worst performing stock on bursa this year, with the stock falling by 80%. the extreme decline came as xidelang reported sharply lower profit in the third quarter ended sept 30, as sales slowed in mainland china due to stiff competition, as well as on lower demand. on the other hand, the 20 top performing stocks on bursas main market for the year are companies that experienced major shareholding changes as well as mergers and acquisitions activity. for instance, damansara realty bhd and lay hong bhd saw takeover offers by their respective major shareholders, seaview holdings sdn bhd and ql resources bhd, at a substantial premium to market prices. interestingly, developer perduren (m) bhd had become the object of takeovers twice in 2014, first by its substantial shareholder tan sri david law in january, and recently by parties led by datuk kamaluddin abdullah. meanwhile, firms such as takaso resources bhd have attracted interest by venturing into the construction industry via the acquisition of a private entity, in this case, dynavance construction sdn bhd. nevertheless, ace market-listed software firm ifca msc bhd is the clear winner for the year, with its stock gaining 670% to date. the it firm, with its gst-related software offerings, was one of the main beneficiaries of the impending implementation of the goods and services tax (gst) on april 1. notably, private investor brahmal vasudevan, who runs private equity firm creador, made major gains from his investments in three technology firms that were among bursas top gainers over the year  ifca msc, smrt holdings bhd and scicom (msc) bhd. among ace market counters, technology firms dominate the top rankings, possibly due to favourable sentiment towards the local software industry as well as gst. aside from ifca msc, other technology firms among the best performing ace market stocks include smrt holdings (software consultancy), mms ventures bhd (industrial automation) and nova msc bhd (e-business solutions). outside malaysia in what was a challenging year for equity markets in developed countries, asian stocks managed to deliver the biggest returns globally, with 19 making up the worlds top 30 gainers. the number one stock, thailands asset bright plc, gained more than 3,000% this year. the company has dual exposure in the real estate and e-commerce businesses in thailand. as with last year, european stocks continued to disappoint, with only four companies making the top 30. likewise, only one company listed in the us made the cut, in spite of the dow jones and s&p 500 hitting all-time highs this year. eight companies from india made the list, largely due to newly elected prime minister narendra modis pro-business approach. modi had proposed a slew of financial reforms as well as new measures to streamline indias bloated bureaucracy with the intention of boosting local businesses. overall, stocks with strong fundamentals were the clear winners this year compared with growth stocks whose earnings have underperformed previously lofty expectations. this is evident in the sheer number of manufacturing firms that make up the top global gainers list, riding on the better economic prospects in the us, the largest

subsidiaries to stop buying foreign assets, it believed petronas would refocus on domestic fields and assets, which favours malaysia oilfields services companies. hence, even with a reduced capex, but a refocus on malaysia, the decrease in the amount of contracts awarded even after considering the fall in oil price, may be less than expected, it said. within macquarie research's malaysia oils coverage, only sapurakencana petroleum bhd is involved in upstream production, after the acquisition of newfield oil and gas fields in malaysia, in addition to other oilfield services, while the other companies are involved in oilfield services. all oil & gas (o&g) stocks have been sold down sharply when petronas stated it would reduce its capex for 2015 by 15%-20% over 2014 in light of the falling

that the maintenance of existing production assets was critical. it said dayang was only involved in hook-up, commissioning and topside maintenance of offshore production platforms, adding that its rm4.2 billion orderbook was until 2018. as petronas delays the development of new fields, the reliance on existing fields to produce becomes more crucial. we believe dayangs contracts are unlikely to

consumer demand, hsbc global asset management said in a statement today. while noting that falling oil prices has a negative inpact on malaysian government's revenue, it said the situation has also opened up opportunities for the government to cut oil-related subsidies.\n\nthe brent crude oil prices has fallen about 50% since june 2014, and national oil company, petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) has cut its capital expenditure by 15%-20% this year.\n\ncredit suisse has recently suggested the malaysian government revise its budget 2015 which was based on an oil price assumption of us$100

particularly in asia, remain attractive in 2015 as corporates continue to record strong profitability and offer good valuations. while both asset classes provide opportunities, equities are likely to deliver higher returns than bonds or cash, it said. in 2015, we will see a divergence in growth expectations for different economies and also in monetary policy globally. the tightening of the us monetary policy, which could lead to the first interest rate hike since the global financial crisis, is a major macro event going forward especially for emerging markets.\n\na well-diversified portfolio is essential to capture opportunities across asset classes as investors enter 2015 where heightened volatility is expected, said hsbc global asset management senior macro and investment strategist hervu00e9 lievore.\n\nhsbc opines that the global economy will continue to recover, with lower oil prices supporting growth and reducing inflationary pressure. however, most countries will continue to grow at rates below their potential in 2015, and the relative weakness in global trade compared to the past two decades, will continue to undermine growth in emerging markets.\n\nnonetheless, it said, historical data suggests that equities tend to deliver positive returns during a recovery phase, and from a cyclical perspective, the outlook is still favourable for equities.\n\nalthough the us interest rates and government bond yields may drift upwards in 2015, they are likely to remain relatively low. liquidity should remain supportive asaggregate funding by major central banks (the us, the uk, europe and japan) is expected to reach as much as us$11 trillion by the end of 2016, it said.\n\nfrom a sector perspective, cyclical stocks, such as technology and financials, continue to look cheap compared to defensive stocks such as consumer staples and healthcare, as these corporates record stronger profitability while still trading at low valuations, hsbc said.\n\nit said the asian powerhouse china's growth is expected to moderate steadily and is likely to be driven by consumption and be less dependent on investment. going forward, reforms in state-owned enterprises, stock connect (access to china a-shares) and the chinese governments monetary easing measures are the three themes governing the performance of the chinese stock market.\n\nhsbc is also positive on corporate bonds, especially in emerging markets in asia,and expects the asset class to provide higher risk-adjusted returns than safe-haven developed market government bonds over the long term on the back of a better valuation outlook. asian corporate credit should remain supported in the near term by ample global liquidity and still reasonable yields.\n\nthe outlook for renminbi bonds remains positive over the medium to long term, despite anticipation of higher volatility in the usd/rmb exchange market. besides offering higher yield carry

of two fpso players", "article": "  the recent sharp fall in oil prices has narrowed considerably the value gap between bumi armada bhd and yinson holdings bhd, the fifth and sixth largest floating production, storage and offloading (fpso) vessel operators respectively in the global oil and gas industry. at the beginning of the year, long before the market entered choppy waters, bumi armadas market capitalisation, at a share price of rm2.50, was rm14.65 billion while yinsons was rm2.26 billion at rm2.19 per share. as at last friday, however, bumi armadas shares had shed 53% and closed at rm1.16, shrinking the companys value to rm6.63 billion. by comparison, yinsons shares had gained 24.3% to rm2.67 and its value had risen to rm2.74 billion. at its latest price, bumi armada is valued at 14.86 times its estimated earnings for fy2014 ending dec 31 while for yinson, it is 23.24 times its estimated earnings for fy2015 ending jan 31. analysts attribute bumi armadas descent to its relatively high and mature earnings base and credit yinsons resilience to its still intact growth potential. because it started from a low base, yinson is expected to see stronger cash flow and earnings over the next two financial years as it reaps the full benefits of existing contracts and new ones that have been secured but have yet to commence. speculation that yinson is soon to ink another huge fpso contract in west africa has also bolstered its share price. this is aside from recent news that its 30%-owned unit yinson energy sdn bhd has received three licences from petroliam nasional bhd (petronas), which could open up fresh opportunities. nevertheless, as bumi armadas shares tumble, investors have begun to view it as oversold. after all, the group did have a strong order book of about rm21.7 billion as at june. some also believe the hiring of a new ceo to succeed the long-serving hassan assad basma, who suddenly announced his resignation effective jan 1, 2015, could attract investors and lift the stock. perhaps a bigger boost could be a potential mergers and acquisitions (m&a) deal involving bumi armada. the edge financial daily last friday quoted sources as saying that tycoon t ananda krishnan is looking to divest his 34.9% stake in the company and that some local oil and gas service companies had been approached for a possible deal. a source tells the edge that if the tycoon cannot find a buyer at a satisfying price, and if bumi armadas shares continue to weaken, he would most likely take the group private again, as he did in 2003 when the market was tough. another option for a k is to restructure or merge it with another oil and gas company, the source adds. indeed, ananda has a penchant for taking his companies private and relisting them later as bigger entities with higher valuations. after delisting bumi armada in 2003, he did it to mobile operator maxis communications in 2007 (relisted its local business in 2009) and pay-tv operator astro all asia networks in 2010 (relisted in 2012). after about a decade at the helm of bumi armada, hassans resignation during a delicate period for the oil and gas industry has left the company with big shoes to fill. although hassan will continue to be engaged as a consultant by bumi armada until mid-2016, it will be interesting to see who takes up the challenge as the groups new ceo in the current low oil price environment. bumi armada started to go downhill in may after it reported a 40% drop in net profit to rm64.8 million in its first quarter ended march 31, 2014. revenue fell slightly to rm468.9 million from rm488.8 million previously. the company attributed the reduced earnings to lower utilisation of its offshore support vessels  a segment with an oversupply of assets  as well as slower activity in its transport and installation segment due to winter conditions. the disappointing results were also due to a change in the companys accounting treatment  changing operating lease to finance lease  that is said to be a more prudent and conservative method. this change was sudden, causing speculation that the group might be facing problems at its african operation. however, in a previous interview with the edge, hassan explained that the change in accounting treatment was to enable the company to take on larger-scale fpso projects, which had different requirements. bumi armada has been expanding its fleet in africa and currently has 11 vessels in nigeria, 6 in angola and 5 in congo. meantime, following the plunge in its share price, analysts have seen value emerging in bumi armada. according to bloomberg, the stock has 14 buy, 4 hold and 2 sell calls.  operationally, we like bumi armadas fpso business model in the light of the current weak or volatile oil market environment. its contracts are firm with favourable termination clauses and minimal speculative building. valuation-wise, bumi armada is inexpensive. we are not ruling out a potential privatisation of the stock for it is trading at sub-1 times book value, says maybank investment bank research in a recent report. it has a target price of rm2.05 on the stock. at rm1.16, bumi armada is valued at a 26% discount to its net asset value per share of rm1.57 as at nov 30. meanwhile, yinson has been climbing the ladder steadily. in terms of fleet size, it is just two vessels behind bumi armada, which has five fpsos and two under construction while it has four fpsos and one under construction. yinsons acquisition of norwegian fpso player fred olsen production asa (fop) for us$165.6 million late last year has served as a game-changer for the company. the acquisition was funded by borrowings and a share placement that brought in high-profile strategic investors  tan sri mokhzani mahathir and his partner and veteran oil and gas player k c yeow. the fop buy and the entry of mokhzani and yeow helped yinson garner strong investor interest. it spiked to an all-time high of rm3.47 on sept 15 before surrendering some gains to close at rm2.67 last friday. yinson has an order book of us$3.7 billion (rm12.86 billion), which is expected to last it until 2023. the group, having leveraged fops strong presence in west africa, is the leading contender for the offshore cape three points fpso project off the coast of ghana. in fy2014 ended jan 31, the groups net profit doubled to rm69.8 million from the year before while revenue nearly breached the rm1 billion mark at rm941.9 million. its total assets grew to rm2.1 billion from rm800.9 million previously. according to bloomberg, consensus has forecast a net profit of rm119 million in fy2015 (its 6mfy2015 net profit as at july 31 had already hit rm61 million) and rm137 million in fy2016, indicating strong growth ahead. according to theedgemarkets.com, bumi armada has a valuation score of 0.6 while yinson has 1.5. the score provides a composite measure of historical returns and valuation on a scale of 0 to 3, with 3 suggesting that a company gives higher than average market returns and is trading at a lower than average valuation.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on december 22 -

operators to save them from losses due to price fluctuations, an opposition lawmaker said. pkr secretary-general rafizi ramli said that rather than having to buy fuel wholesale, it would be more equitable for the stations if a consignment system was adopted, as seen in countries such as australia and south africa. then station operators will not have to pay up front to giant oil companies for fuel. currently as agents, they are only paid a commission by the oil companies based on the volume of sales. under the current wholesale system, oil companies such as petronas, shell, petron and bhp require that petrol stations buy stock in cash that is at least three days worth of their sales at any given time. this exposes the station operators to losses when oil prices go down, as they buy their stocks of petrol and diesel at a higher price. [in] the consignment system, the financial risks faced by operators are removed. the petrol prices can also be revised frequently without any financial impact on key stakeholders, rafizi said in a statement. rafizi warned that petrol station operators are at risk of closing down under the automatic price mechanism putrajaya uses to fix the retail price of petrol and diesel, saying that at current pump prices retailers would have racked up losses of up to rm15,000. they will have to bear these losses for the rest of the month, and run the risk of debt snowballing, owing to the higher price they paid to petrol companies. rafizi said by implementing the consignment system, the excuse that fuel prices cannot be revised on a weekly basis no longer exists. putrajaya resisted calls for weekly revisions of petrol and fuel pump prices despite the continued plunge in global oil prices (which have reached below us$50 (rm178.50) a barrel this week, and is expected to be at us$40 a barrel by the end of the month). it removed fuel subsidies early this month due to the tumbling of global oil prices and set up a managed float pricing system where prices would be set on a monthly average price. the price would be announced at the end of each month for the following month. rafizi said that with weekly revisions, ron95 petrol might reach rm1.40 a litre by the end of january, as opposed to rm1.91 a litre that consumers are forking out this month. weekly price reviews of petrol and diesel prices will see it fluctuate according to market prices, and barisan nasional can no longer collect billions of ringgit in hidden taxes as what is happening now, he said. rafizi previously alleged that putrajaya made rm633 million in one month from the difference between world oil prices and the prices malaysians pay for petrol and diesel. he said if the federal government refused to revise the system, it meant it wanted to maintain above-market prices to collect taxes from the commodity.

the nation: can malaysia meet gdp growth target with oil at us$60?", "article": "  economic growth requires positive thinking, datuk seri ahmad husni hanadzlah reportedly said last monday (dec 8)  incidentally the same day investors sold local-currency debt papers amid mounting concerns on the impact of sliding crude oil prices on malaysias fiscal and current account balance, causing local bond yields to spike. on the same day, former prime minister tun mahathir mohamad wrote on his blog that we should think very carefully before we comment on the oil price. to quote him: is it true that [the fall in oil prices from us$110 to us$70] will have no effect on us (malaysia) or that it will be good for us? mahathirs question is one playing in the minds of many, especially with malaysia being singled out as asias only casualty of lower oil pri-ces. while the country is reducing its dependence on oil-related revenue, easily a quarter of its income is tied to the natural resource and it is investments by petronas and other oil majors that have spurred growth in oil and gas-related stocks that, in turn, has helped power significant gains on the local stock exchange in recent years. his question on whether growth is indeed unaffected by lower oil prices rings even louder now that oil prices have tumbled 45% from their respective highs in late-june, with brent crude ending at us$63.33 last friday and western texas intermediate (wti) at us$59.39 per barrel. similarly, the bloomberg asia pacific tapis crude has fallen 45% over the same six month period to close at us$65.55 last friday  20.1% below petronas official selling price of us$82.09 a barrel just a fortnight ago on nov 30 and 37.6% below the us$105 that malaysia is believed to have based its budget2015 projections on. the ringgit, which closely tracks the decline in oil prices, skidded 1.04% in one day to a new 51/2-year low of rm3.5073 versus the us dollar around midday last monday before closing at rm3.4955 on dec 8  sparking speculation of intervention by bank negara, traders say. the ringgit ended at the same level versus the greenback last friday, 4.4% weaker in just a fortnight. yields on 10-year malaysian government securities (mgs) maturing july 2024 added 34 basis points to 4.19% last friday from 3.85% on nov 28 before the landmark decision by the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec) to maintain output, data on bank negaras website showed. ten-year islamic sovereign malaysian government investment issue (gii) maturing may 2024, meanwhile, climbed to 4.38% last friday, up 27 basis points from 4.11% on nov 28  their highest in about 10 months. concerns are mounting whether tremors so far from plunging oil prices will turn into a quake and evolve into something more systemic, says chua hak bin, head of emerging asia economics bank of america merrill lynch (baml). judging from the official comments so far, the government hasnt fully woken up to the economic and financial impact of the collapsing oil prices, he tells the edge. petronas warnings were sounded when oil was at us$75. oil is now below us$65, he says, referring to a recent warning of a 15% to 20% cut in capital expenditure next year that could significantly impact gdp. the prevailing view now is that crude oil prices will stay at between us$60 and us$70 per barrel, possibly for a considerable period, as technological advancements makes it even cheaper to feasibly develop shale oil and gas fields, from north america to the uk as well as china. nomura internationals senior political analyst alastair newton, for one, recently told clients theres something of a fatigue on geopolitical shocks to oil supply that is now being outweighed by over-supply fears. oil bears are predicting us$40-levels, a level prices saw in 2008 in the wake of the global financial crisis. at the time of writing, bloomberg data showed 71% or 17 of the 24 research houses predicting malaysias 2015 gdp will come in below 5.5%  the mid-point of the governments official forecast of 5% to 6% growth next year. it is worth noting that even the most bullish of predictors  citigroup and deutsche bank  are only expecting 5.6% gdp growth for 2015. the mid-point was 5.2% with five forecasters saying malaysia will grow slower than its official forecast at 4.2% to 4.9%(see table). bamls chua is forecasting 5% gdp growth for 2015, but says the risk is clearly tilted toward the downside. we are looking at a small miss on the 3% fiscal deficit target currently (at 3.8% of gdp), but it is not inconceivable that the fiscal deficit should blow up to 5% of gdp or more if petronas profits and government-related revenue plunges by more than half, he says, pointing out that bank loan exposure to oil and gas investments, on the back of the boom in the last few years could be material. many oil and gas share prices have plunged by more than 50%. i would be surprised if non-performing loans to the sector does not pick up, he says, adding that the tough market conditions will make it difficult for companies looking to tap the equity markets for funds next year. even without higher cost of debt, corporate debt levels have risen from 80% in early 2008 to over 90% of gdp currently. similarly, the era of cheap and abundant easy credit caused household debt to mountain to rm854.3 billion or 86.8% of gdp in 2013 from rm243.2 billion or 67.2% of gdp in 2002. malaysias public debt servicing costs now run at about rm2 billion a month, a result of expansionary measures taken, especially since 2008, to grow malaysias economy. 2q2014 gdp hit as high as 6.4% before slowing to 5.6% in 3q2014. thanks to the strong growth in the first nine months, malaysias gdp will only need to grow between 3.8% and 5.8% in 4q2014 for the country to meet its growth forecast of 5.5% to 6% growth for this year. still, in the past seven years alone, government debt has climbed from 40% of gdp to just a shade below its self-imposed 55% ceiling. it is projected to reach rm569 billion or 53.8% of gdp in 2014 but the level is nearer to 70% of gdp if contingent liabilities were to be included, experts say. apart from complicating the decision for bank negara to raise interest rates, malaysias high leverage on all fronts  household, corporate and government  also likely limits the ability of private consumption (c), domestic investments (i) including that from corporations as well as government spending (g) to power economic growth. these are two out of four key components of gdp growth by expenditure [c+i+g+(x-m)], with the remaining component being net exports (x-m) or the excess of demand for the goods and services produced by a country. while a cheaper ringgit might help spur exports growth, chances are that the impact of lower absolute selling prices for oil as well as other soft commodities like crude palm oil (cpo) would hit first. and given that real estate was the largest contributor to the strength in the i components contribution to gdp since 2008, the projected headwinds seen in the local real estate sector  from an oversupply situation and falling prices to tighter bank mortgage terms  would also reduce the components strength as an engine of growth going forward. malaysias 3% fiscal deficit target for 2015 also puts a cap on government spending, more so given the chances of lower revenue from lower oil prices. while malaysias inland revenue board (irb) is reportedly targeting to collect rm142 billion in taxes next year  up from rm129 billion in 2013 and its target of rm140 billion this year  collection may fall short if salaries and profits of businesses decline, observers say. another dampener on the c or consumption component is the impact of the goods and services tax (gst) on consumer sentiment and spending from april next year. malaysias budget deficit could be 4.4% of gdp should oil prices average us$60 to us$69 a barrel, all else being equal, says maybank investment banks chief economist suhaimi ilias in a recent note. bamls chua, for one, reckons that when the new reality of indefinitely lower oil prices sinks in, malaysia would find its currently self-imposed soft budget constraints being hardened: lower oil will likely usher in a new age of fiscal austerity and, hopefully, discipline, he says. the recent sharp deterioration in the trade balance is also compounding the risks. if novembers trade surplus does not improve, fears of a current account deficit  the first for a long while  will re-surfaceu2026 if wti stays below us$60 and brent below us$65 for the next 12 months, malaysia will likely see a double miss  neither the 3% fiscal nor gdp growth targets will be met in 2015, chua adds. already, renewed fears of foreigners unwinding their high positions in mgs on the possibility of a sovereign rating cut should malaysia fall into the so-called twin deficit situation  current account deficit as well as fiscal deficit  next year have sent the fbm klci 4.8% lower the past fortnight to close at 1,732.99 points last friday. in short, the fear of malaysia not meeting its fiscal targets is compounded by fears of falling oil prices dragging cpo and liquefied natural gas prices lower, which combined could cause exports to fall sharply and push the current account and balance of payments into a deficit next year. widespread fears of a sovereign rating downgrade on a twin deficit situation happening will cause foreigners to trim holdings in financial assets more aggressively, resulting in sharper-than-expected depreciation of the ringgit, observers say. foreigners have between july and october this year withdrawn about rm7.3 billion or more than us$2.2 billion worth of investments in malaysias sovereign debt, as seen by the fall in foreign holdings of mgs to 45.91% in october from 48.35% in july. foreign holdings of mgs still stood at rm147 billion in october, bank negara data show. this is just over one-third of bank negaras reserves of rm411.7 billion as at end-november, already down by rm8 billion (us$2.4 billion) over one month from rm419.7 billion as at end-october. foreign selling of ringgit-denominated bonds and subsequent conversion into us dollars would put further pressure on the ringgit, which is already deemed as a casualty of lower oil prices. declines in ringgit vs usd and crude oil prices so far suggests that every us$10 drop in crude oil price can result in a 6 sen depreciation in ringgit vs usd u2026 this is based on the simple observation that as brent crude tumbled us$47 from this years high back in june 19, the ringgit lost 29 sen against the greenback, maybanks suhaimi wrote in a dec 9 note. maybanks forex research team forecasts the ringgit to continue on a weak bias against the usd at 3.50 in 1q2015, 3.53 in 2q2015 and 3.55 in 3q2015 before stabilising to 3.45 in 4q2015. just how much further the central bank has had to smoothen the impact of the selling will be revealed when bank negara releases its accounts as atdec 15 this monday(dec 22). whatever the case, maybanks suhaimi reckons that the tougher conditions from lower oil prices means malaysia needs to reprioritise its development spending allocation as well as review and optimise its operating expenses to meet its targets. in short, malaysia needs to exercise zero tolerance on avoidable overspending that has been repeatedly highlighted in the auditor generals report. if the tough conditions forces out wastages, malaysia could emerge stronger ahead. lim chee sing, rhb research institutes executive chairman and chief economist, for one, prefers to see falling oil prices as a double-edged sword. it acts like an indirect tax cut for people in the large oil importing countries and may just provide a boost that is very much needed for a stalled-speed recovery in the major world economies. for portfolio investors, adversity breeds opportunity, provided you take an investment view and are able to identify and pick quality stocks, says lim, who reckons oil prices will likely stay low for at least another one or two quarters, if not longer. with change being the only constant in a dynamic world, malaysia needs to ensure it makes the best out of the current situation. admitting that lower oil prices would pose a challenge for malaysia is the first step in the right direction.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on december 15 - 21, 2014."}, "231": {"date_posted": "23/12/2014", "title": "trade wise: mui in limelight for asset sale plan, khoos divorce", "article": " while the billion-ringgit divorce case of business tycoon tan sri khoo kay peng continues to make the headlines in the malaysian and uk tabloids, investors are fascinated by the news that his asset-rich flagship malayan united industries bhd (mui) is looking at the disposal of assets to unlock value. trading in muis shares was suspended for almost four working days (from nov 20 to 25) before the group announced to bursa malaysia that it is engaged in serious discussions with a potential party to explore the possibilities of disposing of certain substantial assets to realise their value. mui didnt elaborate which assets would be involved or how substantial they would be. however, considering the groups usually jittery response to speculation of asset disposal and the almost four-day suspension of its shares, investors see the announcement as significant. mui was up 17.4% from 23 sen on nov 23 to 27 sen last friday, giving the company a market capitalisation of rm747.8 million.  the flagship of khoo, mui owns assets with a potential market value that is said to be far greater than its enterprise value (ev) of rm1.34 billion (its market capitalisation plus net borrowings of rm588.3 million as at sept 30, 2014), according to market observers who follow the stock. of the assets, the jewel of the crown appears to be corus hotel hyde park at lancaster gate, london, which reportedly could fetch a market value of u00a3200 million (rm1.06 billion). the 390-room hotel that mui had acquired in 2001 sits on 21,635 sq ft of freehold land and is carried at a net book value (nbv) of only rm257.5 million in the companys balance sheet. at u00a3200 million, corus hotel hyde park would be valued at u00a3513,000 per room. by comparison, the 447-room intercontinental park lane, situated on the other side of hyde park, was transacted last year at u00a3301.5 million or a price per room of about u00a3675,000. back home, mui owns the refurbished corus hotel in jalan ampang, kuala lumpur, which sits on a 78,458 sq ft plot opposite the petronas twin towers. this property is carried at an nbv of only rm60.5 million or rm771 psf. mui also has two plots of freehold land (with buildings on them now) in jalan ampang. one measures 38,104 sq ft and is carried at rm8.1 million (rm213 psf) while the other is 32,895 sq ft and carried at rm24.6 million or rm750 psf. the first plot was acquired in 1991 and the second in 2007. james wong, managing director of registered property valuer vpc alliance (kl) sdn bhd, tells the edge that corus hotel kuala lumpur can fetch indicative values of rm212 million or rm2,700 psf and the two plots rm1,800 psf each, which translates into a total market value of rm127.8 million. apart from its notable property assets, mui owns stakes in two major retailers as well  98.22% of local player metrojaya bhd and 35.17% of london-listed laura ashley holdings plc. while it is difficult to ascertain the value of metrojaya as it is no longer listed, muis stake in laura ashley is worth u00a370.84 million (rm375.8 million). mui also holds equity interest in mui properties bhd (74.32% valued at rm206.5 million), pan malaysia corp bhd (66.51%, rm108.4 million) and pan malaysia holdings bhd (69.19%, rm77.1 million). all are listed on bursa malaysia. despite its rich assets, mui reported a net loss of rm3.08 million or 0.1 sen a share in the nine months ended sept 30, 2014, on revenue of rm441.19 million. the reasons for the dismal results include its high cost of borrowings (rm36.33 million) and relatively low yields from its core businesses in the hotel and retail industries. according to the companys 2013 annual report, corus hotel hyde park reported a pre-tax profit of u00a33.5 million (rm18.54 million) in fy2013 while corus hotel kuala lumpur delivered rm15 million. considering what these two assets can fetch on the market through disposal or redevelopment  more so in the case of the jalan ampang property  the returns that mui has been deriving from them are deemed low. london property prices have gone up quite a lot. if i could get rid of these assets at a good price, i would u2026 as for the retail business, it is still generating stable income and id keep it, says a businessman, adding that mui needs to realise the value of its assets or make them work harder and, at the same time, trim its debt. indeed, there was news in the uk in july that mui had appointed a real estate agent to scout around for a buyer for corus hotel hyde park. however, this was denied by mui when reported by the edge financial daily on sept 29, quoting the uk article. whatever muis plan may be, its growth potential has attracted savvy investor datuk dr yu kuan chon. as per the edge financial dailys sept 29 report, the companys 2013 annual report  published on june 4, 2014  listed yu as one of its top 30 shareholders with 44.63 million shares or a 1.53% stake as at april 28, 2014. yus name did not appear anywhere in muis 2012 annual report, which means he must have purchased the shares between the second half of 2013 and early this year. the chairman of ynh property bhd, yu is regarded as a shrewd businessman. he managed to block an attempt by tycoon tan sri quek leng chan to privatise hong leong capital bhd (hlcap) last year as he believed the companys value was higher than what quek had offered. since april, however, it is not known whether yu has purchased more shares in mui or sold any. coming back to muis announcement to bursa on nov 25, the group says it will make a full disclosure of the transaction once discussions are completed and an agreement has been entered into. it, however, has reminded its shareholders that there is no certainty on the outcome of the discussions. what i suspect is that the buyer and seller (mui) thought they could come to an agreement last tuesday. but come tuesday, they had not come to a conclusion while the stock had to resume trading, says an observer. however, if one looks at it positively  that mui is thinking of disposing of its substantial assets to realise their value  it puts the group on a path to enhancing shareholder value. meanwhile, last fridays news that the kuala lumpur high court had ruled that it had the jurisdiction to hear khoos billion-ringgit divorce dispute against his estranged wife, former beauty queen pauline chai, will continue to put the tycoon under the spotlight. chai has sought for the divorce case to be heard in the uk, where the sums paid out can be extraordinary. according to british media, she is expected to demand half of khoos estimated rm2.3 billion (u00a3440 million) fortune. considering the amount, its hard not to think that the divorce case will have an indirect impact on mui, in which khoo owns 47.67%. according to a report by the malaysian insider, judge yeoh wee siam said chais domicile was in malaysia and so the malaysian court could hear and determine the couples divorce case. the common law principle that the wifes domicile is dependent on her husband continues to apply in malaysia, she said in allowing khoos application.

recovery to push greenback higher", "article": " the strong us dollar environment which is expected to continue into 2015 will mean a tough time for equity markets in asia, especially for markets with high exposure to commodities. if demand for commodities continues to slow next year, southeast asian markets are likely to suffer. according to johanna chua, managing director and head of asia-pacific economic and market analysis at citi research, us economic growth is at the opposing side of other regions such as the eurozone, asia-pacific and japan. after years of maintaining near-zero-interest rates, the federal reserve is expected to raise interest rates next year as the us economy recovers. this situation is likely to drive up the dollar against other currencies, depressing commodity prices further, says chua. a strong dollar is not very good for commodity prices, unless we get a lot more action from chinas stimulus, which will drive up demand for commodities. if you look at the outlook on china, i dont think the government is going to do a mega stimulus. so it is going to be a strong dollar environment, which is tougher for asia to perform, chua says during a recent interview with selected malaysian media. she expects the ringgit to settle at rm3.40 per dollar next year. the ringgit has depreciated 9.4% against the dollar to last wednesdays rm3.4425, from the years peak of rm3.1463 on aug 27. according to bloomberg data, the ringgit is expected to settle at rm3.36 per dollar by the end of 2015. within asia, markets with high yield currencies, such as the indian rupee and indonesian rupiah, will do relatively better than the rest, she says. this is because investors could borrow from a low interest rates countries, such as those in the eurozone or japan, and invest in a market with higher yields. while the ringgit can be deemed as a high yield currency compared with the euro and yen, citi research does not have an overweight call on the malaysian stock market due to the economys exposure to commodity prices such as crude oil, natural gas, palm oil and rubber. nevertheless, malaysias diversified economy, with almost one-third of its exports made up of electrical and electronics components, is expected to be less impacted by the low commodity prices, compared with some latin american and african countries, says chua. the good news about malaysia is that you are not as commodity-centric as some latin american countries. malaysias economy is pretty diversified. yes, it has commodities, but also a lot of manufactured goods. so the fact that the economy is diversified, unlike south africas or brazils, helps. but there will still be an impact from the low commodity prices on the economy and stock market, she says.  the benchmark ftse bursa malaysia klci has been under selling pressure since july, dropping by 6.8% to last fridays 1,749.37 points. the index dropped by over 4.2% between nov 26 and last wednesday, a period of five trading days. selling pressure was exacerbated by petronas ceo tan sri shamsul azhar abbas comments that the national oil company may undertake a 15% to 20% cut on its planned capital expenditure next year, due to low crude oil prices. north asia to do well, indonesia to shine within asia, chua says citi research is more bullish on the china story, on the back of its continued economic reform and rebalancing strategy. the firm is also bullish on taiwan, as its export-dependent economy rides the us economic recovery. the low crude oil price is favourable to the economies of north asia, which are huge consumers of the commodity. on the other hand, southeast asia will be impacted, as most [of its countries] are commodity exporters, and their prices move in tandem with crude oil. we are overweight on china; we think they are going to do more cyclical easing and a few more reforms going into next year. the valuations in southeast asia are not really cheap, and a lot of the growth is slowing down. so where do we see more [of a] growth story? maybe china, maybe places with more quantitative easing, and we are also a little bit more positive on taiwan, as a play on the us upcycle. it is more on north asia than southeast asia, says chua. however, chua expects southeast asian bond markets to still do well, due to the high yields they offer investors, as well as fuel price reforms in countries with big fuel subsidy bills, such as indonesia and malaysia, she notes.  we expect there is a demand for carry-on yield, and in southeast asia, yields are still pretty high in indonesia. our strategists have become a little more positive on the indonesian story on the bond side, on the back of the fuel price reform there.  low crude oil prices will not impact government revenue the decision by the organisation of petroleum exporting countries (opec) on nov 27 not to cut production suggests that crude oil prices will continue to remain low over the next 12 months. petronas shamsul forecasts crude oil prices to settle around us$70 (rm241.28) to us$75 per barrel next year, compared with the malaysian governments forecast of us$105 per barrel, as outlined in budget 2015. some parties have been calling for the malaysian government to revise its budget 2015, due to the substantially lower crude oil prices. income from the petroleum industry amount to about 40% of the federal governments coffers. however, chua is not so concerned about the impact of low crude oil prices on malaysias government revenue. she says the impact of crude oil prices are more profound on malaysias subsidy bill, rather than government revenue. we find petroleum-related revenues for malaysia dont seem to be responsive to low oil prices. i think the government is always very conservative when they do the budget, so they set a lower tapis oil price, and there is always some room for manoeuvre with petronas dividends. [government] revenue seems less sensitive to oil prices, but the subsidy bill seems to be more responsive. the deregulattion of ron 95 is very positive for long-term sustainability of fiscal and credit ratings, she says.  nevertheless, chua says that low crude oil prices will impact natural gas prices. malaysia, being one of the largest natural gas exporters in the world, will be impacted by the low prices of natural gas if crude oil prices continue to fall.  a wild card that could support crude oil prices is if china cuts its interest rates further next year. investors are waiting for the peoples bank of china to cut interest rates to support the countrys slowing economy. the real interest rate is getting higher and higher, and people are starting to worry that china is behind the curve. but when they finally cut the rates [on nov 25], you see commodity prices went up, all the currencies rallied, so there was a little bit of a positive signal, chua says. \nthis article first

19 to the current level of around us$80 and the lacklustre global economic conditions are weighing on petrochemical products. nevertheless, some analysts are calling a buy on petronas chemicals group bhd (petchem). its share price has fallen 11.6% over the last one year to rm6.11 last wednesday. among the 23 analysts who cover petchem, five are calling for a buy, 11 a hold and seven a sell. the average target price is rm6.61 per share. petrochemicals are cyclical products, and their prices depend on supply and demand factors, besides crude oil prices. petchems management is guiding for the prices of petrochemicals to increase going forward, says an analyst with a local independent research house. at the current valuation of between 12 and 13 times estimated fy2015 earnings per share, petchem is an attractive stock to buy into. it also has some of the best profit margins in the industry, the analyst adds. according to bloomberg, petchem has an average price-earnings ratio of 16 times. according to platts data released on oct 16, asian petrochemical prices have dropped sharply amid tumbling crude oil values due to concerns about global growth and demand, with aromatics such as paraxylene dropping to a four-year low. paraxylene, an aromatic hydrocarbon derivative used for making plastic bottles and polystyrene products, contributed 13% to petchems annual revenue for fy2014 ending dec 31, as estimated by jp morgan in a recent report. paraxylene is included in olefins and derivatives products, which contributed about 70% to petchems rm7.2 billion revenue for the six months ended june 30, 2014 (1hfy2014).  the spot price for paraxylene in southeast asia dropped to us$1,107.50 per metric ton in october, some 22.6% lower than the level in december last year, while methanol traded at us$405 per metric ton, compared with us$602.50 per metric ton. asian paraxylene prices have been falling since late september due to the emergence of new start-ups in the region, according to platts. besides that, weak feedstock naphtha prices will also drive down paraxylene prices, added the global provider of energy, petrochemicals, metals and agriculture information. producers are ramping up supply of paraxylene to take advantage of the low feedstock price, despite the still-sluggish demand for the product, says an industry source. weak demand for polystyrene, a downstream product of paraxylene, also suppressed prices. naphtha, a type of hydrocarbon primarily used as a feedstock to produce petrochemicals such as gasoline, bitumen and other olefins, was trading at us$81.09 per metric ton in october in singapore, compared with us$106.84 last december. however, chinas imports of paraxylene jumped to 1.006 million metric tons in september, the highest since data was made publicly available in late 2007. between january and september this year, chinas imports of paraxylene increased 5.2% year on year to 7.1 million metric tons. methanol is estimated to contribute 16% to petchems revenue in fy2014 ending dec 31, according to jp morgans estimate. fertilisers, consisting of urea and ammonia, and methanol will contribute about 30% to petchems annual revenue. based on bloomberg data, petchem has higher earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) margins compared with its peers. for fy2013, the company registered ebitda margin of 33% compared with ptt global chemical pcls 9.93% for its fy2013 ended december and sumitomo chemical co ltds 9.65% for its fy2014 ended march. it is believed petchems advantage over its peers is partly attributable to its parent, national oil company petroliam nasional bhd. while concurring that petchems valuation is attractive at the moment, an analyst with ta research says it is still not the time for investors to buy the stock. investors should gauge its performance because of the execution issues at the company, she says. based on its track record, petchem has not been able to execute well operationally. this can be seen in a number of plant shutdowns, some of which are not statutory at all in nature, as well as the gas supply issue. since it was listed in late 2010, petchems plant utilisation rate peaked at 83% in fy2012, before dropping to 78% last year due to the start of major statutory plant turnarounds in the third quarter. statutory plant turnarounds are periodic maintenance that is a required industry practice. the utilisation rate at its olefins and derivatives plants fell to about 65% in 2qfy2014. however, utilisation at it fertilizers and methanol plants increased to 85% in 2qfy2014 from 67% in the previous quarter as the group had resolved its gas supply issue. petchem has plants in gebeng, kertih, labuan, bintulu, gurun and pasir gudang. last thursday, petchem reported declines of 9.7% and 27.2% in revenue and net profit to rm10.7 billion and rm1.96 billion respectively for the nine months ended sept 30, due to lower volumes and prices.  according to kenanga research and rhb research institute, petchem will do better in 2hfy2014 as the group has almost finalised its statutory plant turnaround, which started in the third quarter of last year. kenanga researchs teh kian yong said in his research report dated aug 12 that petchems earnings is expected to recover from the second half, due to the end of the statutory plant turnarounds as well as improving product prices. nevertheless, the cyclical nature of the petrochemicals industry causes petchems share price to trade accordingly. there is also a lack of short-term catalyst for petchem, says the ta research analyst. the first capacity expansion through the sabah ammonia and urea (samur) plant will only be completed in 2016, as will the joint venture with basf for the aromatic plant in gebeng. while petronas has kick-started job awards for the refinery and petrochemical integrated development (rapid) project in pengerang, johor, most of the contracts are for civil construction, earthwork and engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (epcc). it is expected that petchem will announce its own investment in the rapid project. however, the impact on the groups revenue and ebitda will only materialise once the plant is fully operational, that is by 2019, according to analysts. the uncertainty over the direction of crude oil price has caused many investors to stay on the sidelines. some remisiers say they would only consider petchem if it falls below rm6.  nevertheless, it seems the market has started to appreciate petchem, as its share price has started to move up from its lowest one-year close of rm5.93 on oct 21.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on november 10 - 16, 2014,

plunging prices of oil also pushed the ringgit to 3.43 per us dollar yesterday, with reuters reporting that it would be the largest two-day depreciation since july 1998. meanwhile, the benchmark february contract on the bursa malaysia derivatives bhd fell as much as 4.1% to rm2,083 per tonne, its lowest since sept 22, said reuters. analysts said the double downside whammy in local o&g stocks came from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries latest decision not to restrict oil output and petronas proposed move to cut next years capital expenditure by 15% to 20%. bank of america merril lynchs asean economist chua hak bin said the collapse in oil prices would impact the bottom-lines of petronas and other o&g firms. it is estimated that every dollar change in oil price has a rm1 billion impact on petronas pre-tax profit. it would also hurt investment activities, he said in a note yesterday. in deeming the cut in petronas capex in 2015 as worse than expected, affin investment bank research analyst isaac chow said other o&g companies may follow suit. this will translate into lower earnings and weaker investor appetite for the domestic o&g stocks, he said in his report yesterday. however, the earnings impact may not be reflected immediately, but will likely be skewed towards late 2015, alliancedbs research analyst tan arhnue told the edge financial daily. nevertheless, analysts are of the view that o&g firms with strong order books are likely to prevail over falling crude oil prices. chow prefers companies with integrated business models that have a good geographical spread, on top of a strong order book log. avoid single business stocks that may see earnings downgrade, he advised. public investment bank research in a note yesterday warned that o&g firms could face long-term sustainability issues if they are solely reliant on petronas awards. cimb investment bank research analyst norziana mohd inon said one of her preferred stocks is sapurakencana due to its good leverage in the international and regional markets. she maintained her add rating on the stock with an unchanged target price of rm6.84. comparatively, she maintained her overweight call on the o&g sector. aviation stocks, however, gained on the prospect of cheap jet fuel on falling oil prices. analysts said the lower crude oil prices are a boon for airline companies, with expectation of higher earnings. alliancedbs aviation analyst tan kee hoong pointed out that airlines will benefit from savings on fuel cost, which will translate into lower fuel surcharges for consumers. on ceteris paribus, airasia bhd and airasia x bhd would save an additional rm18 million and rm12 million respectively in fy15 and fy16 for every us$1 cut in jet fuel price, tan added. midf research analyst chua boon kian concurred, saying the current scenario bodes well for airlines as fuel expense makes up 45% to 50% of the two airlines operational expenditure. it will save them substantial operational expenses to report higher earnings, he said. chua expects airasia and airasia x to announce higher earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 (1q14) and 1q15. shares in airasia closed up 8.14% or 21 sen to rm2.79 yesterday, emerging as the top three biggest gainers, while airasia xs share price fell 1.48% or one sen to 66.5 sen.  this article first appeared in the edge

hand, which has an outperform call on the stock with a target price of rm1.23, notes that the sector has undergone some de-rating with low crude oil prices and sluggishness in the global economy. however, we believe pantech is well positioned in the downstream segment, which will continue to shine in the medium-term as petronas goes all out to ensure the success of the rapid project, says kenanga. while its prospects at pic seem bright, tan adds that pantech will not be overly dependent on rapid. he says that in the five years till the commencement of the rapid contracts, there would be new opportunities and projects for pantech to take part in. its not like we are just harping on pic or rapid, says tan. without disclosing details, tan adds that the group is also able to provide its high-temperature products to power plants. in fact, pantech has been supplying valves to malakoff corp bhd. note that malakoff is a 51%-owned subsidiary of mmc corp bhd, which was awarded the epcc for pics co-generation power plant through a tie up between its unit, mmc engineering services sdn bhd, and siemens malaysia. pantechs trading division saw higher earnings during the period due to stronger sales demand and better contributions from its overseas subsidiary. its manufacturing division saw lower earnings due to a decrease in output and export sales demand. tan says its trading division will see increased activity in the quarters to come, hinging on the development of rapid. right now, everything is running on rapid. i would say that rapid could be reflected in the second half of the current financial year (2hfy2015). on its manufacturing side, tan says that the group is limited by capacity. different factories have different capacities. i would say that we are the biggest in malaysia in terms of capacity, he adds, pointing out that pantech has a 40% market share in the country. pantech saw its shares priced at an all time high of rm1.11 on july 17 this year after jumping 30.29% from a one-year low of 85 sen on march 28. its shares closed 13.26% lower at 97 sen last friday, with a market capitalisation of rm579.5 million. on the recent oil and gas industry slump, tan is of the view that investors should take a long-term perspective. if you take a short-term view of oil and gas, you either make money very fast or lose money very fast, he says.

downturn in the market but also sees opportunities in the softer market condition. the company, which is 55% controlled by umw holdings bhd, encountered choppy waters prior to its flotation exercise on bursa malaysia on nov 1 last year. in a nutshell, the shifting of its business focus  from pipe manufacturing to exploration and drilling via jack-up rigs  has bode well for umw o&g. for the first six months of the financial year ended june 30, 2014, it posted a net profit of close to rm114 million and revenue of rm434.3 million. despite reporting better financial results at end-august, the company has been badly hit by negative market sentiment. the stock has shed almost 21% to rm3.20, from rm4.05 on aug 22. however, umw o&g ceo rohaizad darus tells the edge that he is unperturbed by the selldown and is prepared for such downturns. i look at the downturn [in the industry] positively. we are fundamentally strong as a company, with good contracts and marketable new rigs, so i believe we should be able to weather the storm, he says. he adds that the group is prepared for such uncertainties, with its development hinging on three strategies  having more clients globally, thus not relying on any one single client, expanding into more countries so as not to be dependent on a single market, and establishing good relationships with clients and leveraging on these relationships to secure future jobs. with these strategies, we are not only addressing the growth of the company but also managing the exposure to risks in the event of a slowdown, he explains. rohaizad says there are still various opportunities available in the o&g market for the company to capitalise on. during the storm, the industry will consolidate as there are companies that may not be able to sustain their operations. this opens the door to possible acquisitions. he notes that it will be a buyers market when the industry is consolidating. if the opportunity presents itself at the right price, why not? umw o&g may consider companies that are also in the drilling business  not necessarily limited to jack-up rigs businesses  and those with semi-submersible ships, drillships or tender rigs, says rohaizad. we are close to becoming a regional player and we are actively looking at the middle east, north sea and australasia [as part of our plan] to become a global player in 10 years. rohaizad says it is essential for umw o&g to continue adding more rigs to its fleet even with the sluggish market as building rigs during a peak cycle would be more costly. we are only two weeks into this uncertainty in the o&g market, so we have not seen the effects yet. but if this continues, then i believe we can get rigs at a cheaper price from the yard. at end-june this year, umw o&g had deposits, cash and bank balances of almost rm1.1 billion. on the other side of the balance sheet, its short-term borrowings amounted to almost rm1.1 billion while long-term debt commitments were rm425.2 million. umw o&g, rohaizad says, is maintaining its long-term plan of getting a minimum of one rig per year and expanding its business. we are not going to slow down our international development or stop adding more rigs to our fleet due to the uncertainty in the market. he remarks that the perception that rigs tend to be chartered out at lower rates during a slow period is flawed. it also depends on the type of rigs, he says, adding that demand and rates for jack-up rigs are stable, while rates for semi-submersible ships and ultra-deepwater rigs are declining. while many expect the market to soften, rohaizad says umw o&g will see sustainable future demand due to the small-scale field projects in malaysia and regionally. currently, there are 105 small-scale fields in malaysia, which are divided into 24 clusters. out of the 24, only six have been awarded through risk-sharing contracts. the six are the berantai field, balai-bentara cluster, kapal-banang-meranti cluster, tembikai-chenang cluster, tanjong baram field and ophir field. there are 18 more small-scale fields available. we dont know when petronas will develop the fields, but as long as malaysia still relies on oil for its economy, it has to develop these fields, says rohaizad. umw o&g had an order book of rm2.1 billion as at aug 31. this comprises two long-term contracts lasting until 2018 for two rigs (naga 1 and naga 4), while the remaining rigs (naga 2, naga 3, naga 5 and naga 6) will see their short-term contracts expiring next year. the companys bid book is at us$1.8 billion (rm5.9 billion) for

malaysian-controlled nam cheong ltd, a leading global shipbuilder of offshore support vessels (osvs), is considering listing on bursa malaysia and the oslo stock exchange to enhance its brand and investor value while expanding its global reach. the home-grown miri-based marine offshore company, set up in 1968 by billionaire and former fishmonger, datuk tiong su kuok, was listed on the stock exchange of singapore in may 2011 via a reverse takeover of a listed company there. nam cheong owns and operates what it claims is one of the largest shipbuilding yards for osvs in malaysia. these include platform supply vessels, safety standby vessels, anchor handling tug supply vessels, accommodation work boats and barges. we are always exploring avenues to enhance shareholder value via increased profits, share trading liquidity, brand, reputation and investor perception. we would like to be the first malaysian singapore-listed company to have dual listings in kuala lumpur and oslo, nam cheong ceo leong seng keat tells the edge. in malaysia, we are ready [for listing]. weunderstand the listing requirements and how to comply with the rules. in oslo, many big marine businesses are listed on the exchange  we have the global standing to join them. nam cheong prides itself on having grabbed about 15% of the global osv market this year by delivering 30 of the worlds total osv production, estimated at 150 to 200 vessels. next year, it will deliver 35 osvs. nam cheong claims to have a 7% market share of osvs in this region and is the second largest player east of the suez canal. it also claims to have a strong reputation in southeast asia, the middle east, west africa and the us for its expertise and track record in constructing osvs primarily for shipowners and marine service operators. apart from orders from malaysian firms, nam cheong has clinched orders from mexico, brazil, the middle east, india and west africa. it recently added indonesia to the list. some of its longstanding customers are major oil and gas players such as bumi armada bhd, petra perdana bhd, topaz, borcos shipping, vroon, petrovietnam, sapurakencana petroleum and tidewater. the company has benefited from the governments local-content policy and petroliam nasional bhds rm300 billion, five-year capital expenditure programme for 2011-2015. this programme has provided jobs for osv operators, many of which are nam cheong clients. unsurprisingly, nam cheong derives about 50% of its revenue from malaysia. prior to 2005, all of its revenue came from the local market. currently, its osv market share in malaysia is still high, at around 75%, according to its estimates. though leong says nam cheong is not under pressure from the malaysian authorities to list on bursa, its recent fast growth may compel it to expedite this process. indeed, its osv orders shot up after the implementation of petronas programme. nam cheong sold 13 osvs in 2012 and 20 in 2013. this year, sales are expected to surge by 50% to 30 osvs and are projected to hit a company-high of 35 next year. nam cheong has delivered over 100 vessels to local and international clients since 2007. however, the company has not set itself a time frame for listing. we are not in a rush. the listing is not meant to raise funds from the capital market, but is more for branding and improving liquidity and investor perception. we have done all that is needed [to raise funding for expansion] in singapore. leong says investors can expect a better set of financials this year and next, due to the sharp rise in the companys osv orders and deliveries. in the first half of 2014, revenue rose 54% to rm786 million and profit after tax (pat) jumped 75% to rm134 million. for the full financial year of 2014, revenue is expected to hit rm1.827 billion and pat a company-high of rm266 million. according to a consensus of eight research houses compiled by bloomberg, revenue will rise to rm2.181 billion and pat to rm308 million in fy2015.  leong says the company hopes to achieve an annual growth of 20% to 30% over the next five years. this is based on international forecasts that expect regional and global demand for shallow water osvs to remain high despite the current softening in crude oil prices. despite rapid growth, nam cheong has a healthy balance sheet with a gearing ratio of 0.6%. leong says the company is in a comfortable position to benefit from robust growth in the osv segment due to quality, reliability and track record in the delivery of vessels and the confidence in the company of its repeat customers. he attributes the success of nam cheong to the foresight and boldness of its 72-year-old founder and chairman, tiong, who actively leads the group while engaging in other businesses. tiong, who is fuchow and hails from sibu in sarawak, started nam cheong with a capital of about rm40 in 1968 to build boats in miri. the market capitalisation of nam cheong now stands at more than rm2 billion. datuk tiong was key in propelling the company forward. in 2006, he decided to move our manufacturing model to build-to-stock (bts) from build-to-order. this enables delivery to take place within six months rather than 18 to 24 months, says leong, who is a son-in-law of the chairman. with bts, nam cheong builds ahead of estimated demand. leong says the company has a track record of selling all of its bts vessels planned for any one year, even during the past financial crises. we have gone through many down cycles and demonstrated our ability to read market demand. since 2007, we have had an impeccable track record of selling all pre-built vessels prior to delivery, says leong. due mainly to its bts model and its outsourcing of shipbuilding to china at lower

portfolio is to find companies listed on bursa malaysia that operate with sustainable business models, improving productivity, offer unique products or services, have innovative ideas or disruptive technologies, trading on low stock valuations, with good growth prospects and have strong balance sheets. obviously it is a challenging task but i believe there are still a number of companies with many, even if not all, of the above characteristics. and i believe these companies that meet many of the above criteria will do well in the longer term, even as the overall stock market valuations consolidate. as stated last week, i believe the overall stock market is overvalued, especially when viewed against a backdrop of rising internal and external economic challenges, and a more worrisome political, racial and religious outlook. even at the micro levels, the outlook for productivity and private investments is not positive. this week, i bought two other bursa listed companies that meet my criteria. on oct 13, i bought 6,000 shares of crescendo corporation bhd at rm2.84 per share, following this stock being picked by insider asia in www.theedgemarkets.com and the edge financial daily (fd) in the morning. crescendo is a johor developer with a landbank of 2,921 acres, of which 54.8% is within the iskandar malaysia (im) region. more critically, 65.7% of its gross development value is industrial properties. this remains a high growth area into the future, catering to both the needs of singapore smes and the growing economic activities of im itself. singaporeans bought 56% of the nusa cemerlang industrial park development by crescendo. its other developments are mostly the bread and butter type of mixed landed residential and commercial. unbilled sales stand at rm128 million with rm800 million worth of launches for the next two years, for a company with a market capitalisation of rm637 million. the stock is trading at a trailing 12-month p/e ratio of only 4.3 times and a yield of 5.8%. net gearing is 9.2%. price to book is 0.8 times. based on edge research revaluation, it is trading at about 60% discount to asset value, as most of its landbank was acquired between 1996 and 2006. two of its largest tracts of land are in bandar cemerlang (1,390 acres) and kota tinggi (794.4 acres), carried at rm3.08 psf and rm1.12 psf respectively. given its low p/e valuations, low gearing, high dividend yield, large discounts to asset value and good growth prospects while operating in a sector of minimum risks, edge research (see www.theedgemarkets.com) assigns crescendo a fundamental score of 2.3 out of 3.0 and a valuation score of 3.0 out of 3.0. it has a rising roe of above 20% for a company with very small net debt. beat that. on oct 14, i added 10,000 shares of willowglen msc bhd at 73 sen each to my portfolio. again, this was done after the stock was highlighted at insider asia in www.theedgemarkets.com and fd. this is a technology company, highly scalable with a proven track record. it provides systems and solutions for supervisory control and data acquisition (scada), a computerised system for gathering and analysing real time data. its clients include the housing development board of singapore, singapore power, public utilities board of singapore, prasarana malaysia and petronas gas. 82.6% of its revenue is from singapore, with the rest from malaysia. the company is expanding not just in the two countries but also in indonesia. its revenue and pre-tax profit have grown consistently the past three years, increasing at 23% and 27% annually respectively. the company carries inventory of less than rm1.5 million, which is less than 1.5% of sales consistently. roe has improved from 15% to a whopping 25%. willowglen is cash rich with rm53.6 million, representing 30.3% of its current stock price. at its current market capitalisation of rm174.03 million, its dividend yield is 4.1% and its trailing 12-month p/e is 8.8 times. edge research gives willowglen a fundamental score of 3.0 out of 3.0 and a valuation score of 2.4 out of 3.0. willowglen is a technology company with a proven track record that has excellent prospects to grow regionally. given its cost structure, roe will continue to rise faster than sales growth. a company growing at over 20% annually, cash rich, roe of 25% and trading at 8.8 times net p/e? i think this is value investing. a summary of my portfolio is attached with the stocks i bought, when i bought and at what price. given the overall depressing stock market over the last week, this portfolio of three stocks, only bought a few days ago, is performing reasonably well.   this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on october 20 - 26, 2014."}, "262": {"date_posted":

listing exercise will increase the groups cash and cash equivalents to rm23.32 million from rm15.37 million currently, and thus reducing carimins tendency to seek external funding. as for the proceeds of rm66.8 million raised from its initial public offering, carimin plans to utilise 52.9% or rm35.32 million to purchase an offshore support vessel; 18% or rm12 million will be used to develop its

total borrowings of rm41.9 million, translating into a gearing ratio of 0.39 times. mokhtar said the repayment of bank borrowings from part of the listing proceeds will optimise its financial position and reduce its interest cost by between rm240,000 and rm400,000 annually, based on effective interest rate of between 3% and 5% respectively.  this article first appeared in the edge financial daily,

selldown in them. only a year ago, the sector was much sought after by fund managers and the stocks were a screaming buy on bursa malaysia. so, what has gone wrong in the industry? falling crude oil prices are seen as the cause of the selling pressure, but analysts opine this is only an excuse for investors to take profit in o&g stocks, most of which had surged to multi-year highs, if not new peaks. the continued drop in crude oil has surely dampened sentiments. but there is unlikely to be any major hit on the local o&g companies earnings as most of them have already secured contracts that could last them two years, says an insurance fund manager. he believes disappointing earnings are the main cause of the selling, partly because some of the major contracts awarded by petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) have not been reactivated. earnings delivery wasnt there u2026 so far the figures are either in line with or below expectations. none has announced a pleasant surprise, says the fund manager, noting that there would be bargain-hunting opportunities should share prices slide further. corporate earnings will pick up next year. however, visibility will get blur beyond the two-year horizon when the existing contracts end, he adds. analysts believe the upstream players in the o&g industry have more to worry about than the downstream players. the upstream segment is expected to see a slowdown in contract flows while the downstream segment will continue to be driven by jobs in the refinery and petrochemical integrated development (rapid) project. kenanga researchs teh kian yeong, who has a neutral rating on the sector, says the upstream segment has been sluggish, adding that foreign awards fuelled the bulk of the rm5.6 billion worth of contracts in the third quarter this year. some of the anticipated upstream contracts, such as fabrication, offshore support vessels and inspection, repair and maintenance (irm), may only emerge at the very end of 2014 and run the risk of spilling over into 2015. nevertheless, teh says it is not all gloom and doom for the o&g industry. he is of the view that the downstream segment will continue to shine, thanks to the rollout of jobs. only about rm27 billion worth of contracts out of an estimated rm51 billion have been dished out thus far. more is expected from the downstream segment in the medium term, he says, adding that some of the awards have already been priced into the stock prices. industry analysts advise investors to stay away from stocks that have not locked in long-term contracts. rhb researchs kong ho meng has downgraded four stocks so far  perisai petroleum teknologi bhd, muhibbah engineering (m) bhd, daya materials bhd and malaysia marine and heavy engineering holdings bhd. he says the common themes of these four downgrades were a slow order book replenishment rate, underutilised assets and operational uncertainties, resulting in low margins. kong has also turned cautious on the o&g sector as he believes the current valuations are unsustainable. we believe that as players expand abroad, the big gap in valuations (compared to their regional and global peers) should narrow and malaysian o&g stocks should shed their premiums. currently, malaysian o&g stocks are valued higher than their regional and global peers, albeit on a lower earnings base and market share, says kong. amid investors cautious approach, analysts expect the focus to primarily be on subcontractors and suppliers, such as knm group bhd and pantech group holdings bhd. other counters that are favoured include wah seong corp bhd, dialog group bhd, dayang enterprise holdings bhd and alam maritim resources bhd. among the o&g stocks that have beenfalling since august are yinson holdings bhd (-22.3% to rm2.70), coastal contracts bhd (-21.2% to rm4.20), bumi armada bhd (-20% to rm1.64), umw oil & gas corp bhd (-19.2% to rm3.30) and sapurakencana petroleum bhd (-16.5% to rm3.68). besides falling crude oil prices and less-than-impressive earnings, some analysts and fund managers are also concerned about petronas cutting its capital expenditure (capex). they observe that the negative sentiment began when petronas president and ceo tan sri shamsul azhar abbas guided that the national oil company could reduce its 2015 capex. he also cautioned upstream o&g players against going on a buying spree, as there are insufficient contracts to go around. this statement was a cautionary message to the industry, especially upstream players. a fund manager tells the edge that there are uncertainties on the horizon, because of speculation about a possible change of the guard at the national oil company. should that happen, it would mean changes to petronas capex policy and so on. will the new chieftain spend as much or less? will he want to continue efforts on reviving mature fields, meaning eor (enhanced oil recovery)? asks the fund manager. this year, petronas has spent the bulk of its capex on its floating liquefied natural gas facility and the implementation of chemical enhanced oil recovery (ceor) projects. crude oil prices slid below the us$90 per barrel level last week amidst concerns about oversupply as demand is expected to grow at a slower pace. the persistent decline surprised many as the geopolitical tension in the middle east and russia was expected to drive the prices up. the benchmark brent crude fell to us$89.05 per barrel last friday, a level not seen since november 2010, while west texas intermediate (wti) dropped to us$84.62 per barrel. crude oil prices have tumbled by almost a third from their peak of us$115 per barrel in june, at which point they had remained above us$100 for a year. analysts attribute this to muted demand and ample supply. in recent weeks, the market has remained focused on the supply and demand fundamentals, which look overwhelmingly bearish, vandana hari, editorial director at platts mcgraw hill financial asia, tells the edge. these factors, especially on the demand side, are not going to change anytime soon. in my view, there is a lot of uncertainty in the oil market, especially when it comes to geopolitical problems. she reckons that crude will only rise above us$100 per barrel after its recent fall if there is a major disruption in supply. the organization of the petroleum exporting countries (opec) has been pumping more than 30 million barrels per day, which is a collective target agreed to by each of its members. but now that crude has dropped below the benchmark of us$90 per barrel, many expect opec to intervene to stabilise prices. according to the organisations oil market report for september, world demand this year is expected to reach 1.05 million barrels per day (mbpd) and supply 1.68 mbpd. for 2015, opec forecasts a demand of 1.19 mbpd and higher supply of 1.24 mbpd. moving forward, credit suisse believes brent crude will remain in a new range of us$97 per barrel in 2015 while wti will average us$89 per barrel. it predicts that prices will grind down to us$86 and us$80 per barrel respectively in 2016 and 2017.  by madiha fuad and fatin rasyiqah mustaza this article first appeared in

subsidiary of petroliam nasional bhd (petronas), will have much to gain if the national oil company abandons its strategy to directly own its fleet of liquefied natural gas (lng) vessels. in a report yesterday, cimb research is of the view that petronas may sell four lng new builds it ordered in 2013 as it relegates ship ownership to low priority. gan jian bo, an analyst with cimb research, said petronas may be changing its ship ownership strategy to directly order lng vessels, revealed in august 2013, because its hands are full with lng projects in malaysia and overseas which offer a lot better internal rate of return (irr). petronas is very busy with several projects. they have the refinery and petrochemical integrated development (rapid) project in malaysia, the gladstone lng project in australia and one in canada with progress energy, gan told the edge financial daily. gan estimates that lng projects would typically offer irr of 12% to 15%, compared with the high single-digit returns from the shipping business. if petronas does sell these vessels to misc, petronas will likely charter these ships from misc to meet its shipping requirements in bintulu and other ongoing projects like flng1, said cimb research. the inclusion of four new long-term lng charter contracts with petronas will help mitigate miscs lng earnings decline, since six of its lng ship charters expire in 2014 to 2017, it said. this is timely as petronas four new vessels are slated for delivery in 2016 and 2017 and will be earnings accretive from 2017. the new ships also come with the option to procure four additional lng vessels, which could be passed on to misc. with that view, cimb research made an add call on miscs stock at rm6.90 and gave it a target price of rm8.22. midf research said petronas change of strategy is logical as it does not have the expertise to manage lng vessels. petronas ordered the four lng new builds after its attempt to privatise misc failed to ensure that there will be no interruption in the lng transportation services, an analyst from midf research told the edge financial daily. petronas does not have the expertise to manage these assets and had to engage misc to manage the construction of the new ships. selling the ships to misc would make sense, he said. he added that the shipping expert would also have the financial muscle to acquire the four vessels from petronas, having strengthened its balance sheet after the sale of its 50% stake in gumusut-kasap semi floating production system (l) ltd to petronas carigali sdn bhd in 2013. to recap, petronas had in august last year announced that it had decided to buy its own lng vessels, after it failed to privatise misc. two months later, the group awarded the contract to build four lng vessels, with the option to order an additional four lng vessels, to south koreas hyundai heavy industries co. at the same time, misc was engaged to provide project management and technical consultancy services for the construction of the new lng ships.  this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on november 6, 2014."}, "267": {"date_posted": "5/11/2014", "title": "back to

piece of land it is acquiring in jalan ampang, kuala lumpur, after two of its applications to the local council were rejected. oxley rising had initially planned to build two 83-storey skyscrapers comprising offices, serviced suites, hotel and retail space on the parcel just 500m from the petronas twin towers. the freehold land currently houses six bungalows, including nasi kandar pelita and chef choi restaurant. the proposal for the twin high-rises, submitted to the dewan bandaraya kuala lumpur (dbkl) in may 2014, was rejected in july. yts architecture sdn bhd, on behalf of its client oxley rising, then handed a fresh application to dbkl for approval. on aug 5, the new proposal revealed that the height of the buildings had been reduced to 53 and 64 storeys. the plan also offered 765 units of serviced suites, 308 units of hotel rooms and 450 units of offices. the buildings would sit on a 9-storey retail podium cum multi-storey car park. this proposal was rejected on sept 4, 2014. both oxley malaysia and oxley singapore declined to comment when asked about the details on this project and the plot ratio it is hoping to obtain. dbkls kl city plan 2020 guide states that the allowable plot ratio for this particular parcel, which oxley is in the process of acquiring, is eight. however, based on the high plot ratio obtained by magna prima bhd for a project which is less than 1km away, oxley is probably hopeful of obtaining a plot ratio of at least 12. magna prima is redeveloping the former site of lai meng primary school. oxley announced in november last year that its subsidiary, oxley rising, had entered into a deal to buy a 135,356 sq ft land parcel in jalan ampang for rm446.67 million, or a record price of rm3,300 psf, from the executors of the estate of leong mai leng. based on oxleys announcement to the singapore stock exchange (sgx), the purchase price was arrived at on a willing buyer-willing seller basis after taking into account current market prices of the surrounding area and its assessment of the lands development potential. it added that no formal valuation of the land had been conducted. a total of rm44.67 million was paid as deposit, and the balance is to be paid on the completion of the acquisition, which is scheduled to take place on or before nov 4, 2014. oxley did not reply to the edges query if the deal will be completed as planned. a land search conducted at the kuala lumpur federal territory department of lands and mines reveals that as at sept 19, the parcel had yet to be transferred to oxley rising. it had registered a caveat on the parcel on nov 21, 2013. the search documents show that this particular lot measures 13,860.03 sq m. however, the announcement to sgx states that the area of the land being purchased is 12,575 sq m. it is not known why there is a difference in size. one possibility is that the size of the lot to be divested is smaller than its original size. oxley has been expanding rapidly in malaysia through land acquisition and joint ventures, though its ventures do not appear to be smooth sailing. it has aborted two ventures so far. in july this year, oxley announced that its unit, oxley malaysia pte ltd, had terminated its proposed acquisition of tck capital sdn bhd for rm77.85 million. oxley malaysia wanted to take over tck capital mainly because the ministry of finance had agreed to sell a leasehold parcel in jalan hang tuah, kuala lumpur, to tck capital in nov 2011. the plot, measuring 4.73 acres, was supposed to have been sold for rm190 million. the ministry subsequently decided to cancel the sale, resulting in oxley malaysia aborting the purchase. in january this year, oxleys subsidiary, oxley treasure sdn bhd, entered into a memorandum of understanding (mou) with sepang goldcoast sdn bhd and its subsidiary, sepang bay sdn bhd. sepang goldcoast and sepang bay hold interests in two parcels of leasehold land measuring 116.88 acres in sepang, selangor. under the mou, oxley treasure would be engaged to develop a mixed development in phases and get 85% of the gross development value (gdv) of the land. the mou was mutually terminated on june 24, 2014. even so, oxley appears to have plans for projects with at least rm10 billion in gdv in malaysia. in an aug 22 presentation, oxley said its total land parcels in malaysia amounted to a total of 239,274 sq m, including some parcels that are being developed on a joint-venture basis. one of oxleys projects is the development of a parcel in section 16, petaling jaya, located next to phileo damansara.

billion capital expenditure plan, which largely aided exploration and production activities. now, however, it seems that the tide may turn, and downstream oil and gas players are likely to benefit from petronas rm86 billion pengerang integrated complex (pic) project, comprising the refinery and petrochemical integrated development (rapid) complex. likely beneficiaries of pic include knm group bhd, pantech group holdings bhd, wah seong corp bhd and muhibbah engineering (m) bhd. they will mainly be required to manufacture and supply equipment, and possibly fabricate structures in pic. most of these counters share prices have more than doubled in the past year, buoyed by the possibilities in pengerang. knms share price has gained some 175%, hitting a one-year high of rm1.10 on aug 4, from a low of 40 sen in october last year. the stock closed at 81.5 sen last friday, which translates into a market capitalisation of rm1.33 billion. pantechs shares hit an all-time high of rm1.11 on july 18, gaining 30.29% from 85.8 sen at end-march this year. the company ended trading at rm1.06 last friday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm633.2 million. muhibbahs and wah seongs share prices have more than doubled over the past year, closing at rm2.86 and rm1.68 last friday, with market capitalisations pegged at rm1.22 billion and rm1.3 billion respectively. an analyst from kenanga research says, its the process equipment guys and manufacturers that will have more play in pic. she notes that the main engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (epcc) contracts have already been awarded. [so] right now, its for them [the winners of the epcc contracts] to give out the jobs to the local guys as sub-contractors. out of the 13 contracts that petronas has awarded for pic, five are epcc contracts for the refinery and steam cracker component. they were awarded in august to five international outfits from taiwan, china, spain, the uk and japan, which in turn have joint-venture agreements with local players. most local players are in the final stage of negotiation to undertake portions of the multi-billion ringgit epcc packages as sub-contractors, and will likely conclude the talks either at the end of this year or early 2015, says an industry executive. meanwhile, pantech executive director adrian tan says the group is working closely with the epcc contractors to meet their need for pipes, valves and fittings (pvfs). he adds that once pic is completed, pantech will look forward to supplying maintenance services to the complex. health and safety are key u2026 oil and gas companies requirements are very strict and the constant monitoring of the pvf for corrosion is mandatory, he says. tan opines that petronas has been looking to create more value in the downstream segment. after the completion of pic, i believe the business in the downstream segment will continue to flourish. aaron tan of midf research says local fabricators alone do not have the capacity to construct pic. in fact, a local fabricator recently noted that even if all the yards in malaysia were 100% dedicated to pic, there would still be insufficient capacity. work has to be done overseas and there will be a spillover effect, he says. located on a 6,242-acre site in johor, pic comprises the rapid complex and its associated facilities, including the pengerang co-generation plant, a regasification terminal and an air separation unit. the multi-billion-ringgit project also includes a raw water supply project, crude and product tanks as well as central and shared utilities and facilities. however, before taking into account capacity, focus should first be on the individual companys capability, financial strength and human expertise, says midfs tan. meanwhile, the industry executive explains that foreign companies are the likely candidates for epcc contracts because local players usually do not have the strong balance sheets needed to execute epcc services. but it is not cost effective for these foreigners to bring in workers from overseas. it would be more cost efficient for them to hire local companies for execution instead, the industry executive says, adding that a fairly large amount of pic jobs would involve civil construction. the industry executive notes that even though the major contracts that are worth more have been awarded to foreigners, local downstream players will find that a less than rm1 billion contract is sufficient to allow them to move forward and generate profits. even though there appears to be a slowdown in the upstream segment, midfs tan does not think that the increase in pic jobs will outstrip the demand for offshore fabrication services. at this point in time, we are not really bullish about offshore fabrication projects. there will still be jobs available, such as the kasawari central processing platform that is worth us$1 billion (rm3.26 billion), but the potential winners are just a minute few. the analyst from kenanga has a negative view on the oil and gas offshore fabrication segment, but is bullish on pengerang. on the pengerang side, it will be vibrant, she says. with offshore fabrication jobs hard to come by since late last year, she believes that there will still be jobs coming in but they will be in the fabrication space. other beneficiaries of pic, apart from onshore fabricators, are construction companies such as wct holdings bhd, zelan bhd and gadang holdings bhd. wct had in july won a rm341.88 million contract for the construction of roads in rapid while gadang won a rm350 million package for the provision of preparation works for phase 2 of rapid. meanwhile, zelan secured a rm248.5 million contract to construct a jetty on the site. this article first appeared in the

sept 30, 2014, down from rm23.12 million a year ago, mainly due to thinner profit margins from the cement segment arising from intense price competition. it said the lower sales volume from the

corresponding quarter.  revenue came in at rm1.12 billion, up 9.8% from rm1.02 billion a year ago, primarily due to higher utilities revenue, as a result of higher off-take by customer and the upward revision of electricity tariff effective jan 1, 2014. the group also announced a second interim single tier dividend of 20 sen per share, in respect of the financial year ending dec 31, 2014.  year-to-date profit however, dropped 24.5% to rm1.27 billion, compared to its previous corresponding period, due to the recognition of deferred tax assets (dta) arising from the investment tax allowance that it was granted for the lng re-gasification segment. excluding the impact of the dta, profit for the period increased by rm220.9 million or 21%. petgas closed down 14 sen or 0.64% at

30, 2014(3qfy14), from rm226.21 million. revenue for the period under review slipped a marginal 2.2% year-on-year to rm8.23 billion, from rm8.41 billion, mainly due to a decrease in sales volume by 4%, despite an increase in average selling price by 2%. the group said that its operating profit for 3qfy14 was at rm230.7 million, down 26.8% on year from rm315.3 million, mainly as a result of lower gross margin by rm100.9 million, which is primarily a result of higher product cost due to unfavourable timing differences of the prices on the mean of platts singapore, which is a measure of fuel oil pricing in singapore, compared to the previous corresponding quarter. yfg bhds audited financial statements for the financial year ended june 30, 2014 (fy14) will be revised, due to the adjustment on

at large may look like they have gone pear-shaped now, but ijm land bhd is forging ahead with its biggest township in the southern region  the rm5 billion 1,200-acre sebana cove resort in pengerang. the group acquired the development  including its resort facilities  lock, stock and barrel from the arab malaysia group for rm120 million, or rm2 psf, in 2009. it has turned out to be a bargain as development land in johor has appreciated manifold since then, especially those in and near johor baru, where certain developers have paid close to rm1,000 psf. a few months after we bought it, someone wanted to buy it from us for rm180 million, recalls ijm land group managing director and ceo datuk soam heng choon. it was a good deal, but thats because it was after the global financial crisis of 2008 and arab malaysia, like so many people, wanted to degear. it was also exiting the property business, so it made sense for it to dispose of the land. sebana cove resort used to be popular with locals and singaporeans who came for a round of golf or had seafood at nearby sungai rengit. while it does have some upscale facilities  a 60.5-acre marina, a ted parslow 18-hole championship golf course, a five-star hotel with 24 two-bedroom apartments for longer stays, a clubhouse and townhouses  soam admits that the project lacks the spark to draw the crowds. however, that is set to change as the refinery and petrochemical integrated development (rapid) project gains traction. rapid is a part of the 20,000-acre pengerang integrated petroleum complex (pipc), which is poised to be a regional downstream oil and gas hub. the complex will have a capacity of 300,000 barrels per day and is expected to be commissioned by early 2019. work is already underway at rapid. up to 70,000 people will be involved in its construction and when it is operational, it will employ more than 4,000 people. things are moving very fast. petronas has awarded many packages in engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning. in the meantime, we have received a lot of enquiries from petronas and other parties involved in the entire project on providing accommodation and housing, says soam. ijm land has embarked on a massive upgrading of the area, which is estimated to cost rm30 million to rm40 million. previously, there was only a two-lane road going into the site. we are now increasing it to a four-lane one, soam says. we are also building a new entryway with a new arch. we are also tearing down the golf club building and rebuilding it, since it is a simple structure. all the hotel rooms are already upgraded, so now we are working on the clubhouse and restaurants. the group is also upgrading the 30 units of townhouses built by arab malaysian finance that have remained unsold. these are for executive-level staff [of pipc] like supervisors and engineers. we are now refurbishing the units to rent them out, with the intention of selling them eventually. there has been a lot of enquiries on accommodation, so we know there is pent-up demand. they are really fussy about accommodation, so we have to do up the units nicely, says soam. launch of phase 1 ijm land is planning to launch the first phase of its township, fairway golf villas, before year-end. it will comprise 59 villas with land areas of 5,488 sq ft to 13,765 sq ft and built-ups of 2,997 sq ft to 4,415 sq ft. prices are pegged from rm1.4 million to rm2.2 million. the villas come with green features such as large windows, rainwater harvesting systems, roof insulation and green tinted glass to reduce heat, porous openings for cross ventilation and sun-shading louvres to minimise glare. in addition, the homes will also have long balconies that provide views of the golf course and porches that accommodate up to three cars. some of the villas will also have a pavilion and larger outdoor space. it will be a gated and guarded precinct with round-the-clock patrols. there will also be an alarm system and perimeter fencing for each villa. the dining rooms and master bedrooms will be installed with panic buttons that are linked to the guardhouse. private previews will be held on oct 16 and 17 here, while an exclusive preview will be held in singapore on oct 18 and 19, says soam. future phases of the development will offer cluster homes, semi-detached houses, zero-lot bungalows, bungalows, townhouses, and shopoffices. also available will be commercial and retail elements. sebana cove resort will also take advantage of the shanti forest reserve and river banks of the shanti and sebina rivers to provide a more natural setting for its homes. the properties on the river banks and fronting the sea will no doubt fetch a premium. meanwhile, the rest of the land has been earmarked for mass housing. the township is expected to be mostly low in density, with about five homes per acre. the entire township is expected to take 10 to 15 years to develop. strategic move as the market takes a breather  no thanks to cooling measures in both sides of the causeway, the tit-for-tat raising of toll rates by malaysia and singapore, the oversupply of properties in johor and falling property prices in singapore  what prompted ijm land to launch this year? i was at a property talk recently and one of the speakers advised us to sit tight for the next two years. how can we do that? even unlisted property players must continue to sell because they have holding costs, soam says with amusement. he also shrugs off concerns over singapores cooling property market and its potential ripple effects in johor, arguing that prices are still competitive in the state. even after the drop in hdb flat prices, it is still s$1,000 psf [in singapore]. we are still a lot cheaper if you compare landed homes with apartments, and we are not in medini or other flagships [that have been] affected by the glut, he points out. it should be noted that sebana cove resort is not ijm lands first venture in johor. the group has had piecemeal launches in the southern state, such as its gated and guarded landed residential nusa duta scheme in skudai, suria mas suites in larkin and epic apartments in tampoi. ijm land had also tied up with jkg (johor) sdn bhd to develop a mixed-use development near johor baru. however, sebana cove resort will be ijm lands boldest venture in johor as the group continues to adopt a conservative stance in the southern state. still, soam believes that landed homes are a safer option in the state, as they are more sought-after, especially by owner-occupiers. according to soam, ijm land had initially wanted to market the project as a lifestyle-living option for retirees in singapore. however, there were no takers because the bungalows were far from other attractions, as the senai-desaru highway had not been built yet. some may feel that the township is a good distance from johor baru, the causeway and the second link. however, soam notes that the township is very close to the tanjung belungkor and tanjung pengelih ferry terminals. it is a 30-minute boat ride to the changi point ferry terminal, followed by a 10-minute journey to changi airport. the tanjung belungkor ferry terminal has facilities for cars. in fact, star cruise luxury liners used to dock here and bring cars, he says. when tan sri kong cho ha was minister of transport, his ministry had promised that there would be car ferries this year, but that did not happen. so now we are chasing the ministry to do it. we expect the car ferry service from tanjung belungkor to changi point to start in early 2016. johor baru is an hours drive away via the senai-desaru and coastal highways. this is almost half the time it used to take via the coastal and trunk roads, soam adds. as we also have water taxis as alternative transport to singapore, we will not be affected by the toll hikes and imposition of vehicle entry permits [in malaysia], he says. nasa city also on ijm lands plate is nasa city, a 294-acre freehold development near johor baru. located along the north-south expressway, it is 15 minutes from johor baru. nasa city is developed by nasa land sdn bhd, a 50:50 joint venture between ijm land and jkg land (jb) sdn bhd (formerly known as aspirasi ratna sdn bhd). jkg lands shareholders are low-profile tycoon tan sri robert tan hua choon, puan sri ong poo choi, tan hua chan and tan ching. the development will comprise serviced apartments, bungalows, a mall and offices. the centara residences serviced apartments will be launched this month. the two 25-storey towers will house 428 units with built-ups of 800 sq ft to 1,000 sq ft. prices range from rm400,000 to rm500,000, or rm500 psf. the development will come with an infinity pool, wading pool, reflexology pool, barbecue area, childrens playground, landscaped terrace, garden, gymnasium, sauna, changing rooms and water feature. according to soam, nasa land plans to launch the serviced apartments after the tabling of budget 2015. hopefully, the markets appetite for real estate would have returned by then. \nthis article first appeared in city & country, the edge malaysia

industry, has seen its revenue more than double to rm407.9 million from rm192.6 million over the past three years. its net profit has nearly tripled to rm33.6 million from rm12.1 million for the period.  the stock has rallied from 72.4 sen in january 2011 to rm3.57 last friday, after it hit a historical high of rm4.22 in july. how long will the stellar financial performance and share price rally last? its ceo datuk kamarul redzuan muhamed targets uzma to sustain its revenue growth pace of 40% in the next three years, at least.  besides the rm1.8 billion order book that will keep income flowing in for three years, his confidence hinges on its expansion plans, including acquisitions that have been made and a few that are in the pipeline. kamarul, who founded the company, stresses that uzmas three core businesses  geoscience and petroleum engineering, drilling and well services, and production, operation and optimisation services  are expected to expand significantly over the next few years, allowing the group to embark on special projects such as brownfield rejuvenation and risk service contracts (rscs). we plan to expand our drilling and well services significantly. we plan to inject the bulk of our capital expenditure from our recent rights issue [worth rm78 million] to grow this segment and become a regional player, kamarul tells the edge. he discloses that uzma is eyeing at least two more rscs from petroliam nasional bhd (petronas). we plan to take on more rscs before we hit our resource and cash limits. at the moment, we still have the capacity to take on two to four rscs, he says. kamarul acknowledges that rscs are a high-risk game. but uzmas expertise in enhanced and improved oil recovery has given the company advantages in developing marginal oilfields, which require high efficiency. in fact, uzma was earlier hired by petronas to conduct studies on the reserves of the domestic marginal oilfields. we are already providing the services for these projects and although we already have good sustainable recurring income growth, we will be able to see further upside if we take on these special projects, he says, adding that the projects will give uzma longer earnings visibility. uzma took on its first rsc in april with foreign partner eq petroleum developments malaysia sdn bhd to develop tanjung baram field off the coast of sarawak. uzma has 30% equity interest in the nine-year contract worth rm326 million while eq petroleum holds the remaining 70%. our plan is to drill two wells and tie them to an existing platform for processing. we plan to get the first production by the end of the first quarter next year and i am confident about it as tanjung baram is a proven field, says kamarul. although the first production is expected to come in 11 months after the signing of the agreement, kamarul says uzma obtained a two-month extension due to weather factors. uzma is expected to start drilling in january instead of next month. nonetheless, kamarul, who is also the single largest shareholder of the company, stresses that rscs are just one of uzmas core activities. he points out that the recent acquisitions of well services (thailand) ltd and mmsvs group holdings ltd for a total of rm95 million have added the missing jigsaw pieces to the companys well services. we now have the complete value chain in well services. and this is the division that will earn uzma recurring income. all oil wells need to be serviced regularly. most wells are aged between five and eight years and this requires high maintenance. the acquisitions [in thailand] now give us the capability to take on a [full] range of well services projects, says kamarul. he adds that the acquisitions brought in new technology to the group, adding a fleet of modern hydraulic workover units (hwus) and a truck mounted service rig. uzma has the largest fleet of hwus in asean. furthermore, the takeover of premier enterprise corp (m) sdn bhd (pec), which is involved in the supply of chemicals for oil recovery, is another feather in its cap. the acquisition, which expands the groups market share in the business to more than 50%, is expected to be the next phase of growth for uzma. being a subsea services company, uzma is also looking to win contracts for brownfield rejuvenation. we have done several studies on brownfields and we believe that these projects fit into our portfolio, says kamarul. brownfield rejuvenation projects provide uzma with a better contracting strategy as we get paid for the barrels that we produce as well as the subsea services required for the projects, he adds.  kamarul points out that the key to rejuvenating brownfields is to repair the wells. when the wells are not producing, they become idle. we have our own internal solution for this, as we have the full value chain. winning a brownfield project will make uzma a regional player in oil and gas upstream services. we are looking forward to participating in brownfield projects. whether we win the contracts or not, well live to fight another day. he adds that although uzma prefers brownfields located in malaysia, as it has already conducted the relevant studies and has locally-based assets, it is also looking overseas. \nthis article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on september 22-28, 2014."}, "276": {"date_posted": "7/10/2014",

property counters are worrying in view of the skyrocketing local property prices, said tan teng boo, founder and managing director (md) of capital dynamics asset management sdn bhd. the outspoken local fund manager noted that overall, the local o&g sector carries more sell calls than buy ratings at the moment. the valuation [of o&g firms] is very rich [and the] profit margins they are earning are not sustainable. [with the] price they [investors] are paying and what they get in return, it doesnt make sense, tan toldthe edge financial dailyin a recent interview. however, he noted that petronas dagangan bhd is a different counter compared with other o&g firms as it is more of a marketing, retailing and distribution channel. although he acknowledged that petronas dagangans valuation is slightly on the high side, he said the downstream o&g products retailer and marketer has done a good job in competing with o&g firms such as british petroleum (bp), royal dutch shell plc (shell) and esso. icapital.biz bhd, a closed-end fund managed by capital dynamics, had 7,100 shares in petronas dagangan valued at rm171,536, as ofjune 25this year. it sold 892,900 shares during the financial year endedmay 31last year, netting it rm23.33 million,accordingto its 2014 annual report. when the price [of petronas dagangan] becomes attractive again, we will definitely relook. tan said local property prices are worrying and by virtue of that property stocks should be worrying too. bursa malaysia, which has a price-to-earnings ratio of 17 times to 18 times, is also not attractive at the moment due to its high valuation, tan said, noting that we wont be having so much cash otherwise. asked about his top stock picks, he said at this moment its hard to find a stock that is specifically attractive to us, and added that the company would hold on to its rm250 million cash hoard for the time being. we need a little bit of patience and the day will come when there will be a lot of attractive stocks to be bought, tan said. apart from petronas dagangan, icapital.biz owns 19 million shares (2.89%) and 3.48 million shares (2.75%) in padini holdings bhd and tong herr resources bhd respectively. at the right price, we will take profit from padini, he said, noting that tong herrs earnings have been going up. on its funds performance, the net asset value (nav) per share rose 2% from rm2.99 in june 1 last year to rm3.05 on may 31 this year. as at oct 1, its nav was at rm3.06. in the same period, its funds market price rose 5% from rm2.40 to rm2.52 on the back of an increase of 5% in the fbm klci. its counter climbed 0.41% to close at rm2.43 last friday, with a market capitalisation of rm340.2 million. on another note, tan said he is not concerned about the substantial stake that city of london investment management co ltd owns in his company, which stands at 9.88% or 13.83 million shares according to icapital.bizs 2014 annual report. this is a free market. the most important thing is that as a fund manager we manage the funds to the best of our ability. they do their usual company visits like any other analysts will do, he said, adding that while their stake is sizeable, the remaining 90% plus stake is also substantial, so we have to make them [the majority] happy. as to a possible tie-up between european hedge fund laxey partner ltd and city of london, tan said its very hard to tell if they are in collaboration or not, adding that he had done a background check on the latter, but found nothing conclusive. it is believed that laxey partner attempted to take over icapital.biz in 2012 but failed to grab any seat on its board. it then ceased to be a substantial shareholder on nov 21 last year after the failed bid.  this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on

price of rm19.64: petdag is the leading marketer of downstream petroleum products, with a market share around 42%. it operates the largest retail station network in malaysia with more than 1,000 petronas petrol stations. petdag is the market leader in the commercial gas (market share: around 68%) and liquefied petroleum gas (lpg) (around 57% market share) segments in malaysia. it comes in second in both the retail (around 3%) and lubricants (around 13%) segments. in 2012, petdag ventured overseas and it now has a presence in thailand (lubricants), vietnam (lpg) and the philippines (lubricant and lpg). petdags share price has retreated 36% so far from the peak of rm31.82 on dec 31, 2013, no thanks to the two malaysia airlines air disasters within the last six months. even then, petdag is still trading at 24 times price-earnings ratio currently, which is at a 55% premium to the klci as opposed to the 150% premium from the peak. it has been trading at a premium since february 2011 when the company started its high dividend payout of 89% to 95% for three years from, below 60% earlier. the question now is how much premium investors are willing to pay for the stock. historical data shows that petdag has been trading at a 79% premium since february 2011, and at 89%, 69% and 50% premiums for the three-year, four-year and five-year means. while petdag is expecting a weak financial year 2014 ending dec 31 (fy14) due to higher operating cost, stronger business volumes are set to drive its earnings higher, to be led by the retail segment. we expect petdags earnings to grow at 4.5% three-year compound annual growth rate in fy13 to fy16e. although gone are the days of distributing exceptionally high dividend payout of 85% to 94%, we still expect generous payout of 70% over fy14e to fy17e given its strong operating cash flow generating ability of above rm1 billion a year. this implies a decent net yield of 2.6% to 3.1%. this is also backed by a minimum 50% dividend payout policy. although we like its business model and generous earnings payout, we believe petdag is fairly priced at the moment, although its share price has retreated 36% from the peak. even then, it is not a stock to be ignored given its parent is petroliam nasional bhd and its status as an index stock. in our opinion, this stock will remain as a core holding for investors portfolio benchmarking purposes. in addition, the share price downside is likely to be capped by steady earnings growth as the fear of declining jet fuel demand is overdone since it only makes up about 10% of the groups revenue. as such, we are initiating coverage on petdag with a market perform rating and a target price of rm19.64, which implies calendar year 2015 22.7 times price-earnings ratio and around 50% premium to the market valuation.  kenanga research, sept 10  \nthis article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on september 11, 2014. \n"}, "289": {"date_posted": "3/9/2014",

has won a rm100 million construction contract, came down on profit taking this morning, after rising in early trade. the counter was down 6 sen or 1.94% at rm3.04, as at 12.25 pm. it had risen to as high as rm3.12 at 9.12am, but investors resorted to taking profit thereafter.  some 540,000 shares changed hands. meb told bursa malaysia yesterday, that it has bagged a rm100 million contract from basf petronas chemicals sdn bhd to build a new aroma chemical complex and relevant facilities for the lemongrass project, located in kuantan, pahang. \"the job will commence immediately and will be completed in two years. the contract is expected to contribute positively to the earnings and net assets of muhibbah group, for the current and future financial years, said the company. in a note to clients today, alliance dbs research sdn bhd said that meb needs to secure more jobs to provide a comfortable degree of earnings visibility. \"we are cautious on muhibbahs thinning orderbook balance,\" said alliance dbs analyst jeremy goh, adding that at a cover of only 0.9 times financial year revenue, more sizable job wins are needed to provide a comfortable degree of earnings visibility for the group. \"with the recent (rm100 million) job at hand, we estimate year-to-date orderbook replenishment for its construction division to stand at rm221 million. this would translate to an overall orderbook balance (including cranes and shipyard) of rm1.8 billion,\" he said. goh noted there were several potential job wins in the pipeline, including contracts from rapid, where meb has tendered rm3 billion to rm4 billion via subcontracts to the main engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning (epcc) contractors. \"however, we caution that securing these contracts hinges on the main epcc contractors that meb has partnered with, to win the jobs to begin with,\" he said. nevertheless, alliance dbs is maintaining its \"hold\" call on the stock, with an unchanged target price of rm3.20, based on 15 times of financial year 2015 earnings. the research house projected meb's revenue for fy14 and fy15 at rm1.52 billion and rm1.56 billion, and net profit at rm75 million and rm89 million respectively. meanwhile, kenanga ib research retained its \"outperform\" rating on meb, as the contract value is within its fy14 new jobs assumptions. \"we are maintaining our sum of parts (sop) derived target price of rm3.55. this implies forward price to earnings ratio (per) of 14.6 times fy15 earnings per share (eps), which is still within mid-cap sized construction peers historical per range of 12-15 times,\" said kenanga analyst iqbal zainal. \"we continue to like muhibbah, due to its unique business structure that offers flexibility in infrastructure, marine engineering and o&g jobs, its ability to leverage on its internationally-recognized favelle favcos brand name, and long-term earnings visibility, backed by stable and growing recurring income from its concessions,\" he said. \"we are positive on muhibbahs job flows. this is the fourth o&g related contract secured by the group, so far this year. including this contract, muhibbahs ytd job wins amounted to rm221 million or 32% of our rm700 million new jobs assumption for fy14. \"we believe the remaining (about rm400 to rm500 million) new orders will be secured by the group before end of fy14, and are likely from petronas and rapid project,\" he added. he said muhibbah's current order book stands at rm1.91 billion, comprising rm865 million from construction division, rm1.11 billion from crane and rm45 million from the shipyard division, which will keep muhibbah busy until 2016.

investment bank (june 17): we expect indonesia to remain the main driver for ijmps overall fresh fruit bunch (ffb) output growth, underpinned by more planted areas reaching maturity (5,000ha to 8,000ha a year over the next three years). we projected overall ffb production to grow 10% to 13% in fy03/15-17 (versus 9.3% to 10% previously), underpinned by a 26% to 43% increase in ffb production in indonesia over the next three years. we are raising our fy03/15-16 net profit forecasts by 5.3% and 12% respectively, largely to account for higher ffb yield and lower production cost assumptions for its indonesian operations. based on our sensitivity analysis, every rm100 per tonne increase in our average cpo price assumption will raise our fy03/15-17 net profit forecasts by 8.3% to 8.6%. we raise our target price on the stock by 12.1% to rm3.81, based on unchanged 17 times revised fy03/16 eps of 22.4 sen. although we like its strong balance sheet and young age profile, we believe ijmps

the p3 alliance on june 17 as it thinks the proposed vessel-pooling accord will restrict competition on the busiest asia-europe routes. the p3 members (maersk, msc and cma cgm) have announced that the p3 plan will now be scrapped. despite its solid earnings delivery and strong non-p3 volume growth, westports share price performance has been lacklustre since its listing in october 2013 because of concerns about p3. given the latest development, we believe westports will see an overdue re-rating. it trades at an implied forward per of 18 times, below its regional peers average of 22 times. we are reversing the potential impact and raising our full-year container volume growth to 10% and 9% for fy14 and fy15 respectively. consequently, our fy14-fy16 eps forecasts are raised by 2%, 4% and 4% respectively and our discounted cash flow-derived target price is nudged up to rm2.85, indicating a forward per of 19 times. top glove corp bhd\ntarget price: rm4.48 hold\ncimb research (june 17): top gloves 9mfy14 net profit came in below expectations, at 69.2% and 66% of our and consensus full-year forecasts respectively. meanwhile, 9mfy14 revenue dropped 3.9% y-o-y owing to lower selling prices while core net profit declined 4.6% because of the poorer performance from china and the higher effective tax rate. thus, we are reducing our fy14-fy16 net profit forecasts by 5% to 8%, trimming our target price, still based on 14.5 times per (about 20% discount to hartalega). we maintain a hold on top glove but prefer kossan. top glove declared its first dividend for fy14, a single-tier dividend per share of 7 sen, in line with our forecast. we think that top glove has been able to contain its operating costs quite well through aggressive cost-optimisation initiatives. this can be seen from the stronger ebitda margin, although it was impacted by the large foreign exchange loss in 9mfy14. the higher ebitda margin was also driven by higher sales contribution from nitrile. sapurakencana

group announced an acquisition of the remaining 20% in f&b nutrition sdn bhd (f&b) for rm112.9 million via the issuance of 39.753 million shares at rm2.84 apiece. the price tag implies a valuation of

the groups huge borrowings of rm388.2 million (as at march 31, 2014) against that amount leaves us with a residual of rm658.5 million, valuing can-one at rm3.43 per share on the enlarged share base.

(thailand) co ltd (somt), for a total cash consideration of us$162.9 million (rm522.9 million). the disposals are expected to be completed this month. the disposals do not come as a surprise, as sime darby sold off its malaysian power plant in april for rm300 million in a bid to dispose of its non-core assets. we maintain our sum-of-parts (sop)-based fair value of rm10.40 and our neutral recommendation. although we are still positive on the plantation sector as a whole, the weaknesses at sime darbys heavy equipment and motor division could be a threat to earnings growth, despite its sensitivity to crude palm oil (cpo) prices. hence, we advocate shifting away from the more integrated players to the purer planters, which would benefit more significantly from cpo price movements. sarawak cable bhd\nfair value: rm1.70 hold \namresearch (june 17): we place our fair value rating for scable under review, pending further details on the proposed acquisitions that were announced

the offer will fortify scable as the leading cable manufacturer in the country with an estimated market share of more than 50%. we understand that following the acquisition, scable will essentially supply all the cables for the 500kv job on a consolidated basis. the acquiree companies are two of the top suppliers in peninsular malaysia. margins are likely to be similar with that of scables existing power cable business. note that non-independent and non-executive director datuk seri hng bok san is the controlling shareholder of hng. if accepted, we expect the share sale agreement to be

will seek shareholders approval for a series of restructuring exercises, which will see a backdoor listing of hlis infrastructure business into narra. we see a trading buy opportunity as there could be significant upside to our sum-of-parts (sop) valuation should narras current implied valuation hold up. the implied post-exercise value of narra at rm4.49 per hli share is well above our rm2.30 for hli. narras implied post-exercise market cap is rm2 billion, implying a share price of rm4.16. while we doubt narras present lofty valuation can sustain after the exercise, we acknowledge that it could fetch a valuation that is significantly above our appraised valuation. should narras valuation hold up after the restructuring, our adjusted sop valuation and target price for hli would be rm10.39 and rm9.26 respectively. this compares with our target price of rm6.86, which assumes narra shares at rm2.30 per hli share and a 20% holding company discount to our sop valuation of rm5.70 for hlis remaining assets. alliance financial group bhd \ntarget price: rm5.40 buy\naffin investment bank (june 17): we are of the view that afgs stock price decline is overdone since news of alliance

management. management is striving to achieve key performance indicators for fy15 by replicating fy14s loan growth of 14.1% y-o-y in fy15e, and achieving a higher return on equity of above 14% in fy15e. with the share price correction, which has provided investors an upside of 15% to our target price of rm5.40, we revise our rating from add to buy. we continue to like the stock, given the attractive dividends, with a net yield of 4.8% to 5.8% in fy15-fy17, subsequent to a slight increase in the payout ratio from 50% to 60% (which was announced during the last results quarter). management is more proactive and will continue to focus on achieving near-term strategic priorities, such as a 30% non-interest income ratio. malaysia airports holdings bhd\ntarget price: rm10.55 buy\nhong leong investment bank (june 16): mahb released weak statistics for may, showing passenger movement growth of only 2.1% y-o-y, owing to the impact of the mh370 crisis and kidnappings in sabah, capacity rationalisation (especially on domestic routes) and high base effect (strong traffic during the election in may 2013). nevertheless, year-to-date passenger growth remained strong at 13.5% y-o-y versus hlibs forecasted +12.8% y-o-y for fy14. klia experienced a decrease of -11% on china sector routes alone (about 10% of the overall passenger movement) after the mh370 and kidnapping of chinese incidents. we believe mas as the main airline operator in klias main terminal building (-3.2% y-o-y in may) severely affected mahb. since mid-may, local airlines  mas, airasia group (including airasia x) and malindo  have been aggressive in their marketing campaigns to fill up increasing flight capacity. hence, we expect a recovery in june-july (impact normalisation) and mahb remains the major beneficiary. this story first appeared in the edge weekly edition of june 23-29, 2014.

(may 3): the edge weekly, in its latest edition has raised the spectre of a slowdown in construction contract flow and a cooling property market that may have an adverse impact on shares of these companies and questions if it was time for investors to take their money off the table. the edge weekly in its cover story said that the rm200 billion worth of jobs in the pipeline for the next 20 years had been carrots for investors and driven up valuations. however, as the government nears the end of its fiscal rope and the property market slows down, investors will have to reassess the potential risk of delays in these mega projects, it said. it said that although the short and mid-term fundamentals of most of the construction players are still intact and they have sizeable order books to keep them busy until the end of next year, the problem is that many of the mega-projects in the pipeline would not be awarded anytime soon. citing gadang holdings bhd major shareholder and managing director tan sri kok onn, the edge said that the only major projects that will go ahead this year were those of petronas in the form of rapid and rapid phase 2. it said the rm60 billion rapid (refinery and petrochemical integrated development) project that falls under the pengerang integrated petroleum complex recently received the final investment decision from petroliam nasional bhd and kok expects several of its packages to be awarded in the next six months, including the co-generation power plant and the infrastructure jobs that gadang was bidding for. however, the bulk of the rapid projects cost will go to the oil and gas players and equipment suppliers with only a small slice for civil and infrastructure works. thus, some economists are expecting the construction sector to grow at a slower pace than the consensus forecast of 10% this year, it said. the weekly said infrastructure projects accounted for 20.4% of new construction contracts in 2013, down from an average of 31.4% from 2007 to 2013. looking ahead, no tenders will be awarded for the massive rm25 billion second klang valley mass rapid transit line soon, although the cabinet approved the project last month, it added. the weekly noted that project manager mrt corp has said tenders for the rail project will only be called next year after the public display, environmental impact assessment, land acquisitions and fine-tuning of the alignment have been completed. it is highly unlikely that a project this size and with high multiplier value will be scrapped, but a lengthy delay could be costly. players like gamuda bhd and mmc corp bhd have invested heavily in 10 tunnel-boring machines for line one. the equipment makes the mmc-gamuda partnership a strong contender for the next tunnelling package, but it could mean expensive holding costs if there is no timely deployment of the machines, say industry observers. following the governments cooling measures, the residential property market is expected to see a slowdown. and given that 30% of new contracts came from residential projects last year, any weakening will have a substantial impact on the sector. the weekly also quoted rhb research institutes chief economist lim chee sing as saying that potential homebuyers were also facing hurdles in securing bank financing with loan rejection rates potentially as high as 30% based on recent reports. as a result, there could be a delay in the rolling- out of several mega property developments planned in the klang valley because these are highly dependent on market demand to get off the ground, it said. the rm50 billion development by the epfs wholly-owned kwasa land sdn bhd on the rubber research institute of malaysias (rrim) 2,330 acres in the heart of the klang valley could be the largest to be affected, noted the weekly. however, despite the slowdown in the near term, longer-term support for the industry remains intact, said the weekly. looking ahead, the fundamental drivers remain supportive of the construction sector amid continued fiscal consolidation. progress in existing projects in the transport, utility, highway, power plant and oil and gas sectors as well

fbm klcis gain of 9% over the same period, indicating strong interest in the sector amid expectation of a steady stream of contracts, which would boost their order books. so, will the rally go on? asked the weekly. despite several analysts expressing bullish views on the sector, the weekly explained that not all was rosy for construction stocks when one looked beyond the long list of construction jobs in the pipeline. as the rally in property and oil and gas stocks appears to have lost steam this year, some say investors may turn to the construction sector because of its

{"date_posted": "30/4/2014", "title": "pantechs growth prospects intact", "article": " pantech group holdings bhds (rm1.00) earnings results for the fourth quarter ended feb 28 of financial year 2014 (4qfy14) were in line with our expectations.  recall that we had previously pared our earnings forecast due to slower domestic project execution as well as the impact from us anti-dumping duties levied on the country in october 2013. as a result for the two above-mentioned factors, pantechs earnings in the second half (2hfy14) were weaker than that in 1hfy14.  sales in the latest 4qfy14 dropped 18.3% year-on-year (y-o-y) and 2.5% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) to rm127.8 million. for the full year, sales were down 9.8% to rm574.9 million  led by a 19.4% decline in trading sales. manufacturing sales managed a 4.8% gain, thanks to a robust 1hfy14, before the anti-dumping duties came into effect. with this increase, manufacturing accounted for a higher 46% of total sales in fy14, up from 40% in fy13. net profit for fy14 was up just 1.4% to rm55.8 million. again, earnings for the full year were dragged down by a weaker 2h  net profit grew 9% y-o-y in 1hfy14 but fell 5% y-o-y in 2hfy14. positively, net profit in 4qfy14 recovered to rm14.6 million, up from rm12.1 million in 3qfy14  despite the slight 2.5% decline in sales. we attribute the better margin to a more favourable product mix.  better margins on higher value added products for instance, since the us imposed anti-dumping duties on stainless steel pipes, pantech has shifted production to fittings, which have better margins. production for the latter has since quadrupled. as a result, although the anti-dumping duties are a setback for the stainless steel plant, it still managed to generate a small profit in fy14  compared to start-up losses in fy13. the stainless steel plant is currently running at roughly 80% capacity. sales at uk-based nautic steel also carry higher margins on value-added niche products like copper nickel and nickel alloy pipes and fittings. the company has also focused on producing higher margin products  such as long bends  at the carbon steel plant for both local and export markets. expanding global footprint notably, pantech has made good inroads in the export markets. its products, led by those manufactured by nautic, are approved by many of the oil majors. export sales accounted for 49% of total sales in fy14, up from 31% in fy11. stronger margins and earnings from manufacturing offset lower contributions from the trading arm in fy14. aside from lower sales, the slow project execution in the domestic oil and gas sector also resulted in a less favourable product mix for pantechs trading unit as it turned to other sectors to make up the slack. positive longer-term outlook despite the near-term setback  due to reasons mentioned above  we remain sanguine on pantechs longer-term growth prospects. the company is cautiously optimistic that project flow in the domestic oil and gas market will regain traction in 2h of 2014  rejuvenated by petroliam nasional bhds approval of the final investment decision for the us$26 billion (rm84.8 billion) pengerang integrated complex (pic) project.  for instance, barakah offshore petroleum has just won a rm260 million contract to lay gas pipeline to pic. work for the contract is to commence immediately. the oil and gas sector remains a key focus area under the economic transformation programme. petronas is expected to spend over rm300 billion in capital expenditure between 2011 and 2015.  crude oil prices have been holding steady for the past few years. this will continue to support global oil and gas exploration and production activities. expanding capacity on expectations of rising demand to cater to expectations of rising demand, including that from the pic, pantech is planning to buy more equipment for the carbon steel plant this year. this will raise production capacity to 21,000 tonnes per annum, from the current 18,500 tonnes. the plant is currently running at full capacity. with the new equipment, pantech can further expand its product range and strengthen its position as the largest one-stop centre for pipes, fittings and flow control products in the country. last year, pantech acquired a second plot of land near nautics existing factory and has installed new equipment to expand product range, which will include nickel alloy items such as duplex and super duplex. utilisation stands at about 75% following the capacity increase  supportive of growth over the next year or two. the expansion also includes extra warehousing space.  capital expenditure is now estimated at about rm24 million in fy15, lower than that in fy14 but higher than our previous estimate  after taking into account spending for new equipment for the carbon steel plant. growth to gain traction in fy16 we forecast slower sales growth of about 6% for fy15, with gradually stronger demand going into the second half of the year. sales growth should pick up in fy16, estimated at about 15%.  net profit growth, however, is expected to outpace sales increase on expectations that the margins improvement in 2hfy14 will continue into fy15.  thus, net profit is estimated at rm62.4 million, up 12% for the current financial year, and to expand further to rm73.7 million in fy16.  pantechs valuations remain attractive relative to the oil and gas sector as well as the broader market. the stock is now trading at price-earnings multiples of 9.1 and 7.7 times our estimated earnings for fy15 and fy16 respectively.  the company has some 74.8 million warrants  with exercise price of 60 sen and a long expiry, in december 2020  and 34.3 million irredeemable convertible unsecured loan stock outstanding. even on a fully diluted basis, the stock is still modestly valued at roughly 10.2 and 8.7 times our estimated earnings for fy15 and fy16 respectively. strengthening balance sheet supportive of dividends of note, pantechs balance has been strengthening over the past year, with major expansions completed  the acquisition of nautic and commissioning of the stainless steel plant. gearing dropped to 31% at end-fy14, from 47% in fy13. with improved cash flow, we forecast gearing to fall further over the next few years  barring any new acquisition. as such, we expect pantech can comfortably maintain a fairly generous dividend payout. dividends totalled 4.4 sen per share in fy14, or equivalent to about 45% of net profit.  assuming a similar payout level, dividends will total some five sen per share for the current financial year and 5.9 sen in fy16. these will earn shareholders higher than market average net yields of 5% and 5.9% at the current share price for the two years respectively. in all, we remain upbeat that pantech can offer shareholders prospects of longer-term growth on top of attractive yields. note: this report is brought to you by asia analytica sdn

(petronas) final investment decision on the refinery and petrochemical integrated development (rapid) project, which is expected to be announced in 2q2014. they gained as much as 25.6%, between nov 05 and jan 13. the companys warrant, dialog-wa, did even better over the same period, climbing 106% and hence proving to be a cheaper proxy for the underlying share. it is worth noting that dialog-wa, which has a strike price of rm2.40 and a conversion ratio of one to one, has seen greater trading activity and a substantial decline in its premium to the underlying share, over the past year.  based on its closing price of rm1.26 on jan 13, the warrant is trading at a 7.65% premium to the mother share, as opposed to 20.23% a year ago. based on maybank ib researchs target price of rm3.90 for dialog, in a jan 09 report, the stock theoretically has an upside potential of 14.7%, based on its closing price of rm3.40 on jan 13. assuming zero premium, dialog-wa may rise to rm1.50 apiece (rm3.90-rm2.40), if the mother share meets the research houses target price. with a decision on rapid expected soon, there could be continued buying interest in dialog-wa, which has three more years to run, before expiring on feb 02, 2017. dialogs existing tank terminal operation in pengerang, johor, which is the site of the rapid project, is expected to report a higher contribution to the companys earnings, in the coming years, says maybank ib research. construction of the rm1.7 billion phase 1 of the independent terminal project, covering 150 acres with a 1.3 million cu m storage capacity, is on track to meet its 1q2014 deadline. phase 2 will likely involve lng tank terminals and is expected to commence operations in 2017. the research house adds that phase 3 of the project will likely accommodate oil majors, refineries and petrochemical operators, operating under the rapid project. getting the green light for rapid, is a key re-rating catalyst for the stock, it says. in a jan 06 note, kenanga research says, a positive decision on rapid will continue to spur interest in downstream oil and gas operators, such as onshore fabricators, tank terminal operators and process equipment players. it also upgraded dialogs target price from rm3.28 to rm3.90, on expectations that the company is likely to go ahead with the liquefied natural gas (lng) terminal development in pengerang. in anticipation of a more positive outlook for pengerang phase 2a, we have upgraded our target price for dialog, to rm3.90, on the inclusion of 720,000 cu m of lng capacity, it says. this

various business segments, rising international stature and its growing focus on the oil and gas (o&g) sector, making the stock a good proxy to the sectors buoyant growth. the groups more cyclical earnings from infrastructure construction, cranes and shipbuilding are complemented by stable concession income from the airports in cambodia and road maintenance contract in malaysia. muhibbahs earnings will be underpinned by its rm1.82 billion order book, of which 60% is for oil and gas-related projects. the crane unit, favelle favco, in particular is seeing strong growth in order book and earnings, with 30% growth in net profit to rm61.7 million in 2013. we expect muhibbah to post net profit of rm99.7 million in 2014 and rm110.8 million in 2015, with earnings per share of 23.6 sen for 2014 and 26.2 sen for 2015. at rm2.40, the stocks price-earnings ratio of 10.2 times for 2014 and 9.1 times for 2015 are attractive, especially relative to its growth prospects, oil and gas and construction peers, and as lower-cost proxies to the o&g sector. as a comparison, large cap o&g stocks like sapurakencana petroleum bhd and bumi armada bhd are currently trading at about 20 times earnings for 2014, while smaller ones like perisai petroleum bhd are at 16 times. most major construction stocks are trading at around 12 times earnings for 2014  although those with property divisions will likely see a dip in earnings in 2015 with the current property slowdown. 2013 results ahead of expectations muhibbahs full year results for 2013 were better than our expectation, and marked a strong turnaround from 2012 when the company fell into the red due to provisions for the asia petroleum hub (aph) project. full year pre-tax profit came in at rm134 million, 8% above our forecast of rm124 million, while net profit of rm85.2 million was 20% above our original forecast of rm71.2 million. by comparison, the group posted pre-tax and net losses of rm35 million and rm93.2 million, respectively, in 2012 due to provisions for aph. revenue for 2013 declined 27.6% from rm2.63 billion to rm1.9 billion. notwithstanding the better overall performance due to the absence of one-off aph provisions, we estimate earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) in 2013 declined 23.4% from rm236.2 million to rm180.8 million, although overall ebitda margins improved from 9% to 9.5%. this was largely due to the 27.6% drop in revenue following the completion of several large projects, notably the south klang valley expressway, as civil works typically yield lower margins. share of associates increased 5.3% from rm44.2 million to rm46.5 million, reflecting continued growth in its concession business, notably the cambodian airports and malaysian road maintenance concessions. as at feb 21, muhibbahs outstanding order book stood at rm1.83 billion, down 14% from rm2.13 billion in november 2013. this comprised rm719 million from infrastructure construction, rm1.064 billion from cranes and rm47 million from shipyard. of this, 27.7% is in malaysia and the rest overseas, a testament to the groups growing international stature. a first and final dividend of 4.5 sen has been proposed, giving shareholders a yield of 1.9%. good prospects for more jobs among muhibbahs major outstanding contracts are the wiggins island coal terminal export project in australia (outstanding order book rm192 million), noise barriers and enclosures for mrt corp (rm147 million), catering facility for the new doha international airport (rm105 million), government buildings in putrajaya (rm47 million), refurbishment of the terminal buildings at phnom penh and siem reap airports (rm83 million) and steel structure works for the petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) lng 9 project in sarawak (rm30 million). going forward, o&g projects are likely to feature more with the award to muhibbah in june 2013 of a licence by petronas as an approved supplier for offshore facilities construction  major onshore fabrication. with its complete package of capabilities in building ships, cranes, fabricated structures, pipelines, terminals, tanks and other related works, the group is positioning itself to garner a larger slice of the national oil companys captial expenditure (capex). petronas is expected to spend rm300 billion in capex over the next five years. for the oil and gas sector in 2014, the factors that will spur spending include: (i) the award of new risk-sharing contracts; (ii) more enhanced oil recovery projects; (iii) contracts for drilling rigs to local contractors; and (iv) the rm60 billion refinery and petrochemical integrated development (rapid) petrochemical complex in pengerang, johor. there had recently been reports that the rapid project may not meet its final investment decision deadline of march 2014, although the delay is due more to resettlement issues rather than financial viability. reflecting muhibbahs increasing global status and its ability to clinch major overseas projects, only 28% of its order book is currently for malaysian projects. this buffers the company against a slowdown in domestic construction activities where competition and margins have been tight. the group hopes its two projects in the middle east  the earlier completed yemen lng project and the ongoing doha international airport catering facility  will open the doors to more projects in the region. qatar in particular, is investing heavily in infrastructure. on the aph front, there have been no new developments. any move to revive or restructure the project will benefit muhibbah in the future in terms of write-backs, as some rm240 million in full provisions were already made in 2012. muhibbahs cambodian airport operations offer attractive exposure to cambodias economy, with gross domestic product growth of 7.2% to 7.5% per year until 2015, supported by the strong tourism and textile industries. the airport operations are 30% owned through a joint venture with the french vinci group, and the concessions last until 2040. in 2013, the phnom penh and siem reap airports combined registered 18% growth in total passenger arrivals to 5.07 million, following an already strong 17% growth in arrivals to 4.3 million in 2012. the phnom penh airport saw a 15% growth in arrivals to 2.39 million while the siem reap airports arrivals rose 20% to 2.66 million. future growth will come from expansion of the two airports, as well as increased flights at the new third airport concession in sihanoukville, the gateway to southern cambodias beaches and islands, textile manufacturing base and newly discovered o&g deposits. note: this report is brought to you by asia analytica sdn bhd, a licensed investment

multi-national china steel corporation (csc group) is keen to invest in pellet manufacturing and wastewater management, as well as in a combined heat and power (chp) plant and the lahad datu palm oil industrial cluster (poic lahad datu). kaohsiung-based csc group (utilities) general manager, jack chen jung kuei, said the group sees investment opportunities in sabah. \"the key is the supply security of the raw materials (biomass), and we think that the biomass joint-venture (jv) cluster model, will ensure us supply security,\" he said in a meeting with poic sabah sdn bhd officials. scheduled to launch in may, the biomass jv cluster involves biomass-owning palm oil mill operators coming together in a company, to pledge to supply a fixed amount of biomass. the aggregation of biomass will attract investors in downstream utilisation of the materials. the cluster model is devised by a tripartite collaboration among the department of industrial development & research, agensi inovasi malaysia and poic sabah sdn bhd. chen said, the diversified csc group has the know-how to make the poic lahad datu, a globally-attractive industrial park. \"i'm impressed with poic lahad datu, and i think, if it has centralised steam, power supply system and wastewater management services, it will attract even more investors,\" he said. chen, who was leading a seven-man delegation on a three-day visit to sabah, said the long-term viability of producing energy from oil palm biomass, in the case of lahad datu, can be best served by having natural gas as an additional feedstock. the visit was aimed at exploring opportunities in renewable energy, as part of the companys corporate responsibility pledge to reduce its carbon footprint, by among others, producing fuel, pellet stock and bio-coal from biomass. biomass supply and availability can be volatile, so having natural gas as an alternative fuel stock, is reassuring, he said in reference to the proposal by national petroleum company, petronas, to land natural gas in lahad datu, by building a re-gasification plant at poic lahad datu. as wastewater management and supplies of industrial gas, power and steam, would always be in demand in an industrial park like poic lahad datu, chen said that he would propose to his company, the incorporation of these elements, in the same business package with pellet-making. on treatment of palm oil mill effluent (pome) at the 124 palm oil mills in sabah, chen said that he would suggest to the csc group, to explore opportunities in introducing technologies, to help the mills meet discharge standards. while existing mills are given until 2020, to install a pome-trapping system, the system has been mandatory for all new mills, since january this year. \"the steel manufacturing business has a lot of expertise in treating and recycling wastewater, to an acceptable biochemical oxygen demand standard,\" he said. chens delegation visited poic lahad datu and several palm oil mills in felda sahabat and sawit kinabalu, and was accompanied by cheong siew hoong, the sabah director of the malaysian investment development authority (mida). csc group, formed in 1971, has its core business in steel making, and is ranked as one of the top 30 steelmakers in the world. it has businesses in engineering, trading, logistics, shipping and industrial materials, with mills

respective head of research, who were each invited to submit five best calls, plus an additional nomination for best discovery. we cannot feature all of them here, due to the lack of space. we chose to acknowledge two winners from year 2012, as they continued to be right in 2013 and the relative quantum of stock gains, warranted the acknowledgement. for our part, the edge best call awards is meant to recognise good fundamental analysis, in the hope of spurring continued excellence and the unearthing of new gems. it is not meant to be a measure of performance or a determinant of ones bonus, and it is certainly not meant to be a glory box.  humility is one trait that winners should never forget. and like any true gem, their worth will ultimately be acknowledged, given time.  here are year 2013s winners, in no particular order. congratulations again to the winners. to the gems who did not make the cut in year 2013, keep up the good work and all the best for year 2014. rhb

entry price into prestariang bhd, that was 44% lower than its 90 sen initial public offering (ipo) price. in fact, when he said that it was time to buy on sept 29, 2011, prestariang was near its all-time low of 49 sen. highlighting its 50% payout policy, he said that dividend yields were at least 10%. the stock rocketed 172%, within 10 months. on jan 8, 2013, when prices were at rm1.16, kong told clients that prestariang should be worth a buck more. those who followed, would have more-than-doubled their money, as the stock gained as much as 152% to rm2.85 apiece, on dec 13. at the time of writing, there was still another 18% upside potential to his rm3.37 price target, with 4.2% potential yield, going by his fy2014 dividend forecast of 12 sen apiece. we anticipate a slew of oil and gas contracts, to catalyse a re-rating of its shares, he wrote of the company that provides it-related training and certification.  kongs price target is the highest among three analysts tracking the stock, bloomberg data shows. the most conservative is public investment bank researchs chong hoe leong, who receives special mention, because those that bought prestariang when he initiated coverage with a buy in mid-august 2012, would have seen gains of as much as 149% at its peak. chong has since cut prestariang to neutral, with a price target at rm2.47. only time will tell as to who will be proved right. maybank investment bank research analyst ong chee tings call on genting plantations bhd plantation stocks saw lacklustre trading for most of 2013, as high crude palm oil inventory levels weighed on prices. ong chee ting, however, breathed new life into genting plantations bhd, by recasting the stock as an iskandar development play. in a march 6, 2013 note, he told clients that genting plantations rm6.4 billion market capitalisation, has merely priced in its growing palm oil assets. what investors overlooked is genting plantations some 6,600 acres of prime landbank, worth rm4 billion, in iskandar and sepang, he said, telling clients that at rm8.50 levels, they were getting the iskandar landbank for free.  raising his recommendation to a buy and price target from rm8 to rm10.30, he said that there was already a 20% discount to the rm13 apiece that he had calculated the assets to be worth.  genting plantations rose as much as 33.6% to rm11.53 apiece on nov 18, 2013, gaining as much as rm2.2 billion in market cap, before the latest round of property cooling measures doused investor confidence.  at the time of writing, genting plantations market cap was at rm8.3 billion, with its share price closing at rm10.94 on dec 16, 2013. when ong cut his call to hold on nov 19, with a rm10.10 target price, the stock was going for rm11.20 apiece. now, he has a rm10.90

going into 2014? on nov 12, 2013, she upgraded her recommendation to a buy. her target price was raised from rm5.97 to rm6.47 apiece, even as she lifted the price-earnings ratio (per) to 10 times, from 8 times, after taking into consideration daibochi plastic and packaging industry bhds 16.2 times, and tomypak holdings bhds 10 times per.  the upgrade also came as scientex proposed to buy food packaging-maker, seacera polyfilms sdn bhd, for rm40 million  a deal she expects to only lift fy2014 earnings by 1.1%, but could raise gearing to 0.31 times. her price target is the most bullish among four analysts polled on bloomberg, all of whom were calling a buy. hwangdbs vickers research analysts kevin wong and chong tjen-san on muhibbah engineering (m) bhd muhibbah engineering (m) bhd was first featured in the edge best call awards in 2006, as the years best discovery, by asia analytica sdn bhds kevin khoo, who was the first to issue an extensive report in september 2005. muhibbah, which started 2006 near 20 sen levels, reached rm3.50 levels by july 2007. by october 2008, however, the stock had fallen to 60 sen levels and largely hovered around the rm1 levels, until early 2013. on march 27, 2013, hwangdbs analysts kevin wong and chong tjen-san, reintroduced the niche marine, and oil and gas contractor  which also makes cranes and ships, as well as takes on civil engineering jobs  to investors.  with an increasingly-crowded civil infrastructure space, we think that this spread of business differentiates muhibbah from the average contractor, they said, when initiating coverage with a rm2.15 target price. at the time, the company  which stood to benefit from a new wave of petronas offshore service vessel contracts  was also among those shortlisted for myanmars mandalay international airport concession. from rm1.18 apiece, muhibbah jumped 130% to reach rm2.72, on july 27, 2013. even at rm2.33 on dec 16, 2013, the stock has appreciated 97%, since coverage was initiated. although this is smaller than its 182% gain year-to-date, it is still a great comeback story. now, the analysts value muhibbah at rm3.10 apiece. will they continue to be right?bimb research

2013, as investors began looking for value in the small and mid-cap space. she was also not the most bullish, among analysts polled on bloomberg. however, hers was the best among submissions received for consideration, when it came to recommendations in the alternative real estate developer space. investors who paid attention when law said butterworth-based tambun indah should be worth as much as 34% more, based on what its assets and landbank were worth, stood to benefit as the stock rose 70%, from 89 sen on april 2, 2013, to as high as rm1.51 on aug 19. she had a price target of rm1.70 at the time of writing, implying just over 20% upside, for the company that she reckons will see spillover benefits from the investments going into penang, and improved accessibility via the penang second link. bimb securities research analyst chiong tong chai and hong leong investment bank analyst low yee huaps calls on uzma bhd uzma bhd may not be a big name among oil and gas counters, but with its stock up over 200% in year 2013, it is one of those counters that with hindsight, many would kick themselves for not buying. part of the gains was spurred by investors gravitation towards the esoteric oil and gas business in 2013. it is due to the quantum of the gains that bimb securities researchs chiong tong chai and hong leong investment banks (hlib) low yee huap, both merit notable mentions. bimb, which started covering uzma in 2011, has the stock as its top pick in year 2013.  hlib too, began covering the company, ahead of its rally in 2013. as the edge best call awards usually go to new calls made during the year, both recommendations would not normally have made the list, as they are not entirely new. the decision to make an exception, took into consideration that some calls will take time to be proved right, and investors who took action should be laughing all the way to the bank. petroliam nasional bhds strategy to enhance oil recovery on existing and new oilfields augurs well for uzma, which is also eyeing risk-sharing contracts (rsc) for marginal oilfield developments.  chiong is now neutral on uzma, with a rm5.05 price target, but foresees the successful bagging of an rsc, bringing the company better fortunes. low, on the other hand, still has a buy call and rm5.20 target price. time will tell, who has the better call. cimb research analyst norziana mohd inon and kaf-seagroatt & campbell securities analyst dharmini thuraisingams calls on alam maritim resources bhd alam maritim resources bhd is not done yet, with its splashy comeback this year  thats what cimb researchs norziana mohd inon told clients in march 2013, after the stock leapt from 50 sen in october 2012, to around 85 sen. from there, the stock nearly doubled, in less than four months, to as high as rm1.67 in july 2013. it was still up 122% at its rm1.52 close, on dec 16, 2013. norziana, who started coverage on alam maritim in march 2008, continues to be bullish on the company, due to its ballooning order book and the anticipation of improvements in utilisation and charter rates, amid a significant pick-up in offshore drilling activities. her target price was rm1.90, at the time of writing. another long-time believer of alam maritim is kaf-seagroatt & campbell securities dharmini thuraisingam, who also saw the recovery on charter rates for offshore vessels. in january 2013, she told clients that the earlier spike in share price was just the beginning of a larger structural re-rating of the stock. she has a target price of rm1.80. due to the strong gains seen at alam maritim in 2013, both analysts earn notable mentions for their continued conviction that proved propitious for clients, although their calls have been maintained for years. cimb research analyst nigel foos call on my eg services bhd if my eg services bhds shares ran harder in 2012, cimb researchs nigel foo might have earned the best discovery award in 2012. the delayed response by the market notwithstanding, investors who picked up my eg shares at 73 sen levels, when foo started coverage with a buy on aug 6, 2012, would have more-than-tripled their investments in just 16 months. my egs lowest point in 2013, was 74 sen on feb 6, during which, foo told clients that the shares were worth rm1.34 apiece. those who bought back the shares would have been sitting on 260% of gains, as they touched rm2.67 apiece on nov 27. total returns were still 249%, if measured between the initiation on aug 6, 2012, and dec 16s rm2.54 close. in his initiation note, foo said that my eg could even thrive in recessions, as consumers are encouraged to use its cheaper and more convenient services. it also enjoys some recurring income, he said in a note, on sept 19, 2013, which highlighted potential income stream from the custom service tax monitoring system and road safety diagnostic services, that had not been pencilled into its forecasts. foo has since cut my eg to hold on dec 12, 2013, with there being only 6.1% upside potential to his rm2.78 target price, from its rm2.62 close that day. thats conservative relative to macquarie research, which became the second house to start coverage on my eg, on aug 15, 2013. the latter still says buy, with a rm3 target price. amresearch analyst thomas soons call on kkb engineering bhd when amresearchs thomas soon initiated coverage on kkb engineering bhd with a buy on sept 3, 2012, the stock was hovering near a two-year low of rm1.45. the counter hardly moved, but eight months later, soon saw reason to raise his price target, from rm1.80 to rm1.91 apiece, on april 19, 2013. citing information from kkbs 2012 annual report, soon flagged kkb chairman datuk kho kak bengs statement, that the group stands ready to expand further into fabrication, for the oil and gas sector, in the near future, having more-than-tripled its yard capacity, to 50,000 tonnes in 2012.  its prospects have also brightened considerably, since its 43%-owned associate oceanmight sdn bhd secured a three-year petronas approved supplier licence, which allows it to tender for offshore facility fabrication jobs. among the jobs that it has since bagged, include a rm17.1 million fabrication job for petronas proposed lng train 9 project in bintulu, sarawak. incidentally, kkb was also hovering at rm1.45 levels, on april 19, 2013. investors who bought on soons cue, would have seen 96% gains in about six months, as the stock reached as high as rm2.84 on oct 31, 2013  exceeding his target price of rm2.50, at the time. he has since downgraded his recommendation to hold, with a target price of rm2.71  a level the stock hit on dec 16. the price target had worked in a 5% discount to his rm2.85 sum-of-parts valuation of the company, which is 20% owned by cahya mata sarawak bhd. alliance research analyst ian wans call on carlsberg brewery malaysia bhd if alliance researchs ian wan had a crystal ball, he might have chosen to tell clients to buy a little more carlsberg brewery malaysia bhd shares at rm12 levels, given that the stock did appreciate another 42%, to reach a peak of rm17.06 on may 31, 2013. what impressed the judges, that they gave him a coveted spot in 2013, however, was how he rightly told clients to buy the stock, up to about the rm12 levels, and then correctly cut his recommendation to sell, on may 30, 2013  just before carlsberg peaked and began sliding. this was after the brewerys 1qfy2013 results came in below expectations, making up only 23.3% of alliance researchs full-year forecast. when the stock had shed some 29% to reach the rm12 levels again, wan raised his call to neutral on nov 19, 2013, despite the companys 3qfy2013 results, coming in below expectations yet again. he justified that the overall downside is limited, after the share price slid 24%, since his sell call on may 30. we believe, at its current valuation, market has largely priced in the challenging outlook. as such, we upgrade the stock from sell to neutral, he said in the report, while revising the target price to rm11.24, which implies 18.9 times earnings and a 5.3% yield for fy2014. will his call continue to prove prescient? dbs vickers research analyst quah he weis call on dayang enterprise holdings bhd dbs vickers researchs quah he wei, once wrote in his note, that dayang enterprise holdings bhd had [hit] a jackpot! investors who paid attention when he recommended that they buy dayang, as far back as july 2011, when the stock was going for rm1.80 apiece, would have hit a small jackpot of their own, as the stock price rallied in 2013. if measured from a low of rm2.302 in late-february 2013, dayangs shares had increased 147%, as it hit a 52-week high of rm5.69, on dec 13, 2013. on hindsight, the call would have been near perfect, had he only started coverage about a year earlier, when the stock was going for rm1.77. seven out of eight analysts polled on bloomberg, still have a buy on dayang, according to bloomberg data, at the time of writing. quahs rm5.90 target price is the most conservative, being rm1.08 or 15.5% below the most-bullish target price of rm6.98 apiece. at dec 16s rm5.59 close, quahs price target implied only 5.5% upside potential. regardless of whether a downgrade is in store, or if he will turn out to be overly conservative, he has earned a spot for the best recommendation, among the submissions received for consideration. that, in itself, warrants a pat on the back. this story first appeared in the edge weekly edition of

was higher other income and share of profit from associate and joint ventures. the firm also said its larger profit was due to lower tax expense resulting from a change in deferred tax estimates. this came on the back of a lower future statutory tax rate. petgas said its revenue increase was largely due to regasification revenue. this followed commencement of the lng regasification terminal operations in the second quarter last year and higher gas transportation revenue. the firm, however, said the increase was partially offset by lower utilities revenue on the back of lower offtake by customers. for the full-year period, net profit earned was rm2.1 billion, up from rm1.4 billion in the previous corresponding period, while revenue raked in was rm3.9 billion from rm3.6 billion a year ago. petgas said the cumulative profit was mainly due to contribution from its regasification segment from the second quarter last year. but it was partially offset by gain from partial disposal of shareholding in gas malaysia bhd in the previous year. furthermore the firm said the higher profit was due to recognition of deferred tax assets arising from investment tax allowance granted for the lng regasification terminal amounting to rm626.4 million. petgas said the improved cumulative revenue was due to similar reasons given for the fourth quarter. looking ahead, the groups earnings are expected to remain stable as the structure of the new gas processing and transmission agreements are expected to be not significantly different from the existing structure, said petgas.the new

lower fourth quarter net profit of rm151.31 million, compared to rm176.50 million netted in similar quarter a year ago. but revenue for the fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2013, rose to rm8.39 billion from rm7.69 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012, according to the companys filing with bursa malaysia. the huge trading arm of national oil company petronas declared an interim dividend of 17.5 sen. reviewing the fourth quarter results, the company said the increase of rm698.0 million in revenue was due to an increase in average selling price by 6.1% and increase in sales volume by 2.8%. but higher operating expenditure had depressed profits. for the full year of 2013, total profits came to rm811.75 million, compared to rm836.84 million in 2012 while revenue totalled rm32.34 billion, up from rm29.51 billion. looking ahead, petronas dagangans retail segment was expected to maintain its margin contribution, mainly from the sales of subsidised petroleum products. its commercial segment was also expected to maintain its performance. digi.com bhd, rose 17 sen or 3.6% to rm4.85, after announcing a spectacular set of results today. digi.com bhd reported a 123% jump in fourth quarter net

rm245.52 million. revenue rose to rm1.73 billion from rm1.63 billion. its full-year net profit rose to rm1.71 billion from rm1.21 billion a year earlier. revenue was higher at rm6.73 billion versus rm6.36 billion. digi plans to reward shareholders with a tax-free dividend of seven sen a share for 4qfy13. this brings full-year dividends to 21.3 sen per share. looking ahead, digi said it expected to see growth, expansion to moderate due to market competition and rising cost. during fy14, digi expects revenue to grow between 4% and 6%. sarawaks politically-linked counters, such as cmsb and

rm2.80 per share, which implied a total capitalisation of rm6.05 billion. according to umw-og president rohaizad darus, the incoming deliveries of new jack-up (ju) drilling rigs will boost the groups earnings substantially over the next two years. drilling services contributed 94% to its total revenue for the first nine months of last year (9m2013). its simple mathematics. our four operational rigs currently generate a certain amount of revenue. if we add another one, our bottom line will increase by 25%, he says during a media briefing last thursday. rohaizad was referring to naga 5, the

by the new rig. apart from its ju fleet, the group is also the sole malaysian operator of hydraulic workover units (hwus), with four currently being deployed in three countries on short- and long-term tenures. coupled with a rm1 billion war chest from its ipo proceeds after deducting last years expenses, rohaizad is confident that the group can leverage on its working relationship with petroliam nasional bhd and other oil majors to secure new contracts for its ju rigs and hwus. we believe we are able to finance a significant number of new rigs and also secure new contracts due to the increasing regional demand. despite its recent share price gains, there are contrasting valuations on the company by research houses. according to bloomberg data, the consensus analyst view is mostly bearish with 9 out of 13 research houses issuing a neutral or sell rating on umw-og. the most bullish are maybank ib research and cimb research, which set a target price of rm4.80 and rm4.63

another two ju rigs  naga 6 and naga 7  by 2015 warrants a premium valuation on the stock. at rm4.80 per share, the research firm has pegged umw-ogs shares at 23 times projected earnings for fy2015. in its calculations, maybank ib projected that umw-ogs core net profit and core earnings per share will triple within two years after taking into account the additional revenue boost from the three upcoming ju rigs. the market now demands new, premium jus, favoured for their superior security, cost and operating features. more importantly, umw-og has the balance sheet strength to expand its ju fleet size beyond the projected five units, it says. however, it is worth noting that new contracts are the lifeblood of oil and gas companies. umw-ogs contract backlog stands at rm1.45 billion, a small figure compared with the order books of other big caps such as sapurakencana petroleum bhd (rm28 billion) and bumi armada bhd (rm10.8 billion), says alliance research, which has a sell call on

outlook for umw-og is promising, especially if the group adds on new rigs, we view that valuations have run too far ahead of peers at this juncture, it says. at the moment, a huge chunk of umw-ogs revenue comes from contracts awarded by petronas carigali sdn bhd (pcsb), with three out of four rigs deployed for the upstream players needs. apart from pcsb, umw-ogs client base for the ju rigs

contracts in southeast asia this year. in malaysia, there are currently 18 jus, of which 16 are foreign owned. in line with the growing demand, daily charter rates for jus have accordingly risen over the past four years. according to maybank ib, average day rates are now holding steadily at us$150,000 and should rise to between us$160,000 and us$170,000 levels due to the favourable oil price

line with our expectations of higher utilisation rates stemming from a cyclical upturn in the osv market based on an increase in offshore o&g work which in turn flows from petronas 5 year rm300

65% of our fy13 estimates.  the market is still dogged by oversupply issues, particularly chinas crude steel. the imbalance will be difficult to address, if chinas steel output remains high. it was reported that steel supply reached 65.4 million tonnes, up 11% y-o-y in september, 2013.  we anticipate the situation to remain challenging in the fourth quarter of 2013. that said, we are lowering our earnings forecasts by 27.5% and 26.7%, for fy13 and fy14 respectively. we are also reducing our price-to-book multiple on csc steel shares to 0.61 times, from 0.83 times, which is -1.5 standard deviations below the five-year historical average. downgrade to neutral, from trading buy.sapurakencana petroleum bhdtarget price: rm4.62 strong buy alliance research (nov 11): despite concern over increased competition for the pan malaysian installation contract, sapurakencana petroleum (sakp) has reportedly emerged as a front runner for the deepwater and heavy-lift packages.  the other contender for these packages is singapores swiber offshore. however, sakp is said to have the edge over swiber, given petronas local preference policy. these contracts have already been factored into our estimates, as sakp has been the key contractor for malaysian installation work since 2008. based on the rates indicated by petronas, we estimate packages c, d and e can be worth rm3 billion to rm3.5 billion, assuming a three-year term. this is less than sakps previous contract sum of rm4.5 billion, for four packages awarded in 2008.  despite the smaller contract value, we expect margins to be better this time around, as the groups vessels working on the job will be wholly-owned. we maintain our strong buy call on sakp, with a view to raise earnings estimates. scientex bhdtarget price: rm6.28 outperform kenanga research (nov 12): on nov 11, 2013, scientex announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire the entire stake in seacera polyfilms sdn bhd  a manufacturer of biaxially-oriented polypropylene (bopp) films, which are used for packaging.  we are positive about the proposed acquisition, as it will enable scientex to venture into an essential component of the consumer packaging product industry, and to gain a larger share of the market.  based on the announcement, seacera polyfilms recorded a revenue of rm44.5 million and a net profit of rm500,000, for the year ended dec 31, 2012.  however, we understand that the low net profit was due to management fees owed to seacera group, which will be reversed under the share sale agreement. on this basis, seacera polyfilms net profit is actually rm2.8 million, implying a per of 14.3 times. we remain positive about scientexs ongoing expansion plans and earnings potential.  maintain target price of rm6.28, based on the blended sop valuation.ytl power international bhdtarget price: rm2.55 outperform cimb research (nov 11): we maintain our outperform call on ytl power, with an unchanged sop-based target price of rm2.55. we believe, the news that ytl power submitted the lowest bid for project 3b, will put the company on investors radar again.  the rerating catalyst will be the announcement of ytl power, securing the contract for project 3b, which is expected to be known by early 2014. assuming ytl power wins the bid, this will provide the group with consistent cash flows from 2018 onwards, and will supplement its current stable businesses. although the dividends can be called into question, given the high capex required for the project, we believe ytl power can ring-fence the construction cost, because of the strong and stable cash flow of the plant. stronger cash flows from the project, will likely translate into bigger dividends in the long term. furthermore, the return of ytl power to the independent power producer scene, implies that there may be more major contracts ahead.guinness anchor bhdtarget price: rm17.50 neutral cimb research (nov 10): guinness anchor bhd (gab) saw its 1qfy14 net profit fall 13% y-o-y, to rm49.6 million. the poor result was due to the drag from the planned reduction in distributor stocks, and weaker consumer spending in anticipation of subsidy cuts and the goods and services tax under budget 2014.  we believe it was also due to less aggressive advertising and promotion (a&p) activities in 1qfy14, as well as pre-budget stockpiling by retailers. we cut our fy14-16 net profit forecasts by 4% to 8%, after lowering our sales expectations by 7%. our dividend discount model-based target price, is reduced correspondingly. although gabs valuation is unattractive, its 4% to 4.5% dividend yield will lend support to its share price.  we think competition will remain intense going forward, as carlsberg has also been investing heavily in a&p, in the past few months. to remain competitive, gab will continue to invest in brand line extension. it will launch several new brands in fy14, especially in the super premium and premium beer categories. petronas chemicals bhdtarget price: rm6.15 hold hwangdbs vickers research (nov 11): following petronas chemicals 3qfy13 results conference call, we understand that the groups olefins and derivatives segment recorded lower plant utilisation of 77.6%, mainly due to heavier-than-usual maintenance at its main cracker and downstream-related facilities. similarly, the fertiliser and methanol segments plant utilisation rate dropped to 62.3%, from 80.3% in 2q13, as a result of unplanned shutdown at its methanol plant, stemming from technical issues related to gas quality and equipment concerns. these issues have since been addressed. the methanol plant will likely remain idle until the end of year 2013, coinciding with the upstream shutdown. to date, project samur has incurred 45% of its capital expenditure, and is on track for commissioning in 2015. the final investment decision for the basf aroma complex, is expected by year-end. we expect the company to improve its performance come 2014. datasonic group bhdtarget price: rm10.51 buy rhb research (nov 12): datasonic received an extension of contract worth rm182.8 million, to supply 10 million raw mykads to be delivered in december 2013, on top of the rm73.1 million contract to supply four million new mykads awarded by the national registration department in 2011.  sources indicate that the government is looking to place orders for 10 million more new cards worth rm180 million to rm190 million, in 1qfy14, to curb identity fraud-related crimes. in 2012, datasonic won a rm284.7 million contract to supply photo pages for 10 million passports, over five years. it started supplying the sheets in 3qfy13, and management indicated an annual run rate of 2.4 million to 2.5 million copies.  we forecast that datasonic will more than double its net profit to rm76.7 million, by fy13. we foresee the groups bottom line breaching the rm100 million threshold in fy15, after taking into account the potential replenishment of 10 million new mykads, and likely margins enhancement, after the completion of its new mykad assembly plant by end-fy13.ammb holdings bhdtarget price: rm7.89 neutral alliance research (nov 12): local dailies reported that amfraser securities pte ltd, a wholly-owned brokerage unit of ammb, is believed to have financial exposure of close to s$150 million (rm384.6 million), related to the recent share price collapse of blumont group ltd, liongold corp ltd and asiasons capital ltd, listed on the singapore exchange.  we have not adjusted our earnings estimates, in view of the uncertainties and complexity of the issue. besides that, it remains to be seen how much of such financial exposure is being collateralised. on a positive note, our recent correspondence with the management of ammb, indicated that the incident does not have a significant impact on the groups fy14 earnings.  we are maintaining our neutral call for the group, with an unchanged target price of rm7.89. our target price implied a 1.7 times 2014 price-to-book ratio and 15% return on equity, based on our gordon growth valuation model. westports holdings bhd target price: rm2.70 buy  maybank investment (nov 12): we expect 4qfy13 earnings to be boosted by the seasonally stronger volume from the christmas-related trade and a substantially lower effective tax rate, as the group starts to enjoy tax holiday for the new wharf under container terminal 7. we note that 4qfy12 net profit accounted for 38% of westports full-year fy12 earnings. we recently met up with cma cgm  westports biggest client, to assess the implications of the proposed p3 alliance on westports. the key takeaways are: (i) net volume loss at westports could be only 175,000 teus per annum or 2% of westports total volume, as cma cgm introduces new non-p3 services from 1hfy14 onwards; and (ii) cma cgm will remain committed to hubbing at westports. taking into consideration the p3-related volume loss and growth from the non-p3 business, we project a container throughput growth of 7% (fy13), 6% (fy14) and 8% (fy15). given its dividend payout policy of 75%, we project a net dividend yield of 4.1% for fy14.mah sing group bhd fair value: rm3.80 buy  amresearch (nov 11): we consider the nine months results to be in line, constituting 75% of our full-year estimates and 73% of consensus.  mah sings unbilled sales stood at a sturdy rm4.2 billion (2.7 times fy12 property revenue). the group is on track to achieve its fy13f new sales target of rm3 billion, having secured close to rm2.3 billion for 9mfy13. key projects are [emailprotected], m residence 1 & 2, m city, as well as mah sing i-parc.  we expect mah sing to potentially lock in around rm718 million for the pre-selected units in dsara sentral and savannas initial launches. the strong take-up rates achieved for both projects, come without developer interest bearing scheme incentives. mah sings future launches will focus on larger township projects offering affordable products, notably landed residential units or apartments with initial price points of below rm500,000.  nestle (m) bhdtarget price: rm72.80 market outperform kenanga research (nov 12): nescafe has a strong market share of more than 70% in the local market, where consumption of coffee is still considered at the lower-end of 120 cups per capita.  a survey also showed that coffee contributed only 9% to the overall beverage market, hinting at more room for growth. ytd, nescafes volume growth outperformed that of the overall coffee market.  we continue to see vast growth opportunities, driven by nestles product innovation, marketing investments and capacity expansion. including the construction of a new plant, nestle management has guided a capex of rm250 million for fy13e. we estimate net gearing for fy13e will be reduced slightly, from 0.38 times to 0.32 times. construction of the new plant is on schedule and will commence operations in the middle of 2014. due to the minor changes in the fixed assets, as a result of the capex adjustment, our net profit forecast is edged slightly higher by 0.1% to 0.2%, for fy13e and fy14e, from rm544.3 million-rm588.6 million to rm545.1 million-rm589.5 million.boustead heavyindustries corp bhdfair value: rm3.80 buy amresearch (nov 12): bhics 51%-owned contraves advanced devices sdn bhd (cad) has been awarded a contract by its 21%-owned boustead naval shipyard sdn bhd (bns), to supply the torpedo launching system for the second-generation littoral combat ship (lcs) programme. currently, cad has already secured rm2.5 billion in subcontract works from bns. this represents 30% of the confirmed rm9 billion lcs contract value, that was awarded to bns. including the torpedo launching system, we believe that the total value of cads subcontracts could reach rm3 billion.  we expect the earnings contribution from these lcs subcontract works to be progressively recognised throughout the 10-year delivery period. hence, we maintain bhics fy13f to fy15f earnings, on expectations of a significant y-o-y surge in 4qfy13 earnings, as bns has yet to recognise progress billings from the lcs contract to date.  the stock currently trades at an attractive fy14f per of only six times, 70% below singapore technologies engineering ltds current valuation. this story first appeared in the edge weekly edition of
