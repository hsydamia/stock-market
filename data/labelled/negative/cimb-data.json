rm1.69: we are optimistic about ytl corp bhds chances to bid for the kuala lumpur-singapore high-speed rails (hsr) operating company (opco) tender. opco is one of the three main components of the kuala lumpur-singapore hsrs structure  project delivery partner (pdp) and assets company (assetsco) being the other two. the opco tender, once it is called, would be more relevant to ytl corp, in our view, given its experience in the 45%-owned express rail link sdn bhd (erl)  the sole domestic hsr service concession built at only rm35 million per km  arguably the lowest cost in the region. we do not expect the opco tender to require a significant amount of capital expenditure compared to the assetsco, as a typical rail operating and maintenance model does not purchase the rolling stock and would mainly generate fare and non-fare revenues once the hsr is in operations. as such, the opco would therefore be the most relevant tender for ytl corps erl, given erls 14-year track record in operating its 57km hsr service (both direct airport express and transit service). while erls chief executive officer has highlighted in an interview with nikkei markets that the company will be tendering for the kuala lumpur-singapore hsrs opco, we also gather that at the group level, ytl corp, via its joint venture (jv) that is vying for a substantial package of the rm8.9 billion gemas-johor baru rail double-tracking project, would also be keen to bid for the pdp domestic portion of the kuala lumpur-singapore hsr civil work. alternatively, securing the kuala lumpur-singapore hsr civil work portion is also a possibility given ytl corps rm2.4 billion erl construction track record. ytl corp has now emerged as one of the five known jv/consortiums that are bidding for the pdp, opco, and assetsco tenders for the kuala lumpur-singapore hsr project. while it remains to be seen if ytl corp or 45%-owned erl would be looking to rake in foreign partners for the kuala lumpur-singapore hsr tenders, we believe the group would be leveraging its existing domestic partnerships. erl is currently 45% owned by ytl corp, 36% by lembaga tabung haji, 10% by sipp rail sdn bhd, and 9% by trisilco equity. even excluding kuala lumpur-singapore hsr, the group is targeting a significant jump in outstanding order book of up to rm12 billion (rm400 million currently). while the press recently reported that the group had secured the rm8.9 billion gemas-johor baru rail project contract (via a jv with sipp rail), the group has yet to make an official announcement, which we suspect, is pending the finalisation of the details of the contract. we trim financial year 2018 (fy18)-fy20 earnings per share forecast due to housekeeping. however, we raise our revalued net asset

financial year ended dec 31, 2017 (fy2017), as well as fy2018. the flexible packaging material manufacturers optimism hinges on rising contribution from its operations in myanmar and its new contracts elsewhere, such as indonesia and down under, says its managing director thomas lim soo koon. this was despite the groups rather flat earnings in the cumulative nine months ended sept 30, 2017 (9mfy2017). net profit dropped 3% to rm18.03 million from rm18.59 million in 9mfy2016 while revenue came in at rm282.99 million, marginally higher than rm280.8 million a year ago. nevertheless, net profit leapt 20.2% to rm7.22 million in the third quarter ended sept 30 from rm6 million a year ago. revenue grew 8.5% to rm102.03 million from rm94.07 million in a year ago. the group declared an interim dividend of 1.15 sen per share for the financial year, which amounted to rm3.8 million and payable on dec 28. cimb investment bank bhd analyst nigel foo forecasts daibochis revenue to be about rm500 million to rm510 million in fy2018 and rm570 million in fy2019. he expects net profit to reach rm37.88 million, or 11 sen per share, in fy2018 and rm41.5 million, or 12 sen per share, in fy2019.  myanmar joint venture a driver the companys joint venture, daibochi packaging (myanmar) co ltd (dp myanmar), is currently an earnings growth catalyst. fantastic growth is expected from there, lim tells the edge. two months ago, dp myanmars plant obtained quality and food safety management certification, which will allow the company to secure multinational corporation (mnc) clientele in the food and beverage (f&b) sector. dp myanmar, in which daibochi has a 60% stake, made a maiden contribution  rm6.5 million in revenue and rm1.8 million in pre-tax profit  in 3qfy2017. myanmar smart pack industrial co ltd holds the remaining 40%. dp myanmar, says lim, is expected to achieve annual revenue of rm100 million next year (fy2019). under the jv agreement, dp myanmar will pay at least 50% of its earnings to investors in fy2019. in fact, he notes, daibochis board is looking to declare dividends from dp myanmar in fy2018. the board is quite keen on paying out dividends earlier than under the jv agreement, but we havent worked out the numbers. lim points out that as the plant in myanmar is highly cost efficient, daibochi is looking at exporting its production to malaysia as well as thailand and the philippines. in malaysia, the cost base is high and we cannot get the margins were looking for. with the growing demand, the company intends to double the size of the myanmar plant to 120,000 sq ft. we have presented a broad masterplan and also our layout. our board likes the masterplan and we have engaged architects and secured contractors. we will build the plant in 2019, explains lim. the plant is rather small with a production floor space of 36,000 sq ft compared with daibochis two factories at its melaka plant that have a combined 520,000 sq ft, according to cimb. the myanmar plant currently takes up 60,000 sq ft of the total 380,000 sq ft that is available.  growing and resilient demand lim points out that flexible packaging products, particularly for food, are recession proof. the impact (of an economic slowdown) on us is very minimal u2026 everybody still eats maggi mee and drinks milo. according to him, when people need to stretch every ringgit they earn during an economic downturn, they tend to buy smaller packs. smaller packages use more packaging material, says lim. in other words, an economic slowdown actually boosts the use of packaging materials. currently, it (flexible packaging) is still the most economical mode of packaging for food, compared with tins, jars, glass or boxes, says lim.  spreading its wings in asean lim says the company is focusing on growing its presence in asean as well as australia and new zealand. the company expects to secure a contract worth more than rm10 million from a major pet food manufacturer in australia in the second quarter. indonesia is another area of growth for daibochi this year. we are looking for more than rm30 million worth of contracts (from indonesia), says lim. that said, he stresses that daibochi is not turning its back on the home market although it is not expecting robust growth here. i wont say we will ignore the local market. essentially, we are in maintenance mode ... export sales are giving us the growth that were looking for. with all these contracts secured, lim says, daibochi should see the utilisation rates increasing to much healthier levels. we would want to raise our utilisation rate to 75%, says lim, adding that daibochis plant in malaysia is running at 50% to 60% while the myanmar plant is at 30% to 40%. the plant in melaka will also cater for the contracts in indonesia, australia and new zealand. we believe daibochi would be able to meet the increased demand from its anz and indonesia customers without adding capacity, foo comments in a research note last november.  earnings catching up daibochis share price has been on a steady climb since 2012, when it was at the 50 sen level. the stock closed at rm2.25 last friday, a handsome gain of more than four times in about five years. cimbs foo, however, has a reduce call on the stock, citing the expensive valuation. he has raised daibochis target price to rm2.02 from rm1.88 in view of the myanmar jvs attractive long-term growth prospects and tax-free earnings. he writes that the myanmar jv received a five-year tax exemption from the myanmar government and the company plans to start

malaysia since the start of the year has caught many off guard. the excitement is set to continue for bursa malaysia ahead of the 14th general election (ge14), with the local market showing first signs of the much-anticipated pre-election rally since jan 3. the market has been on a strong upward trend amid the recovering ringgit and stronger oil price. talk of a pre-election rally has resurfaced among investors, as well as in the media. while we see some profit-taking activities as we approach the end of our second week of trading, we believe the weakness in the market presents a good buying opportunity for investors and traders, rakuten trade sdn bhd head of research kenny yee told the edge financial daily. we think that the high spirits leading to the elections, as well as the euphoria in the stock market seen in the developed markets will fuel the momentum in the domestic stock market, he added. echoing the same sentiment, ta securities research head kaladher govindan is of the view that the strong run in the benchmark index so far this year is in line with expectations. it was within our expectations if you follow our strategy reports. we expect the fbm klci to hit 1,890 points in the first half of 2018 (1h18), especially in the first quarter before retreating in 2h18, kaladher said via email. in its annual strategy report published on dec 8 last year, ta securities wrote that expectations of a ge14 rally should propel the fbm klci higher in 1h18, premised on the assumption the elections will be held in march or april this year. however, kaladher highlighted a possible correction in the market in 1h18. a barisan nasional victory could hold up on the market momentarily, but we reckon the fbm klci could be due for a correction in 2h18 as concerns over the us monetary tightening and ringgit weakness reverberate across the market and translate into heavy foreign selling and a risk-averse strategy among investors, he added. however, kaladher noted that the downside pressure can emerge sooner in 1h18 if the current ruling coalitions power base crumbles after the elections. affin hwang asset management is also optimistic about a better year in 2018 and expects the fbm klci to see a 6% to 8% upside, tracking market earnings growth. analysts are starting the year with a projection of 9% to 10% [growth]. the expectation is that the stronger ringgit will lead to margin expansion [as opposed to contraction] for domestic-oriented companies, its senior associate director of equities cheryl pola said. the fbm klci has climbed 8.6% over the past year. however, cimb investment bank head of malaysia research ivy ng believes the market still has legs to run, maintaining an end-2018 fbm klci target of 1,880 points. the local market ended the week on a positive note last week, with the fbm klci closing 5.79 points or 0.32% higher at 1,822.67. market breadth was positive with 643 gainers versus 389 losers. taking a look at the 30 constituents of the fbm klci, the best-performing stock so far is sime darby bhd. the counter climbed 22.2% year to date (ytd) to close at rm2.70 last friday. this was followed by petronas gas bhd and ytl corp bhd, with gains of 8.7% and 8% respectively. six of the fbm klci component stocks were on a downtrend, with klccp stapled group emerging as the worst performer ytd, falling 9.1% to

direction of sime darby. despite a strong start to the year, the fbm klci is still underperforming its regional peers and developed markets. the edge financial daily has spoken to several heads of research on some of the potential stocks they see among the component stocks that could run higher on the back of the positive sentiment in the global equity market, recovering oil prices and the ringgit, as well as the boost from the upcoming ge14. 1) tenaga nasional bhd a screaming buy among analysts, tenaga nasional bhd (tnb) rose 3.4% in the first two weeks of the year. most analysts continue to favour tnb as bloomberg data shows that 20 out of 25 analysts that cover the stock have a buy call. according to rakuten trades yee, the utility companys valuation is undemanding and provides decent dividend yield. at its closing price of rm15.78 last friday, tnb is trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio (per) of 12.9 times and has a dividend yield of about 3.9%. tnb is also cimbs top three big caps for 2018 as ng sees the stock offer a resilient organic earnings growth potential. according to her, it is building four new power plants in malaysia, which could raise its generation earnings in 2017 to 2020. she also pointed out that stronger earnings driven by the new assets tnb acquired in the past year are another potential rerating catalyst. ta securities, which has a target price (tp) of rm17.38 for tnb, indicating a potential return of about 10%, has also picked the utility company as one of its top picks. ta securities analyst kylie chan sze zan said in an annual strategy report that tnb is attractive on most valuation metrics, including a 10.9 times forward per, which is one standard deviation below historical average, 7.1 times forward enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, which is an 18% discount to regional peers. based on bloombergs consensus data, the 12-month tp for tnb is at rm16.61, indicating a potential return of 5.3%. tnb was also one of the stocks that featured on the edge financial dailys top 10 picks for 2018. 2) axiata group bhd axiata group bhd is expected to perform in 2018 as the telecommunication company is expected to see an improvement in its earnings after witnessing four consecutive years of earnings contraction at its operating companies  celcom axiata bhd and indonesias pt xl axiata tbk. the turnaround appears to be expected by the market as seen by the gain of 1.1% in the first 10 trading days of 2018. this was in contrast to its share price performance in the last three years where it fell by about 14.6%. according to cimbs ng, axiatas core earnings per share is expected to rebound by a strong 29% and 50% for its forecast for financial years ending dec 31, 2018 and 2019 respectively due to much higher contributions from xl, net profit break-even for airtel bangladesh ltd by end-2018 and cessation in equity accounting for ideas losses post-merger with vodafone. rakutens yee concurred, noting that axiatas digital transformation is expected to bring an improvement to its earnings. other than that, the news flow of a potential initial public offering of its tower unit, edotco group sdn bhd, this year is also another catalyst for axiata, he said. 3) banking sector cimb, maybank affin hwang asset managements pola is of the view that banks are among those that could do well in 2018. this year has been about improvement in asset quality. in 2018, we should see stronger pre-provision growth, especially if interest rates rise, which will lead to net interest margin expansion [but to a lesser extent compared to its singapore counterparts], she said. she added that loan growth should be slightly stronger after the disappointing 2017. pola, however, noted that there is still an overhang on the sector as the impact of malaysian financial reporting standards 9 (mfrs9) has yet to be fully known but if the impact on provisions or book values is low as expected, it would clear another uncertainty that remains for the banking sector. our top picks are cimb group holdings bhd (inexpensive valuations) and malayan banking bhd (maybank) (possibility of capital management after mfrs9, better cash dividends, the possible listing of etiqa). hong leong bank bhd has impressive fundamentals but valuations are a bit stretched, she added. similar to pola, rakutens yee highlighted that both cimb and maybank could be proxy for foreign buying into the banking sector. maybank is also a defensive play with its relatively high dividend yield of over 5%, he added. ta securities also picked cimb as one of its top picks for 2018 in its annual strategy report. its analyst wong li hsia said cimb has been outpacing its peers in terms of yearly profit growth since the fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2015. she also pointed that better prospects in cimb niaga and cimb thai as one of the investment themes that will drive cimb. credit charges have eased. while we forecast the overall credit charge to remain elevated, we believe the worst  in terms of asset quality may be over, led by further recoveries in its overseas operations, wong said. cimbs share price gained 3.7% ytd to close at rm6.78 last friday, while maybanks share price edged higher by 0.5% to rm9.85. 4. petronas gas bhd the selldown at the end of last year created a value proportion for those who are interested in investing in petronas gas bhd (petgas). the share price fell by 4.8% compared with three years ago to its closing price of rm19.00 last friday. petgas share price fell to its low of rm15.88 in november last year compared with its three-year peak of rm22.02 in october 2015. yee believes that the selldown was overdone and was mainly due to third-party access framework concern. while the market has recovered by 19.6% from its low since then, petgas is still trading at about 4.9% below its three-year average price of rm19.93.\n"}, "6": {"date_posted": "12/1/2018", "title": "klci to trend sideways, immediate support at 1,813; oil and gas stocks seen in focus ", "article": " kuala lumpur (jan 12): the fbm klci is

edition thursday said that dampened by the down close in the preceding day, the fbm klci had on jan 11 dipped below 1,813 to an intraday low of 1,812.78 as market participants continued to play on the selling side in anticipation of a lower market. it said under the persistent selling interest, the benchmark index was in the red throughout most of the trading sessions before settling off the days low at 1,816.88 (down 6.04 points or 0.33%). in the broader market, losers outnumbered gainers with 781 stocks ending lower and 265 stocks finishing higher. that gave a market breadth of 0.34 indicating the bears were in control, it said. alliancedbs research said the market made a lower low again on jan 11 after hitting the highest high of 1,840.35 since may 5, 2015 on jan 9. market participants apparently were still unwilling to play a buying game at this juncture for fear of further decline. the fall to the low of 1,812.78 on jan 11 was due to the change of stock trading behaviour from conservative to aggressive and also the willingness of the sellers to lower their offers to chase the next available buyers in line. given the downside violation of the 1,813 level on an intraday basis, many market participants were believed to be worrying now that those sellers who wanted to liquidate their stock positions earlier but did not get their selling orders done may turn panic and send the benchmark index lower later, it said.  the research house said while it is not an easy task to foresee whether the 1,813 level could hold or be broken on the downside, but it will not be a bad idea to remain patient, follow the rules and be objective about the market. it said following the down close on jan 11, there should be selling attempt again with immediate support at 1,813. it said a downside breakout of 1,813 would put pressure on the market down to the subsequent support at 1,800. the analysis of overall market action on jan 11 revealed that buying power was weaker than selling pressure. as such, the fbm klci would likely trade below the 1,812.78 level on jan 12, said alliancedbs research. based on corporate announcements and news flow yesterday,

opportunity ahead", "article": " by kenny yee head of research, rakuten trade bursa malaysia has had a jekyll and hyde performance this year. the fbm klci touched a high of 1,796.75 points before retreating to the current levels, amid subdued participation from foreign investors. at the height of the local bourses performance, total inflow of foreign funds surpassed the rm12 billion mark but the amount has dwindled to rm10.2 billion currently. nonetheless, following the rather severe foreign outflow in august, september and october, we noticed that foreign participation gathered momentum in december  foreign inflow passed the rm800 million threshold, and counting, at the time of writing. thus, we expect the malaysian stock market to experience improved trading activities in the first quarter of next year in the run-up to the general election. the recently released corporate results for 3q2017 were unexciting, hence the more conservative stance adopted by the research fraternity. despite the prevailing lacklustre performance of bursa malaysia, we believe interest will return when the realignment of portfolios takes place, thus we maintain our positive stance on the benchmark index. we remain staunch advocates of a stronger ringgit as the currency is still the most undervalued in the region. it has the closest correlation to the renminbi/us dollar movements, and we reckon this could only be positive for the ringgit going forward as the renminbi is set to gain its momentum vis-u00e0-vis the us dollar. we see the ringgit re-testing 4.00 against the us dollar and thereafter, to around the 3.80 level. our main concern over the local bourse would be the bubble on wall street, which may derail investors confidence, especially during the quantitative tightening. as for next year, we see pockets of opportunities in the local bourse. we expect the strengthening of the ringgit to be an important catalyst as foreign funds may consider this as a strong pull factor to preserve their investments in the country. it is interesting that the ringgit has remained steadfast over the last few months despite the weakness in the domestic equity market. foreign funds had liquidated their equity positions for the august to october period  totalling rm1.6 billion of foreign outflows. notwithstanding this, we believe foreign monies are staying put in the domestic financial system and are expected to return to the equity market anytime soon. additionally, we may see fresh foreign funds entering the country as the local asset class offers more stability compared with others in the region  we have underperformed the region. we reckon foreign participation will heighten since the valuation of the fbm klci is deemed attractive compared with its regional peers. thus, we expect the fbm klci to chart above 1,900 next year, with our target of 1,910 premised on a market valuation of 16 times and corporate earnings growth of 6.6%, supported by the banking sector that is projected to see earnings expand 8.3% next year. as seen in the table, the fbm klcis valuations are still at reasonable levels  the index is trading below its five-year average while the rest, except for singapore, are currently above or on a par with their respective five-year average per. meanwhile, from a macro perspective, brent crude has improved to above us$63  an 11% improvement from the start of the year. this is a positive sign for the budget 2018 as it was tabled based on crude prices of us$52 a barrel. this provides the government with some buffer when administering its expenditure going forward, without putting pressure on the fiscal deficit. for 2018, private consumption and construction activities, which are envisaged to grow at 7.5% and 6.8% respectively, are expected to be the main impetus to drive domestic economic activities. as for the performance of the sectors, even though there are no obvious outperformers, we favour the banking, construction and consumer sectors. banks: despite the outlook being clouded by concerns over mfrs9 on potential higher credit costs, loan growth is expected to be decent and is projected to grow 4% to 5% next year, spearheaded by household loans. we expect corporate loans/financing to moderate next year with corporates opting for the debt market for financing to mitigate the impact of higher interest rates. we still see good value propositions from affin holdings bhd, cimb group holdings bhd, hong leong bank bhd, rhb bank bhd and malayan banking bhd. construction: we expect construction news flow to improve in cy2018, predominantly from high-profile mega projects, namely the pan borneo highway and east coast rail line (ecrl). the ecrl (rm55 billion) has been pushed into the limelight after the release of budget 2018  the project is to be carried out next year. other transport-related projects such as the mass rapid transit line 2 (rm32 billion), light rail transit line 3 (rm9 billion) and kuala lumpur-singapore high speed rail (rm50 billion to rm60 billion) will also be in focus next year. we reckon recent market weakness presents an excellent opportunity for an accumulation exercise and we prefer the likes of advancecon holdings bhd, ahmad zaki resources bhd, gamuda bhd, hss engineers bhd, ijm corp bhd and kerjaya prospek group bhd. consumer: the retail sub-segment is expected to experience some improvement next year on the back of a 1% reduction in personal income tax. though the impact may be muted, we reckon the marginal improvement in disposable income will lead to more demand for household necessities. meanwhile, the stronger ringgit may play a part in terms of cheaper imports, hence potential margins expansion, particularly for players with a high import content. our picks within this sector include fraser & neave holdings bhd, bison consolidated bhd, 7-eleven malaysia holdings bhd and power root bhd. in view of the possible improvement in trading participation going forward, we believe interest in the small/mid-cap space will follow suit accordingly, buoyed by the pickup in liquidity in the local bourse. thus, for those seeking the alpha-play, we advocate that they look at fundamentally sound smaller-cap companies such as advancecon, azrb, hss, kelington group bhd, kub malaysia bhd, perak transit bhd and straits inter logistics bhd, which are looking attractive following recent price weaknesses. for those keen on the bigger caps, we like british american tobacco (m) bhd, lotte chemical titan holding bhd, petronas gas bhd and tenaga nasional bhd.

countrys second smallest banking group can keep costs in check and deliver on a plan to reduce its cost-to-income ratio (cir)  the highest in the industry  to under 50% by 2020. it looks to have gone off track with that target this year due to a one-off cost of rm48 million incurred in the third quarter for its voluntary separation scheme (vss) and high marketing-related expenses. this pushed its cir up to 65% for the nine months to date, compared with the industry average of 48.4%. its cir stood at 56.5% in fy2016. analysts say affins operating expenditure (opex) is likely to stay elevated in fy2018 due to its ongoing transformation plan, known as affinity, which may require additional but necessary expenses. these include investment in its digital banking initiatives, which is expected to go into full gear next year, and hiring of additional 50-100 staff by this year-end. we expect elevated cir in fy2018 due to the digitisation exercise, says kenanga research. analysts reckon it will be an uphill battle for affin to meet its cir target of under 50% by 2020 as costs stay elevated amid moderate income growth. most expect its cir to stay at just above the 60% level over the next two years. nevertheless, group ceo kamarul ariffin mohd jamil tells the edge that affin is committed to bringing down its costs. i would like to stress that we are committed to reducing our cir to be in line with the industry. furthermore, we are not expecting any further one-off costs in fy2017, he says via email. the vss in the third quarter affected some 330 staff, some of whom will be replaced at lower cost, say analysts. affin will still need to hire staff to execute its transformation initiatives. management expects that the positive impact of the vss will likely come in around a period of 2u00bd years via cost savings, midf research says. we believe that the cost incurred due to personnel is currently necessary to ensure that it is operating efficiently. we like the fact that the percentage of front-end personnel to total staff has increased, as this has a direct impact on income growth, it adds. affins mix of support to front-end staff has moved to 50:50, from 65:35, since the start of the affinity programme. its 3q2017 net profit of rm73.26 million was 47.5% lower year on year (y-o-y) and 50.6% lower quarter on quarter(q-o-q). net profit for the cumulative nine months, at rm341.84 million, was down 12.9% from a year ago, due to higher opex  particularly from the vss  and provisions. excluding the vss cost, its earnings would have still been lower, by an estimated 3.6% y-o-y. it was the only one of the listed banking groups with results that fell below analysts expectations, with 9m2017 earnings coming in at just 60.8% of consensus estimates for the full year. kamarul ariffin explains the poorer earnings: the group incurred higher staff cost (vss and recruitment exercise) as we embarked on our affinity strategic transformation programme, which is due for completion in 2019. higher recruitment (about 300-plus staff) was mainly for our sme and consumer banking and control functions. we expect our staff cost to normalise in fy2018. in addition, higher marketing and promotion expenses were recorded due to an increase in our assets under management (aum) and securities trading volume. analysts say affins provisions, which grew 29.6% y-o-y to rm28.8 million in 3q but was 19.8% lower q-o-q, will likely ease in 4q as it expects several of its large restructured and rescheduled loan accounts  the bulk being in real estate  to be reclassified as performing. its gross impaired loans ratio stood at 2.16% as at end-september, compared with 2.07% three months earlier. we believe the reclassification of these accounts will provide a boost to earnings in fy2019, given the potential writebacks, says midf research. on a positive note, affin posted an impressive increase in non-interest income, which grew 37.1% y-o-y to rm673.2 million in the nine months, mainly because of strong fee income growth. our aum has improved from rm35.5 billion (sept 30, 2016) to rm43.5 billion (sept 30, 2017) and we expect our non-interest income largely from our asset management business to continue its growth trajectory, says kamarul ariffin. he says affin is maintaining its loan growth target of 4% to 5% for this year as momentum is likely to pick up from several disbursements of corporate accounts, sme and consumer segment. corporate loans make up slightly more than half of affins total portfolio. given its attractive valuation, some research houses, including cimb research and kenanga research, have positive recommendations on affins stock. trading at about 0.5 times book value compared with the industry average of 1.4 times, affin is the cheapest of the malaysian banking stocks. others, however, have a more cautious stance. despite the cheap valuation for affin, we believe the stock would struggle to rerate as investors continue to seek asset quality stabilisation and improvement in earnings delivery. affin may also miss out on the potential interest rate hike boon for banks [next year] given its high proportion of fixed-rate loans (37% of total loans) and low proportion of low-cost funding, says dbs group research, which has a hold call on the stock. it expects affins cir to come in at 67% this year before tapering down to 63% by fy2019. bloomberg data shows that of the eight analysts who track the stock, five have hold calls while three have a buy, with a 12-month target price average of rm2.61. the stock closed at rm2.34 last thursday, up just 0.6% year to date. meanwhile, affins group reorganisation is understood to be on track, with the expected transfer of its listing status to affin bank bhd in march next year.

per barrel as of writing. recall that sapura energy was selected as one of the stock picks for the year as it could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the oil production cut between opec and non-opec members. in line with the o&g sectors recovery theme on improved sentiment following gradual recovery in oil prices, most analysts are optimistic about a turnaround story for sapura energy. bloomberg data show that the average 12-month tp for the group is at about rm1.28, indicating a potential return of 62% from its current price of 78.5 sen. following the announcement of its financial results as well as the decline in its share price, analysts have made changes to the recommendation with midf research downgrading sapura energy to hold while kenanga reduced the stock to underperform. cimb research and maybank investment bank research remain positive about sapura energy, as cimb upgraded the stock to buy with a lower tp of rm1.42 from rm1.63 while maybank ib research kept its buy call on the stock with a lower tp of rm1.20 from its previous rm2.  by samantha ho  genting malaysia bhd expectation of an influx of visitors from china to the hilltop casino resort put genting malaysia back on many institutional investors buying list. in addition, the progressive launch of the genting integrated tourism plan also raised expectation of better earnings. given the fresh growth catalysts, genting malaysia was listed as one of the edge financial dailys stock picks for the year. the return of foreign interest on bursa malaysia in the first half of the year helped fuel the share-price rally. the stock started the year on a firm note and it climbed to record-high rm6.14 from rm4.60  a strong rally that had not happened in five years, at least. genting malaysia, which was once foreign investors darling, garnered less attention since some macau-based casino operators and its sister company genting singapore plc were listed in hong kong and singapore respectively. however, the rally lost steam as genting malaysias earnings performance did not meet expectations in its 2qfy17 ended june 30, 2017 and 3qfy17. furthermore, foreign selling in the second half of the year dragged the counter to a low of rm4.90, down 20% from the peak. for its 3qfy17, stripping out various exceptional items, genting malaysias core profit was down by 45% to rm259 million. analysts noticed that the groups costs had gone up, such as staff and finance costs, which hurt its profitability.  by kathy fong  sime darby bhd the change of guard at sime darby bhds controlling shareholder permodalan nasional bhd (pnb) threw the diversified conglomerate into the limelight. expectation of pnbs chairman tan sri abdul wahid omar restructuring sime darby to unlock asset value prompted many to take a second look at the big-cap counter. in january, sime darby announced its restructuring exercise. the conglomerate adopted a pure play strategy, breaking the group into three listed entities, namely sime darby bhd, which houses the auto, industrial, logistics and other businesses; sime darby plantation bhd and sime darby property bhd. shares in the plantation and property arms were distributed to shareholders. meanwhile, both sime darby plantation and sime darby property were listed by introduction on bursa malaysia without issuing new shares to raise fresh capital. the listing reference price for sime darby plantation was pegged at rm5.59 while sime darby propertys was rm1.50. given the renewed interest, sime darbys share price staged a rally, climbing from the rm8-level to a four-year high of rm9.62. if an investor had 1,000 sime darby shares at the start of the year, he would have gained about 8.52% as of dec 15 by holding 1,000 shares in each of sime darby listed members now. sime darby closed at rm2.12, sime darby plantation rm5.25 and sime darby property rm1.42 last friday.  by kathy fong  bumi armada bhd bumi armada bhd, which is controlled by tycoon tan sri ananda krishnan, is one of the two o&g stocks among the edge financial dailys stock picks for the year. the worlds largest floating production storage and offloading (fpso) operator fell victim to the fierce selldown in the o&g sector for two years, falling from the height of rm2.60 in 2014 to nearly 50 sen late last year. it was hammered down to oversold zone then. bumi armadas share price rebounded this year, although not strongly. it climbed above 80 sen in april; it later hovered in the tight range of between 70 sen and 80 sen in the second half of the year. the improved earnings have lent support to bumi armadas share price. the group returned to the black in its 9mfy17 ended sept 30, 2017 after it had been loss-making for two years. the group posted a net profit of rm288.4 million, a sharp contrast to a net loss of rm591.6 million in the previous corresponding period. revenue ballooned almost 44% to rm1.74 billion against rm1.211 billion a year ago. the groups better performance was mainly boosted by the four major floating production and operation projects, which have been coming online in stages. bumi armadas firm order book as of sept 30 was approximately rm22.7 billion, with additional optional extensions of up to rm13.1 billion, according to the companys latest statement on quarterly earnings.  by kathy fong"}, "17":

" in a move to venture into the e-payment and e-commerce space, puc bhd is expected to launch a new electronic money service platform in the middle of next month, followed by an e-money scheme in the first half of next year, according to sources. its going to be malaysias first homegrown social marketing platform and e-wallet, bringing a new way to save on shopping and help sellers get more shoppers to boost their brands and sales, a source tells the edge. it is learnt that puc will introduce the unconventional services to the market in phases next year. all details and the targeted timeline for each phase will be revealed at the mid-december launch. another source highlights that e-wallet is a lucrative area of growth in the modern economy and, hence, pucs scheme will promote customer-to-customer (c2c) payments to shoppers. moving forward, puc may even promote more financial services to shoppers. it will enable c2c payments based on convenience-centric lifestyle activities such as seamless dining bill-splitting, he says. puc is also exploring services that will bridge the gap between shoppers and convenient financial services. however, all these are subject to obtaining the necessary licences from the authorities. puc, formerly known as puc founder (msc) bhd, is an ace market-listed information technology solutions provider that is also involved in renewable energy, media and advertising as well as e-payment processing services. to recap, in early september, puc obtained conditional approval as an e-money issuer from bank negara malaysia. the group also has two subsidiaries with moneylending licences. in a filing with bursa malaysia on sept 7, puc announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, epp solution sdn bhd, had been given approval to issue e-money within a year. epp solution  also a registered business with bank negara for merchant acquiring services  will be joining a list of at least 25 non-bank entities that have been given approval to issue e-money via their mobile apps. other players include aeon credit service (m) bhd, alipay malaysia sdn bhd, axiata digital ecode sdn bhd, managepay services sdn bhd, paypal pte ltd, touch n go sdn bhd and xox com sdn bhd. five banks, namely ambank (m) bhd, bank of china (m) bhd, cimb bank bhd, malayan banking bhd and rhb bank bhd, have also received the green light from the central bank to become e-money issuers. for perspective, there are two types of e-money schemes  the small scheme and the large scheme  which are determined by the purse size and the outstanding e-money liabilities. puc said in the sept 7 announcement that it has obtained approval from bank negara to issue e-money under the large scheme, which refers to a maximum purse limit of rm1,500. in comparison, the small scheme only allows a maximum purse limit of rm200. it is worth noting that puc recently embarked on a few exclusive collaborations with some start-ups, paving the way for the company to build its e-wallet business. last month, puc announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, founder qube sdn bhd (fq), has signed a memorandum of understanding with hong kong-based advwhere ltd for a collaboration, where fq will be appointed with the exclusive right to sell cloudbreakr digital advertisement placement solutions across malaysia, indonesia and singapore. puc is also teaming up with point-of-sale services provider bersian technology (m) sdn bhd to implement a cross-marketing collaboration. in june, puc signed an exclusive partnership agreement with laputa ventures sdn bhd to use the latters advertising platform, dubbed moola, to offer on-vehicle advertising.  variation to utilisation of proceeds while puc has obtained approval as an e-money issuer and identified its partners, it needs the funds to launch the service. it has said rm36.45 million had been allocated for the rolling out of the e-money scheme. interestingly, the money will be coming from the rm42.65 million raised from a rights issue of irredeemable convertible unsecured loan stocks (iculs) in february last year. puc is in the process of obtaining clearance from the relevant regulators to vary the utilisation of the proceeds. puc has submitted its request to securities commission malaysia. barring any unforeseen circumstances, the company should be able to call an extraordinary general meeting as early as december to get shareholders approval, says a source familiar with the company. to recap, the edge in april reported that puc had net cash of rm43.3 million, rm42.65 million of which it cannot use for any purpose other than to expand its renewable energy business. in october 2015, puc proposed the issuance of iculs with warrants to raise up to rm83.9 million, but only managed to get rm42.65 million to fund its solar expansion programme. in february last year, jack cheong chia chieh, the chief of puc, died of a sudden illness at the age of 44. market observers have pointed out that his brother and successor, cheong chia chou, who was appointed the new managing director last december, is not keen on the renewable energy business that was started by the late chia chieh. instead, he is more interested in developing the companys it business. under the feed-in-tariff programme, puc currently operates a 1mw capacity solar photovoltaic power plant in sungai petani, kedah. the output will be supplied to tenaga nasional bhd at a fixed rate. to date, however, puc has yet to be awarded any new project despite efforts to apply for quota with the sustainable energy development authority of malaysia and energy commission. year to date, shares of puc have risen 223%. the stock closed at 21 sen last thursday, giving the company a market capitalisation of rm284

banks, which have suffered shrinking net interest margins (nims) for more than three years, are likely to see wider margins next year, should bank negara malaysias (bnm) hawkish policy translate into an overnight policy rate (opr) hike. investment analysts opine that banks would see their nims widen when the central bank raises its opr. however, the current soft loan growth and the expected increase in deposit rate in line with an opr hike would minimise the positive impact on the banks bottom line. the consensus estimates are that bnm is likely to raise its opr by 25 basis points. over the short term, the repricing of the loans will be ahead of adjustments on the deposit rate, so this will be positive for interest income at least for one to two quarters after the opr hike later this would be neutralised by the [increase] in deposit rates, aminvestment bank analyst kelvin ong told the edge financial daily. ong said that the level of impact on individual banks would vary, depending on their composition of variable interest rate and fixed interest rate loans in its respective portfolios. it comes down to the percentage of the variable rate and fixed rate loans that the individual bank has, and the maturity period of the deposits placed with the bank as well. deposits which are locked in for [a] longer tenure, for example fixed deposits, would be more advantageous as there is a longer time [before the higher interest paid neutralises the higher interest rates on loans earned by the bank], ong explained. nims of malaysian banks have been declining irrespective of interest rate direction since 2014 mainly due to the rising cost of funding, according to nomura securities analyst tushar mohata, and this was a major cause of return of equity erosion among the banks over the last five years. however, with loan growth having slowed, deposit growth is outpacing loan growth for the first time in a while, and banks have improved nim guidance  from an earlier guidance of five to 10 basis points compression to a low single-digit compression . the policy rate hike could have a marginally positive impact on nim for malaysian banks in this scenario, he told the edge financial daily. tushar concurred that the impact would be more positive for banks with a high proportion of variable rate loans and high long-dated term deposits. however, given that credit growth is slow to begin with, a hike in interest might delay the expansion in banks loan book further. so even though nim will increase marginally, the positive impact might be somewhat offset by a slow loan growth as a result of rate hike, he said. midf research senior analyst imran yassin yusof opined that though there is expected to be an improvement in nim from the opr hike, its positive impact would be somewhat moderated by the implementation of the mfrs 9  financial instruments accounting standard next year, whereby banks are required to estimate expected credit losses throughout the lifetime of the loans given. with mfrs 9 next year, provisions could be higher for banks, but these could be moderated by higher nim earned this of course would depend on the timing of the opr hike as it would take time for the repricing of loans to be reflected. it wouldnt be like today there is an opr hike and tomorrow you get a new loan pricing. it takes at least one or two months he said when contacted by the edge financial daily. on whether the opr hike is a strong enough catalyst for investors to relook at banking stocks, aminvests ong opined that it is one, but it wont be the sole catalyst driving the banking sector next year. some of the banking stocks have started to look attractive due to the recent retracement in share prices; other positive is the reduction in competition among banks for deposits due to deferment of net stable funding ratio to jan 1, 2019 [from jan 1, 2018], which would be more favourable to nims. stronger improvement in capital market deals would also help to boost the non-interest income portion of banks, he said. on stock picks for the sector, nomuras tushar has maintained its buy call on public bank bhd and cimb group holdings bhd. we believe public banks underperformance should reverse as the company is one of the best proxies for the malaysia consumer [sentiment] recovery, with 93% of its loan book coming from malaysia and mainly in retail, and its resilient asset quality means that provisioning is less likely to impact earnings negatively. we view cimb as the only meaningful turnaround story in terms of roe (return on equity), which we forecast will rise from 8.2% in 2016 to [about] 10% in 2018, notwithstanding the impact of mfrs 9. this is mainly due to its earnings recovery as credit costs decline, and its cost initiatives such as the proposed securities joint venture [with china galaxy securities co], which are likely to positively contribute to earnings in 2018, said tushar."}, "42": {"date_posted": "22/11/2017", "title":

profit in 3qfy17 is expected to fall 16.6% to rm295 million compared with rm353.9 million a year ago, according to bloomberg data. this is despite a predicted increase in revenue to rm2.46 billion in

"article": " news of tan sri mokhzani mahathir offering to sell 605 million shares or a 10.1% stake in sapura energy bhd on nov 2, while not considered a surprise to some, has, nevertheless, affected investor sentiment towards the oil and gas group. however, analysts opine that this will be mitigated in the short term. without his (mokhzanis) disposal, fundamentally, the share price should be higher, says aminvestment analyst alex goh. midf research analyst aaron tan concurs. mokhzanis share sale at a discount is a normal business decision, he says. the disposal seems natural. he had not held a top position in the company since 2015. the day the news broke, sapura energy was among the top losers and the most traded counters. its share price fell 17 sen or 10.5% to its intra-day low of rm1.45 on nov 2  its biggest one-day loss since august 2015  but later recovered to rm1.49, down 8.02%, with 79.85 million shares traded. mokhzani had offered to sell the shares, held by his british virgin island-registered company, khasera baru ltd, at between rm1.42 and rm1.49 apiece. cimb was appointed the sole book runner for the deal, reuters reported. last tuesday, mokhzani ceased to be a substantial shareholder in sapura energy after khasera baru sold 384.97 million shares for rm577.46 million or rm1.42 apiece, which was below its closing price of rm1.50. after the sale, khasera baru is left with 220.03 million shares or a 3.67% stake. mokhzani still holds 0.16% equity interest in the company. another of his private vehicle, kencana capital sdn bhd, holds 0.08%. sapura energy has continued trending downwards since, closing one sen or 0.69% lower at rm1.45 last friday. khasera baru obtained the shares from khasera baru sdn bhd  also owned by mokhzani  back in july 2015 through a share transfer, bursa malaysia filing shows. the latest share disposal by khasera baru could be at a loss for mokhzani. this is the second time he is selling a substantial stake in sapura energy, formerly known as sapurakencana petroleum bhd. sapura energy shares held by mokhzani and khasera baru were first made available to them during the merger exercise between kencana petroleum bhd and sapuracrest petroleum bhd, in which they were shareholders. the merger was done through special purpose vehicle integral key sdn bhd in may 2012, with the owners of both companies receiving cash payments and shares in the merged entity. kencana petroleum was offered rm5.98 billion or rm3 per share  via rm969 million cash and 2.51 billion shares in sapurakencana petroleum at an indicative price of rm2 apiece. the deal valued khasera barus 31.81% stake in the company at around rm1.9 billion. minus the cash portion, khasera baru received 795.32 million shares or a 13.27% stake in the merged entity, valued at rm1.59 billion. mokhzani got 9.49 million shares or a 0.16% stake. on feb 18, 2014, khasera baru sold 190.3 million sapurakencana shares at rm4.30 apiece or rm820 million in total. khasera baru netted a profit of rm439 million in that deal. the timing then was good  crude prices crashed seven months later that year. since then, shares of sapura energy have slumped amid the global oil glut. the stock has yet to recover. the latest share disposal by mokhzani did raise some eyebrows, considering sapura energys share price is currently hovering at its five-year low. furthermore, mokhzanis exit came at a time when the price of brent crude oil is recovering. brent crude breached the us$60-per-barrel mark in end-october and was trading above us$63 per barrel last friday. on that note, aminvestment banks goh opines that sapura energys prospects, too, will be brighter, after a worse-than-expected performance in the first half of its financial year ending jan 31, 2018 (fy2018). earnings recovery is likely to come from sapura energys exploration and production segment, he says. the groups website shows that it has four blocks of production assets off kerteh, terengganu, and five exploration assets in sabah and sarawak. considering the assets it acquired from newfield previously and other production sharing contracts with petronas, the company can definitely benefit from higher realised prices per barrel. on top of that, higher oil prices should boost investor confidence, especially when talking to banks for future financing, says goh, who places a fair value of rm1.54 on the counter. midfs tan concurs, but points out that sapura energys drilling segment will continue to go through a gestation period before its clients are sufficiently convinced of market prospects to give out more contracts. the drilling segment is still making losses as its tender rigs are not fully utilised. they are maintaining their vessel count, he says. sapura energy has guided analysts that it will see only five rigs utilised by end-fy2018, from six in september. just last month, it bought over a heavy-lift and pipelay vessel, sapura 3000, after discontinuing its joint venture with london-based subsea 7 sa. tan also expects sapura energys engineering and construction segment to see weaker yard utilisation rate in the coming quarters with the completion of some major projects in 3qfy2018. he has a neutral call on the stock, with a target price of rm1.69. bloomberg data shows that analyst coverage is broadly mixed on the counter, with three sell, five hold and four buy calls. there is also one outperfrom call. the target price ranges from rm1.30 to rm2.15.

ruffled by possible klci exclusion ", "article": " british american tobacco (m) bhds (bat) share price has been declining since the stock peaked at rm63.54 apiece on dec 1, 2014. the question is, how much further will it drop. a look at the tobacco companys share price performance indicates that it has been through a rough year. just last week, the counter shed 6.9% to close at rm37.70 on nov 2, from rm40.50 on oct 30. at rm37.70 apiece, it marked a five-year low for the counter, which is almost 70% off its peak price. a look at bats financial performance for its nine months ended sept 30, 2017 (9mfy2017), does not paint a rosy picture. for 9mfy2017, bat reported a net profit of rm401.5 million, compared with rm432.95 million in the previous corresponding period  a year-on-year decline of 7.3%. earnings came in below consensus estimates, accounting for 67.3% of full-year forecasts, says hong leong investment bank research analyst sheikh abdullah in an oct 23 report. we cut our fy2017 to fy2019 forecasts by 5% to take into account a lower volume assumption and higher operating expenditure assumptions in anticipation of higher investments in its new brand, rothmans. despite showing signs of improvement, the market share of illicit cigarettes remains high at 56%, thus reinforcing our negative outlook for the sector, he says. while high excise duties and illicit cigarettes are the main contributors to bats decline, the possibility of the stock being excluded from the benchmark ftse bursa malaysia klci index coincides with the plunging share price. on oct 26, cimb investment bank analyst ivy ng lee fang noted that the demerger of sime darby bhd into sime darby plantation bhd and sime darby property bhd would alter the make-up of the 30-stock fbm klci. our current break-up market valuations for sime darby are: (i) rm44.7 billion for sime darby plantation; (ii) rm13 billion for sime darby property; and (iii) rm10.4 billion for sime darby (post-demerger). assuming these entities trade in line with our break-up value estimates upon listing, and applying the ground rules, sime darby plantation and sime darby property may be added into the fbm klci, and bat or ijm corp as well as sime darby could be deleted, says ng in the report. this report was followed by an oct 31 note by phillip wong of amresearch, who says: apart from the potential capital market impact on bat, we think perpetual regulatory hurdles and disruptive substitute tobacco products do not justify its lofty valuations (forward price-earnings ratio [per] of 19.8 times versus a historical average of 17.7 times). at last thursdays closing price of rm37.70, bats market capitalisation amounted to rm10.76 billion, making it the smallest stock by market capitalisation on the klci. meanwhile, bats dividends, one of the main selling points for the stock, have been declining on a per share basis since fy2016 as net profit shrinks. nevertheless, based on its present share price of rm37.70, dividend yield stands at 5.39%  still a handsome return compared with other stocks on the exchange. it should also be noted that the company has been consistent in its dividend payout ratio over the last few years, paying out more than 95% of earnings. however, the pertinent question now is whether the dividends can be maintained considering the myriad challenges the tobacco industry faces  from illegal cigarettes to high excise duties. when contacted, a bat spokesperson tells the edge that the company is committed to paying dividends above 90% of earnings. to recap, in march last year, bat announced that it was closing down its manufacturing operations in malaysia and sourcing its tobacco products for the local market from other manufacturing facilities in the region. the restructuring is in line with the groups efforts to realise a new and more sustainable business model, amid an increasingly challenging business environment, it says in its 2016 annual report. the land and building in petaling jaya was sold in november last year, with the proceeds from the sale going back to shareholders in the form of a special dividend at 46 sen per share in fy2016. as at june 30, the company has successfully transitioned to importing its tobacco products and ceased domestic production of cigarettes. the shift to fully importing its tobacco products seems to have paid off. gross margins for its third quarter ended sept 30, 2017 (3qfy2017), improved to 36.5% from 34.7% a year earlier. bat recently entered the value-for-money (vfm) segment with its new product, rothmans. the price of the cigarettes, which retail at rm12 per pack, is below its peter stuyvesant and pall mall (rm15.50 each) brands and its premium brand, dunhill (rm17 per pack). analysts are generally positive on bats move into the vfm segment as it is the fastest-growing product segment. this allows bat to compete with its peers in this segment, especially to capture customers with lower affordability and narrow the pricing difference between its products versus illicit cigarettes, says a cimb research report. although the move to the vfm segment has been touted as necessary, some analysts say it could result in the cannibalisation of its premium dunhill brand and consequently, the dilution of revenue growth and margins. we believe this will drag down its overall margins, given that vfm products have lower margins versus products in other segments. on top of that, we believe that this will also lead to the cannibalisation of market share of its higher margin product segments, says cimb research. for 3qfy2017, bats net profit fell 32.7% to rm143.18 million from a year ago, while revenue shrank 18.8% to rm757.28 million. the weakness comes on the back of lower sales volume, higher operating cost from the expenses of a new product range and an elevated level of illegal cigarettes in the market. as at august, bat reported that illegal cigarettes stood at 56.1% of the market, a slight decline from 58.9% in april. nevertheless, bats market share declined to 53.9% in 3qfy2017 from 54.5% in the second quarter. it is worth noting that bats sales volume declined 1.7% quarter on quarter, even though the broader market grew 3%, highlights aminvestment research. that said, many analysts believe that the proliferation of illegal cigarettes and the tight regulatory controls on the tobacco industry will continue to weigh down the company. there are five buy, 10 hold and four sell calls on bat, according to bloomberg data, with an average target price of rm43.42. bat is trading at a per of 15.35 times.

booster for the stock is the supply cut in china, which is expected to help improve demand for local glove players. loo, who has a sell call on hartalega with a target price (tp) of rm6.87, said the group has a lofty valuation besides strong financial performance. he is among three analysts that have a sell call on hartalega. another six analysts have a buy call on the largest manufacturer of

positive view, cimb equity research analyst walter aw said hartalegas success in developing the worlds first non-leaching antimicrobial nitrile examination glove is a testament to its emphasis on product innovation and manufacturing capabilities. although the group has yet to reveal key details such as pricing, we believe this product should be popular with the healthcare industry. hence, this would allow the group to benefit from a pricing premium on this product for a period of time, aw said in a report yesterday. according to him, hartalega should be able to command a pricing premium of 10% to 15% for the product in the short term. michelle foong of rhb research institute has the highest tp for the group among the analysts, at rm9.35. foong upgraded her previous neutral call to a buy call, after hartalega reported higher first-half (1h) net profit for the financial year ending march 31, 2018 (fy18), led by sales volume growth and net profit margin improvements. the results were in line with our estimates, but ahead of street forecasts, foong said in her report last week. we expect it to report a stronger 2hfy18, given new demand drivers and moderating input costs. affin hwang investment bank, on the other hand, feels that hartalega shares have been fairly priced, notwithstanding the strong financial performance. the strong performance was driven by both higher sales volume and better gross profit margin for its nitrile gloves. we believe that the current earnings momentum is sustainable as additional production lines are expected to come on stream progressively, with the completion of plant 4 of its next generation integrated glove manufacturing complex. despite the strong performance, we are maintaining our hold call on the stock, as we believe that the shares are fairly valued, it said in a report last week. hartalegas share price closed 1.72% higher at rm8.85 yesterday, with 3.3 million shares changing hands, giving it a market capitalisation of rm14.6

the borrowing costs will kill us ... if foreign parties can give us 3% then why not, its good for all of us, mrt corp chief executive officer datuk seri shahril mokhtar told the edge financial daily. shahrils comments come after some research houses suggested that no local companies seem to fit the role as lead contractor based on mrt corps notice of tender issued earlier this week for mrt3, also

for the engineering, procurement, construction, testing and commissioning of the 40km rail project. a particularly thorny requirement is the turnkey contractor has to propose a financing package of up

jumping to any conclusions. we are actually hoping for the [local construction] companies to create joint ventures or some consortium ... they can even partner foreign parties. you must understand its

reflect higher-margin recurring earnings from a rm4.2 billion outstanding order book for road maintenance and billings for its high rm718 million construction order book. we forecast earnings recovery from fy18 to fy19, with a three-year earnings per share compound annual growth rate of 10% (fy16-fy19f). its current share price is 19% lower than the previous high in 2016 and at a massive 55% discount to the end of fy18f revalued net asset value (rnav). we believe most of the negatives (disappointing fy16 results, likely sustained weak earnings in fy17f and legacy issues) are reflected in the current share price. the stock could be catalysed by: i) a revival in contract flows, ii) election plays, and iii) revival in affordable housing contracts (protascos niche area). protascos dividend appeal is supported by stable earnings from its road maintenance concessions. we forecast a dividend payout ratio of 60% in the fy17-fy19f (consistent with historical ratios) period and exclude potential special dividends. its fy18-fy19f dividend yields of 6%-7% (our estimates) are the highest in the sector and among the small-cap contractors. protascos current share price implies that investors would essentially be paying for only its road maintenance division (which accounts for 44% of our end of the fy18f rnav per share of rm2.39) and getting other assets for free. construction, property development, trading/manufacturing and education make up the balance 54% of rnav. year to date, protascos share price has marginally increased by 0.7%, compared to the stellar

sen  a sharp discount to the previous days closing of 34.5 sen, evident of irrational panic selling. hovids two production licences were reinstated in march and may separately. subsequently, its share price regained most lost ground. against such a background, its controlling shareholder david ho sue san found an interested party, fajar astoria sdn bhd, a private equity firm, to partner with him for a privatisation exercise. last week, ho together with fajar astoria made a voluntary takeover offer of 38 sen per share and 20 sen per warrant to buy all the shares not owned by them in the pharmaceutical company. upon successful completion of the offer, ho intends to consolidate his interest in the shares and warrants in the name of fajar astoria in exchange for a proportionate shareholding in either fajar astoria or its holding company, tael astoria investments ltd. currently, ho holds a 33.72% stake in hovid, while the partners acting in concert with him, including his wife east jacqueline judith and his siblings, have a collective 0.34% stake in the company. the price is 10% higher than the last trading price before the suspension of its two manufacturing licences. according to its announcement to bursa malaysia, the offer price represents an 18.87% premium to its one-year volume weighted average price of 32 sen. now, for minority shareholders who were unfazed by the suspension of production in january and have held onto their shares, should they take up the takeover offer to exit at this point of time? for the financial year ended june 30, 2017 (fy17), hovid reported a net loss of rm1.53 million, from a net profit of rm17.9 million in fy16. revenue for fy17 came in 10% lower at rm169.93 million from rm189.03 million in fy16. the net loss showed that the suspension of the two manufacturing licences made a big dent in hovids earnings  something that management had forewarned earlier. hovid also encountered labour shortage problems that resulted in a low capacity utilisation rate of about 70%. cimb research, in its quarterly review on sept 4, cut its earnings forecasts for fy18 and fy19 to account for lower production volume and further delays in hovids chemor plant extension. cimb anticipated rm14.6 million, or 1.7 sen per share for fy18. based on last fridays closing price of 36 sen, hovid shares are trading at a forward 12-month price-earnings ratio (per) of 21.18 times, which is relatively higher than its peers. pharmaniaga bhd is trading at a forward per of 17.66 times and ysp southeast asia holding bhd 15.53 times. looking at peer comparisons, the takeover offer seems worth considering based on the earnings forecast of 1.7 sen. but it may be worth noting that the company posted earnings per share of 2.24 sen for fy16. there is a wild card that minority shareholders should not neglect  the new capacity which has been delayed. the extension of capacity is expected to come on stream by year end, according to a fund manager. according to cimb, the chemor plant extension could raise hovids existing tablet and capsule capacity by 70% (from the original capacity). but this will happen gradually. the new capacity will translate into stronger earnings growth in future for hovid when things are falling in place. this may be why fajar astoria is keen on pouring in money to take hovid private  a deal that will cost them about rm243.1 million. hovids production facilities include the 20-acre (8.09ha) chemor plant with softgel packing, effervescent dosage and oral solid dosage facilities, while its three-acre ipoh plant, where its headquarters are in, produces softgel encapsulation, oral liquid, penicillin products and its heritage ho yan hor herbal tea. aside from the manufacturing plants, hovid has a research and development centre in penang which is dedicated to bioequivalence studies. with a market capitalisation of rm295 million, which is less than us$85 million, hovid does appear to be an attractive merger and acquisition (m&a) target for foreign pharmaceutical giants that are looking for capacity expansion in this part of the world. in fact, cimb said that it would turn more positive on hovid upon a stronger-than-expected recovery in sales volume and earlier delivery of the extension of its chemor plant. will minority shareholders wait further for the new capacity to ride on the

the chief investment officer who oversees 40 billion ringgit ($9.5 billion) at eastspring investments bhd. in kuala lumpur. prime minister najib razak has said the budget will address the cost of living for citizens and also housing issues, according to the official bernama news agency. the budget is going to be expansionary, theres no question about it, said chan at eastspring, whose malaysian small and midcap fund has returned an average 24 percent annually over the past five years to beat 90 percent of its peers. its going to be an election budget essentially. najibs spending plan, which will be the final one announced before a national election that must be called by mid-2018, could help spur gains beyond technology companies that have been the best stock performers this year. while malaysia has received rm9.5 billion in foreign investment since the start of january as its economy grew at the fastest pace since 2015, the ftse bursa malaysia klci index has only added 6.9 percent, lagging behind the 23 percent gain by the msci asia pacific index. even as gains on the klci index of 30 companies lagged regional peers, technology-related shares not tracked by the benchmark have fared better. the bursa malaysia technology index, the best performing industry gauge out of 10, has jumped 77 percent this year and closed at a 12-year high on friday, driven by the global demand for electronic products that are fed into the global technology supply chain from the country. property developers including mah sing bhd. and sp setia bhd. could benefit from the upcoming budget, as najib is set to address the lack of affordable housing, according to a report by ivy ng lee fang and michelle chia, analysts at cimb group bhd., the nations second-largest bank by assets. this would be an election budget that would pull out all the stops i suppose in terms of ensuring that the rakyat is shielded to a certain extent from the higher cost of living, said geoffrey ng of fortress capital asset management sdn, using the malay term for the citizenry. the budget would likely give a boost to lower-income-related consumption stocks and fortress is trading selected

and, to a certain extent, singapore are more liquid and have cheaper valuations, he said. for eastspring, trends in consumer spending will determine how the stock market performs. investors should watch out for any gains in expenditure on products ranging from cars to basic staples, as government initiatives become the markets next big driver for the following couple of quarters, chan said. malaysias consumer spending surged 7.1 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, rising at the fastest pace in more than two years. clothing retailer padini holdings bhd. has surged 88 percent this year, as profit for the financial year ended june rose 15 percent to rm157.4 million \"you really have to deep dive and research on companies that are still undervalued and

on sept 15, residents of japans northernmost major island hokkaido woke up to deafening sirens blasting from speakers as a ballistic missile launched by north korea flew over the japanese airspace. the missile landed 2,000km to the east of hokkaido in the pacific ocean. it was the latest in a series of provocations between the hermit kingdom and the us, following calls by the world superpower for greater economic sanctions to be imposed on the regime. while major stock markets in asia fell during the day, they resumed their upward trend the next day and week, without any major outflow of foreign funds. the msci asia pacific ex japan added 1.19% between sept 14 and 22. does this mean geopolitical risks are not a major factor for international investors? and as october  historically a dangerous month for capital markets  dawns, should investors be worried for their investments? international fund managers see provocations between north korea and the us as nothing new, and therefore, do not have a heavy bearing on global markets and economy. real economic data would be the main drivers of the stock markets, they say. emerging markets (em) continue to enjoy a sweet spot of improving growth prospects and favourable external conditions: corporate earnings have been improving amid growing evidence of a synchronised global recovery. meanwhile, a weaker dollar is boosting global cross-border liquidity and helping em currencies. this is, in turn, putting downward pressure on inflation, says a spokesperson of us-based asset management company aberdeen standard investments. cimb investment bank bhd sees stronger interest from foreign investors in malaysia now compared with early on in the year, its analysts ivy ng lee fang and michelle chia say in a strategy note dated sept 20. they found that foreign funds are interested in malaysia because of the strong economic growth in the first half. key questions that foreign funds ask are mainly growth numbers, consumer sentiment and timing for the 14th general elections. at the start of the year, foreign investors were more interested in our forex views but that has now shifted to the sustainability of the strong 1h17 gdp growth as well as better appreciation of key drivers behind the gdp. we sensed that foreign investors are now more comfortable with the ringgit, which has appreciated 7.3% ytd to rm4.1875/us$1, say the analysts in the strategy note. another event that might be negative for em assets is the prospect of an interest rate hike by the federal reserve in december, as well as its balance sheet normalisation programme. usually, when a major central bank tightens, funds will flow to safe havens. markets in em asia closed broadly lower last wednesday after us federal reserve chair janet yellen reaffirmed her commitment to hike interest rates. south koreas kospi was down 0.46%, jakarta composite index (-0.31%), and stock exchange of thailand (-0.2%). ftse bursa malaysia klci closed 0.3% lower, in line with its peers in the region, while the shanghai composite index slipped 0.03%. meanwhile, developed asian markets closed higher, led by the straits times index with 0.57% and hang seng index (0.5%). nevertheless, investors do not seem to be too spooked by the prospect of a higher interest rates in the us, normalisation of the feds balance sheet, and heightened geopolitical risks in asia. there seems to be a sense of fatigue among investors when it comes to these factors. in the past, theyve been right to worry. generally, when central banks start tightening, it does affect em. however, this time round, weve already had that event happen back in 2013, so the markets have got over it already, says rajeev de mello, head of asian fixed income at schroders. this is likely because major central bankers have been careful to talk about the normalisation of balance sheets and interest rates, according to de mello. those that are invested should remain confident that there will not be a big drop off in asset values, he says. areca capital sdn bhds ceo danny wong teck meng says as long as the path and pace of the feds rate hikes remains within expectation, foreign fund managers may be swayed by the fundamentals and attach lower risk premiums to malaysia as an investment destination. although many expect em to be negatively impacted, funds will still flow to where growth is, and it is in this part of the world where growth can still be found. em have attracted a straight month of inflows (include debt and equity). this, despite yellen having laid out the feds rate hike plans since 2015 and when the fed first mentioned the idea of reducing the balance sheet in july, says wong. in its asian development outlook (ado) 2017 update

doing much better economically are some of the good news that will support asset prices in these economies. it has also not seen much foreign fund outflows from em assets so far. in asia, chinas economic growth in the second quarter of the year remained stable at 6.9% year on year. south koreas exports is expected to rise for the tenth straight month in september, expanding 21.6% from a year earlier, accelerating from a 17.3% surge in august. malaysias economy has also been doing surprisingly well this year, recording a growth of 5.8% in the second quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago. the adb says that malaysia, alongside hong kong, will see the biggest jump in economic output this year.  how would feds balance sheet normalisation affect investment flows? the fed expanded its balance sheet by buying up government bonds and mortgage-backed securities post global financial crisis (gfc). its balance sheet reached the peak of us$4.5 trillion in october 2014, and has been maintained since then. starting this month (october), the fed will reduce its balance sheet by slowing the reinvestment of maturing bonds. the target is to reduce its balance sheet to us$3 trillion by the start of the next decade. in the past, announcements by the fed regarding normalisation of the quantitative easing and interest rates have caused funds outflow from em to the us and other developed markets, this time round, things are much calmer on the trading floors. in the short term, there will be some negative knee-jerk reaction from the tightening of quantitative measures on equities, with funds to flow back into us bonds. provided the proposed tax cut by the trump administration is not implemented soon, investors and fund managers will put their money in more stable and interesting markets such as japan and southeast asia, says rakuten trades head of research, kenny yee. how does the feds balance sheet normalisation and rising interest rates affect the performance of an investors portfolio? first, investors should expect lower returns from bonds as bond yields are likely resuming their gradual rising trend, says dr shane oliver, head of investment strategy and economics and chief economist at australia-based amp capital. second, shares should be able to withstand the latest leg in fed tightening just as they have since the end of quantitative easing in 2014 and the four rate hikes the fed has undertaken since. shares are still cheap relative to bonds; the fed is only tightening because growth is strong and this means higher profits; and fed monetary policy is a long way from being tight to the extent that it will threaten us or global growth, says oliver. the worlds largest asset manager blackrock has said that it remains overweight in em equities in its investment directions report released last month. however, investors should still be aware of the risks and remain selective. on the bond market, de mello from schroders says that investors have to look for a market that gives the best yield. in asia, indonesia, india and china are countries which offer the highest yields for bonds, and have stable macroeconomic fundamentals. indonesia is one of the countries which we favour: 7% yields for 10-year bonds, a very stable currency; low deficits including a low trade deficit. these are generally all positives for bond investors. chinas bonds also offer potential for investors: 3.5% yields but also the opportunity to have an offset in case there is some risk coming from china. government bonds are usually the safe haven that investors flock to, he says.  eu reform uncertainty the just-concluded 19th federal election in germany saw angela merkel winning her fourth term as the chancellor of the federal republic. however, the election result also put a right-wing party in the bundestag for the first time since the second world war. the result could mean that reform of the european union (eu) will take a longer turn for it to be materialised, says matthias hoppe, senior vice-president, portfolio manager at franklin templeton multi-asset solutions. a widely held view is that merkel and french president emmanuel macron would seek to implement fiscal policies designed both to stimulate the eu economy and deepen european integration. however, we believe bringing about those reforms is likely to prove difficult. merkels general style of government has been more reactive than proactive; she hasnt been known for pushing hard for changes and moving them forward. also, depending on who she is going to seek a coalition with, it could prove more difficult to implement reforms, says hoppe, adding that if the reforms were achievable, it could have substantial implications for capital inflows into equities and bonds in the region. the areas of reform that has been talked about for the eu include the setting up of a finance ministerial post representing the bloc, as well as setting up a european monetary fund. a budget for the eu has also been mooted. however, merkel and macron both have differences in the implementation of these reforms. for instance, while they agreed on having a budget for the eu, their views differ in terms of the size of the budget and financing. the re-election of angela merkel means business as usual to some extent, although her mandate was eroded and she will need to form a potentially messy coalition with new partners. this may lead to greater political risk within the heart of europe. the success of the afd in these elections will also give encouragement to anti-eu voices in other member states, says the aberdeen spokesperson, referring to alternative for germany, the right-wing party that secured almost 13% of the vote in the federal election. while geopolitical risks are heightening in some parts of the world, it does appear that the stronger global economic recovery takes precedence in investors decision-making on where to allocate their money. the feds interest rate hike and balance sheet normalisation have also been well communicated, minimising the impact on em assets. so, while keeping an eye out for any october calamity, keep calm, and hold on tight to your investments.

(2hfy17) and lower gross impaired loan ratio by year end compared to end of june 17. also, the bank stated that the affinity transformation programme has yielded positive results in terms of margins and the loan pipeline. there is an early positive result in which 25 projects have been initiated from the affinity transformation programme as at last month, of which 12 projects have been completed and 13 projects are ongoing. we are positive on the implementation of affinity as it would help improve the groups earnings. the early positive results from affinity are the widening of net interest margins (for loans) from 2.16% in december 2015 to 2.23% in june 2017, and an increase in the stock for undisbursed mortgage loans from rm600 million in 2016 to rm3 billion now. it explained that the 27.3% surge in its total gross impaired loan (gil) in 1hfy17 was due to higher rescheduled and restructured (r&r) loans, which were still performing. in 1hfy17, the r&r loans shot up from rm37 million at end of december 2016 to rm296.2 million at the end of june 2017, lifted by one r&r loan in the property (non-residential) sector. affin expects some of these r&r loans to be reclassified as non-impaired towards end of the year or in early 2018. hence, the groups gil ratio could decline from the 2.07% level at the end of june (above the industrys 1.65%) towards the end of the year. to prepare itself for the adoption of malaysian financial reporting standards 9 (mfrs 9) in 2018, affin proactively increased its regulatory reserves by 107.5% half on half (transferred from retained earnings) to rm601.3 million at the end of june. inclusive of regulatory reserves, the bank recorded a loan loss coverage of 100.9% at june end compared to 94.3% at the end of december 2016. we are positive on this as the high regulatory reserves would help to cushion the expected rise in provisioning upon adoption of mfrs 9 and assuage market concerns about affins low coverage previously. the bank is targeting a 6%-7% loan growth in fy17, above our projected 3%. this means that it is expecting stronger loan momentum of 3.4%-4.4% in 2hfy17 versus only 2.6% in 1hfy17. if the bank achieves its targeted loan growth, our net profit forecast could be raised by 2%-3% in fy17 assuming that there is no significant drop in net interest margin. we keep our add call on affin, given its attractive valuations, and benefits from its affinity transformation programme, which has led to an increase in its margins and loan pipeline. its 2018 price-earnings ratio of 8.1 times is below the sectors average of 12 times and the lowest among the malaysian banks under our coverage. we retain our fy17-fy19f earnings per share forecasts and a tp of rm2.96 based on the divident discount model.

yesterday. if you look at analysts expectations, they are expecting a gross domestic product (gdp) of about 5% for 2017, which by definition would equate to a slower second half, he said. the first half shows that the fundamentals of the economy are still strong, nazir said, adding that the country is also benefiting from a syncronised global recovery. the local economy expanded by 5.8% in the second quarter of 2017 from a year earlier  exceeding the consensus estimate of 5.4%, driven by domestic demand and export growth. for the first half of 2017, gdp grew at 5.7% year-on-year. last

said the establishment of a virtual board that lists out the top companies in asean could be a way to promote greater capital flows within the region. he pointed out that many domestic funds that were looking to diversify their portfolio usually looked towards developed markets, but he said there could be better opportunities in asean. why not we create a virtual board that lists out all the top companies in asean, and make this virtual board visible across asean as a whole? on the board, there should be information on the stock, which exchange it is listed on and information on how these securities can be accessed by the investor, with full transparency on how to invest and eventually divest, he said. nazir said enabling companies to have access to the broadest range of capital providers would also provide a huge boost to the overall value proposition of being part of asean. securities commission malaysia executive chairman tan sri ranjit ajit singh concurred, saying there was a greater propensity for people to invest in markets such as hong kong and the us rather than asean. he noted that at a joint meeting of asean finance ministers and central bank governors in april, a senior finance minister had pointed out that he was able to invest in the us using mobile technology, but could not do so in asean countries. however, ranjit said there are already several brokers around asean who have licences in multiple countries, which allow clients to invest using mobile technology, but the awareness of them is absent. somehow, the awareness of the opportunities for intra-asean trade is not known to the finance minister  and hes a quite a plugged-in individual. you can imagine the cascading effect of that. so, one of the first things that has to be done is to pool together information on what is available out there in asean in an easier manner. we need some sort of asean market information hub, he said. ranjit said the virtual hub should also provide information on taxation policies surrounding settlements and other tax issues. we need to be able to elevate that. otherwise, the notion of an asean asset class remains an aspiration and capital will go elsewhere, he said.\n"}, "94": {"date_posted": "16/8/2017", "title": "klk, batu kawan decline after posting weaker 3q profits", "article": " kuala lumpur (aug 16): kuala lumpur kepong bhd (klk)

"article": " after four long year, prestariang bhd last week finally closed the deal for the coveted immigration and border transformation project, skin, worth rm3.5 billion. an acronym for sistem kawalan imigresen nasional (national immigration control system), skin is a 15-year concession that was supposed to be the key catalyst that would help to justify the groups lofty valuations. but the market does not appear to be convinced. following the announcement last week, prestariangs share price tumbled almost 12.2% to close at rm2.09 last thursday, down from the rm2.38 close pre-announcement. even the groups bullish outlook on its existing core businesses did not seem to sway investors. we expect revenue from our software and services segment to grow by 25% in fy2018, president and group ceo dr abu hassan ismail told the press last week. furthermore, he says the groups training and certification business is expected to see revenue double, fuelled by the prestariang skill training institute (psti) in petronas refinery and petrochemical integrated development (rapid) project in pengerang, johor. abu hassan also assures investors that the groups loss-making education arm, unimy, would break even this year. last but not least, he made sure to play up educloud  prestariangs venture into shared cloud services. but even with partners like alibaba, microsoft and amazon web services, market response has been tepid.  why the poor response? for starters, it is important to note that analysts concur prestariangs profits should improve going forward, from the third quarter at least. a report by cimb investment bank anticipates core earnings to expand by 143% year on year to 17 sen per share in fy2018. even the more conservative estimates by aminvestment bank forecasts core earnings per share to rise 80% y-o-y to 11 sen. the trouble is, the earnings upside simply arent enough to justify the stocks lofty valuations. as at last thursdays close, prestariang was valued at a whopping 112 times earnings. of course, this is expected to fall once the earnings growth trickles in. the fact that prestariang will only control 70% of the skin project did not help matters either.  70%  not enough skin in the game for context, it is important to remember that back when news first broke that prestariang was bidding for the skin project, the expected value of the contract was much higher  as much as rm6 billion. this helped to drive prestariangs share price to over rm3.20 in early 2016. however, uncertainty over whether it could actually bag the contract brought the share price back down to the rm2.20 level over the past year. the companys tumbling earnings (see chart) could not have supported such a high share price either. investors long in the stock at this point were largely betting on the upside potential of skin. thus, it was a relatively nasty surprise that prestariang only has a 70% stake in the concession. recall that the actual concession has been awarded to prestariang skin sdn bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of prestariang services sdn bhd. however, prestariang only controls 70% of prestariang services. another 30% of the company is controlled equally by muhammad nagib gopal abdullah, raja azmi adam nadarajan and faisalludin mohamat yusuff. when asked why a 30% stake was given to these three individuals, abu hassan simply says, these are the original founding members. they are not somebody else. they were actually physically with us from day one, and they continue to be with us to add value to make sure they deliver skin as part of their commitment to the government. note that raja azmi is the ceo of prestariang skin. whatever the reason however, the financial impact of giving away 30% of the project has not gone down well with investors. not only will this dilute the earnings from the concession, but prestariang is expected to bear the entire cost of funding the projects construction, approximately rm1billion over 36 months. assuming the project is 80% financed by debt, a 6% interest rate translates into rm95 million in accrued interest over the first three years of the project. to make matters worse, the exact returns on the project are rather opaque since the internal rate of return (irr) is not disclosed. we have signed a non-disclosure agreement with the government. we are not allowed to reveal the projects irr, abu hassan tells the edge. instead, he simply guides that the project would reap about rm3.5 billion in revenue from year 4 to year 15 of the project. a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that works out to rm204.2 million per annum over the 12-year period. according to analyst reports, prestariangs management is guiding for a net profit margin of up to 38% a year. that works out to about rm77.6 million a year for the company or 16 sen a share.  no cash call? at the press briefing, abu hassan made a bold claim  that the entire project could be funded entirely with debt and internally generated funds alone. we have already secured the guarantees from the banks. the government would not award this project to us unless we show proof that we could finance it, explains abu hassan. an 80:20 debt to equity structure is entirely plausible given that prestariang is debt free, with rm38.6 million in cash and another rm51.9 million in short-term investments. assuming the short-term investments can be liquidated at book value, the company has net cash of rm90.5 million. thus abu hassan tells the edge, as things stand, we do not need to undertake a rights issue or a private placement for this project. of course, if something happens and we need to raise funds we will. however, it is interesting that prestariang will not be cutting back on dividend payouts. abu hassan insists that the group will maintain its 50% dividend payout policy. assuming the group manages to book the 11 sen to 17 sen earnings per share that analysts forecast, that works out to a payout between rm26.5 million and rm41 million a year. thats a pretty sizable cash flow drain. keep in mind that the skin concession has zero cash flow in the first three years. the government only begins to make payments from 2021 onwards. in fact, some analysts are a little more sceptical. aminvestment banks report prices in a potential dilution of 18.6% or 90 million new shares issued at rm2 apiece to finance the project. aminvestment actually downgraded its call on prestariang to hold with a target price of rm2. previously, it had made a buy call with a target price of rm2.60. this makes aminvestments call the most conservative on prestariang. the good news is that the project should have minimal operational risk. unlike highway concessions for example, which have uncertainty over traffic projections, skins revenue projections should be fairly accurate. this would allow the group to borrow at competitive rates. the flipside of course, is that there is minimal earnings upside. right now, the concession includes a provision for us to resize the project at regular intervals, and this has already been priced in. this ensures the system is always able to cope with fluctuations in [immigration] volumes, explains abu hassan. the only way the rm3.5 billion figure can increase is if the scope of the project grows due to the government adding new border entry points in the future, he explains.  educloud gets a mixed response anyone who had the opportunity to sit in on the presentation by abu hassan and his team last week would notice immediately that more than half of the slides were dedicated to prestariangs transformation. key to this transformation, will be educloud  a shared cloud services provider targeted at local educational institutions. in simple terms, educloud will enable malaysian universities to migrate their products, services and data to the cloud. this could range from administrative areas like student enrolment to the education side of the business, like study materials and lectures. in the long run however, educlouds vision is to introduce standardised student ids that the group hopes to monetise through other means like e-commerce or ride-sharing services. thus far, prestariang claims it has no trouble soliciting interest from the universities. our problem isnt getting interest. our problem now is making sure we can deliver. the universities see the value in what we are proposing. it can save them millions in costs, explains farad alhusaini, the cloud system orchestrator for prestariang digital sdn bhd. clearly, educloud is on a completely different tack from prestariangs other businesses. not surprisingly, there are some sceptics. it sounds great, but the immediate worry is whether educloud will be a drag on earnings. how quickly will it start turning a profit? one fund manager asks. he points to prestariangs education venture, unimy, which has been a drag on the groups earnings. the good thing about the shared cloud services however, is the fact that it does not require massive capex. we will rely on our partners to build the cloud storage for us  alibaba and amazon web services. we are more like brokers, explains farad. on a positive note, this simply means educloud could achieve scale very quickly. if anything, educloud has the most potential to surprise on the upside going forward. but just like skin, this will be new territory for prestariang and investors will be watching closely to see how well the group can execute such projects.

[we] upgrade [the stock] to buy as we believe the companys near-term earnings will stabilise. bfood currently offers a potential capital upside of 11%, he says in a june 15 note. wong has a target price of rm1.70 for the stock. cimb research analyst kristine wong, who downgraded bfood to reduce, believes that the stocks valuation is rich. she has a target price of rm1.38 for the counter. significant recovery in consumer spending is a key upside risk to our call, she says in a june 14 report, when bfood was trading at rm1.53 per share. even though bfoods earnings came in below expectations [in fy2017], we expect its performance to improve in fy2018 as krr losses narrow [with the closure of non-profitable outlets] and starbucks continues to expand. while some analysts suggest that disposing of krr could be a re-rating catalyst for bfood, an industry source who is close to the higher echelons of the group, says there is no immediate plan to do that. they are left with about 80 krr stores in the country, and all of them are making money. the only problem is [the] indonesia [business], but they are fixing it. from what i understand, there is no plan for a disposal now, he says. as for starbucks, they are trying to maintain the expansion at 30 outlets a year. it is still a growth story because of the branding, and its halal. people can drink up to four times a day; it is like a recurring business, unlike tim ho wan or krr. that kind of business is very competitive; people usually go there only once or twice a week.

also, mahb delivered a healthy 11.2% year-on-year (y-o-y) traffic growth in malaysia during the first six months of financial year 2017, the highest in three years, while its international traffic growth at istanbul sabiha gokcen international airport rose back to positive territory. in our view, the current share price now substantially reflects all of the above, plus: i) the expected passenger service charge (psc) hike at klia2 come jan 1, 2018; and ii) an implicit 30% rise in landing charges, also from jan 1 next year. in the near term, several factors may temper the share price momentum. mahb renegotiated its staff collective bargaining agreement in the second quarter of fy17 (2qfy17), and the salary increment was backdated to jan 1, 2017 and would be booked entirely in 2q. also, the warranty period for klia2 expired at end-april 2017 and repair costs beyond that date will be borne by mahb. cost inflation may eat away some of the revenue gains from strong traffic growth. on the revenue side, double-digit traffic growth in malaysia began from september 2016. hence, y-o-y growth rates may slow from 3qfy17 and into fy18. as airlines load factors are now close to 90%, further volume growth will be more difficult without more aircraft. although both airasia and malindo are adding new planes, malaysia airlines is planning to cut its 737-800 fleet by six units to 48 planes by end-2017, while its 494-seat a380s will be removed from service by may 2018 and replaced by smaller 287-seat a350s to london. while the malaysian concession has been extended, the terms of the extension have not yet been negotiated with the government. interestingly, mahb wants to improve the terms of the current concession as well, particularly in relation to the user fee, which is the share of revenue that mahb pays to the government. mahb also wants to secure the right to tax passengers to fund future airport development capital expenditure. if mahb gets even part of what it is asking for, it will be very positive for the stocks valuation. when mahb successfully negotiated the terms of the current operating agreement (oa) in 2009, it only had to deal with the finance ministry (mof) but, today, the malaysian aviation commission (mavcom) has been set up as an independent regulatory body with powers to determine landing charges and psc rates, overriding the oas

[retail] investors just dont want to put their money in the stock market or in property because the returns are not exciting anymore, [which is] why money games and get-rich-quick schemes have proliferated in recent years, said the investment banker. he is of the view that the ipo of lct may have seen a higher take-up rate among retail participants if a higher number of shares had been issued at a lower price. kaf investment bank bhd corporate finance director michael ho said that although the liquidity of retail investors is a concern, regulators have engaged market participants to ensure that due diligence practice is being conducted on corporate transactions in order to garner investors confidence. according to ho, the investment bank has seen many enquiries from small companies and smes and maintains a positive outlook on the ipo market this year. however, he highlighted that the dynamism of todays market that companies which are viable for listing today may not be so viable tomorrow requires the bank to continuously monitor the performance of their businesses. malaysia is definitely an attractive market [in the region].were almost on par with london and as good as many other developed markets in terms of market-entry requirements, corporate governance, market surveillance and other areas, ho said, adding that listing costs and valuations are also competitive. however, one head of research decried the valuations that companies listing on bursa have been seeing in recent times. years ago, valuations were made based on the [listing] companys fundamentals, with a price-earnings ratio of four to five times at most. these days, offers are being priced at whatever price investment bankers can get away with, he said.\n"}, "105": {"date_posted": "20/7/2017", "title": "bursa malaysia closes lower on profit-taking", "article": " kuala lumpur (july 20): malaysian stocks closed slightly lower today, as investors turned to profit-taking after early gains fuelled by global shares extended run of record highs. the benchmark fbm klci closed down 0.09% or 1.64 points to 1,755.63 today, dragged down by ajinomoto (malaysia) bhd, dutch lady milk industries bhd and panasonic manufacturing malaysia bhd. turnover was 1.72 billion shares valued at rm2.01 billion. there were 373 gainers, 465 losers and 381 counters that traded unchanged. british american tobacco (malaysia) bhd, allianz malaysia bhd and genting bhd were the top gainers. the most actively traded stocks were frontken corp bhd, mlabs systems bhd, and managepay systems bhd. according to etiqa takaful and insurance head of research chris eng, investors take profits in blue chip stocks after the market's recent ascent. he said investors also reacted to yesterday's news about state-owned investment firm khazanah nasional bhd looking to sell a block of shares in cimb group holdings bhd for rm571 million to rm581 million. the banking counter saw a placement of up to 90.52 million shares by khazanah, which owns 29.1% of cimb, for rm571.18 million, or rm6.31 per share, in off-market trades today. noting that the banking counter had risen ahead of the placement yesterday, eng said the stock is unlikely to rebound to its recent two-year high any time soon. cimb shares closed down 11 sen or 1.71% at rm6.31 today, with 21.32 million shares done, bringing it a market capitalisation of rm57.21 billion. across asia, shares rose to new heights in tandem with a stronger global market, according to reuters. msci's broadest index of asia-pacific shares outside japan rose 0.1%, hovering near its highest level since december 2007, the newswire reported. the shanghai composite advanced 0.4% while hong kong's hang seng crept up 0.3%. in japan, a weaker yen helped to lift the nikkei by 0.6%, as south korea's kospi rose for the sixth straight session to hit an all-time high of 2,441.84 points.

respectable 50 years old on aug 8, is a paradox of the possibilities of regional cooperation on the one hand, and a prime example of unfulfilled potential on the other. to draw attention to the urgency of prioritising the creation of an integrated asean entity, beginning with the asean economic community (aec), an [emailprotected] conference to be held on aug 4 in kuala lumpur will put the spotlight on the considerable hurdles that stand in the way of that ambition being realised. speaking at a media briefing to announce the event last week, asean business advisory council malaysia chairman tan sri mohd munir majid highlighted several key difficulties that are preventing the regional grouping from getting its act together. asean, said munir, needs to become more dynamic and realistic in a global environment that is getting ever more challenging and is being transformed by rapidly changing technology. pinpointing the consensual manner in which its decisions are made, which munir said needs overhauling, the conference seeks to address two burning questions: whether asean can unlock its undeniable potential; and whether its aspirations of deeper regional economic integration can be reached. indeed, the double-edged nature of the asean way  as the spirit of consensus that guides the groupings decision-making mechanisms is called  is well-recognised as a key factor in aseans durability as well as its ineffectiveness as a means of addressing pressing challenges. to discuss the first question, which concerns the role that asean can play in shaping the future of its 630 million people, a diverse trans-regional panel will navigate the issues that prevent the regional organisation from making the robust moves that will ensure its optimal progress. the second panel will discuss the prospects of the aec, which was launched in 2015 with the vision of southeast asia as a single market and production base with the free flow of goods, services and investments. however, without a common regulatory framework and with trade costs and non-tariff measures increasing rather than decreasing since then, can asean achieve its economic promise, munir asked. while the difficulties that confront asean are becoming increasingly in need of critical attention, with disruptive global trends sweeping through industries and economic sectors, its members have so far not been able to surmount their nationalistic instincts. among the notable voices on this issue is that of cimb group chairman datuk seri nazir razak, who identified in a speech made in march last year the key shifts that asean must make to achieve the vision for the aec: the elephant in the room as it were, is the tension between the established so-called asean way and the real necessities of economic integration. economic integration simply necessitates concessions to national sovereignty, including an empowered supranational body to not only drive integration initiatives, but also enforce commitments to it. asean governments must accept the need to make decisions in the wider interest of the aec, and must not pander to vested interest disguised as nationalism. vietnams president tran dai quang made a similar point about territorial issues in august last year at a lecture in singapore, when asked about aseans difficulties in arriving at a consensus position on the recent escalation of the south china sea dispute: we all know that the principle of consensus is enshrined in the asean charter u2026 but given the new developments, we may consider and supplement the principle (of consensus) with other mechanisms. it may be useful at the point of aseans golden jubilee to recall that a major driver for the formation of the regional grouping in 1967 was the threat of expansionary communist influence coupled with insurgencies within several southeast asian nations. as the founding fathers of asean came together for their mutual security, the obvious economic, social and political advantages of establishing a regional grouping would have become clear to them  and so, the vision of regional cooperation was born. in the current period, too, the external pressures generated by shifting geopolitical forces, as well as the economic challenges posed by disruptive global developments, ought to provide sufficient impetus for asean governments to look beyond their national preoccupations to respond to emerging threats in asia-pacific and beyond. clearly, much like individual players in a team sport have to develop a common purpose and strategy if they are going to compete successfully against their opponents, asean at 50 needs to wholeheartedly embrace a spirit of regionalism in order to meet the challenges from other giant economies. admittedly, this is no easy undertaking given that its 10 member states are at vastly different stages of development, and are naturally divided by language, culture, religion, geography and political situation. but perhaps, as kishore mahbubani and jeffery sng write in the asean miracle: a catalyst for peace, a nobel prize forasean is long overdue for bringing peace to a region that has endured great conflicts. the authors attribute aseans success to three factors: the asean way, which prevents a hardening of positions that come from a policy of isolation; networking, both intra-regionally and globally; and non-intervention in one anothers domestic affairs. while these achievements are certainly not trifling, the horrors that they permit must not be understated. in any case, as the authors acknowledge, asean must take stock of the geopolitical and economic challenges that are shaking up the world and this region and take effective steps to remain relevant. so if asean expects to become a force to be reckoned with when it becomes the fourth largest economy by 2030, it needs to honestly assess whether that position is compatible with the unhurried pace that it has taken until now. for the people of asean, the outcome of that process could determine whether their region will flourish as an integrated economic powerhouse or be caught up in the geopolitical game that is unfolding in this century. r b bhattacharjee is associate editor at the edge malaysia."}, "107": {"date_posted": "20/7/2017", "title": "cimb down after rising on thailand unit profit rise", "article":

concession agreement with the government for skin, based on a build, operate, maintain and transfer method. the announcement of prestariangs 70% stake in the project  as opposed to full ownership  took aminvestment bank bhd by surprise, resulting in a downgrade to its buy call on the stock to hold, with a lower fair value of rm2 per share. aminvestment bank analyst lavis chong said that the research house had also factored in a potential share dilution in its downgrade, in the event prestariang carries out an equity-raising exercise to fund the project. noting that prestariang is considering an 80:20 debt-to-equity ratio as the funding structure for skin, aminvestment estimated that the project would require a capital expenditure of rm900 million. this means the group may have to raise rm180 million in equity. assuming rm2 as the offer price for its equity-raising exercise, there would be a potential dilution from the issuance of 90 million new shares. all in, the reduction in project ownership from 100% to 70%, coupled with the potential dilution from new share issuance, has contributed largely to our reduction in fair value, he added. while cimb investment bank bhd analyst nigel foo said the skin development was positive for the company, he too pointed out that the reduced effective stake was a negative surprise to the research firm. the remaining 30% of skin will be owned by the three founders and brains of the skin project, it said, who are still working for the skin project. prestariangs effective stake in skin could fall further if the company sells a direct stake in skin. however, prestariang has indicated it would ultimately own more than a 60% stake in skin, wrote foo in a note yesterday. nevertheless, he said the project could potentially offer higher-than-expected construction and concession earnings compared with the research houses previous forecast. this is due to potential cost savings as the government wants a major part of the project to be done locally, instead of in france by prestariangs main technology partner, thales communications & security sas, he said. this could result in a higher-than-expected irr (internal rate of

lotte chemical titan holding bhds (lct) initial public offering, it is still the largest ipo on bursa malaysia in five years. but the downward revision has triggered discussions on whether the issuer and its advisers had been overly optimistic in their valuations or whether it was a matter of poor timing. the initial target of the ipo was to raise up to rm5.9 billion. that is large, and it was obvious from the start that foreign investor participation was needed, according to an investment banker familiar with the deal. from the roadshows and book-building exercise, there was enough demand from foreign institutional investors but most were multi-strategy or hedge funds. to ensure a good after-market performance, and to ensure the stock continues to perform post-listing, additional long-term investors were needed, he says. the commitment from cornerstone investors such as permodalan nasional bhd and eastspring investments bhd gave lct the confidence to set the offer price at rm8 per share. other committed backers included great eastern life assurance (m) bhd, maybank asset management sdn bhd and maybank islamic asset management sdn bhd. however, last monday, lct announced that it was reducing its ipo size by 21.7% from 740.483 million shares to 580 million shares. it revised the offer price to rm6.50 per share a day later, putting the amount raised at some rm3.77 billion. last tuesday, malaysian issuing house sdn bhd (mih) disclosed that lcts retail offering of 55.78 million shares saw a take-up rate of 61.87% or 34.51 million shares. the unsubscribed retail offering of 21.27 million shares, which were underwritten by the joint underwriters, were reallocated to the institutional offering. mih said the institutional offering of 524.22 million shares were fully taken up. yes, the deal did encounter some speed bumps but the point is, it got done and the issuer raised almost rm4 billion. that is not an easy feat, the investment banker says. the deal size was reduced probably to ensure a successful transaction, which turned out to be the right decision by the company. on hindsight, yes, the institutional investors could have taken up everything but it would have been risky and the deal may not close, he explains, adding that the petrochemical business may not be well understood by international investors that have other investment options in the region. as for timing, the ipo market is just beginning to see a revival of sorts with 10 companies  including lct  going for listing, raising up to rm7.14 billion. last year, some rm825.27 million was raised from ipos on bursa malaysia  barely 18.97% of the sum raised in 2015. according to bursa, the ipo market raised rm4.35 billion in 2015 and rm3.94 billion in 2014. there were 12 ipos in 2016 and 13 in 2015. while certain quarters in the capital market say the downsizing of lcts ipo was because the issuer and advisers had been overly ambitious  with some even saying the ipo adviser had misread the market  kaf investment funds bhd chief investment officer gan kong yik has a different perspective. it was not really a misjudgement. they were pretty bullish on the market when they priced it at rm8 per share, but we have to give it to the management for being open-minded enough to revise the deal to suit the market appetite, he says. maybank investment bank bhd was the ipos principal adviser, joint global coordinator, joint book runner, and managing and joint underwriter. credit suisse and j p morgan acted as joint global coordinators and joint book runners. nomura and hsbc were the joint book runners while cimb investment bank bhd was a joint book runner and underwriter. affin hwang investment bank bhd and midf amanah investment bank bhd were the joint underwriters. in fact, it is very professional to do it this way. the management can choose not to do anything. and sometimes, it is very hard to gauge what is the best price u2026 especially in the retail segment. retail investors dont look at valuation so much  they look more at the absolute value, gan explains. a broker, who prefers anonymity, agrees with gan and says his retail clients were reluctant to subscribe for lct shares mainly because of the high absolute price. with rm6.50, they have many other choices. rm8 [per share] cannot sell in this market, regardless of the pe (price-earnings ratio). investors generally still look at the absolute price, he says. also, raising capital in this market is not easy because the risk is still high in malaysia, especially with the 14th general election around the corner, he adds. while there are mixed views on the revision, a fund manager, who declines to be named, says the revised offer price of rm6.50 per share has made the ipo more appealing and foresees a potential 10% upside upon listing. although this is a long-term counter, to get 10% return at rm8 per share is a bit difficult but rm6.50 would be easier. lets see what happens on tuesday, he says.

fourth-largest listed drug producer by market capitalisation. ysp sah has an extensive range of largely own-brand products that includes generic medical drugs, over-the-counter (otc) items, aquatic

indonesia and vietnam. currently, generics comprise 60% of total drugs sold in malaysia (versus >75% of drug sales in the us and uk), of which 30% are produced locally and 70% imported. we believe sales of generics will continue rising in tandem with more product offerings, as users switch to generics for cost reasons. this will also be spurred by the private healthcare spending that is growing at a faster rate than government healthcare spending. ysp sah is set to benefit from this trend as sales to private gps/hospitals made up 50% of its fy16 sales. the company expects rising contributions from exports to be its key earnings driver moving forward. its key growth markets are in asean, mainly countries with large populations and low penetration rates. ysp sah aims to continue registering more products in each market and increase competitiveness via a wider range of product offerings. margins should improve from better economies of scale as production increases.

efficiency and a more profitable product mix (otc, tcm and veterinary drugs). we project ysp sahs three-year eps cagr (fy16-19f) at 16.9%, driven by: i) rising export sales, ii) higher demand for generics in the local market, and iii) a turnaround in vietnam operations. in our sop, the pharmaceutical business is valued at 14.2 times cy18f per (at a 20% discount to cimbs pharmaceutical sectors

(see: thaibev 1h earnings fall 1.8% to $580 mil) a recent grumble we have been hearing is whether the latest excise tax will result in weaker volumes. note that the magnitude and exact details of the new excise tax have yet to be announced, he continues. nonetheless, our analysis of tax hikes on thaibevs sales volumes over the last decade shows that tax hikes do not necessarily result in a drop in volumes. even if they do, volume declines are never sustained over a prolonged period and volumes eventually recover.  instead, the analyst believes the excise hike could have a silver lining in the form of improved margins for the group, based on the observation that thaibev typically tries to take advantage of any excise hikes and raise average selling prices (asps) beyond the hike. cimbs current assumptions are hence for the spirits segments gross margins to remain flat in fy17f, which it thinks should be easily achieved. following a recent discussion with the management of fraser and neave (f&n), the analyst also expects f&n to be the vehicle for thaibevs regional expansion plans moving forward. a key takeaway [from our meeting] was that f&n confirmed our view that thaibev will use f&n to grow the non-thai business. we like the regional expansion story and expect f&n to be among the bidders for sabeco, and to also gradually increase its vinamilk stake (now at 18.74%), says seow. we believe the stock could re-rate further from corporate actions, including the finalisation of f&n/frasers centrepoints corporate restructuring, and mergers and acquisitions (m&as) in vietnam. in its home market, market share gains in beer could also drive the share price, he adds. as at 12.15pm, shares of thaibev are trading 0.55% higher at 92 singapore cents.

malaysia are probably heaving a sigh of relief as the benchmark fbm klci has gained 8.2% year to date while the ftse bursa malaysia small cap index has surged 17.1%. this is after two to three years of lacklustre performance. the good news for those who stuck to the construction and infrastructure theme is that the bursa malaysia construction index has gained 18.5% year to date. chris eng, head of research with etiqa insurance & takaful, opines that the construction sector is still the top pick. we remain positive about the construction sector. revenue and earnings contribution from ongoing jobs will kick in this year, he says. engs comments are reflective of most of the narrative of investment strategies in malaysia. affin hwang investment bank bhd, in a june 5 report titled malaysia strategy, says the earnings of construction and infrastructure players are expected to improve in the subsequent quarters as progress billings accelerate on existing projects, new contracts are secured and property sales pick up. according to the research house, the construction and infrastructures headline net profit jumped 98.6% year on year mainly due to one-off gains or the absence of one-off losses at ijm corp bhd, wct holdings bhd and gabungan aqrs bhd. the better operating profit of most of the construction companies covered by us also contributed to the good results. the record-high order books of most companies and acceleration in progress billings spurred year-on-year earnings growth. most construction companies also saw better profit margins due to rising revenue while cost pressure was contained. it says. besides expecting higher earnings for construction players this year, cimb equity research also highlights in its june 1 strategy report that these companies will benefit from newsflow and new jobs at major infrastructure projects, such as the rm28 billion mrt2. jp morgan asia pacific equity research, too, is optimistic that the construction sector will outperform the benchmark index. its analyst mak hoy kit says in his report that more than rm241 billion of rail-related investments will help drive the construction sectors growth. he also notes that with a more stable and higher oil price, there is more fiscal flexibility for the government. another foreign research house, nomura, shares the sentiment because construction players showed improved margins in their first-quarter results. while the research house is underweight on malaysian equities, it is positive about tourism and transport-related names and commodity plays in asia ex-japan. we expect pure-play construction companies to continue to outperform stocks that have diversified into property. thus, sunway construction group bhd remains our top pick in the malaysian construction space, says nomura analyst tushar mohata in his june 5 report. on the progress of the kl-singapore high-speed rail, cimb equity research says tenders for its asset company, assetsco, will be called in the fourth quarter of this year. as the pre-tender phase of assetsco kicks off, myhsr and singapores land transport authority (lta) will jointly conduct an industry briefing in singapore on july 5. the assetsco that is appointed will be responsible for supplying, making available and maintaining the hsr trains and associated systems, such as track, power, signalling and telecommunications, and will function as a network operator. according to myhsr, the governments of japan, south korea and china are strongly lobbying for a major role in the hsr project. we see each of these governments forming consortiums ahead of the tender. we gather that having a local partner in a consortium is not required, although this will be decided upon by myhsr and lta later. for now, it appears that a local partner in assetsco may have little role to play as most local companies or contractors have limited experience in hsr assets and operations, says cimb equity researchs sharizan rosely in a june 21 report. the research house is optimistic of an improvement in the progress of the kl-singapore hsr project in the second half of the year but believes it is too early to name the winners of the project. within its coverage, gamuda bhd remains the top pick for the rail theme while muhibbah engineering (m) bhd is its preferred small and mid cap.  backed by consistent spending dbs group research analyst chong tjen-san writes in his report that malaysias construction sector is backed by consistent spending. according to him, construction spending as a percentage of gross domestic product has been trending upwards and stood at 4.9% last year. he adds that while the percentage is relatively low, the multiplier effect on the economy is huge. the research house believes that transport-related infrastructure, such as mass rapid transit (mrt), light rail transit (lrt), the pan-borneo highway, east coast railway link and eventually the hsr, will be of utmost importance to the economy and will see negligible risk of delays or cuts in spending. midf is upbeat about the construction sector but cautious about stock valuations. despite the research houses bullish view of the construction sector, its analyst, fadhli dzulkifly, tells the edge that the sector would not be able to maintain its current dizzying 23.5 times price-earnings ratio (per). he says this should normalise to 17.5 times per or about 1.1 times book value, thus becoming more appealing to value hunters. he says while midf likes the sector, he favours construction companies with strong core competences and a diversified non-commodity revenue stream. despite a change in our recommendation due to share price movements, we see bright prospects for muhibbah engineering, malaysian resources corp bhd and gabungan aqrs due to their forte in construction backed by a revenue stream from airport concessions, facility management and state-specific property developments. according to fadhli, the long list of potential infrastructure projects under the national development plan reiterates the governments commitment to boost rural and urban connectivity. he says the ndp will be the cavalry that consolidates and integrates the sector.

target price (tp) of rm2.70: cypark resources bhds second quarter ended april 30, 2017 (2qfy17) core net profit fell 27% year-on-year (y-o-y) due mainly to the recognition of rm5.2 million employee share option scheme (esos) expense in the quarter. excluding this, cyparks operating profit rose 7% y-o-y in 2qfy17 to rm23 million, driven mainly by environmental engineering (ee) performance. its ee operating profit rose 27% y-o-y to rm15 million in the quarter. this more than offset the marginally weaker performance of all other divisions and lifted the groups overall operating profit. cypark issued 23.1 million esos options to its directors and employees at rm2.12 per share, which resulted in rm5.2 million of non-cash expense being recognised in 2qfy17. based on cyparks existing esos that runs from october 2015 to october 2020, the company is allowed to issue up to 15% of its initial paid-up capital. the 23.1 million esos options issued represent about 9% of the initial paid-up capital. while the esos issuance is negative for cyparks earnings, we are positively surprised that its ee divisions external revenue registered a 37% growth in the first half of fy17 (1hfy17) and a 28% growth in 2qfy17. ee is the division that provides environment-related services, such as landfill closure and wastewater treatment. it is also the key earnings contributor for cypark among its non-renewable energy (re) businesses. in the financial year ended oct 31, 2016 (fy16), ee contributed 87% of cyparks non-re pre-tax profit. the increase in the ee divisions external revenue eased concerns that cyparks ee earnings may drop drastically when it completes a key internal project  cyparks waste-to-energy (wte) plant in negeri sembilan. cyparks ee division is a key contractor of the wte plant that is scheduled to be completed by year end, and the ee division has been recognising construction profits related to the development of the wte plant. based on our estimates, approximately 80% of cyparks ee pre-tax profit in fy16 was generated from internal projects. this is one of the key reasons we value cyparks non-re division at only six times calendar year 2018 price-earnings ratio, a 50% discount to the construction sectors average. the strong growth in external revenue suggests that cypark has been able to win and redeploy its capacity for external jobs. as such, we raise our target multiple for its non-re division to nine times, now based on a 25% discount to the construction sectors average. we continue to value cyparks non-re division at a discount to its peers to mainly reflect its small size. the higher valuation of the division raises our sum-of-parts-based tp to rm2.70. still, we downgrade the stock to hold as its share price is up 38% year to date. we believe this has fully reflected its long-term earnings growth potential. key upside/downside risks to our call include better-/weaker-than-expected earnings from its ee division and the wte plant in fy18.  cimb research, july 2"}, "124": {"date_posted": "29/6/2017", "title": "umwog's proposed cash call critical to prevent liquidity crisis, says cimb research", "article": " kuala

as we work to deliver oil to our clients, enquest plc and cairn energy plc, and work towards receiving the charter income for bumi armada, said bumi armada chief executive officer leon harland in a

happen only after all of bumi armadas assets are producing and only in conjunction with other options, such as private placements and asset sales, which would reduce the impact of a dilutive rights

status. a merger of the two would create the countrys second-largest stand-alone islamic bank with total assets of rm47.81 billion, after bank islam malaysia bhd. in a stock exchange filing yesterday evening, mbsb said it had submitted the application within the stipulated six-month time frame to seek the approvals of bank negara and/or the finance ministry. further announcements would be made upon receipt of bnms decision, it added. the edge malaysia weekly, in its june 12 issue, cited sources as saying that the proposed plan involves mbsb buying afbs assets and liabilities in a deal that values the latter at a price-to-book value (pbv) of between 1.2 times and 1.5 times. it is understood that just two of afbs four middle east shareholders  qatar islamic bank (66.67%) and financial assets bahrain wll (6.67%)  plan to exit, while the other two, rusd investment bank inc (16.67%) and tadhamon international islamic bank (10%) want to stay on in the enlarged banking entity. as such, it is expected to be a deal that involves both cash and shares, with shares going to the shareholders that want to stay. the total consideration for the deal is about rm650 million, with more than half of that comprising a cash portion, a source told the edge financial daily. it is understood that the cash portion values afb at the lower end of the pbv range. there is a likelihood that qatar islamic bank may not exit completely, with a source saying that it may end up with just a small stake in the enlarged banking group. bnm on dec 21 last year gave the green light for mbsb, which is 60%-owned by the employees provident fund (epf), and afb to hold merger talks. it allowed them six months, up to tomorrow, to complete negotiations. mbsb has long wanted to be a full-fledged islamic bank; buying afb enables it to clinch the latters islamic banking licence. this is, in fact, mbsbs third attempt in less than three years to get an islamic banking licence by acquiring an islamic bank. in february 2016, it attempted a merger with bank muamalat malaysia bhd. and before that, it was to have merged with the islamic banking units of cimb group holdings bhd and rhb bank bhd, but the plan fell through in january 2015. while the expansion of profits and assets is likely to be immaterial, the proposed merger will benefit mbsb in another way. the full bank licence will allow mbsb to be able to tap into new financial services segments which it cannot offer at the moment (such as trade facilities, collecting current account and savings account deposits, and offering other interbank instruments) to expand the business, midf research said in a report late last year. mbsb has already been preparing to be a full-fledged bank. its profits, which used to be at record levels annually, took a hit after it started a three-year loan impairment programme in the final quarter of 2014. the move to raise its provisions was to streamline its operations to be more in line with banking standards and best practices. it reported a strong net profit of rm101.32 million for the first quarter of this year, up nearly 200% from a year ago, due to higher gross loans and lower cost of funds. interestingly, this is the second ongoing proposed banking merger that involves the epf. late last month, ammb holdings bhd and rhb bank bhd, in which the epf is a common shareholder, got the central banks approval to start merger talks."}, "129": {"date_posted": "19/6/2017", "title": "newsbreak: kwap could get big stake in merged rhb-ammb ", "article": " kumpulan wang persaraan (kwap), the countrys second largest pension fund, is expected to emerge as a substantial shareholder in the proposed rhb bank bhd-ammb holdings bhd merged entity, sources say. it could end up holding up to a 10% stake in the enlarged entity, they say. according to a source, post-merger, kwap is likely to acquire the bulk of the portion of australia and new zealand banking group ltds (anz) underwritten shares in the enlarged entity. the likelihood is that the institutional investor will come in, post-merger, to take up a portion of the anz block, the source tells the edge. kwap already has a 1.76% stake in ammb, and a 3.94% stake in rhb, bloomberg data shows. post-merger, anz is expected to have just over 10% of the enlarged banking group.if kwap were to come in and take a portion of it, this would resolve one of the tricky issues in the proposed rhb-ammb merger: how anz  which has been looking to sell its 23.78% stake in ammb  will exit, given that the merger is to be effected via an all-share deal. rhb group managing director and ceo datuk khairussaleh ramli had told analysts that rhb would be acquiring ammbs assets and liabilities in an all-share deal, and he hoped to do the deal at one-time book value. he stressed that there would be no cash involved. i wouldnt be surprised if a government-linked investment company came in u2026 because if anz doesnt have a way to sell its shares, i dont see how a merger can happen, says an industry observer. anz is the single largest shareholder in ammb. analysts had previously pointed out that as both rhb and ammb are trading just under one-time book value and a share deal is done at book value, anz and other shareholders could exit at a later date. the employees provident fund is a common shareholder in rhb (40.7% stake) and ammb (9.5%). rhbs other major shareholders are aabar investments pjs (17.75%) and osk groups tan sri ong leong huat (10.13%). aabars stake is now parked under mubadala investment co. over at ammb, founder and chairman tan sri azman hashim , who is stepping down from all roles in the group within two years, has a 12.97% stake. assuming the share swap is done at book value for both banks, the shareholding structure post-merger is likely to be epf with 27.9%, mubadala and anz with 10.2% each, osk with 5.8%, and azman, 5.6%. maybank investment bank research, in a june 2 report, says there is the risk of a potential share overhang should the major shareholders choose to exit. it notes that the combined shareholding of aabar, osk, anz and azman works out to be about 31.5% post-merger and that it would be a positive if a strategic shareholder could be identified to take up this block. industry observers point out that kwap is the only government-linked investment company that does not yet have a major stake in a local banking group, which is why it is the most likely to emerge in the merged rhb-ammb entity. kwaps fund size stood at rm125 billion in december 2016. permodalan nasional bhd is already a major shareholder in malayan banking bhd, while khazanah nasional bhd is in cimb group holdings bhd, the armed forced fund board, or ltat, is in affin holdings bhd, and lembaga tabung haji, in bimb holdings bhd. kwap only has small stakes in several local banks. it has 3.12% equity interest in maybank, 5.24% in cimb group, 1.1% in public bank, 0.57% in hong leong bank bhd and 0.81% in alliance financial group bhd. maybank research estimates anzs holding cost in ammb to be about rm5.31 per share currently, about equivalent to ammbs march 2017 book value of rm5.32 per share. anz first bought into ammb in 2006, paying an average of rm3.63 a share for the stake over two tranches, or rm2.58 billion in total. this works out to a p/bv of 1.96 times, in line with mergers and acquisitions norms of about 1.9 times for malaysian banks at the time. anz had a carrying value of a$1.2 billion, or about rm3.9 billion, on the ammb stake, according to its financial results for fy2016. it made a massive impairment charge of a$260 million for the local lender in 1hfy2016. the carrying value of rm3.9 billion translates into a p/bv of 1.06 times, which is close to what ammbs stock is currently trading at of 0.94 times book.

", "article": " a key issue that arises from the proposed merger between rhb bank bhd and ammb holdings bhd is whether their common major shareholder, the employees provident fund (epf), will have voting rights in the deal. we need to understand the structure of the scheme to see our voting entitlements. we have to wait for that, the epfs ceo datuk shahril ridzuan tells the edge when asked about it. recall that this issue was a major stumbling block in the proposed banking mega merger of rhb, cimb group holdings bhd and malaysia building society bhd (mbsb) about 2u00bd years ago. bursa malaysias listing rules did not allow it to vote on the deal as it owned major stakes in all three entities. the epf, through two of the banks, applied for a waiver from the rules but bursa stood firm, even after an appeal was made on the matter. at that time, the epf was the single largest shareholder in rhb and mbsb with a 41.5% and 64.6% stake respectively, and held a 14.6% stake in cimb. bursa, in explaining its rejection, pointed out that the epfs position was not the same as the other shareholders in the companies. it said its controlling stakes in the two companies put it in a position of significant influence. it also believed the epf had prior knowledge of the proposed merger. the epf vote at that time was seen to be a crucial deciding factor on whether the cimb-rhb-mbsb merger would go through. the merger was later called off in early 2015 as the parties felt a worsening economic outlook no longer made it compelling. in the rhb-ammb case, the epf currently holds a 40.7% stake in rhb and 9.84% in ammb. interestingly, the epf has pared down its stake in ammb. in late march, it held 11.68.% and at end-2016, 14.94%. as a big shareholder in both banks, it raises the question as to whether it will be able to vote on the deals. bursas listing requirements, chapter 10.08(7), in a nutshell, states that in a meeting to obtain shareholder approval, a related party with any interest  direct or indirect  must not vote on the resolution in respect of a related party transaction (rpt). however, there are exceptions to a transaction being deemed an rpt, including if the major shareholder is a statutory institution who manages funds belonging to the general public. but, this is not so clear cut as there are also other considerations, depending on the case. it is understood that when this deal  which is now being worked out  comes to a vote, rhb, as the acquirer of ammbs assets and liabilities, would need 50%-plus-one-share approval from shareholders for it to go through. ammb, meanwhile, would require 75% shareholder approval in a special resolution vote. in rhbs analyst briefing last thursday, when asked whether key shareholders would be permitted to vote on both banks sides, its group managing director and ceo datuk khairussaleh ramli responded: this is something we have to analyse and engage with relevant authorities, including bursa, to check who would be able to vote. apart from the epf, rhbs other major shareholders are aabar investments pjs (17.75%) and osk groups tan sri ong leong huat (10.13%). aabars 17.75% stake in rhb is now parked under mubadala investment co  a bigger sovereign fund from abu dhabi. a key point to note is whether the epf ... is able to seek a waiver from regulators to allow them to vote in this deal. under the current ruling, they will not be allowed to vote as they own stakes in both rhb and ammb which raises the issue of conflict of interest. assuming the epf is not able to vote [at rhb] and that aabar may vote against the deal, it is crucial that the deal gets the support of osk and permodalan nasional bhd s funds, which on a combined basis would have an effective 39.6% stake in rhb  excluding the epf from the shareholders voting base. in such a scenario, the deal would require only 30% of the remaining minority shareholder to vote in favour to achieve a simple majority, uob kay hian research says in a june 2 report. over at ammb, its largest shareholder australia and new zealand banking group ltd (anz) wants to exit and has been looking to sell its 23.78% stake. anz had said last november that it planned to sell its stake over the next 12 to 18 month. ammbs next biggest shareholder is its founder and chairman tan sri azman hashim, who holds a substantial stake of 12.97%. he is retiring from all his positions within the group over the next two years, and hence, likely to be more open to paring down his stake.  all-share deal, asset and liability route the edge financial daily reported on june 2 that rhb and ammbs merger plan involves rhb buying all of the latters assets and liabilities in an all-share deal. rhb told analysts last thursday that it hoped to do the deal at one-time book value (bv). khairussaleh stressed that there would be no cash involved, the daily also learnt. this raises questions as to how anz would exit, if there is no cash. khairussaleh said that this was the right time for the two banks to go into a merger, particularly because both are trading at close to their bvs. so, if we can do it at book, that will be great. we minimise goodwill to optimise the financial outcome, he said. rhb was trading at a price to bv of 0.97 times prior to the merger u00adannouncement, while ammb was trading at 0.98 times. an industry observer points out that as both banks are trading just under one-time book value now and a share deal happens at book value, anz and any other shareholder could exit at a later date. assuming the share swap is done at book value for both banks, and none of the shareholders sell their stakes before completion of the merger, the shareholding structure post merger is likely to be: the epf with 27.9%, aabar at 10.2%, osk at 5.8%, anz at 10.2% and azman with 5.6%. it makes sense. its easier for anz to sell a 10% stake in an enlarged bank rather than a 24% stake in a smaller bank and it will be the same for rhb shareholders that may want to exit. placing out a 10% block in an enlarged banking group with a rm37 billion market capitalisation will be easier, i reckon, says a banking analyst that covers both the stocks, adding that an all-share deal would be less dilutive and that they can overcome the dilution in two to three years. maybank investment bank research says there is the risk of a potential share overhang should the major shareholders choose to exit. however, the combined shareholding of aabar, osk, anz and azman works out to be 31.5% post-merger and it would be a positive if a strategic shareholder could be identified to take up this block, it writes in a june 2 note. dbs group research notes: while it is still early days, what remains a risk is the acceptance by the other key stakeholders. deal-breakers for most m&as would be pricing or shareholders disapproval. the most recent banking merger in malaysia was between hong leong bank bhd and eon capital bhd in 2011, which was done at 1.4 bv (see chart). this was a period when banks return on equity (roe) and net interest margins were notably higher. in the current environment of u00adstricter capital requirements amid the competitive landscape, valuations may not necessarily be as attractive, public investment bank research says. upon resumption of trading last friday, rhb and ammbs shares fell. rhbs stock fell 3.71% to close at rm5.19 while ambank was down 2.3% to rm5.09. interestingly, the trading volume in both counters jumped last wednesday, the day before the stock was suspended. ammbs volume soared 546% from the day earlier to 28.5 million shares  over eight times its one-year daily average of 3.25 million. as for rhb, its volume rose 182% from the day earlier to 2.6 million shares, higher than its one-year daily average of 1.82 million. rhb and ammb, in separate stock exchange filings on june 1, said they had obtained bank negara malaysias approval, which is valid until nov 30, to start discussions for a possible merger of their business and undertakings. the two banks have now entered into a three-month exclusivity agreement, which expires on aug 30, to negotiate and finalise the pricing, structure, and other terms and conditions. they said there could be an automatic extension of the exclusivity period, if needed. the merger will make the enlarged group no 1 in asset management, general insurance and equities broking, and no 2 in islamic banking. it would also make it the ninth largest bank by assets in asean, creating a bigger platform for it to grow further at home and regionally. in an internal memo to staff on june 2, azman and ammb group ceo datuk sulaiman tahir said, given the challenging state of malaysias banking industry, a merger of this nature would allow ammb to tap onto greater opportunities. as a larger entity, there is greater potential to compete on a larger scale, including on a regional level. new possibilities for career advancement and professional development will certainly open up as the merger is expected to lead us into a much bigger league, they said. a day earlier, rhbs ceo had also sent a similar memo reassuring staff about the merger. indeed a merger between rhb and ammb would propel the total assets between them to rm365.88 billion, only slightly behind the rm380.05 billion of the third largest banking group, public bank bhd. ammb, on its own, is the sixth largest. while it is obvious the merger would bring about a larger banking group, banking analysts say significant cost synergies are required for the merged entity to be accretive. based on a back-of-the-envelope calculation on revenue attrition downside and cost synergies, uob kay hian estimates that the merged entity will be required to shed about 18% of its combined staff headcount of roughly 25,000 and 20% of other operating cost (for example, branches, it and marketing) for it to realise a positive uplift in roe from the current 8.3% to 10.0%. key to its assumption is a potential revenue attrition of 15%, which the research house believes is realistic given the inherent duplications within the merged entitys corporate and investment banking division. as the potential scale of such an exercise could involve an estimated 4,000 staff and closure of 80-100 branches, it will require a fair degree of gestation, it says. indeed, should the shareholders give the green light for the deal, the other hurdles to pass would be realising cost synergies and efficient execution of the exercise. now, that would be when the real marathon starts.

"}, "135": {"date_posted": "13/6/2017", "title": "news: new etfs bode well for investors and stakeholders", "article": " the introduction of new exchange-traded funds (etfs) in the near future will benefit investors, financial planners, fund managers and etf providers, say industry players. bryan zeng, general manager of fa advisory sdn bhd, is excited about the new types of products, such as inverse and leverage etfs, which will provide investors with a new way to apply short selling and leverage strategies in their investments. he says these products will give investors and financial planners more options when it comes to navigating the challenging economic environment. the prospect of having a variety of etfs is very exciting as these types of investments are currently not available in malaysia. if these can be implemented in an efficient manner, it will give investors and financial planners additional options that could help them navigate the ever-changing economic environment to reach their financial goals, says zeng. the etf task force, chaired by the securities commission malaysia, announced last month that it had recommended the introduction of new varieties of etfs in the local market next year. in addition to inverse and leverage etfs, the new products include commodity-based and smart beta etfs. commodity-based etfs track the prices of a specific commodity, such as gold or silver, while smart beta etfs track the movements of an alternative index that is constructed differently from a conventional index to enhance returns. there are also synthetic etfs, which could replicate the index movements of a market by utilising derivatives such as swap contracts, instead of buying the component stocks of the index, which may not be accessible to some etf providers. danny wong, ceo of areca capital sdn bhd, is positive on the launch of these etfs, particularly the synthetic ones, as they could provide investors with access to new markets and sectors. he says the new etfs could spur providers to come out with more products that utilise derivatives, which they are currently unable to provide as they have no access to the stocks in these indices. this is beneficial to boutique firms such as ourselves that want to trade in a variety of markets and sectors that we currently have no access to. unlike bank-backed fund houses, we do not have the capacity to trade freely in some regional and global markets or sectors, says wong. with synthetic etfs, we can enter more markets or sectors in a bull trend and do our stock-picking later. we will not be left behind the market trend due to our limited capability. wong is interested in any etf that could provide exposure to developed market indices such as those in europe and the us. he says the markets in developed economies are very efficient and it is hard for fund managers to stock-pick and outperform the benchmark. thus, etfs could provide access to the broader market movements of these countries. wong expects to see etfs that provide exposure to different market sectors. for instance, an etf could provide us exposure to the mining sector. we only have a few mining companies in malaysia, but there are many in australia. another example is an etf that tracks crude oil prices, instead of us accessing the market indirectly via public-listed oil companies, he says. mahdzir othman, ceo of i-vcap management sdn bhd, a local etf provider, says the introduction of these products will mean more etf providers joining the industry. this will make the industry more vibrant and robust. there are only a few providers here and sometimes we feel quite lonely. i am glad to see more industry players coming in so we can raise awareness and build the ecosystem together, says mahdzir. zeng says some of the financial planners will be interested in distributing these etfs and include them in their clients portfolios, even though the intermediaries that distribute products do not charge any sales fees. sales charges and distribution incentives are not the only consideration. if these products are suitable for clients, i will not hesitate to recommend them. he adds that the financial planning industry is moving from a commission-based model to fee-based one, which could help stem product-pushing behaviour and the intermediaries could focus more on the clients real needs. this could help etfs to be distributed more widely. besides facilitating the new varieties of etfs that will be made available locally, the task force has also recommended lowering the minimum capital requirement for etf issuers to rm2 million from rm10 million previously. this will also help bring more etf providers into the market, says mahdzir. there are eight etfs listed on the local bourse. the first  the abf malaysia bond index etf, managed by amfunds management bhd  was launched in july 2005. the other etfs are the ftse bursa malaysia klci etf, cimb ftse asean 40 malaysia, cimb ftse china 50, myetf dow jones islamic market malaysian titans 25, myetf msci malaysia islamic dividend, myetf southeast asia islamic dividend and myetf thomson reuters asia-pacific ex-japan islamic agribusiness. challenges ahead i-vcap management sdn bhd ceo mahdzir othman says the recommendations of the etf task force, which is chaired by the securities commission malaysia, are welcomed. nevertheless, there are challenges ahead. one of them is to get more fund houses to trade etfs and drive liquidity in the market. there are currently only eight etfs traded on the local bourse. mahdzir says most local fund houses have the mindset that etfs do not add much value to their portfolios. this mindset has to change. they have to view etfs more openly when more products are

digestible by the man in the street. these research reports are among the recommendations of the etf task force. it is not easy for research firms to produce good etf reports. they may not have tracked the movements of an index for the past few years to understand how it behaves. also, while research firms may have a year-end target for certain indices such as the fbm klci, they may not have one for some sector-focused or alternative indices, says mahdzir. research firms will not be able to apply the same method of writing analyst reports for etfs. they cannot analyse all the component stocks in an etf. it will be very lengthy and hard to understand for the man in the street. they may need to sit down with industry players, such as etf providers and fund managers, to discuss the

march 31 has been touted as the defining moment for the rally seen in the stock market this year. investors are closely monitoring the numbers to see if they justify the rise in share prices. up to may 18, about 60% of the 96 companies listed on bursa malaysia that have announced their results have seen better earnings compared with the corresponding quarter a year ago. about 37% saw a decline while the remaining 3% showed a flat performance. according to bloomberg data, almost 50% of the companies that are covered by research houses have outperformed expectations. the first-quarter earnings will have a big impact on the sustainability of the share price rally. the results are almost certainly better than what we had seen last year. the big problem is that a lot of these recoveries have been priced in. the run-up has been so sharp this year. what im more concerned about is if the earnings fail to live up to the high expectations of the market, says pong teng siew, head of research at inter-pacific research sdn bhd. according to him, earnings are still on firm ground  especially in the first quarter  but investors will now be looking for signs of sustainable growth beyond the quarters results. etiqa insurance & takaful head of research chris eng agrees, saying that earnings have been on track and within expectations so far. however, the market has moved ahead of earnings for some of the companies, he points out. ever since the fbm klci breached the 1,770 level, we have not been as bullish about the market and believe that investors should gradually take profit as we expect to see some weakness. nonetheless, with the results showing positive outlook, it (fbm klci) could still head towards the 1,800 level u2026 theres nothing wrong with the local market and the market sentiment. the concern is more on the global market, says eng. some of the external factors that he mentions are the investigation into us president donald trumps ties to russia, and the geou00adpolitical tension involving north korea. the stock market appears to have hit a bumpy road as fears of more trouble ahead for the trump presidency spread across global markets. the fbm klci has fallen for three consecutive days up to last thursday  something that has only happened three times this year before the latest decline. a fund manager with a local asset management company, however, brushed off the decline as a temporary blip and insists that stronger earnings will keep the market momentum moving into the second half of 2017.  construction: 2016 contracts translate into better earnings jeremy goh, an analyst with hong leong investment bank, says the construction sector in general will see strong earnings results for the quarter ended march 31. in general, if you look at the contracts that have been announced on bursa malaysia, 2016 saw a record high of rm56.4 billion [domestic contracts awarded to listed contractors] and usually, the impact on profit will come in a year later for a span of three years, says goh. he adds that the momentum for the market rally hinges on the performance of corporate earnings. the stock market will be a bit jittery if earnings disappoint but if it meets expectations, the momentum will continue. of course, investors would probably still be hopeful if the first-quarter earnings were not on track as they would probably take a wait-and-see approach. but whats certain is that the numbers for the first six months will be crucial to keep the momentum going, says goh. pong concurs but believes that certain companies will perform well in the second half. he highlights econpile holdings bhd as one of the construction companies that is positioned to benefit from the upcoming contracts to be awarded.  banking: proxy for economic growth public bank bhd was one of the first few banks to announce its first-quarter results for the financial year ending dec 31, 2017 (1qfy2017). net profit rose a marginal 1.5% to rm1.25 billion from rm1.23 billion a year ago. with the malaysian economy expected to improve moving into next year, the banking sector is likely to see better days ahead, says etiqas eng. in the first quarter of this year, the economy grew at its fastest pace in two years as gross domestic product rose 5.6%, according to bank negara malaysia. the banking sector is viewed as a support to economic growth. thus, the earnings releases of malayan banking bhd, cimb group holdings bhd, rhb bank bhd and hong leong bank bhd this week will be closely monitored. the bursa malaysia finance index has increased 13.6% year to date (up to may 18).  plantation: better 1q but weakness in 2h expected the plantation sector is also expected to see better earnings this week on a year-on-year basis. alan lim, an analyst at midf research, says the results could be weaker sequentially but better year on year, in tandem with the movement in crude palm oil prices. eng says, while the earnings results are likely to be better in the first quarter as well as the first half, analysts are expecting a weaker second half as a result of weaker cpo prices. on this basis, despite better earnings in the first quarter, most analysts feel that it is in line with expectations. the plantation players that will be announcing their results this week include kuala lumpur kepong bhd and sime darby bhd.  oil and gas: gradual recovery but volatile oil price a key risk an analyst with a local research house says the outlook for the oil and gas sector remains weak and he expects its earnings to remain flattish. the oil price is still volatile while the capital expenditure will take some time to come through. of course, we have seen a strong rally in some of the o&g counters but its mainly due to a sharp collapse in some of these companies in the last two years. currently, some of the shares are already back to their fair value and i wouldnt advocate chasing after them, he says. petronas dagangan bhd is one of the o&g companies that has announced its first-quarter results  it saw a 15.4% growth in net profit to rm253.2 million. most of the o&g companies that announced their results last week saw better earnings than the year before. raymond yap, of cimb research, says in a report that the 1qfy2017 results for petronas dagangan were within expectations but a downward surprise was seen in the decline of sales volume by 4% year on year.  consumer: weak consumer sentiment persists after rallying in the last two years, the consumer sector is not looking too bright as sentiment remains weak, according to an analyst from ta securities. she says a lot of consumer players have had to raise prices due to the rising cost of commodities. with the pressure from rising inflation as well as the weaker ringgit, this has led to weak consumer sentiment. earnings are expected to be weaker or remain flattish compared with the previous years results.

structural change, which resulted mainly from its sales decline in indonesia. cimb originally anticipated a better 1q17 showing on expectations of delfi building on 2016 momentum due to own-brand improvement and better premium product sales, explains seow  but underestimated the impact of the groups product rationalisation initiatives, which culled about 30% of stock keeping units (skus) in the country since the exercise began in 2h16. the sales decline in indonesia was further exacerbated by what the analyst refers to as timing issues, whereby sales in 1q16 factored in higher-than-usual deliveries as trade customers replenished their supply pipelines. going forward, we think the product rationalisation programme will continue to hinder near-term sales, notes seow. however, we like the companys strategy of focusing on its core brands and we think this will better position the business in the long term, as well as improve profitability as the company frees up resources on underperforming skus. cimb is therefore keeping its fy17-19f earnings estimates for delfi unchanged, on expectations of an earnings recovery in 2h17, although weaker-than-expected sales remains a key

investment banking ", "article": " interest in investment banking has returned, says cimb group holdings bhd chairman datuk seri nazir razak. there seems to be a recovery in terms of interest to do deals and i think part of that is driven by leadership changes in some organisations, for instance, pnb (permodalan nasional bhd) group. these new leaders are looking at new ways to create value and youve seen some deals announced. i think even in other areas, there is a sense that people have been too docile in terms of deals. deals can be done to reduce costs and synergise for more revenue. i certainly feel from the marketplace that there is a lot of interest again to approach investment bankers, nazir said at a press conference after cimbs 60th annual general meeting last friday. cimb group ceo tengku datuk seri zafrul aziz says the corporate segment has seen strong loan growth since the last quarter of the groups financial year ended dec 31, 2016 (4qfy2016). we are quite optimistic the momentum created in 4qfy2016 is sustainable. the corporate sector should be able to sustain the growth started last year, zafrul adds. moving forward, both the chairman and group ceo believe the outlook for the banking group has improved. the outlook for cimb is better than it has been for some time now. the whole asean platform  all the engines seem to be revving up in the right direction, nazir says. zafrul adds, given what we have done and the measures taken, were a bit more optimistic. we hope to achieve another record in revenue and growth in the top line but, at the same time, with corresponding improvement in profit this year. this is provided we ensure we control our provisions to the level we expect this year. we expect provisions to be lower than they were last year. cimb group registered a record revenue of rm16.1 billion in fy2016 while net profit came in at rm3.6 billion. nazir says the group will place more emphasis on the use of technology, as seen in its digital banking efforts in indonesia and the launch of cimb enhanced virtual assistance (eva) in malaysia. cimb eva is the first chat-bot banking application in asean that was recognised as the internet banking product of the year by the asian bankers international excellence in retail financial services awards programme 2017. while cimb group is positive that the countrys economic outlook for this year is brighter, nazir says the government still has much work to do when it comes to overcoming negativities that have caused the slump in the ringgit in recent years. relative to peer economies, i think there is still work to do in terms of attracting more interest in the ringgit and investment in malaysia. weve been through tough times in the past few years in relative terms. the government has work to do to overcome those negativities, he says. nevertheless, nazir says he is heartened to see corporates conducting roadshows to attract more investors, which indicates that they are coming back to the stock market. when asked if cimb groups recent introduction of 0% interest for up to five years on housing loans of no more than rm250,000 was to help employees battle the rising cost of living, he says the group is doing what it can to help. he urged the corporate sector to also increase its emphasis on corporate social responsibility if it could. "}, "150": {"date_posted": "11/5/2017", "title": "cover story: cimb moves forward", "article": " last year, cimb group holdings bhd saw consumer banking become the largest contributor to its profit before tax  a first for the group, whose strength traditionally lay in investment banking. clearly, the group is no longer heavily reliant on the latter. has this been a conscious structural shift or a cyclical one? some may say tepid deal flow led to the smaller contribution of the fee income business, thus making sense of the increase in consumer banking. and it does not seem likely that wholesale banking  which includes investment banking, corporate banking and treasury and markets  will be the dominant income generator at cimb, like it was when the economic climate was conducive to deal making. in fact, growing consumer bankings income contribution is one of cimbs target 18 (t18) goals. the group outlined t18 in february 2015, targeting a return on equity of 15%, common equity tier 1 ratio of more than 11%, cost-to-income ratio of less than 50% and consumer banking income contribution of 60%  which includes contribution from commercial banking  by end-2018.  in an exclusive interview with the edge, group ceo tengku datuk seri zafrul aziz says the banking group is learning to engage with markets that it never focused on before. we want to go back to our natural market share. in malaysia, we should be top two [in the small and medium enterprise market] but were not [now]. weve been conservative in our engagement with the smes; weve been very corporate. even in consumer banking, weve always been preferred rather than mass. these are the markets that we need to tap into and where you will see growth as we start engaging with them. noting the huge potential of consumer banking, he says the business has done very well because of its smaller scale compared with wholesaling. nevertheless, stresses zafrul, who took over the ceos reins from chairman datuk seri nazir razak, cimb has not sidelined wholesale banking. indeed, it has managed to maintain its position on the league table. weve always told our staff that we cannot drop off the league table, says zafrul. analysts believe things will pick up in cimbs wholesaling this year as they expect the business to recover from last years low base effect. uob kay hian research has projected an 8% year-on-year growth in fee income this year. during the 2013 general election, brokerage and underwriting charges were the drivers of cimbs fee income growth, says the research house. meanwhile, cimb is starting to see the results of engaging with new market segments. last year, we were surprised to see loan growth of 10.5% in malaysia  double the industrys. all our segments grew and, yes, we went into markets we had never before. we could do that because we structured our team in such a way that we were clear about the areas we were weak in and we invested in them  technology, people and processes. it was simple for consumer banking. we grew the fastest in mortgages, personal financing and credit cards in malaysia because we were better in our data analytics and mining, which enabled us to better target customers that needed those products, explains zafrul, whose previous jobs were mainly in investment banking. in the financial year ended dec 31, 2016, consumer banking contributed rm2.27 billion or 46.4% to cimbs profit before tax while wholesale banking accounted for rm1.96 billion or 40.1%. revenue came in at rm16.05 billion, up 4% from the previous year, while net profit improved to rm3.56 billion from rm2.85 billion before.  are the targets being met? according to zafrul, since taking the hot seat at cimb two years ago, his journey has been challenging and humbling. the banking group saw significant changes in its leadership and strategy in a lacklustre economic environment. the economy grew but not as much as we thought it would. fortunately, given what we had done over the last two years, we have been able to navigate the difficult times, zafrul comments. when cimb launched t18 in 2015, its cost-to-income ratio stood at 59%. the aim was to reduce this to less than 50% by end-2018. as at fy2016, the group had managed to bring the ratio down to 53.9%. it more than achieved its t18 common equity tier 1 ratio as at fy2016, with 11.3%. we are halfway through t18 and we didnt expect the markets to be so challenging but we adjusted. despite our income not growing by 9% to 10% as anticipated, our common equity tier 1 ratio has improved because we made some very difficult decisions on cost and accelerated some of the things we needed to do, says zafrul. he credits members of his senior management, or his dream team, with helping drive t18 and meet its targets. analysts believe cimb is on track to achieve most of its t18 goals except roe, which zafrul admits may be difficult. says an analyst with a local bank, they are making progress u2026 but the roe target is off, which is why management revised it down to between 10.5% and 11% from 15%. that they would miss the target was expected, given the current difficult operating environment at home and abroad like in indonesia and thailand. an analyst with a foreign bank concurs. they are on track but it is not possible to meet the 15% roe target they have for t18. i think they should be able to get to 9.5% this year. while an roe of 15% is out of the banking groups reach now, zafrul says it should be at least on a par with or better than that of its regional peers by 2018. cimbs roe stood at 8.3% as at fy2016, falling short of its 10% target for the year due to impairments. our engine is running well with revenue hitting rm16 billion last year. we are managing cost better and weve focused on ensuring theres no capital dilution. what we need to improve on now is to be more vigilant for asset quality. malaysia has been a good story of how we have managed to maintain low provisions and impairments. but we need to make sure our regional operating model and our teams overseas continue to improve on this. if they do that, our numbers would be better, provided that the other aspects continue to grow as well, says zafrul. cimb is expecting loan impairment to be lower this year than in fy2016 as it is expecting the thai, indonesian and singaporean markets to grow and the home market to remain stable. we are more optimistic about this year because we think the indonesian economy is finally turning around and being one of the largest banks there, we will see an improvement. last year, loan growth in that country was zero, comments zafrul. maybank investment research says asset quality in indonesia has yet to show any sign of recovery with the industrys non-performing loan ratio rising to 3.1% in january this year from 2.9% in december 2016. nevertheless, pt bank cimb niaga tbk has not seen a significant increase in npls. cimb niagas credit cost is expected to gradually decline to below 200bps by end-fy2017 but guidance is that it should average around 200bps to 220 bps in fy2017 versus an average of 273bps in fy2016, says the research house. it adds that there is upside potential for earnings if credit costs surprise positively. this is based on its forecast that every 5bps reduction in credit cost will improve earnings by 3%. while only halfway through t18, the banking group is already pondering its next move. zafrul says post-t18, cimb will probably focus on growth. in the meantime, the banking group unveiled its new tagline: forward. forward is cimbs evolution. weve had asean for you for eight years now and were transitioning to forward. were changing our proposition: its about moving forward. moving from an investment bank to a universal bank to a regional universal bank and today, we need to move forward for our customers. forward means to position ourselves to move forward for our stakeholders, customers, staff and shareholders. this is also a part of t18 because we want people to work better together as a team. the whole bank is complex as it cuts across divisions and geographies to work as one. [we want to] cut the silos. it has to come together as one, zafrul asserts. its about focusing on the customers, staff and shareholders. its about the people. over the last one year, cimbs share price has gained nearly 28%, from rm4.50 to rm5.75 last wednesday. maybank research has a buy call and target price of rm6.30 on the counter. it says valuations are still decent with the stock trading at a prospective fy2017 price-earnings ratio of 11.1 times. uob kay hian research maintains its hold call on the share with a target price of rm5.60. it opines that the banking groups strong earnings recovery has been factored into the share price, as reflected in its earnings growth assumption of 21% for this year."}, "151": {"date_posted": "11/5/2017", "title": "investing: use leverage to invest in non-ringgit assets", "article": " now is a good time for investors to use leverage via non-ringgit assets overseas, according to danny chang, head of managed investments and product management at standard chartered bank malaysia bhd. that is because the countrys inflation rate, measured by the consumer price index, rose to an eight-year high of 4.5% in february, according to the statistics department. if the ringgit continues to be weak, the inflation rate could remain high. by comparison, fixed deposit rates are about 3%, from about 4% last year. the local stock market has not fared better. returns have been about 3% in the last 5 to 10 years. the local stock market is still lagging behind its regional peers despite the recent recovery, says chang. he says investors should consider these factors when looking for investment opportunities overseas. by applying leverage appropriately, they will be able to enhance their returns despite the low-yield, low-return environment. chang says affluent individuals are likely to continue investing in non-ringgit assets overseas, judging by the trend he sees at the bank and in the industry. that is because investors are now more sophisticated when it comes to diversification and there is a growing supply of financial products that invest in non-ringgit assets overseas. pramod veturi, country head of wealth management at standard chartered bank malaysia, spoke to personal wealth after the launch of standard chartereds wealth power leverage financing facility, which enables investors to magnify their investments by 1.5 to 9 times against their collateral in bonds, unit trusts, structured investments and insurance products for potentially higher returns. the amount of leverage depends on the investors financial health. the collateral can also be in fixed deposits. the facility, the first to be introduced by a foreign retail bank in malaysia, carries more than 150 unit trust funds and an equivalent amount of fixed-income bond securities. investors who use the facility to leverage are only allowed to invest in these funds. the recommended unit trust funds include the cimb-principal us mortgage fund, affin hwang world series  us short duration high income fund, eastspring investments asian high yield bond my fund and rhb asian high yield fund. pramod says the facility allows investors to borrow directly in six currencies  the us, australia, new zealand and singapore dollars as well as the euro and pound sterling  which will help them minimise foreign exchange risks.  lets say the individual invests in australian dollar assets. he wont be impacted when the ringgit strengthens against the aussie, he says, adding that the spread the bank charges clients for borrowing via wealth power is 1.5%. will investors suffer a loss after taking into account the spread?

remarks the investment banker. the head of another local ib concurs. it is for sure a more active market this year. apart from having more deals in the pipeline, we are also busy pitching for more ipo jobs. we are definitely more active this year, he reveals. the stock market started heating up from january, with the fbm klci peaking at 1,754.67  its highest close in 22 months  on march 23. the benchmark index had gained 5.92% this year as at the april 19 close of 1,738.95. but it was only from february that daily trading volumes got noticeably stronger. the average since february is 3.2 billion shares compared with 1.69 billion shares in the same period last year. the average daily trading value, meanwhile, is rm2.63 billion compared with rm1.94 billion in the same period last year. its a clear indication that investor interest is back. with those kind of daily average volumes, you know that syndicates and speculation activity are back. it is not necessarily a bad thing as it lifts overall market sentiment, says the earlier investment banker. improved sentiment helps create appetite for new listings, he adds. he, nevertheless, cautions that ibs may have just a small window to ride the current positive sentiment. with [us president donald] trumps warmongering and geopolitical tensions, a major correction or crash could be coming. thats my view, he says, adding that this could dampen appetite for new listings. so far this year, there have been six new listings  three on the main market (kip reit, serba dinamik holdings bhd, eco world international bhd) and the rest on the ace market (hlt global bhd, matang bhd, eversafe rubber bhd)  that collectively raised rm3.47 billion. the latest was eversafes, a tyre retreading firm, which was listed just last friday. eversafes shares made available for the malaysian public was oversubscribed by a whopping 64.99 times. the rm2.58 billion raised from eco worlds listing  the years biggest so far  earlier this month already exceeds the total of rm1.03 billion raised in malaysia last year from 12 listings. in 2013, some rm3.88 billion was raised from 13 new listings. among the big ipos anticipated in the market this year is south korean conglomerate lotte groups malaysian petrochemical unit, sometime in the third quarter. the listing of lotte chemical titan holding bhd on bursa malaysias main market could reportedly raise as much as us$1.5 billion, which would make it one of the biggest in the region this year. in malaysia, there has not been an ipo that raised over us$1 billion since the 2012 flotations of astro malaysia holdings bhd (us$1.5 billion), felda global ventures holdings bhd (us$3.3 billion) and ihh healthcare bhd (us$2.1 billion). maybank investment bank bhd is the principal adviser on the lotte chemical ipo. apart from lotte chemical, the other anticipated big ipo is that of qsr brands (m) holdings sdn bhd, which sources say could be relisted either this year or the next. news reports indicate that it could raise rm1.6 billion or more. qsr has picked citigroup, credit suisse and maybank ib to lead the ipo, bloomberg reported last november, citing sources familiar with the matter. qsr operates the kfc and pizza hut restaurant franchises in malaysia. smaller ipos this year include that of building contractor inta bina group bhd  which plans to list on the ace market in the second quarter  and earthworks and civil engineering services group advancecon holdings bhd on the main market in mid-year. the size of the ipo matters to the ibs as they generally take a percentage of the amount raised as their fee. in any ipo, ibs usually earn the most from placement, underwriting and advisory fees, in that order, bankers say. for underwriting, ibs generally earn around 2% of the amount raised from the ipo, says an investment banker. this falls on the lower end of the scale of what ibs earn in the region. given the stiff competition at home, ibs sometimes agree to lower fees in order to land the job, he explains. among the busiest ibs for the ipos so far this year are maybank ib, cimb investment bank bhd and m&a securities sdn bhd. maybank ib, in particular, is one to watch given that it seems to be involved in all the big ipos to come. it was the joint adviser to eco worlds ipo, together with cimb ib and hong leong investment bank bhd. m&a, a wholly-owned subsidiary of insas bhd, has been involved in ace market listings, including that of matang in january, which raised rm16.9 million, and the upcoming inta bina ipo. the second biggest listing so far this year  serba dinamiks on feb 8, which raised rm584.1 million, had affin hwang investment bank bhd and rhb investment bank bhd as joint advisers.

that despite the downturn, the group continued to pay steady dividends in the last three financial years. according to data from the audit bureau of circulations (abc), the combined circulation of sin chew daily, china press and guang ming daily declined 21% to 602,081 copies in first half of 2016 from 760,140 copies in first half of 2013 (see bar chart). it is worth noting that nanyang siang pau no longer submits its numbers to abc, but data compiled by adqrate sdn bhd shows that the newspaper sells 80,000 copies per publishing day (see table). in terms of adex, all four titles saw a decline from 2013 to 2016 (see line chart). on a more positive note, mcils flagship product, sin chew daily, has 1.4 million readers  its highest ever. combined with the groups other publications, mcil reaches 2.7 million readers today. the group also operates charming holidays, a travel agency in hong kong, as well as delta tours & travel services in canada and the us. in the nine months ended dec 31, 2016 (9mfy2017), mcil saw its net profit decline 40% year on year to rm64.3 million. revenue also fell 14% y-o-y to rm1.07 billion. on the weaker financial performance, mcil says its tour and travel-related service segment has been adversely affected by weak consumer spending, reduced demand for european tours amid security concerns and competitive peer pressure. for its fourth quarter ended march 31, 2017 (4qfy2017), mcil remains conservative on the prospect of the overall business environment in view of uncertainties in global economic conditions and persistent softness in the advertising market. currently, four research houses  kenanga research, hong leong investment bank (hlib) research, amresearch and alliancedbs research  have rated mcil as a hold. two others  affin hwang capital and cimb research  have a sell call. their target prices are between 47 sen and 67 sen. maybank kim eng research is the only one that has a buy recommendation, with a target price of 72 sen. taking bloombergs consensus target price of 59 sen, mcil could have a 7% downside, based on its closing price of 63 sen last thursday. year to date, the counter has risen 4%, giving the group a market capitalisation of rm1.06 billion. the stock is trading at a trailing 12-month (ttm) per of 14 times. in a feb 28 report, kenanga research media analyst cheow ming liang highlights that mcils outlook remains challenging in view of the countrys subdued consumer spending, shrinking advertising expenditure and currency volatility. while newsprint prices are expected to remain firm, they may have an adverse impact should the ringgit continue to u00addepreciate against the us dollar. the groups travel business, meanwhile, is expected to continue to face difficult market conditions amid growing safety and security concerns as well as cut-throat competition, he says. having said that, we understand that the group will continue to step up efforts to diversify its revenue stream, such as e-commerce, and focus on improving operational efficiencies, he says. hlib research analyst nafisah azmi says mcil is expected to face more challenges due to soft adex expectations, slowing economy in greater china and the continued decline in the tourism industry in europe. although we favour mcil for its prudent cost management and strong cash generative business, we believe that adex will remain soft mainly due to macro headwinds and poor consumer sentiment, she says. hlib research maintains its hold call with an unchanged target price of 61 sen, based on a per of 9.5 times. as widely expected, no dividend was declared for the third quarter as mcil normally rewards its shareholders in the second and fourth quarters of each financial year. however, it is learnt that management intends to distribute a minimum 50% of its profit as dividend or to provide for a 6% dividend yield. previously, mcil had said it might reward its shareholders with a special dividend from the disposal of one media group ltd for hk$498 million. if there is money, of course we can [consider], mcil executive director and ceo francis tiong kiew chiong told reporters after the groups annual general meeting on aug 12 last year. kiew chiong is a distant relative of group executive chairman tan sri tiong hiew king. we have to fulfil the condition precedent, a circular has to be issued to shareholders, and we have to convene an egm (extraordinary general meeting). after we have gone through that process, then only the money will come in. we can talk about a special dividend after that, executive director patrick leong chew meng said. mcil is expected to see a net gain of hk$363 million from the sale of its 73% stake in one media to chinese state-owned company, qingdao west coast holdings international ltd. the hong kong-listed one media is a media subsidiary of mcil focusing on greater china. apart from ming pao weekly in hong kong, one media also publishes ming watch magazine in china and hong kong, and topgear magazine in china, hong kong and taiwan. at its current price, mcil is offering a ttm dividend yield of 6.7%. the bermuda-incorporated firm declared a dividend per share (dps) of 1.1 us cents, 0.93 us cent, 1.43 us cents in fy2016, fy2015 and fy2014 respectively. it is worth noting that mcil paid a bumper dividend of 13 us cents in november 2012, bringing its total dps in fy2013 to 14.68 us cents.

required to maintain a reserve fund. instead, they must maintain a set minimum amount of capital funds at all times. minimum capital funds requirements are introduced as an important entry and ongoing requirements to ensure a banking institution maintains a minimum size of capital to operate and perform its intermediation function effectively, said bank negara malaysia (bnm) in its policy document on capital funds. under the new requirements, a licensed locally incorporated foreign bank is required to have a minimum of rm300 million in capital funds, which is the sum of paid-up ordinary shares, preference shares, irredeemable convertible unsecured loan stock, retained earnings and other disclosed reserves. meanwhile, a licensed foreign bank which is not locally incorporated must have at least rm2 billion in capital funds, either by the bank itself or in aggregation with the capital funds of its related corporation that is a licensed investment bank. for licensed investment banks that are not related to any licensed bank, a minimum of rm500 million is required in capital funds. in addition to the minimum capital funds requirement, a banking institution must also comply with the minimum regulatory capital requirement as set out in the capital adequacy framework (capital components) and capital adequacy framework (basel ii  risk-weighted assets), said the central bank. bnm said it expects banking institutions to exercise prudence before submitting an application to distribute the reserves as dividends, adding that it will consider the institutions ability to comply with the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer requirement and any other buffers that it may specify. cimb investment bank analyst winson ng said in a note that the research house does not expect this move to translate into higher dividend payments, as the banking institutions would still have to comply with the requirements under basel iii. overall, we are neutral on the above announcement. although banks will no longer need to maintain a reserve fund, we do not expect an increase in their dividend payment as they still have to comply with the stringent capital requirements under the basel iii accord. ng said the minimum regulatory requirement for common equity tier-1 capital ratio is 4.5% under basel iii, and that banks are also required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of up to 2.5%. banks are also subject to countercyclical capital buffer above the minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratio."}, "157": {"date_posted": "28/4/2017", "title": "better earnings ahead for

bhd chairman datuk seri nazir razak said interest in investment banking has returned and this could help sustain the group's growth this year. there seems to be a recovery in terms of interest to do deals and i think part of that is driven by leadership changes in some organisations like the pnb (permodalan nasional bhd) group for instance. [these] new leaderships [are] looking at new ways to create value and youve seen some deals announced. i think even in other areas, there is a sense that people have been too docile in terms of deals. deals can be done to reduce costs, deals can be done to synergise for more revenues. i certainly feel from the market place that there is a lot of interest again to approach investment bankers, nazir said during a press conference, after the groups 60th annual general meeting today. cimb group chief executive officer tengku datuk seri zafrul aziz is also bullish of the outlook for the corporate segment, which has seen strong loan growth in the last quarter of the group's financial year ended dec 31, 2016 (4qfy16). we are quite optimistic [that] the momentum created in 4q(fy16) will be sustainable. the corporate sector should be able to see sustain growth that was started last year, zafrul said. investment banking, corporate banking, treasury and markets, transaction banking, equities and private banking are all lumped under the wholesale banking segment. in 2016, wholesale banking contributed about 40% to the group's profit before tax (pbt), while consumer banking contributed 46% and commercial banking made up 6%. the remaining was from the groups asset management and investment (gami), and group funding. zafrul said since economic outlook for 2017 improved compared with last year, cimb group is optimistic about recording better revenue and bottom line, following the provisions the group made last year. in fy16, cimb group registered a record revenue of rm16.1 billion, while net profit grew to rm3.6 billion. moving forward, nazir and zafrul both said the group will put more emphasis on the use of technology, as seen in the groups digital banking efforts in indonesia and the launch of cimb enhanced virtual assistance (eva) in malaysia. cimb eva is the first chat-bot banking application in asean that was recognised as the internet banking product of the year at the international excellence in retail financial services awards programme 2017 by the asian banker. while cimb group is positive of an improvement in economic outlook in 2017, nazir said the government still has work to do to overcome negativities that have caused the ringgit to slump in recent years. relative to peer economies, i think there is still work to do in terms of attracting more interests to the ringgit and investment in malaysia. weve been through tough times in the past few years in relative terms. the government has work to do to overcome those negativities, he said. nevertheless, nazir said he was heartened to see more proactive actions taken by corporates by going into roadshows to attract more investors which have reflected positively in terms of investors coming back into the stock market. when asked if cimb group's recent introduction of a 0% housing loan for up to 5 years on loans no more than rm250,000 was to help employees battle rising cost of living, nazir said the cimb group is doing what they can to help. he called on the corporate sector to also increase their emphasis on corporate social responsibility (csr) if they

growth of 10.2% y-o-y (up 5.2% q-o-q) in gec in 1qfy17. this was mainly driven by the family takaful unit, which posted a strong expansion of 13.3% y-o-y in 1qfy17 gec. meanwhile, general takaful gec

dampen growth at nestlu00e9 (m) bhd. the food and beverage company, which has been growing earnings at strong single-digit rates for the past two consecutive years, expects to keep the growth momentum going in the financial year ending dec 31, 2017 (fy2017). i would love it if we can have single-digit growth this year. a 5% growth rate is considered to be good in a flattish environment, says its ceo alois hofbauer, but adds that the group does not make forward-looking statements. whats more important for us is to be able to deliver sustainable profitable growth year on year. we want to grow our top and bottom line in a sustainable manner, he tells the edge in an interview. after slipping 2% in fy2014, nestlu00e9 malaysias net profit rose for a second straight year in fy2016, rising 7.9% y-o-y to rm637.13 million. net profit grew 7.3% y-o-y to rm590.73 million for fy2015. last year was challenging due to the spillover effects of the goods and services tax. however, we managed to outperform all our targets, says hofbauer. he attributes the gains to the groups strategy of investing during challenging times. in 2013, we created a programme called fit, which stands for fuel, innovate and transform. every year, we set performance targets for the group and our employees to generate productivity gains and cost savings, which will be reinvested in the group. last year alone, the programme resulted in savings of rm197 million, which was reinvested in the business, allowing us to keep our margins strong, he says. as a global business, we also benefit from economies of scale. we have global procurement hubs where we buy and hedge [raw material costs]. so that gives us an advantage over local and regional players. this year, nestlu00e9 malaysia faces the prospect of rising input costs as prices of key commodities, such as sugar, coffee beans and milk, have been rising, which could put pressure on it to increase the prices of its products. commodity prices have come down for the past two years and are starting to pick up, hofbauer says. clearly, not all [costs] can be absorbed. so there will be occasional price increases and [if that happens, it will be done] in the most sensible manner. the increases will be done selectively and not across the board. the depreciation of the ringgit against the us dollar is also worrying nestlu00e9 malaysia as it translates into higher procurement cost for raw materials. however, looking at the groups performance in fy2016, hofbauer is confident that it can deliver another year of progress. we have demonstrated that we can produce strong results [even in challenging times]. top line growth [for fy2016] was close to 5%  crossing the rm5 billion mark for the first time  while the bottom line was up 8%. we paid a record high dividend [of rm2.70 per share] and strengthened our market share , while 10% of our domestic sales was driven by new products. so, i am very bullish about our prospects, he says. the group expects production efficiencies and improved margins to drive earnings growth this year as it adds value to its products. we continue to look for ways to add value to our products for our customers. while most of our products have been around for generations in malaysia, we try to give consumers better value y-o-y, says hofbauer. nestlu00e9 malaysia will also continue to invest substantially in its brand this year. last year, we spent rm500 million on advertising, excluding digital marketing. we have raised our advertising spend y-o-y and are today one of the top three advertising spenders in the country, hofbauer says. nestlu00e9 malaysia will also continue to grow its e-commerce business this year. hofbauer notes that e-commerce accounted for only a few hundred thousand ringgit of the groups revenue two years ago, which he deems insignificant, but this grew to over rm10 million last year. the target for this year is to increase it to rm40 million to rm50 million. my target is for online sales to eventually account for at least rm500 million, or 10% of total revenue, but i cant give you a timeline, he says. in october last year, nestlu00e9 malaysia joined hands with online retailers lazada and 11street to set up its flagship e-commerce store. meanwhile, nestlu00e9 malaysias export business, which grew at a faster rate than domestic sales last year, is expected to continue its growth momentum this year as demand for u00adhalal-certified products continues to be on the uptrend. currently, exports make up 20% of the groups total revenue. its locally produced halal products are u00adexported to u00adaffiliated companies in over 50 u00adcountries. there is an increasing demand for halal certified products because the muslim population in the world is growing, says hofbauer. still, he notes that the downside risk to nestlu00e9 malaysias export growth is that once some of the markets in which it currently exports to have achieved critical mass, they will set up their own halal factories. in the past 52 weeks, nestlu00e9 malaysias shares have traded at u00adbetween rm73.82 and rm81.80, and closed at rm76.60 last wednesday, valuing it at rm17.98 billion. in a note to clients on feb 28, cimb says although it continues to like nestlu00e9 malaysia for its consistent earnings delivery, strong brand name and solid product mix, the stock is fairly valued for now. upside risks include stronger-than-expected export demand and significant recovery in domestic spending, while downside risks include a substantial spike in raw material prices and/or us dollar versus the ringgit, it adds.

publishing industry, sees great prospects for its network marketing business. the group, which obtained its network marketing licence in april 2016, has so far attracted 4,500 members, said sasbadi co-founder and group managing director law king hui. for the current financial years first quarter ended nov 30, 2016 (1qfy17), the segment generated rm1.4 million in sales from the direct selling of its ilearn ace products, law told the edge financial daily. implementing the network marketing business was part of sasbadis move to diversify its revenue streams to stay relevant. the group, which started off as a pure education print publisher, has in recent years also diversified into the distribution of applied learning products and online publishing. this introduction of network marketing is believed to have pushed sasbadis share price higher since the later part of 2016. the counter, which closed at rm1.60 last friday, has risen by more than 50 sen since early october 2016. hong leong investment bank research said the share price hike is most likely due to the direct selling venture, noting that there is potential for the segment to grow. the research houses target price for the stock is rm1.63. law said sasbadi is still in the phase of gathering more members for its network marketing business. networking marketing is a more linear business model. you really dont know whats going to happen in the next quarter, he added. he said the members have shown sustained interest which he attributes to the sasbadi brand and the fact that the product being sold is education. law hopes to extend this direct-selling strategy business abroad, potentially with sasbadis indonesian partner, book publisher pt penerbit erlangga. the group currently has a licence and services agreement with penerbit erlangga that enables sasbadi to receive a one-off licensing fee and royalty of 8% based on net sales of its ilearn ace products. law said since signing the agreement in 2015, there has not been any significant sales. this, he said, is because the technology platform is a new concept in indonesia, and that technologically advanced products requiring live demonstration such as ilearn ace are better marketed through direct selling. law said in malaysia, the group is gaining good progress through this method as the products are exclusively sold through network marketing, unlike in indonesia where the products are sold through a conventional distribution method. we hope to be able to share with them [the network marketing method], he said. law stressed that sasbadi remains principally focused on its textbook publishing business and will continue tendering for contracts with the education ministry. it is currently participating in the tender for form 2 textbooks to be used in 2018. recently, sasbadi was awarded the rights by the malaysian examinations council to print and market past year question papers for the sijil tinggi persekolahan malaysia (stpm) examination and the malaysian university english test (muet). the last time sasbadi printed past year questions was from 2010 to 2013. the new contract will also last three years, from 2017 to 2019. cimb investment bank said this is a positive move that should boost sasbadis revenue for the next three years. we understand stpms past [year] examination papers are sold for rm9 to rm13 per paper, and muets for rm30 per paper. we estimate the potential markets for stpm and muet to be 40,000 and 200,000 respectively. assuming 20% of [the] potential market of 240,000 students buy past year question papers, sasbadi should record rm1.5 million sales annually, said cimb. law also spoke of his vision to embark on providing more experiential learning services and capitalise on it. dubbed as his third pillar of the business, he references sasbadis new collaboration partnership with universiti malaya (um) to provide accredited certification of robotic programmes to students. the collaboration with um is our effort to leverage on the deep knowledge base of um and [the] research facility to work together with us to develop credible science, technology, engineering and mathematics (stem) solutions. this is in line with the governments aim to have 60% malaysian children and youth in stem education by 2020. currently, it is at about 40%. on this, law said he hopes to create a franchisable product offering and offer it to education operators throughout the country to use in their own learning centres. sasbadi recently acquired distinct motion sdn bhd, which is involved in the business of conducting learning activities related to gadgets, automation systems and robotics technology. law said the acquisition was part of the groups plan to go downstream and offer a learning centre space to the public. however, moving forward, he said he does not want to focus so much on downstream services. instead, he plans to build a business model based on learning centres and offer its intellectual property to third parties. i think it will be very well received. stem will have huge demand. not many people are offering stem [solutions] right now. sasbadis net

mass-market developments, suggests there is still strong demand for properties in certain segments even though overall property market activities are weak. three out of the seven developers in our

a commercial property worth rm368 million. when excluded, uem sunrise sales target for 2017 is 20% higher than the actual sales in 2016. the developers appear to be optimistic about the property market conditions in 2017 relative to those in 2016, judging from their sales targets for this year. however, we think property sales could remain weak in the next few months. the unexciting wage growth prospects and inflationary pressures could continue to weigh on homebuyer sentiment in the near term, in our view. despite the challenging near-term outlook, we believe new property sales recovery might gain strength in late-2017. we think the incoming supply of residential property will peak by mid-2017 as many developers have held back their launches since 2015. also, the bulk of the property projects that were launched before 2015 would be completed by the end of this year. the peaking of incoming supply could mark the beginning of easing competition among developers and existing homeowners for property sales. still, we think property share prices appear toppish in the near term as property sales could remain weak in the next few months. we believe that the property market conditions need to improve significantly compared with those in 2016 to lift the kuala lumpur property index to a significantly higher level. if our expectation of peaking incoming supply by mid-2017 is right, more attractive buying opportunities could emerge in the second half of the year as property stock prices may react positively to the prospects of a trough in the property market. the key

concerns about g20 financial leaders' decision to drop a pledge to keep global trade free and open, according to reuters. the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was flat at 100.32 after touching its lowest since feb. 7 of 100.020. the index extended last week's weakness following recent interest-rate guidance from the u.s. fed that was less hawkish than many had expected, it said. alliancedbs research in its evening edition monday said that led by fridays up close, the fbm klci had on march 20 traded higher to reach the highest high of 1,755.26 since june 1, 2015 as market participants continued to play on the buying side in anticipation of a higher market. it said under the persistent buying interest, the benchmark index was in the green throughout most of the trading sessions before settling at 1,749.41 (up 4.21 points or 0.24%). in the broader market, gainers outnumbered losers with 546 stocks ending higher and 421 stocks

strength exhibited. those market participants that missed out the buying opportunity earlier in the area of 1,700 did not want to be left out. they took the chance to buy into the market hoping to see this market could run higher. however, the buying interest did not carry the market far up after overcoming the 1,753 immediate hurdle as the market has rallied into the selling supply area, it said.

fund managers and analysts are generally still cautious on the sector despite some indicators showing signs of improvement. the traction seen with banking stocks could be due to several reasons, according to the fund managers. firstly, the recovery of commodity prices has reignited confidence among investors, given that many banks are exposed to commodity-related companies. crude oil prices have recovered. this means that banks that have exposure to the oil and gas sector may see fewer provisions from this sector. this has sort of given investors more confidence in banks, says phillip capital management sdn bhd chief investment officer ang kok heng. besides, bank valuations look much cheaper now compared with what they were previously. price-to-book ratios average 1.3 times while the price-earnings ratios average 13 times. however, the fund managers agree that there is not much excitement for the banking sector from the earnings point of view. manulife asset management services bhd head of equities tock chin hui has turned neutral on the sector from being underweight. she says most negatives for banks have been priced in, except for a significant deterioration in asset quality. she adds that with commodity prices on the rebound and brighter prospects globally, she does not see asset quality deteriorating significantly for now. that said, we still find it hard to be bullish on the sector as there is no general improvement in key trends. we expect the operating environment to remain challenging. banks roe (return on equity) has deteriorated from 15% to 16% to the low teens while loan and deposit growth is likely to remain weak. hence, it is challenging to expect valuations to revert to historical levels without any major macro improvement, tock says. as far as the tough operating environment is concerned, ang says the lifeline for banks  loans  has been growing at a slow pace, with no indicator showing an improvement going forward. with loan growth slowing down significantly, the opportunity for better profits diminishes as well. banks are also facing compressed nims (net interest margins) because of stiff competition among peers. its not a very exciting sector now, he says.  improvement in business loans gives promise? while loan growth is a far cry from the double-digit increase seen a few years ago, it is still a relief to see the indicator picking up in january. the latest banking data released by bank negara malaysia shows that loan growth rose to 5.6% year on year at the end of that month, compared with 5.3% at end-december 2016. the improvement came from the business loan segment, which grew 5.4% y-o-y in january, compared with 5% last december. household loans, on the other hand, eased slightly to 5.2% y-o-y from 5.3%. meanwhile, asset quality stabilised at around 1.2% at end-january and loan loss ratio improved marginally to 91.5%, compared with 90.2% last december. however, it may be too soon for cheer as leading indicators like loan applications and approvals contracted 8.4% and 5.1% y-o-y respectively in january. kenanga research opines that the momentum of industry loan growth will likely be subdued this year as banks will continue to be selective about asset quality and strict on approvals. stiff price-based competition may trend upwards this year as the contest for deposits intensifies for excess and longer-term funding. however, better pricing for assets may minimise nim compression. our base-case estimate for the system loan growth for 2017 is between 5% and 5.5%, says the research house. manulifes tock says the upcoming implementation of frs 9 (financial reporting standard 9) by banks is a concern. one of the nagging concerns for the banking sector is the frs 9, which kicks in on jan 1, 2018. frs requires banks to make appropriate provisions in anticipation of potential losses, rather than the current practice of making provisions only when losses are incurred. hence, we expect provisioning to, more likely than not, rise in order to ensure compliance, she says.  defensive banks the way to go the various challenges in the banking sector explain why many are cautious on banking stocks. tock says her strategy remains skewed towards banks with defensive attributes or those that have been restructured recently or have streamlined their operations. ta securities chief investment officer choo swee kee, who is also conservative on banks, says he prefers malayan banking bhd (maybank) because of its good dividend payout, besides the fact that its share price has fallen from its high of above rm10 apiece in 2014. maybanks full-year dividend per share totalled 52 sen in fy2016, giving the stock a yield of close to 6%, based on last fridays share price of rm8.73. its full-year net profit was, however, affected by larger net impairment losses, declining 1% to rm6.74 billion. but net interest income grew to rm11.57 billion from rm11.11 billion a year ago. net impairment losses increased 50% to rm3.02 billion from rm2.01 billion previously. choo says, people view banks as the barometer of a countrys economy. so, if an investor is looking for growth that is in line with the countrys economic growth, he may just have to keep a close eye on the banking sector. so, the question to ask is: what is the outlook for the countrys economy? malaysias economic growth, based on consensus, is between 4% and 4.5%. it is decent growth compared with that of the rest of the world. dbs vickers securities says in a report that the banking sectors valuation has risen marginally so far this year, pricing in the slightly better prospects for the sector. we believe a sustainable rerating will continue to hinge on the dissipation of uncertainties over asset quality, loan growth and net interest margins, it says. the research house still prefers defensive stocks like public bank bhd and hong leong bank, but has given buy calls to more counters, including bimb holdings bhd and ammb. bimbs upgrade is premised on its superior growth and solid fundamentals while we are more positive on ammb for its potential turnaround, it explains. given that the majority of research houses remain neutral on the sector, most bank stocks could trade sideways unless major surprises arise.

the award for best equity asia-pacific ex-japan (islamic) in the five-year category. ceo munirah khairuddin says the strength of its funds lies in the companys investment philosophy, which is primarily based on a bottom-up stock selection. by doing simple things very well, we can channel our energy to picking the right investments for our funds. this bottom-up focus also allows us to develop unique insights and thought leadership in our top-down analysis and macro views. she adds that the funds portfolios are constructed and managed to deliver benchmark-agnostic, high-alpha and absolute-return profiles. in other words, we do not spend time trying to lose less money on index stocks. we spend most of our time figuring out how to have portfolios that limit downside risks when we are wrong and make good returns when we are right. on the performance of the financial markets last year, munirah says although equities started off weak at the beginning of the year due to oil prices hitting multi-year lows, it began to recover when oil prices rebounded and the energy market stabilised. in the middle of the year, the brexit vote caused a brief flight to quality. but it was the unexpected us presidential election results that moved equity prices higher. we were generally neutral on both conventional and islamic asian equities, noting that earnings revisions were mostly negative. however, we did see inertia for a slow grind upwards for markets, such as fund inflows, economic reforms, fiscal stimulus and low interest rates, she says. despite the challenging local and global economic trends last year, the fund house recorded a notable increase in its assets under management (aum). its aum grew 7.6% year on year to rm67.6 billion for the year ended dec 31, 2016. munirah attributes the growth to its strategic and diversified asset allocation approach in the right markets, global experience, technical expertise and innovative products. this year, cimb-principal expects the global economy to recover  firmer and broader than in previous years. the us economy could see support from infrastructure spending, corporate and personal tax cuts, income tax credits, financial market reforms and investments in energy. european economies are seeing slow and steady growth while japans economy will benefit from a moderate recovery in personal consumption, says munirah. uncertainties in the financial markets are expected to centre on us president donald trumps policy direction, outcomes in the heavy political election calendar in europe and chinas economic growth agenda and plans for debt deleveraging. in particular, trumps success or failure in the early days of his administration to push through tax reforms, repeal obamacare and review the dodd-frank act will be closely watched as an indicator of the development of other sensitive issues such as trade, immigration and fiscal spending, says munirah. this year, cimb-principal will focus on finding the right bottom-up investments for its funds and its portfolios will remain fully invested and defensively positioned. it will also focus on finding new growth opportunities and gear its research towards identifying beneficiaries of the fourth industrial revolution  primarily in the it sector and areas such as the sharing economy, energy storage and automation. in terms of sectors, the fund house is overweight on china internet and technology as it expects the sector to grow at a healthy rate, having the potential to penetrate more deeply across major sectors of the economy. it also likes the financial and industrial sectors as rising interest rates tend to indicate stronger economic conditions. meanwhile, cimb-principal is underweight on telecommunications and utilities as these sectors are normally capital intensive and carry large debts on their balance sheets. the fund houses earnings per share forecast for the asia-pacific ex-japan market is an increase of 10% year on year. this is supported by decent nominal gdp growth of about 6% and a low base in 2016. therefore, we think it is reasonable for investors to expect a return of 6% to 8% this year. however, our enthusiasm may be tempered by expectations of a stronger us dollar, potential geopolitical developments such as european elections, and trade disputes between the us and china, says munirah.  by

exerted heavy pressures on malakoff bhds share price, which dipped to an all-time low of rm1.17 last friday. the countrys third largest independent power producer (ipp), in terms of capacity, is currently trading 35% below its initial public offer price of rm1.80. malakoff was relisted on bursa malaysia in may 2015. malakoffs share price has been on downhill since october last year after it had hovered at around rm1.60 most part of the year. this is rather a contrast to the traditional belief that utilities companies, such as ipp, is one that investors would want to seek shelter when economic weather turns harsh simply because of clear earnings visibility and resilience in nature. the current share price sits 18% below the consensus 12-month target price of rm1.43, which is based on estimates by 18 out of 20 analysts. does this make the stock an attractive pick? some analysts concur that the stock starts appearing attractive, in terms of valuation, after the recent fall. still, not every analyst is quick to recommend it yet. if you look broadly, most of [malakoffs] peers  tnb (tenaga nasional bhd), petronas gas bhd and gas malaysia bhd  have been showing better, if not more stable, earnings, an analyst told the edge financial daily. malakoff announced last week that its net profit shrank 15% to rm90.23 million, or 1.8 sen a share, for the fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2016 (4qfy16) against rm106.17 million or 2.12 sen per share, a year ago. the ipp has warned in the result note that the power purchase agreement (ppa) for the segari energy venture (sev) power plant would expire in june. the ppa is the sweetheart deal for malakoff given the favourable terms, including the take or pay clause, in the agreement. the expiry has weighed on its earnings prospects, and on top of that the ipp has not been able to secure new project so far. although it signed a new 10-year ppa for the power plant, analysts who track the stock have cut malakoffs earnings estimates for the financial year ending dec 31, 2018 (fy18) and fy19 amid expectation of reductions in capacity payments under the new ppa. kenanga research, which forecasts a 50% decline in capacity payments, slashes its earnings forecast for fy18 by 23%. meanwhile, earnings contribution from its tanjung bin power plant, which commenced operations in march 2016, is expected to be minimal despite management guidance that the plant will turn profitable within this year, said cimb research analyst saw xiao jun. with an effective capacity of 1,890mw, tanjung bin is currently malakoffs biggest power plant followed by the sev plant with an effective capacity of 1,221.6mw. there is a possibility of lower capacity payment for tanjung bin in fy17 given that [it] has breached its second threshold for unscheduled outage rate of 8%, said ta analyst kylie chan. chan projected that gains from the coal-fired plant would be offset by higher downtime scheduled in march for rectification works, and higher interest costs of the plant following debt refinancing, among others. in addition, management guided for higher total scheduled outage in fy17, she wrote in the latest financial result review. the weak earnings may make malakoff less generous on dividend payment. it declares a dividend of seven sen per share for fy16, which translates into 98.5% of its annual earnings per share of 7.11 sen. malakoff currently boasts a 12-month dividend yield of 4.55%; it is almost two times the 2.37% dividend yield of tnb. however, assuming the share price remains constant, it faces limited upside as earnings visibility remains weak. if they maintain the [dividend payout ratio] at 70% to 80%, it will be a concern to investors [since the] management expects earnings in fy17 and fy18 to be lower, said an analyst who declined to be named. it was likely, however, that malakoff would at least try to maintain the seven sen per share dividend, she told the edge financial daily over the phone. the company said that it wants to continue to grow its capacity, so it has to make a choice  [they have to find] a balance between the need to finance new expansion and maintain the dividend, saw said. that said, some quarters observe that investors risk appetite has grown of late. apart from having tnb as a staple in their portfolio given it is a component stock of the benchmark fbm klci, investors may not be counting energy producers among their top picks when the economic growth prospects get brighter."}, "189": {"date_posted": "22/2/2017", "title": "warrants update: lbs

houses top picks among malaysian developers. we spoke to the management for an update. work has been progressing well at the start of 2017 and we believe that the potential rerating catalysts for lbs

a good share price performance, he adds. ml global is the listed construction arm of lbs. lbs strong pipeline of new launches could provide sustainable job awards to its 56%-owned subsidiary and

accounted for 90% of the traded volume at prices between s$1.825 and s$1.840 a share. this resulted in a \"trade with caution\" alert being placed on the stock on feb 5 last year, which triggered a 29% crash in the price. mr lim kok tong was also a founding member of zhongmin baihui, which was incorporated here in 2004. after the company listed in 2011, more than 100 employees and company

planning for fleet growth, which will drive seat capacity growth and lower ticket pricing, potentially stimulating traffic. meanwhile, chinese visitors grew 27% year-on-year during first 10 months of 2016 and will likely grow further in 2017f with the continuation of visa-free travel and the weak ringgit. we are forecasting 9.3% traffic growth in fy17 against 6% growth in fy16. mavcom hinted during an analyst briefing on oct 31, 2016 that it may approve a hike in malaysian airport landing charges in 2018f. by comparison, thai and indonesian landing charges are about 60% higher than in malaysia, while hong kong and singapore recently increased their landing charges. we have reflected our best-guess estimate of a 30% rise in mahbs landing charges from jan 1, 2018f. mahb has been negotiating with the finance ministry for several years on the extension of its malaysian concession. the concession was set for 25 years from 2009 to 2034, but mahb is negotiating for a further 35-year extension to 2069. mahbs current share price reflects none of the valuation upside that might arise with the extension of the concession, in our view. hence, we believe a successful extension represents pure upside to mahbs valuation and stock price from current levels. as a result of the above catalysts, we are upgrading our rating to an add, with a higher tp of rm8.40. we have incorporated only half of the value of the potential concession extension and factored in a valuation of istanbul sabiha gokcen (isg) that is 30% below mahbs cost of investment. assuming that the malaysian concession is not extended, we think mahb is worth rm6.42 per share, which is higher than the current share price. as such, there is limited downside in our view; conversely, there is at least 34% upside to our target. isg recently suffered from weak international travel demand due to political and terrorist incidents, we have reflected very low passenger traffic growth expectations in all forecast years so as to draw a baseline, from which we believe there is a much greater risk of upside than downside in our valuations.  cimb research, jan 25   "}, "200": {"date_posted":

surrounding vaping subsides, the road ahead still seems far from clear, said analysts. the declining cigarette consumption per capita, continued high illicit trades and regulatory risks suggest that the landscape for tobacco players will only get tougher next year, said alliancedbs investment bank vice-president of equity cheah king yoong. we remain cautious about the growth prospects in the malaysian tobacco sector for 2017. we believe that the sector landscape is getting increasingly difficult due to the declining cigarette consumption per capita as the population becomes more health-conscious, continued high illicit trades, regulatory risks and the emergence of alternative product offerings such as e-cigarettes, he told the edge financial daily via email. cheah said the legitimate industry volume is set to drop by 22% this year before stabilising in 2017. nevertheless, we believe that regulatory challenges remain the key downside risk to our legitimate industry volume assumptions for 2016 and 2017, he noted. cheah said while there was no announcement on an excise duty hike on tobacco products in budget 2017, there is still the possibility of an off-budget increase. we continue to advise investors to exercise caution, as we do not rule out a post-budget excise duty hike for tobacco companies in the coming months. besides that, we understand that the illegal cigarette trades remain higher at more than 40% (49.9% in may 2016), which could hinder the sectors recovery, he added. in its strategy note dated dec 21, cimb research viewed excise duty hikes as a major challenge affecting the sustainability of the tobacco industry. it has an underweight call on the sector. excise duty hikes of 40% in november 2015 had led to a steep 28.6% decline in legal volumes, while illicit trade volumes currently stand at 49.9% of malaysias total cigarette volumes, it noted. the local tobacco industry had to contend with three rounds of excise duty hikes between 2013 and 2016. tobacco tax rose 14% in september 2013, 12% in november 2014 and 36% in november 2015. in march this year, british american tobacco (m) bhd (bat)  the only listed tobacco company in malaysia  decided to shut down its plant in malaysia, citing the high excise environment, which ultimately led to the sharp rise in illegal cigarettes and significantly lower legal sales volumes, and resulted in rising cigarette production costs. judging from the second quarter industry sales trend, uob kay hian head of research for malaysia vincent khoo said there are clear signs the decline in demand and consumer downtrading to cheaper brands are bottoming out. however, the research house has not seen any meaningful recovery yet. but its not all bad for the tobacco industry. khoo expects a less harsh regulatory environment in the new year and does not foresee further excise duty hikes on tobacco products. the good thing is that we continue to expect a less harsh regulatory environment. for example, we do not foresee further punitive duty hikes on tobacco products as the last duty increase was counterproductive to the overall tax collection for the tobacco industry and led to [the] high level of illicit trade, he told the edge financial daily in an email reply. once dubbed a multimillion-ringgit industry, vaping no longer poses a threat to tobacco companies as the earlier fad seems to have faded, said khoo. we believe that smoking would be stable from here on and substitute products would not have a wide appeal to smokers preference for taste and flavour, he said. in may, malaysian e-vaporizers and tobacco alternative association (mevta) founder and adviser allan foo was quoted as saying that the reduced adoption of vaping by malaysians could be due to it being just a passing trend. the number of vapers and vape retail outlets nationwide has also dwindled. still, cheah warns that the increasing popularity of other product offerings such as e-cigarettes pose a new challenge to the industry. meanwhile, bat posted a 17% drop in net profit for the third quarter ended sept 30, 2016 (3qfy16) to rm212.62 million from rm256.1 million a year ago. revenue declined 19.6% to rm932.19 million in 3qfy16 from rm1.16 billion in 3qfy15. for the nine-month period ended sept 30, 2016 (9mfy16), its net profit fell 39.6% to rm432.95 million from rm717.18 million due to overall volume reduction and escalating cost pressures. revenue fell 17% to rm2.92 billion from rm3.52 billion in 9mfy15. we are expecting a mid-single-digit earnings growth [in 2017], driven by cost-efficiency and modest volume recovery. we reckon that the consumption decline of duty-paid cigarettes has bottomed out in the second quarter of 2016, said khoo, who tracks bat. he pointed out that bats prospective yield stands at 6.3%, after having fallen close to his target price of rm44. the current yield fairly reflects our outlook for extended sluggish consumption and earnings trends. we expect bat to deliver only modest total shareholder returns at the current price, he said. cheah is maintaining a hold call on bat given the increasingly challenging industry outlook. cimb research, which has a reduce call on the counter, said it expects bats cigarette volumes to continue to decline due to weaker overall consumer sentiment and bats more premium portfolio. bats closure of its manufacturing facilities and outsourced production is positive, but benefits are only likely to materialise beginning 2018, it added. year to date, bats share price has declined by 23% to close at rm43.40 yesterday for a market capitalisation of rm12.39 billion. according to bloomberg, four of 18 analysts tracking the stock have a buy call on bat, six a hold call and eight a sell call."},

non-controlling stake by federal land development authority (felda) in indonesias pt eagle high plantations tbk as there would be no unlocking of value for felda. in fact, the us$505.4 million or rm2.26 billion investment should be spent on feldas locally listed arm felda global ventures holdings bhd (fgv). felda is not acquiring a controlling stake in eagle high [and] it cannot effect a mandatory general offer. as a result, felda cannot derive synergy from the buy unlike sime darby bhds acquisition of new britain palm oil ltd (nbpol). since there is no asset [but] only a stake, felda cannot unlock the value from this exercise, an analyst with a local bank, who declined to be quoted, said. the analyst added that the acquisition at us$505.4 million by feldas fic properties sdn bhd (ficp), which is more than double the average share price of eagle high, is a significant premium and therefore too pricey for a loss-making company. the analyst told the edge financial daily via telephone that ficps buy at 580 rupiah (19 sen) per share is expensive and it would take felda a long time before it can reap profits partly because the shares are illiquid. according to eagle highs financial results for [the] first nine months of 2016, it made a loss. the cost of 580 rupiah per share is more than 100% of the average share price. eagle highs share price would have to double before feldas investment can break even. that is the only way i see felda benefiting from the acquisition because it has no control over the management. it might be looking to benefit through dividends with crude palm oil (cpo) price surging beyond rm4,000 per tonne. however, the prospect [of that happening] at this moment is not likely. it will be a long time before felda sees any benefit, the analyst said. last friday, ficp inked a sale and purchase agreement with pt rajawali corp to acquire the stake in jakarta-listed eagle high, which is also one of indonesias largest palm oil companies. eagle high, which is 74.07% owned by pt rajawali, saw net loss widen to rm100 million in its nine months ended sept 30, 2016 (9mfy16) from rm27.4 million last year due to weak fresh fruit bunch (ffb) production and sizeable interest expenses while revenue dipped 22.5% to rm532.7 million compared with rm685.8 million in 9mfy15. according to filings with the indonesia stock exchange, the company suffered a net loss of rm60 million on higher revenue of about rm900 million in its financial year ended dec 31, 2015 (fy15) versus rm63.1 million net loss and rm765.7 million revenue in fy14. asked if the acquisition constituted a bad call, the analyst said the question should instead be why felda was desperate to buy a stake in eagle high. the investment by felda was better spent on fgv which has a lower enterprise value per hectare (ev/ha). this is a decision made by a government entity [so] they must justify the desperate need for this acquisition, the analyst said. to recap, in a seven-point frequently asked questions (faqs) response last friday, felda said the deal will improve feldas crop profile as the average age of eagle highs trees is seven years versus feldas 15 years. there would be a lot of collaborations and cross-selling between felda and eagle high. potential new businesses and synergies for felda group in seedling, fertiliser, crude palm oil trading, downstream/oleochemical, and potential entry to the vast indonesian market of 260 million people for felda groups finished and consumer products, felda said. meanwhile, pt rhb securities indonesia analyst hariyanto wijaya opined that feldas acquisition price at 580 rupiah per share versus the current price of 298 rupiah and potential earnings recovery could be a catalyst for unlocking eagle highs share price. we met with its investor relations personnel last week and the management estimates its ffb production in the fourth quarter of 2016 (4q16) and fy17 to grow by 12% year-on-year (y-o-y) and 30% y-o-y, respectively. they also guided on continued production recovery since september, and that the current cpo price level should enable eagle high to book positive earnings in 4q16. we do not have a rating on the stock. at current ev/ha of us$10,069, it is trading at the lower range of our plantations universe, he said in a sector note on tuesday. hariyanto added that in 2016, about 73,167ha or 64.5% of eagle highs nucleus matured plantation of 113,432ha was in the increasing ffb yield phase (aged four to eight years). the alleged expensive acquisition has been the subject of controversy among several quarters including cimb group holdings bhd chairman datuk seri nazir razak, opposition politicians and researchers. among their criticisms, they claim that felda should not validate the soundness of the purchase on the basis of ev/ha as it did not own a controlling shareholding in eagle high. pkr policymaker mohd rafizi ramli told a press conference yesterday that felda was using ev/ha justification on the basis of how much value one can get from planted acreage. felda reasoned that it is almost impossible to find huge acreage of that size in indonesia because nobody is going to sell. now, firstly, you are not in control of eagle high plantations, felda plans to buy a 37% stake at exorbitant price, yet at the same time it does not have the controlling stake. when you dont have a controlling stake, it is rather ridiculous to have access to huge acreage of plantation. value can only be added when there is synergy through a controlling stake, he said. according to reports, pt rajawali founder peter sondakh will retain a controlling stake in eagle high. in its faqs response, felda stated kuala lumpur kepong bhds recent final offer of us$15,500 ev/ha rejected by mp evans group plcs board of directors was valued by mp evans independent valuers as us$17,300 ev/ha. mp evans asked for valuation of us$24,000 ev/ha for the company. [however,] at us$505.4 million, felda is purchasing the eagle high stake at us$16,000 ev/ha, felda said, adding that mp evans planted land is 31,400ha while eagle highs planted area is 125,000ha. felda is purchasing access to land four times the size of mp evans at a lower ev/ha than mp evans independent valuation, felda said while noting that sime darbys purchase of nbpol was at an ev/ha of us$27,000. to this, mohd rafizi said felda should talk about the synergistic value it can get from the acquisition that can put it or fgv in a game-changing position against its competitors. buying 37% at that exorbitant price and not even able to consolidate eagle highs results into felda, is just madness. so what will happen is felda will continue to show a weak balance sheet, so it is pointless to talk about the ev[/ha] because you cant consolidate. similar to what is happening now where felda can only take dividend [although] its top results and balance sheet are still weak but with additional rm2 billion debt [due to the acquisition], with no result to show apart from the dividend every now and then. therefore, dont even begin talking about ev[/ha] because it is only relevant when you have control to do with all those acreage you get, he said. meanwhile, bernama has reported that feldas decision to acquire a stake in eagle high was vital to its progress as it had reached a stage where it needed to reinvent itself after six decades in the industry. felda director-general of management muzamil mohd nor said failing to do this would mean felda would remain stagnant, while others in the global palm oil sector were moving forward. expounding the rationale behind the transformative deal, muzamil said the deal was strategically too important to pass up as it would make felda one of the biggest global palm oil plantation companies. if we dont do this deal, we will just be on the sidelines, being forced to watch our competitors grow by leaps and bounds in this highly lucrative sector, he said in an interview yesterday."}, "210": {"date_posted": "28/12/2016", "title": "ipo round-up 2016: prolonged drought on bursa", "article": "  the unfavourable economic climate and other factors, such as the rising number of malaysian companies seeking listing abroad, have hit bursa malaysias initial public offering (ipo) activities hard. some rm596.6 million was raised from ipos this year  which is barely 14% of the sum raised in 2015. according to bursa, the companies had raised rm4.35 billion in 2015 and rm3.94 billion in 2014 through ipos. the number of ipos this year is the same as last year at 11  the lowest since 1989, when there were 13 ipos. there was only six ipos in 1988. the absence of mega ipos, such as from government-linked corporations (glc), is a key contributing factor to the sharp decline in the proceeds raised via ipos. the record year for ipo was 2012 when rm22.94 billion was raised from the listing of felda global ventures holdings bhd, ihh healthcare bhd and astro malaysia holdings bhd. ihh was the world third largest ipo in 2012. after the sharp drop of 64.21% year on year in 2013, proceeds raised through ipos continued to fall in the last three years. this year, four companies were listed on the ace market, and four on the main market. according to bursa, there will be two more listings, namely rhone ma holdings bhd and foundpac group bhd, on the main market before the year ends. rhone ma is expected to make its debut on dec 19. the animal health solutions provider has raised about rm31.59 million. the ipo, which offers 42.12 million shares of 50 sen each, was over-subscribed 22.46 times. foundpac group bhd, a semiconductor manufacturer scheduled to be listed on dec 29, is offering 40 million shares at 54 sen apiece, which will raise about rm21.6 million. the ipo activities, however, were in line with regional performance, according to industry observers. this year was one of the slowest for ipos. the market was slowing down across the whole region. there were not many activities because the overall market [sentiment] has been volatile. a lot of industries are risk off. it is really not easy, cimbs private banking head carolyn leng tells the edge. there were fewer ipos this year than in the previous years. this could be attributed to the generally weaker investor sentiment on the local bourse, which resulted in some companies opting to defer their listings to next year. regionally, we are also seeing fewer ipo deals than in 2015, rhb investment bank bhds equity capital markets director and regional head, gan kim khoon, tells the edge in an email, adding that these ipos were mainly lacklustre, except for a few. for instance, eco world international bhd, which planned to list this year, has to delay it to next year. according to the ey global ipo trends report, the economic slowdown, especially in china, continues to affect asean business confidence and gdp growth, which is acting as a brake on ipos. the slowdown is exacerbated by ongoing commodity price fluctuations and political developments. for instance, on the philippine stock exchange, there were no ipos in the third quarter of this year. the uncertainty of the ringgit and the trump effect may continue to suppress the ipos in the first half of 2017, although the overall sentiment next year is expected to be better than 2016. for the first half, i think the market will still be digesting what had happened, such as the impact of the newly-elected us president donald trump on asia, and also the weakening ringgit, says cimbs leng. she foresees the ipo sentiment to improve in the second half when the market is more certain. according to the securities commission malaysia, other than eco world international, companies seeking listing include oil and gas services company serba dinamik holdings bhd, construction company advancecon holdings bhd, leading tyre retread compounds manufacturer eversafe rubber bhd, engineering services provider inta bina group bhd, building management solutions provider cabnet holdings bhd, and plantation company matang bhd. overall, rhbs gan expects more and larger ipos (in terms of market capitalisation) next year. ipos that are optimally priced should generally do well, and companies that are in preferred sectors such as plantations, food and beverage and export-oriented industries should also do well, he adds. gan also takes note of the challenges bursa malaysia will face in the new year. he points out that there are not many large privately-owned companies with good business models and market dominance left for listing. so there is a need for bursa malaysia to attract foreign companies. while our market has the right regulatory and governance environment, we do not have the depth in terms of liquidity [volume] to attract some of these foreign companies [for listing], he says.

to close 2016 at a third straight yearly loss this year  a contrast to the dow jones industrial average, which is charting new all-time highs. sure, with brent crude oil prices staying above us$50 a barrel, the local bellwether indices might have a chance to beat end-2015s 1,692.51-point and 11,793-point closes respectively the coming fortnight. so far, though, the indices only managed to stay above their respective end-2015 level for two months this year. even the fbm small cap index, which ended 6% higher year on year in 2015, was down 9.1% year to date as at dec 13. the tough environment, notwithstanding, a number of equity analysts tracking malaysian stocks managed to find a number of money-making picks for clients. some analysts stuck their neck out by making a sell recommendation or a contrarian buy that showed prescience. the 10 winners in the 11th edition of the edges best call awards 2016 were selected from 86 recommendations for 75 stocks received. while the number of nominations was smaller than last years 139 submissions for 102 stocks, we received submissions from 14 research houses this year. this was despite the absence of two research houses, which are usual participants but underwent significant personnel movements this year. most nominations still came from heads of research and the analysts themselves. we even received nominations from a blogger and a retail investor, detailing how they made money from picking their own stocks. we thank them for their interest, but regret to say that we are not able to independently measure and verify them the same way we do calls made by licensed equity analysts that are nominated. like last year, we made allowances for calls made in 2015 that proved right this year, provided that the same analyst did not first cause clients to lose money, thus negating gains when proven right more than a year on. the results are our best-effort attempt to recognise good fundamental stock analysis and its importance in making investment decisions, largely based on submissions and publicly available data. feedback on the methodology is welcomed at [emailprotected]. like last year, we included several stock picks by asia analytica sdn bhd, or better known as insiderasia, which performed well in 2016. while insiderasia is not a part of the edge media group, a decision was made to exclude it from the awards due to our working relations. with that, here are this years 10 winners in no particular order. congratulations to the winners. to the good stock pickers who slipped under our radar, keep up the good work. merry christmas and a happy new year everyone!  rhb research institute ng sem guans call on hong leong industries bhd hong leong industries bhd (hli) is not among tan sri quek leng chans sexier equity holdings  up until about three years back. rhb research institutes ng sem guan noticed the low-profile stock, though, and in a non-rated note in february 2014 highlighted it to clients  rightly calling hli a growing dragon that is spurred by growth at its consumer (yamaha motorcycle franchise in malaysia and vietnam) and industrial products divisions. hli had then just spun off hume industries bhd. for this award, we only counted hlis gains from aug 3, 2015, when rhb initiated coverage with a buy, with a rm7.22 target price when it fetched rm5.28. incidentally, hli was queried for unusual market activity (uma) on aug 3, 2015, after trading volume jumped significantly. the counter went on to reach rm9.93 on nov 30, 2016. hli paid 57 sen dividends in august 2015 (44 sen in 2016 alone), bringing total returns to over 80%. rhb reiterated a buy on nov 9 with a rm10.60 target price, noting that hli continues to generate decent earnings from its vietnam associate and higher industrial products exports. hlis net cash position and cash-generation ability should allow it to pay out 50% of its earnings, implying a yield of over 4%, ng said. key downside risks include us dollar weakness dampening export sales. our records show uob kay hian research also upgraded hli to a buy, with a higher target price on aug 3, 2015, although this is not reflected on bloomberg. uob cut hli to hold on aug 19 this year, with a rm8.40 target price, but hli largely stayed above rm9 since.  rhb research institute ng sem guans call on press metal bhd many might not realise that press metal is the largest integrated aluminium producer in southeast asia with a smelting capacity of 760,000 tonnes and extrusion capacity of 190,000 tonnes per annum. in fact, the company commands 1.5% of the global primary aluminium capacity with costs in the first quartile of the global production cost curve, making it a cost-efficient producer. so, when press metals phase ii aluminium smelter in samalaju resumed normal operations (post a quiet period after a fire incident in may 2015), rhb research institutes ng sem guan on march 14 this year upgraded the stock from neutral (rm2.19 target price) to buy with a rm3.56 target price, implying a 40% upside potential back then. press metal became rhbs new top pick for the basic materials sector. at the time, press metal fetched rm2.54 (adjusted to 90.71 sen for a two-for-one stock split and 40% bonus issue), but has appreciated 87.4% in the past 10 months and closed at rm1.70 on dec 13. it is worth noting that press metal had in the past two years rewarded shareholders with dividend every quarter, up from twice a year before that. at the time of writing, rhb still had a buy recommendation and rm2.25 target price, implying a 32% upside potential. whether or not he will continue to be right, bloomberg data ranks ngs call ahead of the only other research house actively tracking press metal, namely kenanga research with a rm1.79 target price. risks to ngs forecast include lower aluminium prices and unexpected production disruptions.  hong leong investment bank research jeremy gohs call on george kent malaysia bhd when initiating coverage on george kent malaysia bhd with a buy call on aug 2 this year, hong leong investment bank researchs jeremy goh told clients that the water metering-turn-engineering company had a rm5.1 billion engineering order book and can no longer be ignored as a formidable force in the engineering industry. according to him, george kent was an under-researched stock that was under-owned by institutional investors. its engineering segment contributes 80% to its top line from just 23% seven years ago, owing to the big break in august 2012 when it secured the rm1.1 billion system works for the ampang lrt extension (17.7km from sri petaling to putra heights)  its first rail-related job. in september 2015, the companys 50:50 joint venture with malaysian resources corp bhd (mrcb) beat five other consortiums to become the project delivery partner for the proposed lrt3 worth rm9 billion in september 2015. with a 58% upside potential to gohs rm3.23 target price, george kent was the top small cap pick in the construction sector. if investors bought the stock at rm2.04 (adjusted to rm1.632 for a 25% bonus issue) on aug 2, total returns over four-plus months would have been 81% as at dec 13s rm2.96 close or 87% at its recent high of rm3.05 on nov 22. a local fund manager, who also nominated this call for the edge best call awards 2016, said gains were close to 60% when the fund took profit. at the time of writing, goh was still the only analyst actively tracking george kent, calling it a key rail play with exposure to the lrt extension, lrt3 and mrt2 while also having solid financials and a sizeable net cash position. his rm3.77 target price implied a 27% upside potential at the time of writing.  affin hwang capital research aaron kees call on aemulus holdings bhd investors would have been spared a sharp 62.5% decline as aemulus holdings bhds shares plummeted to 16.5 sen on dec 13 over 10 months from 44 sen on feb 15, 2016, if they had sold the stock when affin hwang capital researchs aaron kee downgraded the stock to sell and warned of non-delivery of earnings on dwindling orders and escalating operating costs. the downgrade followed a surprise rm1.7 million core net loss amid a sharp 69% plunge in revenue for the first quarter of the financial year ended sept 30, 2016 (fy2016). sales to all countries registered a significant decline u2026 the trend is worrying, particularly for sales to singapore given that it declined from rm8 million in 3qfy2015 to rm53,000 in 1qfy2016, kee said, also taking note of how the bottom line was hit by rm3.7 million fixed administrative costs and the absence of other income. given two consecutive quarters of earnings disappointment, we are concerned over earnings delivery going forward, especially amidst a sector cyclical slowdown, kee said when cutting his target price to 34 sen from 56 sen on feb 15. the same day, cimb research kept an add recommendation while reducing its target price from 70 sen (jan 27) to 60 sen (feb 15). no other analyst actively tracks aemulus, bloomberg data showed at the time of writing. kee currently has a 15 sen target price for aemulus, which implies only a 9.1% downside from current levels while cimb valued the stock at 22 sen as at nov 20.  affin hwang capital research kevin lows call on kesm industries bhd kesm industries bhds shares had already gained 34% when affin hwang capital researchs kevin low initiated coverage on the stock on aug 15 this year with a buy and rm11 target price, implying a 58% upside potential then. according to low, kesm was a good proxy for the stable and growing automotive semiconductor segment, going by growing demand for electronics for vehicles from safety to infotainment and autonomous vehicles. kesm closed at rm6.95 on aug 12. it then jumped 10.5% the day the report was released (aug 15). since then, the counter has reached as high as rm9.90 on dec 6. at its rm9.70 close on dec 13, kesms total returns were nearly 40%. low reiterated his buy call and rm11 target price on nov 25 after kesm reported a 61% year-on- year increase in core profit to rm9.6 million in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending july 31, 2017, on better-than-expected revenue and lower-than-expected tax rate. he expects revenue and earnings to further accelerate in the quarters ahead as kesms expansion in the test business (micro controller units and sensors for automotive idms or ignition diagnostic monitors) filters through. key downside risks include a loss of customers and a reduction in outsourcing opportunities as customers increase their in-house burn-in and test function, he said. other than a non-rated call from ta securities on june 27 with a rm7.75 target price when the stock fetched rm4.96 apiece, no other analyst actively tracks kesm, bloomberg data showed at the time of writing.  inter-pacific research brian yeohs call on jhm consolidation bhd even at its recent high of rm1.65 on nov 28, ace market-listed jhm consolidation bhds market capitalisation of rm204 million meant it is probably too small for most institutional funds. even so, retail investors, for instance, would have benefited from the buy recommendation by inter-pacific researchs brian yeoh. closing at rm1.54 on dec 13, the stock was up 47% over six months from when yeoh initiated coverage on june 10 this year with a rm1.50 target price. while those gains paled when compared with the 231% that the stock gained from as little as 46.5 sen at end-2015, yeoh has the only active coverage on the stock, bloomberg data showed at the time of writing. the 47% gain easily beats the fbm ace index and bursa malaysia technology index that are down 26% and 14.5% year to date (as at dec 13) respectively. on nov 25 this year, yeoh reiterated his buy recommendation with a higher target price of rm2.12. the target price reflects 12 times earnings multiple, being a 20% discount to the 15 times multiple fetched by its peers due to its small market capitalisation. notwithstanding slower automotive sales globally, jhm remains optimistic about prospects of the automotive lights market as led continues to gain traction versus conventional lighting. the company, which is working towards an as9100 certification to qualify as a manufacturer of international aerospace components, is also eyeing a main board transfer by 2018, yeoh said. as it is, rm14.8 million earnings for the nine months ended sept 30, 2016, already exceeds the rm6.5 million booked in fy2015, although its major customer contributing 77% to fy2015 sales is a risk.  bimb securities nurzulaikha azalis call on econpile holdings bhd some investors might be surprised that civil engineering contractor econpile holdings bhd had breached rm1 billion market capitalisation in late october this year when its stock price breached rm1.87 apiece and went on to touch rm2 intraday on nov 1. closing at rm1.85 on dec 13, the stock is still up 74.2% year to date. that still leaves a 9.2% upside potential to the rm2.02 target price ascribed by bimb securities nurzulaikha azali on nov 24. if measured from when she upgraded the stock from hold to buy on feb 13, 2015, however, total returns are 87% with 6.5 sen dividend per share paid in total over the period. at the time, nurzulaikha noted econpiles strong rm500 million outstanding order book and improved margins as reasons for the revised higher earnings projection and target price for the beneficiary of robust construction activities. according to her latest nov 24 note, econpiles outstanding order book stood at rm850 million and will sustain earnings through fy2018. order-book replenishment has also been strong, growing from rm350 million in the financial year ended june 30, 2014 (fy2014) to rm490 million in fy2015 and rm662 million in fy2016. bloomberg data shows nurzulaikha to be the earliest among three analysts tracking the stock and her coverage as the one with the highest returns the past year. her rm2.02 target price reflects 13 times projected fy2017 earnings.  uob kay hian research vincent khoos and fong kah yans call on heineken malaysia bhd brewer heineken malaysia bhd, which has been paying dividends at least twice a year the past decade, has natural appeal as a defensive yield play in the low interest rate environment. so, when uob kay hian researchs vincent khoo and fong kah yan upgraded the company, formerly known as guinness anchor bhd, to buy on jan 20 this year following strong results in the second quarter ended dec 31, 2015, consensus was a resounding buy for the well-tracked stock. between jan 20 and dec 13, total dividend per share was 85 sen. heinekens share price ran 43.6% over seven months from rm12.75 (dividend adjusted) to as high as rm18.30 on aug 16 before retracing 5.9% to rm17.22 on sept 14 when khoo and fong downgraded their call to hold, telling clients that further price appreciation would be limited for brewers amid flattish malt liquor market value, although yield remains attractive. since then, heineken has retraced another 3% and closed at rm16.70 on dec 13. this year is not the first time uobs call on heineken has showed prescience, according to bloomberg, which ranks its call top among peers. its sell call on june 17, 2013, for instance, was near the counters peak of rm18.48 on june 20 that year. from there, the stock skidded 34.3% to rm12.15 on may 12, 2014, when uob upgraded to hold, and thereafter continued to largely trade sideways until the jan 20 upgrade this year. there was a 7.8% upside potential to its rm18 target price from dec 13s rm16.70 close.  alliancedbs research cheah king yoongs call on padini holdings bhd investors who paid attention when alliancedbs researchs cheah king yoong said padini holdings bhd was a fashion trend [thats] not to be missed on aug 11, 2015, would have seen their investment doubled the past 16 months. dividends paid out during the period already totalled 16.5 sen per share. padinis management committed to pay out at least 10 sen dividend per share and cheah rightly highlighted that what was a 7% yield at the time would cushion the impact should the companys earnings not improve after the fourth quarter of the financial year ended june 30, 2015 (fy2015). what if we are wrong? given its strong cash generation and net cash position, we are comfortable that such [dividend] payout is sustainable over the next few years even if earnings growth remains sluggish, cheah wrote in the aug 11 note to tell clients padini deserves a second look. his upgrade to buy also happened when the stock fetched rm1.21 to rm1.23 apiece, near its two-year low of rm1.19 in mid-july last year. to be sure, cheah was not the only one calling a buy on the fashion retailer, but his was the best among submissions received for padini and is among the top three ranked by bloomberg of 12 analysts tracking the stock. cheah had since nov 28 downgraded the stock to hold following uninspiring 1qfy2017 earnings, telling clients that the stock had priced in its near-term growth prospects. furthermore, the weak ringgit might continue to pressure profit margins. closing at rm2.62 on dec 13, the stock is down 0.6% since.  ta securities ooi beng hoois call on gadang holdings bhd its hard to get 40% share price gains in this market, let alone do so within three months. but that was what happened when ta securities ooi beng hooi recommended gadang holdings bhd as an unearthed gem within the construction space on july 19 this year. gadang was trading at seven times fy2016 and fy2017 earnings then and ooi told clients that the company had rm739.5 million outstanding order book as at april this year, providing earnings visibility through may 2018. as gadangs clients are known to be good paymasters, the chances of delay or non-payment from them are greatly reduced, ooi said. at the time, gadang was also looking at developing affordable homes, having acquired land in semenyih. three months later on oct 24, the share price had gained 41% before the company went on to make a bonus issue and two-to-one stock split in mid-november this year. closing at 93 sen on dec 13, gadangs share price had skidded 11% from nov 14s rm1.05 when ooi last reiterated a buy with a rm1.44 target price. nonetheless, the earlier 40% plus gains over three months allow room for the benefit of doubt and a special mention in this years awards. a special mention also goes to jf apex securities, which bloomberg data show to have

of fed members projection of a median of three hikes in 2017 from an anticipated two might prompt bank negara malaysia (bnm) to increase the overnight policy rate (opr) here to offset the impact. the

down at 35.8, chinese yuan slid to 6.9381 and the japanese yen fell to 118.42. the rate hike is the second after december 2015 when the federal open market committee (fomc) chair janet yellen announced a 0.25% rise from near-zero levels since 2006. investors have been aware of the rate hike since the start of 2016 when two hikes were anticipated, with markets correcting when the fomc met. there will not be much difference to the ringgit because the market has priced in the rate hike 100% but now we have to see going forward. i think the market is looking at higher rates. while it is no surprise that the dollar climbed favourably, the saving factor for the ringgit would be crude oil prices to offset the dollar, said inter pacific securities sdn bhd research head pong teng siew. at

index. he said the window dressing by the market is often conducted in the beginning of december, or in mid-december as has been the case from 2011. last year, we saw window dressing being done for small-cap stocks. it is still possible to see a firmer stock performance in the coming weeks, he added. he said while the market had fully factored in yesterdays increase, the strength to withstand ensuing rate hikes is questionable. this would start to cost the capital for equities, and that could dampen interest in the stock market. the narrative on stocks has changed from keeping interest low or zero is good for the market to the opposite which says rate hikes are good for the market. if it is too high, obviously it would hurt the economy, even for the us. it will hurt massive debt levels in the long run. i am not sure where the pain threshold that can put a stop to that is, or what sort of interest rate would destroy the economy, he said. rhb research institute chief asean economist peck boon soon said the impending hikes in 2017 might bring the feds target rate to 1.5% compared with malaysias opr of 3%. however, there is a gap of 1.5% u2026 investors would adjust this. so there would be those [investors] who want to pull out [of malaysia], but there would also be investors who find the gap favourable due to the weak ringgit. we might be seeing a two-way flow [in investment] as a result because the ringgit is expected to remain weak for the time being, he told the edge financial daily. cimb investment bank economics research head michelle chia said markets have gradually been pricing in the us interest rate hikes as observed in the steepening of the us yield curves over the past month. guidance from the federal reserve for three hikes was more hawkish than the market was expecting, hence the broad us dollar strength and weakness in emerging markets currencies, including the ringgit. bank negara has sufficient depth in its policy toolkit to manage the fluctuation in capital flows, reinforced by the measures announced in recent weeks to steady the ringgit. malaysias economy is well placed to weather a rise in short-term volatility due to the stability of domestic demand, chia added in an email reply. jupiter securities chief market strategist benny lee said as long as the ringgit weakens, there would be continuous fund outflows, but the impact on the economy is rather minimal as it is more domestically driven. however, we are seeing chinese investments and that should buffer the negative impact. i dont think the ringgit would be really weak as this would create a market that is undervalued and foreign investors may flock in again. [but] if bank negara does not increase interest rates by june, we may see the ringgit hitting 4.70 against the dollar, he told the edge financial daily via telephone. lee opined that bnm would raise the opr and that inflation could creep in with the weak local currency and stronger dollar, boosting commodity prices. this would not bode well with the equity market which normally has a negative correlation with interest rates. in the longer term, there will be opportunities when markets fall into a correction. the cheaper ringgit would provide great value for foreign institutions but we might not see this in the next half-year, lee said when asked about the impact anticipated from the additional rate hikes in the us. echoing lee, the midf economist said foreign investors would gradually rebalance their portfolios, inadvertently keeping the dollar at its current elevated level. however, that would result in imported inflation into malaysia, he said, adding that at the same time, the higher cost of funds from the rising fed fund rate could potentially affect investment activity globally which as it is, is already at a low level."}, "215": {"date_posted": "14/12/2016", "title": "warrants update: sign-wa trading at rich premiums", "article": "  with its fortunes somewhat linked to the soft property market, kitchen and wardrobe maker signature international bhds shares have fallen about one-fifth from their recent high of rm1.04 on june 3. closing at 82 sen last tuesday, signatures share price was still about 13% above its 52-week low of 72.5 sen on jan 21. nonetheless, cimb research and ta securities, which track the stock, reckon it can do a lot better. according to bloomberg data, they have pegged their target prices for signature at rm1.30 and rm1.26, respectively  suggesting over 50% upside potential from current levels. ta, in a nov 22 note, released when signature fetched 82 sen, reckons that investors had not factored in the companys net excess cash of 20 sen per share (about rm47 million or 24% its market capitalisation) that could be paid out as a special dividend or used for a share buyback. dividend payments, should it happen, benefit shareholders and not warrant holders, unless the warrants are converted into ordinary shares. it is worth noting that signature warrants, sign-wa, which listed late april this year, fetched a 22% to 53% premium to the underlying stock. closing at 25 sen last tuesday, sign-wa fetched a 49% premium to the mother share, which ended at 82 sen. sign-wa, which has a one-to-one conversion ratio and 97 sen strike price, has more than four years to run before expiring on april 21, 2021. nonetheless, it remains to be seen if the warrant can continue to command such a rich premium to the underlying securities. if signature rises 54% to reach tas rm1.26 target price, sign-wa should theoretically be worth 29 sen, only 16% above last tuesdays 25 sen close, assuming zero premium to the underlying stock. if a 50% premium is sustainable, the warrant would command 92 sen or 268% more. a 20% premium would put the warrant at 54.2 sen if the underlying stock can fetch rm1.26. in the nov 22 note, ta says signatures earnings visibility is well-supported by its order book, which surged to rm215 million as at end-september from rm150 million six months earlier. as far as contract flow is concerned, the research house says the current soft property market at home had a mild impact on signature and even opened up new opportunities as some developers bundle free kitchens and wardrobes to entice buyers. meanwhile, cimb says signatures potential collaboration with bank rakyat for the lender to provide personal loans to customers wishing to buy its products could also help boost retail sales.

largely premised on the cheap valuations of property developer stocks where we think further asset price deflation have been priced in, say cimb analyst lock mun yee in monday report. according to lock, property stocks are trading at close to 42% discount to revalued net asset valuation (rnav).  going into 2017, we believe that developers would continue to remain range bound, as rising global uncertainties and prospect of higher interest rates would likely have a negative impact on employment and affordability, says lock. stock price performance is expected to be dragged by supply in 2017

medical treatment costs compiled by cimb, treatment costs in malaysia and thailand are about 50% lower than in singapore, while thai hospitals are more renowned for elective surgeries versus non-elective surgeries offered by singapores medical institutions.  this could explain why medical tourism can no longer be considered a growth driver of singapores healthcare sector today. on patient volumes, we see growth coming mostly from domestic patients. weak medical tourism numbers into singapore are well known and the entire industry was impacted, says cimb analyst jonathan seow in a monday report. despite this observation, seow does not see a broad-based decline in medical tourism numbers, as he believes singapores healthcare sector has built up its expertise in centres of excellence and higher intensity non-elective procedures, for which demand is relatively more resilient compared to elective procedures. on the bright side, the analyst anticipates increased domestic volumes which are partially driven by higher insurance coverage, given how singapores integrated shield plan (ip) insurance coverage has increased significantly to now cover two thirds of the resident population. this change has coincided with private inpatient admissions outpacing public admissions compared to 2015 u2013 a trend which seow thinks is likely to continue. while the aggressive expansion plans of private healthcare players also translated to an inevitable drag on margins and profitability, we note that share price performance appears to be insular to underlying earnings and very resilient to earnings cuts, he adds. in seows opinion, the healthcare industrys absolute stock price performance appears to be more driven by events such as new expansion plans, as well as mergers and acquisitions (m&a). the analyst believes this is especially true for small/mid-cap players such as singapore medical group (smg), singapore o&g, and healthcare management international

only a final dividend during its 4qfy16 results announcement. mah sing sold rm632 million worth of properties in 3qfy16, bringing its cumulative nine months period of fy16 (9mfy16) sales to rm1.4 billion. sales rebounded strongly in 3qfy16 as they improved 75% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q). however, the recovery was insufficient to make up for the lull in the first half of fy16. the group cut its full-year sales target by 22% to rm1.8 billion from rm2.3 billion. based on the revised target, it now expects 4qfy16 sales to decline by almost 40% q-o-q to only rm400 million and full-year sales to decline 22%. as at september 2016, mah sings unbilled sales stood at rm4 billion, 6% down q-o-q. mah sings rm1.4 billion sales in 9mfy16 were still commendable as it launched only rm984 million worth

near-term sales. including dividend, the return on the stock has outperformed that of the fbm klci by 10% year to date. we downgrade the stock to hold as the weak sales outlook in the near term could cap its share price upside. our target revised net asset value discount for mah sing is now 30%, larger than the 20% discount attached to eco world development group bhd (ecoworld) and uoa development bhds valuations as we believe these two peers are on track to beating their fy15 sales. the key upside or downside risks to our call are better- or weaker-than-expected sales. there is a pause in sales recovery in which most developers that we cover are expected to deliver strong q-o-q sales growth in 3qfy16, driven by more new launches for the mass-market homebuyers. however, the recent turn of events, ranging from uncertainties about us economic policies and the volatile exchange rate movements, would have a negative impact on homebuyers sentiments. we believe that mass-market housing will continue to be the focus of most developers in 2017. those that have lined up major launches of mass-market housing projects for next year, in our view, offer the highest chance of sustaining, if not beating, their 2016 sales in 2017. in our coverage, these developers are ecoworld (ecw mk, add, tp: rm1.75) and lbs bina group bhd (lbs mk, add, tp: rm2.15).  cimb investment research, nov 27"},

"16/11/2016", "title": "new stakeholder emerges in toyo ink ", "article": "  after a series of acquisitions over the past two months, privately held pembinaan maju wangi sdn bhd has accumulated almost 12.16 million shares, or an 11.36% stake, in toyo ink group bhd. this makes it the second largest shareholder after bangsar-based property group eng lian enterprise sdn bhd, which has 15.4% equity interest. the latest changes in shareholding have raised questions as to whether the new stakeholder will help to expedite the companys power-generation project in vietnam. there is little or no information about pembinaan maju wangi or the individuals behind it, what their plans are, whether they are politically connected and whether they have the requisite funds to support toyo inks plans, says one market watcher. pembinaan maju wangi is entering toyo ink at a time when it is likely to need fresh capital to embark on the power project, which is estimated to cost us$3.5 billion. toyo ink had secured a deal in 2008 with power engineering consulting joint stock company 2, under the ministry of industry of vietnam, to build a 2,000mw coal-fired power plant in hau giang in south vietnam. the plan is to supply energy to vietnams southern region under a 25-year concession, and diversify toyo inks revenue base from manufacturing printing ink. the company is slated to handle ancillary infrastructure systems, including coal handling, as well as cooling and fresh water systems, pollutant and waste control, removal and treatment systems, a coal yard and a coal jetty, among others. however, toyo ink has yet to commence the project after eight years. managing director song kok cheong had been quoted in the media last month as saying the company was in the final stages of eight years of discussion with the vietnamese authorities. song is also a substantial shareholder of toyo ink with an 11.1% stake. toyo inks earnings, generated from its core ink manufacturing business, have not been exciting over the past two years. for the three months ended june 30, it posted a net profit of rm768,000 on revenue of rm19.93 million. in the corresponding period a year ago, it only recorded a net profit of rm66,000 from rm18.11 million in sales. for the financial year ended june 30, 2016 (fy2016), its profit of rm1.47 million was lower than the rm1.69 million the year before. revenue was flat at rm81.74 million in fy2016. back to the new shareholders. according to toyo inks annual report, pembinaan maju wangi only held 2.04% equity interest or 2.19 million shares as at june 30. the latter possibly acquired shares from cheah yoke han, who ceased to be a substantial shareholder on sept 14 after she sold 1.5 million shares. it is noteworthy that she had been a substantial shareholder since mid-august 2012. pembinaan maju wangi paid rm5.11 million for 9.97 million shares in toyo ink, at prices ranging from 49 sen to 55 sen, between aug 18 and oct 24. so just who is behind pembinaan maju wangi? a check with the companies commission of malaysia (ccm) shows that the company was incorporated and registered in september 1981.its nature of business is stated as property investment, general contractors and commission agents. the directors and shareholders are lam peng kee and fong siew ching, who are possibly husband and wife as they have the same address in the ccm filings. lam controls 80% of the company while fong has a 20% stake. both have been directors since december 2009. pembinaan maju wangi only has a rm2 million charge from cimb bank bhd that remains unsatisfied, but its financials, assets and debt obligations are not available as it has exempt private company status. what seems clear is that both lam and fong are low key and are not known corporate personalities. another question is why pembinaan maju wangi has not sought board representation although it has an 11.36% stake in toyo ink. besides pembinaan maju wangi and cheah, other shareholding changes have taken place as a result of ng chong you passing away. the 7.97 million shares, or 7.45% stake, held by chong you and his wife ling ha kee has passed to their son, ng tze woei. tze woei is also not on the board of toyo ink, despite being a substantial shareholder. other substantial shareholders that do not have board representation are eng lian, which is controlled by the ng family, fong po yin (11.09%) and kok sau lan @ kwok sow lan (close to 7%). non-independent non-executive director lim guan lee holds 10.81%. toyo inks net asset value per share as at june 30 stood at rm1.17, with cash balances of rm2.20 million, short-term debt commitments of rm16.93 million and long-term borrowings of rm8.24 million. much of the assets are in the form of buildings, including a three-storey office and factory on a 2.73-acre plot in selangor with a net book value of rm10.59 million and a 1u00bd-storey freehold semi-detached light industrial building in puchong with a net book value of rm2.42 million. in the notes accompanying its financials, toyo ink says of its prospects: in view of the ongoing market penetration strategy and continuous cost control management, the board of directors is confident of achieving encouraging performance for the financial year ending march 31, 2017. the power plant project will be a game changer for toyo ink, as is the case for a few other malaysian firms, such as jaks resources bhd and mega first corp bhd. nonetheless, power generation projects abroad are not necessarily a secure recurring income source, with one example being mudajaya group bhds project in india.

company and us$6.8 million in cash. we understand msps core business is producing flexible packaging in myanmar, focusing mainly on home personal care products. msp is owned by a major local conglomerate and msp is not the conglomerates core business. msp was set up in 2013 to cater to the packaging needs of its home personal care products. msp had been looking for a partner to help grow the flexible packaging business in myanmar. daibochi said it had been negotiating with msp on this jv for more than a year. this announcement is a positive surprise to us as it should help daibochi expand its business in the asean region and position the company to potentially become one of the largest flexible packaging companies in myanmar, and also in the region. in addition, the jv should help boost the groups pre-tax profit margin beyond the current 8%. msps pre-tax profit margin is currently 29% to 30%, more than three times higher than daibochis. daibochis net debt is set to rise from rm41 million to rm70.2 million after buying the 60% stake in dpm and net gearing would rise from 0.22 times to 0.38 times. we think this should not be a concern due its strong operational cash flow outlook, while dpm is targeted to pay dividends from the third year onwards. dpm is aiming to seek three- or five-year tax exempt status from the authorities in myanmar. myanmars corporate tax rate is currently 25%. assuming dpm starts operations in early 2017 and we consolidate the earnings of daibochi and dpm, daibochis forecast financial year 2017 (fy17f) to fy18f earnings per share (eps) could rise by 18% to 22%. at a forecast 2018 (2018f) 13 times packaging-sector target price-earnings ratio (per), daibochis share price is worth rm2.37, which offers only 3% upside from its

conditions for deal", "article": "  after an almost eight-month wait, japans daiwa securities group inc has finally obtained bank negara malaysias approval to acquire a minority stake in affin hwang investment bank bhd (affin hwang ib)  albeit with certain conditions. sources say that bank negaras conditions relate mainly to daiwas potential entry as a strategic minority shareholder in the investment bank. in a stock exchange filing last tuesday, affin holdings bhd  the banking group that wholly owns affin hwang ib  said the conditions include the finalisation of the shareholder agreement and documents, and approval from other regulatory authorities, including the securities commission malaysia, on the proposed change in shareholder. affin and daiwa securities will review and deliberate on the terms and conditions of bank negaras approval towards the finalisation of the proposal, it said. it is understood that the two parties will seek clarification from the central bank on some of the conditions to ascertain if changes need to be made to their proposal. based on the proposal that the parties submitted to bank negara for approval on feb 29, daiwa had planned to acquire a 25% to 30% stake in affin hwang ib in an all-cash deal, a source familiar with the matter says. this would make it a significant minority shareholder. the central banks concerns could be related to certain rights that daiwa wants as a significant minority shareholder, for example, board representation and voting rights. it does not want a situation where a foreign minority could interrupt or have too large a say in the day-to-day operations of the entity. it would also want to make sure of the value-add of a new shareholder after the experiences rhb has had, the source says. recall that banking group rhb bank bhds middle eastern shareholder, aabar investments pjs, has proven to be a significant swing factor in the banks corporate developments in recent years. with its strategic 21.2% stake at the time, aabar was a key reason a proposed mega merger of rhb, cimb group and malaysia building society bhd, which would have created the countrys largest banking group, was aborted early last year. aabar had, in june 2011, bought a 24.9% stake in rhb (then known as rhb capital bhd) from its sister company, abu dhabi commercial bank, at a hefty price of rm10.80 a share  or 2.25 times its book value  which effectively set the bar too high for rivals looking to take over or merge with rhb. the financial services act 2013 does not set a foreign shareholding limit for malaysian investment banks. thus, it is up to bank negara to decide on a case-by-case basis, with suitability of the foreign shareholder being the key factor taken into consideration, bankers say. prior to the act coming into force in july 2013, bank negara allowed foreign equity participation of up to 70% in investment banks. meanwhile, according to the source, there isnt expected to be any change in the valuation of the proposed affin-daiwa deal despite the almost eight-month time lapse, during which there were significant fluctuations in the yen and ringgit. citing sources, the edge had in march reported that the deal valued affin hwang ib at a price-to-book multiple of between 1.45 and 1.6 times. this represents a significant premium to the pb multiple of 1.28 times that its parent company was subject to when it acquired hwangdbs investment bank  which now forms part of affin hwang ib  back in 2014. it is also a premium over the average pb multiple of 1.3 times for mergers and acquisitions (m&a) in the malaysian investment banking space since 2000. theres no change to the valuation u2026 the transaction is in ringgit terms, the source says. that daiwa is willing to pay a strong premium for a minority stake in affin hwang ib indicates that it has larger plans for the investment bank. it is understood that one of the terms of the proposed deal is that affin hwang ib will have the option to partner daiwa should the japanese investor make any acquisition moves in asean. this is significant for affin hwang ib as it could pave the way for its expansion into the region. unlike its larger peers such as cimb investment bank and rhb investment bank that already have regional operations, affin hwang ib has yet to venture abroad. it, instead, has business alliances with foreign partners. in fact, its relationship with daiwa  japans second largest securities firm after nomura securities  started off that way. the two forged a business alliance in december 2013, sharing equity research reports with each others clients, and facilitating equity trades. daiwa, in an effort to generate more income from abroad, has been looking to acquire minority stakes in brokerage firms in asia. at present, its only investment in an asean brokerage is vietnam-listed saigon securities inc. in april, it raised its stake in saigon securities to 15% from 10% previously. as a global franchise, however, the daiwa group has a presence in most key markets, which is one of the main reasons affin hwang ib is said to be keen for it to be its partner. in asia, daiwa has offices in singapore, hong kong, south korea, taiwan, india and the philippines, among others. still, industry observers wonder if daiwa will patiently sit through the deal. the transaction was initially expected to close by mid-2016. daiwa and affin had officially been in negotiations for 10 months before making their submissions to the central bank. observers also point out that it has taken an unusually long time for the central bank to revert with its approval. affin hwang ib operates four businesses  investment banking, asset management, securities and treasury. for the year to september, it ranked as the countrys top brokerage by trading value and volume. it made a profit before tax of rm55.6 million in 1hfy2015, slightly lower than the rm57.1 million in the same period a year ago. controlled by the armed forced fund board, affin has a history of roping in foreign partners for its entities. affin itself is 23.5%-owned by bank of east asia ltd, the largest independent local bank in hong kong. its asset management business, affin hwang asset management bhd, is 30%-owned by another japanese investor, nikko asset management asia.

certification. sasbadi has been the sole distributor of lego robotics educational products in malaysia since 2015. there were no surprises in the interview. most of il-aces development costs have been expensed off. as such, we estimate il-aces pre-tax margin to be around 45% (after paying commissions to direct selling distributors), compared with the 22% to 25% pre-tax margin of the traditional publishing business. in malaysia, the school term starts in january. as such, we believe demand for il-ace will be strong, starting from early next year. for users who subscribe now, ilaces system automatically transfers the syllabus to the next year. for example, a standard four student currently using il-ace will see the il-ace system switching to the standard five syllabus on jan 1, 2017. given the rising popularity of tablets and smartphones, we believe that now is the right time for sasbadi to launch il-ace. while we believe the first years sales will not be significant, sales should pick up rapidly from the second year. we forecast il-aces financial year 2017 forecast (fy17f) and fy18f sales to be rm20 million and rm140 million respectively. the company recently received an order worth rm3.9 million from the education ministry to supply lego education robotic sets to 160 primary and secondary schools in rural areas. given the governments continued focus on stem, sasbadis lego

ending 2016 (9mfy16) core earnings to rm207.5 million (+3.3% y-o-y), which was mainly driven by positive rental reversions, backed by sustained occupancy rates. the groups revenue growth was mainly

tenants have already recommitted to leases, with average upward revisions in the mid-double digits. this further underscores the popularity of its highly sought-after malls, which have a long waiting list for retail space. given the lack of high-quality malls up for grabs in the market, igb reit does not see any viable third-party acquisitions transpiring in the near term. thus, we do not see the

analysts say kuala lumpur kepong bhds (klk) proposed takeover of london-listed mp evans group plc is timely and opportunistic in view of the pounds weakness, and expect the plantation giants earnings to rise by 3% to 5% in the immediate future. but they noted that the deal will result in a marked rise in klks borrowings. rhb research analyst hoe lee leng said overall, she is fairly positive on the acquisition, which is highly likely to go through. we believe this move is strategic for klk, given that its fresh fruit bunch growth is in the low single digits and that it does not really have any new land bank to plant up [other than a small area in liberia], she said in a report yesterday. hoe said based on klks financial year 2015 (fy15) profits, it would be paying about 17 times price-earnings ratio (per) for mp evans, and on annualised profits for the first half ended march 31, 2016, the per comes down to about 12 times. since this is an all-cash transaction, the company intends to fund this acquisition entirely with debt [which] would bring its net gearing up to 45% (fy15: 26%). assuming an interest rate of 5%, we estimate this acquisition would result in a net earnings accretion to klk of about 4% to 5% for fy17, she said. rhb research is, however, not imputing the acquisition into its forecasts until it has been completed, said hoe, adding that there would thus be no change to its buy call on klk with a target price of rm26.40. klk announced on monday that it is offering to acquire mp evans for 640 pence (rm32.52) a share, along with an interim dividend of 2.25 pence a share, in an all-cash deal. this values the deal at u00a3360.5 million (rm1.8 billion). klk, malaysias third-largest palm oil producer, said the offer price of 640 pence a share represented a premium of about 51% to the last closing price of mp evans of 426.25 pence on monday, and 54% to its 30-day volume-weighted average closing price of 417.4 pence. public investment bank bhd analyst chong hoe leng opined that it is a timely entry for klk, considering the weak british currency, which has dropped more than 20% year to date. it is also a good opportunity for mp evans existing shareholders to exit, given the low liquidity of the companys share trading, said chong. the recent crude palm oil (cpo) price rally, coupled with its young age profile and potential property value in malaysia, also justifies the decision for klk to acquire mp evans. the acquisition will expand its planted area in indonesia by 19% to 163,762ha and help lower its existing age profile, he said in a note. mp evans, through its subsidiary and associated undertakings, operates oil palm and rubber plantations in indonesia, beef-cattle operations in australia and property development in peninsular malaysia. in malaysia, the company reportedly owns an oil palm estate with property development prospects and a minority share in bertam properties sdn bhd that operates on one of the companys former estates. the offer is conditional upon total valid acceptances of more than 50%. in the event the offer becomes unconditional with valid acceptances of not less than 75%, klk will make an application for the cancellation of a listing on the alternative investment market, noted chong. if the offer becomes unconditional with total valid acceptances of more than 90%, the offeror will compulsorily acquire the remaining shares based on the same offer price, he said. we believe the deal might drag for a period of time, depending on the number of shares they manage to secure throughout the period. pending more updates on the takeover development, we maintain our neutral call with an unchanged target price of rm23.46, he added. cimb investment bank bhd analyst ivy ng called the deal opportunistic and attractive at a time when the ringgit had strengthened against the pound. while noting that the acquisition could enhance klks earnings by 3% for fy18  based on the consensus forecast  she was surprised by the news. klk may have viewed the recent weakness in the pound as well as weak plantation earnings as a good opportunity to launch a takeover offer for mp evans. we are positive on the bid as we estimate the group will be acquiring the assets at an attractive price, and the proposed acquisition will enhance its future earnings, said ng, who maintains cimbs klk earnings forecasts for now, pending the outcome. meanwhile, hong leong investment bank bhd analyst chye wen fei said the offer, if accepted by mp evans, could result in klks total borrowings rising from rm4.6 billion and 0.44 times to rm6.6 billion and 0.62 times respectively. pricing-wise, chye said it values mp evans at the latters financial year ending dec 31, 2016 per of 22.7 times (based on the consensus forecast), current price-to-book ratio of 1.14 times and enterprise value to hectare of about rm50,000 (without taking into account its property and cattle businesses). nevertheless, we believe klk may end up with a higher price tag, as the board of mp evans views klks offer as inadequate, he said. while we like klk for its age profile and healthy balance sheet, further upside is capped by its rich valuations and weak property sentiment (which will in turn drag its property division), he said, maintaining a hold call on the stock."}, "243": {"date_posted":

furthermore, their business grows gradually, in tandem with the increasing waste output of the population and the growing awareness about environmental care and protection. recent statistics from the ministry of urban wellbeing, housing and local government indicate that malaysians currently produce 33,000 tonnes of solid waste a day. this is seven years ahead of the earlier target of 30,000 tonnes for 2020. despite the defensive qualities and stable growth prospects, these companies appear to have been overlooked by investors due to their unsexy and mundane business models. it was not until last year that these unloved waste management stocks came to investors attention (see chart 1). tex cycle technology malaysia bhds share price started a surge of almost 200% in september last year. analabs resources bhd began its surge last november, awc bhd in april this year and brite-tech bhd in may. of the eight listed waste management companies, cypark resources bhd is the market leader in terms of market capitalisation, revenue and profitability. riding government initiatives to develop the local green energy sector, the bumiputera-controlled company envisions itself as one of the leaders in the transformation of the green energy industry. cimb research and public investment bank research have a buy call on the stock, citing its pioneer status in the waste-to-energy (wte) business and the potential to secure more renewable energy (re) projects moving forward. the company is currently constructing the countrys first wte plant in ladang tanah merah, negeri sembilan. targeted to be completed in 2017, the plant will exclusively process most of the waste generated in the state for the next 25 years. based on its input capacity of 1,000 tonnes per day and design capacity of 20mw, cypark estimates that the plant could generate annual revenue of more than rm80 million. another bumiputera waste management company is awc bhd, which derives a stable and recurring concession income for maintaining government buildings in the southern region of the peninsula and sarawak. although facilities management accounted for 58% of its revenue in the financial year ended june 30, 2015 (fy2015), waste collection system management contributed about two-thirds of its operating profit. earlier this year, its concession was renewed for 10 years at rm52 million per annum for the first five years. awc was also given a rm145 million critical asset refurbishment programme concession at rm14.5 million per annum for 10 years. moving forward, awc plans to reduce its reliance on government-linked projects by expanding its waste management in the plumbing and rainwater harvesting segments. the first waste management stock that saw a surge in share price is tex cycle technology malaysia bhd, buoyed by its new waste plant that started operations last year. the company is reported to have plans to launch its maiden venture in the overseas markets next year, particularly in southeast asia. in august, tex cycle obtained approval from authorities to build and operate a re power plant with a capacity to supply 2mw per hour of electricity to tenaga nasional bhd for 16 years, starting in january 2018. although its share price has declined from its all-time high of rm1.49 in july to close at rm1.08 last thursday, tex cycle is still trading at a high trailing price-earnings ratio (per) of 28.35 times. besides cypark, awc and tex cycle, are there any alternatives for investors wishing to gain exposure to this sector? based on trailing per and trailing dividend yields (see table), analabs and brite-tech  both involved in providing industrial waste management solutions  appear relatively attractive and have strong balance sheets. since cash-rich analabs ventured into the manufacturing of resin-impregnated papers in 2010, the paper segment has grown to account for two-thirds of its revenue. as the company has invested in its building materials business in the last five years, net profit was impacted by higher non-cash depreciation charges. while revenue from its recycling business has been relatively stable, analabs plans to invest in its waste management operation over the next two years. moving forward, it plans to restructure its loss-making pipe laying and rehabilitation works business in singapore. note that the company is sitting on net cash of rm41.3 million (including available-for-sale financial assets), which is equivalent to one-third of its market value. meanwhile, brite-tech bhd, which provides integrated water purification and wastewater treatment solutions for various industries, has registered a steady 10% compound annual growth rate in revenue in the past five years. excluding income derived from investments that distorted its earnings figures, pre-tax profit rebounded 34.7% to rm6 million in 2015, in line with its top-line growth. the company has raised its dividends every couple of years since 2005, from 0.2 sen per share to 0.63 sen last year. with its share price up 28% this year, its yield has been compressed to 4% from 5% at the start of the year. brite-tech bought rm14.2

for now, there are preliminary signs that depreciation and amortisation charges, which were similar at rm249.64 million and rm250.87 million in the first quarter and second quarter of fy2016 respectively, could have already stabilised. still, a slower-than-expected passenger growth rate vis-a-vis the forecasts may force the group to revisit its current assumptions. thats because mahbs amortisation policy is not based on the straight line method, but is determined on the unit of production (uop) method, which reflects the assets usage based on passenger volume and usage of airport activities over the concession period. some fund managers have expressed concern over the low growth in passenger numbers, which may drag revenue and expose investors to risks during a downturn. they are also concerned the group may pay lower dividends on lower net profit. however, it is worth noting that mahb paid a dividend of 8.5 sen per share in fy2015, amounting to rm141.1 million against 5.6 sen per share in fy2014 totalling rm87 million. in a sept 14 report, midf research notes that impressive growth numbers from malaysian airports have been affected by declines in turkey, dragging down overall growth for mahb passenger traffic to 2% y-o-y in the first eight months of this year. to this, mahb says it is confident that its operations in malaysia will continue to grow in tandem with the expected increase in passenger movement combined with aggressive controls over spending. it is maintaining its passenger traffic growth for malaysia airports at 2.5% for 2016. mahb takes its nation-building role seriously. we are committed to supporting government development plans, and are an active partner in a number of government initiatives, mahb tells the edge. it adds that the carrying amounts of its assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. if any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated to determine the amount of impairment loss. so how long will this go on for? an analyst with a local investment bank believes that depreciation and amortisation charges for fy2016 are likely to remain high, and projects that they will come to about rm950 million due to a combination of isga and klia2. but we expect mahbs fy2016 earnings to rebound y-o-y as airports mature with a higher utilisation rate, [albeit they will] remain low, dragged by depreciation, the analyst says. high operating leverage in mahb will amplify earnings growth. depreciation will drag performance only if passenger numbers do not perform. current numbers look palatable, save for isga which trended down due to terrorism concerns but it should normalise, he remarks. still, the analyst points out that passenger numbers are projected on a long-term basis and thus, falling short by one year is unlikely to materially impact the calculation of depreciation. having said that, if there is substantial deviation, the auditors may require a revision in projection. for hlib research, it is projecting mahbs depreciation and amortisation charges to rise to rm921 million in fy2016 and rm931 million in fy2017, while interest expense is expected to stabilise at rm620 million and rm615 million in fy2016 and fy2017 respectively. despite the slower turnaround for isga, hlib research expects mahb to post exponential earnings growth for fy2016 with the expectation of continued recovery in tourist arrivals, especially from china, as well as air travel demand from locals in 2h2016. mahb also stands to benefit from a potential tariff increase in klia2 by 2017, it says in a july 29 report, and expects mahb to post a net profit of rm126 million in fy2016. meanwhile, affin hwang capital research, in a sector report dated sept 23, comments that the psc hike will lead to step-up increase in mahbs top line, but not all charges will flow to the bottom line due to the standing revenue-sharing agreement with the government in the range of 8% to 10%. our back-of-envelope calculations shows mahbs fy2017e earnings could potentially more than double y-o-y, largely due to the low base effect and its high operating leverage, it says. all things being considered, we believe the psc hike is a reasonable and conscious decision by the authorities to standardise the charges across the airports. the hike is also in part to compensate mahb as a fair investment return for the rm4.5 billion price tag for the construction of klia2, and to ensure quality upkeep of the airports, affin hwang adds. however, cimb research is of the view that the average psc revenue accrual may fall by 2.6% under the purported new psc structure compared with the current rates as a new asean category is introduced. in a sept 22 note, cimb research goes on to explain that if the reported psc materialises, domestic passengers will only have to pay rm5 more (to rm11 from rm6) and asean travellers only rm3 more (to rm35 from rm32) at klia2. we estimate that the average psc revenue accrual will fall 2.6% to rm35.06, as the reduction in asean psc at the kl international airport and other airports offsets the psc hikes seen at klia2. this possible outcome would be a significant disappointment for us as we had incorporated higher average pscs into our model, it says.

have very low stock in malaysia, said cimb investment bank analyst ivy ng. we are expecting prices to be rangebound with support at rm2,400 per tonne. in her presentation at the palm oil trade fair and seminar yesterday, ng noted that malaysias latest production figure of 1.55 million tonnes as at september suggested a tight supply situation. for the first nine months of 2016, production fell 15% compared with the same period in 2015. we are projecting a 10% decline in production for malaysia for 2016, [while] expecting [a] total production of 17.9 million tonnes for the year. to achieve this 17.9 million tonnes production figure, the fourth quarter production figure has to be 5% higher than a year ago. so, the october numbers have to be strong. if not, then there would be [a] potential downside to our forecast, said ng. looking at the september figures and based on channel checks, she said the october numbers appear to be quite optimistic. she said cimb ib has an average

benny lee said the cpo price has been developing a bullish trend over the past few months, and he expects the bullish trend to continue going forward. the cpo price is starting to break the rm2,650 level. if it does break this level, we will still see a strong bullish trend. the support level is at rm2,500, and in my opinion there is no reason for prices to fall below that level unless there is some unexpected event. if it breaks the rm2,650 resistance level, it is likely that the cpo price can reach rm2,800 and peak at rm3,000 by the end of the first quarter next year, he said, adding that

75% of japanese and german government bonds offering negative yields now, global bond investors must decide between holding negative-yielding bonds in safe haven markets and income-producing assets in riskier markets. in equity markets, investors face a similar dilemma: they must choose between paying a premium for safer defensives or go bottom-fishing for cheap, riskier cyclicals. owing to the lacklustre growth prospects caused by the changes in the economic climate, investors have been seeking shelter in defensive stocks, whose earnings are relatively more resilient when things are bad. and these stocks declare dividends regularly, although the quantum may become smaller if economic conditions deteriorate. the rush to defensive stocks in the past 18 months or so has lifted the share price of such stocks and their valuations appear to be expensive. in bursa malaysia, this hunt for yields and safety is probably best illustrated by the strong rally in food and beverage stocks such as dutch lady milk industries bhd, fraser & neave holdings bhd and nestlu00e9 malaysia bhd earlier this year (see chart 1). the continued rise in their share prices has pulled down dividend yields. dutch ladys dividend yield was reduced to 3.7% from 4.6% at the start of the year while nestlu00e9s yield declined to 3.3% from 4.2% and f&ns fell to 2.6% from 3%. with dividend yields compressing and share prices trading at historical highs, it may be time for investors to think about whether they should continue putting money into defensive stocks. in fact, it is worth noting that the valuation

with their cyclical counterparts in terms of price-to-book ratio.  cheap is not enough the increased alignment among the worlds major central banks and the repricing of risks in developed markets saw global funds returning to asian bond and equity markets this year, particularly in countries and sectors with reform agendas. notably, cyclical sectors in the msci emerging markets index, which had

1.4% year to date, no thanks to weak corporate earnings and heightening political risks. that said, the local stock market tends to take cues from regional markets. will beaten-down cyclical sectors be back in favour soon? a majority of the fund managers contacted by the edge say defensive stocks remain their choice for now given the economic uncertainties. the disappointing earnings performance in the quarter ended june 30 have reinforced their belief in seeking shelter in defensive counters. as half of the top 10 performing stocks are steel-related, steel stocks should come to mind quickly. nonetheless, analysts generally believe that the fundamentals of the local steel industry remain weak and it is difficult for local producers to compete with chinas state-backed steel players. the other cyclical sector that is back on investors radar is property (see chart 3), specifically well-established large-cap developers that have generated an average year-to-date return of 11.7%, beating mid-cap developers 1.1% and small-cap developers negative 4.8% (see chart 4). to be sure, the industry outlook is still challenging, given bank negaras property cooling measures and the shift in banks focus to asset quality.  banking on budget 2017 nonetheless, both public investment bank and cimb research are overweighting the sector, citing its historical low valuations and attractive risk-reward benefits. in our coverage universe, most property developers earnings in the near term are underpinned by healthy unbilled sales both locally and from overseas and supported by healthy balance sheets. we continue to like companies that have low holding costs, that is, cheap land bank, writes public investment bank analyst tan siang hing in a recent note. with some trading even [at] more than [a] 50% discount to book value, we believe holding the stocks would give investors exposure in real assets [that are] cheaper than physical properties, which should move up in tandem with inflation in the long run. also, demand is expected to be underpinned by a young demographic, rising income and improved connectivity from infrastructure spending in the country, he adds. nevertheless, kenanga research believes the outperformance of the property sector is sentimental in nature. the sector has recently rallied in anticipation of positive budget 2017 measures for affordable housing (for example, developer interest-bearing schemes for first home owners), increasing housing withdrawals from account 2 of the epf (employee provident fund) to 40% from 30%, and overnight policy rate cuts. however, our studies indicate these are sentiment boosters at best, as it may not translate into a bullish demand cycle or may not be addressing actual affordability issues, says the research house, which recently upgraded the sector to neutral from underweight. however, the absence of any of the anticipated good news in the budget 2017 announcement may see their share prices sharply correct, given the recent run-up. our preferred pick is matrix concepts holdings bhd as we believe it will be the best affordable housing player proxy whose sales are on track and offers strong yields of 5.8%, it notes.  two macro drivers in 2h2016 looking ahead, there are two macro catalysts that could drive share performance in the near term, that is, budget 2017 in october and a weaker ringgit towards the end of the year. the expected beneficiaries of budget 2017 include construction players, consumer companies and affordable housing developers while a weaker ringgit could revive interest in export-oriented stocks, says kaf investment bank chief investment officer gan kong yik. that said, not all consumer companies will benefit from the upcoming budget. we favour consumer staples such as food and beverage rather than consumer discretionary like soft drinks, clothes and brewers. take dutch lady and f&n, for example. we like dutch lady better as consumer preferences are likely to shift from soft drinks towards healthier choices like milk over time. likewise, we also prefer affordable housing plays like mkh bhd, matrix concepts and tambun indah land bhd. additionally, chances are that sin stocks like heineken malaysia bhd and carlsberg brewery malaysia bhd will be taxed more, he adds. as for the currency factor, we see the ringgit strengthening in the first half of next year but it could weaken in the second half due to the possibility of another policy rate cut and a rate hike by the us federal reserve this december. lower domestic interest rate could put downward pressure on the ringgit and exporters would be prime beneficiaries of a weak ringgit, he concludes.

in the region. the benchmark fbm klci increased 0.9% in a week to 1,686.44 points. however, the index had fallen 1.5% since last friday to 1,661.39 points yesterday. trading volume continued to decline last week. the average daily trading volume last week was 1.6 billion shares compared with 1.7 billion shares two weeks ago. the average trading value fell from rm1.9 billion to rm1.8 billion. local and foreign institutions picked up stocks that retailers sold despite a weaker ringgit. net buying from local and foreign institutions last week (monday to friday) were rm114 million and rm30

long-term 200-day moving average at 1,665 points and also the short-term 30-day moving average just after being supported above it in the past one month. this indicates that the trend has turned

the relative strength index and momentum oscillator fell below their mid-levels and are declining. this indicates that the market sentiment has turned bearish. furthermore, the bearish trend momentum is strengthening as the fbm klci has fallen below the bottom band of the expanding bollinger bands and the moving average convergence divergence fell below its mid-level. last week, i mentioned that the market may still rebound but is still bearish and likely to decline in the short term. the market did rebound, but there is still resistance especially after the pullback last friday. the immediate resistance for the fbm klci is at 1,700 points. furthermore, the selldown in the us market at the end of last week may trigger selling in the financial markets. hence, we expect the market to decline in this short trading week and the index to test the immediate support level at 1,650 points. next week, the market may rebound in the earlier part of the week and if it fails to climb above 1,700 points, then expect further declines in the short term towards 1,600 points. benny lee is chief market strategist for jupiter securities sdn bhd. jupiter securities is a participating

have begun to price in the real possibility of a fourth telco entering the singapore market after myrepublic, airyotta and tpg telecom submitted their applications to the infocomm development authority (ida) on thursday to bid for the fourth mobile operator licence in the new entrant spectrum auction (nesa) in october. over the past three months, speculation that the potential bidders might fail to raise the required funding have pushed the share prices of singtel, starhub and m1 up by 4% to 11%. but news of the applications is already negatively impacting stocks of the three telcos with shares of singtel, m1 and starhub trending lower although submission of the expression of interest documents is no guarantee of the parties eligibility to bid. for one, research house cimb is maintaining its neutral rating on the telco sector, and has a buy for singtel and hold for m1 and starhub. in a thursday note, analyst foong choon chen notes that m1 and starhub stand to lose more given m1s business which is local and mobile-focused, and starhubs 71% earnings contribution from mobile. if a fourth telco materialises, foong will lower his target prices for both m1 and starhub from s$2.80 to s$2.40; and from s$3.70 to s$3.20 respectively. singtel will be the least impacted as we estimate its singapore mobile business will only account for 11% of group fy17 ebitda, says foong adding that the s$4.50 target price for singtel, already takes into account the entry of a fourth telco. uob kay hian is also maintaining its underweight rating on the sector, and has a buy on singtel but sell for m1 and starhub. analyst jonathan koh believes competition in the telco sector is not limited to the entry of the newcomers but could also heat up in the general spectrum auction (stage b)  for incumbents only  in october. he noted that starhub in may raised s$300 million through its medium-term note programme. this could signify a change to the previous cosy oligopoly. the brokerage is pricing in its worst-case scenario with the entry of a fourth telco disrupting the status quo and lowered its target prices for singtel, starhub and m1 to s$4.61, s$2.62 and s$2.00 respectively. still, some market watchers are not convinced that the fourth telco would come to fruition. daiwa capital markets analyst ramakrishna maruvada estimates that the odds of a potential new entrant has risen to 50%, but remains sceptical as their likely financing plans, powered by relatively small balance sheets, may not find muster with the regulator. while we expect stock prices to remain volatile in the near term, we continue to believe that entry of new players in the singapore market is not a certainty, chiefly due to financing issues, unlike some of the views in the market, says maruvada. maruvada instead believes the real threat to singtel is in india, where reliance jio has unveiled aggressive price plans that include free voice calls and cheap data tariffs of inr50 per gb (s$1.02 per gb), compared with the industry rate of inr250 per gb, and could impact bharti airtels outlook. daiwa is therefore maintaining its neutral view of the sector, as well as its buy rating on m1 at s$2.66, hold on singtel at s$3.95 and underperform on starhub at s$3.63. shares of singtel, starhub and m1 are trading between 2.5% and 6% lower at s$3.87, s$3.47 and s$2.50

the case for a rate increase was strengthening, but provided little detail on when the fed would next move. vice chair stanley fischer suggested on cnbc that a rate hike as soon as next month was possible, it said. alliancedbs research in its evening edition monday said that led by last fridays up close in the preceding day, the fbm klci had on aug 29 traded higher to 1,685.18 as some market participants continued to play on the buying side in anticipation of a higher market. however, it said non-follow through buying interest in the area of 1,685.18 prompted profit taking activity to chip in. it said this pushed the benchmark index down to 1,677.70 before settling at 1,681.60 (down 1.49 or 0.09%). in the broader market, losers outnumbered gainers with 513 stocks ending lower and 314 stocks finishing higher. that gave a market breadth of 0.61 indicating the bears were in control, it said. alliancedbs research said the market made a higher high on aug 29, but it failed to sustain in the green throughout most of the trading sessions. given the way this market carried itself in recent days, market participants appeared to have chosen to stay sidelines as market continued to consolidate between 1,673 and 1,690. in the absence of positive catalyst, we can see that the overall market momentum is declining and revolving around a small group of blue chip stocks with smaller cap stocks experiencing lower relative strength in relation to the overall market. while this is the most probable market scenario to expect at this juncture, an ability on the part of the

management firms chief investment officer david ng (pic). its a question that we always ponder over. i think investors and global investors may take a different perspective. i think the peak of that negative news about what you are referring to (dojs complaint related to 1mdb) is already known. everything is out there and people [have] moved beyond that. i dont think there is anything else that investors do not already know, ng told reporters after a press briefing on the firms global market outlook on the second half of 2016 (2h16). on july 20, the us government filed lawsuits to seize us$1 billion (rm3.99 billion) in assets bought with money it said was stolen from 1mdb. the civil lawsuits said a total of us$3.5 billion was misappropriated from 1mdb, a fund which prime minister datuk seri najib razak oversaw. the us government is also trying to seize proceeds from the 2013 film the wolf of wall street. riza aziz, najibs stepson and co-founder of red granite pictures, which produced the movie, was named in the lawsuit. ng cited neighbouring countries like thailand, which went through a military coup, and the philippines, where its presidents faced strong criticisms, as examples of how previous flow of negative news had had little impact on the countries performance. i think we need to disassociate the issues surrounding the doj report from the market, ng said. ng also said now is the right time to buy into malaysias equity market, which has been lagging behind in terms of equities recovery when compared with its regional peers, and recommends specific themes like construction and infrastructure to follow, besides yield play. if you look at foreign [investors] position in malaysias stock market, foreigners have not been investing in malaysia. on a rolling 12-month basis, foreigners have been net sellers of malaysia. [but] technically, its a good thing. if we can demonstrate some growth as we move into the second half of next year, foreigners will come back, said ng. when asked if one should buy malaysia now, ng said: we are [buying]. aside from the construction and infrastructure theme, which would benefit construction companies and steel and cement makers, he said dividend income features prominently in the firms strategy in the current low-inflation environment. meanwhile, amid slower global growth and low inflation and interest rate, yield stocks like real estate investment trusts (reits) here have done very well, said ng. among them is igb reit, he said. as for good yield stocks, fraser & neave holdings bhd and classic scenic bhd were cited as examples. investors are also looking at reforms and restructuring that are taking place in [certain] companies, like the appointment of former cabinet minister tan sri abdul wahid omar as the new chairman of permodalan nasional bhd, which could be potentially value-unlocking, he said. he also noted a rise in activity in the market in the last two weeks, which saw counters like felda global ventures holdings bhd (fgv) and sapurakencana petroleum bhd climbing. this, he said, shows there is some return of appetite for risks. that means investors are prepared to take on more risk. for sapurakencana, it is suitable if you are looking for exposure to oil ... as for fgv, the new leadership that has come on board has said the right things, such as no more acquisitions. among ngs top picks for 2h16 are tenaga nasional bhd (tnb) and cimb group holdings bhd. in terms of large caps, we like tnb. i think tnb gives you that combination of earnings certainty and some earnings growth, as well as potential for higher dividend, he said. another stock in the large caps that we think has come down to levels that make it attractive is cimb. i think a lot of banks still need to run through issues that all banks are facing, which is rising

have been net sellers of malaysia. technically, it's a good thing. \"if we can demonstrate some growth as we move into the second half of next year, foreigners will come back. the other asean markets have done well. from a valuation standpoint, thailand, indonesia, (and) philippines have done well and [been] rerated,\" affin hwang chief investment officer david ng told the media after the firm's briefing on navigating the undercurrents of asian markets. when asked if one should buy malaysia now, ng said: \"we are [buying]. we think there are also specific themes [at play] in malaysia.\" ng added affin hwang is taking a barbell approach to investing in malaysia. \"construction is one of those we like. at the same time, we think we are still in that low-inflation environment so dividend income features prominently in our strategy. so, it's a combination of dividend income and some growth ideas such as construction and infrastructure beneficiaries,\" ng added. during the briefing earlier, ng said the country's infrastructure spending is one of the positive themes that could be beneficial to construction companies, besides steel and cement makers. he pointed out ann joo resources bhd, one of those that have been showing strong earnings, as among those benefitting under the theme. ann joo announced a second consecutive profitable quarter with earnings of rm92.4 million in the second quarter ended june 30, 2016 (2qfy16), compared to a net loss of rm10.85 million in 2qfy15. the group returned to the black in 1qfy16, after posting a net profit of rm5.52 million. meanwhile, amid slower global growth, low inflation and interest rate, yield stocks in malaysia, such as real estate investment trusts (reits), have done very well, said ng. among the reits that have performed is igb reit, said ng. as for stocks that give good yields, fraser & neave holdings bhd (f&n) and classic scenic bhd were cited as examples. \"investors are also looking at reforms and restructuring that are taking place in [certain] companies, like the appointment of former cabinet minister tan sri abdul wahid omar as the new chairman of permodalan nasional bhd (pnb), which could be potentially value-unlocking,\" he added. in terms of the rise in activities seen in the market in the last two weeks, which saw counters like felda global ventures holdings bhd (fgv) and sapurakencana petroleum bhd climbing, ng said there is some return of appetite for risks. \"that means investors are prepared to take on more risk. for sapurakencana, it is suitable if you are looking for exposure to oil. i think malaysia is one of the largest and closest proxy to oil trade. as for fgv, the new leadership that has come on board have said the right things, such as no more acquisitions,\" he said. among ng's top picks are tenaga nasional bhd (tnb) and cimb group holdings bhd. \"in terms of large caps, one stock that we like is tnb. i think tnb gives you that combination of earnings certainty and some earnings growth, as well as potential for higher dividend,\" he said. \"another stock in the large caps that we think has come down to levels that make it look attractive is cimb. i think a lot of banks still need to run through issues that all banks are facing, which is rising non-performing loans (npl), slowing credit or loan growth. but we think these are already priced in for cimb. it's trading at 0.8 times its book. its subsidiary in indonesia is also recovering very well,\" ng added. to ng, cimb's indonesian subsidiary, pt bank cimb niaga tbk (cimb niaga), was the weak link of the group previously, but ng said issues surrounding cimb niaga have passed. "}, "258": {"date_posted": "18/8/2016", "title": "cover story: can zakaria make things right at fgv?", "article": "  it has just been 100 days plus a few weeks since datuk zakaria arshad took over the reins at felda global ventures holdings bhd (fgv). in this short period, he has already made an impact, scrapping the proposed acquisition of a 55% stake in chinese edible oil company zhong ling nutril-oil holdings ltd for rm976.25 million. more recently, he said fgv had opted out of a proposed acquisition of a 37% stake in pt eagle high plantations tbk for us$680 million or rm2.89 billion at the time the deal was made public in june last year. in an exclusive interview with the edge, zakaria says fgvs target of having operations encompassing an area of one million hectares of plantations by 2020 (including the harvest from settler estates)  set in 2012  is no longer a priority. at present, fgv has a landbank of more than 431,000ha, an increase of 70,000ha since its debut on the local bourse in 2012. settler estates come up to 475,000ha. armed with a war chest of rm4.459 billion from its initial public offering, fgv quickly expanded its landbank, acquiring estates in sabah, sarawak and west kalimantan. the eagle high plantations proposal has been the most controversial to date, mainly because of the high valuation for the assets. i have to be very frank. i think its difficult for us to achieve that target of one million hectares. i believe i have to focus on our existing assets. i have to look into the quality aspect of things, he says, adding that fgv is no longer in merger and acquisition mode. nevertheless, he does not deny that the going thus far has been difficult and he takes solace in self-help writer robin sharmas words: change is hard at first, messy in the middle and gorgeous in the end. the 56-year-old zakarias appointment as head honcho at fgv took effect on april 1 amid much fanfare, as he is an anak felda or the son of a settler. as such, he is viewed as being close to the more than 112,000 settlers who supply fresh fruit bunches (ffb) to fgvs mills and collectively own up to 19.4% of the company through felda asset holdings co sdn bhd and koperasi permodalan felda malaysia bhd. despite the fanfare and the support of the settlers, zakaria, over the past few months, has had to grapple with the many issues facing fgv  declining crude palm oil (cpo) prices, the groups ageing oil palm trees, low ffb production, high cost of production and depleting cash pile, among others. then, last may, fgv requested an immediate withdrawal of roundtable on sustainable palm oil (rspo) principles and criteria certificates of its 58 mills located all over malaysia. zakaria says it was mainly due to social issues related to its workers, and fgv has targeted to get back the rspo status within three years. the cpo third-month futures are at present around the rm2,300 per tonne mark, having gained from late august last year when it hit rm1,800 per tonne, its lowest since 2009. however, the commodity is on the decline, losing 17.24% from its one-year peak of rm2,779 on march 29 to last thursdays close of rm2,300. in the first three months of this year, fgv suffered a 16% decline in ffb output compared with the previous corresponding period. the malaysian palm oil industry saw a 10% drop in ffb output over the same period. another problem is fgvs ageing trees. of its 332,586ha of planted area, 43% are considered old at 21 years and above. only a third of the ffb milled at fgvs mills are from its own estates. another one third are from the settlers and the rest from smallholders. fgv prides itself as the largest cpo producer in the world, churning out three million tonnes annually. it has been quite challenging ... a lot of things have to be done, so many areas to look into, says zakaria. these issues have also led to the company suffering losses. for its first three months of fy2016 ended march, fgv suffered a net loss of rm65.54 million on revenue of rm3.75 billion. in the previous corresponding period, it registered a net profit of rm3.57 million on revenue of rm2.71 billion. as at end-march this year, the company had deposits, cash and bank balances of rm2.4 billion and short and long-term liabilities of rm5.4 billion. this worked out to a net gearing of 0.47 times. but zakaria thinks that the worst is over. in our experience, from our plantations, we gauge that the worst is over. fgvs oil palm trees have not been as badly affected as those of other planters in malaysia and indonesia by the worst el niu00f1o on record. its ffb production fell 13.7% in the first half of the year from a year ago, compared with ioi corp bhds 20.9% and sime darby bhds 14.8%. fgvs june production actually declined a lower 1.5% year on year compared with -14.6% and -19.7% in may and april respectively. public investment bank bhd, in a report released last week, concurs, saying that it expects to see improved results in the upcoming 2qfy2016 compared with the first quarter due to the stronger cpo prices and higher ffb production. however, it feels that fgvs results could be relatively flat y-o-y as stronger cpo prices (2qfy2016: rm2,601/mt versus 2qfy2015: rm2,193/mt) will offset the weaker ffb output. while public investment bank has a neutral call on fgv and a 12-month target price of rm1.71, cimb investment bank has a contrarian add call on the stock and a target price of rm2.08. cimb says catalysts for fgv include the scrapping of plans to buy into eagle high, its plans to slash rm100 million in administrative costs in fy2016, improved ffb yields via better agronomic practices and the sale of assets that are loss-making. zakaria clarifies that fgv is not in a hurry to sell non-core assets that are profitable. they give revenue and profit, so there is no rush to sell, i can take [my] time. but if they are losing money, i will have to chop them off fast. he cites felda prodata systems sdn bhd as an example. last year, it posted over rm20 million in profit. in the past, fgv has sold part of its downstream business, namely trt-etgo in canada, which was loss-making. however, it is keeping trt us, which refines coconut oil and tallow in boston, massachusetts. we are looking to expand this, as it is making money. it gives us a lot of money, so [there is] no point for us to sell it. last year, it made about us$20 million, zakaria explains. there are indications that fgvs upcoming financial results will be positive, with the company returning to the black. cimb forecasts fgv raking in rm162.5 million in net profit on revenue of rm15.74 billion for fy2016. in fy2015, the company registered a net profit of rm139.6 million from rm15.7 billion in sales. now, the question is, will zakaria be able to deliver a much improved fgv, considering the tide of scepticism against the group following disappointing results and a string of expensive acquisitions? given fgvs political and socioeconomic origins, the concern for investors has been  since the beginning  whether the major shareholders interests are aligned with the minorities. that aside, zakaria is personable and well liked within the group. zakaria is experienced. he will do well if he gets some decent advisers. his positives are his people management skills. hes a people person, so he can get difficult things done as he can get people to work with him, says an industry player familiar with fgv. possibly in line with the better outlook painted by zakaria, fgvs shares have started to gain momentum. the stock closed last friday at rm1.85, giving the company a market capitalisation of rm6.75 billion. over the past eight weeks, it has gained almost 41%. while some may attribute the share price performing to the low base (fgvs net asset per share as at end-march was rm1.77) at which it is trading, others say it is possible that the high volume could be because of predators looking to buy into the company on the cheap. one name that has cropped up several times is tan sri syed mokhtar albukhary and his plantation vehicle, tradewinds plantation bhd, which is under tradewinds corp bhd. it seems that tradewinds plantation is looking at a corporate exercise that may see it emerge as a substantial shareholder in fgv. but then again, talk of syed mokhtar eyeing a stake in fgv has been making the rounds since 2013. on this, zakaria says he is not aware of any potential suitors, either tradewinds plantation or other companies. the substantial shareholders in fgv include the federal land development authority (17.29%), felda asset holdings (13.66%), lembaga tabung haji (7.78%) and koperasi permodalan felda (5.74%).

holdings bhd, but remains highly committed to holding a substantial and strategic stake in the loss-making national carmaker. the conglomerate also expects proton, which is currently undertaking a request for proposal (rfp) to find a partner to help grow its automotive business, to complete the exercise in the first quarter of next year (1q17). drb-hicom remains highly committed to hold a substantial and strategic stake in proton, and is confident of and is currently assisting proton in its turnaround programme, the group said in a filing with bursa malaysia yesterday. it must be highlighted that as part of the requirement of the rm1.5 billion loan granted by the government, proton is currently undertaking a rfp exercise seeking a partner for proton who can provide a strategic, operational and cultural fit on a permanent basis with the intention to grow its auto business, it said. this exercise is expected to be completed in 1q17, and its implementation is being overseen by the task force committee formed by the government to monitor the turnaround of proton, drb-hicom said. the group said it will make the appropriate announcement(s) to bursa as and when necessary. the task force committee was set up in april this year as part of the governments approval of protons application for a soft loan of rm1.5 billion. the task force, which is led by performance management and delivery unit chief executive officer datuk seri idris jala, oversees the carmakers turnaround plan to make the company more competitive. under the plan, proton has to identify a foreign partner within a year to assist in research and development as part of its restructuring. drb-hicom was responding to a report by the edge weekly over the weekend that the group was expecting as many as seven bids for proton by the middle of this month and may even sell as much as 100% of the company to foreign buyers. the report quoted a source as saying that drb-hicom had made it clear that it was willing to sell up to 100% of proton, but how much it sells will depend on the proposals and prices it receives. it also reported that most of the bids had already been received with one or two more due before the mid-aug deadline. the edge had previously reported that french car manufacturers groupe psa and renault sa have been in talks with proton since the beginning of the year. other automakers that are said to be in the running are germanys volkswagen, americas general motors, japans suzuki motor corp, and at least one chinese automaker which is believed to be geely which owns swedish marque volvo. in a note to clients yesterday, cimb research believes that, this time around, there is a higher chance that the sale of proton to a foreign partner may succeed given the recent reorganisation in protons top level management and its need for further equity injection. the disposal is expected to boost the future earnings of drb-hicom as it will no longer need to consolidate the losses of proton, if it sells a 100% stake. the sale could also improve the groups net gearing ratio of 0.51 times as at march 31, 2016 and boost future cash flows, it said. cimb research is maintaining its earnings forecasts on drb-hicom pending further developments. a successful disposal of proton at a good price would act as a catalyst for protons share price, it added, retaining its add call on the stock and a rm1.60 target price. proton was established in 1983 by former prime minister tun dr mahathir mohamad. the carmaker has gone through several owners, including state investment fund khazanah nasional bhd before being acquired by drb-hicom in 2012. drb-hicom swung to a net loss of rm790.8 million in its fourth quarter ended march 31, 2016 (4qfy16) compared with a net profit of rm89.8 million a year ago, which it blamed largely on the poor performance of proton with lower sales of motor vehicles. drb-hicom saw its share price rise as much as 13 sen or 11.7% to hit an intraday high of rm1.24, before ending the day at rm1.16, up five sen or 4.5%, for a market capitalisation of rm2.26 billion. the stock has been been on a steady climb, appreciating as

markets concerns about the implications of this planned rm2.8 billion deal ever since it was announced in june 2015. the last official announcement to bursa malaysia by fgv on this issue on dec 1, 2015 was that the agreements to purchase a 37% stake in eagle high and rajawali sugar assets will no longer be applicable. an official announcement that fgv is no longer buying a stake in eagle high could act as one of four potential catalysts for the stock. we had earlier voiced our concerns that the eagle high acquisition could dilute fgvs shareholders funds if the stake is bought at a premium to market price. the other three catalysts are: i) plans to cut rm100 million administrative costs in financial year 2016; ii) improving fresh fruit bunch (ffb) yields via better agronomic practices; and iii) sale of assets that are loss-making. fgvs share price was rm1.86 on the day it announced plans to acquire eagle high. the planned acquisition, coupled with disappointing earnings, has pushed down its share price to as low as rm1.19, before rebounding recently. we expect the stock to be rerated when fgv officially announces that it is no longer eyeing eagle high. further rerating could be on the cards if zakaria delivers on the promise to cut costs, improve ffb yields and earnings, and focus on its core and profitable businesses. we maintain our non-consensus add rating on the stock, with a higher sum-of-parts (sop)-based tp of rm2.08. following the low likelihood of fgv acquiring a stake in eagle high, we have removed the 15% discount previously accorded to its sop to arrive at our tp. our revised sop implies a price-to-book-value of 1.2 times for the group, which is still attractive relative to its malaysian sector peers average of 1.9 times. downside risks include failure

also languid, compared to the tens of millions the counter usually generates. the guardian yesterday reported turkeys parliament approved a bill declaring a state of emergency, following last weekends

the istanbul sabiha gokcen international airport (isga) generates a significant amount of revenue. there were expectations that the airport, the only one outside malaysia that mahb currently owns, was going to finally be in the black this year. cimb investment bank bhd analyst raymond yap said in a note last saturday (july 16) that turkeys position as one of the worlds most visited countries can be threatened by the countrys political instability  from the kurdish emergency, to the islamic state threat, to the military-civilian conflict. yap then revised downwards its earnings estimates from isga, to only a breakeven level. just three months ago, he expected mahbs turkish airport to make a core profit of rm86.4 million. with that, cimbs target price for mahb was reduced to rm7.25, while

shareholding in neata aluminium (m) sdn bhd to 78.6%. the latter, in turn, wholly owns vivocom enterprise sdn bhd, a construction firm founded by yeoh. mercury securities sdn bhd head of research edmund tham said yeoh is seen as a key player in turning the company around, and the one who deals with china counterparties. thus, it is a concern for investors [if he were to step down]. if he is truly going to resign and the company is quiet on his successors appointment, this could impact the near-term sentiment on the stock, he told the edge financial daily over the telephone yesterday. vivocom shares have fallen by as much as 40.54% this year, from its high of 37 sen on may 13, despite analysts target prices that range from 50 sen (mercury securities) to 78 sen (cimb). yesterday, the stock rose by 5.88% to close at its intraday high of 27 sen, after it proposed a 1:4 bonus issue on tuesday. vivocom was the most active counter on bursa yesterday, with 79.19 million shares changing hands. tham said bonus issues, as in most cases, should be good for any companys shareholders. its warrants rose, too, all by half a sen each. vivocom-wb yesterday closed at 16.5 sen, while vivocom-wc ended the day at 16.5 sen and vivocom-wd settled at 18 sen. chan, however, is neutral on this exercise, saying the stock is already very liquid. while bonus issues typically boost retail investor interest in a stock that suffers from a lack of trading liquidity, vivocom does not have this problem. at the existing share base of 2.6 billion shares and a 57% free float, it is frequently already in the top 10 in terms of volume on bursa, he said."}, "277": {"date_posted": "13/7/2016", "title": "klci rises after bank negara rate cut; maybank down", "article": " kuala lumpur (july 13):

"278": {"date_posted": "13/7/2016", "title": "trade wise: brexit: gauging the contagion effect of brexit", "article": " this article first appeared in corporate, the edge malaysia weekly, on june 27 - july 3, 2016. while most analysts agree that malaysias fundamentals will not be significantly affected by britains withdrawal from the european union (brexit), many fear the spillover effects and inevitable uncertainties could weigh on the local economy and financial markets. nomura securities warned clients not to underestimate the depth and reach of financial market contagion to asia. in its note last friday, it says that taking the view that the financial and economic impact would only be limited to the uk due to its economic size is too simplistic for two reasons. first, we expect non-trivial spillover to the euro areas economy and financial markets. while the value of merchandise exports from the rest of the eu to the uk is only 3% of the rest of the eus gdp, the uks position as a global financial hub  the uk financial sectors assets account for more than eight times its gdp  leaves the rest of the eu much more exposed to the uk in terms of financial and investment linkages, in part reflecting the uks relatively liberalised domestic market and its strong legal framework and institutions, nomura says. secondly, it fears that brexit could further inflame anti-eu sentiment in other member states, increasing fears that they would also leave the union. asian equities and currencies tumbled last friday after 51.9% of the uk electorate voted to leave the eu the day before. the fbm klci declined 1.7% to 1,611 before recovering to 1,634. save for the south korean won, the ringgit was the hardest-hit among the major asian currencies, sliding 2.1% against the us dollar to 4.09. we believe that the overall implications of the vote to leave are negative for emerging currencies, particularly the central and eastern european currencies. in addition to this, currencies with large foreign portfolio exposure and wide external imbalances will also face large downside pressure. these currencies are also the most risk off currencies and include the indonesian rupiah, malaysian ringgit, turkish lira and brazilian real, writes hsbc global research in a recent report. nonetheless, the biggest victims of brexit appear to be the british pound and the uk and european markets. the pound took a pounding, depreciating 8% against the greenback while the euro stoxx and ftse lost 8.4% and 3.5% of their market value respectively in the first few hours of trading last friday. in contrast, us treasuries, the yen, the swiss franc and gold rose as investors flocked to safe-haven assets amid heightened market volatility. local brokers generally think that brexit will have a minimal impact on malaysia. hong leong investment bank in a june 24 report points out that malaysias trade with the uk amounted to only 1% of total exports while foreign direct investment from the uk in the 2008 to 2015 period averaged just 4% annually. hence, risk to malaysia emanates mainly from financial contagion. credit suisse in a recent note says only a handful of malaysian companies have significant exposure to the uk. indeed, only five companies in the fbm klci lost more than 2% of their market capitalisation last friday. out of the five, genting bhd, genting malaysia bhd and ytl corp bhd saw their shares decline 2.4% to 3.8%. the other two large caps are sapurakencana petroleum bhd and astro malaysia holdings bhd, which lost 4.3% and 3.8% of their market value respectively last friday. the increased market volatility we see today is due to the risk off sentiment, which dominates market sentiment following the brexit vote. as investors reverse their positions in risky assets and emerging markets, local bonds and equities and the ringgit will certainly be under selling pressure. meanwhile, we also saw the us and european stock index futures drop a few percentages, indicating that us and european shares are likely to fall when the markets open later, says areca capital ceo danny wong. that said, the selldown is just a knee-jerk reaction and is short term in nature. brexit would still require parliamentary approval and it could take up to two years to complete the process. positively, the odds of having two rate hikes this year are very low as the us fed turns more cautious on the outlook of the global economies. this is good news for emerging market equities, he adds. after the dust settles, investors will reassess the market situation and probably come back the asia  the only bright spot that offers decent growth in a low interest rate environment. the alternatives dont look attractive enough: us interest rates are too low while investors have largely turned more cautious towards european assets. therefore, the next couple of days could be a good time to capitalise on the brexit-induced share price weakness and accumulate blue-chip stocks such as tenaga nasional bhd or malayan banking bhd, wong concludes. the market turmoil is a natural flight to safety but its still too early to gauge the full impact. i think we have to wait and see how the us markets respond to brexit and how the asian markets respond to us shares on monday. so far, our local stock market has held up relatively well against its asian peers with the fbm klci still staying above 1,600. for instance, tokyo stock price index lost 8% and hang seng dropped 3% while fbm klci fell marginally by 0.4%. malaysian government securities saw yields rise but the amount was small, says etiqa insurance & takaful head of research chris eng. strategy-wise, watch the fbm klci on monday  after the us markets absorb the brexit news  on whether it can remain resilient and stay above 1,600. as the initial system shock from brexit subsides, and as the markets expect just one fed rate hike in 2016, i believe that the local stock market could gradually recover towards 4q. as such, if the index trades close to 1,600, its a pretty good entry point to accumulate stocks. however, if the index falls below 1,600, this will also set off another leg for a further fall, he adds. nonetheless, brexit is still a negative development for the global trade and economy. looking ahead, the further disintegration in the eu and the rise of populist politics are risks that investors need to watch out for. people shrugged off the possibility of rodrigo duterte becoming the president of the philippines, but it happened. then people thought that brexit was unlikely to materialise, but it happened. this november, we have the us presidential election and people dismiss the idea that populist candidate donald trump could be elected into office. if trump really becomes president of the us, this could have an adverse impact on global trades, economies and markets, eng concludes.  impact on sectors analysts do not expect brexit to directly impact malaysian banks as their exposure to the uk is very small. the uk-related loans of the largest bank, malayan banking bhd, amounted to rm1.27 billion as at end-march, or just 0.3% of total loans. cimb group holdings bhd, the second largest bank, had uk-related loans amounting to rm948 million, also just 0.3% of total loans. loans to the uk is really small, so i dont think therell be a direct impact. but there could be secondary effects, in that the banks may have exposure to companies that have high exposure to the uk, says a banking analyst with a local research brokerage. in a june 21 report, credit suisse notes a stronger british pound means higher ringgit revenue and profits (or vice versa), translated from the uk business units. ytl power international bhd leads the pack as some 24% of its revenue is derived from uk-based wessex water. the water and sewerage subsidiary in the uk contributes ~82% of ytl powers pre-tax earnings. this business will likely remain resilient after brexit. with over 40 casinos, genting malaysia is one of the largest casino operators in the uk. credit suisse estimates that genting malaysias uk operations will only contribute 2.5% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation in 2016e. genting is exposed to uk via its 49.3% stake in genting malaysia. the battersea power station project in the uk is owned by sime darby bhd and s p setia bhd (40% each), with the employees provident fund owning the remainder. a weaker economy will adversely affect the take-up in future property launches in the country. sime darbys property division will see associate profit contribution from battersea in the uk in fy2017. we estimate that battersea will make up about 11% of simes net profit. if the uk economy weakens, the worry is that future launches in battersea will be adversely impacted. the malaysian property market remains lacklustre, says credit suisse. the first phase is expected to be handed over progressively over a six-month period from december 2016 and the expected contribution to s p setias bottom line is about rm280 million, or 36% of consensus fy2017 estimates, it says. eco world development group bhd and eastern & oriental bhd have meaningful exposure to the uk as well. eco world international (ewi), in which the listed eco world will eventually hold a 30% stake upon its listing, has a huge exposure in the uk. as at january, ewi recorded u00a3712 million in property sales. e&o ventured to the uk in 2012 when it acquired princes house in central london. the project with an estimated gross development value of u00a360 million is slated for completion this year, in which revenue and profit will then be recognised. e&o recently aborted its proposal to list its uk-based property unit, e&o plc, on the london stock exchange. although the local bourses decline last friday was the smallest among the regions markets, the uncertainty over the global effects of brexit is likely to dampen investor sentiment in the coming weeks, until the dust settles and clarity emerges."}, "279": {"date_posted": "13/7/2016", "title": "cimb on vivocom: 'immediate focus on ceo tenure'", "article": "

neutral: findings from a survey of 21 planters by the cimb research futures team revealed that malaysian crude palm oil (cpo) output grew by 12.8% month-on- month (m-o-m) to 1.5 million tonnes in june 2016. palm oil exports fell approximately 10% m-o-m, based on export statistics released by sgs sa and intertek testing services na inc (its). overall, we estimate that malaysian palm oil inventories may rise 12% m-o-m to 1.85 million tonnes as at end-june 16, which is negative for prices. the official figures will be released on july 12. the 13% m-o-m rise in ffb output is above the historical average m-o-m rise in junes palm oil output of 1% over the past five years. this is higher than our earlier projections of flattish output and suggests that the worst of the el nino impact on yield may be over. on a year-on-year basis, cpo output fell 13% as the el nino continued to impact ffb yields. our survey revealed that sarawak estates posted the biggest rise in output of around 19% m-o-m, followed by sabah (+12.5% m-o-m) and peninsular malaysia (+6.9% m-o-m) estates. we estimate that malaysian palm oil exports declined by about 10% m-o-m in june 2016, based on estimates from cargo surveyor sgs (-11% m-o-m) and its (-8.4% m-o-m). this is a surprise to the market and below our initial projection of a 6% decline due mainly to weaker demand from india. the lower demand could be due to stiffer competition from other edible oils and paring down of stock reserves. potential impact of recent brexit vote on cpo prices: the recent brexit vote on june 23 could have negative repercussions that will spread beyond the uk and europe to the global economy. slower global growth will be negative for palm oil prices in us dollar terms as it could result in weaker demand growth for edible oils usage in food, oleochemicals and biodiesel. labour issues in 2h16 malaysias new national minimum wage comes came into effect on july 1, with monthly minimum wage rising from rm900 to rm1,000 for peninsular malaysia, and from rm800 to rm920 for sabah and sarawak. we estimate this will cut planters earnings by 2% to 5%. it is unclear if the ban on new foreign worker intake imposed since mid-march will be lifted following the june 30 expiry of the amnesty programme for foreign workers. an extension of the ban could aggravate the worker shortage situation in estates and affect ffb yields in second half. the average cpo price for 1h16 improved 13% y-o-y to rm2,517 per tonne, insufficient to offset the estimated 17% y-o-y drop in output from the malaysian estates over the same period. as such we project weaker y-o-y earnings in 1h16 for plantation companies. we expect cpo prices to trade in the range of rm2,300 to rm2,600 per tonne in july 2016 and average rm2,450 per

2,085.45. the fbm klci traded in a narrower range of 17.61 points for the week with sluggish volumes of 1.1 billion to 1.35 billion shares traded. the index rose 2.29 points and closed at 1,639.98 yesterday from the previous day as blue-chip stocks such as cimb group holdings bhd, genting malaysia bhd, kuala lumpur kepong bhd, maxis bhd and tenaga nasional bhd caused the index to inch up on minor buying activities. the ringgit firmed against the us dollar at 4.0220 as brent crude inched up to us$48.60 (rm195.37) per barrel. the fbm klci rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,671.82 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,503.68 (low), 1,727.41 (high), 1,600.92 (low) and 1,729.13 (high). the index managed to surpass the key 62% fibonacci retracement (fr) level of 1,728.54 to a recent high of 1,729.13 on april 14, 2016. very heavy liquidation at that level had caused the index to decline to a new low of 1,613.79 on june 16, 2016. the indexs price bars are now between the 20-day and 50-day daily simple moving averages (smas) and this depicts a sideward phase for the fbm klci in the short to medium term. however, medium- to longer-term prospects look bleaker as the daily 50-day and 200-day smas have issued a dead cross this month, and the weekly 50-day and 200-day smas have also issued a dead cross in november 2015. any bargain hunting on the index will be met by heavy longer-term selling on rallies. the indexs daily signals are mixed, with all its directional movement index and oscillator indicators showing very obvious sell signals. the commodity channel index (cci), moving average convergence divergence (macd) and stochastic remain positive for now. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at the 1,567, 1,600 and 1,619 levels, while very heavy liquidation at the resistance areas of 1,639, 1,664 and 1,729 will cap the indexs rise. the daily downside targets for the index are located at 1,596, 1,569 and 1,527. all rebounds on the

fbm klci, we are recommending a chart sell on malaysia building society bhd (mbsb). mbsb grants loans on the security of freehold and leasehold properties. a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that five research houses cover this stock, with four hold calls and one sell call. maybank investment bank bhd does not cover mbsb on a fundamental basis. mbsbs chart trend in the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is firmly down. from a daily wave c and recent all-time high of rm2.40 (october 2014), its share price has plunged 67.9% in the daily, weekly and monthly time frames to a weekly wave 3 low of 77.5 sen (june 2016). as prices broke above its recent key critical support levels of rm1.02 and rm1.19, look to sell mbsb on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term downtrend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, oscillator and stochastic) have issued very obvious sell signals, and now show firm and clear indications of mbsbs eventual plunge towards much lower levels. it would attract very weak buying activities at the support levels of 48 sen, 64 sen and 77.5 sen. we expect mbsb to witness very heavy activities at its resistance levels of 78.5 sen, rm1.02 and rm1.19. its clear downside targets are located at 23 sen, 48 sen, 57 sen and 76 sen. lee cheng hooi is the

one trader says the fall has more to do with trading psychology than the 1q earnings not meeting investors expectations. he explains that although vivocom has a very powerful and potent story, its penny stock status makes it easier for speculators to go in for an easy kill. punters probably quickly built up their positions upon hearing rumours that the results would be fantastic, and took profit once the results came out. if you look at what they have done to their share base through various corporate exercises, the direction is somewhat speculative. although the companys market capitalisation is more than rm800 million, its share price is only 32 sen due to the unusually large share base that makes it a top volume stock. they have come to the equity market to raise funds and it looks like they will need to raise a lot more capital, thereby diluting the earnings of existing shareholders  we will never know when the share placement stops, says a fund manager. although the stock appears cheap based on a fy2017 per of a mere six times and the company has a good chinese fdi story due to its connections with china railway construction corp ltd (crcc), its execution risk and cash flow issues are real. as we have seen in the past, there were companies with nice stories that just failed to execute and deliver. unlike established big players like gamuda, ijm corp or suncon, vivocom has a relatively short track record, so the big discount in valuation probably reflects the level of risks, he adds. however, cimb research analyst marcus chan disagrees that vivocom is a speculative stock. the recent drop in its share price has little to do with the companys fundamentals. as one of the top 10 most active stocks, its a reflection of the change in retail sentiment, which is affected by mscis weightage rebalancing that unfortunately coincided with vivocoms earnings release. so, im not too worried. in fact, the price weakness provides institutional investors with a good entry point into its shares. interestingly, off-market transactions compiled by bloomberg show that 7.8 million vivocom shares worth rm2.5 million were transacted in block trades from may 17 to 19, which are typically executed by institutional investors. this works out to an average transaction price of 32 sen per share, close to its open market prices of 32-33 sen on these three days. when asked whether vivocom faces a perception issue inherited from instacom, chan says it is now a totally different animal compared with instacom as the management and shareholders have changed. he adds that the new team has delivered in terms of financial performance in the past five to six months. as for cash flow concerns, as we win more jobs we definitely need more working capital to fund these projects. as a rule of thumb, we need rm10 million in working capital for every rm100 million job. since our outstanding order book has expanded to rm1 billion and other contracts are being finalised in the coming months, we will need more funding, people and resources to execute the jobs and help us grow, explains executive director choo seng choon. if we go to banks for borrowings, we need to pay a high 7% to 8% interest rate, an expense that would eat into our profits. but if we are able to grow our earnings by 200%, a 10% dilution in earnings is not that significant an impact. additionally, we welcome institutional investors to be our long-term shareholders to balance out our large retail investor base, he says. according to bloomberg data, mutual fund filings show that institutional investors held an aggregate 3.6% equity interest in the company as at march 31. vivocom is eyeing a transfer to bursa malaysias main market by the middle of next year, after meeting the profit requirement in fy2016 and having the financial years accounts audited. in a may 12 note to clients, cimb research says the strong 1q results should allay investor concerns about vivocoms execution ability. it raised its target price for the stock to 78 sen from 67 sen. meanwhile, midf research, in a recent note, reiterates its positive stance on the construction sector with vivocom as one of its top picks. maybank ib research notes that brokers are generally bullish on the stock as the street is forecasting a three-year 153% eps cagr for fy2015 to fy2018 against the backdrop of a strong job pipeline. the research house opines that a key parameter to monitor is the value of new job wins, which is crucial to confirm the bullish expectations of the stock.

oriental bhd (e&o) saw boardroom changes. its founder and managing director (md) datuk seri tham ka hon has been redesignated as executive deputy chairman effective july 1. tham, who is also a substantial shareholder in e&o, will be replaced by kok tuck cheong as md of e&o. meanwhile, it announced the resignation of eric chan kok leong as its board member and deputy md, citing \"expiry of contract and family reason\". on a separate matter, the property developer said it achieved record property sales amounting to rm1.1 billion for the financial year ended march 31, 2016 (fy16). \"we are responding to strong headwinds experienced by the industry at large, by adopting prudent cashflow management, restrategising and intensifying its marketing efforts, including extending its marketing reach and initiating new approaches to drive sales for its projects across penang, iskandar malaysia in johor and the klang valley,\" said tham. e&o sank into red with a net loss of rm14.78 million or 1.18 sen loss per share in the fourth quarter ended march 31, 2016 (4qfy16) compared to a net profit of rm100.5 million or 8.22 sen per share a year ago, mainly due to lower revenue recognition from its property projects. revenue, however, rose 4.2% to rm149.03 million in 4qfy16 from rm143.04 million in 4qfy15. the lower quarterly earnings also brought down its annual profit by 75.8% to rm36.8 million from rm152.09 million in fy15. revenue dropped 6.3% to rm421.22 million from rm449.5 million, mainly due to lower revenue from its property segment. nevertheless, the group expects improved performance and results for fy17. versatile creative bhd, which was slapped with two unusual market activity (uma) queries from bursa malaysia this month, disclosed that it has received an offer to undertake the construction of a plant. without specifying the details of the contract, the paperboard packaging products manufacturer said its board intends to deliberate on the offer as soon as possible. \"pending a resolution to be passed by the board to accept the offer subject to certain conditions, the company shall engage an independent adviser to advise the company on the same,\" it added in a filing to bursa today. it also advised investors to trade its shares cautiously as there is no certainty that it will be taking on the project. airasia bhd reported a near six-fold jump in net profit for the first quarter ended march 31, 2016 (1qfy16) to rm877.79 million from rm149.33 million a year earlier, underpinned by higher passenger traffic and lower fuel costs. quarterly revenue was 31% higher at rm1.7 billion from rm1.3 billion, on the back of a 17% growth in the number of passengers carried to 6.48 million from 5.54 million. according to the low-cost carrier, the passenger growth was well ahead of the 3% capacity growth, allowing the company to record a high load factor of 85%, it added in a statement. moving forward, airasia bhd's group chief executive officer tan sri tony fernandes said: \"in malaysia, we are seeing robust demand despite the weaker consumer sentiment and domestic economy. in addition, the trend of local consumers trading down when going on their travel still persists while foreign nationals are still eyeing malaysia as a value for money holiday destination due to our weaker currency.\" he added that demand from chinese travellers has recovered with a 37% jump in the number of chinese guests flying into malaysia during 1qfy16. as for the cost going forward, he said the group's efforts to hedge 75% of its fuel requirements at an average cost of us$55 (rm223.56) per barrel have \"paid off\", and it is now relatively insulated from global fuel prices' volatility in the coming quarters. cimb group holdings bhd's net profit for the first quarter ended march 31, 2016 (1qfy16) jumped 40.3% year-on-year (y-o-y) to rm813.8 million or 9.54 sen per share from rm580.12 million or 6.9 sen per share in the previous year, on lower costs and provisions. it is worth noting that cimb incurred massive rm202 million investment banking restructuring costs in the previous corresponding quarter. the banking group told stock exchange today its revenue or operating income for the period rose 1.2% to rm3.73 billion from rm3.68 billion a year prior. \"the group posted a respectable performance for 1qfy16 despite the difficult operating conditions across the region, with y-o-y improvements in our consumer, wholesale banking and group asset management and investments divisions,\" said cimb group chief executive tengku datuk seri zafrul aziz in a statement. the group said net profit for the quarter improved 4% compared to the business as usual 1qfy15 net profit of rm782 million, attributed to its strict cost control initiatives and declining provision levels. in terms of key operating ratios, the group's loan to deposit ratio stood at 90.6% in 1qfy16 compared to 90.3% in 1qfy15, gross impaired loans ratio improved to 3% from 3.2%, while its cost to income ratio was lower at 57.4%, compared to 58% in the previous year. its net interest margins were lower at 2.62%, attributed to the higher cost of deposits in malaysia. cimb's total capital ratio stood at 15.4%, while the common equity tier 1 capital ratio strengthened to 10.6%. looking ahead, tengku zafrul said it will continue to adopt a cautious view on overall balance sheet growth, focusing on cost management, asset quality, capital management and governance, amid the challenging environment. brahim's holdings bhd, which posted its fourth consecutive quarter of net loss in the financial quarter ended march 31, 2016, said the collaboration between its 51%-owned subsidiary brahim's sats food services sdn bhd and 7-eleven malaysia sdn bhd, a subsidiary of 7-eleven malaysia holdings bhd, has come into effect, following the signing of a service agreement, its bourse filing revealed today. under the partnership, brahim's sats will plan, develop, and create menu specifications and products to be marketed through 7-eleven's convenience stores. in turn, 7-eleven will provide a centralised distribution centre for brahim's sats to deliver its products. meanwhile, in separate filings to the exchange, brahim's said its memorandums of understanding (mous) with servair investissments aeroportuaries (s.i.a.) and dhyafat albalad alameen co ltd have lapsed. to recap, brahim's and s.i.a., which is a subsidiary of french airline catering company servair, had entered into the mou on jan 21, 2015 to collaborate and improve commercial and industrial cooperation in airline catering business based on each other's 'know-how' competency. the objective of the mou was to draw on the parties' core competencies in the airline catering business and airport services. additionally it was to enable brahim's to benefit from using the servair brand mark and for s.i.a. to tap into brahim's halal certification expertise. pipe maker engtex group bhd has bagged a rm25 million contract from syarikat bekalan air selangor sdn bhd (syabas) to supply ductile iron (di) pipes as part of selangor's water pipe replacement programme. engtex group md datuk ng hook said in a statement today the contract was a positive step in the state's initiatives to replace ageing and leaking pipes in the water distribution system. ng added that the group intends to invest about rm15 million in capital expenditure (capex) in order to enhance its competitive edge in view of higher anticipated demand in the future. he said the capex would be for new machinery to increase the di pipe diameter from current 800 mm to 1,200 mm, as well as to expand its mild steel pipe production capacity from 42,000 metric tonnes (mt) to 66,000 mt per annum. with the latest contract, it brings engtex's outstanding order book to rm109 million. it is also tendering for projects worth about rm507 million both from the public and private sector. malaysian resources corp bhd (mrcb) has been appointed as a project delivery partner (pdp) to develop the kwasa damansara township's main infrastructure by employees provident fund's (epf) wholly-owned unit kwasa land sdn bhd today. kwasa damansara is a future township within 932ha (2,330 acres) in sungai buloh, selangor. the rubber research institute malaysia was formerly located there. mrcb said in a statement today, its wholly-owned subsidiary mrcb builders sdn bhd would earn a pdp fee of 5% of the development cost estimated at rm2.2 billion. the pdp work scope, the group said, included project management related to the design, procurement and construction of the main infrastructure within 640ha (1,600 acres). ijm corp bhd saw a 54.98% year-on-year drop in its final quarter ended march 31, 2016 (4qfy16) at rm44.24 million, mainly due to lower contributions from the construction, property development, and manufacturing and quarrying divisions. the diversified conglomerate told stock exchange that its bottom line was dampened by net unrealised foreign exchange losses. revenue fell 19% to rm1.17 billion, as there were smaller year-on-year sales contribution from ijm corp's property development, manufacturing and quarrying, plantation, and infrastructure businesses. in a separate statement, ijm corp declared a total dividend of seven sen a share, comprising a special dividend of three sen a share and a single-tier second interim dividend of four sen a share. in total, its dividends in fy16 amount to 10 sen a share. \"the total interim dividend of seven sen per share declared in fy16 represents an increase from the 15 sen per share last year, after taking into account the expanded share capital base due to new shares issued as part of the consideration for the privatisation of ijm land bhd and the subsequent one-for-one bonus share issue to reward shareholders in 2015,\" said its group chief executive officer and md datuk soam heng choon. for the full year (fy16), ijm corp's net profit grew by 65% to rm793.59 million from rm480.94 million a year earlier. revenue, however, inched down by 5.87% to rm5.13 billion from rm5.45 billion, as its property development and plantation divisions brought in fewer sales.

orders data showed weakness in business spending plans, while world stock indexes edged higher, extending recent gains, according to reuters, adding that u.s. oil prices closed slightly lower after earlier topping $50 a barrel for the first time in about seven months. it said the dow jones industrial average was down 17.16 points, or 0.1 percent, to 17,834.35, the s&p 500 gained 1.19 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,091.73 and the nasdaq composite added 9.51 points, or 0.19 percent, to 4,904.40. msci's all-country world stock index rose 0.3 percent, while the ftseurofirst 300 closed up 0.2 percent, it said. alliancedbs research in its evening edition thursday said despite the last few minutes buying of selective blue chip stocks to prop up the benchmark index to settle near the days high in the preceding day, the fbm klci had on may 26 opened the day on a weak note as market participants were unwilling to take the chance of staging an immediate follow through buying support. however, non-follow through selling pressure in the area of 1,628.19 saw risk taking buying interest chipping in. it said this lifted the index to a high of 1,638.17 before settling near the days low at 1,631.09 (up 0.13 points or 0.01%). in the broader market, losers outnumbered gainers with 475 stocks ending lower and 315 stocks finishing higher. that gave a market breadth of 0.66 indicating the bears were in control, it said. alliancedbs research said that having run into resistance at 1,637 in the last 6 days, the benchmark index finally crossed over the 1,637 hurdle on may 26. but, the market could not sustain its position above the 1,637 level as market participants were still reluctant to be more aggressive in buying game. this can be seen from the fall back below the 1,637 level with a settlement of 1,631.09 on may 26. while the 1,637 level remains a hurdle, the short-lived crossover of 1,637 on may 26 should open up the room for more buying attempts to carry the market higher with buying momentum expected to gather pace if the market were to overcome the subsequent 1,637 hurdle again, it said. it said a decisive crossover of 1,637 should see a test of new resistance selling zone, 1,645 u2013 1,652, adding that indicator wise, the macd is above the 9-day moving average line. the analysis of overall market action on may 26 revealed that buying power was stronger than selling pressure. as such, the fbm klci would likely trade above the 1,638.17 level on may 27, said alliancedbs research. based on corporate announcements and news flow yesterday, companies that may be in focus today could include the following: eastern & oriental bhd, versatile creative bhd, airasia bhd, cimb group holdings bhd, brahim's holdings bhd, 7-eleven malaysia holdings bhd, engtex

year-on-year (y-o-y) due to the 18% appreciation of the us dollar against the ringgit. essentially, the us dollar revenue rose marginally by 1.1% y-o-y from us$7.17 million in 1qfy15 to us$7.25 million (rm29 million) in 1qfy16. overall, uchis 1qfy16 core net profit was flat y-o-y, after adjusting for unrealised gains on derivative instruments of rm300,000 and unrealised losses on foreign exchange of rm2.9 million. on a quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) basis, the groups revenue rose marginally by 0.7% due to the strengthening of the ringgit against the us dollar. uchis revenue in us dollar terms rose by a steeper 2.3% q-o-q. in terms of product mix, the management highlighted that revenue contribution from the art-of living (al) segment was stable q-o-q, at 77% of group revenue in 1qfy16, while the biotech segment contributed the remaining 23%. as expected, no dividends were declared for the quarter. uchi typically declares dividends in the second half. the management guides for flat revenue growth in fy16, given the tepid demand outlook for its al products and uncertainty in timing of new biotech product launches. it has no plans for capacity expansion this year and is only allocating rm5 million capital expenditure for fy16. in terms of product pipeline, uchi is looking to launch the new deep freezer control module in 2016, following delays in obtaining customer approvals in 2015. the management expects to complete the bonus issue exercise in june 2016, after getting shareholders approval in may. although the bonus issue will not alter the companys fundamentals, we are positive on the exercise as it should boost the stocks liquidity and improve near-term trading sentiment. dividends are the bright spot. uchis financial position remains strong, with a healthy net cash balance of rm167 million at end-march 2016. hence, we think there is ample room for the company to increase its dividend payout. to recap, uchi has a minimum dividend payout policy of 70% of annual net profit and the company has paid over 80% historically. we maintain our hold rating with an unchanged tp of rm1.71, based on 11.3 times calendar year 2017 price-earnings ratio (per) [at a 25% discount to target market per of 15 times]. uchi offers an attractive fy16 dividend yield of 6.8%, but we prefer inari-amertron bhd for its stronger earnings growth outlook and

first appeared in the edge financial daily, on may 16, 2016.  kuala lumpur: it has been two years since the burst of the oil boom and even longer for the puncture of the global commodity boom, in which prices were at multi-decade peaks, if not record highs. with the global surplus that fuelled oils decline projected to shift to deficit as us shale output falls, and the advent of the el nino phenomenon, crude oil and crude palm oil (cpo) bulls, although not that many as yet, are emerging now amid view that the downside risks have mostly known. last week, the international energy agency said it is forecasting the global oil supply surplus to ease substantially by year end, which should push the market towards much anticipated balance after a volatile couple of years, reuters reported. despite concerns about an economic slowdown, oil demand grew more than expected in the first quarter. there was strong demand in india, china and russia. dr mark mobius, templeton franklin emerging markets groups executive chairman, said he sees cherries ripe for the picking in the malaysian market, fuelled by an undervalued currency, inexpensive valuations of stocks and a stable government. he said well-integrated oil and gas (o&g) stocks are one area the fund manager believes could pique investor appetite. the major sectors we like now are the integrated oil companies, the companies that are not only in production and exploration, but also in refining and marketing, he said at a press conference on the sidelines of the global islamic finance forum 5.0 last week. areca capital sdn bhd chief executive officer danny wong told the edge financial daily last friday that taking a one- to two-year view, these stocks are worth a second look now. midf research analyst aaron tan said it may be time to accumulate o&g stocks now, but with caution. he said as most of the o&g players in malaysia are service providers, lacklustre oil prices have heavily weighed down on charter rates and impacted availability of jobs. if you look at icon offshore bhd, which won the exxonmobil [rm42 million vessel supply] contract recently, the charter rates are very, very low, he said when contacted, adding that charter rates of service providers have reduced from us$2 per brake horsepower per day during the heyday of high oil prices to us$1.60 per brake horsepower per day. the companies will still make money, but unlike in the heyday when you were making a 30% margin, perhaps now you will be making [a] less than 10% margin. in a note on april 7, tan said o&g companies to look out for are those that are involved in petroliam nasional bhds refinery and petrochemical integrated development project and downstream activities to ride on a potential upside in crude oil prices. the research firm also has a buy call on sapurakencana petroleum bhd. skp (sapurakencana) covers 90% of the value chain. since the drop in oil prices in 2014, we found the correlation between prices and skp is very strong, around 90%, he said. so you can say that you dont need to know anything about skp; [you] only need to have an outlook on oil prices, he added. crude oil prices have been hovering around the us$45 per barrel range. it has recovered almost 50% from the trough, but it is still not half of its recent peak at around us$100 per barrel. analysts have projected that oil prices could trade up to us$50 per barrel in the second half of 2016. on the other hand, the outlook for cpo prices could be promising too. we expect cpo prices to trade in the range of rm2,500 to rm2,900 per tonne in may this year, and an average of rm2,450 per tonne for 2016 and rm2,600 for 2017, said cimb research in a research note dated may 10 commenting on the palm oil inventory that declined to a 14-month low at end-april. the third-month futures cpo contract has climbed 14.44% over the past one year. year to date, it has declined 1.02%. however, cimb analyst ivy ng isnt upbeat about the earnings of plantation firms. she expects planters to post weaker first quarter of financial year 2016 (1qfy16) earnings on a year-on-year basis, as the impact of higher cpo prices will be offset by lower production volume. the rise in cpo prices is not sufficient to offset lower output due to competition from other edible oils and weaker demand from china, she explained. midf analyst alan lim noted that plantation stock prices have gone up in line with rising cpo prices. however, there are still bargains in the sector. the research firms top pick is kuala lumpur kepong bhd as the company has a high exposure to the palm oil business. it is also one of the rare index-linked companies which are syariah-compliant counters and is also a member of the roundtable on sustainable palm oil. another company we like is ppb group bhd because the share price has declined quite substantially and we see value after its share price declined because wilmar international ltds 1qfy16 results are in line, he added. ppb group holds a 18.6% stake in wilmar."}, "298": {"date_posted": "13/5/2016", "title": "klci falls to lowest point since february on msci rebalancing, softer 1q gdp",

by familymart's entry, says much to learn from japanese", "article": " this article first appeared in corporate, the edge malaysia weekly, on april 25 - may 1, 2016. convenience store operations are big business in japan. most are successful simply because they find ways to fulfil customer needs. they are well-stocked with fresh food and, more importantly, they are clean, staffed with helpful personnel and offer competitively priced products. it is no surprise, then, that when local poultry giant ql resources bhd revealed its plan to bring the familymart franchise to malaysia, netizens flooded social media to express their support and excitement about the entrance of the popular japanese convenience store chain. 7-eleven malaysia holdings bhd, the countrys largest convenience store chain operator, is now facing stiffer competition and its ceo and executive director gary thomas brown concedes that there is still much to learn from japanese convenience stores. we look a lot at japan because we think it is the best convenience store market in the world. i was there last month and we spent a lot of time studying their market. frankly, we try to copy things that look applicable to malaysia. shamelessly, we must admit, because they are really good at it, brown tells the edge in an interview last week. 7-eleven malaysia, a 53.4%-owned subsidiary of berjaya retail bhd, which is controlled by tycoon tan sri vincent tan, has been an icon of 24-hour convenience stores in malaysia for over 30 years. as at dec 31 last year, 7-eleven malaysia operated 1,944 stores and commanded about 80% of the stand-alone convenience store sector. brown says 7-eleven malaysia is learning from the japanese convenience stores the concept of true convenience, such as providing fresh food and beverages, as well as bill payment services at its stores. we see this as a big trend. we now offer coffee in about 1,000 stores. that is a very big push for us. you can come to have a cup of coffee, buy nasi lemak, pay your water bill ... and sit down to do all that, he adds.  we also provide seating at 95% of our new stores. you can do multiple purchases and tasks in nice surroundings. parcel lockers will also be available at 7-eleven stores nationwide soon, says brown. through its partnership with parcel locker operator boxit holdings sdn bhd, 500 parcel locker machines will be installed in certain stores within the next two years. that is a service, but it also brings potential customers to our stores. we want to convert these people into our customers so they visit more often and spend more, he says. brown, a 57-year-old australian, joined 7-eleven malaysia as deputy ceo in december 2013 before he was promoted to his current post in august 2014. earlier this month, ql resources announced that it plans to invest rm80 million to rm100 million in its venture with familymart, the second largest convenience store network in the world. the group intends to open as many as 300 outlets here within five years, with the first to be operational by end-2016. on average, ql resources will open 60 familymart stores per year. however, brown believes there is no reason for 7-eleven malaysia to pull back its aggressive plan to open 200 stores per year for at least the next 10 years. the expansion of new stores and the refurbishment of old stores is expected to cost rm85 million to rm90 million a year. there is nothing in the announcement [from ql resources] that would make us rethink our strategy. in fact, it only reinforces or reaffirms that our strategy and expansion plan are correct. he says it is too early to say whether familymart will become a big threat to 7-eleven malaysia. we certainly respect them as a potential competitor because 300 stores in five years will give them some scale. but if you look at the dynamics of it, five years later, we [7-eleven malaysia] are going to have 3,000 stores, out of which 1,000 are new stores, while they will have 300 stores. thats a big difference, he says, adding that 7-eleven malaysia is determined to maintain its pole position. brown also warns that it is not easy for a newcomer to enter the convenience retailing market and make an impact, even for the likes of circle k, one of north americas most popular operators. circle k is another prominent brand of convenience stores, and one that we respect. three years ago, they announced that they would have 500 stores in five years. as of today, they have fewer than 10 stores, he says. it is worth noting that airline caterer brahims holdings bhd has signed a memorandum of understanding with 7-eleven malaysia on april 15 to supply food to the latters stores. brahims will develop menu specifications and products to be marketed through 7-eleven malaysias nationwide chain of convenience stores, while the latter will provide a centralised distribution centre to deliver all products manufactured by the former.  brown says he is excited about the collaboration with brahims, as its ready-to-eat meals and ready-to-heat foods are halal, which will appeal to 7-eleven malaysias customer base. the opportunity to work with brahims is fantastic. it has a large kitchen facility and it can supply to any number of our stores, so thats a perfect situation for us, he says. on 7-eleven malaysias financial results, brown expects the financial year ending dec 31, 2016 (fy2016), to be better than fy2015. certainly, we can expect growth in revenue and profit this year. i also expect fy2017 to be a better year as consumer sentiment and spending are set to rebound, he says. in fy2015, 7-eleven saw its net profit decline 11.5% to rm55.8 million, compared with rm63.1 million the previous year. the weaker earnings performance was attributed to higher selling and distribution expenses from new store expansion. the groups revenue, however, rose 6% to rm2 billion from rm1.89 billion in fy2014, driven by growth in new stores, improved merchandise mix and consumer promotion activities. brown says the implementation of the goods and services tax (gst) in april last year, as well as a significant decline in consumer confidence and spending to a 10-year low in the third quarter, had dampened the groups overall financial performance in fy2015. when the gst came along, the sales tax was abolished. as we cannot capture gst in our sales, our revenue automatically declined by 6%. in other words, when i sold the same product, i lost 6% post-gst for doing nothing differently, and it was very hard to cover that, he says. year to date, shares of 7-eleven malaysia have fallen 8.2% to rm1.39, giving it a market capitalisation of rm1.63 billion. rhb research, cimb research and maybank ib have hold calls on 7-eleven malaysia, while ubs has a sell. according to bloomberg, the stock has a consensus target price of rm1.43, representing an upside of only 2.9%."}, "302": {"date_posted": "11/5/2016", "title":

while mercury securities sees the stock reaching 69 sen by end-2017. mercurys 48.5 sen end-2016 target price implies a 54% upside potential. vivocom should see a strong share performance over the next three months, on the back of multiple rerating catalysts, including a strong first quarter 2016 earnings release in may, cimb research analyst marcus chan says in an april 8 note. in addition to the companys projects in hand of rm1.2 billion (12 times its 2015 revenue), analysts expect it to clinch infrastructure contracts worth rm1.4 billion from crcc malaysia bhd. the latter is a subsidiary of state-owned china railway construction corp ltd, which has amassed a whopping rm16 billion order book since its entry into malaysia three years ago. vivocom currently trades at about five times

it fulfils the profit requirements.  aggressive investors who wish to gain exposure to the increasing chinese foreign direct investment in malaysias infrastructure projects can consider vivocoms three warrants, all of which have one-to-one conversion ratios and offer a lower cost of entry into the stock. at their respective close last wednesday, vivocom-wc and vivocom-wd were trading at zero

the derivative is up 900% from its 52-week low of 1.5 sen in august last year. assuming the warrants trade at zero premium and the mother share reaches mercurys end-2016 target price of 48.5 sen, vivocom-wc and vivocom-wd  which have a strike price of 10 sen  should be worth 38.5 sen, up 71% from last wednesdays close of 22.5 sen. in a similar vein, vivocom-wb  which has a strike price of 24

price (tp) of rm 51.00: british american tobacco (m) bhds (bat) share price has tumbled 13.4% since its first quarter of financial year 2016 (1qfy16) results were announced. we believe the sell-off was due to concerns over its declining sales volume, which led to a 27.9% year-on-year (y-o- y) earnings decline in 1qfy16.  to recap, monthly legal industry volumes declined by 29.7%, while bat recorded a steeper volume drop of 34.1%. furthermore, contraband cigarette volumes spiked to an all-time high of 45.6% in march 2016 as customers turn to cheaper alternatives. at current prices, the stock is worth a revisit, in our view, given its compelling dividend yields of 5.5% to 5.9% for fy2016 to fy2018 forward (fy16 to fy18f), sales volume showing a month-on-mocompanys unexciting earnings outlook due to uncertainties surrounding its restructuring plans. we also see a limited downside risk to the share price, thanks to the support from its dividend yields. furthermore, we believe that the market has yet to price in positives from its restructuring plans. to recap, bat will cease all manufacturing activities by the second half of 2017, and focus solely on local retail activities using outsourced products from selected regional bat factories. we note that management is confident that overall margins can increase with its restructuring plans. this is after taking into account that it is no longer sustainable to manufacture locally, given its underutilised capacity and the yearly hikes in duties. we also do not discount the group potentially declaring a special dividend from the proceeds from its land sale. based on our back-of-the-envelope calculations, the groups 504,885 sq ft land should be worth an estimated rm227.2 million to rm252.4 million, based on rm450 to rm500 per sq ft. this could translate into a special dividend of 71 sen to 78 sen per share, based conservatively on 80% of the proceeds returned to shareholders.  we make no changes to our earnings estimates and dividend discount model-based tp of rm51. in our view, the pullback in share price is overdone at this juncture and positives have emerged in the stock at these levels. we expect investors to begin seeing value in the groups restructuring plans, while taking into account the reduced risk of excise duty hikes and expected recovery in sales volume.  cimb research, may 10"},

24, 2016. with the bank of japan pursuing negative interest rates in january, joining its counterparts in the eurozone and switzerland in slashing interest rates below zero, investors were forced to choose between accepting potentially negative returns or allocating capital to riskier assets. according to bloomberg, more than us$7 trillion or 29% of global developed sovereign bonds offer yields below zero, meaning investors who buy the bonds and hold them to maturity will not get all their money back. negative interest rates in europe and japan, coupled with the dovish stance adopted by the us federal reserve, seem to have lifted risk appetite and driven liquidity to emerging markets, including malaysia. year to date, the msci ac asia ex-japan index has seen a rebound of 2.1% while the fbm klci is up 1.3%, thanks to a gradual recovery in oil prices from a multi-year low in january (see chart 1). indeed, midf researchs fund flow report shows that foreign investors have turned net buyers of malaysian equities with a cumulative year-to-date net inflow of rm5.9 billion, albeit relatively low compared with the net outflow of rm19.5 billion for the whole of 2015. over in the bond market, foreign investors purchased rm11.5 billion of ringgit debt securities in march, driving the five-year malaysian government securities (mgs) yield further down to 3.4% from a one-year high of 4.1% last august. one of the prime beneficiaries of falling mgs yields are perhaps malaysian real estate investment trusts (mreits), which offer higher yields of 5% to 8% compared with those offered by government bonds. specifically, retail reits with strong underlying assets such as igb reit (high occupancy rate), as well as pavilion reit and sunway reit (visible acquisition pipeline) have fared pretty well  their unit prices are up 12% to 16% year to date. looking ahead, analysts opine that mreits will continue to benefit from the fall in mgs yields if there are further delays in fed policy rate hikes. mreits are certainly not the sole beneficiary. as shown in chart 2, large caps led the pack in terms of share price performance in the first quarter of the year (1q2016) with a 1.5% gain, beating mid caps 1.2% increase and a negative return of 1.4% seen by small caps. based on various sectors performance in 1q2016, it seems that although investors have turned bullish, they are selective when it comes to stock picking and they go for three things  blue chips, defensive earnings and cheap valuation. conglomerates were obviously the big winners (see chart 3). genting bhd saw a 33.5% surge in its share price  a rare performance that has not been seen since 2013  while hap seng consolidated bhd was up more than 20% to an all-time high of rm7.75 in march. tenaga nasional bhd, the second largest bursa malaysia-listed company by market capitalisation, rose 4.7% in 1q2016. one of the largest vertically integrated utilities in asia, the state-controlled firm is the top pick of many analysts with its 2016 earnings before interest and taxes (ebit) expected to rise to rm8.6 billion, double the level six years ago. for banks, now trading at 2008 financial crisis valuations, asset quality and size seemed to be the share price drivers in 1q2016. hong leong financial group bhd and alliance financial group bhd, two cheaper banks with the lowest gross impaired loan ratios after public bank bhd, gained 16.6% and 11.2% respectively. meanwhile, the share prices of the countrys two largest banks by assets, malayan banking bhd and cimb bank bhd, were also up by about 7%. developers, which are also trading at trough valuations, have fared fairly well too. ioi properties group bhd and sunway bhd, two of the countrys largest property developers, saw their share prices rise 20.2% and 12.3% respectively in 1q2016. the share prices of smaller players such as mkh bhd, matrix concepts holdings bhd and lbs bina group bhd also gained between 2% and 12%, thanks in part to their affordable housing focus. in contrast, export-oriented technology stocks and glove makers were hit hardest by the increased confidence in the ringgit, losing some 22.2% and 12% respectively of their market value in the first quarter. while there have been no signs of weakening earnings thus far, the real test lies in the upcoming 1q2016 quarterly results  to be released next month  which will capture the impact of the stronger ringgit. investors should keep a close eye on companies with resilient external demand as much of the negative sentiments may have already been priced into their current share prices. even in the first few weeks of 2q2016, many of the best-performing large caps continued their upward march. while bulls cite cheap valuations and further monetary easing by major central banks as reasons to be bullish, bears say earnings are still seeing downward pressure amid the volatile markets. this begs the question, is the perfect storm finally over or is it simply a dead cat bounce? in a recent note to clients, cimb research says the us dollar could be the key that determines the performance of global equity and commodity markets this year. the research house is of the view that the recent strengthening of asian currencies such as the ringgit is only a short-term rebound. the us dollar, which has been trading sideways in the past year, could consolidate for another few months before experiencing a strong and sharp rally in the second half of 2016. the bullish multi-year super cycle of the us dollar is not likely to end anytime soon. but analysts recommend taking a shorter investment horizon and keeping an eye on the greenback amid heightened market volatility, which came about due to the contest between cheap money and weaker earnings. other analysts advocate overweighting cash to take advantage of any volatility that creates a once-in-a-decade opportunity to accumulate quality assets at attractive prices. in the meantime, all eyes will be on the feds statement when it meets on april 26 and 27. it could offer more clarity on the direction of future rate hikes, which would influence the us dollar.

suspension of the roundtable on sustainable palm oil (rspo) certification of ioi corp bhds palm oil production  which came into effect last friday  would have really stung the integrated plantation giant. after all, the company was one of the founding members of the rspo, and this is the second time it has been suspended for non-compliance of certain principles and criteria. this time around, the complaint against ioi corp was made by aid environment on april 3 last year regarding its plantation subsidiaries in indonesia  pt sukses karya sawit, pt berkat nabati sawit and pt bumi sawit sejahtera  for allegedly violating several rspo principles and criteria. these include no new planting policy published, no challenging time-bound plans, land clearing without iup (izin usaha perkebunan), fraudulent statement on activity on the ground, no concession boundary filed, encroachment and deep peat clearance. the time frame of the suspension is undetermined, pending a comprehensive plan of remediation and the implementation of the plan by ioi corp. the suspension of its rspo certificate could come as a blow to ioi corp, given the significant dealings of its downstream business in europe and the us, say industry experts. in an email reply to questions from the edge, ioi corp says about two-thirds of its speciality oils and fats business is derived from europe and the us. the speciality oils and fats business contributes 11% to the groups overall earnings before interest and tax, it adds. we are unable to quantify the potential sales loss at the moment, pending our appeal and clarification of the scope and content of the suspension from rspo, says ioi corp on how the suspension will affect its earnings going forward. it is worth noting that the replies were received on the same day that the group met the rspo complaints panel to discuss and review its action plan. based on ioi corps 2015 annual report, resource-based manufacturing, which includes refineries, oleochemicals and speciality oils and fats, contributed 28% to group earnings. the groups downstream refining manufacturer, ioi loders croklaan, which is a leading supplier of certified sustainable palm oil (cspo) products in europe, says in a recent statement that the full suspension of the groups certificate will have a significant negative impact on the markets uptake of cspo. it will hurt over 300 rspo members that are currently taking segregated certificate and mass-balance certificate products and which themselves are committed to change through using physical rspo-certified oil, explains its ceo julian veitch.  ta securities research, in a report, points out, the suspension of rspo certification will not be favourable to european and north american customers, who are increasingly erecting barriers to non-certified crude palm oil imports. note that downstream operation constituted 28% of iois total operating profit in fy2015 and it derived more than 50% of its revenue from europe and north america. cimb research estimates that the cspo premium on ioi corps palm oil is valued at rm58 million based on the companys guidance that the premium represents less than 0.5% of revenue. based on this, the impact on our fy2017 (ending june 30) net profit works out to around 3.5%. however, this does not take into account potential loss of customers or additional costs incurred to purchase cspo from third parties to fulfil contracted volumes to customers. while cspo premium accounts for only a small portion of ioi corps revenue, a plantation analyst says the actual impact of the suspension is more complicated than just the premium because end-product markets tend to have their own supply and demand structure. last friday, the rspo released a working paper that offered solutions to the plantation group to mitigate unintended consequences to stakeholders within its supply chain. however, it appears that this would come out of ioi corps pockets. some of the issues that were addressed include greenpalm certificates that are sold by a certified mill. ioi corp would have to buy back oversold gp certificates, if any, beyond april 4, given the suspension. also, ioi corp would now have to buy crude palm oil from a certified mill and sell it to a certified refinery and buy back the refined products to sell to its customers. nevertheless, the rspo complaints panel admits that there could be a problem in the case of ioi corps tailor-made products from its speciality oils and fats refinery in wormerveer, the netherlands. the suspension of ioi corps rspo certification, however, did not seem to bother its investors because the stock fell a mere 2.4% to rm4.54 last friday from rm4.65 on march 25, when the suspension was announced. that said, filings with bursa malaysia showed that the lee family of ioi group had acquired 6.3 million shares, equivalent to 1% equity interest, on the open market since march 25. this should help prop up the share price."}, "311": {"date_posted": "18/4/2016", "title": "malaysian derivatives market seen to grow by 5% to 8% in 2016", "article": " kuala lumpur (april 18): bursa

sector\nmaintain neutral: year to date (ytd), the kl finance index advanced 4.2% (2014: +1.7%) and outperformed the fbm klci by 120 basis points (bps) [2014: 70bps], led by alliance financial group bhd (afg) [ytd +10.3%], malayan banking bhd (maybank) [ytd +8.4%] and cimb group holdings bhd (cimb) [ytd +6.3%]. the strong recovery of afg and maybank is probably attributed to their attractive dividend yields going forward at 4.3% and 5.3%, respectively, (versus the industrys average yield of 3.8%). cimbs surprise performance is probably attributed to improved commodity prices and the stronger ringgit, which allayed fears of its exposure to commodity-related assets. only two of the nine stocks were below expectations (hong leong bank bhd [hlbank] and rhb capital bhd [rhbcap], while the rest met with our expectations. among the observations made during the quarter were: (i) lower earnings growth, (ii) improving liquidity position, (iii) the increasing pressure of net interest margins (nims), (iv) lower non-interest income, (v) improving asset quality, and (vi) lower credit costs. some expectations for financial years 2016 (fy16) and fy17 are: i) aggregate loan growth weakening to +8% for fy16 and +8.2% for fy17 (fy15: +9.9%), (ii) the nim sector contracting further by 9bps to 10bps (fy15: -7bps); (iii) non-interest income growth picking up some paces (+4.7%/+11.7% vs fy15: -1.6%); (iv) credit charge ratio for the sector increasing by 7bps for fy16 but weakening by 1bps the following year (fy15: 12bps) to 39bps-38bps; (v) cost-to-income ratio falling by 169bps-124bps (fy15: +165bps) to 49%-47.7%, and (vi) earnings to grow marginally by 0.1% in fy16 but surge strongly by 6.7% for fy17 in anticipation of improved metrics as mentioned above (vs fy15: -2.1%). for the past six years, the asset quality of the banking industry has been improving. as at feb 16, we observed that the industrys gross impaired loans (gil) ratio had fallen to a low of 1.64%. with the expected subdued domestic economy and banks restrictive in lending, we expect gil to remain stable at around 1.75% for fy16 (1.74% for fy15), and shedding 3bps to 1.72% for fy17. although the economy is expected to be slower in 2016, the appreciating ringgit and stronger commodity prices might boost confidence in the economy, prompting banks to lower their loan loss provisions and thus lower credit charge. we see maybank and rhbcap as likely beneficiaries from such revisions. with no let-up in the current structural and cyclical concerns such as: (i) slower loan growth, (ii) narrowing liquidity environment, (iii) compressing nim, (iv) weak capital market activities, as well as (v) rising credit costs, we continue to be neutral on the banking sector. hence, we advocate caution and adopt a selective stock picking strategy; rhbcap (target price [tp]: rm6.23) and maybank (tp: rm9.33) are the outperforms in our banking stocks universe. we like rhbcap for its cheap valuation at 0.8 times price-to-book-value (p/bv) versus the industry average of 1.5 times p/bv which is nearly reaching its lowest point in its 10-year history; hence, we believe the stock price has bottomed out. essentially, we like maybank for its extensive regional exposure in asean-5. both banks will also benefit from any downward revision of credit charge ratio.  kenanga research,

2016. payment solutions provider ghl systems bhd used to be the kind of company that investors thought best to avoid as it carried on without a clear direction and was mired in losses for years. the entry of simon loh, ghls controlling shareholder, and a boardroom shake-up  resulting in the appointment of raj lorenz as the groups ceo in 2011  put an end to the deterioration. on being credited for ghls reversal of fortune  turning a loss of rm26 million in the financial year ended dec 31, 2011 (fy2011), into a profit of rm4.37 million a year later  raj jokes, maybe i should give myself a pat on the back. the groups growth trajectory, however, is no laughing matter. in fy2015, its net profit grew to rm10.34 million, on the back of rm211.38 million in revenue. this represented a 60.7% and 28% improvement year on year in its bottom and top lines respectively. much of the growth was due to its transaction payment acquisition (tpa) division, which comprises two components  providing telecommunications companies (telcos) with prepaid top-up facility and bill collection services through electronic payment as well as directly contracting with merchants to accept payment services and provide card payment services. the companys two other divisions are shared services and solution services. now, riding the growth of electronic payments across asean, ghl and its investors have high expectations of the tpa business. ghls acquisition of australian-listed e-pay asia ltd  a pioneer electronic mobile prepaid provider in malaysia  in 2014 is showing signs of becoming earnings accretive. ghl paid rm69 million for the company, which also had loh as a major shareholder. the purchase was funded through a share swap (2.75 ghl shares for each e-pay share) and private placement of up to 20% of ghls enlarged issued and paid-up share capital at an issue price of 42 sen per ghl share. ghls fy2014 earnings increased significantly after the acquisition. its turnover jumped 158% y-o-y to rm164.93 million while net profit rose 23.3% to rm6.37 million. raj had expected e-pays contribution to plateau but he has been proved wrong. last year, e-pay contributed significantly to the tpa segments revenue growth of 32% to rm157.3 million. in particular, for the quarter ended dec 31, 2015 (4qfy2015), e-pay boasted a transaction value processed of rm886.4 million, 18.1% higher y-o-y. e-pay is growing faster than the market. when we bought the company in 2014, frankly, we didnt envisage that it would grow that strongly. fortunately, our calculations were proved wrong and e-pay is outperforming my expectations, raj tells the edge. based on the 4qfy2015 numbers, he says it is reasonable to expect the same rate of growth for e-pays transactions this year as more consumers switch to electronic payment. if you look at e-pays turnover, about 85% of its throughput comes from mobile top-ups while the rest comes from non-mobile services such as bill collection. the non-telecommunications segment is growing at a compound annual growth rate (cagr) of 45% and the telecoms segment is growing at a cagr of 16%. malaysias mobile subscription penetration rate is about 140%. that is about 40 million subscribers, out of which 80% are prepaid users. from that 80%, close to two-thirds are still using scratch cards for mobile top-ups. that is what electronic payment is replacing. since we are connected to every telco in the country, everyone can use electronic payment, he explains. another factor is the relatively new card payment services segment within the tpa business. last year, ghl tied up with cimb bank bhd to provide payment facilitator services. under the respective agreements, ghl is responsible for acquiring merchants on behalf of the bank. a similar arrangement has been made with global payments card processing malaysia sdn bhd, a partner of hsbc bank malaysia. raj says the card payment services engines are firing. each of these companies move in different channels. cimb was the first to kick off the physical card business with our electronic data capture (edc) terminal. it started rolling out in june last year and we have added a significant number of merchants in that short period of time and 2,500 points of sale. with global payments, we have moved on to the internet space, providing internet payment services. it is now ready for the physical space, he continues. the success of these partnerships is reflected in the groups 4qfy2015 results. during the quarter, the card payment services segment saw a rise in transaction value processed of 4.7% y-o-y to rm455.5 million. the tpa business should see an added boost as ghl will be working with another local bank in 2qfy2016. details on the new partnership are still scarce but it is understood that ghl will be able to target its desired audience of small merchants. in that vein, the group will be launching a mobile point-of-sale in a large way to acquire underserved merchants that cannot afford the conventional edc system. im after the really small guys  plumbers and the delivery guys. the tens of thousands that are not being served today u2026 the banks typically build their systems for larger merchants. we think there is no point going there because its already crowded, occupied by the banks. so, we went for the little guys and weve built for them, says raj. outside malaysia, ghl expects its tpa business to kick off in the philippines in 2qfy2016. earlier plans to do so with two market-leading telcos in the country were delayed due to upgrading changes in banks back-end systems to comply with a higher security standard. it is worth noting that the philippines is ghls second largest revenue contributor by geographical segment. in fy2015, it earned rm25.9 million in revenue from the country. revenue from the tpa segment in the country grew 30.9% y-o-y. raj says he expects ghl to maintain its earnings growth in fy2016. based on the potential of its tpa business in malaysia and the philippines, the group shows promise for growth. yet, not all are convinced. analysts are divided on what the companys growth potential is worth. bimb securities research has a sell call on the stock with a target price of 64 sen on the basis of its high valuation. in contrast, cimb investment bank research has an add rating with a target price of rm1.15. after a rally last year that saw the companys share price reach a record high of rm1.28, ghl has seen a rapid selldown. it closed at 89 sen last wednesday, giving it a market capitalisation

science (esbla), should also be finalised in the next few months. prestariang has been working on the esbla project since 2013 and it was supposed to have been finalised by the end of 2015. however,

however, the research house said a weaker 2hfy16 was expected for gamuda due to declining order book and weak property sales. the blended construction pretax margin of 6.9% in 1hfy16 still has room

fund awards 2016  five individual awards and one group award. the fund house won the highly prized best overall group award for the third time. it won the coveted award in 2008 and 2012. ken goh, acting chief investment officer for asean, attributes the win to its investment process, which allowed the company to identify fundamental changes early and deliver absolute returns that were consistently ahead of the market. we foster an environment that encourages team members to openly express non-consensus views. given our due respect for the market, alpha generating ideas come from views that arise outside of market consensus, he says. our investment approach is primarily based on bottom-up stock selection. we have worked very hard and managed to find the right stocks to remain fully invested over this period. the bottom-up focus also allows us to develop unique insights and thought leadership in our top-down analysis and macro views. goh also attributes the win to the companys excellent teamwork, which is built on passion, focus and trust. the team has been relentlessly focused on delivering consistent returns to investors, regardless of market conditions. its expertise and fund performance have stood the test of time. on the challenges the fund house has been facing, goh says global equity markets have been significantly more volatile since the federal reserve announced in 2013 that it would end its asset-buying programme. previous periods of lower volatility created elevated valuations and intensified worries of misallocation of capital into inefficient or non-performing assets. all these have caused markets to swing wildly, he adds. with the surge of the us dollar against all major currencies over the years  which we expect to level off for now  asia ex-japan unfortunately lagged in the past few years as capital flows shifted out in favour of developed markets. this elevated level of volatility really tested our longer-term convictions and fundamental view. in 2015, the fund houses regional funds were underweight commodities as oil prices continued to come under pressure due to oversupply. it also reduced its exposure to china in tandem with the devaluation stresses against the renminbi. in anticipation of further turmoil in china, our regional funds increased their cash holdings in august and favoured hard currency countries. our global funds continue to favour europe and japan because their central banks will continue to ease, goh says, noting that 2015 saw market volatility rise to global financial crisis levels. the fund house saw flat to negative returns from all asset classes in us dollar terms in 2015. it became very challenging to pick the right securities given the macro headwinds and elevated volatility. fortunately, given the weakness of the ringgit, our investors benefited from the strong returns of our global and regional equity funds last year, says goh. despite the global market gyrations last year, the fund house ended up with more than rm60 billion under management, compared with rm50 billion at the start of the year. goh believes 2016 is likely to continue to experience slow economic growth, low inflation and low interest rates. fund managers expect volatility to remain high and the us dollar strength to have peaked, as it appears that the fed was premature to hike the interest rate in december 2015. this should lead to less pressure against emerging market currencies and the renminbi. given the sluggish outlook, we expect flattish returns from local and global financial markets this year. we prefer international over local markets given the structural challenges and currency weakness that the malaysian economy faces, he says. goh adds that with the us manufacturing sector shrinking for the second straight month in december, concerns that the fed may have raised interest rates prematurely are surfacing. with the bank of japan and european central bank signalling intent for more drastic monetary stimulus, the fed is likely to put its rate hikes on hold. however, central banks in asia have the option of cutting interest rates to boost growth. goh says indonesia has cut rates without causing weakness to the rupiah. thailand, the philippines, singapore, india and south korea are expected to ease their monetary policies this year. chinas growth has weakened, but the growth forecast is relatively impressive at 6% to 7% for the year. as the governments reforms wend their way through the economy, we expect the peoples bank of china to address economic imbalances while aiming for a soft landing, and minimising collateral shocks, he adds. we expect volatile swings to be more frequent and extreme. given the uncertain market environment and heightened earnings risk, we stay risk-averse and careful in our investment decisions, says goh. the fund house is neutral on asian equities as they are likely to remain range-bound as long as the renminbi is not allowed to depreciate meaningfully (to its fair value range of 7.20 to 7.50). overall asian corporate earnings in 2016 have a bit more downside to go and our bottom-up analysis suggests zero growth versus consensus estimate of +3%. after the large correction in january, we are selective in the technology and financial sectors as they appear to have been overly punished, and continued portfolio outflows will remain a headwind during the year, goh says, adding that the fund house is avoiding commodities as it expects supply and demand imbalances to worsen in the coming years. fund managers will continue to be cautious on value and cyclical stocks as there is overcapacity and overleverage in many industries, he says. the portfolios will remain fully invested and defensively positioned. goh says the fund house expects another good year for its portfolios as it continues to improve and strengthen its investment process. we have positioned our portfolios defensively for the coming year, and diversified across sectors and countries. given all known global market issues still persisting from the previous year, any external shocks to the global markets where asset correlations would approach unity will have an adverse impact on our strategy. elevated market volatility has us focusing on low beta stocks that should provide modest returns  realistic returns of 5% to 10% per annum  in the long term. he says its funds will also focus on absolute returns in the long term as opposed to having a short time horizon to ride out market volatility. by doing so, we expect market fundamentals to prevail while we are proactive in minimising downside risks. losing less in the short term and gaining more in the long term is the investment guideline we pursue. we focus on companies that have cash flow certainty, such as airports, healthcare and utilities, and growth plays that are tailored to solid investment themes, for example, goods

earlier. in a filing with the exchange, poh kong said the sharp decline in its profit for the quarter was due to a decline in sales volume during the quarter, as demand for gold jewellery products

its crude palm oil (cpo) will not be affected even in the event of a suspension of the company's roundtable on sustainable palm oil (rspo) membership, as cpo is a globally traded commodity. ioi said the only effect that a rspo membership suspension would have is to deny the company certified sustainable palm oil (cspo) premium earnings on its oil, which represents less than 0.5% of its total

basket of major currencies, headed towards its first weekly gain in four weeks, it said. alliancedbs research in its evening edition wednesday said that led by the days high settlement at 1,724.75 in the preceding day, the fbm klci had on march 23 traded higher to 1,726.55 as some market participants continued to play on the buying side in anticipation of a higher market. however, it said non-follow through buying interest in the area of 1,726.55 prompted profit taking activity. the research house said this pushed the benchmark index down to 1,716.43 before settling off the days low at 1,724.55 (down 0.20 points or 0.01%) in the last few minutes buying of selective blue chip stocks. in the broader market, losers outnumbered gainers with 476 stocks ending lower and 361 stocks

intentional buying attempt to pull the market a step closer to the 1,730 level. however, the buying steam fizzled out in the area of 1,726. as the benchmark index was only 4 points away from the 1,730 resistance level, market participants with winning trades took advantage of higher market to lock in their stock gains. when buying demand began to dwindle in the face of stronger selling supply, market turned downward to register the first down close in the last 6 market days. while new buying attempt to lift the benchmark index higher in the subsequent day (march 24) cannot be ruled out, but the last few minutes buying of selective blue chip stocks was seen not convincing enough to sustain the market at a higher end, it said. the research house said following the down close on march 23, the market is likely to trade lower with immediate support seen at 1,715. it said that a fall below 1,715 could send the market down to the subsequent support at 1,700, adding that indicator wise, the

companys pharmacy business is based on a franchise model. investors keen to take up bioalphas pharmacy franchise (under the constant brand) would be able to either acquire an existing pharmacy from the company or open a new pharmacy at another location. bioalpha will manage these pharmacies and the company will receive management fees, based on a certain percentage of the profit. in addition, bioalpha gets top-shelf space at the pharmacies for its house products, which would be promoted by the staff. this strategy is paying off as sales of its house products at constant pharmacies have increased since the start of the year. bioalpha currently has 13 constant pharmacies under its umbrella, all in the klang valley. management shared that there are investors keen to open new constant pharmacies outside the klang valley. this is positive for bioalpha as it should help the company sell its house products outside the klang valley. bioalpha is also launching its e-commerce platform

now ripe for the picking", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on march 21, 2016.   kuala lumpur: after being overlooked for the past couple of years as crude oil prices stayed in the doldrums, plantation stocks seem to be gaining interest now as the commoditys price stages a recovery, the interest, ironically, is being driven by the scorching el nino heat, which is threatening crop yield. still, sunny days, in more ways than one, are ahead for plantation companies, according to kaf investment funds bhd chief investment officer gan kong yik. if you talk about plantation stocks, over the past few years, nobody have even bothered to look at them because the cpo (crude palm oil) price was trading at about rm1,900 per tonne. some of the stocks have been laggard compared to [stocks in] all the other sectors. but sentiments have changed and you can see there are increasingly more people talking about plantations. interest has been coming in very strongly, he told the edge financial daily. cpo prices declined sharply in the middle of 2014 due to larger-than-expected global vegetable oil supplies, weaker demand for biodiesel usage in indonesia, and low crude oil prices. on sept 2, 2014, cpo futures fell to rm1,914, the lowest since march 2009. the malaysian government stepped in to temporarily waive the export levy in may 2015, which helped to support cpo prices. after almost a year, it announced last week that the export levy on palm oil will be reinstated next month at a 5% rate. the export duty kicks in when cpo prices touch above rm2,250 per tonne at 4.5%, and can go up to 8.5% when prices exceed rm3,450 per tonne. for exposure to the sector, gan prefers palm oil companies with estates that boast trees with a young age profile, such as sarawak oil palms bhd and ijm plantations bhd, as well as those with cheap valuations like th plantations bhd, which is trading around its five-year low. we also favour sarawak oil palms and ijm plantations. they are all good picks because they have exposure in kalimantan, so their trees are all very young, which means the yields will be better than those companies with old trees, he added. data from the malaysian palm oil board show that production has been declining since november last year, and stockpiles have been slipping since december last year. inventories, comprising cpo and processed palm oil, stood at 2.17 million tonnes at the end of february, down 6.05% from a month earlier. this follows a 7.7% decline in cpo output last month to 1.04 million tonnes, compared with 1.13 million tonnes in january. as a result, cpo prices have rebounded to above rm2,500 per tonne. the third month futures contract for cpo closed rm29 higher at rm2,622 per tonne last friday, buoyed by prospects of a sharper decline in inventories expected in the months ahead. some, like midf research, think it could touch rm3,000 per tonne in the second quarter of 2016. its analyst alan lim expects the palm oil inventory level to decline to 2.02 million tonnes in march and fall to the critical level of around 1.5 million tonnes in the second quarter of 2016 as production declines further due to el nino. during the period of critical level of inventory, we expect [the] cpo discount against soybean oil to diminish and hence, our short-term cpo price target of rm3,000 per tonne in the second quarter of 2016, he said in a note issued last friday. midf researchs top pick is ioi corp bhd, due to its rerating potential after it regained its syariah status on nov 30, 2015, and strong year-on-year earnings growth of 22% to rm778 million in the first half of financial year 2016. public investment bank analyst chong hoe leong noted that concerns about palm oil supply could spike if stocks decline past the psychological level of two million tonnes. his full-year average cpo price estimate is rm2,500 per tonne. if inventory drops below two million tonnes, it could hit rm2,800 per tonne. besides young tree profiles and those with cheap valuations, investors should consider picking stocks with a pure upstream focus, he said. our top pick is ta ann holdings bhd, followed by tdm bhd, genting plantations bhd and tsh resources bhd. meanwhile, cimb investment bank bhd remains neutral on the sector despite its positive earnings potential, as this is offset by the risk of lower-than-expected production. the sector at this moment is positive in the sense that prices are rising. but the concern is that the rise in prices is coming due to a weaker supply situation. so, we are neutral on the sector. our preferred stock in malaysia is genting plantations bhd, she said. she likes genting due to its young estates, solid balance sheet and strong management. downstream players, such as singapore-listed mewah group and wilmar international ltd, would also reap benefits from the 5% export duty on cpo to kick in next month, she said, as they are likely to enjoy higher processing margins due to the difference between the higher export tax on cpo against refined palm products, which have zero export tax."}, "324": {"date_posted": "15/3/2016",

higher target price (tp) of rm5.55: findings from our latest round of channel checks paint a bullish outlook for the sectors award phase in the short to medium term. we conclude that the second line of mass rapid transit (mrt 2) awards are likely to be accelerated as at least three bids for major civil work packages are close to being finalised, including the international swiss challenge for mrt 2s underground scope. our channel checks also confirmed a recent article suggesting that the total cost of mrt 2 has risen to around rm30 billion against rm28 billion as per the 11th malaysia plan (11mp). new information also suggests that mrt awards could commence one or two months ahead of the initial timeline of may to june. what is more appealing is that the mmc-gamuda joint venture could be in the running to clinch an even larger underground package from mrt 2, worth up to rm15 billion (original value: rm10 billion to rm12 billion) given the official revised scope (up 40%). revival of the mrt story in the short term strengthens gamuda bhds tender prospects, which comprise several other sizeable jobs too. we calculate an estimated tender book of rm9 billion comprising mrt 2, pan borneo highway, light rail transit 3 and gemas-johor baru double track projects. this exceeds our rm5 billion assumed wins for financial year 2016 (fy16). securing a rm7.5 billion mrt package would raise our fy17 to fy18f (forecast) earnings per share (eps) by 2% to 3% and tp by less than 2%. a best-case rm9 billion win would bump up our eps by 6% to 7% and tp by up to 5%.  the potential revival of construction plays in months ahead and investors preference for big-cap infrastructure laggards could trigger a recovery in gamudas foreign shareholding, which stands at a low of 21%.the stock trades at a 9% discount to its 2015 high of rm5.13, which is unjustified given the improved visibility of its job replenishment prospects. gamuda remains our top pick among the big-caps given its biggest exposure to mrt 2 and the largest proxy to rail jobs. 2016 looks likely to be an eventful year, bringing its order book to a new all-time high of at least rm8 billion. the rm10 billion penang transport master plan should drive its longer-term prospects. we raise our tp (from rm5.43), based on a 10% discount to revised net asset value (rnav), as we update for the new warrant proceeds and new land bank (10% rnav discount). we reiterate add. uncertainties of the impact of the steep decline in oil prices on budget 2016s and 11mps development expenditure, and in turn, the implications to the planned government-led rail infrastructure projects were a big overhang on the share prices of major contractors since late 2015. however, concerns over major delays and risks of job cancellation were largely addressed when the revised budget 2016 in january 2016 reiterated the governments commitment to pump-prime and execute big-ticket projects including mrt 2 and pan borneo highway. we believe gamudas share price is a laggard and has not fully reflected the potential recovery in sector catalysts and the renewed outlook for job flows. the potential revival of construction plays and investors preference for big-cap infrastructure laggards could trigger a recovery in gamudas foreign shareholding, which stands at a low of 21%, in comparison to 45% to 50% when the group secured its first mrt underground package in 2012. current levels present a good opportunity to accumulate, in our view.  cimb investment bank, march 11"}, "325": {"date_posted": "15/3/2016", "title": "heatwave

above 17,175mw last wednesday. however, analysts doubt that more households switching on air-conditioners for longer hours would lift tenaga nasional bhds (tnb) sales revenue much, considering the current change of economic climate is not expected to augur well for manufacturing activities.  still, the stock is on most analysts recommendation list and fund managers see it as the more appealing one among fbm klci component stocks. electricity consumption growth is very much in tandem with the economic growth, said analysts. given the anticipated slower gross domestic product (gdp) growth to 4% to 4.5% this year  the slowest pace since 2008, hence they opined that the decline in manufacturing output is likely to affect the power demand this year. cimb investment bank bhd analyst xiao jun saw told the edge financial daily that for one, the peak demand, which showed the one-day consumption high, was just that of a single day and not an overall electricity consumption growth. furthermore, the new peak demand was just less than 2% higher from the previous peak, which was recorded in 2014. this also means that there was no growth in 2015 in terms of peak demand, he said. he said that for tnb to achieve a significant earnings upside, electricity consumption needs to continue growing stronger. but for electricity consumption from its bigger segments  being household and commercial  to grow higher at this juncture might seem unlikely, in this economic climate, he said. according to tnbs statement last friday, the biggest one-day demand for electricity in peninsular malaysia previously occurred on june 6, 2014, when 16,901mw was consumed. it breached the 17,000mw mark last wednesday, setting a new record. for the record, peak demand in the financial year ended aug 31, 2015 (fy15) clocked in at 16,822mw, occurring in april of that year. another analyst concurred that the current hot weather is just a temporary effect, noting that given the annual electricity consumption growth is usually in the range of 2% to 3%. to achieve better revenue and earnings growth, tnb needs to better manage its fuel cost and power plants to ensure higher efficiency. that said, analysts forecast double-digit growth in tnbs profit for fy16. according to bloomberg, the consensus forecast that the utility would achieve a net profit of rm6.87 billion, which is 12.3% higher against rm6.12 billion in fy15. earnings per share (eps) are expected to expand to rm1.18 in fy16 against rm1.08 the year before. for fy15, electricity sales grew by 2.11% to rm41.72 billion, with unit demand growth being 2.2%. phillip capital management sdn bhds ang kok heng said that while it is unlikely for electricity consumption as a whole to fall year-on-year, a softer economy could prompt industries to operate plants at shorter hours or close them down altogether for a period. nonetheless, he viewed tnbs valuation being still attractive compared with other blue chips on bursa malaysia. you can say that the power industry is recession-proof. and in malaysia, the sector is dominated by tnb. so essentially, any growth in demand will go to the group. based on consensus forecast eps of rm1.18, tnb shares are trading at a price-earnings ratio of 11.4 times on yesterdays closing of rm13.44. tnbs share price has staged rebound after it hit a low of rm10.40 in late

xiao jun. however, he is expecting the sector to recover in the second half of 2016 (2h16) as stronger economic growth should boost consumer confidence. although the near-term outlook for the property sector remains challenging, saw remains overweight on the property sector, as he believes that the sectors fundamentals are better than perceived. he noted that the supply of new houses had lagged behind demand over the past few years, suggesting that there should be strong pent-up demand for housing. in addition, developers have repositioned their offerings towards meeting demand for mass-market housing, in response to poor appetite for high-end properties. if investors are not confident about the sector recovery in 2h16, they can stick to property stocks that offer dividends such as lbs bina group bhd and uoa development bhd during the downturn, and get capital gains when the sector recovers in the long term, he told the edge financial daily. saw is of the view that lbs and uoa development are safer picks, as both companies offer dividends to investors, to be supported by unbilled sales. in a note to clients dated feb 3, saw was projecting that lbs will offer dividend yields of 7%-9% in the financial years ending dec 31, 2016 and 2017 (fy16 and fy17) (inclusive of a special dividend of six sen per share for fy16-17), the highest among all the property developers under his coverage. meanwhile, the dividend yield for uoa development is projected to be 6.83% for fy16. lbs recognised a revenue of rm680.4 million in fy15, a 1.8% increase year-on-year (y-o-y) from rm668.3 million, while earnings rose 8.7% y-o-y to rm76 million. however, its unbilled sales hit a record high of rm993 million as at dec 31, 2015. this, coupled with the expected strong sales in 2016, could lift its revenue to rm1 billion in 2017, based on saws estimates. for uoa development, saw cut fy16-17 forecast earnings per share (eps) by 4% to reflect a shift in sales mix in favour of smaller and lower-priced units in 1h16, and narrower profit margins due to more incentives offered to entice homebuyers.  his top pick is eco world development group bhd (ecoworld), as he believes that the company will be able to achieve its rm4 billion sales target for the financial year ending oct 31, 2016, underpinned by the launch of its rm8.7 billion bukit bintang convention centre and rm10 billion eco marina projects. while saw cut ecoworlds fy16 eps by 15% to reflect the challenging conditions in 1h16, he raised fy17-18 forecast eps by 0.3-8% as he expects 2h16 to be better. his other pick in the sector is eastern & oriental bhd. while appetite for high-end properties is likely to remain weak in 2016, saw is of the view that the stake sale in the first package of its seri tanjung pinang phase 2 could be a rererating catalyst for the stock, as it would crystallise the value of the land. in a note dated march 2, alliancedbs research head bernard ching expected slower property sales volumes in 2016, though prices should hold up due to cost-push factors. his picks in the sector are matrix concepts holdings bhd for its sustainable township development in seremban, and mkh bhd for its large exposure to affordable housing and landed properties in the kajang-semenyih growth corridor. maybank investment bank senior analyst wong wei sum in a note dated jan 13

issue. mbsb, which has terminated two merger talks within 13 months, yesterday announced to bursa malaysia its proposal to undertake a renounceable two-call rights issue to raise up to rm2 billion  an amount equivalent to almost half of its current market capitalisation of rm4.09 billion. the first call of the rights issue will be payable in cash and the second call shall be capitalised from mbsbs share premium and/or retained earnings account, according to the announcement to bursa. the issue price (comprising the first call and the second call) and the entitlement basis for the proposed rights issue have not been fixed at this juncture to provide flexibility to the board in respect of the pricing of the rights shares and the number of rights shares to be issued, said mbsb. epf is the single largest shareholder of mbsb with a 65.1% stake, followed by tycoon tan sri chua ma yu, who bought a 6.06% stake last week. meanwhile, permodalan nasional bhd owns 3.32% of mbsbs shares. in the announcement, mbsb said it had procured a written undertaking dated march 10 from the epf board, which has undertaken to subscribe in full for its entitlement under the proposed rights issue based on its shareholdings of 1.85 billion mbsb shares as at march 4. epfs undertaking is subject to first call being priced at a minimum discount of 25% to the theoretical ex-rights price (terp) based on the five-market-day volume weighted average price (vwap) of mbsb shares up to the market day preceding the announcement of the price-fixing. based on epfs shareholdings and the maximum gross proceeds, the undertaking will be up to rm1.3 billion [and] the remaining portion of rights shares for which no undertaking is obtained will be fully underwritten, said mbsb. it also noted that it is the boards intention the first call to be priced at a discount of at least 25% to the terp based on the five-market-day vwap of mbsb shares immediately preceding the price-fixing date. mbsbs share price has been on a decline since october 2014, falling from the peak of rm2.52 to a low of rm1.30 in august 2015. the stock closed at rm1.44 yesterday. mbsb, which is currently undertaking kitchen sinking exercise booking in massive provision for non-performing loans (npls), said the proposed rights issue is in line with its strategy to strengthen its core capital. the proposed rights issue will also enable mbsb to increase its leverage ratio to at least 12.5% in compliance with bank negara malaysias requirement, it added. mbsbs net profit shrank to rm257.59 million for the financial year ended dec 31, 2015 (fy15) from rm1.01 billion the previous year. the sharp fall in earnings was mainly dragged down by provision for npls that swelled to rm697.2 million, compared with rm126.2 million in fy14. mbsb has been in two merger talks since 2014. last month, mbsb and bank muamalat malaysia bhd aborted their plan for a merger to create the countrys largest stand-alone islamic bank. prior to that, mbsb was part of a failed mega bank merger with cimb group holdings bhd and rhb capital bhd, which was called off in january last year. based on mbsbs issued share capital of 2.84 billion as at feb 29, the

termination of a charter contract for its floating production storage and offloading (fpso) unit sparked heavy selling of bumi armada bhd shares, which dived 21% or 21 sen to a six-month low of 79 sen yesterday. termination of contract by its client, woodside petroleum ltd (woodside), is expected to deal a big blow to bumi armadas financials considering the demand for assets, like fpso, is weak in the current severe downturn in the oil and gas industry. bumi armada owes some us$198 million (rm805.82 million) to a consortium of banks for the financing of the fpso, according to sources familiar with the matter. bumi armada would be in a more difficult situation as it is much harder for the group to look for another fpso client under the current oil price scenario which provides similar return on assets as implied by t he original contract, said hong leong investment bank research. the edge weekly reported that the regions leading fpso operator is currently under pressure from the consortium of banks, including sumitomo mitsui banking corp and frances natixis, which has lent it money to finance the fpso, called armada claire. the unit has been operating at the balnaves oilfield, offshore of northern australia since first oil delivery in august 2014. while bumi armada seems to be looking to fight the termination, but with the compensation remaining unknown, most analysts are revising their target price on bumi armada shares. this turn of events was a negative surprise and is likely to weigh on sentiment for the stock. it could also raise concerns for other existing contracts. we downgrade from add to hold, said cimb research, which has downgraded the stock to hold from add. kenanga research has also downgraded to underperform from outperform on bumi armada with a lower target price of 80 sen, while jf apex has also downgraded the stock to sell with a target price of 90 sen. according to jf apex securities analyst, lee cherng wee, the notice of termination from woodside is an unexpected cancellation. when asked if the stock price is oversold, lee said it could be a knee-jerk reaction to the news. however, we are concerned on the possibility of more cancellations of its prized fpso contracts in view of the ailing oil and gas sector, he added. an analyst from public investment research agreed that the revision on the target price is an overreaction. like all oil negative or adverse oil news, it is definitely a knee-jerk reaction in terms of the magnitude of the news. we still need further details to fully assess the project, said the analyst. public investment research has previously questioned the potential contract extension of armada claire, after channel checks about depleting production coupled with lower oil price that could severely impact the commercial viability of the balnaves field. we had therefore assumed the non-extension of the option and also excluded the project from our fy16 (financial year ending dec 31, 2016) onwards valuation. our target price of 90 sen premised on our dcf (discounted cash flow) valuation is thus retained. it added."}, "330": {"date_posted": "3/3/2016", "title": "klci slips into

the drawing board for both malaysia building society bhd (mbsb) and bank muamalat malaysia bhd now that they have aborted their plan for a merger, proposed four months ago, to create the countrys largest standalone islamic bank. it was disagreements over valuation and control that led to the breakdown in negotiations. sources close to the talks say bank muamalats 70% shareholder, conglomerate drb-hicom bhd, had sought for the bank to be valued at between 1.4 and 1.5 times price-to-book value (pbv) in a share-swap deal, giving drb-hicom a stake of up to roughly 30% in the merged entity. however, mbsb, in crafting the merger proposal, was only willing to accord it a valuation of between 1 and 1.2 times pbv, which would have translated into a 22% to 26% shareholding for drb-hicom in the merged entity. it was initially expected that mbsbs 65% shareholder  the employees provident fund (epf)  would end up as the largest shareholder in the merged entity with a stake of about 40% while drb-hicom would hold a stake in the mid 20% range, and khazanah nasional bhd  bank muamalats other shareholder with a 30% stake  about 10%. but drb-hicom wanted a higher shareholding and at least equal control with, if not more than, the epf. the parties made a last-ditch attempt to reach a compromise on jan 28, a few days before the feb 2 deadline that the central bank had given them to hand in their submission. but it ended up that neither side was willing to budge and so, on feb 2, they called the merger off, a source tells the edge. mbsb is twice the size of bank muamalat in terms of assets. when contacted, mbsb president and ceo datuk ahmad zaini othman and bank muamalat ceo datuk mohd redza shah abdul wahid declined to comment on the failed merger. when asked about the groups next step, however, ahmad zaini says mbsb is unlikely to pursue any other merger and acquisition this year. at this stage, were not looking at another exercise. were just looking at further strengthening the company, so in the event we want to embark on a corporate exercise later on, were in a better position to do it. the edge had reported as early as two weeks ago that the merger had hit a snag and was likely to be called off. we are not surprised with the news [of the aborted merger] but we view it as a lost opportunity for mbsb to expand its assets and deposit base. based on earlier merger assumptions, the merged entity would have had total combined assets of rm63.5 billion and deposits from customers of about rm49 billion, midf research says in a research note on feb 3. analysts say the merger would have helped mbsb address its high funding cost issue by utilising bank muamalats wide network of 60 branches. more importantly, it would have allowed non-bank lender mbsb to become a full-fledged islamic bank that could tap the interbank money market for funds. mbsbs shares fell 2.7% to close at rm1.41 the day it announced the merger was off. analysts have a hold call on the stock, with a 12-month target price of rm1.69. bank muamalat is not listed. what now for the two lenders? for non-bank lender mbsb, which has been pursuing the m&a route to enable it to get on to a banking platform, it is its second failed merger in a year. it was only on jan 14 last year that a proposed mega bank merger among cimb group holdings bhd, rhb capital bhd and mbsb was called off, after six months of talks, in view of deteriorating economic conditions. given that, it makes sense for mbsb not to jump into any other merger opportunity so soon. merger talks take time and can be distracting for a banks management. analysts say it is likely that the group will embark on a capital-raising plan over the next few months. this was something it had been pursuing prior to getting caught up in the mega merger and, later, the islamic merger talks. in an interview with the edge a few months before getting into the mega merger talks, ahmad zaini had said the group was considering some form of capital raising, probably about rm3 billion with its major shareholder, to strengthen its prudential ratios and for expansion. he said it would most likely be a rights issue. mbsb is due to announce its fourth quarter results for fy2015 later this month. our team has already embarked on revised strategies in the fourth quarter of last year, taking cognisance of changes in the economy. we are also being more prudent in the sectors that we continue to lend and our impairment programme is running into its second year, he says in the press statement. as for drb-hicom, it will be interesting to see what it plans to do with bank muamalat, given the looming end-february deadline the central bank has given it to reduce its 70% stake in the lender to at least 40%. industry sources say they would not be surprised if the tan sri syed mokhtar albukhary-controlled conglomerate, which is keen to remain in the banking business, has a few more months leeway to comply, given that the bank muamalat-mbsb merger did not happen. i wouldnt be surprised if it may have another six months, one tells the edge. interestingly, there will be a change of guard at bank negara malaysia within that period, with governor tan sri dr zeti akhtar aziz expected to retire in april. but with banks having to boost capital levels ahead of tighter regulatory requirements ahead, industry sources wonder if syed mokhtar will be able to support capital injections into bank muamalat in future. his drb-hicom is currently struggling amid a weaker economy. previous attempts to sell down its stake to several financial institutions, namely affin holdings bhd, bank islam malaysia bhd and bahrain-based islamic lender al baraka, also failed. it is understood that this was because drb-hicom had wanted to maintain control of the bank and its price expectations were too high. drb-hicom had bought its 70% stake from another syed mokhtar-related company in a rm1.069 billion deal back in 2008. the last islamic banking transaction in the country, in december 2013, was done at a pbv of 1.8 times. this was when bimb holdings bhd bought the remaining 49% stake that it did not already own in bank islam. bank muamalat accounted for about 7% of drb-hicoms rm13.687 billion revenue for the financial year ended march 31, 2015. meanwhile, for khazanah, the failed merger is another missed opportunity for it to divest its stake in bank muamalat. the governments investment arm considers its 30% stake in the lender as a non-core holding and has been looking to let go of it at the right price for several years now."}, "334": {"date_posted": "24/2/2016", "title": "umw o&g shares fall 7% after reporting losses in 4q", "article": " kuala lumpur (feb 24): umw oil & gas corp bhd (umw-og) saw its share

shrinking business activities were largely to blame for the massive quarterly net loss. the loss for the quarter translated to an annual net loss of rm372.31 million for the financial year ended dec

profit of rm80.3 million in 4qfy14. the oilfield services also reported a pre-tax loss of rm8.4 million for the quarter, from a profit of rm3 million in the previous year. \"the low crude oil price

foreign-exchange (forex) loss of rm1 million. we believe this was a result of the strengthening of the ringgit from 4.40 against the us dollar at end-1qfy16 to 4.30 at end-2qfy16. excluding the forex loss impact, hovids net profit in 2qfy16 grew 87% y-o-y on the back of higher revenue. in the first half of fy16 (1hfy16), however, hovids earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) margin slipped to 17.3% from 17.8% last year despite the weaker ringgit. its profit margin in 2hfy16 may continue to be under pressure due to additional operational expenses related to its new production lines commissioned in late-2qfy16. also, the current ringgit/us dollar rate of 4.17 is 3% stronger than the average of 4.28 recorded in 2qfy16. a stronger ringgit is negative for hovids profit margin because more than half of its sales are derived from exports. higher operating expenses and the forex loss led us to cut our fy16 earnings per share (eps) by 4%. we keep fy17 to fy18 eps largely unchanged as we expect profit margins to recover on the back of higher utilisation of its two new production lines commissioned in 2qfy16. these two lines, which boosted hovids previous tablet and capsule production capacity by 30%, could be fully utilised within six to 12 months after commissioning, given that its order book has always exceeded its production capacity. barring a severe deterioration in the local and global economic conditions, we believe hovid could increase its sales volume as the growth in demand for generic drugs is driven more by demographic factors and less by economic performance. higher sales volume should lower its average production cost and raise its profit margin. although we expect hovids earnings to be better, we believe this has been priced in as the stock trades at 19 times calendar year 2017 price-earnings ratio (per), 30% higher than the fbm klcis per. its per is also the highest among all the listed

lumpur: the substantial 47% jump in hartalega holdings bhds net profit in the third quarter ended dec 31, 2015 (3qfy16) does not appear to have excited investors and fails to reverse the current downtrend of its share price. analysts concur that hartalegas earnings prospects are bright, but the stock isnt on their recommendation lists simply because most of the good news have been priced in after a steady climb in its share price in the past two years. some investment analysts have even slashed their earnings forecasts and target price, as the nitrile glove makers latest quarterly earnings figures did not spring much positive surprises. hartalegas share price has been on a decline since it hit a historical high of rm6.10 on jan 8. year to date, its share price has slid 15.3%. the stock climbed about 50% last year, against the backdrop of a strong us dollar and lower raw material prices that have been the good factors that worked wonder for the export-oriented glove maker. according to cimb research, hartalegas core net profit expanded by 35% to rm217.2 million for the nine months ended dec 31, 2015 (9mfy16). its total glove shipment volume expanded 23.4% year-on-year to 11.3 billion units, driven by robust demand for nitrile gloves, which grew 28.6%. we expect another strong earnings performance in 4qfy16, driven by higher shipment volumes from higher utilisation and full commissioning of ngc (next-generation integrated glove manufacturing complex) plants 1 and 2, said cimb research, which has a neutral call on the stock. kenanga research is among the few with an outperform call on hartalega, with a target price of rm6.40. its bullish view hinges on the additional capacity coming on stream later this year to sustain earnings growth and hartalegas dominant position in the nitrile glove market, which demand is rising. however, some analysts cautioned about a margin squeeze caused by competition and higher operational costs in 9mfy16. furthermore, they opine that the favourable impact of a stronger us dollar is largely factored in. hong leong investment bank research (hlib research) wrote in a research note that hartalegas net profit came in below its expectations, due to higher operational costs. it noticed that hartalegas earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation margin had narrowed because of lower average selling prices arising from lower nitrile material prices and competitive pricing. hlib research maintains a hold call on the nitrile glove maker, but it has cut its target price to rm5.32 from rm6.47. we tweaked our production cost assumption higher to reflect the higher operational costs. we note that the strong us dollar catalyst may diminish in the second half of 2016, as the ringgit is poised to maintain its strength given resilient economic fundamentals. we trim our ringgit assumption to rm3.80/us dollar in our fy17 (ending march 31, 2017) and fy18 forecasts, versus rm4.00/us dollar previously, hlib research said. jf apex, which has trimmed its target price to rm5.07 from rm5.33 previously, concurs that the 9mfy16 core net profit of rm191.5 million (after excluding unrealised foreign exchange gains/losses and fair value gains/losses of derivatives) was slightly below expectations. the research firm nudged down its earnings forecasts for fy16 and fy17 by 6.1% and 5% to 17 sen and 20 sen respectively to account for higher-than-expected operating costs. our target price is lower considering the downgrade in earnings forecasts and its pegged at 25 times fy17 earnings per share, which is close to its historical five-year mean price-earnings ratio (per). although the group could benefit from its production efficiency and ongoing expansion plans, we are projecting the groups earnings to take a breather, as impacted by higher operating costs, jf apex said. meanwhile, midf research pointed out that the key positives of hartalega include being more than 90% nitrile-concentrated, well positioned in developed markets such as the united states, increasing production efficiency and attaining a good product differentiation strategy. however, we believe the key positives are largely priced in, as evident by its lofty per valuation in comparison with peers. the stock is currently trading at a forward per of 26 times, which is very much above the industrys average per of 20 times,

malaysia weekly, on february 1 - 7, 2016.  its going to be a challenging year for asean banks, but from an investment standpoint, several regional analysts are betting that indonesian banks  or at least the big four  will outperform peers in malaysia, thailand and possibly singapore. we believe asean banks will likely continue to face slower loan growth and higher credit costs in 2016. however, attractive valuations, together with a favourable change in the direction of interest rates, could lead to a stronger share performance for the indonesia and singapore banks. we believe an interest rate cut in indonesia could signal a stronger growth trajectory and, together with improved infrastructure spending, could ignite investor interest in a banking sector that we think can still deliver some of the strongest growth and profitability in asia. our top pick is bank mandiri, jaj singh, nomura holdings incs head of research on asean banks, says in a jan 15 report. at the time of the report, indonesian banks were trading at a 20% discount to their five-year trading history. jaj has an overweight call on the indonesia and singapore banking sectors, and is neutral on malaysia and thailand. while a weaker economic environment is expected to slow down lending among asean banks this year, analysts see loan growth coming in relatively stronger in indonesia, at 13% to 15%, compared with under 10% in malaysia, singapore and thailand. and the indonesian sectors net interest margin (nim), the margin between lending and deposit rates, is still one of the highest in the world, despite it coming under pressure. the nim ratio stood at 5.32% as at august 2015. in a telephone interview with the edge, he points out that indonesia still has much growth potential as it is a relatively underbanked market compared with malaysia or thailand. uob kay hian research, meanwhile, has an overweight call on indonesias banking sector and counts it as one of three sectors  the other two being construction and consumer  that are likely to deliver more than 20% annual earnings growth in 2016 and 2017. the research house has a market weight call on thailand and malaysia. there are 118 banks in indonesia, but the big four  bank mandiri, bank central asia (bca), bank rakyat indonesia and bank negara indonesia (bni)  account for about 40% of the sectors total assets. nomura forecasts that the four will see a 24% increase in year-on-year earnings this year, compared with a decline of 3.8% in 2015. indonesian banks under its coverage were down by an average of 12% in 2015, underperforming the stock market by 0.3%, due to concerns about asset quality, growth and external vulnerabilities. indeed, asset quality concerns have weighed on banks not just in indonesia, but also increasingly in singapore and malaysia. based on the latest data provided by the indonesian central bank, the banking sectors gross non-performing loan (npl) ratio deteriorated to 2.8% as at august 2015 from 2.3% a year earlier. jaj is not overly concerned, saying the increase does not suggest a systemic risk. he says based on banks earnings for the first nine months of 2015, and guidance from managements, npls, while rising, dont look to be a serious threat to earnings. we havent seen a meltdown or anything like that. the increase in provisions or the increase in npls is ... part of the business cycle, he tells the edge. on whether asset quality concerns in indonesia are finally abating, jaj points out that the situation for the big four and the rest of the banks could be different. the big four have much stronger balance sheets, control about half of the sectors deposit franchise  putting them in a better liquidity position  and tend to have the first pick of the more blue-chip, stable customers. the likes of bca and bank mandiri have said they think their npl could probably peak by the middle of the year, but that doesnt necessarily hold true for everyone, he says. the mid-sized banks might take longer, possibly six months or nine months, to recover from npls, he adds. uob kay hians top banking picks are bank mandiri and bank pembangunan daerah jawa barat dan banten. in its jan 15 report, nomura points out that a fall in commodity prices had led to concerns that companies falling margins could easily lead to loan defaults. we believe the risk from commodities is real but one has to make a distinction between hard and soft commodities. for instance, coal is still witnessing a fall in both its prices and export volumes. therefore, a bank with exposure to this sector is vulnerable to higher credit costs. it notes that bank cimb niaga  a subsidiary of malaysias cimb group holdings bhd  is one such example, with close to 5% of its loans to the coal sector. the big four banks, on average, have only 2% of their loans linked to the coal sector. nomura has a neutral call on cimb group. our least preferred [malaysian bank] is cimb group because we think its indonesian exposure could continue to be a source of high provisioning, and its lower capital ratios could limit dividend payouts, says the report. while nomura sees the operating environment in indonesia in the first six months of 2016 to be similar to 2015, it expects potential interest rate cuts to excite bank stocks. uob kay hian, in a jan 18 report, says interest rate cuts is the game-changer for banks there. bank indonesia had cut the interest rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 7.25% on jan 14  its first cut since march 2015. nomura thinks there could be another 25bps cut within the first quarter as inflation remains low and the currency is relatively stable. historically, interest rate cuts have provided a strong stimulus for indonesian bank stocks. in 2005 and 2008, when interest rates were cut by 250bps within six months, bank stocks rallied by 34% and 131%, respectively. while we forecast only a 50bps interest rate cut in 2016, we believe that this, together with attractive valuations and infrastructure spending, could lead to a rerating of indonesian bank stocks, it says. commenting on other banking markets, nomura says singapore offers lacklustre loan growth  possibly just 5%  but potentially higher interest rates there could help deliver stronger earnings growth. it believes there is room for interest rates to move up on the back of higher us rates depreciating asian currencies. however, there are market concerns about asset quality that centre around the property market, the banks exposure to china and commodities. around 43% if singapore banks loan portfolio is exposed to the property market. as for thailand, it thinks the banking outlook will be clouded by moderate growth momentum and earnings pressure from continued high credit costs. asset quality may improve in the second half of the year. most thai banks indicate that the worst has passed, but it could still take at least three to six months for a full recovery. meanwhile, nomura says it is cautious on malaysian banks despite their strong balance sheets and attractive valuations. we think earnings in 2016 would be contained by a combination of lower loan growth, nim compression and high provisioning."}, "342": {"date_posted": "17/2/2016", "title": "market staging a technical rebound", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial

indicates that the momentum is still bullish. furthermore, the bollinger bands are starting to expand and the fbm klci is near the top band of the bollinger bands. in the past few days, we see some

1,690 points. a slew of bullish catalysts  firm ringgit, rising crude oil and palm oil prices  could push the index to break above the resistance level. the agreement of four top oil producers to

stocks into a downward spiral yesterday, wiping out rm5.52 billion in market value from bursa malaysia. the rates vary according to the sector they are employed in. for those working in the plantation sector, the levy rate was raised by 154% from rm590 to rm1,500 per worker starting monday. analysts estimate the higher levy will shave off 1% to 8% of plantation companies earnings in the financial year 2016 (fy16). sime darby bhd led decliners in plantation stocks, ending the day 50 sen or 6.2% lower at rm7.57, erasing rm3.16 billion in market value to rm47.9 billion from last fridays close. this was followed by kuala lumpur kepong bhd, which lost rm426 million of its market capitalisation yesterday from last fridays close. the stock shed 40 sen or 1.67% to close at rm23.50, with a market

higher levy cut plantation companies fy16 earnings by 1% to 8%. the potential earnings cut on fgv and hap seng plantations holdings bhd are higher due to their lower earnings base and higher earnings exposure to palm oil. publicinvest research analyst chong hoe leong expects an increase of 4% to 6% or about rm50 per tonne in their operating production cost for the majority of malaysian plantation players. however, chong is of the view that the higher operating cost could be easily absorbed by the local planters, who have about 80% of foreign labourers in the workforce, as he sees an increase of 20% in crude palm oil price this year. alliancedbs research plantation analyst marvin khor also expects the foreign workers levy hike to be fully absorbed by plantation firms. in the near term, firms with a higher proportion of their estates in malaysia would see bigger impacts. this hike also adds to the minimum wage hike, which is planned to commence on july 1 this year (11% to 15% increase per worker). in our estimation, the earnings impact to malaysian plantation counters under our coverage would range from 1.5% to 15.4% for fy16 to fy17, he added. the levy hike has raised the ire of 55 trade organisations and chambers of commerce, which deemed the move as short-sighted. the government has been urged to withdraw its decision immediately. they also called on the government to conduct comprehensive consultations with all stakeholders to discuss the matter. according to findings conducted by the associated chinese chambers of commerce and industry of malaysia (acccim), the additional cost per year to agriculture (including plantation) stands at rm578.75 million a year, while for plantations alone (involving 375,565 foreign workers) it is about rm338.12 million a year. for housing development, acccim estimates the cost of construction to increase by 2% to 3%. we are totally surprised and disappointed by the abruptness of this announcement, given that the government has been potraying that it is an inclusive and consultative goverment, acccim deputy secretary-general tan sri teoh chang kok told a joint press conference yesterday. the foreign worker levy is not part of the goverments revenue and should in fact be ploughed back to the respective industries, said teoh, who expressed concerns that the sudden hike will have adverse impact on the local economy. this is a bad time to raise foreign workers levy as the economic slowdown is already putting a strain on the operations of many businesses, he added. he said the worst case scenario is that the cost hike could lead to business failures and would ultimately be passed on to consumers and result in price increases. due to the economic slowdown, coupled with a weakening ringgit, teoh said malaysia is becoming less attractive for foreign workers to work in. a shortage of workers, whether local or foreign, will have a significant and adverse impact on the economy of the country, he added. it has to be recognised that the size of our economy needs some six million foreign workers. the key is to have an efficient and transparent system in place for the management of foreign workers, he said. the trade bodies are calling for the government to legalise the estimated three to six million illegal foreign workers in the country instead. on the basis of a similar levy of rm1,250 per worker for the four million illegal foreign workers, who are converted to legal workers, the levies collected would amount to rm5 billion, said teoh. deputy prime minister datuk seri dr ahmad zahid hamidi announced on sunday that the new levy rate system would boost the countrys income by an additional rm2.5 billion. under the existing economic circumstances, we would suggest that rm2.5 billion of the rm5 billion raised to be assigned to the goverment and the balance to be reserved for the industries, said teoh. the trade bodies are also calling upon the government to improve the foreign worker management system and elimination of illegal and undocumented foreign workers. currently, the application process to recruit foreign workers is so expensive, convoluted, uncertain and [the] enforcement is poor. the process must be undertaken by [the] home ministry and not any outsourced parties, he said. teoh pointed out that no employer would prefer to engage undocumented foreign workers if the cost and process to engage legal foreign workers are reasonably priced, efficient and transparent."}, "346": {"date_posted": "2/2/2016", "title": "plantation counters largest

the potential earnings cut on fgvh and hap seng plantations bhd is higher due to their lower earnings base and higher earnings exposure to palm oil. \"employers may need to bear the cost of higher levy. we gathered that the plantation companies have historically absorbed the costs of the foreign workers' levy,\" she said. \"it is still early to tell if the plantation industry intends to absorb or pass on the additional costs to the workers. \"we believe the malaysian planters may absorb most of the costs initially, in view of shortages of estates workers in malaysia,\" she added. cimb

year cheer for top glove shareholders", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on january 4 - january 10, 2016.  shareholders of top glove corp bhd have plenty of reasons to celebrate this new year. the worlds biggest glove manufacturer has delivered yet another record profit and its share price has risen 200% since the beginning of 2015, making it the top performer among its peers. since dec 31, 2014, top gloves (fundamental: 2.70; valuation: 1.10) share price has tripled to rm13.58, giving it a market capitalisation of rm8.47 billion. with that, the company has overtaken kossan rubber industries bhd and become the second largest locally listed glove maker in terms of market capitalisation. during the same period, kossans (fundamental: 2.10; valuation: 1.10) share price more than doubled to rm9.30, giving it a market capitalisation of rm5.95 billion (see table 1). hartalega holdings bhd (fundamental: 2.30; valuation: 0.50) and supermax corp bhd (fundamental: 1; valuation: 0.50) also saw their share prices increase 69% and 93%, giving them a market capitalisation of rm9.75 billion and rm2.17 billion respectively. it is worth noting that top glove is currently trading near its consensus target price of rm13.73. in other words, the counter may see a potential upside of only 1%. opinions are divided over whether top gloves share price rally still has legs. analysts tracking the company are expecting more updates from its founding chairman tan sri dr lim wee chai and its managing director lee kim meow at a post-1qfy2016 results briefing on jan 6. for its first quarter ended nov 30, 2015 (1qfy2016), top gloves profit before tax came in at an all-time quarterly high of rm161.3 million, up 173% year on year. net profit rose 163% to rm128.9 million, representing 46% of the full-year net profit achieved in fy2015. sales volume for 1qfy2016 hit a record high, rising 15% y-o-y and pushing its quarterly revenue to a new high of rm800.3 million (up 41% y-o-y). in fy2015, top glove posted a net profit of rm280 million on revenue of rm2.51 billion. according to bloomberg, 14 research houses have a buy call on top glove and five have a hold recommendation. two others have a sell call. it has not gone unnoticed that the counter has risen above some target prices but has yet to test the higher levels, including macquaries target price of rm16.70, ta securities rm15.80 and alliancedbs researchs rm14.20. with such high target prices, it means that the stock still has an upside potential of 5% to 23% (see table 2). when contacted, rhb research analyst wong cheng horng acknowledges that the valuations of glove makers are getting higher. but this, he says, has become a new normal, considering the export-based industry is the prime beneficiary of the current exchange rates. if we look at top gloves year-to-date performance, it may appear scary. but bear in mind that the stock had been a laggard in the past, wong tells the edge over the phone. generally, he says, the glove sector remains attractive in terms of its earnings proposition, as 90% of the manufacturers revenue is us dollar-denominated. he adds that he does not foresee a correction in the sectors valuation as the ringgit, which has a close relationship with crude oil prices, is likely to remain weak. at the moment, rhb research maintains a buy call on top glove with a target price of rm13.82. wong says he may revisit the rating after the results briefing. in a dec 15 report, maybank ib research says top gloves valuation is undemanding, considering that it is now the sectors new bellwether and yet cheaper than its big-cap peers, namely hartalega and kossan. besides, its one-for-one bonus issue, which is slated for completion in mid-january, could provide an additional impetus to the share price, it says. the research house has a buy call on top glove with a target price of rm16.60. in another report on the same day, cimb research says the key potential rerating catalysts for top glove include sustainable margin expansion as shown in its latest results and improving liquidity from the upcoming bonus issue. it maintains an add rating on the stock with a higher target price of rm16. in a separate note, hlib research says it is raising its target price for top glove from rm10.98 to rm16.38, based on an unchanged price-earnings ratio (per) of 19.9 times, which is above its three-year historical average per. the research house opines that the higher per is justifiable given that the company will benefit from a stronger us dollar, lower raw material prices and improved production efficiency. meanwhile, alliancedbs research says top glove is best positioned among its peers to capture currency gains as it is most exposed to the natural rubber glove segment, where competition is less intense due to modest incoming supply. the research house maintains a buy call on the counter with a higher target price of rm14.20. however, not everyone is optimistic about top gloves outlook. for instance, jp morgan securities is neutral on the counter, giving it a target price of rm9.30. the research house says the key downside risks are a reversal in ringgit weakness, pricing pressure in the nitrile segment and negative volume growth in the latex segment. midf research has revised its target price to rm13.01, but maintained its neutral call on the stock. although top glove has been benefiting from the rising us dollar, our economist expects end-2016 to see a lower rate, at rm3.90 per us dollar. as such, we are anticipating a more tapered growth in the next financial year, it says.  note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on

the weak ringgit in 2015 has brought cheer to many export-based industries that sell their products in foreign currencies such as the us dollar. unfortunately, the same cannot be said for oil palm plantation companies, although their chief produce, crude palm oil (cpo), is pegged to the greenback. the languishing cpo price, which has remained soft since 2012, did not put plantation companies in a position to benefit from the strong us dollar. one reason is that edible oil prices have declined more than the appreciation of the us dollar. while the low cpo price has been the reality for quite some time, fund managers and analysts are keeping a close eye on fertiliser costs, which show signs of creeping up, and foreign-currency denominated loans of some planters. these two could be the wildcards that become a drag on their earnings going forward, assuming edible oil prices do not pick up anytime soon. the issue of us dollar borrowings is not something people are worrying about yet, but some funds are watching it closely. the major concern is the growing liability and if that will eventually affect cash flows, cimb research regional head of plantations ivy ng tells the edge. ng adds that analysts and fund managers are not yet acting at this point, as it will depend on the ability of companies to refinance and pay off their debts. theoretically, raising debt in foreign currency should be a natural hedge for companies that earn foreign notes, simply because this would minimise their exposure to foreign exchange risks. even if the ringgit weakens, like the current scenario, companies would not be affected much as their earnings are in us dollars. for plantation firms with foreign currency loans, it is the case that they earn less due to low cpo prices and margin squeeze, hence, it may affect their ability to repay borrowings. among the plantation counters listed on bursa malaysia, ioi corp bhd and tsh resources bhd are the two that have relatively high foreign borrowings. borrowing in us dollars serves as a natural hedge and we think it will balance itself out, tsh group managing director datuk tan aik sim tells the edge, adding that in any case, foreign exchange losses remain unrealised at the moment. our borrowings are due in five to seven years time and who knows where the ringgit will be in that time, says tan. he adds that fertiliser costs have risen some 5% to 10% over the year, largely due to the 23% depreciation of the ringgit against the greenback. this impact could have been worse if the cost of fertiliser in us dollars had not been on the decline this year. fertiliser costs, which are quoted in us dollars, are a key cost component to planters, accounting for more than a third of the total cost. so far this year, the price of potash has reportedly fallen 12% in southeast asia to about us$293 per tonne. urea has plunged 25% to about us$240 per tonne this month. on fertilisers, i feel that the weakness in demand will continue to put downward pressure on prices, as will cheaper feedstock for urea. average november world prices [for the weighted average of urea, muriate of potash and triple superphosphate] were only 10% or so off their recent peak, dr james fry, chairman of global agribusiness consultancy lmc international ltd, tells the edge. malaysian plantation companies are in a position where many of their inputs, most notably fertilisers, are tied to the us dollar, which has pushed up their ringgit price, but wages are determined in ringgit, though there is upward pressure on wages from the imminent rise in minimum wages and as a result of competition with indonesia for good plantation workers, he says. for ioi corp (fundamental: 0.35; valuation: 0.30), more than 80% of its borrowings are in us dollars, while almost all of tshs (fundamental: 0.20; valuation: 0.30) borrowings are in us dollars. according to the latest financial statements for the first quarter ended sept 30, 2015 (1qfy2016), ioi corp has rm6.4 billion borrowings denominated in us dollars out of its total borrowings of rm7.7 billion. taking into account rm514.4 million in cash, ioi corps net debt stood at rm7.15 billion. analysts point out that in ioi corps case, the ballooning gearing levels could be a concern but are not at an alarming level. as at end-september, the groups debt-to-equity multiple was 1.64 times compared with 1.29 a year ago. in september, moodys investors service downgraded ioi corps outlook to negative mainly because of the downside risk of the cpo price. the change in outlook reflects moodys expectation of continued pressure on palm oil prices over the coming year owing to the ample supply of both palm oil and other vegetable oils, moodys says in a sept 4 press release. upward rating pressure is limited given the negative outlook and ioi corps modest revenue base and current cpo prices, but the outlook could stabilise if ioi corp is able to reverse its upward trend in leverage such that adjusted debt-to-(earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) returned to below 3 times to 3.5 times, it says. according to the latest data from bloomberg, ioi corps latest debt-to-ebitda stands at 4.12 times as at end-july 2015. that said, ioi corp is unlikely to be cash-strapped. moodys believes that the company has excellent liquidity, having improved its debt maturity by refinancing its long-term debt. as at end-september, ioi corp had short-term debt of only rm802.8 million and long-term debt of rm6.89 billion. in contrast, short-term borrowings were rm2.6 billion exactly a year ago, while long-term debt came to rm5.1 billion. one analyst points out that for now, ioi corp is only seeing a paper loss, in the form of foreign exchange losses, caused by the exchange rate fluctuation. however, tsh, which has 90% of its landbank in indonesia, needs to take up us dollar borrowings to fund new planting expansion, and this will have a negative impact. it sells cpo in rupiah, which is not better than ringgit, says the analyst. as at end-september, tshs us dollar borrowings stood at rm563.1 million against rm563.3 million in total borrowings, excluding loans. according to its earnings announcement for 3qfy2015 ended september, total borrowings came to rm1.36 billion. taking into account its rm50.2 million in cash, net debt stood at rm1.3 billion. tshs net debt-to-equity multiple has risen to 0.98 times as at end-september from 0.9 times exactly a year ago. note: the edge researchs fundamental score

check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that five research houses cover this stock. there is one buy call but four neutral calls on puncak. maybank ib does not cover this stock fundamentally.  according to bloomberg, its price-to-book ratio currently stands at a low 0.25 times. there is no current price-earnings ratio due to the negative trailing 12 months earnings per share at -0.03. the return on equity was recorded at 11.8%. for the past four years, the companys sales revenue decreased gradually, while the net income has been stable. there is no significant recent news on puncak. puncaks chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly down. its share price has made an obvious plunge since its major weekly wave-5 high of rm2.37 in june 2014. since that rm2.37 high, puncak fell to its recent january 2016 low of rm1.34. as prices broke above their recent key critical support levels of rm1.48 and rm1.75, look to sell puncak on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term downtrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, oscillator and macd) have issued clear sell signals and now show firm and obvious indications of puncaks eventual plunge towards lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm1.37, rm1.48 and rm1.75. we expect puncak to witness weak buying activities at its support levels of rm1.17, rm1.21 and rm1.34. its downside targets are located at rm1.00, rm1.06 and rm1.32.  lee cheng hooi is the

this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on december 28, 2015 - january 3, 2016.   daibochi plastic and packaging industry bhd is the largest plastic flexible packaging (pfp) producer in the country, but the melaka-based company cannot rest on its laurels. its closest rival, johor-based tomypak holdings bhd, has set an ambitious three-year target to overtake daibochi and become the largest locally listed pfp manufacturer in terms of market capitalisation. daibochi executive director geoff low jin wei, however, downplays the pressure of having to protect its top position in the market. unlike tomypak, daibochi does not seem to have an aggressive target for its market capitalisation  or at least, it has not been made public yet. daibochis strategy is to grow our core business through enlarging our multinational corporation (mnc) customer base and increasing our overall sales volume. our efforts thus far have rewarded our loyal shareholders  our market cap has grown more than tenfold in the last seven years, low tells the edge in an email. he says the companys focus is on sustainable growth, which can be achieved by establishing a more regional client base, developing new production innovations and continuously improving its internal processes. low, 32, was appointed to the board of daibochi in october 2010. the australian is the son of low chan tian, who is executive director and a substantial shareholder of the company. based on the closing price of rm5.18 last tuesday, daibochi (fundamental: 1.70; valuation: 1.10) is valued at rm589.8 million. year to date, the counter has risen 22%. by comparison, tomypak (fundamental: 1.70; valuation: 1.70), which has seen its share price more than double ytd, has a market capitalisation of rm289 million. meanwhile, smaller rivals advanced packaging technology (m) bhd (fundamental: 2.05; valuation: 2) and malaysia packaging industry bhd (fundamental: 0.35; valuation: 0.90) have a market capitalisation of rm42.1 million and rm18.1 million respectively. daibochi provides its clients in asean with packaging solutions. its customers are mainly from the food and beverage, fast-moving consumer goods, pharmaceutical and industrial sectors. the company has two manufacturing plants  in ayer keroh and jasin. its ayer keroh plant had an annual production capacity of 25,000 tonnes and a utilisation rate of 80% as at end-2013. its jasin plant, which commenced operations in the second quarter of last year, houses an extension of its film-making and metallising operations. according to low, the plant in jasin provides daibochi with much-needed capacity to target new growth opportunities. the vision of the jasin plant was to maintain an overall utilisation rate of about 70% to 75%. this would allow the company to aggressively grow its top line while managing the surges in its order cycle, he says. to date, some rm30 million has been spent on the jasin plant, mainly for land acquisitions, factory construction and new machinery. daibochis revenue has grown steadily from rm278.8 million in the financial year ended dec 31, 2012 (fy2012), to rm344.5 million in fy2014. its net profit, however, was lower at rm23.7 million in fy2014 compared with rm24.6 million in fy2012 and rm27.5 million in fy2013. the company has a dividend policy of distributing at least 60% of its net profit to shareholders and the dividends are payable on a quarterly basis. in the nine months ended sept 30 (9mfy2015), daibochis top line and profit continued to increase to rm261.84 million and rm20.13 million respectively, owing to the higher export sales volume as well as stronger us dollar. nevertheless, its 9mfy2015 results fell short of analysts expectations, making up only 65% of consensus full-year forecast. low says daibochi has been consistent in informing its shareholders, through bursa malaysia announcements, that the company is on track to achieve record turnover with stronger profitability in fy2015. the recent shortfall in [performance compared with] analysts forecasts was due to slower domestic sales on the back of longer-than-anticipated dampened consumer sentiment post-gst (goods and services tax) implementation. it is important to note that we did not lose any customers or product lines during this period, he stresses. low acknowledges that the impact of gst on consumer spending was more protracted than expected, which led to temporarily lower domestic orders as some customers sought to manage their inventory cycle efficiently. but outside malaysia, daibochi is still seeing healthy orders and good progress in several tenders for new export orders, especially from australia, new zealand, thailand and the philippines. overall, we are positive about our prospects for the next three years. based on the encouraging feedback from our customers, we aim to achieve double-digit top-line growth next year, says low. he adds that in australia, daibochis new product  sterilisable packaging for the pet food segment  is gaining traction. the company plans to ride its australian customer growth over the next three years and establish the country as a major manufacturing hub for the region. according to low, daibochi began supplying pfp products to a major mnc in thailand in 2013, which increased its exports and provided it with greater visibility as a regional supplier. the mnc continues to expand its production capacity in thailand and across the region. in the philippines, daibochi expects to commence the supply of a few new product lines. these late-stage tenders are expected to come onstream in the near term, together with a healthy line-up of other new tender invites, says low. it is worth noting that the stronger us dollar and low oil price environment have generally been favourable to export-oriented plastic companies such as daibochi. about 70% of its cost of goods sold are films and resins, while some 30% of its revenue is denominated in us dollars. more importantly, the current foreign exchange scenario allows us to price our tender bids more competitively compared with other players in the region, as we strive to aggressively build our export portfolio, says low. according to bloomberg, analysts from rhb research, uob kay hian and cimb research had a sell call on daibochi while only midf research had a neutral call as at august. the consensus target price is rm4.20, meaning that there could be a downside of more than 19%. on nov 23, daibochi proposed a share split and bonus issue, which was approved by bursa on dec 15. the company will split its shares from one existing share of rm1 apiece to two shares of 50 sen each. subsequently, there will be a bonus issue of up to 45.54 million new split shares on the basis of one bonus share for every five split shares.  note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical

in the edge financial daily, on january 14, 2016.   kuala lumpur: khazanah nasional bhd, the countrys sovereign wealth fund, is bracing for another volatile year following disappointing data in 2015, which saw its net worth adjusted (nwa) of its investment portfolio  a measure of value created  fall 1.6% to rm109 billion from rm110.7 billion the previous year. describing 2015 as a roller coaster year, khazanah managing director tan sri azman mokhtar said the falling value of the ringgit, which was among the worlds worst-performing currencies last year, was partly to be blamed for the lower nwa. the funds realisable asset value (rav), however, rose 3.2% to rm150.2 billion last year from rm145.5 billion in 2014. malaysia accounted for 55.1% of khazanahs rav by geographic exposure; while sector-wise, media and communications stood at 22%, followed by healthcare (17.2%), power (15.3%), financial institution groups (13.7%) and property (10.6%). our [2015 nwa] performance might be slightly worse than the fbm klci [which dropped by 1% last year], but we fared better than most of the reference regional markets, azman told reporters at the 12th khazanah annual review yesterday. in its presentation, khazanah compared its investment portfolio against the fbm klci, the straits times index (-11.4%), the jakarta composite index (-10.5%), the hang seng index (-4%), sensex (-3.7%), the philippines index (-2%), the istanbul index (-14.1%), the msci emerging markets (-14.9%), the msci asia ex-japan (-9.2%) and the msci ac world (-0.3%). the sole index seeing growth in khazanahs reference regional index was the shanghai index, which rose by 11.2% in 2015. the weak ringgit did have some effect on our foreign liabilities. yes, we have us dollar-denominated assets like our shares in alibaba group holding ltd, which would have strengthened the asset value. on a net-net basis, the weak ringgit did have some effect on our investments, although not by much, azman said. towards this end, he said khazanah has capped its foreign liabilities to 30% of its investment portfolio, when at one point, it was more than 50%. looking at its major investments, only the healthcare sector, particularly ihh healthcare bhd, made a positive contribution to its nwa with a rm6.5 billion increase in 2015. other sectors saw declines. khazanahs investments in cimb group holdings bhd saw the biggest decline of rm2.3 billion, and its stake in the telecommunications sector, specifically telekom malaysia bhd and axiata group bhd, declined rm900 million in net worth. its foreign holdings in alibaba, meanwhile, also declined by rm100 million. khazanahs rav cover  the ratio of its rav to liabilities  came to 3.1 times in 2015, down from the previous years 3.7 times. khazanahs profit before tax also fell by 63.4% for the financial year ended dec 31, 2015 (fy15) to rm1.18 billion, from rm3.22 billion in fy14. this is the first time since the global financial crisis that khazanahs annual profit fell, excluding fy12 because of plus expressways bhds privatisation that occurred in fy11. despite weaker profitability, khazanah increased its dividend payout to the government by 16.7% to rm1.05 billion in fy15, from rm900 million the previous year. we might not be a listed company, but we want to have a dividend payout that is in line with major listed companies, where ideally you increase the payout gradually. and when there are years that you get a windfall, you declare special dividends, said azman. its not good to have a yo-yo pattern of dividends. the payout should have a steady progression. azman said while khazanah expects this year will be another bumpy one, the higher dividend payout and lack of profit growth last year would not affect its funds, should it decide to make new investments this year. by other metrics, like our asset cover ratio, cash flow, liquidity, we have enough to take advantage of the market this year when there are opportunities, he said. but this doesnt mean that khazanah wouldnt be careful with its investments this year, azman said. in times of turbulence, we need to look at the quality of our balance sheet and our rav cover, a critical ratio that we have always looked at, [which] indicates that we are coming from a position of relative strength.  the issue is more on the fact that in volatile and uncertain times, there is the risk of being too early or too late [in making investments], and trying to time the entry is not easy, he added. looking at the first week of trading in 2016, where the world markets fell when chinese stock markets were shut down twice after plummeting by 7%, he expects to see volatility continuing this year. we dont get funds coming in every month. its not like a pension fund where there are new deposits coming in. we have to be careful with our investments, azman said. in 2015, khazanah made 23 investments totalling rm8.7 billion and 10 divestments worth rm5.3 billion, with gains of rm2.9 billion. to date, the fund has made a total of 144 investments worth rm74.7 billion, as well as 77 divestments with overall gains of rm22.3 billion. meanwhile, azman said khazanah had injected rm1 billion into valuecap sdn bhd, following prime minister datuk seri najib razaks directive last year to the equity investment firm to help prop up the stock market. khazanah is one of the three shareholders of valuecap, besides kumpulan wang persaraan (diperbadankan) and permodalan nasional bhd."}, "365": {"date_posted": "14/1/2016", "title": "klci to trend cautiously, support seen at

stocks tumbled on wednesday to their lowest close since september and oil prices gave up an early rally on mounting worries about the global economy, according to reuters. major u.s. stock indexes finished down more than 2 percent, with the nasdaq off more than 3 percent. the s&p 500 ended a two-day rebound, closing below 1,900 for the first time since september, it said. alliancedbs research in its evening edition wednesday said despite the up close in the preceding day, the fbm klci had on jan 13 traded within previous days range to form an inside day bar as market participants chose not to play an aggressive selling game. it said in the absence of stronger selling interest, the benchmark index was in the green throughout the trading sessions before settling at 1,642.54 (up 1.17 points or 0.07%). in the broader market, gainers outnumbered losers with 459 stocks ending higher and 371 stocks finishing lower. that gave a market breadth of 1.23 indicating the bulls were in control, it said. alliancedbs research said another day of inside day bar was witnessed on jan 12. this implied that market participants were still unwilling to play an aggressive game. the benchmark index may be presently seen at a level where buying demand and selling supply forces are at equilibrium point. however, sellers were believed to be looking for an opportunity to sell again with buyers on the other hand waiting for a meaningful consolidation before making a buying decision, it said. the research house said given such a market scenario, the market is likely to confine its trading activity between 1,637 and 1,657 for the time being. it said a fall below 1,637 would put pressure on the market down to the subsequent support zone, 1,620 u2013 1,627. however, it said a rise above 1,657 should see a market reversal to the upside, adding that indicator wise, the macd was below the 9-day moving average line. the analysis of overall market action on jan 13 revealed that buying power was stronger than selling pressure. as such, the fbm klci would likely trade above the 1,646.48 level on jan 14, said alliancedbs research. based on corporate announcements and news flow

japans nikkei 225 index fell 6.3% in a week to 17,218.96 points. the bearish sentiment was also extended to us and europe markets. the us dow jones industrial average declined 4.4% in a week to

tracking declining crude oil and soybean oil prices. the fbm klci failed to recover after breaking below the short-term 30-day moving average last week. the fbm klci is also below the ichimoku cloud indicator and this indicates a bearish market. the trend is expected to remain bearish as long as it stays below the resistance levels from these indicators at 1,680 points. the momentum indicators suggest a further decline for the fbm klci. the declining rsi and macd indicators indicate a strong bearish momentum. furthermore, the index has fallen below the middle band of the bollinger bands and the bands are starting to expand. this indicates that the bearish momentum is gaining strength. however, there will be an indication of support if the index can stay above the immediate resistance level at 1,620 points. last week, i mentioned that if the index breaks and stays below 1,650 points, it may test the next support level at 1,620 points. the stronger bearish momentum in the past one week suggests the index moving to this level this week. weak fundamentals, especially the weaker ringgit and falling commodity prices, could cause market sentiment to remain bearish. a breakout below 1,620 points could lead to a more significant decline, like what happened in the second quarter of last year. benny lee is chief market strategist for jupiter securities sdn bhd. jupiter securities is

moratorium starting this friday on bauxite mining activities in pahang that was announced by the state and federal governments will not have any negative impact on its business operations. based on the sourcing and off-take agreement dated june 2, 2015 entered into between asdion's wholly-owned subsidiary venice sanctuary sdn bhd (vssb) and hong kong international mining exchange ltd (hkim),

approval date overlapped with the commencement of the monsoon season as commonly occurs throughout malaysia (in particular the east coast of malaysia). this in turn affected the quality of bauxite

non-payment of dividends at hw. hw is heveaboard's largest shareholder with a 27% stake. hw was not in a position to pay dividends from 2009 to 2012 as heveaboard's financials were stretched following the collapse in the particleboard industry, and the high court had decided in favour of the defendant in the suit. heveaboard's management also said the allegations that its containers held up by

recovery in rapid awards; other infra jobs in the rail, highways, and port/marine segments; margin expansion for its infra division; stronger earnings for its us dollar-driven cambodian airport concessions, and recovery in foreign shareholdings which currently stand at just 10%. the stock trades at a still-attractive price-earnings ratio (per) of 8-9 times financial year 2016-17 (fy16-17), which is at a 28% to 35% discount to the average construction sector per of 13-15 times, unjustified in our view. our tp (30% revalued net asset valuation discount) implies target pers of 12.8 times for fy16, and 11.5 times for fy17.  cimb research, jan 8"}, "376": {"date_posted": "7/1/2016", "title": "best deals of the year: best share placement: size and timing the positives in tnb exercise", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on december 21 - 27, 2015.   the rm1.6 billion placement by cimb investment bank bhd and credit suisse of khazanah nasional bhds shares in tenaga nasional bhd at rm14.50 apiece gets the nod for the best placement exercise this year. the placement does have its merits, among them the sheer size of the offering. at rm1.6 billion, it was the fourth largest in the history of the local capital markets. also as at dec 10 this year, tnb  with a market capitalisation of rm75.4 billion  was the largest company on bursa malaysia and the largest utility company in southeast asia, which added to the appeal of the whole deal. the block of 112 million shares was the third that khazanah had disposed of in a span of two years. it is noteworthy that since the last placement in june 2013, tnbs shares have gained circa 77%, auguring well for khazanah. with the sale, the state-controlled investment arm has pared down its shareholding in tnb to 30.4% from 32.4%. adding to the positives for khazanah is the timing at which the placement was executed. the placement was launched four days after tnb released its first-quarter financials for the year ended august 2015. due to the sterling results  the utility giant registered a net profit of rm2.35 billion on the back of rm11.03 billion in revenue, a gain of 34.29% and 15.25% respectively from the previous corresponding period  its shares traded at rm14.77 apiece despite fears of a weakening ringgit and amid rumours of an electricity tariff reduction, which weighed down the stock. in the run-up to the results, the counter gained rm1.27 or close to 9.5%, maximising khazanahs gain from the placement.  khazanahs block in tnb saw strong momentum on the back of positive prelaunch indications, resulting in a narrow price range of rm14.40 to rm14.60, or a discount of 1.35% to 2.7% on the launch date closing price of rm14.80. cimb ib managed to bring in a mix of quality domestic institutional investors, international long-only investors and hedge funds from asia and europe to take up the placement. a large portion of the shares  circa 86% of the block  was allocated to high-quality domestic and long-only funds, and about 84% of the book was allocated to the top 10 investors. the placement, priced at rm14.50, was a 2% discount on the launch date closing price of rm14.80, representing the tightest discount ever achieved for a malaysian block trade larger than us$400 million. the allocation strategy employed by cimb ib resulted in a steady and stable aftermarket performance, with trading volumes in line with historical averages, and investors who participated in the placement buying in the aftermarket as well. tnb closed at rm14.56 the day after the placement. during the day, it hit an intraday high of rm14.70 and low rm14.52, on volume of 11.6 million shares. since the conclusion of the block trade, the stock has closed at a high of rm14.88, which is a 2.6% premium over the placement price.

latest financial sector statistics from bank negara malaysia (bnm) may see investors maintaining a pessimistic view of the banking industry but not all are shying away from investing in them. malayan banking bhd (maybank) and rhb capital bhd (rhbcap) have emerged as the top picks due to their attractive valuations and earnings growth prospects. the central bank data showed malaysian banks loan portfolio growing by 8.4% year-on-year (y-o-y) in november, the third straight month of slowing growth (october: 9.1%; september: 8.4%). novembers loan application declined by 5.4%, while the approval rate fell at a bigger clip of 11%. in fact, the sector has been in the doldrums over the last few years, notably since the responsible lending guidelines and tighter mortgage lending criteria were implemented. non-performing loans have been inching higher while deposit-taking activities slowed. in dealing with net interest margin compression, banks have undertaken various measures to cut cost, including letting staff go. nevertheless, some fund managers and analysts have turned positive on maybank and rhbcap. with valuecap [sdn bhd] eventually entering the market, it would be enough to support the stocks deemed to be undervalued, areca capital sdn bhd chief executive officer danny wong teck meng told the edge financial daily. armed with rm20 billion, valuecap has been mandated by the government to invest in undervalued malaysian stocks to lend confidence to the local market. it was supposed to begin investing the first tranche of funds worth rm6 billion by the end of november 2015, but funding issues with one of its three shareholders had delayed the plan. wong, who manages about rm700 million of assets, said he favours maybank due to its dividend yield. midf research senior analyst kelvin ong echoed this view in a note on monday, saying maybanks yield is attractive and that malaysias largest bank by asset size has diversified earnings  giving it the only buy call among all banks under midfs coverage. bloomberg data showed 13 out of 23 analysts have buy recommendations on maybank. with an average target price of rm9.07  derived from a range of rm5.50 to rm11.20  it implied an 8.88% upside to yesterdays closing. analysts have projected total dividend per share (dps) of 64 sen from maybank for its financial year ending dec 31, 2016 (fy16), unchanged from fy15. with that, the stock would yield 7.68% from yesterdays price. dps for rhbcap is estimated at 22.19 sen a share, giving it a yield of 3.96%. but analysts and fund managers are optimistic on the banks growth prospects, with the proposition becoming sweeter because rhbcap is trading at 29.6% below its book value. cimb investment bank (ib) is one of the eight research outfits recommending investors to accumulate rhbcap and said last october that the bank is worth investing in for up to five years. cimb ib has a target price of rm8.50 for rhbcap, the highest among the 19 analysts tracking the bank. bloomberg data showed rhbcap has an average target price of rm6.24. despite the disappointing third quarter of fy15 ended sept 30, 2015 results, rhbcap remains an add and our top pick of the sector as we envisage stronger earnings per share (eps) growth in fy16, said cimb senior analyst winson ng in a nov 30, 2015 note. he projected rhbcaps core eps to grow by 22% y-o-y to 72 sen in fy16, from 59 sen. he said catalysts for the stock would be benefits rhbcap reaps from implementing its three-year transformation programme ignite 2017, costs saved from downsizing headcount via its career transformation programme, and the drive for regional expansion in the longer term. maybank added 13 sen or 1.59% to close at rm8.33 yesterday, while rhbcap gained three sen or 0.54% to close at rm5.60. but merely investing in banks trading below their respective historical book values would not be a good idea, eastspring investments bhd general manager of investment services yvonne tan told the edge financial daily. instead, she said she would look at whether a bank has been generating returns on equity (roe) that are in line with their historical averages. if they dont, eventually their book values will deteriorate anyway, she added. usually, we would value banks with low roes at a discount to their book values, and a premium when they have high roes. apart from rhbcap, three other stocks are trading below their current book values. they are cimb group holdings bhd (at a 5.56% discount to its latest reported book value per share), ammb holdings bhd (10.61%) and affin holdings bhd (44.71%). but in general, tan said she does not favour the sector for now. these are premised on four reasons: business environment is very challenging, demand in the property market is still soft, continued softening of consumer sentiment, and rising credit costs. kenanga investment bank in a note on banks on monday put the forward roe for malaysian banks at 12.8%, with all aforementioned banks being below the average. those with roes above 12.8% are public bank bhd, hong leong bank bhd and bimb holdings bhd. affin, meanwhile, has the lowest, at 7%, and the only one with a single-digit return. of course, with softer economic conditions and tighter lending criteria by bnm, banks are no longer enjoying roes like in the early 2010s. but bloomberg data showed rhbcap and cimbs average estimated roe in their financial years ending dec 31, 2016 (fy16) to grow by at least 41 basis points. there will be headwinds in the short term. but we project earnings growth for some of these banks by the end of the year. when prices are weak, thats the time to accumulate stocks, said areca capitals wong. but he said cimb still carried a risk as it has regional presence. with economic conditions softening in the region, investors might not be too favourable towards cimb."}, "382": {"date_posted": "4/1/2016", "title": "news: prs funds delivered mixed performance in 2015", "article": " this

in the local and global economy. these include heightened volatility in the market, the ringgit being the worst-performing currency in the region and slower growth globally. over a one-year period (until nov 30), core funds under the conventional growth category registered returns of -2.25% to 8.94% while shariah-compliant growth funds registered returns of 3.81% to 5.84%. conventional and shariah-compliant core funds under the moderate category provided one-year returns of -1.53% to 4.35%, and 2.28% to 4.37% respectively. core funds under the conservative category registered one-year returns of 1.13% to 5.19% for conventional funds and 1.60% to 2.88% for shariah-compliant funds. comparatively, all core funds registered lower returns over a one-year period compared with last year. conventional non-core funds performed relatively better than their core fund counterparts, with one-year returns of -3.64% to 8.86%, while shariah-compliant non-core funds one-year returns ranged from -4.75% to 13.33%. two new non-core funds were launched at end-2014, namely amprs-asia pacific reits d and kenanga oneprs shariah equity fund. the new funds provided respective year-to-date returns (as at nov 30) of 10.59% and 7.40%. for funds asset allocation, core funds follow the parameters set by the securities commission malaysia (sc), while non-core funds determine their own level of risk. non-core funds can invest directly in any local or foreign investment instrument or collective investment scheme that is approved by the sc. according to independent investment research firm morningstar, amprs-conservative d outperformed its peers in the conventional conservative fund category, returning 5.19% over a one-year period (ended nov 30). according to the funds mandate, as at oct 30, 80.73% of its net asset value (nav) was invested in collective investment schemes including amconservative (37.92%), amcash management (20.21%), amincome extra (11.47%) and amincome reward (11.13%). the rest was invested in various sectors, and only 2.93% was held in cash and others. within its shariah category, public mutual prs islamic conservative fund returned 2.88% over the same period. public mutual bhd ceo yeoh kim hong says the companys conventional funds continue to experience challenging market conditions as banking and financial stocks have underperformed the broad market. she attributes the higher returns of its prs islamic funds (as compared to the conventional funds on a one-year return basis) to the outperformance of the fbm emas shariah index. shariah-compliant stocks performed better this year with the fbm emas shariah index trading unchanged compared with a decline of 4.17% in 2014. as at sept 30, public mutual prs islamic conservative fund had invested 59.9% of its nav in sukuk, 17.1% in shariah-compliant equities and islamic derivatives, and the rest in the islamic money market. the aia pam-moderate fund came out tops in the conventional moderate category, providing returns of 4.35% over a one-year period. as at april, 21.75% of its nav was invested in investment funds  namely dbxt msci asia ex japan 10 etf and investec gsf asian equity a  while 3.24% was held in cash and the rest in various sectors, including trading/services, finance and construction. comparatively, cimb islamic prs plus moderate a returned 4.37% in the shariah category. the kenanga oneprs growth fund was the best performer in the conventional growth fund category, returning 8.94% over this period. as at july, 69.1% of the funds nav was invested in kenanga growth fund, 28.9% in kenanga bond fund and 2% held in cash. the kenanga growth fund invests in malaysian equities, mainly in the trading/services sector (22.4%), short-term deposit and cash (22.0%) and industrial product (15.1%). the kenanga bond fund invests mainly in malaysias unsecured corporate bonds (58.7%) and short-term deposit and cash (27.6%). kenanga investorsbhd executive director and ceo ismitz matthew de alwis attributes the funds performance to the outperformance of the underlying equity funds. all kenanga oneprs funds outperformed their respective targets. this is mainly due to stock selection as the overall market remained in the red compared with last year. our strategy of overweighting the export and manufacturing sector together while underweighting underperforming sectors such as oil and gas and property also contributed to the outperformance, he explains. kenangas strategies remain focused on stock picking, while adopting a defensive strategy during times of market stress. although the general market was down, sectors such as manufacturing, exports and selected construction companies outperformed. we scrutinised companies that still exhibited strong earnings growth, for example companies that benefited from the weaker ringgit and recovery in us demand, de alwis says. nevertheless, he admits that volatility is an unescapable part of equity investing and the funds were impacted by the china-led selldown in august, though by a smaller extent. however, we remained with our bottom-up strategy of adding to selected stocks on weakness and subsequently recovered the lost performance. de alwis says the key challenges of managing the funds in 2015 were heightened volatility as the market digested numerous issues such as the implementation of the goods and services tax, government contingent debt (1mdb) and domestic political uncertainty. externally, the slowing growth in china coupled with the possibility of a us interest rate hike also weighed on sentiment. against this backdrop, foreign funds exited malaysias equity market to the tune of rm18 billion while the ringgit was the worst performer in the region, declining about 18% against the us dollar as at end-november. in the shariah growth category, public mutual prs islamic growth fund returned 5.84%. across all categories, the best fund (based on returns) over a one-year period ended nov 30 was cimb islamic prs plus asia pacific ex japan equity class a. the fund provided a one-year return of 13.33%. cimb islamic prs plus asia pacific ex japan equity class a is a non-core shariah-compliant fund. according to its mandate, as at october, 95.18% of its nav was invested in a target fund  the cimb islamic asia pacific equity fund  while the rest was held in cash. the target fund invests in asia excluding japan, with 91.47% in foreign shariah-compliant equities. it mainly invests in telecommunications (28.50%) and consumer (24.55%) sectors. the remaining 8.53% is held in cash. munirah khairuddin, ceo of cimb-principal asset management bhd, attributes the outperformance of the fund to the process-driven portfolios that aim to deliver consistent total returns, regardless of the market condition. our research effort is focused on looking for quality companies with growth, low-risk balance sheet and good operating cash flows. going forward, we intend to buy selective names on any significant correction. she says most of the companys prs funds are on track to exceed their targets. we took the opportunity to diversify our funds more into the regional markets [where permissible] that benefited from the weakening ringgit to add value. our prs funds with regional market exposure have provided better returns relative to the ones limited to malaysian asset holdings, she adds. non-core funds have regional exposure as compared to the more malaysian-centric core funds. the ringgit has depreciated against all asian currencies year to date, adding favourable forex exchange gains to our malaysia-denominated regional funds. over the past year, most of cimbs shariah-compliant prs funds have provided better returns  on a one-year and year-to-date return basis  than their conventional counterparts. munirah says this is due to the limited exposure of shariah-compliant funds in the financial sector, for example they cannot hold bank stocks. she also stresses that prs funds are meant for long-term investments. our investors are encouraged to stay invested and to avoid market timing. history has proved that equity markets tend to rebound and recover over time, rewarding those who remain invested. although there are prs funds that provide spectacular returns, 23 out of 46 prs funds have provided one-year returns of less than 2.5%, which is the dividend payout guaranteed by the employees provident fund. moreover, five of the 23 underperforming prs funds provided negative returns (see prs table on page 8). the public mutual prs growth fund registered one-year returns of -2.25%, which is the lowest among its peer funds, despite having the largest fund size (rm175,168,184 as at oct 30). yeoh explains that this was due to its more prudent approach to stock selection and the funds mandate of having a lower exposure to the foreign market compared with selected peer funds. on the overall funds performance, she says although prs funds have limited exposure to the chinese markets, their performance was impacted as the fbm klci eased amid the decline in chinas markets during the period. but as our prs funds did not have a significant exposure to the oil and gas sector, they were not directly impacted by the downturn in oil prices over the past year. other than comparing the absolute level of fund returns over a given period of time, investors should also look at the volatility of fund returns relative to other peer funds, yeoh suggests. since the commencement of the prs, our prs funds have registered less volatility or more consistent returns compared with peer funds. the contributors to prs schemes should always take a longer-term view when assessing their returns for retirement purposes, she advises. it is not appropriate to measure fund performance over short-term periods as the positioning of funds can fluctuate depending on the period under review. there were 46 approved prs funds as at end-november  33 core funds and 13 non-core funds  offered by eight providers, namely affin hwang asset management bhd, aia pension and asset management sdn bhd, amfunds management bhd (formerly known as aminvestment services bhd), cimb-principal asset management bhd, kenanga investors bhd, manulife asset management services bhd, public mutual bhd and rhb asset management sdn bhd. according to data provided by the private pension administrator (ppa), the central administrator of the prs, the industrys total asset under management (aum) exceeded the rm1 billion mark as at nov 30, up 68% from rm500 million a year ago. the prs member base has also risen almost 34% to 167,958, ppa ceo datuk steve ong says, compared with 111,258 last year. half of the new members that came on board are young contributors [aged 20 to 30]. it shows that they are not only concerned about wealth management but also preparing for their retirement capitals. investors need to know why they are investing. they can have a higher risk appetite when investing for wealth management, explains ong. but when it comes to retirement capitals, they cannot afford to take high risk as it would directly impact their retirement quality. this is where prs as a retirement product comes in. he remarks that potential and existing investors should not worry about poor short-term returns or the current market performance and thus refrain from investing in prs. a difficult 2016 in an environment of global economic stagnation with low growth and low inflation, fund managers will take on a cautious approach in their fund strategy to achieve the targeted returns. cimb-principal asset management bhd ceo munirah khairuddin says the company expects moderate returns for equities and fixed income in 2016. with the government forecast economic growth of between 4% and 5% in 2016, which will be driven mainly by domestic demand, we will maintain our equity allocation and remain cautious. we will stay focused on stocks with quality growth, strong cash flows and sustainable dividends, she adds. public mutual bhd ceo yeoh kim hong says exports and foreign direct investments are the potential bright spots for malaysia, but domestic consumption will be weighed down by increased cost of living due to subsidy rationalisation and higher imported inflation. as foreign investors are generally underweight in the domestic market following significant fund outflows from malaysia since 2014, any upside to the ringgit and oil prices may attract fund inflows into malaysian equities and help revive the market. although the earnings momentum of the overall market may be lacklustre, selected companies are poised to enjoy good earnings growth due to new projects or market share gains. these are the stocks that our portfolios will focus on, she adds. kenanga investorsbhd executive director and ceo ismitz matthew de alwis says, barring any major equity sell-offs, the company expects to see a similarly good performance for its funds in 2016, riding on the returns of the underlying funds. the prs funds will remain invested in the selection of underlying funds with a proven track record of returns to achieve the targeted returns.

(this signified) the lower risk of default in the corporate loan segment, he added. despite the slowdown in china's economic growth impacting malaysia's economic growth and banking sector, we believe that this has been factored into our projected gdp growth of 4.6% to 4.7% in 2015 and 2016, said zafrul. this however, does not mean a rosy picture ahead. zafrul expects the operating conditions in malaysia to continue to be tough in the first half of 2016, as consumer spending is hampered by the continuing weakness in ringgit, higher cost of living, rising unemployment and tighter credit.  nonetheless, fixed investment is expected to pick up as the new 5-year plan kicks off and it would help to offset some of the lost momentum in consumer spending, to ensure sustained strength in domestic demand, he said. on its part, cimb, the countrys second-largest bank, is projecting its net profit to grow by 11.2% for the financial year ending dec 31, 2016 (fy16)  on the back of our forecast of a 6.9% rise in net interest income and a 9.5% increase in non-interest income. for illustrative purposes, cimbs net profit for 9mfy15 fell by 30.37% to rm2.02 billion, from rm2.91 billion a year ago. bloomberg data showed analysts forecasting cimbs full fy15 net profit to be rm3.27 billion, against fy14s rm3.11 billion. moving on to corporate deals, zafrul said in 2016, investment deals could be supported by private sector outlays in the manufacturing and services sectors, as well as public infrastructure-related spending. we are optimistic on the malaysian bond markets in 2016. the year will potentially surpass 2015 in terms of sukuk sales, as we are projecting rm70 billion to rm75 billion of corporate bonds issuances for fy2016, out of which sukuk historically makes up about 70-80% of the annual issuances, he noted. he also sees several infrastructure projects comprising roads and railways, valued at the least between rm75 billion and rm80 billion that were deferred in 2015, to likely be launched in 2016, as the government attempts to sustain economic growth. due to the us federal reserve rate hike, we expect renewed interest in ipos and raising of capital in malaysia, particularly for export-oriented companies that would benefit from a stronger us dollar, he said of the ipo market. we also expect more activities on the merger and acquisition front, particularly in the insurance, electronics, property and telco industries, as companies look to consolidate or strengthen their market positions, said zafrul. cimbs counter shed three sen or 0.66% to close at rm4.54 today, bringing it to a market value of rm38.97 billion.

the effects have not worn off. earnings could be flat even in 4q2015. in fact, earnings growth has been flat for the last few quarters. but people are anticipating earnings to pick up next year. uninspiring earnings growth was a common thread running through the 27 component stocks in which the epf has a stake. many of the stocks recorded low single-digit growth in revenue in 3q2015 while more than half saw a contraction in net profit. umw holdings bhd was the worst hit as its net profit for 3q2015 shrank 93% from a year ago to rm13.5 million, although revenue barely moved, dipping 4.5%. the conglomerate says it was affected by higher operating cost and provisions for impairment. its cumulative net profit for the first nine months of the year also took a beating, falling more than half to rm247.1 million from rm574.5 million, while dividends for the period tumbled to 10 sen from 25 sen previously. clearly, it has not been a good year for umw holdings, which suffered a double whammy of a downturn in the oil and gas industry and softening automotive sales. rhb capital also saw a big drop in net profit  down 64.3% y-o-y to rm194.4 million  while revenue grew just 3.14% to rm1.97 billion. the banking group was affected mainly by one-off career transition scheme expenses amounting to rm308.8 million in 3q2015. it also saw a reduction in investment banking-related fee income, lower trading income and higher operating expenses. such lacklustre earnings growth impacted the dividend paid out by the 27 blue chips. in absolute terms, the companies distributed total dividends of 384.64 sen per share in the first three quarters of 2014 while for the same period this year, the dividends declined to 345.45 sen per share. the dividends declared, particularly by umw holdings, ammb holdings bhd, kuala lumpur kepong bhd and maxis bhd, declined 20% or more for the cumulative nine months of 2015 compared with the previous year. lower dividend payments naturally translate into less income for the epf. in terms of share price performance, many of these stocks were worse off than at the start of the year. ammb holdings and umw holdings stood out, having lost 25.84% and 23.31% respectively ytd. this should shed some light on the fbm klcis performance over the year, which has been flat ytd as its constituents unimpressive share prices dragged it down. there were some exceptions, like petronas dagangan bhd, whose ytd share price gained 49% in sharp contrast to its 43.4% fall last year.  ihh healthcare bhd was another star performer among the component stocks. the stock has jumped 34.11% since the start of the year, having gained 24.15% last year. while the situation seems bleak, areca capital ceo danny wong believes corporate earnings could be near the bottom of the down cycle for the component stocks. he is generally positive about earnings growth among the index stocks next year, but does not expect a spurt. wong comments that the major constituents of the benchmark index are the banking sector and plantations. broadly, the first half of 2016 could continue to be challenging for the banking sector, which has been up against slower loan growth, tighter net margins and a reduction in deposits, he says, adding that he sees the situation normalising in the second half of the year. as for the plantation sector, if crude palm oil prices rebound, things will depend on how the planters manage their cost that will determine their earnings going forward.

country next year, as consumer sentiment stays weak due to the protracted slump of the ringgit and rising cost of living in the country, which in turn could slow discretionary spending for non-essential purchases. this, in turn, may drag down genting malaysia bhds (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 0.8) domestic leisure and hospitality operations, and ticket sales for number forecast

4.2858 against the us dollar, compared with around 3.4955 a year ago, may still work to the gaming sectors advantage. we expect the weak ringgit to attract more foreign tourist visitations and encourage more local travelling among malaysians, which could benefit genting malaysia, said cheah. meanwhile, in a dec 4 strategy note, affin hwang capital said genting bhd (fundamental: 1.95; valuation: 1.4), which operates its premier resorts world brand properties in malaysia, singapore, the philippines, the united states and the bahamas, could see a potential turnaround should consumer sentiment and commodity prices recover. we see potential signs of bottoming out for its subsidiary genting singapore plc, which is still seeing sequential growth in the mass market and is largely mitigating the underperformance at the vip [players] segment. we note that there are persistently high bad debts at the vip market, but management expects these provisions to taper off in 1h16 (first half of 2016), said affin hwang. according to an analyst from maybank kim eng, another potential boost to the malaysian gaming sector would be the relaxation on visa policies for tourists from mainland china, which is expected to begin during the 2016 chinese new year in february. the easing on visa entry requirements for china tourists will be one of the catalysts for the gaming sector in 2016. however, the economic slowdown may affect the type of assets that are put up for collateral by the high rollers, said the analyst. some industry observers are also expecting the genting group to see a boost from its 20th century fox theme park, scheduled for opening in late 2016, which is part of its 10-year genting integrated tourism plan (gitp). in an oct 13 note, cimb research wrote that the gitp will entail more gaming capacity, a 10,000-seat arena, a central retail complex, a new cable-car system, parking for 3,000 cars and a six-star hotel. however, the research firm also noted that based on its discussion with the management of genting malaysia, the weak ringgit has caused the company to delay the opening of the theme park to 2017 from its initial scheduled opening. as for the nfos, the presence of the illegal gambling circuit in the country remains a persistent cause for concern, according to cimb research in its nov 22 note on magnum bhd (fundamental: 1.7; valuation:

analyst who declined to be named believes that the slowdown in the domestic economy may well turn out to benefit nfos. it all comes down to the hope factor. when people buy lottery tickets, they do so with the hope that their economic woes would disappear, and this plays out well for the nfos. for nfos in general, the luck factor remains the deciding factor as the prize payout ratio is inconsistent

non-compliance with certain regulations by its subsidiaries ambank (m) bhd and ambank islamic bhd. the penalty pertains to action pursuant to section 234 of the financial services act (fsa) 2013 and section 245 of the islamic fsa 2013, it said. both sections 234 and 245 are in relation to administrative actions that the central bank can take in the event a breach is committed under the respective acts. upon being pressed by bursa for details of the non-compliance, ambank group said: bank negaras action for the non-compliance came about because of weaknesses in our reporting systems and processes in place at the time, as well as inadequate skills on the part of some of our staff. the non-compliance did not result in financial losses either to ambank group, save for the penalty, or to its customers. bank negara has not placed any restrictions on the business operations of ambank group, it said in a filing last friday night. on being asked by bursa about the remedial actions it has taken, ambank group said it has strengthened its organisational structure in the area of compliance in order to improve its systems and processes. to strengthen the compliance function, ambank group has recruited a number of senior and experienced officers. for all of its staff, ambank group has increased and enhanced training and awareness programmes and, at the same time, senior management and the respective boards have heightened the oversight and improved the check and balance processes, it said. industry observers say the two statements by the group on the matter raise even more questions than provide answers on what happened. apart from the lack of transparency on what actually transpired to warrant the bank negara fine, there is also the matter of who should take responsibility for it. rumours are rife that a few individuals within the banking group have been told to go on leave. in its monday filing, ambank group also said it agreed with bank negara to a four-year programme of work towards achieving market best practices. it will set aside an average of rm25 million a year for four years for investments in systems, infrastructure and training to achieve this. its good the group is taking steps to improve its systems and processes, but that doesnt answer what actually happened and im sure stakeholders are wondering whats going on, says a senior banker. both bank negara and ambank group declined to comment for this article. banking sources say the breaches may be related to the anti-money laundering act and exchange control act, and that the penalty amount suggests there were multiple breaches. incidentally, last monday  the day of the groups revelation about the penalty  was datuk sulaiman mohd tahirs first day on the job as group ceo of ammb and ceo of ambank. sulaiman was formerly the head of cimb bank bhd. the previous head of ammb, ashok ramamurthy, stepped down on april 1 to return to australia to take on a senior executive role at australia and new zealand banking group ltd (anz). anz is the single largest shareholder in ammb with a 23.78% stake. it is understood that t c kok, the long-serving ceo of ammbs investment banking subsidiary aminvestment bank bhd, left the group earlier this month upon the end of his contract and reaching the retirement age of 60. pushpa rajadurai  managing director for wholesale banking coverage  is now its acting ceo. sulaiman will have his work cut out improving the groups image after several setbacks this year. earlier in july, ambank group came under the spotlight when the wall street journal alleged in an article that nearly us$700 million may have moved through government agencies and state-linked companies to prime minister datuk seri najib razaks personal accounts in the group. the malaysian anti-corruption commission says the money was a donation from the middle east. najib has denied taking the money for personal gain. meanwhile, ammbs share price has not fared too badly despite the recent developments. the counter fell by 3 sen a day after it disclosed the penalty. but on a week-on-week basis, it gained 1.1% or 5 sen to rm4.64 last friday. bloomberg data shows that most analysts have a hold call on the stock, with the average target price at rm4.97."}, "396": {"date_posted": "15/12/2015", "title": "higher tenaga dividend

its balance sheet and capital expenditure. \"it could potentially generate rm7 billion to rm8 billion in free cash flow annually over the next three years, as its power plant projects are gradually

reasonable as the bulk of the assets were relatively new and backed by long concession periods of between 30 and 50 years. \"we are leaving our earnings forecasts unchanged at this juncture, pending

kuala lumpur: tenaga nasional bhd (tnb), which sees a slowdown in domestic electricity consumption next year, is acquiring a 30% stake in turkish power company, gama enerji as, for us$243 million (rm1.05 billion), as part of the national utility companys five-year expansion road map to secure new overseas generation capacity. in a statement yesterday, tnb said it had signed a share sale agreement and shareholders agreement with gama holding as, international finance corp (ifc) and gif holding i cooperatief ua, a fund managed by ifc asset management co, for the proposed acquisition. tnb said the proposed acquisition will be made through a special purpose vehicle, which will be incorporated later. the deal is expected to be completed by the first quarter of next year. upon completion, gama holdings stake in gama enerji will be reduced to 50.5% from 73% currently, ifc 14.5% (from 20.25%) and gif 5% (from 6.75%). established in 2002, gama enerji owns and operates a portfolio of thermal, wind and hydro assets in turkey, as well as a large water conveyance project in jordan. tnb said gama enerji currently has a 840mw natural gas-fired plant and a 45mw wind power plant under construction in turkey, which will go live in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 respectively. it has also developed and operates a large water conveyance project in jordan. by 2017, it is expected to have a gross installed capacity of 1,027mw in turkey, it added. tnb noted that the partnership will give it two seats on gama enerjis board with extensive control rights, as well as the opportunity to place key senior tnb professionals, particularly in finance, operations and maintenance, in gama enerjis management. tnbs equity investment in gama enerji will result in a strategic partnership that will allow it to pursue regional expansion opportunities in terms of asset acquisitions, greenfield projects, portfolio optimisation and supply market entry, said tnb chairman tan sri leo moggie in the statement. tnb will also form a separate partnership with gama holding to jointly offer operations and maintenance (o&m) facility services regionally. this will allow tnb to pursue untapped opportunities in the regions o&m sector as well as leverage gama holdings regional leadership in epc services, said tnb. tnb president and chief executive officer datuk seri azman mohd said the process to acquire gama enerji began in december 2014, and was completed after due diligence by tnb and its financial advisers, unlu & co and ubs. the investment, which will be financed by a combination of internal funds and external debt, is subject to obtaining regulatory approvals from the turkish competition board, turkeys energy market regulatory authority and relevant malaysian regulatory authorities, he added. azman also said tnb intends to significantly grow its power generation assets in turkey, as well as look to expand further into the middle east and north africa by actively pursuing acquisition opportunities of existing power assets, as well as bidding for greenfield projects with gama holding in turkey and the surrounding region. in a separate filing yesterday, tnb said it had been granted a leave by the kuala lumpur high court to commence judicial review proceedings to set aside the notices of the rm2.07 billion additional assessment demanded by the inland revenue board (irb) recently. the high court also allowed an interim stay of all further proceedings, including the enforcement of the notices, until an inter-party hearing for the stay application is held, it said. earlier, speaking to reporters after the groups annual general meeting yesterday, tnb chief financial officer fazlur rahman zainuddin declined to comment on whether the additional tax would affect tnbs financial status. this is subject to the outcome of the appeal. we cant speculate what the result will be. right now, whatever cash we have in our business is the cash we have. we will continue to make the claims and wait for the decision, he added. cimb research analyst saw xiao jun said in a note on nov 30 that the quantum of the additional tax would significantly dent tnbs cash pile and raise its effective tax rates. saw said if tnbs appeal fails, it would have to pay the rm2.07 billion tax and its estimated current cash pile of rm8.9 billion would be cut to some rm6.9 billion. the quantum of the additional tax demanded by the irb is almost unheard of in the history of corporate malaysia. rm2.07 billion is equivalent to a value of 37 sen per share or 2.7% of tnbs current share price and 2.3% of our target price (tp). by adding the additional tax to tnbs tax expenses recognised in fy13 (financial year 2013) and fy14, its effective tax rates would rise from 9% and 10% to 26% and 25% respectively, saw said. in the worst-case scenario, saw said cimb would cut its tp for tnb shares to rm13.50 from rm15.70. meanwhile, azman said tnb remains committed to growing its renewable energy portfolio. towards this objective, he pointed out that the group is keen on participating in the upcoming competitive bidding exercise by the energy commission for new renewable generation capacity. we are also participating in feed-in-tariff projects with felda global ventures holdings bhd and sime darby bhd, and they have a couple of plants that are being constructed.

ammb holdings bhd cut its profit growth targets for the full financial year ending march 30, 2016 (fy2016) following the release of subdued half-year results last week  a reflection of the tougher times banks are facing in a slower economic environment. ammb, currently the countrys sixth largest banking group by assets, now expects its underlying net profit growth in fy2016 to be flat compared with expectations of 3% to 5% growth just three months earlier. in fy2015, underlying net profit fell 2.9%, but grew 7.6% on a reported basis, to rm1.92 billion. it also expects return on equity (roe) to come in at around 10.5% this year compared with an earlier target of 12% to 12.5%. as for dividends, it is now guiding for a 40% to 45% payout ratio compared with 40% to 50% before. last year, roe stood at 13.8% and the dividend payout ratio was 43%. the downgrade [of its fy2016 targets] is a reflection of the more challenging times banks are generally going through. ammbs current guidance implies that it is looking at a stronger second half of the year, a banking analyst tells the edge. it will be interesting to see if other banking groups tone down their forecasts for the full year, analysts say. it wouldnt be surprising as the industry is grappling with subdued loan growth, a tighter liquidity environment, weak capital market activities and rising credit costs as economic conditions weaken. an ammb official tells the edge, we downgraded the forecasts to reflect the [slower] economic outlook and the more cautious view we have on some of the sectors. that, and the fact that we didnt hit our mark in the first quarter  weve done better in the second quarter than the first  we wanted to be more realistic in our targets. the group expects the countrys economic growth to slow to 4.7% this year from 6% last year. now is the time when you have got to be cautious and you want to protect your balance sheet, the official remarks. ammb (fundamental: 1.50; valuation: 2.55) reported a half-year net profit of rm722 million, which was a 6.9% drop from the previous corresponding period, excluding one-off gains from the divestment of certain insurance businesses in the first quarter of fy2015. roe stood at 9.8%. the weaker performance reflected margin compression and a subdued operating environment. in the second quarter ended sept 30, net profit came in at rm382.5 million, which was 14.2% lower on a year-on-year basis, mainly dragged down by lower non-interest income. net profit was, nevertheless, 12.7% higher than the first quarter, helped by a write-back for loan impairments of rm63.6 million. ammbs net profit was broadly in line with expectations because of the loan impairment write-backs. pre-impairment operating profit was, however, lower than expected, says a banking analyst who tracks the group. a point to note is that the groups asset quality weakened over the quarter. its gross impaired loan ratio rose to 1.95% as at end-september compared with 1.8% three months earlier. analysts say ammb attributed this mainly to a lumpy real estate account that has since normalised, which suggests that non-performing loans could drop in the next quarter. for the full year, ammb is targeting for the ratio to stay under 2%. analysts expect margins to remain under pressure as competition remains intense. net interest margin (nim) was stable on a quarter-on-quarter basis at 2.12%, but was significantly lower than the 2.54% seen a year ago. the decline in nim over the year is part of a trend that began in early 2014 when management decided to reduce low-income household exposure in its automotive finance segment, from which it used to derive high margins. automotive finance used to account for 31% of total loans in fy2013, but now makes up 26%. the biggest portion of its loans are wholesale loans at 47% of its loan book. ammbs overall loan growth stood at just 0.3% as at 1hfy2016. excluding the automotive finance segment, growth was higher at 4.3%. for the full year, the group now expects overall loans to expand by 2% compared with earlier expectations of 4% to 5%. while the groups capital ratios remain within expected requirements for now, chief financial officer mandy simpson says it is reviewing long-term capital plans and structure to meet more stringent basel iii rules. generally, were still quite comfortable [where we are] by international standards. weve got time. well continue to look for options, simpson tells the edge. the group is unlikely to announce a review of its structure within this year, she says. on group-wide basis, its common equity tier 1 (cet1) capital ratio stands at 10.5%. at the holding company level, analysts say ammb has indicated that its cet1 is about 9.1% on a fully-loaded basis. at the press briefing last thursday, simpson said the group expects to announce the appointment of a new group ceo soon, having already obtained bank negara malaysia approval for its candidate. the edge had reported earlier in august that datuk sulaiman tahir, the former ceo of cimb group holdings bhds consumer bank, cimb bank bhd, was expected to take up the top spot at ammb once the central bank gave the go-ahead. sulaiman, 52, who had been with cimb group for 25 years, resigned from cimb bank in august and has been on gardening leave since. he officially parts ways with the

kuala lumpur: as 3q earnings season winds down, the weak ringgit continues to cast a shadow over companies, some of which are still reeling from the impact of the goods and services tax (gst) in april.  companies with high exposure to foreign borrowings have been hit hardest as the depreciating local currency against the us dollar dragged down their earnings for a second consecutive quarter this year, and analysts see no signs of this trend letting up. year-to-date, the ringgit has lost 21.6% against the greenback to 4.2535 last friday from 3.4973 a year ago, on concerns over slumping crude oil prices, rising us interest rates and to an extent, the political uncertainty. rhb research institute sdn bhd chief economist for asean peck boon soon opined that the ringgit will continue to trade at its current levels till the end of the year. i think the ringgit is now trading at levels that are reflective of the various negative factors causing its slump and i dont see it weakening further. i think the ringgit should remain at its current levels [till year end], he told the edge financial daily. however, this will still not bode well for companies with huge foreign borrowings that had their earnings intact when the ringgit was trading at levels of 3.26 against the us dollar as of september last year, compared with 4.3863 in september. the latest earnings season saw bursa malaysia-listed companies such as ioi corp bhd (fundamental:0.35; valuation: 0.3), telekom malaysia bhd (tm) (fundamental:0.8; valuation: 1.1), airasia bhd (fundamental:0.2; valuation: 1.2), airasia x bhd (aax) (fundamental: 0.2; valuation: 0.9) and ihh healthcare bhd (fundamental:1.65; valuation: 0.5) attributing their drop in profitability for the september quarter to the impact of foreign exchange (forex) losses suffered due to the weak ringgit. ioi corp plunged into the red in the quarter ended sept 30, 2015, primarily due to forex loss of rm853.9 million on translation of its us dollar-denominated borrowings. forex losses on borrowings also pulled down tms 3q net profit by 12% year-on-year (y-o-y) to rm166.87 million from rm188.85 million. airasia slipped into the red in the 3q, with a net loss of rm405.72 million in 3qfy15 due to a rm435.98 million forex loss on borrowings for the quarter, while its long haul-low cost affiliate aax saw its net loss widening by 36.7% to rm288.19 million, also due to forex losses. the weak ringgit also pulled down ihhs 3q net profit by 19.3% y-o-y to rm118.49 million from rm146.91 million a year ago, as its forex losses amounted to rm217.1 million. public investment bank bhd head of research ching weng jin said the real impact from forex losses to these companies will depend on the nature of the debt transaction. it depends on what kind of debt they have  whether it is an operational debt or an accounting entry that will be reversed later should the ringgit strengthen, he said. etiqa insurance and takaful head of research chris eng poh yoon concurred. if its unrealised forex losses, the companies are dependent upon the forex level at the end of every quarter. and with the ringgit now at levels of 4.2 which is not too different from where it was on sept 30, these unrealised losses will be much smaller and if the ringgit strengthens further they may even be reversed. however, for realised operational losses that are linked to ringgit levels on a year-on-year basis, those will persist for some time, said eng. share prices of companies affected adversely by the weak ringgit have also taken a beating after reporting weaker earnings. year-to-date, tms share price has fallen 4.1% to close at rm6.60 last friday, airasia has tumbled 51.1% to rm1.33, while aax has dropped 64.4% to 18.5 sen. nevertheless, jupiter securities sdn bhd chief market strategist benny lee is of the view that now is not the right time for investors to be accumulating stocks which have been impacted by forex losses. the ringgit may have showed some strength of late against the greenback, but there is still the imminent decision by the us federal reserve whether or not to raise its interest rates in december, which may cause the ringgit to depreciate further. so, i do not think now is a good time for investors to be accumulating these stocks, he said. jf apex securities bhd senior analyst lee cherng wee said with the ringgit volatility, a safer investing bet would be stocks that benefit from the weak ringgit. i think export-oriented counters [such as furniture makers, glove manfacturers, semiconductor manufacturers and timber companies] that have displayed stellar earnings thanks to the weak ringgit, would be a safer investing option, he said. still, cimb investment bank bhd head of equity research terence wong said its not all doom and gloom for sectors that are impacted by the weak ringgit. aside from the automotive sector, sectors such as the airline and consumer sectors have natural hedges that will offset the impact of the weak ringgit, and i think the latest round of corporate earnings were not as bad as expected. therefore for investors taking a long term approach, it will be a good opportunity for them to bottom fish, wong added. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score

sen per share in 9mfy14, largely due to an exceptional gain of rm1.34 billion from malakoff corp bhds listing. revenue was down 36.7% to rm4.09 billion from rm6.46 billion last year, due to the deconsolidation of malakoff's results, absence of substantial sale of land in respect of the overall development of senai airport city, and lower work progress recorded from klang valley mass rapid transit (kvmrt) sungai buloh-kajang (sbk) line project following completion of tunnelling drive works in april 2015. airasia x bhd (aax) saw its net loss widen 36.7% to rm288.19 million or 9.1 sen per share for the third quarter ended sept 30, 2015 (3qfy15) from rm210.85 million or 8.9 sen per share a year ago, due to higher foreign exchange (forex) losses on borrowings caused by the weaker

million from rm698.76 million in 3qfy14, due to higher charter flights revenue, aircraft operating lease income and cargo revenue. as a result, revenue per available seat kilometer (rask) for 3qfy15 also increased 25% to 13.78 sen from 11.02 sen in 3qfy14. for the cumulative nine-months period (9mfy15), aax's net loss rose 60% to rm561.82 million or 17.8 sen loss per share from rm350.92 million or 14.8 sen loss per share in 9mfy14, amid higher forex losses. the airline recognised unrealised forex loss of rm356.7 million in 9mfy15 compared with rm18.1 million in 9mfy14. cumulative revenue

million or 4.88 sen a share for the third quarter ended sept 30, 2015 (3qfy15) from rm69.28 million or 9.1 sen a share a year ago, due to softer selling prices of palm products and slower property sales. revenue for 3qfy15 dropped 13.5% to rm320.4 million from rm370.53 million in 3qfy14. the plantation group said the reduction was partly cushioned by higher contribution from the plantation segment in indonesia, where the impact of selling prices was more than compensated by higher production of fresh fruit bunches (ffb), as well as higher biodiesel sales in the downstream manufacturing segment. for the nine-month period (9mfy15), genting plantations also saw its net profit drop 45.6% to rm130.35 million or 16.86 sen a share from rm239.57 million or 31.4 sen a share in 9mfy14, while

2016 due to his medical condition. the plantation and healthcare group told stock exchange that it has accepted badrul hisham's resignation and has already found a suitable replacement, but did not name who. \"the new ceo will tentatively report to work on jan 1, 2016. the company will make the appropriate announcement on the appointment of the new ceo in due course,\" it added. wintoni group bhd announced today that it is unable to submit its financial statement for the third quarter (3qfy15) ended sept 30, which is due next monday (nov 30) due to loss of data following a recent break in of its office. in a filing with bursa malaysia today, the group said it required more time to seek third party opinion on the 3qfy15's financial statement. wintoni noted that if it fails to issue the outstanding 3qfy15 financial statement within five market days after the expiry of the deadline, bursa securities shall suspend trading of its shares with effect from dec 8. in view of the above, wintoni said it is in the midst of finalising the outstanding 3qfy15 and is expecting to submit the financial statement to bursa securities by dec 31.

the index rose on a rally from a low of 801.27 (oct 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,837.28 (low), 1,879.62 (high), 1,766.22 (low), 1,858.09 (high), 1,671.82 (low), 1,810.21 (high), 1,706.18 (low), 1,831.41

cci, dmi, stochastic and macd indicators showing obvious sell signals. its oscillator remains only marginally positive for now. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at the 1,567, 1,595 and 1,657 levels, while heavy liquidation at the resistance areas of 1,663, 1,696 and 1,727 will cap any index advances. the fbm klcis 18-day and 40-day simple moving averages (sma) depict an emerging downtrend for its short-term daily chart. the indexs price bars are now between the 50-day and 200-day sma. this depicts a neutral phase for the fbm klci in the medium term. due to the softer tone for the fbm klci index, we are recommending a chart sell on cimb group holdings bhd (cimb). a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that 24 research houses cover the stock, with six buy calls, 11 hold calls and seven sell calls. maybank investment bank bhds analyst has a hold call on cimb with a target price of rm4.90. pt cimb niaga tbks third quarter 2015 (3q15) net profit (excluding its mutual separation scheme costs) rebounded to 442 billion rupiah (rm142 million) from 93 billion rupiah in 2q15, lifting the nine months 2015 net profit to 618 billion rupiah (-73% year-on-year). the results were below expectations, as provision levels remained elevated. if not for the sale of bad loans to a special purpose vehicle, the banks gross non-performing loan ratio would have risen quarter-on-quarter. its special mention loans ratio jumped to 8.26% in end-september from 6.1% at end-june and the weakness in repayments was across all key segments. cimbs chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly down. its share price made an obvious plunge since its major monthly wave-5 and all-time high of rm8.20 in may 2013. since that high, cimb fell to its recent august 2015 low of rm4.45. as prices broke above its recent key critical support levels of rm5.50 and rm5.82, look to sell cimb on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term downtrend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd oscillator and stochastic) have issued clear sell signals and now show firm and obvious indications of cimbs eventual decline towards lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm4.58, rm5.50 and rm5.82. we expect cimb to witness weak buying at its support levels of rm4.03, rm4.22 and rm4.45. its downside targets are located at rm4.36, rm4.23, rm3.19 and rm3. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng.

"title": "lead story: large investment required in region", "article": " this article first appeared in capital, the edge malaysia weekly, on november 2 - 8, 2015.   an infrastructure company from myanmar or any other asean member could be listed on bursa malaysia someday, if things go according to tan sri munir majids plan. and with aseans aspiration to become an integrated single market, there should not be any hindrance to infrastructure projects seeking funds from other capital markets in the region. speaking to the edge in the capacity of chairman of asean business advisory council (bac) malaysia, munir says the council has proposed this cross-border listing to the regions leaders to take advantage of each others markets. for example, one might have assets to invest in but its countrys stock market could have insufficient liquidity. on the investors side, munir says there is demand for this kind of investment in the region. a lot of pension funds complain to me, our investments and liabilities are long term but there is not enough long-term assets in asean for us to invest in that could give us a regular stream of income to fulfil our liabilities, he recalls. putting aside for now the problems asean members have in forming a cohesive, single market towards the implementation of the asean economic community (aec), the countries in this developing region require an immense amount of investment. in a report last year, kpmg partner and head of aspac infrastructure markets roddy adams said asean needs an investment of about us$60 billion a year up to 2022 and expects the energy and transport sectors to take up the bulk of it. munir, who was a founder of commerce international merchant bankers bhd (now known as cimb group holdings bhd), singles out myanmar as one that has to address its need for power generation assets. and with a good reason. according to kpmgs report an overview of infrastructure opportunities in asean, myanmars demand for electricity generation is expected to grow 11.7% annually from 2013 to 2020. only cambodia has a similar demand for electricity, growing at an estimated 11.2% per annum. demand in the other countries in the region is growing in single digit  up to 6.1%. the kpmg report says myanmar needs us$320 billion in infrastructure investment by 2030. the asian development bank, meanwhile, puts the figure at us$100 billion every year, saying the amount invested is actually less than half of that. lenders are more inclined to support your project [with debt financing] if they know there is an exit. however, the listing must be in a market that is liquid  you cant have it (your company) listed in yangon, says munir. with this in mind, he is championing the idea of asean infrastructure project listing (ipl). he is looking at the possibility of allowing asean infrastructure projects without a track record to raise funds on bursa. it is based on what was done in malaysia in the mid-1990s when i was [executive] chairman of securities commission malaysia (sc), which helped in the take-off of a number of infrastructure projects, particularly in the power sector. the possibility of a listing without track record but based on authenticated strong future cash flows encourages debt financing because that possibility does two things  it is a reaffirmation of viability, [and] there is a take-out or debt-reduction source, munir explains. ipl shares are one such possible instrument. if they can grow into a viable asean asset class traded on national or asean-linked exchanges, such as a further developed asean trading link, they can meet the needs of investors and infrastructure development in asean. while the figures sound impressive and opportunities seem aplenty, can munirs idea be realised?  the asean-x approach the sc is aware that i am pursuing this matter, munir says, adding that he has also had discussions with ministers in myanmar, apart from other potential countries. indonesia, he remarks, may have some difficult problems accepting the asean ipl idea. many of the regions business leaders, including munir, have publicly expressed their frustrations at the lack of progress in smoothing the trading process between asean members  particularly with regard to non-tariff barriers  and in the opening up of their individual markets to realise aecs objective of a single market. indonesians, in particular, have been open about their aversion to the aec. opinion columns by ministers expressing the importance of protectionism and how the country can succeed on its own are widely carried in the local media. consequently, to push through ipl, asean bac will need to get the host regulators interested first, says munir. instead of getting all the countries to agree to an idea, he says he prefers the asean-x approach. pronounced asean minus x, this is a formula for the regions countries to go ahead with an initiative without having to obtain the agreement or interest from all 10 members. the thing is to make one deal happen and others will follow. i believe functional integration works better in asean, with a positive demonstration effect being a good catalyst, says munir. but executing a vision, however feasible it may be, needs perfect timing. with the political scene in malaysia clouding investor sentiment, munir says it may not be a propitious time to start the ipl initiative now. i do not underestimate the difficulties but i believe this is something worth pursuing, he concludes."}, "428": {"date_posted": "9/11/2015", "title": "split views on year-end window dressing", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on november 9, 2015.  kuala lumpur: views are split on whether the time is ripe for investors to take position in the stock market ahead of the year-end window dressing activities by funds, while fund managers say the current market condition is still bleak and full of uncertainties. according to bloomberg data, over the past 10 years from 2004 to 2014, the fbm klci would start to edge up as early as mid-november towards year end. during this period, the klci in december increased 1.88% on average, according to data compiled by bloomberg.  many have attributed this trend to window dressing activities by portfolio managers. however, fund managers say window dressing may be tough in a weak market, amid a slowing economy and external uncertainties. some funds can still do so, but it is not easy in a market with this kind of weak sentiment. it is more unusual than the normal years, areca capital sdn bhd chief executive officer danny wong teck meng told the edge financial daily. he added that it may not be a good time for investors to take position hoping to benefit from some window dressing activities by year end this time as it is an event-driven market. december can still be another volatile period, he said, citing the uncertainties of the us federal reserves (fed) rate hike, chinas slowing economy and low crude oil prices. last wednesday, fed chair janet yellen said a rate hike in december is a live possibility if data continues to show a solid expansion in the us economy. but still, danny said the resolution of 1malaysia development bhd issues by year end, as promised by the government, could be a catalyst for the local bourse. he added that fundamentally strong large-caps may have limited downside risk as valuecap sdn bhd is expected to receive some funds and may lend some support to the klci should there be any further downward trend.  valuecap should be receiving rm6 billion by the end of this month  part of the rm20 billion additional seed capital for the asset management firm to buy undervalued stocks in the local stock market, according to earlier reports. in terms of valuation, danny pointed out that as corporate earnings were not as robust as expected, the lower klci does not translate into a lower valuation. he said the valuation is not cheap for the klci compared with other regional stock markets, adding that the klci is trading at a price-earnings ratio (per) of about 14 to 15 times. he said the third-quarter earnings are expected to be weaker than the second quarter. this is not the kind of market where you see a lot of undervalued stocks, he noted. danny suggested investors to take a longer-term view and position that look into 2016. an analyst at a local fund concurred and said this may not be a good time for investors to buy. the overall market sentiment is still weak. the klci may dip further by year end and towards next year. no one knows, she said.  singular asset management sdn bhd founder and chief investment officer teoh kok lin said that investors have to be selective in view of the current market. one has to be very fairly selective as the economic condition is still soft. [the] global environment is still uncertain, he told the edge financial daily via phone. in a market where people are selling down, there will be some opportunities but investors have to be very selective. he noted that the main concerns are the weakening of the ringgit against the us dollar and the health of the chinese economy. he suggested investors to look beyond the local bourse into regional markets in asean and north asia to have more choices. however, research houses have a different view on the klci. yes, i think it is time for investors to buy. we have been saying that since august, said cimb research head of research terence wong. year to date, the benchmark index has declined more than 81 points or 4.5%. the klci once dipped to a 52-week low of 1,503.68 points on aug 25 but has been recovering in the past few months. last friday, the klci closed 2.84 points or 0.17% lower at 1,685.7 points. he told the edge financial daily via email recently that valuations are cheaper than before but malaysia has never been cheap and always trades at a premium to its regional peers. on sectors investors can look out for, he suggested construction, utilities and smaller-caps. we maintain our end-2015 klci target of 1,700 points and end-2016 target of 1,850 points based on an unchanged 15.5 times per. preferred sectors are construction for the long list of big projects to be built, utilities for its safety and smaller-caps for bottom-up outperformance, terence wrote in a note dated oct 23. meanwhile, in a strategy note dated last friday, bimb securities sdn bhd head of research kenny yee said despite the uncertainties surrounding the feds rate move, the research house still believes the local bourse will end the year on a firmer note with valuecaps rm20 billion remaining as the market enigma.  the delay in revising the fed rates has had investors making a return to regional equities, as all major asean markets closed the month of october on a high, he wrote. in tandem with this, he noted that regional currencies also strengthen accordingly. however, the debate on the fed rates had been revitalised at the time of writing, hence the ongoing uncertainties. meanwhile, yee said corporate results announced so far have been less than exciting with notable underperformers within the telco space. we reckon [that] there remains the propensity for further earnings downgrade albeit not much and will monitor the progress of the banking sector as analysts may look to tweak their forecasts lower. for now, we are maintaining our growth estimates at 2.6% and 7.6% for this and next year [respectively] with 2015 klci target still at 1,750, he wrote."}, "429": {"date_posted": "6/11/2015", "title": "will cpopc be a game changer for palm oil industry?", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on october 19 - 25, 2015.  hard times following the demise of the commodity boom are bringing the worlds two largest palm oil producers together once again. with the crude palm oil (cpo) price trending at the subdued rm2,200 per tonne level, malaysia and indonesia have worked to establish the council of palm oil producing countries (cpopc). so far, planters on the ground are unenthusiastic about the impact the new council can have. i dont know much about the new council, says a sarawak-based planter with upstream and downstream operations, when asked about the cpopc. another plantation player, who has over 15,000ha of planted area across malaysia, tells the edge, it [cpopc] wont work. there is a lot of talk and very little action when it comes to this kind of organisation. is it going to be like a cartel? such a cold response to the cpopc is not unexpected, and the questions raised about it are valid. neither the formation of the cpopc nor its intended purpose are new. the idea that a relationship of rivalry between the two countries can be turned into one of alliance has been mooted since 2006 u2013 with no tangible results to speak of. the cpopc wants to stabilise the cpo price, manage stockpiles, set new industry standards and work together against the international anti-palm oil lobby. however, the structure of the cpopc and how it is going to tackle some of the industrys challenges are not known. observers have drawn comparisons between the cpopc and other multinational coalitions like the international tripartite rubber organization (itro) and the organization of the petroleum exporting countries (opec). like the cpopc, itro was formed in 2001, during a time of depressed natural rubber prices. the aim was to boost international rubber prices through sales and stock management. in 2002, itro committed to reducing production by 4% and exports by 10% to support the natural rubber price. that year, the average rubber price increased 28.7% to reach 292 sen per kg, the highest level since 1996. again in 2009, itro nations agreed to cut exports by 915,000 tonnes and not sell rubber at below us$1,350 per tonne to lift the natural rubber price. opec, meanwhile, was formed in 1960, with the mandate to coordinate and unify petroleum policies among member countries and to ensure the stabilisation of oil markets. throughout its history, opec has used measures such as oil embargoes and production quotas to influence global oil prices. managing or stabilising cpo prices through production and stockpiles, though, would prove to be trickier for the cpopc, say industry experts. in the case of rubber, it is possible to limit exports in two ways, neither of which is readily available to palm oil producers. rubber producers can stop tapping without harming the trees, and rubber can be stored locally for long periods. in contrast, oil palms need to be harvested when the fruit on the bunches is ripe, and since oil palms are harvested throughout the year, the tanks at the mills fill up daily and have to be emptied regularly to be prepared for the next days production, says james fry, chairman of agribusiness research firm lmc international ltd. ivy ng, a research analyst with cimb research, adds, trees are not like oil rigs. you cannot tell them what to do. there are many factors that come into play  the weather, the prices of competing edible oils and stock levels. this is not to say the cpopc, whose members control over 80% of the global palm oil market, will be completely powerless in influencing the cpo price. fry says there are practical measures the cpopc can carry out  funding more tank capacity to limit downward pressure on prices when stocks are seasonally high, having properly funded domestic biodiesel mandates and having coordinated replanting programmes between the two countries. there would be undoubted benefits, both in reducing output from the areas that are replanted (and thus helping to lift prices) and in ensuring that overage areas are replanted with the best oil palm varieties (boosting profitability of oil palm growers in the long run), if the cpopc could promote coordinated replanting schemes and incentives in both countries, he continues. in that sense, the cpopc can put an end to current competitive policies in the palm oil sector used by the two countries. for example, indonesia imposed a new export levy on palm oil producers in july 2015 and is pushing towards its b20 target in 2016 to increase consumption of cpo. meanwhile, when cpo stockpiles soared to 2.49 million tonnes in august, malaysia moved quickly to try and stem its increase. this month alone, it has agreed with indonesia to introduce a rm100 million replanting programme from october to december 2015 for planters nationwide and to impose a temporary restriction on cpo imports. it also wants to implement its b7 biodiesel mandate by the end of the month. th plantations bhd ceo datuk zainal azwar zainal aminuddin says, it is vital that member countries do not compete against each other in developing new markets and meeting the global demand for palm oil. the market is sufficient for the two major players ... instead, the focus should be on collaborating against other competing vegetable oils. apart from stabilising the cpo price, environmentalists are worried that a cartel in the industry with its apparent desire to set new standards and lobby against palm oil opponents will allow it to do away with environmentally friendly production practices. indonesia pulled out from the roundtable on sustainable palm oil (rspo) this month and the cpopc has already said it will drop the no deforestation pledges made by major palm oil companies in favour of a joint set of standards proposed by indonesia and malaysia. whether these new standards can match up to rspos is yet to be seen. a failure to do so may come at the risk of losing more eco-conscious consumers. the cpopc will have to balance between the interests of planters and demands of environmentalists. prime minister datuk seri najib razak says the cpopc is a triumph of bilateral relations. the council now has to prove that it is much more than that.

marginally positive buy signal. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at the 1,567, 1,595 and 1,660 levels, while profit-taking at the resistance areas of 1,666, 1,700 and 1,727 will cap the indexs advances. the fbm klcis 18-day and 40-day simple moving averages (sma) depict a neutral trend for its short-term daily chart. the indexs price bars are now between the 50-day and 200-day

decline of about 10 points daily on tuesday and wednesday, we expect the fbm klcis trend to accelerate towards the downside in the coming weeks. due to the softer tone for the fbm klci index, we are recommending a chart sell on digi.com bhd (digi). a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that 31 research houses cover the stock, with seven buy calls, 12 hold calls and 12 sell calls. maybank investment bank bhds analyst has a hold call on digi with a target price of rm5.40 as its third quarter of financial year 2015 (3qfy15) net profit of rm397 million brought the nine-month fy15 (9mfy15) net profit to rm1.34 billion, which was below market expectations. digis revenue was expected to rebound in 3qfy15 after the industry suffered from the twin effects of both the goods and services tax execution issues and intense price cuts in 2q15. however, the service revenue remained flat, suppressed by intense prepaid competition. margin pressure could persist in the next few quarters due to the weak ringgit. digis chart trend on the daily and weekly time frames is very firmly down. its share price made an obvious plunge since its major weekly wave-5 high of rm6.44 in february 2015. since that rm6.44 high, digi fell to its august 2015 recent low of rm4.86. as prices broke above its recent key critical support levels of rm5.68 and rm5.62, look to sell digi on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to medium-term downtrend for this stock. the daily and weekly indicators (like the cci, dmi, oscillator and stochastic) have issued clear sell signals and now depict firm indications of digis eventual plunge toward lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm5.23, rm5.62 and rm5.68. we

article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on october 30, 2015.  kuala lumpur: malaysian resources corp bhd (mrcb) may face cash flow issues as it takes on two mega projects worth rm4.78 billion, analysts said, expecting the groups net gearing to double assuming full debt funding of the deals. they also see mrcb undertaking a cash call to fund the projects. on wednesday, mrcb announced that it had bagged two contracts to upgrade facilities at the national sports complex in bukit jalil here for rm1.6 billion and to develop a commercial project named kwasa utama in the kwasa damansara township here for rm3.1 billion. it also proposed a 70:30 joint venture with cyberview sdn bhd to develop 53.4 acres (21.6ha) of land in cyberjaya, selangor, with its 70% stake amounting to rm269.5 million. while we laud the managements capabilities in securing such attractive deals, we are not entirely positive with its landbanking ambitions and construction contracts being paid in kind which will further tax the groups cash flow, said kenanga research in a report yesterday. we are concerned of its already high net gearing of 1.12 times as at june 30, 2015, which will be further weakened to [a net gearing of] 2.27 times assuming full debt funding of these deals, it added. kenanga research noted that at 1.12 times, mrcbs net gearing is already relatively high compared with its peers that ranges from 0.3 times to 0.4 times. based on simple extrapolation, mrcb would have to fork out a whopping rm2.65 billion to fund its land bank replenishment ambitions in kwasa damansara, german embassy land, cyberjaya mixed development and bukit jalil. the research firm also sees the group undertaking a cash call to fund its various projects. hlib research said the contribution of the management contract with kwasa utama sdn bhd (kusb) is unlikely to be profound in the near term as the contract will be spread across 12 years. however, it is positive on the contract win as it would provide mrcb with a steady stream of workflow for over a decade. hlib research said the management contract would feed mrcb with rm262 million worth of jobs per year from 2016 to 2027. while the national sports complexs upgrading job significantly boosts mrcbs year-to-date job wins to rm2.2 billion, bringing its order book to rm3.1 billion, excluding the management contract and the light rail transit 3 project delivery partner contract. this translates to a superior order book cover ratio of six times on financial year 2014 (fy14) construction revenue, hlib research said. cimb research estimates that mrcbs net gearing could rise from 1.2 times to 1.8 times from the new deals, with downside potential via the groups ongoing rationalisation. mrcbs outstanding external order book (excluding in-house property jobs) stood at rm889 million as at the end of second quarter fy15 (2qfy15) and should be good for the next two to three years, it said. by our estimates, the projects impact on our fy16 to fy17 earnings is negligible if we consider the potential rise in interest costs over the next one to two years arising from the initial funding requirements of all three deals, assuming the majority of it is debt funded, added cimb research. affin hwang capital research said financing and execution risks are the key concerns given the large scale of the projects. nevertheless, the firm projected the management contract with kusb will lift mrcbs pre-tax profit by an average of rm15.6 million per annum over the next 12 years. the three projects will leapfrog its construction and property development operations in the long run, the firm said, adding that there is potential upside to its forward earnings forecasts and revalued net asset valuation from these three projects. seven out of 10 research houses covering mrcb have an add call on the stock, implying they are still bullish on the counter. however, kenanga research has placed mrcb under review pending further clarification from the management. it had a market perform call prior to this. shares in mrcb have been on the uptrend since aug 21, which saw the stock climb as much as 45 sen or

loan base. with no near-term visible signs of a recovery (in the economy), we believe the contagion effect could spread to its sme [small and medium enterprise] and other commercial loans, which represent 34% of cimb niagas loan base, uob kay hian research says in an oct 5 report on cimb group. cimb niagas gross non-performing loan (npl) ratio worsened to 4.28% as at june 30 from 2.97% a year ago, and is higher than the industrys average of 2.7%. the lender is due to announce its third-quarter results for the financial year ending dec 31, 2015 (fy2015) at the end of this month. analysts will be keeping a close watch on whether there is an uptick in its special mention loans, or loans overdue by up to 90 days but yet to turn bad. special mention loans were already up by 6% in 2qfy2015 on a quarter-on-quarter basis. it is understood that more than half of cimb niagas loan book is commodity and commodity-related, and with the continued slump in global commodity prices, new npls are likely to emerge. cimb niagas net profit in the first half of the year plunged by 91% to idr176 billion (rm53.7 million) because of a 391% increase in provision expenses (idr2.78 trillion). it has indicated to analysts that provisions in the second half will be lower than the first but will nevertheless remain at elevated levels. with growing economic headwinds in indonesia, the drop in provisions in the second half is likely to be much less significant that what they initially expected. provisions may have already peaked, but they will not go back to normal levels anytime soon, says a banking analyst. last wednesday, in a bid to boost the economy that has been growing at its slowest pace since 2009, caused by a collapse in commodity prices even as the rupiah trades at 17-year lows against the us dollar, the indonesian government announced its third round of stimulus measures in a month. the latest measures, which include cuts in fuel prices and electricity tariffs for the industrial sector, were aimed at reducing costs for businesses. they follow from earlier measures focused on cutting bureaucracy and streamlining regulations. some economists speculate there may be a fourth set of stimulus measures later this month. we believe the (recent) measures will boost sentiment but given the lack of external demand and slowdown in chinas growth, (indonesias) near-term growth outlook will likely remain weak, uob global economics & markets research comments in an oct 8 report on the economy. it retains its forecast that indonesias gdp growth will improve only marginally to 4.8% in the second half of the year from 4.7% in the first half. second-quarter gdp grew 4.67%, its slowest in six years. the central banks next monetary policy meeting is on oct 15, but the key interest rate is largely expected to remain unchanged. introducing stimulus measures is one thing, but implementing them is another. what weve seen with indonesia is that execution is slow, so these measures arent likely to filter through to the economy this year, for sure. for the banking system, asset quality will continue to deteriorate, a banking analyst tells the edge. jpmorgan, in a report on asean banks on oct 7, says indonesian banks are facing a credit cycle at a point when structural challenges are on the rise. we expect asset quality to deteriorate and forecast peak npls of 5.6% in the next two years from 2.6% now, it says. some industry observers say that one of the reasons cimb niagas npl ratio has been higher than the industrys is that, unlike other domestic lenders, it followed a different accounting standard that is stricter in the treatment of doubtful debts. the frs 139 accounting standard forced it to make provisions much earlier than the local banks did. as local banks start fully adopting that standard, youll see their provisions going up. but for cimb niaga, because it started early, the worst is likely over, says one. last year was the first time in six years that cimb niagas net profit fell on a y-o-y basis. its impaired loans jumped by 40% in 1h2015, accounting for close to 93% of cimb groups gross impaired loan increase in that period. analysts are keeping a close watch on cimb niagas performance, as it accounts for a substantial portion of cimb groups earnings. last year, it accounted for just 19% of cimb groups earnings, compared with about 30% in previous years. it has become a key sticking point in cimb groups (fundamental: 1.05; valuation: 1.65) growth outlook. malayan banking bhd (maybank)s indonesian subsidiary, pt bank internasional indonesia tbk, too has been affected by the slowing macro environment; however, the impact on maybank is less significant as the indonesian operation accounts for only about 5% of its earnings. uob kay hian, in its report last week, said it was taking a more cautious view of cimb niagas growth and recovery outlook. it now expects cimb groups net profit to come in at about 8% below a consensus net profit forecast of rm3.4 billion in fy2015, and 14% below consensus expectations of rm4.2 billion in fy2016. we forecast (cimb groups) absolute npl to surge 94% from fy2014 to fy2017 (indonesia: +187%, thailand: +45%, malaysia: +30%) with gross impaired loans to peak at 4.75% in 2017 from 3.09% in 2014. as such, we expect group credit cost to remain elevated at 80-85 basis points over the next two years versus our original assumption of 65-70 basis points, says uob kay hian. analysts have also voiced concern about the adequacy of cimb groups capital levels. its common equity tier 1 (cet-1) ratio dropped to 9.7% as at end-june from 10.1% in december, the lowest among the big banking groups, due to the high loan provisioning required for indonesia as well as its restructuring costs. there have been some concerns that the groups current fully loaded cet-1 of 9.7% versus some of its larger domestic banking peers average of above 10% may be deemed to be insufficient to weather the potential asset quality, currency and overall earnings volatility from its regional operations, especially in indonesia, uob kay hian says. however, the research house said that in its latest discussion with cimb groups management, the latter did not indicate any immediate equity capital-raising plans. the group is monitoring the macro and currency developments in indonesia closely. bloomberg data shows that of 25 analysts who track the stock, 12 of them have a hold call, while seven have a buy and the rest, a sell. the average 12-month target for the stock is rm5.52. last wednesday, the stock surged 31 sen to rm4.90, buoyed by improved market sentiment as the ringgit saw its biggest one-day gain in 17 years against the us dollar. investors chased up the stock, deemed cheap compared with its peers after it hit an over five-year low of rm4.46 on sept 30, despite moodys investors service having downgraded cimb banks baseline credit assessment (bca) and adjusted bca to baa2 from baa1, a day earlier. cimb bank is the groups consumer bank. the downgrade ... reflects the banks weaker capitalisation compared to its domestic and regional peers, as well as moody's expectation that further pressure on asset quality from slowing operating conditions will weaken the banks profitability and ability to improve its capital levels, moodys said. cimb group

power plant gets off the ground", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on october 12 - 18, 2015.  mudajaya group bhds independent power plant project in chhattisgarh, india, looks set to be commissioned by year-end after a long delay. should things pan out, the plant would provide a much-needed boost to the construction outfits earnings next year (it has been in the red since the fourth quarter of last year). according to an executive close to mudajaya (fundamental: 0.35; valuation: 0.90), the group  through its 26%-owned associate company rkm powergen pvt ltd  has ironed out all issues plaguing the project in north-eastern india, which had missed several deadlines since 2013. the groups local partner, rk powergen pvt ltd, holds the remaining 74% stake in rkm powergen. the first phase of the power plant will be commissioned within the next two months. mudajaya has secured all the necessary approvals and coal supply agreement to start operating the first phase, says a mudajaya executive, who declined to be named. according to analysts, the group is targeting annual earnings of between rm60 million and rm70 million from the 4x360mw power plant upon the commissioning of the entire project. the persistent delays have been the bane of mudajaya. the company, which specialises in the building of power plants, was once analysts top pick in the construction sector amid anticipation of steady earnings and cash flow from the chhattisgarh plant, in addition to profits from engineering works. the projects construction cost amounted to rm4.8 billion. mipp international ltd, an 80%-owned subsidiary of mudajaya, was awarded the equipment procurement (ep) contract  worth about rm3.4 billion  for the plant by rkm powergen. profits from the ep contract has been realised since the financial year ended dec 31, 2007 (fy2007). that year, mudajayas net profit leaped 91.6% year on year to rm30.14 million, of which rm11.3 million was from the ep contract. the group enjoyed robust earnings growth between fy2007 and fy2012, with its net profit expanding at an average annual rate of 60.9%. it posted a net profit of rm237 million in fy2012. however, its stratospheric levels of earnings growth has halted since then. in fy2014, mudajaya slipped into the red  the first time since it was listed on bursa malaysia in 2004  with a net loss of rm70.2 million. its share price has been on a downward trend, falling from rm2.90 early last year to a six-year low of 85 sen in mid-august this year. it regained some lost ground recently to close at rm1.04 last thursday. apart from the absence of contribution from india, cost overruns in some of mudajayas projects in malaysia also negatively affected its financial performance. furthermore, its fast-depleting construction order book did not help matters. the group managed to secure only rm55 million worth of new jobs in fy2014. but it appears to have seen some improvements this year  outstanding orders currently stand at rm640 million, with rm533 million jobs secured this year. while this provides a temporary reprieve, the catch here is that the new order book level will not last it more than 1u00bd years, given the annualised burn rate of rm450 million, cimb research analyst sharizan rosely says in a research note dated sept 15. in june this year, there were rumours that mudajaya was looking to sell its power generation assets in india and malaysia. the reason given was that the group wanted to focus on its construction and property development businesses. after its annual general meeting on june 17 this year, mudajaya ceo james wong said there were no plans to sell its power assets. however, he also said that everything is for sale if the price is right. an analyst who tracks the company opines that it does not matter whether the chhattisgarh plant commences operations by year-end or early next year as mudajaya would only be able to recognise the full-year earnings from next year onwards. initially, the first phase of the project was expected to be commissioned in 2013. in september and october that year, rkm powergen and coal india ltd signed fuel supply agreements whereby the independent power producer would buy six million tonnes of coal per year from coal india at us$25 per tonne. at first, things appeared to go smoothly for rkm powergen. however, several issues later arose in the supply and transport of the coal as well as the construction and synchronising of the power plant with the grid. these issues resulted in a delay in the completion and commissioning of the first phase. the completion date was subsequently deferred several times, with the latest deadline by the end of this year. basically, the delays were not 100% their (mudajayas) doing. there were several issues with regard to the shipments, construction and issues of them synchronising the plant with the power grid. so, they had to spend some time synchronising with the grid. there were also some logistics issues in regard to the transport of the coal. they needed a reliable rail connection to connect their plant with the rail line, says the analyst who covers mudajaya. the depreciating rupee also added to rkm powergens problem. the currencys depreciation over the years has substantially raised the companys cost, says the mudajaya executive. the rupee has depreciated by 34% since january 2009. however, rkm powergen has managed to secure a new financing package from the banks, the executive reveals. he says the paperwork was completed two weeks ago, and the funds will be available for withdrawal after next week. rkm powergen will then be able to pay the upfront payment needed for its coal supply, the executive adds. note:

the khazanah megatrends forum is rated pg, not x. i guess tan sri azman follows my instagram. but, he is right. some of my views on current affairs are considered unsuitable to be heard, by adults who decide these things. i will come back to this later. the theme of khazanah megatrends this year is around \"innovation\" and \"creative disruption\", and they have been comprehensively over-viewed this morning. in the next 30 minutes i would like to share with you some personal stories and anecdotes, and perspectives about why malaysia remains frustrated in its quest for greater creativity and innovation, risk and adventure taking, ethics and integrity in our economy, and how thinking about this problem leads me to the same conclusion as when i think of many other pressing national issues  we must address the \"elephant in the room\". capital as a 25 year banking veteran, i would be the first to admit that banks have been poor at supporting not just innovation, but many creative ideas. some who survived to tell the tale include 2 young malaysians who some years ago came to see me about buying an airline for rm1/- to build a regional low-cost carrier. i showed them the door very quickly and quite rudely, and was only nice to them when air asia was successful and going for its ipo. similarly, our experiments at banking start-ups and technology companies did not go well. banks are by definition conservative, highly-regulated and staffed with bankers. in the mid-1990s, in response to the perceived lack of access to capital for technology start-ups, i was asked to chair the \"industry action committee\" to set up mesdaq, the malaysian nasdaq. even before we had venture capital and proven technology companies, we decided to set up a stock exchange. and lots of money was spent on the new exchange when really it should have just been another board at bursa; it would have been a far cheaper failed experiment. till today i regret not saying no to this project; but it was a good early lesson for me and probably why i do find it hard to keep my mouth shut. as banks and the capital markets fell short, the government availed lots of money for technology and start-ups in general. funds like mtdc and several venture companies were seeded by the government. money itself has never been the problem. the problem was that we never had the institutional capabilities to allocate the money effectively, bias as we were to local intermediaries who lacked experience and networks, and prone as we were to proliferating agencies rather than building large institutions with economies of scale and partnerships with international experience and networks. today however, i do think that from a capital standpoint, there is much less frustration on the part of budding entrepreneurs and creative disrupters. equinas, for instance, has scale and leverages professional fund managers well. glics have evolved to apply best international standards in investing and now hire  and pay  a much better cadre of professionals for themselves and at investee companies. there has also been a proliferation of private equity and venture capitalists to supplant banks and offer more effective risk & reward structures. there is room for improvement, of course. i would like to see more funds made available to smaller companies and more focus on how to encourage large glics to better support small companies or small deals. i would also urge that we look at how to make it less punitive for banks to become investors in pe funds given the difference in the needs of our emerging economy versus the more developed markets where these new rules are being written. mentoring & international perspectives innovation is about three things  insight, idea and implementation. beyond capital, entrepreneurs need guidance to help them build their ventures. malaysia has had technology park malaysia and others, and lately magic, with varying degrees of success. i feel that one thing lacking has been the international element to mentoring. it is unrealistic to think of building sustainable businesses based purely on domestic dynamics in this era of asean economic integration and an increasingly borderless world. this is why a few other individuals and i set up the not-for-profit organisation endeavour malaysia in 2013. in partnership with endeavour worldwide we search for entrepreneurs via a rigorous selection and interview process by first the local management, then the local board and finally the international endeavour board. successful entrepreneurs are badged \"endeavour\", allocated local and international mentors, and are given access an international network of businesses  about 1,100 endeavour companies worldwide. endeavour worldwide is all about successful business people eager to give back by supporting new entrepreneurs. it does take an entrepreneur to know one and it takes knowledge from all over the world to assess the prospects of the best ideas. local mentors for malaysian endeavour companies include my co-founders afzal rahim, mark chang, brahmal vasudevan and tony fernandes. endeavour's \"mentor capitalist\" model has worked extremely well in latin america, where its biggest success story is mercadolibre, the ebay equivalent. marcos galperin started the company in 1999 and was selected by endeavor that year itself. he expanded the business across the continent and the company is now listed on the nasdaq with a market cap of about us$4 billion. marcos is the perfect example of how a high-impact entrepreneur can have an outsized impact on the ecosystem around him or her. he subsequently became a founder and board member of endeavor as well role model, mentor or direct investor in a whole string of emerging companies. i hope that we can rapidly add to the 6 endeavor companies that we have so far, but overall malaysian entrepreneurs now have reasonable choice of ecosystems to help them. beyond economics if we define access to capital and ecosystems as economics, then i would say we have over the years largely addressed the economic issues, but there is still no real breakthrough. recent data shows national productivity growth slowing down from 2.7% between 2006 and 2010 to 2.1% between 2011 and 2014. and other worrying datapoints include the story of two recent big malaysian innovation success stories  grabtaxi and happyfresh  they started in kl but have effectively moved to singapore and indonesia for various reasons. when i asked several entrepreneurs whether if given the choice they would choose to be based in malaysia, most said no, and those who said yes tended to strongly espouse their nationalistic sentiment. even though it is just my crude dipstick survey, it is worrying because we are at risk of losing the best companies that we nurture. so i asked those who said they would move away what their concerns are; without fail, they go beyond economics to the big picture, and relate not just their own concerns but perception of their potential international financiers and partners. role of the government the heavy presence of government in the economy is one issue they highlight. we have spoken and agreed ad nauseam in various other platforms about reducing government involvement in business, yet the data from the past few years show quite the opposite. even more important is the role of government in overseeing business competition- the rules of the game in each sector. much of this has been covered in the new economic model, and we are making progress with the government transformation program (gtp) and aviation commission, for instance. but much, much more needs to be done. the more sensitive area of concern is the perception that people or businesses are not equal before the government and even when one can accept preferential treatment based on our affirmative action policy, the rules are often not clear. added to that is a culture of top down decision-making, even in the sphere of innovation. let me share with you one personal anecdote. in 2004, i was appointed to the board of the infamous inventqjaya, set up by a self-described genius innovator, generously funded by the government with cash and a super smart building in cyberjaya. i joined 2 other independent directors, tan sri shahril shamsuddin and datuk sidek ahmad. from early on, we sensed things were not right and when we conducted our own technical due diligence there were a lot of question marks around the intellectual property the company had expensively acquired from the genius innovator's own company back in the us. the turning point for me was when he showed us his \"killer invention\"  a glass window which would turn opaque at the touch of a button. well, massage parlors in korea had had them for years  so i was told! shahril and sidek, who were both more literate in science than me, also found other dubious inventions. so finally, together with mof official dato rahim mokti, we decided that enough was enough; we had to do the right thing. truth be told, if we knew how painful blowing the whistle was going to be, im not sure if we would have done it! etched in my memory is the day shahril and i went to report the case at the ag's chamber. after spending a couple of hours showing all the evidence, the officer calmly asked \"did you bring your toothbrush?\" he said, based on his experience, people who make accusations are often the real crooks so perhaps he should detain us! so then we spent another couple of hours explaining that it wasn't us  thankfully we were convincing enough. after triggering the institutional processes, we were advised that we had to see and explain ourselves to tun mahathir who had firmly backed the project. after the ag chamber experience, we were too afraid so we ran to the master salesman tan sri nor yakcop and begged him to carry the news for us. i was told tan sri nor did a splendid job; tun agreed that we were doing the right thing and we were safe. the authorities never managed to build the legal case against the inventor. a lot of money was wasted, but a great deal more would have been lost had we, the directors appointed by the government, not done our fiduciary duty and been willing to tell truth to power. i have never fully traced the history of how and why inventqjaya started, but i was told it was by navigating the corridors of power and convincing the pm. tun's idea of a government backed r&d centre was good; the problem was how it was implemented. there could have been a tender open to scientists across the globe, for instance, as opposed to one man's full trust in another who went on to liberally use the threat of his access to power to get his way. i am sure there are other similar stories. so we need to recalibrate how the corridors of power work; reestablish processes and reaffirm institutional checks and balances. over the years power has become too concentrated and system checks and balances are not functioning as they should. human capital & education another issue that the entrepreneurs highlighted was human capital. i will not delve into education reform as many of our finest, tan sri azman, tan sri zarinah anwar, tan sri jeffrey cheah and tony were part of the national education system evaluation panel set up in 2011, and from what i gather, the issues are well-understood. there is of course plenty of research that show correlation between national propensity to innovate and the right educational policies. it's the political realities of education reform that seem to have held us back. on the wider issue of talent retention or drain itself, again much has been discussed via talent corp, etc, but then when i speak to the brightest overseas malaysians, the most often cited reasons for not coming home are socio-political. politics the elephant in the room is politics and the socio-economic structures that have evolved in tandem over the years. as we have seen over the last two general elections, the dominant political party system that we have had since independence is at risk. while we can point to many other countries where the transition to a multi-party system happens peacefully, malaysia has a unique and complex with a potentially toxic mix of race and religion deeply embedded in the political system; so we can't take that for granted. meanwhile, crucial reform proposals by many of our cleverest people like the neac which presented the nem that proposed major structural reforms, have been frozen by politics. i won't try to predict the consequences of continuing with the current trajectory of malaysian politics. but i will predict that if we don't undertake major structural reform of our socio-economy soon, we may well lose the international economics game. way forwards i propose that we go back in history. not to the early, joyous, optimistic days of the initial post-merdeka years. instead, let's travel back to the devastating blow we suffered on 13 may 1969  a day of infamy in our short history as a nation. a day that punctured our innocent idealism and introduced us to the hobbesian nature of reality. in the wake of that tragic and horrific blood-letting, the government declared emergency rule and set up a national operations council led by tun razak to run the country after parliament was suspended indefinitely. eight months later in january 1970, tun razak chaired the first national consultative council, or ncc, meeting to examine the ethnic, political, economic and cultural sparks that provoked the 13 may episode and undermined national unity. the nccs members consisted of just three ministers  tun dr. ismail, tun tan siew sin and tun sambanthan  as well as representatives from state governments, members of religious establishments, professional bodies, unions, teachers associations and political parties  a balanced representation of the population. the ncc's deliberations over a few months produced two extremely significant documents that guided our nation in the post-13 may years: the new economic policy or nep, and the rukunegara. parliament was subsequently reinstated while the nep spurred the growth of the government's involvement in business with the establishment of many agencies to facilitate the rebalancing of wealth amongst ethnic groups and poverty eradication initiatives, with considerable success. the nep epitomized what this conference is all about  innovation, creative disruption and inclusivity. so, here we are today. the nep that was set to be a 20-year program remains 44 years on, albeit in a much mutated form. in the meantime the world and our place in it have changed, not least with the advent of the knowledge economy and the shift in economic power from large corporates and institutions to individual talent and entrepreneurship. the near future looks even scarier as articulated this morning by charles leadbeater. supply chains have shifted dramatically and creative disruptors flourish in economies where vested interests are not protected by governments and politics. is our economic system substantially designed in the 1970s able to cope with the demands of today? we all seem to know major reforms are needed  there is already much good literature on reforms from the government itself  but implementation has been trapped by realpolitik. recent events are surely symptoms of systemic strain. i believe that just as in the post-13 may era, we are now facing a national challenge. back then, the fundamental issue was national unity. today, in the 21st century, the parameters have widened. national unity and the forging of a malaysian identity are still very much works in progress. but added to them are a plethora of problems ranging from the ethical to the practical, and even our quest to spur innovation and creative destruction leads us to this fundamental national challenge. we urgently need a new social and economic re-engineering program to suit today's challenges and for today's malaysians. my humble suggestion is this: the time is ripe for the setting up of a council similar to the ncc. lets call it the national consultative council 2 or ncc2. to borrow a leaf from history, let us once again bring together the best and brightest among us malaysians to huddle and deliberate our options. let the ncc2 be no different from the first ncc in terms of participation from all members of our malaysian society. its membership should be inclusive, its deliberations wide-ranging, and its reports succinct and practical to implement. and it should be led by someone or some people with the moral authority to bring the good and the great to the table for the sake of the nation's new future. my own ideas on how the ncc2 would function are still evolving. offhand, i would suggest the setting up of six panels to deliberate on the following critical issues, namely:\n1) constitutional reforms;\n2) electoral reforms;\n3) economic reforms-affirmative action, role of government;\n4) national unity and the social contract;\n5) preserving and strengthening the integrity of the federation; and\n6) institutional integrity  checks and balances between various branches of government and within government itself i make no apologies for adopting ncc from my late father. as i have written earlier, he was a malaysian to the core, a public servant to the extreme definition of that. i believe his legacy of an inclusive, deliberative, and malaysian vision and identity, is even more relevant today than it was in the dark days after 13 may. conclusion as i said at the start of my speech, there are adults who consider my views on current affairs as unsuitable. and they will look for 1,001 motives behind my suggestion of ncc2 instead of what i have just articulated. that is their prerogative. just as it is my prerogative to say we can and must opt for national  politics, economics and social-recalibration. we have to address the elephant in the room. malaysia needs innovative and creative disruption of a national scale to spur innovation and creative disruption in our economy. malaysia also needs innovative and creative disruption of a national scale to secure our future and realize the true potential of our great nation. we have done it before; we must do it again. thank you for your attention, i trust that i kept to the designated pg rating. "}, "445": {"date_posted": "5/10/2015", "title": "whats aabars next move?", "article": " this article first appeared in digitaledge weekly, on september 21 - 25, 2015.  news last week that aabar investments pjs voting rights in rhb capital bhd is capped at 15% took many by surprise and raises questions as to what aabars next move will be and whether the banking groups proposed rights issue to raise rm2.5 billion might be delayed. it could also put rhb (fundamental: 1.40; valuation: 1.65) back in the m&a spotlight, some analysts say. aabar currently has a 21.09% stake in rhb. it is understood that bankers working on the rights issue will be seeking clarification from bank negara malaysia about issues that arise following the latest development. this is something out of the ordinary, so the bankers will be seeking clarification to be absolutely certain on how best to approach the rights issue now. if need be, rhb may have to delay the timelines of the rights issue slightly, a source familiar with the matter tells digitaledge weekly. under the initial plan, the exercise was to have been completed by end-october. another source says there was communication between rhb and aabar last week, but that this was just a regular business update between rhbs management and the middle eastern investor. at that point, aabar had yet to indicate whether it would take up its entitlement of the rights issue. the revelation about the cap came about on sept 17 when rhb, in a stock exchange filing, said it had been informed by bank negara of the central banks order to aabar relating to the latters shareholding in rhb. the central bank, in a letter to rhb on sept 14, said it required rhb to give effect to the order prohibiting aabar from exercising its voting rights in respect of the shares held in rhb in excess of 15%. it also said rhb is prohibited from issuing any further shares to aabar in excess of a 15% shareholding, thus limiting aabars entitlement to the rights issue to not more than 15% of the issue. ultimately, what this means, is that regardless of aabars higher shareholding in rhb, it will only have a 15% voting right. it is unclear if this is a new development, or something that was imposed on aabar when it first emerged as a substantial shareholder in rhb back in 2011. the shareholding condition imposed by bank negara on aabar is in respect to the initial approval granted by the finance minister for aabar to acquire a 24.9% stake in rhbcap, rhb said in the stock exchange filing. the wording of the announcements suggests that this was already a precondition in the original agreement with aabar, says maybank ib research. investors will recall that aabar acquired its original 24.9% stake in rhb from its sister company abu dhabi commercial bank (adcb) back in june 2011 for rm10.80 a share. unlike adcb, which is a bank, aabar is a company and back then, bafia restricted corporate shareholding in banks to no more than 20% (the current financial services act, which superseded bafia in june 2013, is silent on this). as such, it is our assumption that it may have been a prerequisite for aabar to have pared down its shareholding within a specific time frame, which could have been five years, since aabar has just entered into its fifth year as a shareholder of rhb, its banking analyst desmond chng says in a sept 18 report. assuming aabar takes up 15% of its entitlement to the rights issue, its stake in rhb would fall to just over 20% from 21.09% currently. should the middle eastern investor decide not to take up the rights, its shareholding in rhb would drop to 17.5%. there is heavy dilution amid a rights price that is so heavily discounted versus book value, notes an industry observer. in 2008, adcb acquired a 25% stake in rhb for rm7.20 per share, valuing it at 2.2 times price to book. it then sold the stake to its sister company aabar in 2011, valuing it at 2.25 times book. rhbs current share price translates to an ex-rights price of rm6.12 versus aabars entry cost of rm10.80 per share, maybank ib research notes. the other major shareholders of rhb  the employees provident fund (epf) and osk holdings bhd  have committed to subscribe fully to their respective stakes of 41.58% and 9.97%. the balance would then be underwritten by a consortium of investment banks which includes rhb investment bank, affin hwang investment bank, cimb investment bank, credit suisse securities (malaysia) sdn bhd, maybank investment bank and public investment bank. moreover, it is the epfs intention to apply for excess rights of up to 2%, thus potentially mopping up part of the excess rights from aabars restricted stake, maybank ib says. with aabars voting rights capped at 15%, industry observers and banking analysts point out that this could potentially lead to fresh takeover attempts being made on rhb. i wouldnt be surprised if rhb gets back into the m&a spotlight as a target again. the stock price is at lows so a deal can still get done if its a stock deal, says an industry observer. however, given the current weak economic environment, companies have become more cautious about undertaking any m&a exercise. earlier this year, a proposed merger between rhb, cimb group holdings bhd and malaysia building society bhd fell through despite months of talks due to a number of reasons that included the worsening economic environment. it was no secret that during their talks for the potential mega merger, aabar  with its 21.2% stake in rhb then  was a potential stumbling block to the deal. this was given the fact that it had indicated it wanted at least rm12 per share in any deal  an asking price that was nearly 20% more than the rm10.03 per share that rhb was valued at in the proposed deal. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines

breed of resilient stocks", "article": " kuala lumpur: as the economic weather seems to be getting harsher amid uncertainties on the global front plus signs of weaker domestic growth, resilient earnings are getting vital. traditionally, toll road operators and power producers would come to mind when talking about resilient earnings. wait a minute! some of the ict companies, which usually may not be investors cup of tea, could be the new breed of stocks that offers better earnings visibility, thanks to the government-outsourced contracts in hand. these ict companies derive revenue from government contracts, for instance, providing it solutions for licence renewal or certain permit applications. to a certain extent, these companies are the dominant players in the respective it solutions or services they provide. their revenues are usually based on the number of applications or transactions processed. at the initial stage, these companies earnings might be volatile, as they normally incur lumpy initial capital investment costs. nonetheless, as soon as they have secured the contract and once the it systems are up and running, a steady stream of profits would start flowing in. a good example is probably my e.g. services bhd. and when the transaction volume picks up and the initial costs are paid off, profit margins will widen. there are two things to keep in mind when considering such ict stocks as investments. first, investors must check to identify how the net margins are like for these companies. secondly, they need to assess and determine the changes of these companies clinching another contract replacement after the current one has concluded, said areca capital chief executive officer danny wong. some analysts, however, caution that it might be over simplified to compare ict companies to concessionaires, like toll road operators and independent power producers, simply because the tenure of the government outsourcing ict contracts tend to be shorter compared to toll road and power purchase agreements. hence, there are risks of the contract not being renewed. furthermore, those contracts may be exposed to higher political risks. the following comprises some of the ict companies that have government contracts in hand helping to churn out revenue:  my e.g. services bhd one it counter which could be in a sweet spot is my e.g. services bhd (myeg). the company functions as a one-stop service portal to link malaysians with commonly encountered government agencies, capitalising on the modern days desire for convenience. their services range from road tax renewals, insurance renewals to even paying summonses. but in recent times, the company has managed to secure various contracts like foreign worker renewal permit. myeg charges a fee of rm35 on the government for each foreign worker renewal permit processed. it was also awarded with a six-month contract by the immigration department to register illegal foreign workers during the contract period which started from sept 4. myeg added that fees earned under this contract will depend on how many workers it registers. the company did not give the potential amount of fees it could derive from this contract. the increase in foreign worker renewal permit transactions and insurance has boosted myegs net profits for the fourth quarter ended june 30, 2015. its net profits gained 78% to rm29.65 million from rm16.63 million a year ago. revenue grew 27% to rm45.06 million from rm35.37 million previously. it is worth noting that myegs net margins have been in the 40% range since 2012. both cimb research and macquarie equities research have buy calls on the stock. last friday, the stock closed at rm2.85, implying that it has more than 13% upside potential according to macquaries target price of rm3.17. cimbs target price is rm3.92.  scicom (msc) bhd scicom (msc) bhd, which was once purely a call centre business has now diversified into education, government services and e-commerce segments. but what could pique investor interest is its contract to process foreign student visa applications from the ministry of education awarded in 2013. the contract awarded entitles scicom, that puts up the investment expenditure, to a percentage of fees collected by the ministry for every new visa application and renewal. the ministry charges rm1,000 for each new visa application and rm140 for a renewal. its net profits for the fourth quarter ended june 30, 2015 jumped 60% to rm10.59 million from rm6.59 million a year ago. revenue expanded marginally to rm48.13 million from rm44.7 million previously. for the financial year ended june 30, 2015, its revenue grew to rm176.83 million from rm160.14 million in the previous financial year. net profits leapt 49.5% to rm34.69 million from rm23.2 million previously. its net margins widened to 19.6% in 2015 from 14.5% in 2014. scicoms share price has been rebounding since mid-august but has yet to reach its high of rm2.29 achieved in april this year. based on last fridays closing of rm1.88, the stock is trading at a forward price-earnings ratio (per) of 17.09 times.  censof holdings bhd/dagang nexchange bhd censof holdings bhd (censof) is a global player through its subsidiaries with presence in indonesia, the united arab emirates, myanmar, australia and the philippines. the company has five main revenue streams  financial management software solutions, it infrastructure solutions, payment gateway systems, wealth management and training solutions. the company has bagged several government-related contracts over the last year, one of which was a rm2.8 million contract with talent corp malaysia bhd to train participants in the ict sector through its subsidiary knowledgecom corp sdn bhd. censof was also awarded a rm3.5 million renewable contract with the inland revenue board to maintain its accounting system through subsidiary century software sdn bhd. but the icing on the cake for censof is its 39% stake in dagang nexchange bhd (dnex), which was contracted by the government in 2009 to implement the national single window  electronic trade facilitation services. the facility offers exporters, importers, port operators, shipping agents and freight forwarders to clear goods and pay duties electronically with the royal malaysian customs department and the ministry of international trade and industry. the portal charges government agencies 75 sen per kilobyte and private users 85 sen per kilobyte for its services. dnexs subsidiary, dagang net technologies sdn bhd, is providing the service. its contract with the government for the nsw trade facilitation service was extended last september for another two years. the contribution of dnex to censofs business is significant, as it is the largest contributing division of the group. censofs segmental reporting for the first quarter ended june 30, 2015 showed that dnexs revenue contribution

datasonic group bhd but not all beneficiaries of government contracts are able to churn out steady earnings all the time. datasonic group bhd is probably one of them. its earnings have been volatile. the company has contracts to supply new polycarbonate mykads to the national registration department (nrd) and to supply polycarbonate datapage of passports also from the immigration department. datasonics net profit halved to rm12.35 million for the first financial quarter ended june 30, 2015, against rm27.7 million. revenue contracted to rm54.36 million during the quarter from rm71.5 million. the earnings contraction was mainly because its earnings are lumpy and dependent on the number of mykad and passport orders required for a particular quarter from the nrd and the immigration department. nevertheless, its net margins look decent, at around 25% for its financial year ended march 31, 2015. datasonics forward per is at 21.4 times. datasonic was contracted to supply 10 million raw mykad and consumables, valued at rm220.2 million, to the nrd which will end on may 30 next year while its contract with the immigration department to supply 10 million passport data pages for rm284.7 million ends on feb 28, 2018. the company seems to have fallen off the radar of investors in recent times. the share price has sunk to rm1.20 last friday, which pales in comparison to its better days when the share price went up to a high of rm2.40 in april 2014. since securing the contracts from the nrd and the immigration department, datasonic has not wowed investors further with new substantial contracts. datasonic was once considered a frontrunner for the contract to implement the fuel subsidy scheme via mykad, but since the price of crude oil has fallen drastically, the project has been put on the backburner.  prestariang bhd prestariang bhd which is principally involved in the ict training and certifications and distributes software licences but is categorised under the trading and services sector, has seen profits decline in recent times as well despite the rise in revenue. the company said that it was a consequence of the lower-margin nature of its existing jobs. prestariangs net margins shrank to 25.7% in fy2014 compared with 35.3% in the previous year. nevertheless, just this year, the company was appointed by the ministry of finance as the sole microsoft licensing solutions partner to provide microsoft software licenses to all government agencies in malaysia for three years. the contract is potentially worth rm150 million a year. despite that, prestariangs net profits for the first half of its financial year ending dec 31, 2015 came below rhb researchs expectations. we attribute this to slower-than-expected orders under its microsoft contracts, which the group previously inked with the ministry of finance and the ministry of education, said rhb research in a report. but the research house is expecting the financial performance in the second half of the year to improve, as its contracts which expired in may to july 2015 are up for renewal. one of it is the renewal of a rm20 million contract from the ministry of higher education to supply microsoft software and services to all public institutes of higher learning under the managing university software as an enterprise programme. the share price is currently on an uptrend following the plunge in august. last friday, it closed at rm1.98. currently, there are four buy calls on the share and one sell call. the target prices of the buy calls range from rm2.30 to rm3.05.

stimulus lifts stocks", "article": " kuala lumpur: sentiment on bursa malaysia was boosted yesterday after prime minister datuk seri najib razak announced broad-based stimulus measures aimed at strengthening the economy. analysts said the market welcomed a rm20 billion injection from the government as the fbm klci gained 2.25%, or 36.03 points, to 1,639.63 at the end of the trading day, while the fbm emas index increased 1.99%, or 219.72 points, to 11,248.84. however, gains in the fbm small cap index were muted as the index increased only 0.37% to 14,505.68 points. the promise of a rm20 billion injection into valuecap sdn bhd was a positive for investors, which will then be used to invest in undervalued malaysian companies. to give some context, rm20 billion represents about 2% of the klcis market capitalisation of rm944.21 billion as at yesterdays close. established in 2002, valuecap is an equity investment firm that is owned by khazanah nasional bhd, kumpulan wang persaraan (diperbadankan) and permodalan nasional bhd. hong leong investment bank bhd economist sia ket ee is of the view that the additional fund would help to restabilise the local equity market and give investor confidence a much needed boost. this confidence, reflected in the better performance of the stock market yesterday, could translate into investors realising that the economic fundamentals are still strong which would end up benefiting the economy, said sia. inter-pacific securities head of research pong teng siew, however, believes otherwise. he opined that the rm20 billion injection into valuecap would have a limited impact on the real economy. he does not think that there is a pressing need for the fund at this present time to be injected into the stock market as the market has not fallen to levels so low that it would require such assistance. currently, the klci trades at a price-earnings ratio of 16.65 times, which is valued higher than singapores straits times index at 12.91 times. in 2014, the benchmark index was priced at 16.29 times. yes, it will make money for investors but stock prices are asset prices and underlying volume of business activity of a company are two different things, pong said. pong added that the fund could lend some assistance to the employees provident fund (epf) whose profit this year could come under pressure due to the volatile performance of stock markets. it may help the epf and give it some leeway to maintain the dividend the fund declared last year, he said. alliancedbs research head bernard ching said valuecaps effectiveness in helping to support the market through the additional rm20 billion would depend on whether there is sustained selling pressure from foreign investors and how quickly and effectively the fund could be deployed. over the near term, bombed-out klci component stocks and government-linked companies (glcs) are likely to be the target of buying support by valuecap. while this injection alone cannot alter the fundamentals and direction of the market, we expect it will moderate market volatility going forward, he said. yesterday, the prime minister once again urged glcs as well as the private sector to repatriate their profits overseas and invest locally. ching said this move will definitely be a boost for the malaysian economy. he said the focus of new investments must be in new growth areas in order to avoid crowding out private investors, given malaysias relatively small population and the current dominant position of glcs in the domestic economy. epf chief executive officer datuk shahril ridza ridzuan said in a statement yesterday that domestic investments continued to be an integral part of the funds investment. the epf is constantly seeking appropriate local investments and will actively invest in long-term strategic industries and companies. in recent months, we have also been encouraging our global partners to invest with us in malaysia. this includes our recent logistics hub with the goodman group of australia and separately, with several global pension funds, he added. other measures announced by the premier yesterday included an exemption on import duty for factory sectors, an additional rm2 billion for small and medium enterprises under the working capital scheme, rm80 million for the tourism sector to boost promotional activities in asean, china and india as well as a housing loan assistance of rm200 monthly for two years to be extended to 20,000 married couples aged between 25 and 40 years earning below rm10,000 per month for the purchase of their first home valued between rm100,000 and rm500,000. sia said these measures bode well to safeguard gross domestic product (gdp) growth. he added that budget 2016, which will be presented next month, will probably present the fine-tuning of these measures and a focus on the cost of living. in a separate statement, cimb group holdings bhd group chief executive tengku datuk zafrul tengku abdul aziz said if all the economic stimulus measures announced yesterday are executed well, gdp growth could actually be closer to the upper end of the official target of 5.5%. he noted, however, there may be some time lag before the full positive effects work through the financial and capital markets and in turn, the real economy. the ringgit was largely unmoved yesterday, to close up 0.16% to 4.31 against the us dollar. the local currency has lost almost 19% of its value against the greenback so far this year, while the klci has retreated 8.95% this year.  this article

commodity prices and a challenging business environment, sime darby bhd saw its earnings weaken for its financial year ended june 30, 2015 (fy2015), and how it will address its rm18 billion debt remains unclear. the conglomerate is committed to strengthening its balance sheet  which saw net gearing balloon to 58% from 38% after the acquisition of new britain palm oil ltd (nbpol) in march  but has no concrete plans yet on how it will do it. we have not come up with a plan yet, it is still a work in progress. but definitely, we are working on strengthening our balance sheet, tan sri mohd bakke salleh, sime darbys president and group chief executive, said at a press briefing after the release of its quarterly financial results last wednesday. the intention is to come up with a gearing ratio that is a bit more palatable for ourselves and our stakeholders. if we can bring it to anywhere between 30% and 35%, that would be a lot more desirable, bakke remarked. but he also noted that given the cheaper cost of debt compared to equity, it makes sense to borrow at this point in time. bakke added that sime darby (fundamental: 0.80; valuation: 1.40) would also consider merger and acquisition opportunities to expand its footprint. everything we are encountering today is not all doom and gloom. even in bad times, there will be opportunities to pick up assets or enter into strategic collaborations with other players in the market. we have been receiving many offers from such players to partner or buy over their assets, he said. asked later by digitaledge weekly if it would consider gearing up further to fund potential m&a, sime darby declined to respond. a company spokesperson instead said sime darby hopes to achieve its target of 30% to 35% gearing in the short to medium term. analysts estimate that this could be done in six to nine months. there has been market talk recently that the group is considering a rm6 billion rights issue to pare down its debts, but sime darby has not confirmed or denied this. analysts tracking the stock, however, believe that a cash call may not be sime darbys best option as it would enlarge its share base and dilute earnings. it would depend on how the rights issue is priced for investors. unless sime darby can immediately buy something that is earnings accretive, would shareholders want to fork out the extra cash? asks cimb researchs regional analyst ivy ng. it does not seem critical for it to buy more assets at this point. but if the offers coming to it look increasingly interesting, then the rights issue might be an option to consider if it offsets the dilution effect, she says. in that vein, others point out that sime darby will have to hold off any major acquisitions until it has reduced its debt level. it is highly likely that until it deleverages sufficiently, it might not do another acquisition, or do a combination of debt and equity to maintain gearing at current levels, or even bring down debt, fitch ratings director of corporate ratings nandini vijayaraghavan tells digitaledge weekly. sime darby historically is always looking for m&a, but it is careful and most [of the] acquisitions it has made have been value accretive, she adds. in march, fitch ratings downgraded sime darbys outlook to negative after imputing debts from the nbpol buy. sime darbys ffo (funds from operations)-adjusted net leverage has risen to 2.5 times, well above the 1.75 times level at which fitch would consider negative rating action. interestingly, one analyst notes that sime darbys current gearing level is not untowardly high. the negative rating by fitch is the bigger concern because that will impact sime darbys cost of borrowing, he says. bakke had said at the briefing, we need to respond to what credit rating agencies are looking for. according to alliance research, sime darbys borrowing cost is currently 3.4% per annum. that said, sime darby may not have to actively borrow more or make a cash call if business operations improve and cash flow rises. as at june30, sime darby had cash of rm3.65 billion, giving it a net debt of rm14.4 billion. but earnings have taken a hit for fy2015 with net profit falling 31.3% year on year to rm2.3 million on flat revenue of rm43.7 million. profit before interest and tax from its biggest income earner, the plantation division, fell 39% y-o-y to rm1.15 billion as average crude palm oil (cpo) prices dropped 11% to rm2,193 per tonne. its fresh fruit bunch (ffb) production for the year also fell 5% to nine million tonnes. quarterly net profit slipped 17% to rm988.67 million for the fourth financial quarter ended june 30 (4qfy2015), from rm1.19 billion in the previous corresponding period. revenue was marginally higher at rm12.86 billion against rm12.56 billion previously. the board has declared a lower dividend of 19 sen per share for 4qfy2015, bringing the total annual dividend to 25 sen per share for fy2015, compared with 30 sen in the previous corresponding quarter and 36 sen for fy2014. the difficult operating environment has prompted many analysts to cut their target price: alliance research to rm7.40, cimb research to rm8.08, affinhwang capital research to rm7.59 and amresearch to rm8. if cpo prices start to perk up or cash flow from its businesses starts to improve, then leverage is likely to moderate and they might not need to take on any major fundraising, but it is still too early to tell at this juncture, says fitchs nandini. in an aug 27 note, she writes, robust cpo and other vegetable oils output will continue to pressurise the cpo price in the short to medium term. an el nino is expected to occur in 2h15, while the resultant adverse impact on ffb yield and output will not be immediate. cpo prices are still at a level sufficient for the large players to cover their costs and generate adequate operating cash flow. the credit profiles of even the large cpo operators would deteriorate should prices stagnate at the current levels or decline further. spot cpo prices fell as low as about rm1,860 per tonne in the middle of last week, over 9% lower than in the week before, according to data by the malaysian palm oil council. spot cpo closed at rm1,994 last friday while the benchmark three-month futures ended the week at rm1,802. sime darby is bearish on the cpo price, forecasting the commodity to trade between rm1,900 and rm2,000 per tonne up to end-september. beyond that, its difficult to predict because of the uncertain outlook, said bakke. the groups silver lining would be the added earnings from nbpol, which has already begun contributing to the group. for fy2015, it has raked in rm102.6 million in profit before interest and tax. nbpols palm trees are about 10 years and have brought sime darbys average tree profile down to 14 years. one analyst says that given its fairly young age profile, sime darby is in a fairly good position to weather low cpo prices. in the meantime, apart from more borrowings or a rights issue, sime darby is also considering unlocking value by divesting some non-core assets  a strategy it has had in place for some time now. analysts concur that monetising assets such as land parcels and its 30% stake in tesco is the best option for now. in fy2015, sime darby said that tesco was the main contributor in its others division, making a loss before interest and tax of rm35.8 million compared with a rm52.7 million profit the year before. this was due to a one-off impairment on property, plant and equipment and stocks, in which sime darbys share was rm89.2 million. most recently, sime darby sold off its 50% interest in sime darby sunsuria development sdn bhd for rm173.4 million and a 9.9% stake in eastern & oriental bhd for a total of rm319 million. but the difficulty in the current weak market would be finding a buyer, and sime darby has been burnt before. the group, which distributes bmw, hyundai and ford cars, has put on hold indefinitely the planned listing of its motor division that was initially slated for 2hfy2015. the initial public offering had been estimated to raise some rm2 billion but is now deferred until the market is conducive for the exercise. in fy2015, the motor divisions profit before interest and tax fell 25% y-o-y to rm473.6 million on lower earnings in all regions except for australia, new zealand and vietnam. sime darby said that the divisions sales in malaysia were affected by tighter lending rules, the goods and services tax, and the depreciating ringgit.   note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a stock is

markets fell on wednesday as job openings in america surged to a record in july. this hastened the perception that the us federal reserve may be on its interest rate hike cycle in september 2015. the us markets rose initially, sparked by large gains in china and japan. however, markets turned south after the jobs data emerged. the sp 500 index tumbled 27.37 points to 1,942.04 points whilst the dow plunged 239.11 points to end at 16,235.57. in malaysia, the fbm klci index moved in a narrower range of 46.11 points for the week with higher volumes of 1.68 billion shares to 2.56 billion shares traded. the index closed at 1,614.02 yesterday, up 10.66 points from the previous day as blue chip stocks like british american tobacco (m) bhd, cimb group holdings bhd, genting bhd, genting malaysia bhd, and rhb capital bhd caused the index to rise on some rebound buying activities. the ringgit was weaker against the us dollar at 4.3170 as brent crude oil inched up to us$47.20 (rm205.17) per barrel. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (oct 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014), and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,837.28 (low), 1,879.62 (high), 1,766.22 (low), 1,858.09 (high), 1,671.82 (low), 1,810.21 (high), 1,706.18 (low),

indicators showing negative signals but the cci, macd and stochastic are positive. as such, the indexs support levels are seen at the 1,503, 1,567 and 1,614 levels, while very heavy selling at the resistance areas of 1,620, 1,660 and 1,685 will cap any index rebound. the medium-term downside targets for the index may still remain at 1,448 and 1,414. the fbm klcis 18-day and 40-day simple moving averages (sma) depict a mild sideways trend for its short-term daily chart whilst the 50-day and 200-day sma have intersected with a death cross as well. therefore, this will not augur well for the index in the medium to longer term. furthermore, the fbm klci had broken a very critical neckline support of a major head and shoulder pattern on aug 10, 2015. the implied target of such a breakdown pitches the medium-term downside target at 1,448 despite its current minor rebound phase that began on aug 25, 2015 from the 1,503.68 low. due to the volatile tone for the fbm klci index, we are recommending a chart sell on sime darby bhd. a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that 26 research houses cover the stock, with three buy calls, 17 hold calls and six sell calls. maybank investment bank bhds analyst has a hold call on sime darby despite its 4qfy6/15 core net profit of rm1 billion coming out above expectations at 114% of his forecast. the fy6/15 results were weaker year-on-year due to weaker crude palm oil average selling prices and lower fresh fruit bunches output, declining australasia industrial contributions as well as margin compression from its malaysia, hong kong and china motors segment. he maintained sime darbys target price at rm7.98, based on 18 times financial year 2017 price-earnings ratio. sime darby currently trades at a high historical per of 19.1 times. its price-to-book value ratio of 1.47 times indicates that its share price is trading at a minor premium to its book value. sime darbys chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly down. its share price made an obvious plunge since its major weekly wave-5 high of rm9.60 in january 2015. since that rm9.60 high, sime darby has tumbled to its august 2015 recent low of rm6.70. as prices broke above its recent key critical support levels of rm7.95 and rm8.26, look to sell sime darby on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to medium-term downtrend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) have issued clear sell signals and now depict firm indications of sime darbys eventual plunge towards lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm7.19, rm7.95 and rm8.26. we expect sime darby to witness weaker buying at its support areas of rm6.07, rm6.70 and rm7.15. its downside targets are located at rm6.65, rm6.04 and rm4.99.   lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views

ago. net interest margin came under pressure, declining 24 basis points to 2.64%. playing its part, non-interest income jumped 17.3% y-o-y. movements during the year were a result of forex gains and net gains arising from derivative financial instruments. the non-interest income/total income ratio inched up to 31.9% (1hfy14: 29.4%). reported operating expenses surged close to 20% y-o-y, owing to one-off mss cost amounting to rm316 million. excluding the one-off, operating expenses increased at a slower pace of 6% y-o-y to rm4.3 billion. higher spending was recorded in admin and general (+10.3% y-o-y), personnel (+6.8% y-o-y) and marketing expenses (+4% y-o-y). on a bau basis, the cost-to-income (cti) ratio improved to 56.7% (1hfy14: 57.9%). sequentially, net profit increased on higher operating income (+4.2% q-o-q) and better cost management efforts. overhead expenses declined 0.7% q-o-q, aiding in a ppop growth of 10.9% q-o-q. the amount of loan impairments (-0.9% q-o-q) stabilised during the quarter. in terms of asset quality, the gross impaired loans ratio saw an uptick to 3.3% versus 3.1% in 1hfy14. this, however, was backed by a higher loan loss coverage of 86.1%

will be paid via cash or an optional dividend reinvestment scheme. the total interim dividend amounts to a net payment of rm255 million, translating into a dividend payout ratio of 20.9% of 1hfy15 profits. the increase in non-performing loans did not come as a surprise. the bulk of the increase was due to indonesia and thailand. the management believes the worst is over. the second half of 2015

overall outlook for the region continues to be challenging. capital market activity is also expected to remain weak. potential key upsides to earnings could stem from the ongoing t18 initiatives as the group is extracting value from cost savings (via the successful completion of its investment banking rationalisation and mss exercises), as well as acceleration of key businesses in the digital space, small and medium enterprises and transaction banking. the tp is maintained at rm6.50. we continue to see value with the stock trading at fy15e (estimate) price by volume of 1.1 times, below the industrys average of 1.2 times. buy maintained on cimb. key upside/downside risks to our fair value include: i) economic and political risks in thailand and indonesia; ii) additional lumpy corporate provisions; iii) a pickup in capital market activity; iv) a pickup in treasury and market activity; v) further margin compression, especially in indonesia; vi) cimb successfully reduces costs to below the targeted 55% cti; and vii) external risk factors due to uncertainties in the global market. another downside risk to the share price is the stocks high foreign shareholding level of 29%, although

lumpur: faced with shrinking margins and market share in an increasingly competitive environment, more and more listed manufacturers are shifting their focus to the property development business to reverse their fortunes.  this year alone, three manufacturing companies  amalgamated industrial steel bhd, takaso resources bhd and khind holdings bhd  have forayed into property development despite a softer market. their entry comes on the heels of furniture component maker prg holdings bhd and garment manufacturer yong tai bhd, which had diversified into the property sector last year and launched their maiden projects. however, not all will be hits. cimb investment bank head of equity research terence wong believes this is not a good strategy as the new business will dilute the manufacturers core business, which may not be what investors want. he cited mah sing group bhd as the only company that has so far successfully transformed from a plastic product manufacturing outfit into the countrys second-largest property developer by sales. wong noted that in the current business environment, it is difficult to replicate mah sings success as the market already consists of many established players that are big in size and can launch many projects at one go. he added that the cost of land banking has become too expensive as the value of land has shot up compared with a decade ago. this makes the entry cost higher for the new players. wong pointed out that the property development business is capital intensive with inherent risks, and property players need to have sufficient cash flow to weather the fluctuations in the market, particularly when the take-up of their launches is not as good as expected. for example, if you sell landed link houses, you can launch them in small batches, lets say 200 units. but for a condominium project of 1,000 units, you have to launch it in one go. a developer will only break even if it manages to sell 60% to 70% of its project. if their cash flow is insufficient, they will have difficulty [starting the project] because they will still need to find financing for the remaining portion, he added. wong is of the view that a viable strategy for manufacturers entering the property sector is to set up joint ventures (jv) with their more established counterparts and let the latter manage the projects. prg chief executive officer (ceo) of property and construction steven hooi said the groups move into property development was a strategic decision for the long term, to grow its balance sheet and earnings. he noted that property development is a dynamic sector, which traditionally provides high growth potential and good returns on investment. however, we recognise that the property sector is cyclical and catching the right wave is important. the current soft property market is an opportunity and time for us to seek out new property projects to build our pipeline so that we are ready when the market recovers, hooi told digitaledge daily. prg diversified into the property sector in april last year. its maiden project: two blocks of mid- to high-end condominiums dubbed picasso residence in kuala lumpur, was launched on march 28 this year, in a jv between its subsidiary premier gesture sdn bhd and almaharta sdn bhd. hooi said the group has seen reasonable take-up rate from the project. despite uncertainties in the market now, hooi believes that there is room for different market segments that still command reasonable demand, such as landed double-storey terrace houses, condominium units costing below rm600,000, and affordable housing under perumahan rakyat 1malaysia (pr1ma). he said the company is currently exploring opportunities to work with pr1ma, but nothing has been confirmed. the current market outlook is not as bad as it seems. both developer and purchaser with strong holding power will see through the current weak ringgit and political situation in the country, hooi added. prg returned to the black in the six months ended june 30, 2015 with a net profit of rm1.16 million compared with a net loss of rm1.22 million a year ago. for yong tai, its venture into property development has also brought the garment manufacturer back to the black. for the financial year ended june 30, 2015 (fy15), it registered a net profit of rm7.75 million compared with a net loss of rm7.27 million in fy14. yong tai ceo ng jet heong said its textile manufacturing business had been making losses for years due to stiff competition, particularly in china and vietnam. the group in april 2014 collaborated with melaka-based pts properties sdn bhd to build a 29-storey luxury condominium hotel called 99 residences. the units have been fully taken up. our financial results are testimony to the right decision made to diversify into property development. we found potential in this sector and shall continue to focus on this area, ng told digitaledge daily in an email. however, yong tai is aware that the diversification has its risk. the real challenge for us is how to transform yong tai into a reputable developer and be recognised by the public, ng said. another challenge would be the ability to secure land with good prospects for yong tais future property development activities on its own. in line with this, the group had recently signed memorandums of understanding with five separate companies, which will provide it with five potential projects with a combined gross development value of approximately rm7 billion over the next eight years, he added. we recognise the market is soft at this moment. after finalising and signing all the definitive agreements recently, we still need to apply and obtain approval from various authorities. we believe by then the market will rebound, ng added. however, cimbs wong warned that going into a sector when the market is soft and believing that it will rebound later, could be risky. at the end of the day, it goes back to the ability to sell. as long as you can sell, you can generate cash flow. but now, even some big developers ability to sell is not good. this year is going to be a tough year. if the company is new [to the property sector], how will it attract buyers? wong asked. shares in prg were untraded last friday. the stock closed up 8.47% at 64 sen last wednesday, for a market capitalisation of rm92.71 million. yong tai shares, meanwhile, settled 1.09% higher at 47 sen last friday, with a market capitalisation of rm55.96 million.  this article first appeared in digitaledge

committee is only the first stage, munir told reporters yesterday, adding that it has to come out with recommendations immediately, given the pressing condition now. citing the revised budget as an example, munir said the current crude oil prices had plunged below the governments projection of us$50 (rm212.50) to us$60 per barrel. the committee has to come out with a mitigation plan to address the issue, he added. on the weaker ringgit, munir said it was caused by multiple reasons, including the countrys domestic political turmoil.

valuation: 1.10) undertook an exercise, called career transition scheme (cts). the scheme cost the telco rm143 million, and in its 2013 annual report, it says the cst enabled it to better align skill sets with business priorities. the operating landscape is tough for all businesses, not just telcos. but looking at that sector, the second quarter is expected to be tougher as it still faces gst confusion. we expect things to pick up in the second half of the year, says a local telco analyst. on axiata (fundamental: 0.85;

valuation: 1.50) and a higher target price of rm4.25. it says it continues to be upbeat on the companys prospects. its analyst paul yap says in a may 15 report that the companys future earnings will be driven by the recent completion of its plant, p13. this is supported by robust demand in the smartphone sector and a favourable exchange rate. inari weathered the recent selldown in the ace market to climb 68.07% from oct 16 last year to rm3.30 last friday. in a may 27 announcement to bursa, education stock eduspec (fundamental: 2.50; valuation: 0.80) said it expects to achieve higher revenue contribution from its ventures in indonesia, vietnam and the philippines and will continue to grow its products and services in the domestic market. eduspec is one of the counters that contributed to the decline on the ace market. its shares closed at 32.5 sen last friday, after having gained 90.91% from oct 16 last year to a high of 42 sen on april 16. on a brighter note, managepays wholly-owned subsidiary, managepay resources sdn bhd (mrsb), has received a letter of notification from unionpay international co ltd on the registration of mrsb as a unionpay third-party service provider. upon registration, the electronic payment solutions provider will be responsible for switching and gateway services, system operation and product management of unionpay card issuance in malaysia, myanmar, thailand, singapore and indonesia. in a may 26 announcement to bursa, the company said it hopes to capture the growth in the payment industry by offering end-to-end epayment and emoney solutions to large retailers, shopping complexes and business communities in the next five years. managepay (fundamental: 1.30; valuation: 0) climbed 105.71% from dec 15 last year to a high of 36 sen on may 15. it finished at 29.5 sen last friday. thermal and acoustic applications manufacturer oceancash (fundamental: 1; valuation: 0.80) is trading at a historical per of 15.63 times. its net profit rose 24.18% year on year to rm2.22 million in its first quarter ended march 31, 2015, while revenue was 17.22% higher at rm20.4 million. eps improved to one sen from 0.8 sen. in an announcement on may 28, the company said the improved revenue was due to the better performance of its felts division in malaysia and non-woven division in thailand. for its full year ended march 31, 2015, systech (fundamental: 1.65; valuation: 1.10) posted a net profit of rm3 million, which was up 70.46% from last year. revenue was 17.57% higher at rm2.57 million. the company attributed the higher revenue to the contribution of its franchise software system. the web-based solutions provider has a current per of 27.6 times. opensys (m) bhd (fundamental: 1.30; valuation: 1.40), meanwhile, raked in a net profit of rm3.12 million in its first quarter ended march 31, 2015. this was up 67.47% y-o-y. revenue soared 194.87% to rm27.43 million while eps improved to 1.39 sen from 0.83 sen. in a may 26 statement to bursa, the financial services provider said the results were due to higher revenue achieved from business process outsourcing and the sale of a cash recycling machine. it has a per of 12.21 times. apart from ifca msc, solar power plant player vsolar group bhd and consumer electronics outfit k-one technology bhd too fluctuated wildly. vsolar jumped 245.45% from jan 9 to 38 sen on april 22 while k-one soared 163.84% from oct 16 last year to 64 sen on may 18. but by last thursday, the stocks had retreated to 14 sen and 26 sen respectively. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers. a score of 3 suggests strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. visit www.theedgemarkets.com for more details on a companys financial dashboard. this article first appeared in capital, the edge malaysia weekly, on june 22 - 28, 2015.

tonne over the past six months, the earnings of plantation companies have continued to weaken, as reflected in the latest results season. a key concern now is that despite a slew of bullish catalysts on the horizon, such as el niu00f1o and indonesias b15 implementation, major plantation players remain encumbered by lower operating margins as well as high unrealised foreign exchange losses. weaker average selling prices and lower fresh fruit bunch (ffb) output in the first quarter of the year resulted in a major earnings decline among the upstream players. apart from the decline in revenue, the lower ffb output has also dented operating margins, as millers were underutilised following floods in the east coast states late last year. rabobank international director of food and agribusiness research pawan kumar says the earnings outlook for plantation firms remains bleak for the rest of the year. we forecast both production and cpo prices to remain weak in the second quarter. existing negative fundamentals will hit the pure players the hardest. but the integrated players are better capitalised and can actively pursue income diversification. those with downstream exposure in indonesia have an added advantage, he says. this will put the spotlight on companies such as singapore-listed wilmar international ltd and golden agri-resources ltd, which are large integrated players with substantial downstream operations in indonesia. the indonesian government has big plans to support domestic palm oil consumption, including its push for the implementation of the b15 biodiesel mandate as well as export levies of us$50 per tonne for cpo and us$30 per tonne for processed palm oil products. the two initiatives will stoke up domestic demand in indonesia, which in turn will help the refiners that are currently operating at well below capacity. the proposed levies will go towards subsidising its biodiesel industry, incentivising plantation companies to ramp up production. in the near term, we prefer integrated players that are able to enjoy the margin difference on the levy of us$20 per tonne between upstream and downstream products, says cimb research analyst maureen natasha in a may research note. wilmar (fundamental: 0.80; valuation: 1.00) owns two biodiesel plants in indonesia with a combined capacity of two million kilolitres per annum. similarly, golden agri-resources (fundamental: 0.55; valuation: 1.20) has committed up to us$300 million to expand its downstream operations in indonesia. jakarta-listed integrated players such as pt astra agro lestari tbk and pt salim ivomas pratama tbk are also expected to benefit, as palm oil exports form only a small proportion of their total sales. malaysian integrated players look set to continue to be affected by weaker upstream contributions and lack of government support in the downstream segment. with no direct subsidies, unlike in indonesia, refiners continue to operate well below capacity and post losses due to negative refining margins. the reliance on contributions from the upstream segment was reflected in the recent results for the quarter ended march 31, which seemed to have underwhelmed analysts consensus expectations. for example, sime darby bhds plantations division saw its gross profit decline 7.8% y-o-y to rm99.6 million for the quarter ended march 31, 2015, due to low production and weak selling prices. profit at its midstream and downstream operations fell 55.3% to rm30.3 million from rm67.8 million a year ago. the lower profit was attributable to lower off-take of biodiesel from petroleum companies due to the drop in crude oil prices and lower sales volume of differentiated products, sime darby (fundamental: 0.80; valuation: 1.40) says in notes to its financial statements. major players such as felda global ventures bhd (fgv) and genting plantations bhd saw double-digit percentage declines in their ffb production on an annual basis, which affected their gross incomes. for 1qfy2015, fgv (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 1.40) reported a 38% drop in gross profit to rm363.1 million year-on-year while genting plantations (fundamental: 1.20; valuation: 1.10) saw its gross profit fall 25% y-o-y to rm115.1 million. however, even gross profits are being diluted from the companies foreign exchange exposure, as has been the case over the past year. the ringgit and rupiah have plummeted to new multi-year lows. it is not just a question of compressed margins anymore. unrealised forex losses are a long-term burden as we do not see any recovery for asian currencies against the us dollar. while unseasonable weather can bring down production from record high levels, regional and global demand for palm oil is still the key determinant of prices, says a plantations analyst at a bank-backed research house. the forex exposure of some of the integrated players has impacted their net income. for example, ioi corp bhd (fundamental: 1.20; valuation: 1.10) reported a net loss of rm188 million on the back of unrealised forex losses of rm333 million. similarly, ijm plantations bhd (fundamental: 1.60; valuation: 0.80) saw its net profit dwindle to rm10 million in its latest quarterly results, largely due to unrealised forex losses of rm51.36 million. rabobanks kumar says a silver lining for the upstream players would be the growth in indias demand for palm oil. imports should continue to pick up this year mainly because there is not a lot of domestic supply in india. an expected widening of the spread between soy oil and palm oil prices will also be supportive of the latter, as edible oil consumers will become more price sensitive. weak demand for palm oil this year has resulted in a growing stockpile, despite the bump in exports seen recently. according to malaysian palm oil board data, the closing stock of crude and processed palm oil in malaysia amounted to 2.19 million tonnes, not far from the all-time high of 2.62 million tonnes recorded in 2013. the government has decided to keep export tax at zero until the end of june in a bid to clear existing stock. the bullish catalysts, while good for investor sentiment, is unlikely to have an impact on cpos fundamentals anytime soon, at least until the current stockpile can be meaningfully reduced. according to anglo-eastern plantations plc executive director of finance datuk lim ewe chuan, this is the main factor that influences the industrys future prospects. in the near term, any upside on the cpo price may be limited in view of seasonally higher production and large stockpiles, he says.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on june 1 - 7, 2015."}, "483": {"date_posted": "26/6/2015", "title": "klci loses 6.34 pts as ringgit

"}, "484": {"date_posted": "26/6/2015", "title": "cover story: kl real estate diverges", "article": " the big-ticket commercial real estate market in kuala lumpur has attracted considerable interest in the past 18 months, judging from the number of deals involving development land and office towers that have fetched record prices. what is interesting is that consumer sentiment on condominiums and serviced apartments in kl was weakening even as these huge undertakings involving corporate buyers and institutional investors picked up. not only did transactions of non-landed residences, for example in the klcc area, decline or remain flat overall last year but average prices softened in 3q2014 to rm1,076 psf from rm1,167 psf in 4q2013. in contrast, due to renewed buying interest, prices per square foot in the klcc area remained strong and are now at around rm3,280 psf for land and rm1,400 psf for office space. to show how active corporate and institutional buyers have been, over rm6.7 billion worth of transactions involving land and commercial buildings, excluding three tun razak exchange (trx) deals worth at least rm2.7 billion, have been either completed or executed since early last year, according to a compilation by the edge. meanwhile, another rm3.5 billion worth of commercial buildings in downtown kl have been put on the market. the above values are based on reports and announcements made over the past 1u00bd years (see table 1 on page 65). however, there could have been some private deals, which means the real value of transactions executed since early last year could be bigger. in fact, property consultants describe this 18-month period as one of the most dynamic for commercial real estate in over a decade and the monetary value as a record. the market is very vibrant. the last time it was like this was about a decade ago, zerin properties ceo previndran singhe tells the edge. the fact that property consultancy firm rahim & co sealed deals to the tune of rm2 billion in the past three months alone shows the vigour of kls commercial real estate scene. in april, the firm handled the sale of integra tower, which forms part of the intermark in jalan ampang, by us-based fund manager blackrock to kwap (kumpulan wang persaraan [diperbadankan]) for a whopping rm1.065 billion. it also handled the sale of menara cimb in kl sentral to cimb group for rm646 million and was appointed to seek buyers for the german embassy land in jalan kia peng. the size of these deals generated a lot of attention. a decade ago, we did not see many transactions above rm1 billion. values have become so big now because of asset inflation. for instance, land price has doubled or tripled [from 10 years ago]. it used to be rm1,000 psf in the klcc area in 2006 and 2007. today, it is over rm3,000 psf, rahim & co managing director of real estate agents robert ang tells the edge.  why the sudden surge in interest? property experts cite a weak ringgit and ample liquidity in the financial system and capital market for the robust transactions. the sudden surge in interest could be due to the malaysian market looking attractive to investors. this is mainly due to the us dollar strengthening against the ringgit and the still strong fundamentals of our property market, reasons previndran. he points out that while institutional investors have always eyed kls commercial real estate, the ailing local currency has boosted their interest. the ringgit started to depreciate against the us dollar last september. it dropped to as low as 3.72 in early march from 3.14 in august last year, and is currently hovering at around 3.65. some point to the local institutional funds and major developers that are flush with cash. there is a lot of liquidity in the market, whether from the employees provident fund (epf) or lembaga tabung haji. large developers, which have been making huge profits, are also contributing to the liquidity in the property market, rahim & cos ang points out. when these factors come together in an environment of stable and low interest rates, institutional investors are motivated to invest in real estate, he adds. moreover, government-linked companies (glcs) and statutory bodies were directed by the ministry of finance (mof) late last december to prioritise domestic investments and postpone foreign asset acquisitions in order to contain capital outflows and boost local consumption. this could have motivated putrajaya ventures sdn bhd, a unit of putrajaya holdings sdn bhd, to recently buy the 7.98-acre french embassy land in jalan ampang for rm834.26 million, a few weeks after another glc, malaysian resources corp bhd (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 0.8), bought the nearby 1.87-acre german embassy site for rm259.2 million. putrajaya holdings, the master developer of putrajaya city, is owned by petroliam nasional bhd, kumpulan wang amanah negara and khazanah nasional bhd. meanwhile, after purchasing integra tower, kwap was said to be considering buying a plot in trx from 1malaysia development bhd (1mdb) to build an office tower but that changed after tabung hajis acquisition of 1.56 acres in trx for rm188.5 million caused a furore. nevertheless, indonesias mulia group has signed with 1mdb to acquire 3.4 acres in trx for rm665 million, though there are scant details of the deal. when contacted, laurelcap sdn bhd director stanley toh agrees that the weak ringgit is contributing to the surge in commercial real-estate transactions in kl but adds that malaysias relatively cheap land on a psf basis is also a lure. besides, he says, foreigners can wholly own freehold land in this country unlike in thailand, the philippines or even cambodia.  if the price is right u2026 in kl alone, a substantial number of commercial buildings  office, hotel and retail  as well as parcels of land are available for sale (see table 2). rahim & co was appointed to put all the components of the intermark, except the double tree by hilton, up for sale. two of the components  vista tower and the mall  have yet to be sold. the former is going for rm600 million and the latter for rm155 million. there are also some property owners who are willing to divest their assets if the price is right. goldis bhd (fundamental: 0.5; valuation: 1.1) ceo tan lei cheng recently said the company was willing to let go of its hotel-cum-office building, g-tower, for rm1.3 billion. renaissance kuala lumpur hotel, which belongs to goldis subsidiary igb corp bhd (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 2.0), is probably another piece of real estate that may be sold if the price is right. in fact, over the years, news of this hospitality asset being available for sale has surfaced several times. within trx itself, many more acres are likely available for sale based on news reports that have appeared thus far. the single largest area  covering 17 acres  of the 70-acre development is to be jointly developed by sydney-based lend lease and 1mdb real estate sdn bhd. other known transactions, including by tabung haji and mulia group, would take up just a fraction of trx. of late, there have been some noticeable trends when it comes to the transaction of huge commercial property in kl with most of the selling parties being foreign investment funds and foreign governments. while the former typically recycle their property asset portfolio every few years, recently, the latter have begun to sell embassy land in order to move their consulates into office buildings and also to unlock value. as for the sale of old office buildings, laurelcaps toh attributes this to the softening rental market and falling yields. yields are declining because offices are also moving out of the city to the fringe of kuala lumpur, such as bangsar south and kl sentral, he says. these buildings offer their new owners the opportunity to refurbish, renovate, rebuild and even reposition. the building should be redeveloped according to the demand for and supply of that particular product in the area, remarks toh, citing office building menara ing in jalan raja chulan, whose transformation will include hotels because of the high demand for rooms in the city centre. he also reckons that many owners will liquidate their properties if they think the prices are high, ahead of a possible slowdown. the kuala lumpur city council has also made redevelopment more alluring by approving a higher plot ratio, which means the developer can get more out of every square foot of space he invests in and potentially make higher margins. in the meantime, rahim & cos ang expects transactions of big-ticket commercial real estate in kl to continue to excite over the next two years, especially due to the scarcity of land. and as toh points out, there will always be buyers looking for bargains. there are those who are flush with cash but they would rather adopt a wait-and-see stance. their objective is to reserve cash and pounce on any good deal that arises in the softening property market.  note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on

year 2015 to 2017 ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) and core eps (earnings per share) forecasts for digi.com bhd, axiata group bhd and maxis bhd to factor in more

may pare down usage) rather than on top of the usual top-up card prices, foong noted. putrajaya had on may 13, almost 45 days after the implementation of gst, announced that gst will not be imposed on prepaid reloads but will be based on usage, which would result in lower usage from subscribers. when contacted, an analyst from hlib research told the edge financial daily that despite the downside, telcos might be able to see some relief in 3q2015, during the hari raya celebration and the school holidays. moreover, the 3q and 4q are traditionally the better quarters for telcos. alliancedbs

sure we raised a lot more than this issue. (we) hope to get more clarification on this issue, shahril said. shahril was speaking to the media after sitting as a panelist in a bursa malaysia-organised discussion on value proposition for environment, sustainability and governance investment. he was commenting on fgvs proposal to buy a 37% stake in pt eagle high from controlling shareholder rajawali corp for about us$680 million (rm2.55 billion). the purchase consideration would be settled by us$632 million cash, plus issue of 95 million new fgv shares.\nthe proposal has sent fgv's share price to a record low of rm1.65 on monday. the stock closed at rm1.68 on wednesday. in addition, fgv (valuation: 2; fundamental: 1.15) proposed to also buy an equity interest of between 93.3% and 95% in rajawalis sugar project for us$67 million (rm251.3 million). when asked if epf would review its 5% shareholding in fgv, particularly at a time when the share price has been performing poorly, he instead replied that the provident fund has pulled out of several companies in the past. shahril pointed out that epf has already reduced its stake in fgv to 5%, from about 10% at its peak, following the listing exercise in 2012. maxis bhd, the country's largest mobile operator by subscribers, has proposed to set up a rm5 billion islamic bond (sukuk) programme, with proceeds used for its capital expenditure and working capital and to refinance other debts. in a filing with bursa malaysia, maxis said the securities commission malaysia (sc) has, vide its letter today, given its approval for the unrated sukuk programme, which will have a tenure of up to 30 years. cimb investment bank bhd has been appointed as the sole principal adviser and lead arranger for the sukuk programme. the yield to maturity will be determined prior to each issuance of sukuk, and the sukuk will be redeemed by the issuer at 100% of their nominal value on their respective maturity dates, maxis said.  seven directors, including managing director datuk chng kong san, saw themselves removed from the board of scanwolf corp bhd this afternoon, following the conclusion of its extraordinary general meeting (egm). scanwolf co-founder and substantial shareholder datuk tan sin keat, who was the only board member to turn up at today's meeting, managed to retain his seat as executive director. meanwhile, five new candidates, who were nominated by three substantial shareholders of scanwolf (fundamental: 0.55;

as well as a commercial project in sydney, australia, will be injected into ewi.  meanwhile, eco world development group bhd reported a 286% jump in net profit to rm11.81 million in the second quarter, from rm3.06 million in the preceding first quarter. revenue rose to rm417.82 million from rm158.03 million. as eco world (fundamental: 0.5; valuation: 0) has changed its financial year from september 30 to october 31, there were no comparative figures from a year earlier. however, eco worlds income statement had provided on-year comparative figures for the quarter ended march 31, as a reference. according to the income statement, net profit for the quarter fell to rm2.57 million, from rm6.67 million a year earlier. revenue fell to rm26.85 million, from rm33.54 million. eco world attributed the weaker financials to lower sales and revenue recognition from the groups existing developments. the firm also said it did not actively launch any sizeable new tracks at its kota masai project in johor, as the developer was reviewing its master plan, which intends to create two separate and complementary developments adjacent to one another. a shareholder of lysaght galvanized steel bhd has filed an application in the kuala lumpur high court to adjourn the companys 36th annual general meeting (agm) scheduled for next monday (june 22). in a filing with bursa malaysia, lysaght (fundamental: 1.95; valuation: 2.4) said shareholder chan sum yoon had filed the application on various reasons, including the purported short notice of the agm and notice of nomination for the election of directors. lysaght said its legal counsel will be filing a memorandum of appearance to act as solicitors for the company, and will be submitting an application to the high court on thursday (june 18), to convert chans application into an opposed ex-parte application and vindicate the companys rights. in a separate filing, lysaght revealed chan had nominated chua tia bon, board member of holding company lysaght (malaysia) sdn bhd, for director positions at the upcoming agm. in an explanatory letter filed with bursa malaysia today, lysaght also said another shareholder, karin leong wai feung, had nominated ee beng guan, former head of legal department at lion group, for the position as well.

why it bought a 37% stake in pt eagle high plantations (ehp) for us$680 million (rm2.55 billion) in cash and stocks. fghv bought the stake from the indonesian-based rajawali group. the purchase was viewed as negative by cimb, ong said, as fgvh had paid rp775 per share while ehps last closing price was rp450 per share. the acquisition would not give fgvh a controlling stake in ehp. \"the acquisition would dilute fgvhs net profit in financial year 2016 by 10%, the net gearing ratio of fgvh will rise from 1.05x to 1.43x and the cash flow of fgvh will be negatively impacted, ong said in

itself to the public since the employees provident fund (epf), retirement fund inc (kwap) and pilgrims fund tabung haji also owned shares in fgv. will the board and management take responsibility for the negative perception from the market which has led to the continued decline in fgvs share price? last month, fgvh officials told the star that low crude palm oil (cpo) prices worldwide and severe floods late last year had affected oil palm production badly and depressed earnings. these factors were the reason for the fall in the companys share prices, its lowest since the company debuted on the stock market in june 2012. a felda settler group said that the fall in prices had hurt more than 94,000 settlers who bought shares in fgvh and who now pay rm50 a month to service loans taken to buy those shares. ong questioned fgvhs reasons for its dismal performance, saying that fgvh shares had fared the worst among other local plantation companies. as of june 12, the stock price of fgv had

"analysts differ over impact of high may 2015 inventory on cpo prices", "article": " kuala lumpur (june 11): analysts are split over the effect of the increase in palm oil inventory for may 2015 on near-term crude palm oil (cpo) prices. cimb investment bank bhd analyst ivy ng said in a report today that the increase in palm oil stocks could dampen cpo prices, as stocks are expected to rise further in june, driven by seasonally higher cpo output. she said the impact on cpo prices could be offset by a significant increase in demand, the projected el nino phenomenons adverse effects on production and indonesias plan to raise their biodiesel usage by implementing a cpo levy on planters. palm oil stocks in malaysia rose 3% month-on-month (m-o-m) and 22% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 2.24 million tonnes at end-may, she said. this came as a negative surprise to us and the market, as the inventory is 8% above our estimate and 5% to 6% higher than consensus numbers, she said. the higher-than-expected malaysian palm oil stocks were due to a combination of stronger-than-expected output and weaker-than-expected exports, she added. ng said that cpo prices had risen over the past two weeks due to expectations that the stronger demand for palm oil will help to reduce the inventory level in the country. she also said the warning from bmw group malaysia that the b10 biodiesel, which malaysia plans to implement by october this year, could cause severe damage to its engines is a near-term negative for cpo price. ng said the research firm projects cpo price will range from rm2,000 to rm2,500 per tonne in june and advised investors to be selective in their stock picks. on the other hand, hong leong investment bank analyst chye wen fei said the increase of palm oil stocks in may this year is unlikely to dampen cpo prices significantly as the weak ringgit and the recent surge in soybean oil price have boosted the competitiveness of palm oil. the australian bureau of meteorology indicated that el nino will likely be a severe event and the implementation of b10 biodiesel programme in malaysia by october 2015 will boost palm oil consumption by 300k tonnes per year,\" she said. chye said exports surged by 37.3% m-o-m to 1.61 million tonnes in may 2015, boosted mainly by sharply higher exports to china (an increase of 36.9%), india (an increase of 292.3%) and netherlands (an increase of 211%). we believe the sharp increase in exports were due to a combination of factors including: low inventory level in india; normalising restocking activities in india; and weaker ringgit (against the us$), which has in turn boosted palms improved price competitiveness, she added. she said the research firm has maintained its average cpo price assumptions of rm2,300 per tonne and rm2,400 per tonne for 2015 and 2016. affin hwang investment bank bhd analyst ong keng wee said higher imports, which increased 55.5% m-o-m, an increase of 99.4% y-o-y, likely ahead of the proposed indonesian export levy, unexpectedly pushed inventory slightly higher to 2.24 million tonnes in may. he said a survey by cargo surveyer intertek testing services showed that exports increased by just 2.2% m-o-m in the first 10 days of june. the research firm maintained its cpo average selling price (asp) assumptions of rm2,320 per tonne for 2015 estimate (compared to the year to date average of rm2,238 per tonne) and rm2,500 per tonne for 2016 and 2017 estimates. the performance of plantation stocks was mixed this morning. sime darby bhd rose one sen or 0.12% to

valuation: 3) has made no secret of the fact that it wants to become a full-fledged islamic bank, and that its preferred method of doing so is by merging with an existing islamic financial institution. the move to raise funds now, ahmad zaini says, is all about gearing up towards eventual discussion, at some point in time, for a corporate exercise that may come on board. were just getting ourselves ready for that. news reports of late speculate that mbsb has been looking at kuwait finance house (m) bhd (kfhm) as a potential merger target. kfhms middle eastern parent company, kuwait finance house, said it might sell some of its investments, including kfhm, and picked credit suisse to advise it on the matter, reuters reported on may 5. ahmad zaini admits that mbsb has been approached to look at kfhm. but, he indicates that kfhm may not be the most suitable merger partner for it. lets put it this way  when you talk about m&a, therell be many proposals that come to you. [but] if you look at it from a logic point of view, we need to have more of a commercial [banking] platform rather than an investment banking platform  and i think kfhm is more of an investment banking platform. mbsb, in which the employees provident fund (epf) has a 64% stake, is understood to be more keen on bank islam malaysia bhd as a merger partner. bank islam, the countrys first standalone islamic bank, is controlled by lembaga tabung haji but the epf also has a 10.17% stake in it. ahmad zaini says he does not discount the possibility of a merger with bank islam. at the shareholders level, i think they may have had some discussion, he says, adding however that this is all exploratory for now and that there have been no formal talks between the parties. it was just in january this year that a proposed mega merger of mbsb, cimb group holdings bhd and rhb capital bhd was aborted after six months of talks because economic conditions had turned less favourable. but ahmad zaini remains keen for mbsb to do some kind of m&a exercise that would give it a banking platform, and says this is one of the groups main focus for this year. the industry is becoming increasingly competitive, and for a non-bank financial institution like mbsb to compete effectively with banking rivals, it needs to move out of its current no mans land and onto a banking platform, he explains. in its efforts to close the gap to become more like a bank, it started, as of the fourth quarter of last year, adopting the more stringent loan loss provisioning standards that banks do. ahmad zaini says mbsb conveyed to analysts as early as the third quarter of last year that it would embark on a two-year loan impairment programme. last year, the group moved towards the industrys non-performing loan (npl) classification of three months in arrears, from six months in arrears previously. toxic loans? but the more aggressive provisioning stance has taken a toll on mbsbs earnings. on may 7, mbsb announced a 36.8% drop in net profit for the first quarter of its financial year ending dec 31, 2015 (fy2015), to rm124.3 million. this was mainly because it had a higher loan loss provision of rm101.3 million, compared with just rm15.2 million in the same quarter a year ago. the provisioning amount was pretty similar to the rm100.1 million that was provided in the fourth quarter of fy2014. but in that fourth quarter, mbsb had still managed to show strong net profit growth of 194% due to the recognition of rm366.06 million in deferred tax assets. mbsbs 1qfy2015 net profit fell below analysts expectations, coming in at just 20% of a consensus forecast for the full year. revenue however held up, growing 3.5% to rm690.6 million. after six straight years of record annual profits, the less-than-stellar start to fy2015 made investors nervous. analysts slashed their annual earnings forecast for mbsb for fy2015 and fy2016 on expectations of elevated credit cost over that period. mbsbs share price has fallen 5.5% since the results were announced, to rm1.90 as at last thursday, its lowest close in just over two years. ahmad zaini however says the impairment programme is a necessary sacrifice that needs to be made to put the group on a stronger footing over the long term. we need to move our processes  and one of that is impairment  towards a banking platform. and our objective has always been that we need to move toward a loan loss coverage (llc) of 100%. we are now at 78.5% (as at end-march). the industry is about 98% to 100%. so what do we do ... ignore that? thats the reason why were saying we need to accelerate the impairment programme towards achieving the llc of about 100% within the next two years  we think thats a reasonable period. and of course, when you do that, it will affect your earnings, your returns and things like that. but these are sacrifices that need to be made in order for us to be on a better, stronger footing later on. he says the size of provisions in the coming quarters will likely be in the same range as the last two quarters. it should be. there should not be any sudden jump on the impaired value. ahmad zaini is indignant about an analyst research report recently that suggested mbsb had hidden toxic assets and that the impairment programme would help clear up the groups npls which had been sitting in the groups books for the last six years. the groups solid growth over the last few years had in a large part been due to the sizzling growth in its personal financing (pf) business to civil servants, which accounts for about 70% of its total loan portfolio. civil servants service these loans through monthly automatic salary deduction. ive said this many times  how can the pf portfolio be toxic when weve got salary deduction at source? it can only be problematic if people resign from the government service, as then theyll stop paying us  that is the major cause of npls. but obviously, we have our ways of following-up and collecting. the other reason for npls is when they (civil servants) face disciplinary action when working, so their payroll may be cut in half or something, but that is not [that common]. theres also death, but then their insurance will eventually sort us out. he says the groups retail loans, which include mortgages and automotive financing to the private sector, is where mbsb is carrying out its impairment programme. parts of it is the old mortgage portfolio and parts of it is pf. but the pf portfolio is stable. corporate loans, weve very clean, apart from one legacy loan thats now under legal [process], he says. ahmad zaini insists that mbsb is fundamentally strong, with a secure business model. none of the roughly rm3 billion [were planning to raise] is to cover impairment, if thats what people are thinking. impairment is to be covered through our own operating profit. he says investors however have to prepare for a period of slower growth as the group bites the bullet over these two years. mbsb is maintaining its target of 8% revenue growth in fy2015, after 3% growth last year, but expects that showing profit growth this year will be very difficult. he expects net interest margin to be sustained at around 3.5% this year, obviously, investors, because mbsb has been doing so well the last six years, they think the party will still go on and on. if we dont have this provisioning policy and just adopt our existing policy, yes we will show the growth. but where will it end? if youre looking at mbsb on a longer footing, you have to do something. and the longer-term footing means a banking footing, which means you need to do all these things [like impairment]. these are the costs to comply. its always going to be there. he says the group should be able to have more business growth once it is on a proper banking platform. well be able to have more product range, a bigger ability to do more things, lower our funding costs and all that. right now, were just spreading ourselves thin. we just have to push more towards corporate loans, which we are already doing, he says. the upside for the group in these two years could come from loan recoveries through its more aggressive collection strategies. a lot of our forecasts have not taken into account collection, so if we do that well, were going to get good recovery. the groups gross npl ratio was broadly stable in the first quarter, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, at 6.2%. ahmad zaini expects the net npl ratio to come in at around 4% this year, from 4.1% last year. mbsb closed at rm1.93 last friday for a market capitalisation of rm5.16 billion. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated

seong, deputy ceo ho meng and executive director tan u ming were also present. it started with a presentation by the ceo who talked about the drivers of the stronger 1q results and the groups growth strategies. key takeaways were the bulk of the same-store-sales growth was driven by the selling price hike in the previous year. it is on track to achieve its targets of 200 net new stores and store refurbishment per year.  also, more in-store services will be launched, and the group is still evaluating its plan to build its own combined distribution centre; it is monitoring product demand and the change of product mix more closely first. there were no major surprises. aside from its distribution centre project, other plans set during the ipo are generally progressing well. although 1q met only 20% of our full-year forecast, we deem it to be in line as we expect the new stores opened in 1q to start contributing more significantly in the next few quarters. we also expect the recovery from the east coast floods to help boost results. while the overall retail market could be soft in 2q, we expect 7-eleven to perform better than the industry given that it sells mainly small and inexpensive items. hence, it is less likely to be significantly affected by the slower consumer spending. in fact, it has been able to perform above the industry average since listing. stay on the sidelines. although its performance has been encouraging and it appears on track to achieve its targets we think this has been priced in. we believe that 7-eleven is fairly valued for now.  cimb

year-on-year while net profit growth was a higher 34.6%. higher profit growth was mainly due to greater economies of scale and contribution from its high profit margin online voluntary vehicle

myegs rm35 (rm3 discount to the earlier fee of rm38) per fwpr transaction. other than the rm35 fwpr fee, myeg gets an additional rm65 commission for being an independent insurance agent selling

" the exclusive distributorship of red bull clinched by yee lee corp bhd, which edged out beverage giant fraser & neave holdings bhd (f&n), looks set to lift the earnings of the mid-cap ipoh-based company in its financial year ending dec 31, 2016 (fy2016). the distribution right from principal allexcel trading sdn bhd provides yee lee (fundamental: 1; valuation: 0.8) with the sole right to distribute three main red bull energy drinks, namely red bull less sugar, red bull gold in cans and red bull bottle, for a five-year period beginning aug 1. yee lee will be responsible for marketing, distributing and selling the three types of red bull energy drinks, taking over f&ns (fundamental: 2.1; valuation: 1.1) previous role. f&n could not agree on the commercial terms with allexcel and decided to forgo the exclusive distributorship. it is noteworthy that yee lee had been a distributor of the imported red bull international energy drinks under red bull asia fze since 2010, which are sold in tall and slim blue cans, but the parties agreed to terminate the contract prior to the announcement of yee lees exclusive distributorship from allexcel. the termination of the red bull asia fze contract is not expected to have any material impact on the companys earnings for fy2015, yee lee says in a recent announcement. currently, more than four million cartons of red bull energy drinks are sold yearly in malaysia, allexcel says in an email reply to the edge. this is twice the amount  two million cartons  sold in 2010 when f&n first signed on as the exclusive distributor for allexcel. based on the latest ac nielsen retail audit in march 2015, red bull has a dominant market share of over 50% in the energy drinks category in pan malaysia, says allexcel. the bulk of the red bull energy drinks sold is red bull gold in cans. to give some insight into how this exclusive distributorship could enhance yee lees revenue, f&n ceo lim yew hoe told reporters during f&ns first half financial result briefing last week that the red bull business had brought in annual revenue of between rm200 million and rm250 million for the company. this would make up about 30% of yee lees full-year revenue of rm690.45 million for fy2014. yee lee declined to comment on the potential returns from the distribution right when contacted by the edge. in a report by cimb research on f&n dated march 29, the research house says the red bull business could contribute to more than 5% of f&ns net profits given its good margins. while a 5% net profit contribution for heavyweight f&n may be insignificant, its impact on yee lee could prove more meaningful. f&ns annualised full-year profit for its financial year ending sept 30, 2015, works out to rm280.85 million, calculated based on its cumulative six-months net profit of rm140.4 million. assuming that the red bull business contributed 5% to f&ns net profits, it means that yee lee could stand to gain about rm14 million from the exclusive distributorship, making up half of yee lees net profits of rm27.01 million for fy2014. this exclusive distributorship could be timely for the integrated manufacturer and distributor, which saw its net profits dip 19.5% year on year to rm27.01 million in fy2014. the slide in net profits came despite the higher revenue it achieved for the year. net profits were hit by the weaker performance of its manufacturing division, which saw lower sales for its aerosol cans and palm kernels, while its trading division incurred advertising expenses that offset the increase in revenue which the division achieved during the year. in fy2014, the company shifted its aerosol can factory to vietnam, which also impacted the manufacturing divisions profits. yee lee started off as an edible oil repacker but has now diversified into manufacturing aerosol cans as well as operating oil palm and tea plantations, and palm oil refineries that manufacture edible oils. it also markets and distributes fast-moving consumer goods. in addition, it owns sabah tea resort. as at dec 31, 2014, the company had a net gearing of 0.18 times with total borrowings of rm113.48 million and cash balance of rm49.95 million. it is worth noting that yee lee has a 32.76% stake in spritzer bhd, which contributed rm7.58 million to its profits in fy2014. since late december 2014, yee lees share price has been on an upward trend. it climbed to a record high of rm2.24 on april 13 before losing its upward momentum. at last thursdays close of rm2, the counter was trading at a forward

"lead story: construction stocks major beneficiary of 11mp", "article": "  the 11th malaysia plan (11mp) 2016-2020 tabled last thursday by prime minister najib razak sets the final course toward vision 2020, but so far it has not injected any enthusiasm on the local bourse. the benchmark fbm klci slipped to an intra-day low of 1,793.34 points last thursday  a two-month low  before closing below the psychological 1,800 point mark at 1,795.04 points (down 0.83% or 15.07 points). the local bellwether ended the week lower at 1.787.50 points. that said, for stocks on bursa malaysia, infrastructure development seems to be the key theme that will have a spillover effect, especially for construction counters. the construction sector seems poised to be the main beneficiary of the 11mp, with the higher development expenditure allocation for the next five years of rm260 billion versus the rm230 billion allocated in the 10mp, eastspring investments bhds head of research lilian see tells the edge. about half of the allocation has been pegged for infrastructure development (see table for key projects). another 30% will go towards social matters like education and healthcare, while the remaining will be spent on safety and general administration. the following are top picks of fund managers and analysts based on the 11mp sectoral themes. gamuda bhd if analysts are clear about one thing, it is that gamuda bhd is a clear beneficiary of the klang valley mass rapid transit (mrt) line 2 as it is the project delivery partner (pdp), alongside joint venture partner mmc corp bhd. they say gamuda is a frontrunner for the tunnelling works worth rm10 billion, owing to its solid track record with mrt line 1, which is slated for completion in july 2022. the rm8 billion gemas-jb rail double-tracking and rm25 billion mrt line 2 are positives for gamuda as the group is likely to be the main winner given its track record in completing the rm12 billion ipoh-padang besar double-tracking project and the rm23 billion mrt line 1. what is unclear for now is the revised timeline and funding for the gemas-jb rail job, says cimb researchs sharizan rosely. gamuda-mmc has also bid to be the pdp at light rapid transit (lrt) line 3, which should be awarded this july. cimb research has an add call on gamuda with a target price of rm6.20, a 22.5% upside from last fridays closing price of rm5.06. ijm corp bhd ijm corp is considered a frontrunner for major infrastructure jobs under the 11mp. it is the potential winner of the rm25 billion mrt line 2 (above-ground packages) and rm9 billion lrt line 3 projects, among others. ijm corp is a top pick for etiqa insurance & takafuls head of research chris eng. ijm corp would be the largest beneficiary of the west coast expressway. it has been appointed to undertake rm2.8 billion of the works, with the remaining rm2.2 billion to be tendered out, says hlib researchs jeremy goh. he recommends a buy on ijm corp with a target price of rm7.92, indicating an 11.5% upside from last fridays close of rm7.10. cahya mata sarawak bhd cahya mata sarawak (cms) is expected to be a beneficiary of the 11mp development expenditure allocated for the east malaysian infrastructure sector, in particular the pan-borneo highway, says uob kayhian research analyst vincent khoo. the conglomerate is well-placed to bag such jobs based on its track record in the state, where it has multiple maintenance concessions for federal roads (some 680km) and state roads (5,400km). cms is in a strong position to secure some packages [from the rm27 billion pan borneo highway project] and will boost its building-material products [division] as well, says midf researchs head of equity research syed muhammed kifni. cms, which deals primarily in cement, construction materials and road maintenance, has in recent times also been a favoured proxy to the sarawak corridor of renewable energy, and its road concessions bring in steady income streams. note that some 40% of the companys equity is held by the family of former sarawak chief minister tun abdul taib mahmud. uob kayhian has a buy call on the stock at a target price of rm5.37, indicating a 0.75% upside from fridays closing price of rm5.33.    hock seng lee bhd analysts concur that another potential beneficiary of the pan borneo highway is hock seng lee (hsl). while not exclusively mentioned, we expect some jobs to come out from the sarawak portion of the rm27 billion pan borneo highway; home-grown hock seng lee is a potential beneficiary, says amresearch analyst mak hoy ken. hong leong investment bank research (hlib research) analyst jeremy goh says that the sarawak-based contractor has a decent chance of participating in the project. hsl had a clean balance sheet with no debts and rm85 million in cash as at end-march. note that the group secured rm105 million worth of new projects in the first quarter and could be the choice contractor for the remaining phases of the kuching central sewerage system worth rm3.5 billion, having already completed the first phase of rm452 million. its order book stands at rm1.5 billion in hand, with rm870 million outstanding. amresearch has a buy call on the stock with a fair value of rm2.30, indicating a 17.9% upside from last fridays close of rm1.95. sasbadi holdings bhd most of the 11mp education initiatives did not run far from that already highlighted in the malaysian education blueprint 2015-2025. the government will continue to reinforce stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education through enquiry-based and hands-on learning opportunities. we believe the potential beneficiary of the [11mp] measures above would be sasbadi, says hlib research mardhiah omar. sasbadi is well-poised as it is setting up its first learning centre in kota damansara, which will emphasise on stem education. the centre is expected to open in the second half of 2015. also, sasbadis existing online platform is in accordance with government initiatives aimed specifically at promoting the use of online educational resources to complement conventional classroom teaching, she says. hlib research has a buy call on the stock with a target price of rm2.72, indicating a 26.5% upside from last fridays closing price of rm2.15.   note: the edge researchs fundamental score

unit to help reduce gearing", "article": " kuala lumpur: eastern & oriental bhds (e&o) proposed listing of its uk-based subsidiary, eastern & oriental property (uk) ltd, on the london stock exchange by year-end will help the developer to reduce its gearing level, said analysts. an e&o spokesman told the edge financial daily that the initial public offering (ipo) of e&o uk is expected to be completed sometime within the year, but declined to comment further as the proposal is still in the preliminary stages. at this point ... its a bit premature. we are still putting together the proposal and we cannot disclose the details yet. we will need at least a month ... to put together the proposal. the listing will be in 2015. last monday, in an announcement dated may 25, e&o (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.4) revealed its proposal to list the entire securities of e&o uk, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the group, on the alternative investment market (aim) of the london stock exchange. the group said the listing will support its expansion in the united kingdom, as it is expected to enhance the visibility of its property development and investment activities in the uk, and expects its gearing to improve, following the de-consolidation of e&o uk and its subsidiaries. through the proposed ipo, the e&o uk group will be able to strengthen its financial position and raise funds for the redevelopment of its real estate assets in london, namely esca house, landmark house and thames tower into residential and mixed-use developments, subject to obtaining ... planning consent, said the group. e&o will issue one warrant per share of e&o uk, following the successful listing of its subsidiary. a property analyst with midf research viewed the development positively, as the listing will reduce the groups net gearing, noting that the groups cash level has declined, while total liabilities rose as at march 31. we are positive on the news as this will reduce e&os net gearing, which is currently at 0.60 times, to a more healthy level of below 0.35 times post ipo, he told the edge financial daily. he said there are two ways e&o can reduce its gearing level through the ipo: (i) through the cash proceeds from the listing exercise and (ii) through the de-consolidation of its stake in e&o uk. de-consolidation means that e&o will eventually own less than 50% of the listed entity. as a result, e&o will no longer be required to consolidate e&o uks debt at the group level. hence, this will result in lower net gearing, he said. for the fourth quarter ended march (4qfy15), its cash and balances stood at rm199.63 million, compared with rm277.17 million as at end-4qfy14. its total liabilities increased to rm1.42 billion as at end-march 2015, from rm956.55 million as at end-march 2014. although this is a concern in the short term, management has already taken proactive action to pare down its net gearing via the ipo of its uk subsidiary, said the analyst. however, he added that it is still too early to say whether midf will revise its neutral rating on e&o based on the news of the ipo itself, as the research house is also looking at earnings delivery, valuation and the general sentiment towards the property industry. terence wong, analyst with cimb investment bank bhd, views the proposed listing positively and said e&o will sell down its stake to below 50% for the ipo, thus reducing the groups gearing ratio. he noted that the group has already appointed an acting chief executive officer (ceo) to head the uk operations, as well as four or five staff members who will manage the uk business separately from e&o. however, he does not expect e&o to record any gains from the exercise, as any revaluation of the groups properties will likely be offset by its listing expenses. e&o closed three sen or 1.7% higher at rm1.83, giving a market capitalisation of rm2.20 billion. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects

nino, malaysian oil palm planters said they are not yet certain that the weather phenomenon will develop here this year as the australian bureau of meteorology is forecasting a moderate-to-strong event coming our way. i have not given it (el nino) much thought. we have been playing the el nino charade for the past two years. who knows if this el nino is another one that is crying wolf? sarawak oil palms bhd chief operating officer eric kiu kwong seng told the edge financial daily. last year, everyone spoke about el nino. i think it was taken more seriously at that point because there was also a water shortage issue in selangor.  it was very dry and our palm oil production was lower by 5% to 10% than our projections. this year, we are not seeing the same sense of urgency, kiu added. kim loong resources bhd managing director gooi seong lim is also unperturbed by news of the next el nino, relegating the matter to next years problem. i have not seen any signs of el nino so far. if it comes, it will be next years problem and there is nothing you can do to stop it, gooi told the edge financial daily. but we will look into it with greater detail towards the end of this year, he added. however, th plantations bhd chief executive officer datuk zainal azwar zainal aminuddin feels that the el nino phenomenon is not to be taken lightly as it affects crop production in the immediate, medium and longer terms. both malaysia and indonesia, the worlds two largest producers of crude palm oil (cpo), lie within the equatorial pacific region, the region most prone to the effects of el nino should it recur, said zainal. [el nino] will lead to a marked decrease in production yields, possibly up to a 20% to 30% impact on fresh fruit bunch yields in severe episodes of drought, and concurrent decrease in oil extraction rates. even after one-and-a-half to two years later, the impact would still be apparent and oil palm plantations that are in their prime mature may be most affected, he said. planters overwhelmingly agree that an el nino will give the current depressed cpo market a much needed push, but this will come at the expense of lower production yields. at the current cpo price level and the high inventory we are seeing, i think that cpo price could come under more pressure and go as low as rm2,000 per tonne. in that sense, el nino is positive for prices even if it means production levels are lower, gooi said. zainal estimates that cpo could trade within the range of rm2,300 to rm2,400 per tonne should el nino materialise, but a surge in price would not happen immediately. we do not discount the possibility of a price rally in the later part of the year, spilling onto next year, once the effects of el nino are felt. we also expect the prices of soy, sunflower, rapeseed and other competing vegetable oils to be positively affected, he said. history, too, supports this school of thought. according to a note issued by publicinvest research, cpo price rose 22% during an 11-month weak-to-moderate el nino back in 2009. further back, an eight-month long weak occurrence boosted the cpo price by 39.1% in 2006, while a 10-month moderate-to-strong el nino run in 2003 caused the cpo price to spike 40.6%. still, analysts are of the view that it is too soon to forecast how much planters would stand to benefit from a higher cpo price as a result of the el nino event or how the cpo price will react. cimb research plantation analyst ivy ng, who has a neutral call on the sector, said she has yet to review her cpo price forecast to take into consideration the el nino effect. it is difficult to forecast what kind of earnings impact an el nino will have on planters at this point because we cannot predict the weather. different planters have different exposure in different sites in different parts of the world. the el nino has been classified as high probability, but has not reached its peak. so, we prefer to be conservative and only factor that into our earnings projections when we see it devolving, ng said. the impact of the el nino on cpo price itself will depend on the severity of the weather and stock buffer at that point. as it stands, there is some stock buffer [from high inventory]. if el nino is a minor event, the impact of cpo price will be minimal. if it is a major event, then we will see huge volatility in cpo prices, she explained. plantation companies have seen their earnings fall in the quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1q15) on depressed cpo prices. felda global ventures holdings bhd, the worlds largest palm oil producer, saw its net profit plummet 97% to only rm3.58 million in 1q15. for 1q15, sarawak oil palms (fundamental: 1; valuation: 0.8) reported a 83.8% drop in net profit to rm5.45 million, while kim loong (fundamental: 2.8; valuation:

going to do yourself harm. we believe that things will start to slow, he tells the edge in an exclusive interview. this year, a lot of our focus really is on getting more efficiencies in productivity, in people, in our cost and capital base. part of this led to the reorganisation. it is a reorganisation that tries to address, frankly, multiple things at the same time and underlying it all, we believe that it will create additional shareholder value. despite the tougher operating environment, kam stresses that rhb caps ignite 2017 transformation vision is very much on track. the one major outcome that i have guided to the market that will change is how aggressive we will be in overseas expansion, he says, adding that the target for overseas contribution by 2017 will be revised to 20%, rather than 30%, of group revenue. the focus [on expanding overseas] will be on a less capital-intensive route. there is a possibility that the investment bank will be used to spearhead that. a regional network makes the most sense for our investment banking platform to capitalise on flows. in our mind, it doesnt make sense to push for 30% in the current environment, kam says, adding that the two missing markets are indonesia and the philippines (see q&a on page 64). on the reorganisation, kam says the recent changes in the industry and the regulations  such as consolidated capital ratios under the new financial services act 2013  have made the current structure of the group inefficient. thus, the group is undertaking an internal restructuring and a rights issue that will result in the banking business  rhb bank bhd  taking over the listing status of rhb cap. the proposed rights issue of new shares is expected to raise up to rm2.5 billion. following this, the group is expected to see interest savings of rm150 million and tax savings of rm35 million to rm40 million. all of the earnings uplift will be on a smaller book value, resulting in an increase in return on equity (roe). the groups common equity tier 1 (cet1) ratio is expected to increase to at least 11% from the current 9% while earnings per share is expected to be diluted by between 10% and 30%. credit suisse research expects roe to improve to 12.1% to 14.3% versus 10.8% to 12.2% under the current holding company structure. firstly, we are moving the efficiencies up. secondly, the holding company discount has been removed, so we bring our shareholders directly into the banking group. and thirdly, there are efficiencies because of a better credit rating. holding companies are always rated differently from the actual operating companies. in our case, the bank is rated aa and the holding company an a  one notch down. with the reorganisation, the actual borrowing and expansion vehicle is an aa company. its a much stronger company. so, when it comes to borrowing and expansion, you [will] see all these savings, kam explains. and when we raise rm2.5 billion, the book value of the new listed entity is actually lower because we have eliminated part of the goodwill that sits at rhb cap. most rights issues will see a dilution in roe because the shareholders funds go up and roe goes down. but in our case, because of how it is structured, the roe goes up. this, kam says, is why a re-rating of the new listed entitys stock makes sense. if you think about it, it has stronger roe than the preceding company. it is a stronger credit-rated company and there is no holding company, so you are directly sitting with the bank operating company itself. so, if you look at it from all perspectives, from the shareholders perspective, it makes perfect sense. from an expansion standpoint, to have a bank, as opposed to a holding company, spearhead the expansion as we go out into the region also makes perfect sense.  rhb cap  a takeover target rhb cap was the result of a merger of banks that included kwong yik bank bhd, dcb bank bhd, sime bank bhd and utama banking group. it was a takeover target because of its vulnerability then  it was left with heavy debts and had to be restructured after sinking into a sea of red with losses reaching hundreds of million ringgit during the 1997/98 asian financial crisis. the banking group has been restructured and strengthened since 2007, when the employees provident fund (epf) emerged as the single largest shareholder of rhb cap after winning a bidding war. it beat rival buyers eon capital bhd and a kuwait finance house-led consortium. the retirement funds rm2.25 billion cash offer to raise its holding in the rhb group later resulted in a couple of corporate exercises as it had to pare down its 82% stake. as a result, the epf sold a 25% stake to abu dhabi commercial bank in 2008. this stake was later sold to aabar investments pjsc. the epf has a 41.3% stake in rhb cap today while aabar holds 21.4% and osk holdings bhd 9.9%. in recent years, rhb cap has seen a couple of attempted takeovers  by malayan banking bhd and cimb group holdings bhd in 2011 and by cimb again last year. rhb cap itself went on an acquisition drive, buying osk investment bank for rm1.95 billion in 2012. this gave it the regional platform it was looking for. rhb cap gained immediate access to the equity, investment banking and fund management businesses in singapore, hong kong, china, thailand and indonesia. on top of that, it has equity and investment banking operations as well as a full-fledged commercial bank in cambodia. since its restructuring in 2007 and the slew of corporate exercises, the fourth largest local banking group has been steadily strengthening its position, as indicated by its improved earnings performance. from a net profit of rm316 million in fy2005, rhb cap saw its bottom line increase to rm2.04 billion in fy2014. its asset base of rm89.9 billion in 2005 expanded to rm219.3 billion in 2014. kam, who had joined the group 13 years ago, has seen at least three takeover attempts and a couple of restructuring and merger exercises. rhb is probably one of the [few] companies that have seen so many major events in that span of time in corporate malaysia. some companies go through big events and dont survive  they end up being taken over or bailed out. now, rhb has gone through crisis after crisis after crisis. and because of that, the team and some board members who have been through it all with us have a strong bond, he says, adding that the events did not only affect the top people but everyone in the group. in a way, weve gone through a lot, with five to six major events in the space of seven to eight years. thats an event every 1u00bd years. we engage with the team. we want to have this shared vision and passion to make the company better and better. the one thing we pride ourselves on is that the senior team believes in this shared ambition and passion and the growth of the group [as well] u2026 [it is] not just spearheaded at the senior level. we are open to talking to anyone in the group. kam proudly adds that the groups performance has not dipped despite the takeover attempts, which can be distracting. we have had an unbroken profit growth track record for the last 10 years in spite of what has been happening. sometimes, people dont give the group enough credit because they compare us with companies that are on a steady path, those that did not have to worry about [takeover attempts]. for rhb, it is always about consistency. an analyst with a local bank-backed research house says rhb cap has done well despite the distractions and changes in top management over the years. they should continue to do well this year. they were without a full management team over the past years but were still able to generate results, which picked up momentum when they got a full team on board at the end of 2013. despite the merger distraction last year and given the fact that the ignite 2017 strategy  which provides greater focus for the group  was just introduced in the first quarter of 2014, the group has done pretty well. they also introduced the connect strategy last august, which is aimed at motivating and empowering internal personnel, especially at the branch level. productivity levels have improved because of it, he says. another banking analyst with a foreign bank says he thinks that operationally, things are going well for the group. they seem to be gaining market share despite the distractions. the team seems to be working quite well together. on the investment banking side, the merger with osk seems to have worked out quite well. the group did very well last year u2026 they have been gaining market share in loans and deposits. the only area where there is concern is margins u2026 they need to try and control the drop. their margins are a little bit lower than the industry average and that is why they are focusing on the small and medium enterprise side. kam shares that the groups strategies have always been premised on laying the foundations for future growth as well as building a strong team and a solid succession plan. the team is very much intact [to ensure a smooth transition], he says, referencing his exit from the group on may 4. i literally grew up here, reflects kam. thirteen years. some people work longer in organisations but i literally grew up here. the people who brought me in gave me the opportunities. it wouldnt be for any other reason than the fact that i think at this stage, it deserves a better person than me, from the standpoint that i am feeling tired. that is what i told the board. if i could still progress at the pace that i believe the company needs, i would stay. but i believe we have built a very strong team. we have a fantastic roadmap. and i always say that when my team is moving faster than i am, then i need to let the team move ahead.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on april 27 - may 3, 2015.

closed at 1,795.04 yesterday, down 15.07 points from the previous day as blue chip stocks like axiata group bhd, cimb group holdings, digi.com bhd, ihh healthcare bhd and sapurakencana petroleum bhd caused the index to decline on some obvious liquidation activities. the ringgit was a touch weaker against the us dollar at 3.6020 as brent crude oil turned weaker at us$64.70 (rm232.92) per barrel. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (oct 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,837.28 (low), 1,879.62 (high), 1,766.22 (low), 1,858.09 (high), 1,671.82 (low), 1,810.21 (high), 1,706.18 (low), 1,831.41 (high), 1,774.30 (low) and 1,867.53 (high). all the indexs daily signals are negative for now, with its cci, dmi, macd, stochastic and oscillator indicators showing much weaker readings. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at the 1,770, 1,774 and 1,793 levels, while the resistance areas of 1,795, 1,823 and 1,867 will cap any index rebound. the klcis 18 and 40 simple moving averages (sma) depict an emerging downtrend with a dead cross for its daily chart. the recent price bars of the index have just turned below the 50 and 200 sma. as such, the index remains on its downturn from its recent 1,867.53 high in late april. upon a break of the critical intermediate support of 1,795, the index may head towards its next downside targets of 1,780, 1,764 and 1,727. due to the poorer tone for the klci index, we are recommending a chart sell on uem sunrise bhd (uems). looking at the most recent fourth quarter financial year 2014 (4qfy14) result announcement, the group recorded higher revenues compared with the preceding year in the same quarter to rm1.341 billion from rm573.1 million in 4qfy13. gerbang land sales to fastrack iskandar sdn bhd of rm248 million and scope energy sdn bhd of rm522.7 million contributed to the higher revenue. correspondingly, profit before tax was also higher in 4qfy14 compared with 4qfy13. looking at the full 12 months financial year 2014 estimate (12mfy14e) compared with 12mfy13e, profit before tax was lower due to lower margins from land sales despite better revenues generated. however, this was mitigated by higher profits from property development. a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that 20 research houses cover the stock. of the 20 reports, there are six buy, 12 hold and two sell calls on uems. the stock currently trades at a reasonable and low historical price earnings ratio of 11 times. its price-to-book value ratio of 0.83 times indicates that its share price is trading at a discount to its book value while uems has an indicative dividend yield of 2.45%. uemss chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly timeframes are very firmly down. its share price made an obvious plunge since its major weekly wave-2 high of rm3.09 on july 19, 2013. since that high, uems has tumbled to its may 2015 recent low of rm1.16. as prices broke above its recent key critical support levels of rm1.44 and rm1.29, look to sell uems on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short-to-longer term down-trend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, oscillator and stochastic) have issued clear sell signals and now depict firm indications of uemss eventual plunge towards lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm1.16, rm1.29 and rm1.44. we expect uems to witness weaker buying at its support areas of rm0.89, rm1.05 and rm1.14. its downside targets are located at rm0.93, rm0.78 and rm0.44. lee cheng

group holdings bhd  announced its first-ever group-wide mutual separation scheme (mss) last friday in a bid to trim staff costs, which currently makes up a little over half the groups total annual overhead. the group needs to cut cost by about rm400 million per year to hit its targeted cost to income ratio (cir) of 55% for this year. staff costs currently makes up 55% of the groups total costs. the group will also look at other cost cutting measures, such as its procurement and strategic review costs, a source familiar with the matter told the edge financial daily. already, cimb will save about rm200 million a year from the recent cut in ib [investment bank] cost, such as the scaling down of the groups north asia operations and the closure of its australian operations, the source added. the cost savings from the mss exercise remains unknown for now, said the source, as it will depend on how many people take up the scheme and the quantum of their individual packages. some 168 people were laid off after cimb closed down its australian offices and cut jobs in the groups hong kong, taiwan, south korea and india operations earlier this year. this time around, cimb said the mss was on a purely voluntary basis and its second mss in four years, with the last one conducted in 2012 for its commercial bank operations, which saw 1,217 employees taking up the mss offer. this is the first group-wide mss for cimb as well as for cimb niaga, said the source. there are no plans now for mss in other countries [the group is in] as 90% of its staff are from these two countries [malaysia and indonesia], the source added. the edge weekly had written in february that banks are likely to cut jobs this year due to the tougher operating landscape eating into earnings caused by an expected rise in non-performing loans (npls) in the region, coupled with margin compression. commenting on cimbs downsizing, midf research banking analyst kelvin ong told the edge financial daily that the exercise is expected and is part of cimbs t18 (target 2018) plan to drive its cir down. there are basically two parts to cimbs t18 plan. first, it wants to drive revenue up and secondly it is to enhance cost and operating efficiency. the most immediate impact they can make now is to drive costs down and the mss is a part of that. right now it is about getting the right sizing for the business, ong explained. it is no secret that cimb has been plagued with a high cir. for its financial year ended dec 31, 2014 (fy14), its cir climbed to 58.6%  the highest in the industry  from 57.6% in fy13. the t18 plan, which cimb announced on feb 6, outlined a set of initiatives and key organisational changes to achieve a cir ratio of below 50% by end-2018. it also aims to achieve a return on equity (roe) of 15%, common equity tier-one (cet-1) ratio of over 11%, and a 60% consumer banking income contribution by that time. cimb, which was once a high-flyer among local banks, is now one of the weaker performers in the industry. its earnings have been declining in the last three consecutive quarters (1qfy14: rm1.07 billion; 2qfy14: rm949.9 million; 3qfy14: rm890.27 million) and it announced its worst quarterly result in 4qfy14 in terms of roe, which stood at only 0.64%. its net profit was down 81% on-year to rm200.3 million in 4qfy14, mainly due to higher corporate banking loan impairments in indonesia and malaysia, as well as a loss-making wholesale banking division. for the full fy14, cimbs net profit declined 31.6% on-year to rm3.1 billion from rm4.54 billion, with allowance made for impairment losses, advances and financing jumped 131% on-year to a whopping rm1.52 billion. annual fy14 roe was at 9.2%, down 6.3 percentage points compared with 15.5% in fy13. banking analysts and industry observers said the groups cost ballooned over the years as it had been expanding via acquisitions. its purchase of royal bank of scotland in 2012, which turned the latter into an asia-pacific ib player, had raised questions as to whether cimb had overstretched itself. analysts said the group has yet to break even on the acquisition. on the latest mss, cimb group chief executive officer tengku datuk zafrul aziz (pic) said in a statement: this exercise is fully voluntary and is aimed at enhancing our efficiency levels across the board. this is consistent with roe and cir plans we have outlined for the future. some of our employees from malaysia and indonesia have also enquired about these types of schemes, so this mss is also a response to them. the scheme is said to have received backing from the board of commissioners and board of directors of cimb niaga, indonesias fifth-largest bank in terms of assets, deposits, lending and branch distribution network, as the move is consistent with the indonesian lenders operating strategies. employees who are interested in the mss are expected to submit their applications by may 29, 2015. successful applicants will receive packages based on rank and years of service, as well as options for extended medical cover for three years and participation in re-skilling and outplacement programmes. cimb (fundamental:

value since its june 2012 initial public offering (ipo), is likely to be removed from the list of the 30 ftse bursa malaysia klci constituent stocks come june 22, said analysts. fgv (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 1.4) was selected an index constituent in december 2012 at a time when its market capitalisation stood at some rm19 billion. its market cap is now just rm7.59 billion. in a report last friday, maybank ib research sees fgv exiting as an fbm klci constituent as it ranked 41st in terms of market cap, and being replaced by westports holdings bhd which ranked 28th by market cap at rm14.83 billion. the fbm klci index series is reviewed semi-annually by the independent ftse bursa malaysia index advisory committee. according to maybank ib research, the list is due for a review, using share prices at market close on may 25, 2015. the constituent changes will be implemented after the market closes on june 19, and will be effective june 22. among the companies currently on the list are public bank bhd, tenaga nasional bhd, malayan banking bhd, cimb group holdings bhd and axiata group bhd. rhb research institute head of research alexander chia is also of the view that fgv will be dropped from the fbm klci constituent list next month. he pointed to the five counters on the fbm klci reserve list, namely ytl power international bhd, gamuda bhd, westports, hap seng consolidated bhd and ijm corp bhd, that will likely take over fgvs place. in a report dated april 6, 2015, kenanga research also did not rule out the risk of fgv being removed from the fbm klci constituent list during the next review should its share price decline further. it noted that fgvs share price has performed poorly in the last six months, plummeting 38% since october 2014 compared with the kl plantation index which declined 6% in the same period. however, the risk to fgvs potential exit as an fbm klci constituent is that the stock may drop off the radar of institutional investors. already, fgv has drawn flak for its poor share price performance, which, at last fridays closing price of rm2.08, is less than half of its ipo price of rm4.55. its net profit for the financial year ended dec 31, 2014 (fy14) also came in below consensus expectations, due to larger downstream losses and higher minority interest. it saw net profit plunge 68.8% to rm306.37 million

industry", "article": " cement consumption in malaysia will not be robust in the near future, even though there are ongoing infrastructure projects. the key factor that has curbed the growth in demand is the slowdown in the property sector. lower energy costs expected this year will provide some breathing space for cement producers such as lafarge malaysia bhd, tasek corp bhd and hume industries bhd. demand, however, is forecast to increase between 3% and 4% this year  lower than last years 5% to 6% growth, according to analysts covering the cement sector. the property development sector makes up 50% to 60% of total cement demand in malaysia, says alliancedbs research analyst woo kim toh, who covers lafarge malaysia. with the sector slowing down, infrastructure projects were expected to pick up the slack. however, demand from infrastructure projects such as the mrt line 2 and lrt extensions have largely been priced in to the share prices of cement producers. compounding the situation is the additional capacity expected to come on stream this year. ytl cement bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ytl corp bhd (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 1.4), will add 1.5 million tonnes or 8% capacity to the industry. market leader lafarge malaysia (fundamental: 1.8; valuation: 1.1) is currently expanding the capacity of its plants in rawang, selangor, and kanthan, perak, which will add 1.2 million tonnes to the industry. interestingly, lafarge malaysia and tasek corp (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 1.7) are still trading at high price-earnings ratio of 33 times and 19 times respectively. indeed, the valuations are higher than that of construction companies such as wct holdings bhd and gamuda bhd, which are trading at 16 times earnings per share. the illiquid nature of lafarge malaysia and tasek corp is partly to blame for the persistently high valuations. lafarge sa of france holds a 51% stake in lafarge malaysia, followed by the employees provident fund with 9%, while hl cement (m) sdn bhd and aberdeen asset management hold 74.3% and 20.24% equity interest respectively in tasek corp. institutional investors and funds like to hold on to cement producers because of the decent yield. despite the below-expectation results of lafarge malaysia last year, the company still paid good dividends, says woo. dividend yields of cement producers stand at 3% to 4%, based on last thursdays share price. despite the expected slowdown in demand, lafarge malaysia president and chief executive bradley mulroney is still sanguine about the prospects of the cement market. market demand is reasonably strong. there are still a lot of infrastructure and housing developments taking place, mulroney tells the edge. however, large infrastructure projects only account for about 40% of the total cement market in malaysia, he says, adding that the property development sector is the driving force behind local cement demand. even if you get very strong growth in infrastructure, it only makes up 40% of the market anyway. it is very important but not to be exaggerated. the difficult market conditions for cement producers can be seen from the keen price competition. cement producers compete by giving customers rebates. according to alliancedbs researchs woo, during good times when demand is strong, the rebate ranges from rm30 to rm40 per tonne. due to the slowing demand from the property development sector and the impending excess capacity, cement producers have been reducing their prices even more. on average, cement producers have been giving rebates of up to rm100 per bag, says woo. lower energy costs a slight reprieve energy costs make up about 30% to 40% of the production cost. the recent 5.8% average reduction in electricity tariffs until oct 15 is a temporary reprieve for cement manufacturers, cimb research analyst sharizan rosely says in a report dated feb 17. however, it is still insufficient to offset the average tariff increase of 16.9% last year, he adds. lower coal prices this year compared with last year will also benefit cement producers. coal prices fell to us$56.60 per tonne on april 15, 26.2% lower than a year ago. coal is largely used to fire rotary kilns during the blending of the raw materials to produce cement. nevertheless, the weak ringgit has erased this advantage  coal is mostly imported and are priced in us dollars, says a senior industry executive. the industrys practice of buying coal up to 24 months in advance could also have worsened the situation, as companies may have locked in a

traditionally matched each other when it comes to pricing cigarettes. each cost increase or tax hike is usually followed by a rise in selling prices across the sector to defend profit margins. but british american tobacco (m) bhd recently reversed a price hike  the second reversal in just over half a year  after its 50 sen per 20-pack raise was not matched by competitors. this could be a sign that bat is losing its price leadership in malaysia and i dont discount a price war brewing, an analyst with a local bank-backed research house tells the edge. this time around, philip morris (m) sdn bhd and jt international tobacco sdn bhd (jti) did not follow bats lead and it shows that they might be wanting to break the tradition of bat being the price setter. bat (fundamental: 1.35; valuation: 1.7) had raised the price per 20-pack by 50 sen following the implementation of the goods and services tax on april 1 while philip morris had gone for a lower 40 sen mark-up per pack. surprisingly, jti maintained its selling price. bat, the only listed company among the three, then cut the price per pack by 20 sen  10 sen below philip morris price (see table). some corners cite the malaysia competition commissions greater scrutiny since january last year and fears of running afoul of the competition act 2010 for tobacco manufacturers bucking the price trend. but most believe that it is simply a sign of competition heating up to capture a larger slice of the shrinking pie. philip morris might decrease prices in response and decide to absorb the cost of gst in the process, the analyst says, adding that producers now seem open to taking a cut in profit margins in order to defend their market share. the few sen difference will have an impact, especially in the value-for-money segment where consumers are more likely to switch brands because of price considerations, the analyst comments. bat learnt this lesson in september last year when it raised its selling price by rm1 per pack but was only matched by jti. in september 2014, bats sales volume fell 10% year on year as it lost market share due to the disparity between its selling prices and those of its competitors in the two weeks before it reversed its decision, cimb research analyst eing kar mei says in an april 13 note. this time, if philip morris decides on a price reduction as a countermove, bat may need to embark on another round of price cuts to maintain its market share, she adds. eing, who has lowered bats target price to rm58, recommends that investors reduce their exposure to the stock in view of regulatory and competition risks. bat closed at rm68.28 last thursday. as of now, bat is estimated to command 62% of the total legal market while jti and philip morris have 22% and 16% respectively, according to data by amresearch. analysts expect the pie to shrink, no thanks to the growing illicit trade as regulatory enforcement moves at a slow pace. in 2013, the contraband market made up 35.7% of the total industry. the legal market is shrinking. the pie is getting smaller and you cannot always push for higher prices, says another analyst with a local research house. people like to think that the tobacco market is inelastic but there is a threshold. people might reduce their buying now that cigarettes are so expensive and incomes are not rising. they could stop smoking altogether or even turn to illicit cigarettes or e-cigarettes. the consensus expectation is for volume to continue to decline this year. we maintain our forecast for industry volume to contract 10% this year mainly due to the steep excise duty-led price hikes of 12% to 14% imposed in november 2014, uob kay hian research analyst vincent khoo says in an april 13 note. the november price hike, however, should keep margins fairly insulated this year, says the analyst with the local bank-backed research house. in fact, we could see a slight expansion this year because of that price increase. but if volumes fall by 15% to 20%, producers might not be able to absorb the cost, she says, adding though that this is unlikely. in any case, bat seems to be in a more comfortable position to weather a margin compression than the other two because of its sizeable market share. at press time, the edge had yet to receive comments from bat, jti or philip morris.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on april

bonus issue, a proposed transfer listing from the ace market to the main market and proposed amendments to its articles of association. the transfer is to be implemented upon completion of the proposed bonus issue while the transfer and amendments are inter-conditional upon each other. for its most recent fourth quarter financial year 2014 (4qfy14) results, heng huats revenue inched up to rm23.21 million from rm23.08 million in 4qfy13 and represented a marginal increase of approximately rm130,000. further to the positive quarter, heng huat also recorded a 24.3% increase in revenue for fy14 of rm17.9 million to rm91.6 million. the increase in revenue was mainly attributed to the improved revenue from the biomass materials and related products segment arising from higher demand for palm oil empty fruit bunch fibre, particularly from the china market, coupled with improved margins. further to the announcement, heng huats board of directors is of the view that the groups growth momentum is sustainable for fy15, as the recent ban on new coal-fired plants in beijing, shanghai and guangzhou is likely to spur demand for cleaner, alternative sources of energy, including briquettes. a check on bloomberg consensus reveals that no research house covers the stock. heng huat currently trades at a reasonable price-earnings ratio of 12.5 times. its price-to-book value ratio of 2.19 times indicates that its share price is trading at a premium to its book value. heng huats chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frame is very firmly up. its share price made a good surge since its major daily wave-2 low of 46 sen on march 5 2014. since that low, heng huat surged to its recent all-time high of 73.5 sen in may 2015. as prices broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of 62 sen and 67 sen, look to buy heng huat on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term uptrends for this stock. the daily

reverse in 2016", "article": " kuala lumpur: malaysian companies are expected to shake off the trend of disappointing earnings in the past four years from 2016 onwards, said cimb investment bank bhd head of research terence wong. thats when crude oil prices should stabilise and the ringgit will trend towards a level reflecting the economys fundamentals, he added. consumption spending in malaysia would also have normalised by then, following the implementation of the goods and services tax [on april 1 this year], he told the edge financial daily in an interview on the sidelines of invest malaysia 2015 recently. wong noted that corporate earnings in malaysia have been disappointing for the last 16 quarters  companies that surprised on the upside in earnings were fewer compared with those that underperformed. earnings delivery in the fourth quarter of 2014 (4q14) accentuated the trend due to the slump in commodity prices, most notably crude oil, as well as the weaker ringgit against the us dollar. i think it (disappointing earnings) could start to reverse next year, said wong. wong expects earnings for the first quarter of 2015 to likely disappoint again. i think the [disappointing] trend will likely continue. i expect a not-so-great quarter coming up, he said. whether the first-quarter earnings will disappoint slightly or significantly is anybodys guess, but wong said it will reflect the financial resilience of malaysian companies. he pointed out cimb ib had concerns about last years fourth-quarter results, but as it turned out, corporate earnings were not as bad as the research house had initially feared. there seems to be some resilience. but the first-quarter earnings will probably be a big indication because it is the start of 2015, he said. wongs preferred sector picks remain the construction, transportation and export-oriented as well as selective smaller-capitalisation stocks. he sees the construction sector being a major beneficiary of the countrys mega projects related to transportation infrastructure such as the klang valley mass rapid transit lines 1 and 2, the light rail transit line three and the high-speed rail project linking kuala lumpur to singapore. all of these are construction-related, which are positive for contractors, he said, citing gamuda bhd (fundamental: 2.2; valuation: 1.2) and ijm corp bhd (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 1.4) as its top picks. wong also likes transport-related stocks such as misc bhd (fundamental: 2; valuation: 1) and westports holdings bhd (fundamental: n/a; valuation: n/a) as they are beneficiaries of lower fuel costs due to lower crude oil prices. he also prefers export-oriented stocks such as rubber glove and furniture makers, given the relatively stronger us dollar which would translate into higher earnings in ringgit. the ringgit was trading at 3.5700 against the us dollar last thursday compared with around 3.20 six months ago. apart from sector-related stocks, wong is also positive on small-cap stocks as they have largely outperformed bigger-cap stocks last year. however, he is selective on small-cap companies that reflect solid business models with positive cash flow positions. he cited stocks like myeg services bhd (fundamental: 3; valuation: 1.1), prestariang bhd (fundamental: 1.95; valuation: 0.5), ghl systems bhd (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 0.2), karex bhd (fundamental: n/a; valuation: n/a) and ifca msc bhd (fundamental: 3; valuation: 0.8). these stocks outperformed last year. year-to-date, they have also been big outperformers, he said. eight out of 10 of our smaller- cap stock picks have a net cash position. so, even in the worst situation, they will still be around, said wong. as for the oil and gas (o&g) sector, wong has an overweight call on the sector given the cheap valuations  a consequence of lower crude oil prices. he described the sector as tricky given the strong correlation between crude oil prices and malaysian o&g stocks. wong was baffled that although most malaysian o&g companies are service providers and are not operating in the upstream segment, their stocks still took a hit when crude oil prices plunged last year. they are just servicing [the sector], yet their share prices took a big hit as though their earnings are a function of oil prices. oil prices may fall by half, but their earnings dont fall by half, he said. even so, wong is cognisant that if crude oil prices continue to remain low, petroliam nasional bhd might review its contracts and margins in the sector. meanwhile, wong remains cautious about the banking sector as net interest margins continue to see pressure, while crude palm oil prices that fluctuate with oil prices could hamper the plantation sector. he is also cautious about the property sector as cooling measures under budget 2014 and the gst implementation would curb property demand this year. wong said property demand might track in tandem with retail and consumer spending patterns, noting that this is likely to take six to nine months to normalise. still, wong is positive on property developers with strong execution capabilities whether through rain or shine such as mah sing group bhd (fundamental: 2; valuation: 2.4) and eco world development group bhd (fundamental: 0.5; valuation: 0). you will probably see six to nine months of low sales. if developers dont see increasing sales, after a while their earnings will also start to decrease. so, we have to be quite selective on property stocks, he said. however, he is of the view that the property sector will be a big winner over the long term of 10 to 15 years as there will be more demand for property, especially first-time homebuyers. wong said malaysias demographic dividend would increase as more young people enter the workforce while dependents such as young children and the ageing folks decrease. the first-time homebuyers age is from 25 to 35. so, [there is] this huge group of people [who] are moving into that age range when they will buy their first home. the next 10 to 15 years are going to be positive [for the property sector], he added. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a

(fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 2.4) is considering an internal reorganisation. one is the impact of the financial services act (fsa) on financial holding companies, resulting in them having to beef up their capital, and the other is to make the groups structure more tax efficient, says the source. before the regulations changed, one could claim tax deductions on interest payments on debt. in other words, there was a tax shield for income. but after moving into a single-tier tax structure for dividends last year, dividends have become tax exempt. as dividends are tax exempt, there is no income with which to offset tax  the tax shield is gone. so, rhb caps current structure is tax inefficient, notes the source. a plan for a corporate internal reorganisation at rhb cap is not new. it makes sense for the group to revisit an internal reorganisation to create a more efficient structure for the group, following the failed proposed merger with cimb (group holdings bhd  fundamental: 1.05; valuation: 1.5) and mbsb (malaysia building society bhd  fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 2.4), says an industry observer. the edge wrote in march 2013 that there was a proposal to restructure rhb cap in an exercise that entailed its privatisation, in an effort to create better value and improve tax efficiency. the comprehensive proposal suggested that rhb bank be relisted later and that the banking group be enlarged with the subsequent injection of mbsb. according to documents sighted by the edge then, the rationale for the proposal was to prepare the group for changes after the implementation of the new fsa and to create a more efficient platform for dividend payments and further strengthen the capital base. the article noted that the timing of the restructuring and whether or not the major shareholders of the group had decided to go ahead with the proposal remained unknown. when asked if mbsb would be included in the current reorganisational plan, the source says, unlikely. privatisation [of rhb cap] is also an option today but it makes more sense to directly turn rhb bank into the listed entity of the group. it will also take up less time, says the source. financial holding companies have started preparing for stricter capital requirements to be enforced in 2019, which will require them to retain more capital. additionally, the basel committee has been raising the bar to improve the supervision of financial groups globally. a senior banker notes that banks with double leverage ratios will be affected. they will have difficulty in doing what theyve been doing historically. double leverage means the holding company takes up debt and pumps it into a subsidiary as capital. at the subsidiary, it looks like capital because it is equity, but it is not. this is why banking groups that have a listed financial holding company at the top, like rhb cap and hlfg (hong leong financial group bhd  fundamental: 2.6; valuation: 2.4), need to relook at their capital position and structure. maybank investment bank research in a march 4 note says hong leong bank bhd (fundamental: 2.8; valuation: 2.2), hlfg and rhb cap are likely to raise capital this year. hong leong banks management has made known its intention to raise the banks cet1 ratio to about 1% to 2% above the regulatory minimum. the fully loaded cet1 ratio at hong leong bank group level was 9.2% at the end of last year, but it was just 8.1% at the bank level. hlfg, meanwhile, will have to raise capital as well to subscribe for its portion of hong leong banks rights, given its 64% stake in the commercial bank, the research house notes. rhb cap needs to take its double leverage ratio of 137% down to below 120% as it targets a higher cet1 ratio versus its current fully loaded cet1 ratio of 9.8%. meanwhile, a senior banking analyst notes that the hong leong group could also consider exploring a corporate restructuring apart from making a rights issue to comply with stricter capital requirements. hlfg could consider a share swap to privatise hong leong bank or maybe even contemplate distributing hong leong bank shares to hlfg shareholders. note: the edge research's

neave holdings bhd (f&n) last week. the contract of the groups wholly-owned subsidiary, f&n beverages marketing sdn bhd, to exclusively distribute red bull energy drinks was not renewed, ending a five-year relationship. this marks the second time in the last decade that the exclusive rights of f&n (fundamental: 2.10; valuation: 0.90) to distribute internationally recognised brands have not been renewed. the first time was in 2009, when the coca-cola co decided not to renew its agreement with f&n to bottle and distribute soft drinks coca-cola and sprite  a key contributor to the groups earnings  in malaysia. the contract lapsed in 2011, ending a 75-year relationship with the us-based soft drink manufacturer. now, f&ns red bull contract, which generated an estimated 5% of its profit, is also gone. surprisingly, the market did not respond to the news. f&ns share price remained flattish after the announcement on march 27. last friday, the counter traded unchanged at rm18.20 per share. f&n beverages and allexcel agreed not to renew the term of the principal agreement as both parties are unable to reach an agreement on the changes in commercial terms, f&n says in its announcement to bursa malaysia. the company was awarded the contract to market, distribute and sell red bull energy drinks  red bull u00ae less sugar, 250ml red bull u00ae gold in cans and 150ml red bull u00ae bottle  in malaysia in 2010. that represented all the red bull products available in the market at that juncture. according to cimb research, f&n managed to double red bulls sales volume within the five-year contract period  from two million cases in 2010 to four million. based on our estimates, red bull, which has a 70% share of the energy drink market, could be contributing more than rm200 million to f&ns revenue and more than 5% of f&ns net profit as it commands good margins, says the research house. using cimb researchs estimates, this would mean red bull energy drinks contributed about 5% to the groups revenue based on its results for the financial year ended sept 30, 2014 (fy2014). f&ns first year without coca-colas contribution saw its revenue decline to rm3.17 billion in fy2012 from rm3.82 billion in fy2011. net profit fell to rm272.6 million from rm383.1 million during the same period. that was also the year that f&ns thai operations were hit by flooding, causing a 200-day cessation of business in the groups dairy product manufacturing there. coca-colas contribution of rm544 million to f&ns revenue was also significantly larger than red bulls. nevertheless, analysts believe the latest development is only a temporary setback for the soft drink manufacturer. amresearch highlights in its report that f&n enlarged its product portfolio with mycola and 100plus edge after its separation from coca-cola. its soft drink sales volume has recovered to almost (coca-cola) pre-termination level, says the research house. analysts also believe that the end of red bulls contract means that f&n can shift its focus back to building its own brands and developing new products. amresearch opines that f&n and its new ultimate holding company, thai beverage pcl, will be able to achieve synergy that would help cushion the shortfall from the loss of red bulls contribution. f&n currently distributes thai beverages oshi drinks  thailands best-selling tea brand  in malaysia. it is said to be brewing thai beverages oshi tea and est cola locally this year, which would improve its profit margins. amresearch expects more cross-selling with the groups thai parent going forward. in fy2014, f&ns soft drink division grew 3.5% domestically while its export volume expanded 22.7%, thanks to its 100plus and f&n seasons range, says its 2014 annual report. as it stands, f&n commands the largest share of the local isotonic drink market with its own brand  100plus  dominating 80% of it. the company also claims that its f&n seasons ready-to-drink tea range and nutrisoy range are the local market leaders. f&ns revenue has been recovering from a dip in fy2012. it made consecutive year-on-year gains, increasing from rm3.17 billion in fy2012 to rm3.82 billion in fy2014. however, net profit has been moving in the opposite direction, declining from rm272.6 million in fy2012 to rm259.4 million in fy2014. in its first quarter ended dec 31, 2014, revenue rose 9.3% from a year ago to rm1.036 billion while net profit inched up 1.7% to rm69.94 million. the first-quarter earnings were propped up by the dairy division with sales improving 20.6% at dairies thailand and 9.4% at dairies malaysia. however, the soft drink division saw a marginal rise in sales due to the east coast floods and later commencement of chinese new year activities. over the last year, f&ns share price has been trading between rm15.40 and rm19.12, and analysts covering the stock have target prices ranging from rm15.40 and rm23.33. at rm18.20 per share, the stock has a price-earnings ratio of 25 times and according to the most optimistic target price of rm23.33 by cimb research, it has an upside potential of 28.2%. note: the edge researchs

valuation: 0.6) is in the business of manufacturing and distributing pesticides, including herbicides, insecticides and fungicides, as well as related agrochemicals. besides its eu certification, perhaps yu also likes the companys balance sheet, which showed net cash of rm51.3 million or 64 sen per share and zero borrowings as at dec 31, 2014. little-traded imaspro saw its volume skyrocket to 1.3 million compared with barely 200,000 shares a day in the past. the surge in interest sent up the companys share price to an all-time high of rm1.95 on march 25. however, it had retreated to rm1.74 by last friday. imaspro is trading at a price-earnings ratio of 16.4 times and has a market capitalisation of rm142.4 million. yu, who is ynh property bhd chairman and executive director, is now the second largest shareholder in imaspro with a 12.38% stake. his close associate, chan weng fui, has also emerged as a substantial shareholder with 5.49% equity interest or 4.39 million shares. chan is known to have worked closely with yu in past transactions, the most notable of which are rapid synergy bhd and pan malaysia holdings bhd  companies in which the latter has substantial interests. tong remains the single largest shareholder of imaspro with a 42.43% stake or 33.95 million shares through swiss revenue sdn bhd. he says imaspro plans to be more aggressive in the local market after successfully securing a tender recently to supply herbicides to sime darby plantation sdn bhd, although he notes that the contract is not much. we have not been actively involved in (tendering for projects) locally as we have been concentrating on overseas market growth. but we want to have a more aggressive policy on local plantations going forward, says tong, adding that management believes a stronger focus on the local plantation business would be worthwhile for imaspro. he says imaspro has come to a stage where its daily operations are on auto cruise. the companys net profit jumped from rm5.1 million in fy2012 to rm9.1 million in fy2014 but declined 10% to rm4.28 million in calendar year 2014. this was attributed to a lower margin caused by the fluctuating prices of its main raw material  glyphosate technical. in the second quarter ended dec 31, 2014 (2qfy2015), imaspros net profit fell to rm2.44 million from rm2.64 million in the previous corresponding period while revenue dropped to rm25.36 million from rm27.97 million. glyphosate is the most widely used agrochemical in the world. more than 50% of imaspros revenue is derived from glyphosate-related products, according to imaspros 2014 annual report. while the group purchasing policy keeps the procurement cycle to the shortest possible, we were nevertheless impacted by these widely fluctuating prices of glyphosate technical, it says, noting that the price of glyphosate technical went on a roller-coaster ride last year. cimb investment banks head of retail research for equities, kong seh siang, comments that should the raw materials price drop further, imaspro may have to write down more of its inventories. he says glyphosate prices have continued to weaken  from between us$4 and us$4.20 per kilogramme in 1qfy2015 to us$3.50 at present. imaspros lower revenue in the first half of fy2015 ended dec 31, 2014, was due to slower replanting of crops on subdued global commodity prices globally, kong points out. revenue decreased 11% to rm44.14 million from rm49.62 million a year ago in both the local and export segments, the weak outlook for commodity prices remains a banana skin here as planters may choose to defer purchases or even switch to cheaper pesticides in the near future, says kong.  crude palm oil prices had fallen 18.24% to rm2,156 per metric ton (mt) last thursday from rm2,637 a year ago. most research houses are neutral on the plantation sector with cpo price forecasts for this year ranging from about rm2,100 to rm2,700.  note: the edge research's fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers. a score of 3 suggests strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. go to www.theedgemarkets.com for details on a companys financial dashboard. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on april 6 - 12, 2015.

week when the end-to-end payment solutions provider signed a payment service provider arrangement (psp) with cimb bank bhd (cimb). this agreement will allow ghl to commence acquisition of merchants on behalf of cimb for the next three years to accept e-payment services at point of sale (pos) terminals. the companys revenue from this agreement will be derived from terminal rental and a share of the merchant discount rates. the partnership with cimb is also a follow-up to ghls first psp agreement with global payments card processing (m) sdn bhd, a partner of hsbc bank malaysia in january 2015. similarly, ghl is contracted by global payments card processing malaysia sdn bhd to acquire merchants on its behalf in exchange for terminal rental and a share of the merchant discount rates. apparently, ghl would not want to have only two banks as its clients for its tpa division. group chief executive officer raj lorenz revealed that the company is in talks with other local banks for more psp arrangements in the future now we have what we wanted  a large local bank like cimb, lorenz told the edge financial daily after the signing ceremony. he said the newly-formed alliance with cimb represents the next large stride forward for ghl because it opens the payment solutions firm to cimbs wide local and regional footprint. this is going to be a huge difference to us. the previous deal we announced was with global payments, but cimb is a major bank with a wide spread in the small and medium enterprise market and this is exactly what we wanted, lorenz said. the strategy of the company is clearly in the tpa segment. work for this agreement that we have signed has not started but the potential for this is massive since 90% of our population is underserved. our expectation is that our bottom line and top line should grow significantly when we execute this properly, he added. a leading indicator of ghls success in the tpa segment will be its merchant numbers, which it hopes will be boosted to the region of 1,000 newly-acquired merchants a month by the end of the year with cimb on its side. lorenz said the number is achievable because it has the reach, the scale, the technology and experience to reach merchants which other financial institutions or other competitors cannot reach profitably. in fact, ghl (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 0.2) has made millions in investments on its operation and risk systems to ensure that it is well positioned for the leading role in changing the landscape of malaysias cash-dependent market into one which favours electronic transactions. when a merchant is small, it becomes very challenging for a bank to offer a single product. we can do that because it is our core business, we have the scale of over 50,000 points of sale and a nationwide presence. we have everything built to do this and a ready delivery system, said lorenz. our terminals go out to very remote areas, places where terminals have never been. we have 5,000 gprs terminals because some places do not even have phone lines. we are hitting those markets, he added. ghl will be focused on the execution of the global payments and cimb deals and ironing out all the teething problems which may occur during the initial integration process. with bank negara malaysia (bnm) pushing banks toward the transition to a cashless society with a payment card reform framework, there will be no surprises that ghls services as a third-party acquirer will continue to be in demand. under the framework, bnm is aiming to raise the number of debit transactions from 89 million a year in 2015 to a billion transactions a year by 2020. it also wants the number of pos terminals to grow from the current 280,000 to 800,000 by 2020. the edge researchs fundamental

eyes peeled  the conglomerate may once again be taking the lead in another mega merger to grow even bigger in the property business. just last month, following the release of its results for the first half of the financial year ending june 30, 2015, cimb research regional plantation analyst ivy ng, among other analysts, tells clients in a note that sime darbys weaker earnings are likely to be partially offset by potential acquisitions and the planned listing of certain key businesses. for fy2014 ended june 30, its motor business contributed 15% to earnings while real estate accounted for 14%. as the worlds third largest dealer of caterpillar heavy machinery, sime darbys industrial segment is also sizeable, accounting for some 24% of group profits. its core plantation business remains the groups largest earnings contributor at 45% last year and it was not too long ago that its strength helped keep the group profitable when some of its other businesses suffered losses. for its latest 2q numbers, however, sime darbys plantation and industrial businesses  its two largest contributing core segments  recorded a 46% and 53% year-on-year slump in earnings before interest and tax. apart from sime darby posting its weakest industrial earnings since the 2008 merger and getting a lower average selling price for its crude palm oil (cpo) of rm2,154 per tonne for 1hfy2015, cimbs ng also notes that simes 2q fresh fruit bunches (ffb) output fell 15% y-o-y in 2qfy15 and 6% in 1hfy2015 instead of growing 5% in line with managements guidance. sime darby attributed this to poor weather, a shift in cropping patterns and higher planting activity. it now expects flattish ffb output for fy2015 and cpo prices to range between rm2,300 and rm2,500 per tonne between march and june this year. experts at the recent palm and laurics oil conference 2015 in kuala lumpur projected prices to average between rm1,940 and rm2,500 per tonne for 2015, with the strength of demand for biodiesel being the most influential factor. thats still not too shabby given that sime darby president and group ceo tan sri mohd bakke salleh says costs for large players like itself range from rm1,300 to rm1,500 per tonne. this puts gross margins at over 33% if cpo prices were to hover around rm2,000 per tonne. the cyclical nature of the industry is not something we are unfamiliar with. if you look at why prices move so rapidly, it comes down to basic demand and supply. whatever the underlying causes  weather, disease, demand created by new markets like biodiesel  price is a factor of demand and supply. in the shorter term, current prices will affect higher-cost, less efficient and smaller players. in the longer term, the prices will find their equilibrium, as will the industry, bakke tells the edge in an interview, pointing out that prices would find support from national policies such as indonesias b15 and possibly b20 biodiesel blend. this will mop up a lot of supply from the worlds largest exporter of the oil for domestic consumption, he says. to be sure, the strength of sime darbys balance sheet during the challenging time of lower cpo prices means that it is better positioned to be a purchaser should smaller operators throw in the towel. yet, the verdict is split on whether sime darby paid a good price for its recently completed purchase of new britain palm oil ltd. sime darby is also not yet on top of the game in some areas, perhaps due to its size. analysts point out that smaller planters such as united plantations bhd achieve higher oil extraction rates (oer) and better ffb yield per hectare (yield/ha). while sime darbys group oer rose from 21.73% in 1hfy2014 to 21.8% in 1hfy2015, this is still below united plantations 22.5% in fy2013 and 22.77% in fy2014. during the same period, united plantations ffb yield/ha rose from 20.83 tonnes in 2013 to 21.4 tonnes in 2014. in its latest 1hfy15 earnings briefing, sime darby said its group ffb yield/ha fell in 1hfy2015, something which it attributed to higher replanting activity that resulted in the increase of immature hectarage, a shift in cropping trends, prolonged drought in the first half of 2014 as well as the impact of floods at the end of 2014. these are all valid reasons but observers reckon more should be done to ensure that numbers from its plantations business are a lot better. in this regard, sime darby has indeed come up with a game plan. bakke says a number of measures have already been implemented to vigorously manage costs. even our capex has been reviewed and we have halved our budgeted capex from rm7.4 billion to rm3.7 billion for the year. on the productivity and revenue side, whatever measures that are humanly possible are being worked on today  increasing revenue or ensuring we do not lose yields. pending results in this area, analysts and investors are looking out for a non-plantation catalyst from the group to boost sentiment on the stock.  this

help wct deleverage", "article": " wct holdings bhd maintains that its gearing level is still acceptable. it also assures investors that it faces no cash flow issue, despite the fact that it has recently proposed a rights issue to raise some rm143.23 million to fund its working capital. the proposed cash call, deemed a small exercise given wcts (fundamental: 0.6; valuation: 1.8) market capitalisation of rm1.58 billion, came as a surprise as the group was sitting on some rm950.84 million cash as at dec 31, 2014. the cash made up a big part of wcts current assets of rm2.72 billion, which was a healthy 1.68 times over its current liabilities of rm1.62 billion  most of which were in the form of short-term borrowings of rm584.11 million. on such a premise, some have questioned wct on the need for the one-for-ten rights issue, which could dilute earnings per share. however, analysts point to the groups overall high gearing level that needs to be trimmed, at a time when property-related earnings could be facing pressure. wcts net gearing level has spiked up significantly to a net total borrowing of rm1.48 billion or 0.65 times its shareholders funds as at dec 31, 2014, from rm948.74 million or 0.42 times as at dec 31, 2013. as at dec 31, 2014, the groups short and long-term borrowings were rm584.11 million and rm1.85 billion, respectively. in the last five years, there was an aggressive expansion in landbanking as well as in the property investment and management segment. as a result, borrowings increased but the current gearing is still acceptable and within our internal targets, wct head of corporate and finance chong kian fah tells the edge. the landbanking spree increased the groups total assets by 12.1% to rm6.2 billion as at dec 31, 2014. some rm994.16 million worth of land is being held for development, compared with rm640.38 million previously. however, total liabilities increased much more quickly by 19% to rm3.92 billion as at dec 31, 2014, from rm3.28 billion the year before. chong explains that the groups debt load will lighten by the end of this year. the increase in short-term borrowings are in respect of a medium-term note which is due this year. the group has existing cash to repay [the loans], he says. in a recent note, cimb research said the rights issue is crucial in helping wct to deleverage itself in the meantime. rights issues are typically negative for share prices but support longer-term strategies, says its analyst sharizan rosely, who has a hold call on the stock. ultimately, the cash call could be deemed as buying time while the group prepares to list some of its investment properties through a real estate investment trust (reit). chong says plans for a reit consisting of three retail malls are back on track, and that the assets value has appreciated thanks to the solid growth of its gateway mall at klia2. in january, wct executive director kenny wong yik kae told reporters that the listing may take another year to finalise. wcts three retail assets are the bandar bukit tinggi shopping mall in klang, paradigm mall in petaling jaya and the gateway mall, which it operates under a long-term concession agreement with malaysia airports holdings bhd. while the other two are maturing assets, the mall at the new low-cost carrier terminal has only been in operation for less than a year. the mall is currently seeing 101,000 footfalls a day and has a 77% occupancy rate, notes chong.  we are in the process of finalising the planning (of the reit) and hopefully, we can list this year should we decide to proceed. the current valuation of the malls is about rm2.2 billion. the spin-off will lighten wcts financing burden and at the same time, shareholders of the parent company will stand to benefit via a possible distribution of the reit units. as the property sector outlook gets tough, analysts say it is crucial that the group begins deleveraging and monetising its assets as soon as possible. their view is that the new cash call will not only dilute earnings on a per-share basis, it is also indicative of wcts need for external financing to address typical working capital requirements. any further delays in its reported reit plans or launches of new property investments would likely strain wcts cash flows further, says amresearch analyst mak hoy ken in a recent note. in spite of the growth in assets and liabilities, decreasing margins and slower pre-sales from the property segment had a detrimental effect on wcts fy2014 earnings, with the group reporting a 36% drop in net profit to rm120.53 million, from rm189.75 million a year earlier. nevertheless, apart from the reit exercise, several new catalysts may help improve confidence in the stock, which is currently trading at a steep discount to its book value per share of rm2.04. earlier this month, wct clinched a rm1.2 billion infrastructure contract in qatar, its biggest deal in years. as a 70% partner in the joint venture, its share of the rm840 million worth of construction works brings its total order book to rm3.9 billion, an increase of 40%. cimb research notes that wcts management is also looking to secure a further rm1 billion in domestic construction projects this year. our main growth catalyst this year is the engineering and construction division. more projects are being rolled out in malaysia this year and we are positive on the outlook of both local and domestic projects, says chong. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and

interest in its wholly owned aircraft leasing company, which was formed less than a year ago, or list the unit. the proposals are in but no banks have been assigned yet. a decision will be made within six months, airasia group ceo tan sri tony fernandes tells the edge. besides building the budget carriers war chest, he adds, the proceeds from the sale will be utilised to buy back shares and pay dividends. airasia (fundamental: 0.2; valuation: 0.6) got the green light from the labuan financial services authority last september to start its leasing business in the federal territory. the low-cost carrier then incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary known as asia aviation capital ltd (aac) to provide aircraft leasing services to the airasia group, including airasia x and affiliate companies outside malaysia, namely thai airasia co ltd, pt indonesia airasia, airasia inc, zest airways inc and airasia india pvt ltd, and future associate companies. with an initial paid-up capital of us$100, aac owns and manages at least 70 aircraft. its principal activities are acquiring aircraft and securing financing for them, providing operating leases to the affiliates, managing the portfolio of aircraft, including technical services, and remarketing aircraft leases and/or the sale of aircraft. currently, datuk kamarudin meranun, aireen omar and rozman omar are the directors of aac. although fernandes did not elaborate on the prospects for the leasing business, an indication of how big it could be are the 322 airplanes  58 a320-200s and 264 a320neos  that the airasia group has ordered from airbus industrie. this compares with only 150 airplanes currently owned and operated by airasia. the plan to sell a stake in the leasing unit or spin it off comes after reports that said airasia was considering a sale and leaseback arrangement for its aircraft  which carry a book value of more than rm7 billion  to improve its cash position and take advantage of the stronger us dollar and lock in some disposable gains. earlier, fernandes was quoted by the media as saying that airasia would dispose of 11 a320 airplanes for us$271 million (rm1 billion) under sale and leaseback agreements, which analysts estimate would see airasia gain us$45 million (rm166.5 million). there are many reasons why investors could warm up to airasias plan to expand its leasing business. for one, like in most transport industries, aircraft lessors have proved to be among the most profitable in the aviation industry over the past decade. additionally, a cash infusion of any kind will do the airasia group some good and in this instance, it will potentially reduce its net gearing ratio. as at dec 31, 2014, airasias total borrowings stood at rm12.7 billion while its cash balance was rm1.3 billion, which translates into net gearing of 2.5 times. fernandes has quashed rumours that he is raising equity cash, although airasia is monetising its assets, its most recent disposal being a 25% stake in aae travel pte ltd, which resulted in a gain of rm279.6 million and cash flow of rm306.2 million. according to public invest research, other investments that the lcc can divest include the remaining 25% it owns in aae travel, a 50% stake in asian aviation centre of excellence sdn bhd and 50% equity interest in think big digital sdn bhd. whopping receivables several research houses have

airasias estimated 2014 book value. in a march 24 note, alliance research says airasias shares have fallen 26% from their peak in december 2014, following the qz8501 crash, concerns over a strengthening us dollar and the launch of new airline, flymojo. it says while these concerns are valid, the market may have overly punished the stock as its valuation remains decent at 7.1 times forward for the financial year ending dec 31, 2015. its target price implies a complete write-off of iaas related assets (receivables, equity and so on). cimb equities research downgraded airasia from

datuk seri najib tun razak's speech at invest malaysia 2015", "article": " it is my pleasure to welcome you today to invest malaysia 2015. this is our eleventh year, and i am glad to see so many thought leaders, key capital market players, and top executives gathered here for an annual two day conference that has grown into one the most important showcases of what we have achieved here in malaysia u2013 and of all the many opportunities that malaysia has to offer, both as an investment destination of its own, and as the gateway to asean. we are confident in the course we are pursuing, and i am sure you will be too after i outline a brief overview of the current state of our economy. between 2009 and 2014, gross national income grew by 47.7 percent. foreign direct investment has reached record highs. when we meet our target for 2015, we will have reduced the fiscal deficit for a record six years in a row. around the world, these have been unsettling and difficult times for many economies. i am pleased to say that, thanks to the stability of our institutions and the diversification of our economic structure, malaysia has remained on track. we recorded very strong growth of 6 percent in 2014. both the imf and the world bank have revised downwards their global economic growth estimates for 2015, to 3.5 percent and 3.0 percent, respectively. however, we expect to see malaysia grow by between 4.5 percent and 5.5 percent in 2015. and over the next four years, the oecd predicts our country will enjoy annual growth of 5.6 percent. our economic fundamentals are strong. we are on track to achieve our goal of reaching high income nation status by 2020. however, we must not only maintain our momentum but build on it. this is why the reforms we have enacted under the economic transformation programme are vital. these include: establishing the fiscal policy committee to reduce waste, to prevent misuse of funds and to optimise our operating expenditure. we have taken firm measures to control inflation, and we have seen the results. food inflation, for instance, has dropped from 3.9 percent a year ago to 2.8 percent last month. there have been major reforms in the energy sector. subsidies have been removed, with prices of petrol and diesel now being fixed by a managed float system, allowing more public resources to be spent on development and infrastructure projects for all. and most recently, we oversaw the introduction of the goods and services tax, or gst. this is a key part of the biggest series of tax reforms in the history of our country, the aim of which is to make the taxation system more effective, transparent and business friendly. gst in malaysia has gone through rigorous and detailed study. with its implementation, the ministry of finance has made its calculation and anticipates that gdp will increase by 0.3 percent and exports by 0.5 percent. our products will be extra competitive in the international market, as no gst will be applied on exported goods and services, while malaysian firms will benefit from a lower cost of doing business by recovering any input taxes. those facts alone may be enough to convince you that malaysia is among the very best emerging market opportunities today. but now let me share the opinions of others. bloomberg has rated malaysia as the worlds 5th most promising emerging market in 2015 and the only asean country in its top 10. that is very gratifying and supports the hard work that we have been doing, especially when you realize that our population of almost 30 million industrious people now sits alongside china in bloombergs top five. the imf and the world bank have both recently issued reports showing malaysia near the top of their rankings for competitiveness and ease of doing business. we are ranked alongside asias developed markets, such as japan, hong kong and singapore, by the asian corporate governance association. and according to the world economic forum global competitiveness report, malaysia comes: - 1st for financial market legal rights - 4th for financial market development, and - 8th for ease of financing through the equity market michael hershman, the co-founder of transparency international, recently visited and praised malaysia as a friendly country to do business in. as well he might. the 2015 index of economic freedom, a joint venture between the heritage foundation and the wall street journal, recently ranked malaysia as the 31st freest economy out of 178 countries. countries that score highly are more likely to be associated with a range of positive outcomes, including economic growth and per capita income, cleaner environments, good education and healthcare, human development and poverty elimination. and our ranking places us well above many titans and long developed countries. we are over 40 places higher than france and italy, for example u2013 the sixth and ninth largest economies in the world. there has been some talk lately in malaysia about how it can be lonely telling the truth. well, i can tell you that i dont feel lonely standing here in front you all today! and when so many respected international bodies, individuals and institutions have confirmed their belief in malaysias success, and have honoured us by rating us so highly, i dont feel lonely at all u2013 in fact, i feel in very good company! and i am equally confident that, given the well-known stability and growth of malaysia under this government, i will be able to look forward to the pleasure of your company both next year and for years to come. bursa malaysia has played an important part in these successes, and we thank you and your co-sponsor, cimb, for hosting this conference. malaysias capital market has witnessed strong growth and currently stands at 2.82 trillion ringgit, almost three times the size of the malaysian economy, with the equity market at 1.74 trillion ringgit and the bond market at 1.08 trillion ringgit. the scale of capital market-based financing has also deepened significantly, with an annual average of 111 billion ringgit raised through corporate bonds and ipos over the last three years. this is more than double the corresponding average of 48 billion ringgit a decade ago. growth in the fund management industry has been an important driver of capital market deepening, with 630 billion ringgit under management as of the end of 2014. malaysia also has a well-developed islamic fund management industry, holding 22 percent of the 73 billion dollars islamic assets under management globally in 2014. we currently have 20 companies operating under the islamic fund management license issued by the securities commission, in addition to 21 fund management companies that operate 'islamic windows' alongside their conventional business, offering a diverse range of shariah-compliant investment products and services. in order to make the most of this opportunity, and firmly establish malaysia as the global leader in this field, the securities commission is developing a comprehensive blueprint for malaysia's islamic fund and wealth management industry that will be ready by the end of this year. the blueprint will chart the medium and long term strategic direction for the industry as well as map out strategies and recommendations to strengthen the country's competitive edge. within the industry as a whole, the securities commission is committed to further expansion. new categories of licenses for boutique fund management companies will be introduced, and the range of permissible activities for fund management companies will be broadened to allow them to provide investment advice to clients via advisory mandates. the securities commission is also focused on widening the peoples investment choices and promoting greater inclusivity. in line with this, approval turnaround time for funds is being shortened and passporting of asean unit trust funds is being offered. currently, six funds have been authorized, and the signatory countries include malaysia, singapore and thailand. the commission is also working to enhance our countrys reputation for best practices, and last year launched, together with the minority shareholder watchdog group, the malaysian code for institutional investors. this sets out broad principles of effective stewardship, including monitoring and engagement with investee companies, and managing conflict of interests. to date, there are six signatories to the code, and i hope to see all of malaysias largest institutional investors sign on. inclusiveness and sustainability are key pillars of our vision for malaysias growth. those two values are embedded in our economic transformation programme and are at the core of our 11th malaysia plan, which will be tabled in parliament next month. the government has long recognized that increasing our national prosperity means nothing if it is not shared. the fruits of our success must be available to all. there are now 1.8 million more jobs. and we recently launched a new national higher education blueprint to ensure that our talented younger generations can compete and succeed at the global level. government-linked companies under the glc transformation program have been key contributors to the nations economic growth and development over the past 10 years. over this period, total shareholder return of the g20 u2013the group of glcs which comprises some of malaysias largest companies u2013 grew 12.6 per cent per annum, market capitalisation increased 3.2 times to 431 billion ringgit, while net profit grew 10.2 percent per annum.u200e g20 has invested 154 billion ringgit into the malaysian economy, and have internationalised their presence, drawing 34 per cent of their revenue from abroad and operating in at least 42 countries. these achievements have benefited all stakeholders, with g20 returning 108 billion ringgit in dividends and 64 billion ringgit in taxes since 2004 beyond the financial numbers, glcs have played a major role in nation-building and in the strategic execution of economic structural change, as laid out in the new economic model. glcs are also professionalising the bumiputera empowerment agenda by implementing various initiatives in a market-friendly, merit-based and transparent manner. the glcs are on-track to successfully graduate from the 10-year glc transformation program this year, and i have been informed that to mark the occasion, a glc open day will be held for the public in early august. the completion of the glc transformation programme notwithstanding, we can all look forward to glcs continuing as a major engine of economic growth for the nation. at the same time, we must take care of those in need and those with middle incomes who could still benefit from a helping hand. we have been developing affordable, high-quality housing and have opened 1malaysia clinics and shops so that healthcare and basic necessities are available to all. we are carefully targeting subsidy delivery, so that we can empower the less fortunate. this is why we have introduced direct cash transfers u2013 or br1m u2013 as a transitional measure. it is a measure that has been used in many other countries, and ensures that the money goes to those who need it most, rather than blanket subsidies. the recipients use it to buy necessities, which not only benefits them, but also has a local multiplier effect and contributes to our economic growth. alternatives to improve the countrys finances have been tried u2013 such as the state rescuing selected companies. but these moves in previous decades led to the loss of billions of ringgit. we prefer a more prudent approach, one that benefits the ordinary people. and so we are also delighted that more and more of our citizens are enjoying the safety and security of being included in the financial system. today, 92 percent of malaysians have access to a bank account, and we have been in the top rank in the world banks getting credit category for six years in a row. all this is in keeping with our strong focus on balancing the development of the capital economy with that of the people economy. let me explain. the capital economy refers to the overall figures, such as those for gdp and per capita growth, capital markets and so on u2013 highly significant measures on which malaysia has been doing very well. success in these areas is good for all malaysians. but such figures can seem remote to the rakyat when on a day to day basis they may be more concerned with the cost of nasi for the family table, or roti canai from a stall. their priorities are the education their children are receiving at school, their jobs, the opportunities they see available to them, and their quality of life. the people economy is based on the daily lives of the rakyat. and the government regards that as the bedrock of our economic planning u2013 as a successful malaysia is only possible so long as every malaysian is included in our journey to high income status. we are also looking to the future. the working age proportion of our population is currently high, and we want to ensure we make the most of the accompanying youth dividend. but we are preparing now for 2030, when 15 percent of our population is expected to be 60 and above. the economic planning unit will establish an advisory body that will look into how our social security system will be able to meet this challenge in the years to come, and we are strengthening the senior citizen plan to ensure that age does not sideline a community that will still have so much to offer, and whose wisdom and experience will be invaluable for younger generations. i am also aware of the concerns expressed by the public about any future changes to the epf. in just two days of the online consultation process that was recently set up, more than 50,000 malaysians have taken part and given their views. it is already the largest ever public consultation carried out. this government always listens to the views of the rakyat. and it is clear that the vast majority of epf members, while understanding the importance of retirement savings at the age of 60, want the right to use their retirement funds at the age of 55. i want to assure the rakyat that epf members will retain their right to withdraw at the age of 55. the epf will ensure that any new enhancement will only apply to new contributions if members decide to work beyond the age of 55. this strikes a fair balance between the rakyats expectations to their hard-earned money at the age of 55 while protecting them if they retire at the age of 60. so on all fronts, the fight to ensure that all malaysians enjoy the lives and chances we want them to have continues. it will always be a priority for my government. which is why we are very pleased to see that the private sector has increasingly demonstrated awareness of the need to integrate this agenda into their business models. this is not just a matter of altruism. it makes sound financial sense. companies that have made sustainable and inclusive practices part of their strategies u2013 thereby upholding their responsibilities to the environment and to society as a whole - have been able to attract and retain investment from a wider range of sources. this is shown by the remarkable growth in the global sustainable investment market. it rose from 13.3 trillion dollars from 2012 to 21.4 trillion dollars in 2014 u2013 a compound annual growth rate of 27 percent. and it now accounts for more than 30 percent of professionally managed assets. for malaysia, the introduction of islamic finance 30 years ago provided us with a natural platform to embark on sustainable and responsible investment, or sri. malaysias islamic capital market, which recorded an average of 12 percent annual growth over the last five years, currently stands at 1.6 trillion ringgit. it also continues to be the global leader in the sukuk market, accounting for 66 percent of global sukuk issuance and 57 percent of global sukuk outstanding in 2014. and this year malaysia has broken further ground in this market by issuing its fourth global sukuk. this included 1 billion dollars in ten year sukuk, and 0.5 billion dollars in the first ever 30 year sovereign global sukuk. both issues were massively oversubscribed u2013 a true testament to global investors confidence in malaysia. i am also pleased to announce that the employees provident fund has embarked on an initiative to offer a shariah compliant investment option for its members as of 2017. this will create the largest shariah fund of its kind in the world, and will further strengthen malaysias position as a leading islamic financial centre. as such, malaysia is well placed to drive the sustainability agenda further, and in the 2014 budget, i announced initiatives to do just that. in this regard, i am pleased to announce that following the launch of the sri sukuk framework by the securities commission last year, the first malaysian sri sukuk programme of up to 1 billion ringgit has been approved and will be issued by ihsan sukuk, an independent special purpose vehicle with full recourse to khazanah nasional. the proceeds from this programme will be used to fund eligible shariah compliant sri projects, such as education initiatives. this sets the stage for malaysia to not only strengthen its position as the leading global sukuk centre, but also to expand the market for both fundraising and investing by fully integrating the principles of shariah with those of sri. that is not all we have been doing to pursue our agenda of sustainability and inclusivity. at the end of last year, bursa malaysia launched an environmental, social and governance index, which measures, amongst others, efforts in environmental conservation, the impact of social responsibility initiatives on the community, and responsible and ethical decision-making. the esg index provides investors, institutions and fund managers with a transparent way to rate sustainable investments. to-date, 24 companies have qualified to be included in the index, and i strongly encourage more to enhance their operations so that they can meet the criteria necessary to join as well. again, this makes financial as well as ethical sense, as we see that globally, institutional investors are focusing more and more on sustainable companies and instruments. i am delighted to be able to underscore our commitment to this agenda today, by announcing that the securities commission has approved valuecaps esg fund which, with a total fund size of 1 billion ringgit, will be launched by june this year. to further build on this commitment, i urge other institutional funds to follow suit and allocate at least 5 percent of their assets under management for sustainable and responsible investment. one of malaysias many strengths is its mix of ethnicities, cultures, and religions. but to ensure that we make the most of our rich diversity, our workforce must reflect the composition of the population. so as of this year, public limited companies will be required to disclose their diversity policies, including those relating to gender, age and ethnicity, in the workplace and on their boards. institutional investors are increasing investing based on sustainability and diversity considerations. therefore public listed companies that show more diversity are likely to attract greater institutional investment over time. in terms of gender, the government has taken many steps to encourage female participation in the workforce. we have funded training programmes for women to become entrepreneurs and company directors. we recently launched a career comeback grant which will provide incentives to employers to recruit women who have been on career breaks for more than six months. and we have provided tax deductions for employer-sponsored childcare centres, and are actively encouraging more businesses to set them up. it is not only the chinese who know that women hold up half the sky. so i welcomed the 2011 securities commissions corporate governance blueprint that stated the ambition that women would make up 30 percent of company board members by 2016. we are making progress. i am pleased to note that in the capital market, women have taken up 19 percent of directorships in licensed firms, such as investment banks, stockbrokers and fund management companies. however, at the plc level, women currently make up on only 10 per cent of board members. i strongly encourage the private sector to intensify their efforts, as we know that diverse boardrooms are good for business. 2015 will be an historic year for asean, as we declare the establishment of the economic community, the next stop in our progress together as a region. as asean chair 2015, malaysias goals will be to achieve greater economic, political and social integration, thereby ensuring that we take full advantage of the opportunities our over u2013 600 million strong population offers. malaysia is the right country to lead u2013 and we have already demonstrated our leadership. there are more home-grown asean multinationals in malaysia than in any other country in the region. three of aseans top ten investment banks call malaysia home, and cimb, one of your hosts today, is one of asias biggest home-grown capital market players. bursa malaysia, your other host, was a key driver and founding signatory of the asean exchanges, a collaboration between seven stock exchanges which is driving cross-border harmonization, promoting the region and increasing capital flow into our markets. with a combined gdp set to reach 4 trillion dollars by 2020, asean will play an increasingly significant role in the global economy. in fact asean is expected to become the worlds fourth largest economy by 2050, if not before. we have the third largest labour force in the world, after china and india, and our young and increasingly well-educated populations are among the most dynamic and innovative people you could meet. as trade and tariff barriers reduce within asean it will be our goal to ensure that non-tariff areas of cooperation remain competitive, and that the asean markets see ever-greater increases in their exports. here at home, we are committed to ensuring that malaysia remains one of the most open and transparent marketplaces for both asean and global investors. but further cooperation and integration within asean itself promises still greater prizes. at the asean cap 10 ceo summit in kuala lumpur this february, one of our bank ceos predicted that if intra-asean trade was boosted from 24 percent to 40 percent u2013 and if nafta and the eu have done that and more, why shouldnt we? - the incremental impact on the asean economy could be 2.5 trillion dollars annually, with a further 7 trillion dollars spending on infrastructure improving both our competitiveness and the lives of our citizens. these are astonishing figures, and they underline just how much more can be achieved in our region. as i have outlined, we want these rewards to be enjoyed by all, in line with our vision of a people-centred asean that stresses sustainability and inclusivity. but they can be shared too by investors and businesses from around the world. this is aseans time. and with malaysias centuries-long history of international trade and role as one of the founders of asean, we are poised to lead the region towards realizing the great potential that is within our grasp. i am delighted to welcome you all to invest malaysia 2015, and invite you to join with us in seizing this day: a day for asean, a day for malaysia; a day for the malaysian people, and for all our friends from across the continents. thank you.

[as for the] private sector, we dont know if it will be a smooth ride. but it is certainly something we want to put our money into because of the potential. according to munirah, the potential lies in having a discerning investing public. even with the aec, investors will continue to choose consistent portfolio managers and fund houses with good track records.\n[for example, we have] a full-fledged investment team who speak the local language, study the local companies and get firsthand news from local regulators, she says. we are a bottom-up stock picker, which is something a lot of companies do. but [the fact that we are] close to the ground is very advantageous. in anticipation of the aec, the securities commission malaysia announced on feb 28 that cimb-principal and maybank asset management sdn bhd had received approval to launch funds under the asean qualifying collective investment scheme. cimb-principal, which was the first to receive approval, launched the cimb-principal asean total return fund earlier this month. the fund targets a return of 9% over the medium to long term by investing in companies with above average growth potential. the fund is suitable for investors with a moderate risk profile. the minimum initial investment is rm500 or us$200. we expect to see rm300 million in sales, says munirah. maybank asset managements maybank bosera greater china asean equity-i is an islamic fund. it is a collaborative effort between maybank asset management and hong kong-based bosera asset management. the two companies announced at the end of last year that they would be looking to launch a fund in the first quarter of this year that will invest in shariah-compliant equities and equity-related securities with a focus on asean and the greater china region. the companies share the belief that while hong kong can leverage malaysias islamic fund management capabilities, malaysia stands to benefit from hong kongs strength as an international financial centre. the move is expected to promote the asean-greater china strategic partnership and build on the bilateral trade between the two regions. it was also announced that the monetary authority of singapore (mas) had approved three other funds  maybank asset management singapore pte ltds maybank asian equity fund and maybank asian income fund as well as nikko asset management asia ltds singapore dividend equity fund. how will malaysian investors feel about the liberalisation of the market? munirah believes local investors will embrace it as many of them already have diversified investment options beyond malaysia. today, a typical malaysian investor will have malaysian assets and liabilities to fund. but increasingly, they also have us dollar, british pound or australian dollar liabilities, she says, adding that a liberalised market should be a natural fit for this type of investors because they have exposure to foreign currencies and want exposure in different markets. malaysia is probably ready for more funds to come to our shores. but investors may have to be quite careful with unfamiliar names, she says. munirah is a strong advocate of good customer service. as products become more homogenous these days, there is no way players can compete on pricing alone, she says. hence, it is important for a fund house to have that local touch so that the customer experience can be enhanced. we are culturally more sensitive to the markets we are in, she adds. for a regional player like maybank, the next step would be to enhance its presence in the right market. its presence as the only asean bank in all 10 asean countries is an advantage. since the group has strong balance sheets, lee says it is always looking to grow its footprint and will consider inorganic growth for its private banking segment. as we speak, we are rolling out [our] regional premier wealth platform targeting the mass affluent. we will target indonesia in our wealth management space. it will be a key market for us, given the sheer size of its population, he adds. we will also target the philippines. the literacy rate there is very high, so the scope for economic growth is tremendous. in the last 10 years, we have seen its gross domestic product grow north of 5% consistently. politically, it is a lot more stable than before. also, we will definitely target malaysia and singapore. maybank has the ability to collaborate across business sectors and borders. people are willing to share best practices and come together for the betterment of the group. cambodia, laos, myanmar and vietnam are not high on maybanks priority list as the level of affluence in these countries is not on a par with the rest of asean. despite being the fourth largest bank in the region in terms of assets, maybank is not one to rest on its laurels. since wealth management is about scale, lee says the group aims to gain critical mass. when you have enough customers and aum, you can support a bigger specialist and sales team, which is quite important for us. we want to be a fairly significant player within a short time frame. so, with maybanks rich client base, that will be easy to achieve over time. dbs bank ltd and ocbc bank of singapore are the largest wealth management players in asean. dbs aum stands at us$54 billion and will surpass us$88 billion with the acquisition of societe generals asian operations. ocbc currently has us$46 billion under management. comparatively, maybanks private wealth arm, launched 1u00bd years ago, has us$4.2 billion under management. the group, however, is not underestimating the competition from outside the banking arena. it is not just banks we are competing with, but also non-banks, like family offices, independent financial advisers and even internet companies, such as alibaba, have started providing money-management services that are traditionally offered by banks under the supervision of central banks, says lee. it is going to be a challenging landscape as it becomes more crowded. the bank that can bring sustained values to clients will survive longer.\n  this article first appeared in personal wealth, a section of the edge malaysia, on march 30 - april 5, 2015.

[but] at 3% to 4% yield, they are steady but not excellent. investors can get that with many other sectors, he added. in an april 2 note, alliancedbs research had conservatively assumed a 3% effective increase in prepaid revenue for the mobile players as it thinks that usage might be slightly impacted due to price inflation in the economy. this had previously led to an earnings upgrade of about 2% to 5% for the mobile players in financial year 2015 (fy15) and fy16, said alliancedbs research. maybank ib researchs analyst tan chi wei, who has an overweight call on malaysian telcos, in a note on the same day also assumed that operators would enjoy the equivalent of a 3% pass-through in service taxes in its earnings forecast. both research houses noted that digi.com bhd (digi) (fundamental: 1.55;

valuation: 0.9) and umobile sdn bhd customers who reload rm5 and above will be given an additional value which is higher than the 6% gst in the form of free minutes and text messages for three months from april 3. a research analyst with a local bank said that the compromise is good news to telcos as the status quo of higher prices would likely stay at the end of three months. the solution is temporary and helps customers with the transition to higher costs. at the same time, mobile operators will still have the opportunity to pass on the cost of taxes to end users. plus, the additional 6% air time that they give to users may not may not be used by the customers. i think consumption patterns would be largely the same, he said. digi closed unchanged at rm6.33 last friday, with a market capitalisation of rm49.22 billion. maxis was up 1 sen at rm7.18, giving it a market capitalisation of rm53.9 billion. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers. a score of 3 suggests strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. go to www.theedgemarkets.com for more details on a companys financial dashboard.  this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on april 6, 2015."}, "560": {"date_posted": "2/4/2015", "title": "furniture makers post stellar earnings", "article": "  should investment analysts have to pick a sector with good earnings growth, they need look no further than the export-oriented furniture manufacturers. in the recently concluded corporate results reporting season, many furniture makers announced a leap in net profit while the loss-making ones returned to the black. and in view of their improved earnings, some furniture makers are declaring generous dividends. latitude tree holdings bhd (fundamental: 2.5;

what to look out for when investing in green companies.  today, a wealth of indices are available to investors who want to track the performance of sustainable investments. several etfs have been created to reflect the performance of these indices. these indices include the nasdaq clean edge green energy index, which tracks the performance of clean-energy technology manufacturers, distributors and developers. the dow jones sustainability index (djsi), meanwhile, tracks the performance of sustainable companies across the globe. however, not all who have sought to profit from investments in environmentally conscious companies have been rewarded. some green stocks have performed exceedingly well, but others have not. for example, first solar inc  the largest solar panel manufacturer in the us  saw its share price fall from us$168.22 on feb 18, 2011, to us$60.04 on march 16 this year.  during the same period, its competitor sunpower corp saw its share price double to us$31.94, while that of denmarks vestas wind systems  the worlds largest manufacturer of wind turbines  rose from dkk172.3 in early 2011 to dkk283.60 on march 16. mutual funds have also delivered varying performances against the broader us equity markets. the shelton green alpha fund, one of the newer funds in the us, returned 51.92% over the past two years, compared with the s&p 500s 32.84%. the green century balanced fund delivered a slightly lower return than its benchmark  10.29% compared with the custom balanced indexs 10.94% in the five years ended december 2014. not many of these funds have been well received in malaysia. for instance, three funds that specifically catered to green investors have been liquidated. these are the hwang environmental opportunities fund, the cimb-principal climate change equity fund and the amglobal climate change fund. launched in 2007, these funds fed into target funds in foreign markets, but suffered losses of between 20% and 45% before shutting down. like those of conventional stocks, the share prices of green stocks are driven by various factors. the recent plunge in crude oil prices sent solar stocks tumbling in the us, amid concerns that cheaper fossil fuel would result in lower demand for renewable energy. however, according to a january report by deutsche bank, the outlook for solar panel manufacturers is expected to be intact, as oil represents only 5% of global electricity production and the high solar demand from the us is expected to offset weakening demand from the uk and japan. electricity generated by wind power is expected to be cheaper than that generated by natural gas within a decade, according to the us energy department in a recent announcement. according to its march report, it is estimated that wind power can displace more than 12.3 gigatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, which will save up to an estimated us$400 billion in damages to the environment. this, however, does not necessarily translate into better prospects for solar and wind companies. while solar panel manufacturing is expensive, costs will decrease over time, says loic dujardin, director of research products at sustainalytics, a global research firm that specialises in sustainability and sri. china is currently the worlds largest solar market. this is largely due to the governments subsidies, which were introduced to encourage solar panel exports. the solar sector is very closely tied to government backing. therefore, when investing in solar panel manufacturers, one should look at companies that are less dependent on government subsidies, says dujardin. government support is important for these two sectors because solar and wind energy companies usually sell the electricity generated to those governments. you have to consider the feed-in tariff rates that the government will be paying these companies for the electricity, and this depends on [the governments] support for the green sectors, says jeanette

stocks are also typically lower than in other sectors. these businesses are also rather capital intensive. however, most infrastructure stocks will give you stable and predictable returns  they typically give single-digit yields, she adds. the water utility sector is set to become more important in green investing in the face of water shortages around the world. according to a january report by bank of america merrill lynch (boaml), demand for water is set to increase 40% come 2030. brazil and california are currently coping with severe droughts. boaml forecasts demand for water energy to double by 2035. in my opinion, the water treatment sector is the most promising because the world is facing a waterissue, says dujardin. in asia-pacific countries such as china, indonesia and india, water is the number one challenge. if you dont have enough water, your economy will collapse. companies that are involved in water treatment or the manufacture of water filters will benefit more, he adds. in china, we see that this generation of people are putting pressure on their government because they want safer and cleaner water. water is a long-term investment story. dujardin says investors can look at such stocks as dual-listed french energy and utility company veolia environnement sa and singapores hyflux ltd, which specialises in water treatment. like conventional shares, green stocks are not immune to volatility and sentiment-driven demand. recently, the stocks of environmentally friendly chinese companies saw a surge in prices following the release of a documentary on the air pollution in china. some stocks jumped as much as 32% and approached the daily trading limit, according to news reports. jabusch warns that this volatility is to be expected. many of [these green companies] rely on technology, and therefore are volatile in the short term. i would say to anyone considering an investment in any of my portfolios that they need to have the long term in mind, he says. ultimately, the prices of green stocks are driven by the fundamentals of a company. corston-smiths shireen says that at the end of the day, earnings delivery is what drives all stocks, green or not. investors will have to look at green stocks the way they look at conventional stocks, which is the strength of their balance sheet, revenue generation and cash flow. [how these companies] develop technological advances will be one of the key areas that improve margins. like any stock, a green companys share price is driven in the short term by news about its prospects. but over the long term, its prices are driven by the actual value of its business, or its book value, says jabusch. for sustainalytics dujardin, the ongoing environmental challenges mean that more governments will be forced to look at more eco-friendly solutions to deal with worsening the situation. we are going to face more environmental issues, and now we see that governments are starting to tackle them. we will eventually see a shift in consumer behaviour. i think this will be good for green stocks. for green companies in the energy sector, it is important to see where they are in the competitive cycle in terms of technology and cost, says shireen. if there are tax incentives by governments to support their demand, and if the green energy initiatives are physically and operationally possible, then investors who are in it for the long term should be looking at these sectors.  this article first appeared inpersonal wealth, a section ofthe edge malaysia, on march 23 - 29, 2015.

karex announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary karex industries sdn bhd had entered into a sale and purchase agreement with tropical produce company (pte) limited for the purchase of two pieces of land measuring approximately 4.6ha for a total cash consideration of rm14.8 million. this will take three months to complete and it will be financed by the proceeds from a private placement exercise that was completed on march 11, 2015. in march karex placed out 40.5 million new shares which represent 10% of its paid-up capital. the company intends to utilise the proceeds of rm158 million mainly for business expansion purposes. karexs existing manufacturing plants in pontian are currently located on the land to be acquired. since 2004, the company has been leasing the land and paying an annual rental of approximately rm376,800 for its manufacturing and warehousing operations. as the tenancy agreement will expire on oct 31 this year, the group is now taking the opportunity to acquire the land to prevent any interruptions to its operations or the non-renewal of the tenancy agreement by the lessor. with this land purchase, karex may also not need to relocate its existing manufacturing facilities to the new plant in pontian that will be completed by june 2015. this will give karex more room to increase its capacity to cater to future condom demand. funding is not an issue as this purchase will be fully funded using the proceeds from the recent private placement. we advise investors to stay on the sidelines. the share price has appreciated by 58% since our upgrade on aug 11, 2014, and we believe that this has already factored in karexs strong earnings growth and the stock is now fully valued. while the company is looking to acquire another company in addition to global protection corp (one brand), we believe that the positive earnings impact on its bottom line will not be substantial as the target company will most likely be a smallish company with strong growth potential. although it is penetrating into new markets via one brand, material earnings contribution will not filter through so soon as it takes time for karex to grow its sales in a new market. we also cut our financial year 2015 (fy15) to fy17 earnings per share forecasts by 7% to 8%, taking into account the dilution effect of the recent private placement. we also tweak our capital

development bhds (1mdb) power assets under edra global energy bhd as it plans to proceed with the listing of the business on bursa malaysia. in a statement yesterday, the mof said edra remains focused on and is proceeding with its plans to submit an application for a listing on bursa. this (listing) remains the preferred course of action for the monetisation of these assets, and all relevant stakeholders are committed to ensuring its success. in light of the above, the mof has advised cimb group holdings bhd that its services are no longer required, the treasury added. deutsche bank ag and malayan banking bhd are advising edra on this transaction. in a separate statement, cimb (fundamental: 1.05; valuation: 1.5) said it had been informed by the mof that the ministry had decided not to consider a sale of edra to strategic investors. as such, cimbs services as adviser to the potential sale are no longer required, it added. the change of plans comes only a week after the countrys second largest lender by assets announced on march 26 that it had received a letter of appointment to act as adviser to the mof for the potential sale of edra to strategic investors. cimbs role will include identifying potential buyers and running a competitive process for edra to derive an optimal outcome for the mof. this appointment does not extend to any other area relating to 1mdb, it said then. following the earlier announcement on cimbs appointment, opposition lawmakers had come out to say that selling off 1mdbs power assets would not be sufficient to rescue the debt-ridden strategic investment fund from its cash flow problems. 1mdbs energy assets, although overpriced, are, unfortunately, the only assets which generate revenue and are profit-making. once disposed of, there will be nothing left which generates revenue and profit to repay the balance of the rm30 billion besides its rm7.1 billion of real estate, dap national publicity director tony pua said on march 28, adding that the move would only partially reduce 1mdbs rm42 billion debt burden. on march 12, second finance minister datuk seri ahmad husni hanadzlah told parliament that the government was hoping that the initial public offering (ipo) of 1mdbs energy arm would be able to pay for the companys growing debts amounting to rm13 billion debt in the energy sector. once the ipo is carried out, expected to be done by september as part of the consolidation efforts undertaken by 1mdb, the cash flow problem is expected to be addressed. this is on top of the other options including monetisation through the selling of its assets (land). the other option includes joint-venture initiatives, ahmad husni said. the proposed ipo of edra has been delayed several times due to a longer-than-expected due diligence process and debt refinancing negotiations. according to documents viewed by the edge weekly, the original plan was that edras parent 1mdb, would offer for sale 1.1 billion shares in the energy outfit at rm1.83 apiece, which would garner the strategic investment fund some rm2 billion. meanwhile, edra itself would issue in excess of three billion new shares, raising close to rm5.5 billion for the company. in total, some 4.81 billion shares were expected to be sold in the ipo, which at rm1.83 apiece, works out to rm8.81 billion, the edge weekly reported in december last year. initial indications were that 1mdb would retain only 20% of edra, with the bulk of the funds it obtained from the ipo to be used to repay its borrowings. cimb shares closed two sen higher at rm6.24 yesterday,

profits", "article": " as expected, cimb group holdings bhd turned in one of its worst quarterly performances in the fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2014. the countrys second largest banking group saw its net profit plunge 81% year on year to rm200.3 million, largely due to higher corporate banking loan impairments in indonesia and malaysia. allowance for impairment losses on loans, advances and financing almost tripled to rm919.2 million from rm308.5 million a year ago. revenue dropped marginally by 3% y-o-y to rm3.67 billion while net return on equity (roe) stood at 0.64%. from an roe perspective, it was the worst quarter for cimb (fundamental: 1.35; valuation: 2.1), its newly confirmed group chief executive tengku datuk zafrul aziz acknowledged at the results briefing for reporters late last friday. for the full year, cimbs net profit slumped 31.6% to rm3.1 billion from rm4.54 billion a year earlier. allowance for impairment losses on loans, advances and financing jumped to rm1.52 billion from rm660.6 million a year ago. the groups annualised fy2014 roe was 9.2%  a stark contrast to the 15.5% achieved a year earlier  while its cost-to-income ratio increased to 59.1% from 58.2% before. cimb proposed a dividend of five sen per share for the quarter versus 11 sen in the same quarter a year earlier. zafrul said the group is targeting for roe to improve to 11% this year and for its cost-to-income ratio to come down to 55%. asked whether the heavy provisioning will continue, he said: there will be some for 1q2015 but it wont be as bad as for 4qfy2014. zafrul, who expects asset quality to normalise after the first quarter of this year, described fy2014 as a difficult year for the group with profitability impacted by slower revenue and a sharp increase in provisions. this was partially exacerbated by the weakened rupiah. capital markets continued to be challenged by low volumes and volatility, which affected the investment banking and treasury market operations. however, we remain heartened by the positive performances of the malaysian consumer bank and cimb bank singapore while cimb thai is showing operational traction, he added. zafrul also shared at the press briefing that cimb cut 150 jobs due to the closure of its australia and north asian business. this represents a single-digit percentage cut of its investment banking workforce. when asked if there were more job cuts in the pipeline, he said it would depend on the review done based on the groups new t18 strategic mid-term plan. zafrul said wholesale banking would still remain the groups focus, albeit to a lesser extent, given that margins in the segment have become compressed. he added that by 2018, cimb wants the consumer banking segment to contribute 60% to the groups income. in fy2014, this segment contributed 52.8% to the groups profit before tax while wholesale banking contributed 34.6%. the remaining 12.7% came from investments. on feb 6, cimb outlined its new t18 plan and key organisational changes with a mid-term target of achieving an roe of 15%, common equity tier 1 ratio of over 11%, cost-to-income ratio of below 50% and 60% consumer banking income contribution by end-2018. with the lower 4qfy2014 earnings, cimb has seen y-o-y earnings drop for the last seven quarters since the quarter ended june 30, 2013. the expectation is that its financial results will continue to be weak until at least the quarter ending march 31, 2015. a major contributing factor to cimbs disappointing earnings is its exposure to the indonesian market through pt bank cimb niaga. in 2014, cimb niaga saw its net profit fall 45.3% y-o-y to idr2.3 trillion on the back of provisions rising sharply by 188% y-o-y to idr3.5 trillion. its consolidated gross non-performing loan (npl) ratio had surged to 3.9% by the end of last year from 2.23% in 2013. zafrul believes indonesia will turn around. loan growth there is still strong u2026 in the high teens, he pointed out. banking analysts were not surprised by the results as cimbs management had already guided that the group would unveil a weak quarter. earnings were dented by the lacklustre capital market performance and higher provisions. moving forward, i think they will see cautious growth. one of the key things for them to get back on their feet is how good their cost initiatives are and how well they can execute their plans, says a local banking analyst.  another analyst opines that it was good for the group to conduct a kitchen-sinking exercise last year, referring to the sharp provisioning. lower the base and keep some buffer for 2015, he remarks. despite cimbs bad set of numbers, bharat joshi, head of investments at pt aberdeen asset management, says there were pockets of positivity. if you look at the consumer business of cimb, it maintained its momentum quietly. stripping out the rest of the business, the malaysian consumer business held up pretty well while the singapore consumer business did a lot better in 2014. the consolidated results were hampered by the wholesale business, which is the treasury market, corporate banking and investment banking, he tells the edge. the only surprising bit has been the steep increase in provisioning. hopefully, management can get a handle on asset quality going forward. all eyes will be on how they rein in asset quality. the saving grace, going into 2015, is the banks strong capital position. it is a lot stronger. this should help the banking group beat off some headwinds and concentrate on the actual work of cost-cutting and restructuring the business. as at dec 31, 2014, cimbs cet1 ratio stood at 10.1%, improving from 8% a year ago. meanwhile, both malayan banking bhd and rhb capital bhd, which also released their results last week, saw earnings climb in fy2014 in contrast to cimb. maybank saw its net profit rise marginally by 3% y-o-y to rm6.72 billion while rhbcaps full-year net profit jumped 11.5% to rm2.04 billion. maybanks roe for fy2014 was 13.6% while rhbcaps was 11.5%. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on

"title": "will flymojo threaten existing airlines yields?", "article": " kuala lumpur: malaysian skies will soon see the addition of new start-up flymojos colours as the full service carrier, which will operate out of the senai airport in johor and the kota kinabalu airport in sabah, is slated to start operations in october 2015. but cimb research analyst gan jian bo is sounding alarm bells over the likelihood that existing airlines yields  already under pressure after consumers were spooked by the spate of aircraft disasters in this region  would be compressed further due to overcapacity when flymojo comes on board. the new airline, operated by fly mojo sdn bhd, signed a letter of intent last tuesday with canadas bombardier commercial aircraft to purchase 20 sc100 aircraft for us$1.47 billion (rm5.45 billion), with an option for another 20, which would up the value of the deal to us$2.94 billion. it plans to fly under-served routes. this year should have been one of capacity rationalisation for the aviation sector, led by malaysian airline system bhd (mas), which is undergoing restructuring and cutting unprofitable routes, and airasia bhds decision to renegotiate slower delivery of some of its new aircraft while it diverts its extra capacity to associates based overseas, he told the edge financial daily. so we were hoping that yields for airlines would improve because of that. but with a new player expected to come onstream this year, it puts that hope for capacity rationalisation at risk, said gan. he pointed out that malaysias aviation space is also expected to see additional capacity from indonesias lion air group. lion airs subsidiaries  thai lion air and malindo air  are mulling the expansion of their fleet with 21 new b373-800s in 2015. he also noted that between wings air  another lion air subsidiary  and malindo, there may be another addition of a dozen atr-600 turboprops. gan said low-cost carrier group airasia (fundamental: 0.2; valuation: 0.6) took a hit to its earnings after new players entered the cut-throat aviation market previously, citing malindo airs introduction in march 2013 as a prime example. in a report dated march 18, cimb research highlighted how airasia saw its revenue per unit of available seat kilometres (rask) decline  and it has not recovered  since malindos first flight. rask stood at 16.42 sen in the fourth quarter of 2012 [4q12], but was 16% lower at 13.73 sen in 4q14. although airasia attempted to increase yields in 4q14, passengers were spoilt for choice in an environment of overcapacity, resulting in a 6% drop in load factor and very minimal rask improvement, it said. based on airasias experience alone, gan said no one should dismiss flymojos potential impact on the local aviation sector. furthermore, he expects flymojos routes to overlap with airasias as demand for a premium service on non-trunk routes is limited. currently, airasia has 15% of its seat capacity allocated to kota kinabalu and 7% to johor baru. ambank research analyst hafriz hezry harihodin, however, said the additional capacity that will come with flymojo will not be sufficient to rock the boat. even after full delivery of flymojos 20 aircraft, itll just account for well below 10% of existing capacity. bear in mind that this incremental capacity from flymojo will only trickle into the system over a number of years, hafriz said. further, he said, there is a distinction between the introduction of flymojo and malindo air. hence, he is not overly concerned over pressure on ticket prices and yields. in the case of malindo air, it was competing head on with incumbent airlines at the kuala lumpur international airport. this, in turn, triggered aggressiveness from mas, which happened to be running its fleet at extremely low utilisation back then. naturally, there was a massive ramp-up in capacity outlay to compete. given that mas had a sizeable capacity, airasia reacted and hence a price war broke out. the dynamics between the entry of flymojo and malindo air are very different, hafriz said. flymojo, he pointed out, is planning to operate as a full-service airline as it saw that lowering fares in low-cost territories had proven to be unsustainable. the airline intends to position itself between a hybrid and premium full-service product, as this paper reported, quoting fly mojo managing director datuk janardhanan gopala krishnan, on march 18. we are finalising the routes, which will determine the kind of products that we will roll out. but definitely [the airline] will not be a low-cost or super-premium. it will be closer to a full-service carrier, he had said. hafriz said a new airline would usually offer discounted fares initially to create awareness of its brand and gain traffic, and that some mild pressure on fares can be expected, but that this would be specific to routes it will undertake at the hubs it will operate from. even so, flymojos capacity is still extremely small to trigger a big reaction from incumbents, especially since it is operating from secondary hubs. the fact that it is using a smaller aircraft suggests it may focus on niche markets rather than entering into full-blown competition for major routes, he added. whether flymojo poses any real threat to other airlines or not will depend on its routes  which are yet to be announced  and its future growth plans. but, for now at least, it appears that consumers and airport operators are the only clear gainers as air travel choices expand and air traffic grows. the edge

interest rate cuts and accommodative monetary policies by central banks globally are flushing the market with ample liquidity or hot money. however, the current flow of hot money seems to have eluded the malaysian equity market for now, which is traditionally more resilient, in favour of other riskier markets that could potentially offer better returns. despite net inflows of u$13 billion into major asian markets this year, foreign investors have continued dumping malaysian equities, just as hope was rising that the net purchase observed in the week following the chinese new year could be sustainable, says zulkifli hamzah, head of research of midf amanah investment bank, in a march 9 note. the outflow of foreign funds has been noticeably strong since the beginning of the year, with overseas investors being net sellers in the local market except for two out of the first 10 weeks of the year as at march 6. this amounts to some rm3.41 billion in cumulative net outflows, or half of last years total net outflows of rm6.93 billion. conversely, local institutional funds have been net buyers in eight out of the past 10 weeks, which suggests a significant absorption of the outflows. as at march 6, institutions have been net purchasers of rm3.72 billion worth of local equities. on the macro front, asian equities have seen more interest as the european central bank (ecb) began its u$66 billion-a-month bond buying programme last week, which saw the regions bond yields plummeting to record lows and prompting investors to look for higher yielding asset classes elsewhere. in spite of growing interest in asian equities, the ftse bursa malaysia kuala lumpur composite index (fbm klci) is currently one of the worst performing among major asian indices year to date. hampered by the weak ringgit and weak oil prices, the malaysian equity market has faced immense pressure, in contrast to stock indexes in indonesia and the philippines that have recently recorded fresh highs. after an encouraging start to the year, the fbm klci has shed gains over the past two weeks, as the latest earnings reporting season came to a close with largely uninspiring results seen in the fourth quarter of 2014.  since peaking at a three-month high of 1,825.54 points on march 4, the fbm klci fell to as low as 1,770 points on march 11. it closed at 1,786.87 points last thursday. corporate earnings among fbm klcis constituent stocks saw marginal growth of 0.1% in earnings per share (eps) on a year-on-year basis, after factoring in their full year earnings, according to cimb research in a recent note (see chart). the earnings decline began during the second quarter of last year, which coincided with falling oil prices as well as a significant weakening in the ringgit, cimb notes. the flattish earnings growth may give investors cause for concern. as at march 12, the fbm klci only gained 2.8% this year, well below emerging market peers such as the philippines and indonesia with gains of 9% and 6% respectively to date. while the fbm klci has a reputation for lower volatility due to the strong institutional support, some say this is no longer the priority of yield-hungry investors. malaysia is facing a problem in terms of perception as well as fundamentals. the gst implementation and lower oil prices are big factors that could lead to subdued economic growth and have negative ramifications on corporate earnings prospects. foreign investors are now turning to indonesia or india, where the growth story remains intact, says the head of research of a foreign-owned investment bank based in kuala lumpur. another notable development is that the central banks of china, indonesia, india and thailand have cut interest rates over the past two months, which prompted fresh interest in their stock markets. in contrast, bank negara malaysia maintained its benchmark rate of 3.25% this month after a hike of 25 basis points in july last year. the central bank had commented on march 11 that the current rate is supportive of growth and is in line with current inflation expectations. economists say bank negara is unlikely to cut the interest rate due to the weak ringgit, which has been asias worst-performing currency over the past six months. with so much uncertainty and market speculation, a popular question among foreign investors was the direction of malaysias interest rates, given that other countries have been lowering rates. we believe the key policy rate will remain unchanged as bank negara seems concerned about the risks of destabilising financial imbalances and rising inflationary pressure from the goods and services tax implementation, says affin hwang capital head of research ong boon leong. at present levels, the fbm klci fetches a valuation of 16.5 times earnings, compared with consensus expectation of around 15 times earnings at end-2015. according to bloomberg data, the fbm klcis dividend yield for 2015 is projected to be 3.2%, the lowest level in six years. the bearish tone is reflected by the forecasted year-end level for the fbm klci by the major research houses (see table). the majority of the estimates peg the index at between 1,800 and 1,850 points, implying a modest upside of just 3.5% from its march 12 close of 1,786.87 points. the end of the earnings reporting season means less scope for potential market catalysts going forward. the market will be hard pressed to find reasons to justify a reversal (from the current downtrend), says midfs zulkifli hamzah.  this article first appeared in the edge

more than 55% of the employees provident funds gross investment income  it allocates over 40% of its rm600 billion asset base to stock markets in malaysia and overseas. just five years ago, its allocation and income from equities were about 27% to 28%. meanwhile, 68% of its funds were invested in government debt papers and highly rated corporate loans that brought in slightly over two-thirds of the total gross investment income it used for dividend payment. today, more than half of the epfs assets are still in these highly rated debt papers, but returns have fallen below 40% due to yield compression. that the 6.75% dividend the retirement fund declared for 2014 was 3.59% above inflation  as well as more than double the 12-month fixed deposit rate of 3.21% and well above the 3.84% yield for five-year malaysian government securities  is a testament to the reallocation in recent years. the dividend for 2014 is also up for a sixth straight year compared with 4.5% in 2008 and 5.65% in 2009 when rm100.43 billion (27.05% of its asset base) was invested in equities versus rm269.63 billion (42.35%) last year. income from equities has grown even stronger from rm4.9 billion (28.37% of total gross investment income) to rm22.91 billion (58.63%) last year. some observers are concerned that the epf  tasked with growing retirement savings for malaysias private wage earners  could be hit should the equities market take a sudden turn. but ceo datuk shahril ridza ridzuan says short-term price volatility does not matter to long-term value investors like the fund because the intrinsic value of the shares does not change with the price fluctuation. the job of the epf is actually to find value, the right assets or stocks that are underpriced on a long-term view because we believe prices will eventually reflect their value. were not a short-term investor, shahril tells the edge. the epf had some rm146.4 billion, or 23% of its rm636.53 billion investment asset base as at end-2014, in overseas assets but does not give a breakdown of how much of it is in foreign equities. nonetheless, shahril says the epfs top foreign stock holdings are blue chips. partly to allay concerns over the rise in its equities investment, the retirement fund makes a quarterly disclosure of its top 30 holdings of local equities on its website. these were estimated to be worth rm111.61 billion as at end-2014, being 41.4% of the rm269.63 billion the epf had invested in local and foreign equities at the end of last year. the same top 30 holdings would be worth a little more at about rm114.3 billion using feb 16, 2015, prices. to illustrate the funds dominance in the local market, the estimated size of its top 30 equities holdings was 6.76% of bursa malaysias total market capitalisation of rm1.65 trillion as at dec 31, 2014. its entire fund size of rm636.5 billion is over 37% of bursas total market capitalisation of rm1.71 trillion currently. given its size and the returns the epf has generated from equities, its investment moves might be worth watching. the fund does not comment on individual equity investments. among other things, the fund is believed to have been relatively early in exiting its investment in malaysian airline system bhd (mas). as at end-march 2010, about the time mas announced plans for a rm3.05 billion one-for-one rights issue, the epf had a 13.66% stake in the airline and this was its 25th largest equity investment by percentage holdings. by september the same year, the stake had fallen to 13% and by december 2010, mas was no longer among the funds top 30 equity holdings. on hindsight, that saved it from having to fork out more money when the national carrier announced its third rights issue in five years in november 2012 that sought to raise rm3 billion. however, not all its holdings have performed well. its investment in shell refining co (federation of malaya) bhd, for instance, has fallen in value. closing at rm5.45 apiece on feb 16, shells share price has slipped from rm8.25 as at end-2012 and rm6.36 as at end-2013, but has recovered from the rm4.69 seen at end-2014. the epf has been slowly paring its holdings in shell, from 17.02% at end-2012 to 16.75% at end-2013 and 16.55% at end-2014. latest filings show that the epf had 16.49% equity interest as at feb 11, 2015. fortunately, while shell is shown as number four on the epfs top 30 equity holdings as at end-2014, the value of the stake is relatively small at only rm233 million. in terms of the value of the shares on the funds top 30 holdings as at end-2014, its most valuable stake was its 13.32% in malayan banking bhd, followed closely by its 14.37% in tenaga nasional bhd and 14.7% in public bank bhd. each of these holdings are worth over rm10 billion. a closer look at the disclosures found that during 2014, the funds largest equity holding increases were at telekom malaysia bhd (up 3.11% to 14.73% as at end-2014), tenaga (up 2.01% to 14.37%), ijm corp bhd (up 2.46% to 13.02%), pos malaysia bhd (up 2.13% to 11.53%) and capitamalls malaysia trust (up 2.18% to 11.25%) (see table). apart from pos malaysia, whose shares fell 14.08% year on year in 2014, the other four stocks all ended the year between 8.84% and 29.04% higher, with telekom being the best performer. interestingly, the epf chose to reduce some of its holdings in another telecoms counter, digi.com bhd, by 1.12% to 13.27% at end-2014, even as it raised its equity in telekom. over the same 12-month period, among the epfs larger stake sales were ijm plantations bhd (down 3.52% to 12.04% as at end-2014), petronas gas bhd (down 1.47% to 12%), mbm resources bhd (down 1.4% to 14.46%), cimb group holdings bhd (down 1.28% to 14.6%) and petronas chemicals group bhd (down 1.28% to 11%). four of the five stocks that the epf sold saw their respective share prices fall between 5.46% and 25% while shares of ijm plantations rose 3.92% for the year. but the year-on-year gains may not be reflective of the epfs gains or losses given that its entry and exit costs could differ from the stocks general trend for 2014. time will tell if investors can profit from tracking the epfs moves, but it may be worth putting stock in the ceos perspective that price fluctuations do not change the real value of the shares.  this article first appeared in the

boon for medical tourists to malaysia, its impact on listed private hospital operators, namely ihh healthcare bhd and kpj healthcare bhd, is seen to be muted. ihh healthcare (fundamental: 1.65; valuation: 1.5) operates a network of hospitals with key operations in malaysia, singapore and turkey, while kpj healthcare (fundamental: 0.65; valuation: 1.5) is a private healthcare provider with hospitals primarily in malaysia and indonesia. in its 2015 asia-pacific healthcare outlook report released on jan 22, frost & sullivan said malaysian healthcare players should see the weakening ringgit as an opportunity to project the countrys image as a destination for medical tourism. the consulting firm says local hospital operators should take advantage of the political unrest in thailand as well as the strengthening of the singapore dollar, which has made the city-state a very expensive destination for medical tourism. frost & sullivan asia-pacific senior vice-president of healthcare rhenu bhuller tells the edge that malaysia tends to attract medical tourists who are more cost-conscious. hence, if the quality of the medical services provided is highlighted internationally, the country could attract such patients seeking elective medical procedures or who have to pay out of pocket, she explains. bhuller, however, says if the hospitals purchase significant amounts of medical products and services in us dollars, their net profit could be impacted. since last september, the ringgit has fallen 13.6% against the greenback due to concerns over the governments financial position as crude oil prices fell. malaysia derives a third of its revenue from oil and gas. meanwhile, research analysts who track ihh healthcare and kpj healthcare expect the impact of the weaker ringgit on the healthcare providers to be muted. amresearch analyst max koh says given the 4.72% decline in the ringgit against the singapore dollar since last september, it is possible that singaporeans will come to malaysia for treatment. we understand that there has been a moderation in indonesian patients going to singapore, given the strengthening singapore dollar as well as the growing [healthcare] sector in indonesia, he adds. koh says ihh healthcare will benefit from the stronger singapore dollar as its revenue is denominated in ringgit, but it will be mitigated by the weakening lira (currency of turkey). thus, he expects the net impact to be neutral. in financial year ended dec 31, 2013 (fy2013) ihh healthcare generated revenue of rm6.756 billion. its singapore business contributed 36% of the groups revenue, while malaysia made up 20%. central eastern europe, the middle east and north africa accounted for 38%. as for kpj healthcare, he does not foresee much impact from the depreciating ringgit as most of its operations are domestic. cimb research analyst saw xiao jun concurs, saying that a weaker ringgit will, in theory, make medical tourism more attractive, as it may lower the cost of healthcare for foreigners. however, the implementation of the goods and services tax (gst) in april might just offset the impact of the weaker ringgit as medical inflation is expected to be higher this year. according to a rhb research report, drugs and medicines not listed under the national essential medicines list will be subject to gst. a lot of the medical tourists in malaysia come from indonesia and the middle east. the indonesian rupee has also depreciated against the us dollar while the purchasing power of patients from the middle east could be affected by lower crude oil prices, says saw. he adds that the weakened ringgit should not affect the earnings of kpj healthcare significantly, as medical tourists contribute less than 10% of the groups revenue. there is no way to quantify the impact of the weakened ringgit as hospitals in malaysia charge local and foreign patients the same rates. [but] we dont expect a spike in the volume of medical tourists this year, he says. bhuller estimates that on average, medical tourists make up less than 20% of the current patient load in malaysia. medical tourism is one of the areas of focus and growth, [with] the bulk of patients going to most private hospitals being locals or expatriates living in countries like malaysia or singapore, she says. according to statistics compiled by the malaysian healthcare travel council (mhtc), healthcare travellers in malaysia more than doubled in 2013 from 2009. the data shows the number of healthcare travellers increasing for four consecutive years, rising to 770,134 in 2013 from 336,225 in 2009. on jan 30, the international medical travel journal reported that penang captured half of the total medical tourist arrivals in 2014. health deputy minister datuk seri dr hilmi yahya reportedly said that daily, 1,000 foreign patients enter private hospitals in penang for medical treatment last year. the ministry figures put medical tourism revenue at rm594 million in 2012 and rm690 million in 2013. the forecast for 2014 is rm700 million. mhtc has set up the mhtc concierge, a one-stop-centre that provides medical travellers with easy access to all the information needed in order to have a comfortable and fruitful stay in malaysia, at the penang international airport, which serves most major airlines and connects with all major cities in southeast asia. ihh healthcare and kpj healthcare have a presence  through pantai hospital penang and kpj penang specialist hospital respectively  in penang. currently, ihh healthcare has at least nine mhtc-registered medical providers, including gleneagles kuala lumpur, and pantai hospitals in cheras, batu pahat and ayer keroh. meanwhile, kpj healthcare has 11 participating institutions, including kpj specialist hospitals in kajang, klang, ipoh and johor. cimb researchs saw has a hold call on kpj healthcare with a target price of rm4.10. he says the company has good long-term prospects due to the rising demand for healthcare in malaysia, but its near-term earnings may not be exciting due to its aggressive expansion plans. among the hospitals slated to open this year are kpj specialist hospital bandar dato onn and kpj perlis specialist hospital. amresearchs koh also has a hold rating on kpj healthcare with a target price of rm3.68, as he deems the stock to be fully valued at the current price. kpjs expansion plans are on track but we expect margins to be flattish [or possibly see some pressure moving forward] as it would typically take new hospitals two to three years to break even, he says.  note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers. a score of 3 suggests strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. go to www.theedgemarkets.com for more details on a companys financial dashboard. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on february 9 -

below our and consensus expectations, at 93% of our forecast.the weaker-than-expected results were due to the weak fourth quarter (4q) sales, depreciation of the ringgit against the us dollar at the end of the year, and higher advertising and promotion (a&p) spending. the slight improvement in fy14 top-line was driven by domestic sales, but the bottom line was dragged by the higher raw material and a&p costs in the first half of fy14 (1hfy14). given the lower-than-expected fy14 results, we cut our fy15 to fy16 earnings per share forecasts by 7% to 11%. our discounted cash flow-based tp is reduced accordingly. we downgrade the stock from add to hold. nestle declared a final single-tier dividend per share (dps) of rm1.75, bringing total fy14 dps to rm2.35. we prefer ql resources bhd. nestles fy14 revenue rose by a slight 0.4% but net profit inched down 2% year-on-year (y-o-y). the slightly stronger top-line was driven by solid domestic sales, which offset the weak performance of the export business. in the domestic market, nestles confectionery, liquid drinks and ice cream segments registered solid sales growth. in spite of the better top-line growth y-o-y, fy14 net profit was lower y-o-y, mainly due to the higher raw material price in the 1hfy14 and a&p costs (to boost sales). while the prices of commodities started to ease in the the third quarter of fy14 (3qfy14), this was offset by the depreciation of the ringgit against the us dollar. we also believe that nestles fy14 top-line was negatively affected by the east coast floods in dec 2014 and the later timing of chinese new year festival in 2015 (feb 18) compared with 2014 (jan 31). the higher operating costs caused the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation margin to drop 0.2% points y-o-y in fy14. the 4qfy14 performance was softer y-o-y. in comparison with 4qfy13, the 4qfy14 revenue dropped 2.6% and net profit declined 2.1%. exports to affiliated companies showed some improvement quarter-on-quarter but declined y-o-y. in spite of the lower sales and higher cost of goods sold due to the appreciation of the us dollar against the ringgit, 4qfy14 net profit declined y-o-y by a lesser degree than top-line, thanks to internal cost savings and the lower effective tax rate. while we had expected nestle to be affected by the slower spending, we did not foresee that its sales would be impacted this severely. in view of the weaker-than-expected results, we downgrade the stock from add to hold. nestles share price has appreciated by 10.7% since july 21, 2014. we

make it mandatory for employers to do their foreign worker work permit renewal (fwpr) online as opposed to having the option to do so over the counter before. although myeg (fundamental: 2.6; valuation: 1.5) has been offering its foreign maid work permit renewal service since 2011 and extended it to foreign workers in labour-intensive industries in 2013, the latest directive has effectively made it the sole company at which work permits for foreigners can be renewed. concerns have been raised over the rm38 per transaction fee imposed on the service on top of the rm125 processing fee, the timing of the announcement and also how the company is seen as monopolising the market. myeg managing director wong thean soon tells the edge in an email that the rm38 fee was set and approved by the government after lengthy negotiations. of course, there are those who print 1,000 copies in [the] klang valley, but there are also users who renew one permit in some remote plantation in pahang. we have to look at it in totality, says wong, adding that myegs scope of work is extensive and not just limited to printing out permits. the additional fee is necessary for our work and responsibilities since it is our only source of income. myeg will not be receiving any additional payment from the government for its service from the rm125 processing fee that is to be paid by employers to the home ministry for work permit renewal. since jan 5, the immigration department has expanded myegs fwpr service to include identifying legal foreign workers and employers who knowingly or unknowingly hire illegal workers, and providing a convenient and efficient way to renew work permits. according to the companys announcement to bursa malaysia, it will capture digital biometrics of the employers and their representatives and analytics will be conducted on the data to generate trends that show the cause of the proliferation of illegal foreign workers and why some employers have a disproportionate number of foreign workers running away. some quarters recently slammed myeg for monopolising the market and violating the competition act 2010. but wong points out that the existing government database has been outsourced to many other it companies. would it make a difference if the delivery of the permits and verification of the employers were done by other companies? finally, it is the governments decision that the end-to-end process is done by us to ensure that we are fully accountable for all aspects, wong says, adding that all centralised databases must be built by one party and that all the data is owned by the government. when asked about the timing of the add-on service, he explains that this is within its e-government concession agreement signed in 2000, in which the company has supplementary agreements with other ministries to offer them its services. this implementation was always part of the plan, right from the beginning, and we have been notified a number of times about different implementation dates. if we had to make an announcement each time we were notified of an implementation date, we would have to make a high number of subsequent notifications of postponements, which would have been even more misleading to investors. myegs added service will enable it to tap the two million foreign workers in the country. excluding sabah and sarawak, which have their own set of immigration laws, wong says there are 1.5 million foreign workers in peninsular malaysia that will help myeg generate rm57 million in revenue per annum. in its first quarter ended sept 30 (1qfy2015), net profit rose to rm12.04 million from rm8.56 million in the previous corresponding period. revenue was higher too, growing to rm27.72

fy2013. the increase in earnings was attributed to higher volumes of online fwpr, online transfer of vehicle ownership and online renewal of insurance and road tax. there was also a higher contribution to revenue from ancillary services related to its e-government services. in a recent note, cimb research says myegs earnings growth is strong  at 71% its three-year earnings per share

13): with the nations key oil exports falling and budget cuts coming, malaysia still had consumer spending as a prop for growth late last year. that pillar may be weakening, escalating the risks for a middle-income economy that expanded an average 5.8 percent in the past half decade. measures of manufacturing wages and credit-card spending are the weakest since at least the global financial crisis, according to inflation-adjusted data compiled by bloomberg. malaysias currency, the worst performer against the dollar in asia in the past three months, is already lumbering under concerns foreign investors will pull out their money as the federal reserve prepares to raise u.s. interest rates. prospects for weaker growth threaten to add to the gloom. malaysia needs a reality check, said chua hak bin, a singapore-based economist at bank of america merrill lynch. in the past, consumer spending has held up so well that it could buffer any surprises on the exports side, but this time i suspect consumers may be in for a rougher ride. consumer sentiment is deteriorating, even with fuel and electricity costs now falling in the southeast asian nation. malaysians had seen prices of essential items from sugar to gasoline climb in recent years as prime minister najib razak curbed subsidies to improve state finances, and are now bracing for a new goods and services tax that will start in april. more expensive things are getting a bit more expensive, says juliana alwi, a 50-year-old housewife who says her husbands salary isnt growing much. while shopping for groceries this week in a kuala lumpur mall, she said she will stop buying clothes that arent essential, and shift to less expensive make-up brands. subdued wage growth, job cuts at some state-owned companies, elevated household debt and stricter access to credit are restraining domestic spending, chua said. the ringgit fell 0.1 percent to 3.6045 a dollar in kuala lumpur yesterday, even after a report showed economic growth unexpectedly accelerated last quarter. its fallen more than 7 percent in the past three months, the worst performer among 11 major asian currencies tracked by bloomberg. malaysia, along with indonesia, has the lowest reading in the bloomberg brief domestic demand barometer in southeast asia, according to tamara henderson, an economist with bloomberg intelligence. these economies have higher sensitivity to oil-price movements, she said in a january report. malaysia has scope to underperform owing to a much larger deterioration in real wages. spending trackers malaysias manufacturing wages, adjusted for inflation, fell more than 2 percent in december from a year earlier, the biggest decline since september 2009, while credit card balances fell every month in 2014, the longest slump since at least 2006, data compiled by bloomberg shows. the two measures have tracked consumption patterns, history shows. consumer confidence fell to the lowest level in a year last quarter, an index by the malaysian institute of economic research showed. that may curb the private consumption that helped the economy expand 5.8 percent last quarter from a year earlier. after sentiment slid to an almost five-year low in the final quarter of 2013, private consumption growth eased in the next six months. for now, consumer spending has been held up by healthy economic growth of the past few years, bonus payments, government handouts to the poor and festive spending ahead of the chinese new year celebration this month, said tan hai hsin, managing director of retail group malaysia, a consulting firm. malaysians are also front loading purchases before the new tax in april, he said. growth driver domestic demand will remain as the key driver of growth, malaysias central bank said jan. 28. while private consumption is expected to moderate, it will remain supported by the steady rise in income and employment, and the additional disposable income from the lower oil prices. aeon co. (m) bhd., the malaysian unit of the japanese retailer, has fallen 24 percent over the past six months. the benchmark stock index has fallen more than 3 percent in the same period. the greatest challenge in 2015 for the retail industry in malaysia is consumers spending, said tan of retail group, citing the new tax and cutting his industry sales forecast for this year to 5.5 percent from 6 percent. for the six-month period after april 2015, retail sales will likely slow down. rate increases interest-rate swaps show traders have lowered their expectations for an increase in borrowing costs in the next year. consumer spending and investments are still expanding albeit just at a slower pace, said julia goh, an economist at cimb group holdings bhd. in kuala lumpur. policy makers will have to make some tough decisions to ensure that growth is supported, inflation is manageable and shoring up confidence in the ringgit. malaysians like lee chau shiang are choosing the path of austerity for now. i am spending a lot less nowadays, said lee, 28, who worries the april tax will hurt his video production business and is saddled with loan payments for his car, motorcycle and home that sap almost 70 percent of its monthly income of about 4,000 ringgit ($1,118). i seldom think about nice dinners anymore.

restructuring exercise, better-than-expected new sales and continuous landbanking. the share price of eco world went ex for the one-into-two share split, which reduces the par value of the stock to 50

valuation: 0.6) prior to the takeover announcement. but integraxs single largest shareholder amin halim rasip, who holds a 22.81% stake, last friday rejected tnbs bid, stating that the takeover was unfair and unreasonable. perak corp bhd (fundamental: 1.90; valuation: 1.2) holds another 15.74% in integrax, while tnb itself owns 22.12% of the port operator. tnb could make a better offer but the question is how much would be enough? even if tnb does not make a better offer, we think that it would still end up with a controlling stake in integrax, said cimb research in a note yesterday. cimb research analyst faisal syed ahmad said tnb need not raise its offer price to convince the shareholders of integrax (amin in particular) to part with the company. the current offer price values integrax at 20 times historical price-to-earnings (p/e), which is a bit steep, as we have highlighted before. valuations aside, amins reluctance may be prompted by his aim of securing a deal from vale international sa, he added. if this is the case, amin may not sell at any price, faisal said. and, therefore, tnb (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1) upping its offer would not make a difference, he pointed out. if tnb does make a better offer, we would be neutral, as we believe that tnb is very keen to secure control of integrax for strategic purposes. on the flip side, if tnb decides to maintain its current offer, it could still end up with 60% of integrax (excluding amin and perak corp), which would give it more control over the company than the other parties, said cimb research. it added that this majority stake may be enough for tnb to steer the direction of integrax in order to meet its own strategic targets. the current takeover offer would cost tnb rm644.23 million, of which several research houses said was already at a decent premium and advised minority shareholders to take the offer. it has been reported that tnb wants integrax to focus on handling the coal shipment for its power plants near the latters lekir bulk terminal (lbt), while amin intends to broaden its client base. a minority shareholder of integrax said the offer price, which is based solely on net asset per share or discounted cash flow valuation based on existing contracts, does not do justice to the minority shareholders. integrax ought to be valued on a more holistic approach on the basis of revised net asset value taking into consideration the replacement cost of its facilities. even the unused stockyard is worth a lot of money, the minority shareholder told the edge financial daily, adding that theres also rm154.6 million cash reserves sitting in integrax, which has negligible debt. and then theres the m5 coal handling services contract (with tnb) which should be signed soon. who knows with the delays in completion of the two coal-fired power plants, 1malaysia development bhds 2,000mw jimah power plant and tanjung bins power plant expansion, tnbs janamanjung power plant (in perak) may need to plant up more capacity to pick up the slack, the minority shareholder added. integrax owns two terminals with an 80% stake in lbt and 50% less one share in lumut maritime terminal. tnb is integraxs only customer at lbt (90% to 95% utilisation rate), which facilitates the import of coal for its power plants. nevertheless, another analyst said tnb does not have to pay more than it is currently offering as the amount is already at a premium. more so, tnb is the only customer of integrax in lbt. if it fails to gain control of integrax, tnb can always build its own port in the same vicinity, without relying on the former, said the analyst. tenaga could use the rm644.23 million to build its own port instead, the analyst said. shares of integrax yesterday closed 1 sen or 0.36% lower at rm2.74, while perak corp shares also closed 3 sen or 1.05% lower at rm2.82. tnbs share price settled 12 sen or 0.83% higher at rm14.50. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers. a score of 3 suggests strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. gotowww.theedgemarkets.comfor more details on a companys financial dashboard. this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on january 20, 2015."}, "583": {"date_posted": "16/1/2015", "title": "bursa queries ifca on share price, volume rise", "article": " kuala lumpur (jan 16): bursa malaysia has issued an unusual market activity (uma) query on ifca msc bhd following the recent rise in the latter's share price and volume, according to a statement on the bourse regulator bursa's website. it software entity ifca's (fundamental score: 3;

on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few

intermediate low was seen at 1,671.82 on dec 17. as expected, the 2014 year-end window dressing short-term rebound phase was pyrrhic in nature and stalled at 1,770.52 (dec 30). the fbm klci index then traded between that 1,770.52 high and the recent 1,706.18 low. all the indexs daily signals have turned positive (except oscillator) recently. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at the 1,671, 1,706 and 1,738 levels while the resistance areas of 1,745, 1,770 and 1,858 will cap any index rebound. the fbm klcis 18 and 40 simple moving averages (smas) depict a neutral trend for its daily chart. however, the 50 and 200 smas have also issued a dead cross and the index prices remain below these two longer-term smas. due to the volatile tone for the fbm klci index, we are recommending a chart sell on tambun resources bhd. tambun released their third quarter financial year 2014 (3qfy14) results at the end of november 2014 and will announce their 4qfy14 results in february 2015. further to the 3qfy14 results announcement, revenue rose by 20.3% year-on-year while profit before tax increased by 11.5%. the better profitability was attributed to the property development segment as a result of increase in billings and higher take-up rates as well as better percentage of project completions. overall, the positive fundamental for tambun appears to have been factored into the share price. despite the higher profitability, investors continued to sell the stock recently. the weaker investor sentiment can be seen across the property sector as many property analysts expect property transaction volumes to decline. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that four research houses have coverage on tambun, with two houses having buy calls and another two hold calls. this stock currently trades at a low price-earnings ratio of 6.3 times while its price-to-book value ratio of 1.84 times indicates that its share price is trading at a steep premium to its book value. return on equity is rather high at 30% while its pre-tax margin stands at 31.3%. tambuns chart trend on the daily and weekly time frames is very firmly down. its share price made a large decline since its major daily wave-5 all-time high of rm2.62 in september 2014. since that rm2.62 high, tambun fell to its december 2014 recent low of rm1.40. as prices broke below its recent key critical support levels of rm2 and rm1.77, look to sell tambun on any rebounds to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to medium-term downtrends for this stock. the daily and weekly indicators (like the cci, dmi and oscillator) have issued sell signals and now depict very firm indications of tambuns eventual move towards much lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm1.58, rm1.77 and rm2. we expect tambun to witness weak buying interest at its support levels of rm1.40, rm1.47 and rm1.55. its downside targets are

discussions of the mega-merger between cimb group holdings bhd, rhb capital bhd (rhbcap) and malaysian building society bhd (mbsb) had been called off on wednesday. a bank-backed analyst told the edge financial daily that while most banking stocks saw gains, this was most likely a spillover effect from investors buying into cimbs stock. but it remains to be seen if this would be a rerating catalyst for the sector. another analyst who declined to be named said the rebound in cimbs share price spoke for itself, when asked if the news was positive. the banking groups shares rose 14.9% from a one-year low of rm5.18 as at jan 12, 2015. cimb (fundamental: 1.35; valuation: 2.1) was one of the most actively traded stocks yesterday, gaining 16 sen or 2.78% to close at rm5.91 and rhbcap

yesterday, fitch ratings said the move to call off the exercise reflected prudence on cimbs part, amid a weakening operating and economic environment resulting in slower growth and banking sector asset quality pressures. the ratings agency deemed the merger as ambitious, as the process would have been lengthy and the inclusion of mbsb into the mix would have made the integration even more challenging given its different business mix to cimb and rhbcap. fitch noted that the macroeconomic outlook for malaysia has grown less certain amid the recent sharp falls in the price of crude oil as the country is a net oil exporter. mbsbs focus on higher-risk personal unsecured lending  one of the areas most sensitive to a weaker environment  would have raised the risk profile of the new entity had the merger gone through, even though we believe the malaysian banks are well placed to meet the challenges with strong loss absorption buffers, it added. affin hwang research analyst tan ei leen said she still sees provisioning risks for cimb, due to headwinds from indonesia and also for rhbcap due to a below industry impaired loan cover. she said now that the mega-merger has been called off, the question remains as to whether other banks would be interested in a merger as well. we maintain our neutral rating on the malaysian banking sector given concerns of cascading macro risks on the economy from 4q14 (fourth quarter of 2014) to 2q15, she said in a note. meanwhile, ram rating services bhd has lifted the positive rating watch on the rhb groups banking entities, mbsb and rhb-guaranteed debt issues. concurrently, we have reinstated the stable outlook on their ratings, it said. the positive rating outlook on rhbcaps debt facilities has also been reinstated on account of the anticipated improvement in its gearing and double-leverage ratios, it added.  the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on

that we mentioned a week ago at 1,765 points. furthermore, the index is still below the ichimoku cloud indicator. a break above the immediate resistance level could change the bearish indication. most momentum indicators such as the rsi and momentum oscillator have rebounded to its middle levels. this is another indication of a possible reversal. furthermore, the fbm klci has climbed above the middle band of the bollinger bands indicator. therefore, the momentum indicators are also at a crossroads. the index is either going to climb higher and break above the immediate resistance level or the bears may take the opportunity of the current rebound to start selling again. we expect the index to test the immediate resistance level at 1,765 points this week. at the moment, it is still best to remain cautious and not to be too anxious about the current rebound. there is not much improvement on the market sentiment, unless the index can break and stay above the immediate resistance level. failure to break above this level would send the index back to test the immediate support level at 1,710 points. fundamentally, falling crude oil prices and a weakening ringgit may still weigh down

lumpur (jan 14): malaysias dream of forming an islamic megabank to accelerate industry development remains just that. a three-way merger that would have created a lender with the financial clout to win bigger sukuk deals against the likes of hsbc holdings plc and standard chartered plc has stalled as tumbling oil prices wreak havoc on the economy. the planned amalgamation of cimb group holdings bhd., rhb capital bhd. and malaysia building society bhd. would have been the nations largest ever m&a transaction. central bank governor zeti akhtar aziz first raised the idea of an islamic finance megabank more than five years ago to better compete for business in the persian gulf and cement malaysias position as a shariah-compliant hub. a license slated to be awarded in 2011 for a multinational lender to be formed between asia and the middle east didnt materialize, depriving the $1.7 trillion global industry of a growth engine. this is a dampener on the development of islamic finance and its reach into the global market, mohamed azahari kamil, chief executive officer at asian finance bank bhd. in kuala lumpur, said by phone yesterday. i dont think there will be another merger for a while as current market conditions arent conducive. cimbs board will meet today to discuss the merger, according to a stock exchange filing from the bank issued late yesterday. the parties are still in discussions, according to a rhb statement. regional integration while cimb has topped the sukuk underwriter rankings in malaysia for the past eight years, hsbc has held the title in the middle east since 2009. as the nations second-largest lender, cimb arranged a total of 18.3 billion ringgit ($5.1 billion) in deals in 2014 when overall sales reached 62 billion ringgit, data compiled by bloomberg show. europes biggest bank managed $2.5 billion, down from $5.5 billion in 2013 and $9 billion in 2012. the islamic development bank was seeking partners in 2012 to bring in $1 billion in investment to form a megabank. the financial institution, which was to be established with riyadh- based dallah albaraka group and the qatari government, planned to issue islamic bonds that lenders could buy to manage excess funds, jeddah, saudi arabia-based idb president ahmad mohamed ali said in a may interview that year. that plan also didnt come to fruition. the cimb-rhb merger, first announced in october, would have created a group with total assets of 637.9 billion ringgit, surpassing the 612 billion ringgit of the nations biggest lender malayan banking bhd., according to data compiled by bloomberg. the new entity would have become southeast asias fourth-largest bank, behind singapores dbs group holdings ltd., oversea-chinese banking corp. and united overseas bank ltd. success doubts terms for the deal no longer make sense as the industry outlook worsens, people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because deliberations are private, said yesterday. an official announcement could come as soon as this week, one person said. failure to create a mega shariah bank isnt a major setback for the islamic finance industry, according to investment advisory company prometheus capital finance ltd. whenever something like a megabank is forced into creation, im not so sure that itll be so successful, thomas christie, the head of fixed income at prometheus, said by phone from dubai yesterday. the main problem is more the integration between the gulf market and the more developed malaysian market. however, its not going to dissuade people from looking for other ways to integrate the two regions. malaysia is feeling the pinch from plunging oil prices that have sent the ringgit to its weakest level since 2009. a subsequent drop in revenue for asias only major oil exporter may make it more difficult for the government to achieve its target of cutting the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product this year from 3.5 percent. budget review a major support for the currency may also be removed should the current-account surplus slip into deficit. the excess was 7.6 billion ringgit in the third quarter, already the smallest since june 2013. brent crude has fallen 57 percent in six months to its lowest level since 2009. malaysia may review the 2015 budget to take into account the impact of the decline in oil, according to a report yesterday from state news agency bernama, citing prime minister najib razak. a statement is due next week, it said. the establishment of a megabank for the global islamic finance industry would help remove a major impediment to growth as investors say there arent enough products, particularly sukuk, to meet demand. ernst & young llp estimates shariah- compliant banking assets will double by 2018. shares rally stock market investors seem to have taken a positive view on the breakdown of the bank merger. cimb shares ended the day 14 percent higher, compared with a 0.8 percent gain in the benchmark ftse bursa malaysia klci index. rhb climbed 0.9 percent. malaysia building society lost 5.9 percent as it wont get access to a broader loans and mortgage market. the creation of a mega islamic bank isnt critical to malaysias islamic finance industry at the moment, even though the prospect is enticing, suhaimi zainul-abidin, treasurer of the gulf asia shariah compliant investments association, said in an e-mail from singapore yesterday. it should happen as a matter of course as the market matures, and it is important that the creation of such a megabank makes commercial sense for all the parties involved.

yes, that is possible, but that depends on the regulator (bank negara malaysia). i think for foreign investors in banks, that is always their ultimate aim u2026 to increase their shareholding. australia-based anz, which emerged as a strategic partner in ammb back in may 2007, also has a 39% stake in indonesias pt bank pan indonesia tbk (bank panin), for which it has reportedly hired an investment bank to look for buyers. apart from that, anz has a 20% stake in shanghai rural commercial bank co ltd and 17.6% in bank of tianjin co ltd, among others. merger with maybank? azman says ammb is fully focused on trying to improve its performance and is stepping up efforts to gain market share in the competitive marketplace. the malaysia-focused group is not distracted by the recent merger developments in the industry, he insists. we are pushing forward on our strengths. we have spent a lot of effort and made substantial investments in impressing our capabilities [over the last two years] and are ready to go faster. but as the operating landscape gets tougher and with banks starting to consolidate to build size and venture into overseas markets, can ammb continue to go it alone or will it join the consolidation game? analysts say should azman and anz be looking to give up their stakes, top lender malayan banking bhd (maybank) is likely to be interested. apart from being seen as one of the better fits for ammb, maybank also has an additional reason to seek a merger  it will lose its long-held position as the countrys largest banking group by assets if the cimb-rhb-mbsb merger comes to fruition. maybank ceo datuk abdul farid alias has nevertheless said it will not acquire another bank just to maintain its top spot, pointing out that any acquisition must enhance its shareholder value. azman, when asked what he thinks about a potential maybank-ammb pairing, says: at the moment, no thoughts about that. he laughs good-naturedly when it is suggested that it would be a homecoming of sorts for him if there were to be such a merger, given that it was in maybank that he had his start in banking (see side story). maybank ran into some turbulence in the late 1960s and bank negara put azman, a chartered accountant, there as a non-executive director for about five years to help sort out its problems. he was eventually made an executive director in 1971. i was there 10 years, from 1971 to 1980. that was during the most formative years. it was the first local bank to introduce computer systems u2026 it was a big deal, you know (laughs). i was the one who initiated the competition for the design of the head office building. many branches opened. we started the merchant bank  aseambankers, in those days, we started the insurance company, credit cards. so interesting. the growth was fantastic. i really enjoyed it. it gave me the exposure, experience and confidence to run my own bank [later], he recalls. for sentimental reasons, would he be keen on a maybank-ammb merger? at the moment, im just looking at making the bank [ammb] perform better, he answers. driving force azman founded arab-malaysian merchant bank bhd in 1976. he then built it into what is now known as ambank group. he has been the driving force behind the groups successes over the years. its 38-year journey, however, was not without headwinds. azman recalls the lowest point in his career, when the banking group was nearly swallowed up by the affin group due to the governments move to consolidate banks during the 1997/98 financial crisis. the bank was hit. this was because two years before that, we finally got the last part [that we needed to become a] financial supermarket  we bought a commercial bank, at market price as per all our acquisitions. after we bought it, we had to make sure we were making money out of it u2026 so we dished out loans, mostly corporate loans. [and the] worst-hit sector during the crisis was corporate loans. that was the worst time. the banks share price nosedived to about rm1 from between rm24 and rm26 a share. azman was hit not just as a banker but also as an entrepreneur and borrower. imagine what happened to me. all my assets went out the window. all the banks were very hard. some foreign banks were hard and rude u2026 the way they treated people was very bad. so, i can understand how borrowers feel when they are hard-pressed. and of course u2026 the part that was really bad was when under the banks consolidation, we were supposed to be swallowed up by affin bank. just imagine, ambank would have disappeared! but we made a turnaround immediately u2026 so quick u2026 in one year! he says. the group fell into the red, incurring a net loss of rm426.6 million for its financial year ended march 31, 1999. it returned to the black just a year after that, registering a net profit of rm209.3 million in fy2000. it then continued making profits every year except for fy2007 when it incurred a net loss of rm282.5 million due to a significant one-off prudent provisioning charge it made to build up its loan loss coverage for long outstanding non-performing loans. following its escape from being eaten by affin bank in 1997/98, it began strengthening itself to become a solid independent banking player. in 2012, ammb acquired kurnia insurans (m) bhd and mbf cards (m) sdn bhd to support the growth of its non-interest income. today, the group, which once focused mainly on auto financing and investment banking, has evolved into a more diversified universal banking group, with bottom lines crossing the billion-ringgit mark. the entry of anz in 2007 helped boost the groups product base, strengthened its business policies and improved its asset quality. ammbs group managing director, ashok ramamurthy from anz, took over the reins from veteran banker cheah tek kuang in 2012. azman says the group will continue to stay focused on the local market despite its rivals going increasingly regional. thats partly because of the partnership with anz [which already has a regional presence through its stakes in asian lenders]. but there is nothing to stop us from going overseas, for example, in islamic banking and investment banking. the big question is, will azman still be with the group when it ventures into its next stage of growth?  below are excerpts from the interview: the edge: what is your view of the cimb-rhb-mbsb merger that is in the works?tan sri azman hashim: i think its good. if you want to be going regional and have the power and size to be going regional, then you have to have this kind of merger. its good. people have different views on whether the epf should be allowed to have a vote on the merger. your view?\npersonally, i feel the epf should be allowed to vote. the epf is the biggest investor on the stock market and is a substantial shareholder in most of the companies. so, denying it the vote seems unfair. the epf should have the ability to protect its investments. what are your thoughts about the current banking consolidation and in your opinion, how different is it from the previous round?\npreviously, there were 30 over banks. and then consolidation came in 1998/99 and we were supposed to be swallowed by affin bank. i dont understand why. but anyway, thank god and tun mahathir  from an intended six anchor banks it became 10. so, we remained part of the 10. that was the first consolidation exercise. now, we have eight banks, and with this current merger, itll be even less. but let me say this. from the customers point of view, my own experience is that they prefer to have choices. in fact, with too few banks, youll have a problem because for customers, for the businessmen, they have less banks to approach. so, i think, we need to have medium-sized banks also, like us (ambank). you know, during the asian financial crisis of 1997/98, i was much affected personally not just at the bank but more as an entrepreneur and borrower. then, you could see how the banks worked. its the foreign banks  some were terrible. i had experience with two. i was looked down upon and treated rudely. during a crisis like that, their head office just said, cut credit to this and that sector, and it was done ... theres no sentiment and no matter what youre doing to improve, they cut. we are a malaysian bank, and we try to understand the people and circumstances. because i was personally affected, i understood completely what was happening and the situation. many of the reasons for the crisis were beyond our control, caused by foreigners attacking our currency and the stock market. so, we accommodated many of the malaysian companies. you need to have domestic banks, and not too few, because especially in times of crisis, the borrower needs to be able to go to the bank, talk to them face-to-face  this is what we did for others. and many are thankful to us because we took them up during the crisis. so, im not so sure we should have, for example, just three or four large banks. i think theres room for a few of the not-too-bigs. you get too big also, you can get very impersonal ... like international banks. then it becomes difficult to maintain the personal touch, which is important to me. so, in malaysia, there is space for banks like us. down the line, could there be a potential partnership for ambank with another bank?\ni think we have to keep an open mind. i would say id keep an open mind, because the situation changes. well see how it is. in the end, what is good for the bank is what counts. also, the mega merger is not completed. integration is not an easy thing, you know. we also had some exercises integrating with mbf finance, with kurnia insurans. its a big exercise, and we take two to three years at least to settle down, so we have to see what comes up with it. so, the environment might change, the situation might change. in fact, when integration takes place, usually the banks are so involved in it that its difficult for them to really be aggressive in the marketplace. theyre so busy trying to integrate their systems, their people ... we know about the problem. so, this is the time for us to improve our performance and get more market share. with the three banks now busy with the mega merger, is ambank stepping up its efforts to gain market share?\nthat is a normal process. in other words, all the banks do that all the time anyway. but maybe with the integration process going on, were still doing the same thing, but therell be a bit less competition perhaps ...

[thus,] our view is that a 30% tariff hike is the most likely scenario, said the reseach firm. we believe that northports new 15.7% shareholder, mmc corp bhd, is likely to exert [a] positive influence to push the tariff hike through and this will be one of the key catalysts for westports share price this year in our view, cimb research said. westports is in a strong competitive position in port klang, and we expect it to enjoy multiple catalysts to its share price this year, including a likely tariff hike, an increase in transshipment volumes from the start of the ocean three [shipping] alliance, and the high chance of getting a renewal of its investment tax allowance, it noted. cimb research said the ocean three alliance of cma cgm, china shipping and united arab shipping co  westports three largest customers  is on track for implementation from this month onwards. cimb research is maintaining an add recommendation on westports, with a target price of rm4.57. westports

hence, the industry will be impacted by the tax. while the quantum has yet to be determined, we see the costs being passed down the value chain, especially as we do not determine the final price of the product. while we will try to manage our costs as much as possible, the ultimate selling price will be determined at the distributor and retail end of the value chain, says the company in an email reply to questions from the edge.  analysts believe f&n will not be severely affected by gst implementation because its products are relatively cheap, which means consumers need not skimp on them. also, its leading position in the condensed and evaporated milk segment and among some soft drink brands could help ease the impact, they add. i dont think f&n will be severely impacted by gst as stall operators will still need its milk products for their drinks and these arent expensive, says cimb research analyst eing kar mei. an analyst at ta securities believes f&n will see a decline in selling volume but adds that things will be no different for its competitors. currently, f&n is the market leader in malaysia for condensed and evaporated milk, as well as its soft drinks 100plus,

decline as they see no negative events that could have sparked it other than market jitters from oct 8 to 16 when world indices plunged. nevertheless, the stock had rebounded to rm16.68 last

as total industry volume is expected to continue to come under pressure, thanks  or no thanks  to the excise hike last month, which saw cigarette prices increase by rm1.50. rob stanworth, managing director of jt international bhd (jti), which was privatised earlier this year and carries the winston brand, thinks it is too early to tell what impact the recent excise and price increases will have on industry volumes, but admitted that volumes may fall. based on past trends, it would be reasonable to expect volumes to be under pressure following an excise and price increase, especially with the uncertainty of consumer sentiment driven by inflationary pressures as well as illegal cigarette trading, which has been a long prevalent issue in malaysia, he said in an email reply to the edge financial daily. neither jti nor british american tobacco (malaysia) bhd (bat)  the latter is now the only listed tobacco outfit on bursa malaysia  wanted to provide a forecast on the anticipated volume drop, but analysts who track the sector are of the view that tiv will see a contraction of up to 10% this year, and a little more in 2015. tiv has already fallen by 7% for the first nine months of this year. note that following the excise hike in october last year, tiv fell by almost 17% year-on-year in the immediate quarter (4q13). nonetheless, analysts are quick to point out that the higher selling prices are sufficient to offset for any drop in sales volume. indeed, even as most analysts have maintained their reduce and hold calls on bats counter, many have raised their earnings forecast for the stock for financial year 2014 (fy14) to fy16 and increased their target prices following the announcement on the excise and price hikes. one of them is cimb research, which observed in a nov 5 note that while sales volume will most likely drop substantially in the immediate term, we believe it will have a net positive impact on bats fy15 earnings as long as sales volume does not fall more than 16% to 17%, which we think is unlikely. affin hwang investment management bhd head of equity gan eng peng, citing historic precedents, is also not expecting any severe demand destruction for tobacco. in fact, he noted that bat is one of the stocks that have done really well over the years despite constant price increases and tighter government regulation. it has been able to achieve this by passing the high cost of doing business down to its customers, which in this case have proven to be inelastic in terms of their demand, he told the edge financial daily. if better enforcement can be accelerated, there could be a sustained shift of buyers back to the legal market, making bat one of the key beneficiaries, he said. the confederation of malaysian tobacco manufacturers, citing the latest illicit cigarette study conducted by nielsen, said there has been a 6.6% decrease in illegal cigarettes to 32.3% this year from a record high of 38.9% reported at end-2013. this marks the largest decline in the history of illegal cigarettes in malaysia in 20 years. the illicit market has improved, yes, but now, with the price hike, [im] not sure if the government can sustain its efforts. it might [just] go back to square one, opined one analyst. she also thinks that at 32% to 35%, the levels are still very high. areca capital sdn bhd chief executive danny wong cautioned that the goods and services tax (gst) to kick off in april, which may prompt a pick-up in consumption prior to it, will see a slowdown for about six months to a year after its implementation. next year 1q could [still] be okay to look at consumption stocks. but [from] 2q onwards, consumption stocks may be affected and some investors may switch to other stocks, [like those] related to the economic transformation programme, wong said. tobacco will not be impacted that much as its a habit. but in terms of yield, there are many other choices. in a way, it hinges on the countrys interest rate outlook. if inflation stands at a manageable level and we are here to stay, there are other yielders such as reits and banking stocks, he said. based on bats closing share price of rm65.90 yesterday, and fy13s dividend per share of rm2.82, it yields only 4.3%, while the edge research shows that the stock has a 12-month rolling yield of 4.8%. it is also trading at 20 times price-earnings ratio (per), based on its annualised fy14 earnings per share of rm3.34. uob kay hian head of research vincent khoo also envisaged resilient demand within the consumer sector next year, except for tobacco, habits notwithstanding. ... we expect duty-paid cigarette volume to contract by 12% in 2015 following the aggressive excise-driven price hike of 12% to 14% in november 2014, said khoo in a strategy note this month. he favours the brewery subsector instead, which he said has been sold down heavily by more than 30% since its peak in june last year. hence he, as well as a few other analysts, picked carlsberg brewery malaysia bhd  with its higher yield now  as a more attractive sin stock option. positively, the brewery subsector should post moderate volume growth [mid single-digits] thanks to regulators effective anti-contraband efforts, he said, adding that carlsberg is trading at only 18 times forward per, compared with guinness anchor bhds 20 times. based on carlsbergs closing share price of rm11.78 last friday and its fy13 dividend per share of 61 sen, it yields 5.2%.  this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on december 24, 2014."},

vote in the proposed merger of cimb group holdings bhd, rhb capital bhd and malaysia building society bhd (mbsb), sources say. bursas appeals committee was to have met on nov 28 and the epf had been hoping to have a chance to plead its case by making an oral presentation at that meeting, the edge financial daily reported last thursday, citing sources. the meeting was postponed and no new date has been set as yet, one of the sources tells the edge. on oct 21, bursas 10-man listing committee had ruled that the epf cannot have a vote in the mega merger as the pension fund is a common major shareholder in all three financial institutions, giving rise to a potential conflict of interest. it has a 41.5% stake in rhb, 64.6% in mbsb and 14.6% in cimb. on oct 31, however, rhb and mbsb had each, at the epfs behest, submitted an appeal to bursa to reconsider that decision. all this while, the epf had been looking to vote only at the rhb and mbsb level where it has sizeable stakes as the single largest shareholder, sources say. however, it is understood that the epf may now be amenable to abstaining from voting at mbsb. its an option that the epf might look at to address the conflict situation. this could well be what it proposes to bursa if it is allowed an oral hearing [at the appeals committees meeting]. but at the rhb level, it definitely wants to vote, a source says. the source points out that the situation in rhb is unlike that at mbsb, where the epfs controlling 64.6% stake can sway the outcome of a vote. rhb also has other sizeu00adable single shareholders such as abu dhabis aabar investments pjs, which could hold the trump card in a vote with its 21.2% stake if the epf is not allowed to vote. if the epf is allowed to vote in rhb with its 41.5% stake, the merger would be pretty much a done deal, if it is in favour of it. this is because as the acquirer, rhb needs only 50%-plus-one share approval for the deal to go through. the merger has been structured such that rhb will acquire larger rival cimbs assets and liabilities via a share swap, after which their respective islamic banks will merge with mbsb to form a mega islamic bank. at this point, however, analysts and industry players think the epf may just be clutching at straws with its last-ditch attempt to get bursa to change its mind. bursa is unlikely to budge from its earlier stance, they say. questions will be asked if the stock exchange can reverse important decisions just like that and itll set an unhealthy precedent, remarks a banking analyst from a local research firm. while the epf is unlikely to have any fresh reasons for pleading its case, it wants to be allowed to make an oral presentation at the appeals committee meeting, hoping that this would be more effective in convincing bursa than an earlier written representation that it had submitted to the stock exchange operator, a source says. the epf has long argued that the interest of its 14 million contributors is at stake if it is not allowed to vote in the proposed mega merger. epf ceo datuk shahril ridza ridzuan has previously pointed out that it may have to re-look its investment strategies as the epf owns more than 5% interest in over 100 companies and may be caught in a similar situau00adtion in future. clsa research notes that while the epf does not reveal the exact split between local and foreign equity investments, equities constitute the single biggest asset class within its portfolio (43%, up from 39% in 2012) and the institutions presence in the domestic stock market is broadly felt as per its significant shareholdings in almost all listed blue-chip companies. while epf has generally been a passive investor, it is now showing signs of increased activism as per its recent vocal comments that it should be allowed to vote in any potential cimb-rhb-mbsb banking merger scenario, it notes in a nov 28 report. interestingly, cimbs stock has been on a downward trend since the mega merger was announced. its share price recently fell below the rm6 mark, dropping to as low as rm5.74 on nov 21, but recovering to close at rm5.83 last friday. at rm5.83, it is 18.32% lower than cimbs rm7.138 close on july 9 prior to news of the mega merger being announced on july 10. the latest closing price of rm5.83 is also 16.5% lower than the closing price of rm6.98 on oct 8  the day before the structure of the merger was announced. on oct 9, it was officially revealed that rhb would acquire cimb via a share swap at an exchange ratio of 1.38 (1 rhb share for every 1.38 cimb share). this is based on a valuation of rm7.27 per share for cimb and rm10.03 per share for rhb. but while cimbs stock slid, both the stocks of rhb and mbsb rose following the merger announcement on july 10. rhb ended the day higher at rm9.18 on july 11 from its close of rm8.72 on july 9 while mbsb closed at rm2.46 compared with rm2.34 during the same period. mbsb continued to climb to close at rm2.57 last friday. rhb continued on its upward trend and closed at a historic high of rm9.50 on aug 19. it has since come down, partly due to the fall of the stock market in october, to close at rm8.18 last friday. this translates into a 6.2% drop from its close of rm8.72 prior to the news of the merger on july 9. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on december 1 - 7,

banking sector will have to once again forge into what many are seeing as less-than-friendly weather ahead. in fact, 2015 has been described as no less than gloomy, thanks to slower global growth and lower domestic consumption, which is expected to continue to squeeze net interest margins (nims) and stifle loan growth. m&a securities sdn bhd head of research rosnani rasul (pic) did not mince words when she told the edge financial daily recently that things could get worse next year for banks and the industry will simply have to ride out the storm. there will be times whenbankswill prosper and there will be times when they will have to expect smaller growth. i expect that it is the latter next year.there are macroeconomic issues which will affectbanks financial performance next year and they are out ofbankscontrol, said rosnani. cimb research analyst winson ng too expectsbanks underwhelming earnings seen throughout 2014 to continue into the new year, and holds a negative rating on thebankingsector. so far, there appears to be a disconnect between the countrys growth and the banks earnings. the gross domestic product growth seen in the first half of 2014 has not been reflected in thebanks financial results in the last few quarters. this is an industry-specific problem, ng observed. ng forecasts thatbankswill see more moderate loan growth in 2015 from households and businesses due to the effects of the goods and services tax (gst) in april, and higher inflation. he said households will be more cautious in their spending as disposable income shrinks in the light of rising cost of living, and this will suppress household loan growth, which is currently supported by mortgages. but that support wont last for long as the full effects of the governments cooling measures on the property market onbankswill become more evident in 2015. to date, the slowdown in the property market has not translated into weaker growth in mortgages. this is becausebanksare still benefiting from development projects, which have been in the pipeline in the last three years. going forward, softer property transactions will have a stronger impact onbanks loan growth, reasoned ng. uob kay hian head of research vincent khoo, who has a market weight rating on the bankingsector, expects loan growth in 2015 to decline from 7.8% to 8% in 2014 to 7% on the back of moderating household loans, as well as a weak and patchy corporate loan growth recovery. there is also continuous pressure on nims due to more intense competition for loans and deposits. rising funding cost on the back of intense competition for deposits will continue to be one of the biggest challenges forbanksin 2015. this is especially so with the implementation of a net stable funding ratio under basel iii and the 10-year record high system loan to deposit ratio, said khoo. bankswith relatively lower current and savings account ratio and higher loan to deposit ratio are likely to face greater headwinds, both from margin and loan growth perspectives, he said. midf research analyst kelvin ong has a neutral call on the sector but noted that demand for business loans will be impacted by slower export growth due to slower growth in the global economy. as exports grow at a slower pace, we anticipate capital expenditure spending by companies to slow down. this will impact business loan demand. against this backdrop, we expect the sectors loan to grow at a slower pace of 8% to 9% for 2015, as opposed to 9% to 10% for 2014, he said. amresearch also maintained a neutral rating on the sector for next year, citing nim compression as well as credit costs to be major issues of uncertainty for 2015. in a research note dated dec 4, amresearch analyst rachel huang said she had downgraded thebankingsectors net earnings growth assumption to 0.6% for 2015 from 12.6%. in terms of revenue assumptions, sector loan growth assumption has been lowered to 8% from 8.5% previously for next year. like khoo, she expects credit costs to pose a challenge tobanks. she said credit costs may remain relatively high due to sporadic weakness in the corporate segment as well as retrenchment exercises

a one-to-one basis and matures on july 20, 2018, closed at rm2.43 last wednesday, representing a 1.15% discount to the mother share. however, more clarity is necessary as with the disposal of its water assets, puncak niaga will be without a core business and could be classified a cash company and thus given a practice note 17 status. we maintain our hold call on puncak niaga until we see further clarity on the groups future business plans, says amresearch, which has a rm3.40 target price on the stock. puncak niaga intends to use rm1 billion from the sales proceeds for investments that could include an expansion into the oil and gas sector. the proposed sale is expected to be completed in the first quarter of next year. with balance cash proceeds of around rm1 billion, this deal is also positive for puncak niaga as it will allow the group to pursue the expansion of its oil and gas business via m&a at home and overseas, beyond the existing transport and installation contract from petroliam nasional bhd, cimb research says in a nov 12 note. it has an add recommendation and target price of rm4.28. in theory, if puncak niaga rises 23.3% to rm4.28, puncak-wb should be worth 35% more at rm3.28, assuming zero premium to the underlying share.\nthe consensus target price is rm4.33 at the time of writing with 83.3% of analysts recommending a buy and 16.7% a hold. there were no

plantation sector\nmaintain neutral. a survey of 19 malaysian planters conducted by the cimb research futures team revealed that crude palm oil (cpo) production in november probably fell 5% month-on-month (m-o-m) to 1.8 million tonnes. this could be due to seasonal factors and tree stress from the drought experienced in peninsular malaysia in the first quarter of financial year ending 2014. the survey revealed that peninsula estates posted the biggest decline in cpo production (-16% to -6% m-o-m) while sabah may be the best-performing region for output (-9% to +8% m-o-m). malaysian palm oil exports were weak, falling by around 10% m-o-m in november, based on cargo surveyor reports by intertek group plc (-9.8%) and sgs sa (-10.5%). this was due to weaker exports to india, pakistan (lower post-festival demand and competition from other oilseeds) and europe (due to the onset of winter). we have assumed domestic consumption of 294,000 tonnes and imports of 83,000 tonnes in november. based on the above assumptions, we project that palm oil stocks at end-november will rise by 7% m-o-m to 2.3 million tonnes. the malaysian palm oil board (mpob) is set to release the official figures on dec 10. the variance in our survey from actual mpob stock figures since we started producing the monthly stock preview in august has been 0% to 5%. the key takeaway from our survey is the smaller-than-expected drop in output. this, combined with weaker-than-expected exports, is likely to lift the end-november malaysian palm oil inventory to a 21-month high of 2.31 million tonnes. we view this as negative for cpo prices in the short term as it indicates ample stock in the producing palm oil market. malaysian palm oil stocks are likely to fall this month due to the seasonal drop in output while exports are likely to be relatively stable in view of the upcoming chinese new year festivities. our key concern is the recent sharp decline in crude oil prices (brent) to us$72 (rm248) per barrel, which has significantly reduced cpos competitiveness as a source of energy in the form of biodiesel. cpo prices have remained relatively resilient against the fall in crude oil prices so far due to concerns about weaker palm oil output, higher biodiesel mandates and adverse weather effects on key planting areas due to a potential el nino occurence. the australian government bureau of meteorology in its latest update revealed that most climate indicators remain close to el nino thresholds, with climate model outlooks suggesting further intensification of conditions likely. spot cpo prices have fallen by 2% in the past month to rm2,136 per tonne due to the weaker demand for cpo. the average cpo price achieved in the first 11 months of financial year ending 2014 (rm2,402.5 per tonne) was in line with our full-year projection of rm2,390 per tonne. we maintain our neutral sector rating and continue to prefer planters that offer strong output growth

timing of job wins and inspite of the steep fall in share price. \"we remain concerned about mudajayas weak job awards success rate in 2014 but this would be partly offset by the group's relatively

revenue and rm104.8 million in net profit. pibb also expects mudajaya's earnings to be soft for the next 2 to 3 quarters, with the projected commercial operation date for its first unit of the 4 x 360mw coal-fired power plant still kept at end-2014 but earnings will probably start to kick in meaningfully by 1h2015 (with all units fired up) which it believes will shore up the weak earnings

rm3.28. felda global ventures holdings bhd (fgv) posted its first quarterly core net loss of rm12 million mainly due to the rm117 million loss incurred by its downstream business, lower sugar contribution and higher fair value losses due to changes in land lease agreement liability. the downstream losses were partly due to unrealised losses of rm52million from the commodity contracts in the canadian business and losses from its refining division. its sugar subsidiary, msm, posted a 35% year-on-year (y-o-y) decline in the third quarter of financial year 2014 (3qfy14) net profit due to rising competition from cheaper imported refined sugar in the industrial segment of the domestic market. the groups first nine months of 2014 core net profit fell 40% y-o-y, as the additional contributions from its newly-acquired assets were insufficient to offset the poorer performance of certain key business divisions. fgv posted a 3% y-o-y rise in 3qfy14 fresh fruit bunch (ffb) output, which we consider to be below the countrys achievement of 3% increase during the same period. this is because fgv has added around 5% of additional mature oil palm area from the acquisition of pontian united plantations bhd in 4qfy13. the downstream unit sank into heavier losses in 3q due to the losses from its refining and canadian operations. during its teleconference, management explained that the losses from its commodity contracts were the main reason for its downstream losses. we gathered that the losses were partly unrealised and may reverse in 4qfy14. this fails to excite us, as we are concerned about the possible earnings dilution from its recent acquisition of asian plantations ltd. the loss-making downstream business, poor 3qfy14 results, weaker yield achievement by its estates, possible earnings dilution and weaker balance sheet position after the acquisition of asian plantations lead us to downgrade the stock from hold to reduce.  cimb research, nov 28  this article first

at the core of this was a government-driven, industry-wide consolidation via mergers and acquisitions (m&a) in 1999, where some 23 banks were eventually reduced to 10 by the early 2001/2. sixteen years after the crisis, malaysia is left with eight banking groups as the industry consolidates further. the number will be reduced to seven if the proposed rhb bank-cimb bank-malaysia building society bhd (mbsb) merger is successfully concluded.as at press time, the three parties have come to an agreement and submitted a proposal to bank negara malaysia for approval. \nthe proposed merger will involve a three-step process. first, cimb bank will merge with rhb bank, with the latter acquiring cimb shares in a share swap. cimb group holdings bhd will emerge as the biggest shareholder in the merged entity with a 70% stake, while rhb capital bhd will end up with 30%. the second step will be a merger of the islamic arms of cimb and rhb. then, the newly merged entity will merge with mbsb to form the largest islamic bank in malaysia.putting together the deal and coming to an agreement on the structure is only the first hurdle  the proposal will have to be approved by the regulators and eventually, the shareholders. the whole exercise is scheduled to be completed by january 2015. this mega bank merger will create the countrys largest banking group, displacing malayan banking bhd (maybank). it will be the fourth largest bank in southeast asia, with total assets of us$194 billion (rm633.3 billion). there are expectations the rhb bank-cimb bank-mbsb merger will spark another round of m&a in the local banking sector. theres talk that banks such as ambank, affin bank and alliance bank could be involved in the next round of consolidation.all this could leave malaysia with five banking groups, excluding islamic banks and foreign banks. the question is, will these bank mergers be good for all stakeholders, including the man in the street? the answer, industry experts and bankers say, depends on where one is coming from. for investment banks, it is great because they can earn huge fees for putting the mergers together. in fact, some of them already see the potential and have gone to some of the other banking groups to pitch merger proposals. for the banks involved, economies of scale are always an advantage when competition heats up and where technology and innovation increasingly decide who will win the game. banks need deep pockets to go up the it ladder and this is where size and financial might come in. bank consolidation to create financially sound institutions, as a whole, is beneficial to the industry and the public. that is why in many countries, such as sinagpore and the uk, the number of banks has been reduced to just a handful. in fact, the 1999 consolidation in malaysia created a banking sector that was more resilient and less vulnerable to financial crises. this was proved during the 2008 global financial crisis. while the big western banks took a hit, malaysian banks came out of the crisis relatively unscathed. \nthe question now is whether an even smaller number of banks is a good thing. a lesson learnt from the 2008 global financial crisis is that big is not always beautiful. and there will always be room for niche banks.the collapse of us financial juggernaut lehman brothers in 2008 and its contagion sent shock waves across global financial markets. stock markets crashed and the us financial system was almost brought to its knees. while lehman was allowed to fall, a massive bailout programme was undertaken by the other big players, such as aig and bank of america, costing us taxpayers some us$300 billion, according to news reports. too big to fail became a catchphrase associated with the 2008 crisis. what about consumers? too big to fail will have implications for consumers when taxpayer money is used to bail out troubled banking institutions. industry experts say banking mergers, or any merger for that matter, should be viewed from three perspectives: prudential safety, competition and public interest. studies in developed countries have shown that public interest is not always a priority when regulators assess whether to give the green light or not. certainly, in malaysia, banking mergers almost always involve some form of retrenchment. in recent times, to be politically acceptable, the merged banks have introduced voluntary separation schemes (vss) and mutual separation schemes (mss). such schemes are not carried out immediately after a merger but tend to take place a year later or so when the integration is well on the way and the bank has a better idea of the extent of the excess in the workforce and number of overlapping branches. cimb, for example, said in 2009 that it would close 60 branches following its merger with southern bank bhd in 2006. branch closures inevitably result in redundancies. the national union of bank employees (nube) has already articulated its concerns that the rhb bank-cimb bank-mbsb merger will result in a vss or mss as the two banks have quite a number of branches in the same location. together, the merged entity will have 550 branches, compared with maybanks 399. the thinking is that bigger banks will result in greater efficiency and lower costs, which should translate into better services and cheaper financial products for consumers. however, industry experts say there was no hard evidence of this after the 1999 consolidation exercise. indeed, if we compare the pricing of loans, whether mortgage or hire purchase, there is very little difference across the eight banking groups. additionally, if we look at the fixed deposit and savings rates, the difference is also minimal. in fact, in the uk and canada, m&a in the banking sector have become a major point of debate, focusing on whether they result in an oligopoly, or a concentration of pricing power in the hands of a handful of financial institutions. there is a large number of banks, local and foreign, in malaysia. even so, industry observers say oligopolistic traits seem to be setting in, especially in how banks set interest rates. a complex monopoly develops when a group of two or more banks controls at least 25% of the market and prevents, restricts or disturbs the competition. malaysias big three banks  maybank, cimb bank and public bank  command a more than 25% of the loans market. it is estimated that the rhb bank-cimb bank-mbsb merger would give it a 23% share of the domestic loans market  and a lot of pricing power in the space. a few years ago, the mortgage segment became very competitive and a price war took place. at the time, industry observers said some of the banks were concerned about price undercutting and efforts were made to stop the price war. hence, creating bigger banks is not necessarily beneficial to consumers, as it reduces choice and competition. the experience in other countries is that this especially impacts the small and medium enterprises, which have always faced difficulties in getting bank funding. in malaysia, because of the huge presence of foreign and islamic banks, customers have ample choice when it comes to banking services. however, if the number of local banks continues to shrink, this may no longer be the case, and the whole game could be played differently. this article was

fbm klci index traded in a narrower range of 22.05 points for the week with slightly lower volumes of 2.11 billion to 1.41 billion shares traded. the index closed at 1,822.29 yesterday, down 2.1 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like british american tobacco (m) bhd, cimb group holdings bhd, kuala lumpur kepong bhd, misc bhd, petronas dagangan bhd and rhb capital bhd caused the index to decline on persistent selling activities. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since may 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69 (high), 1,802.88 (low), 1,896.23 (high), 1,837.28 (low), 1,879.62 (high), 1,766.22 (low), 1,858.09 (high), 1,805.35 (low) and 1,827.40 (high). most of the indexs daily signals have turned negative (except stochastic) recently. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at 1,766, 1,805 and 1,817, while the resistance areas of 1,822, 1,858 and 1,896 would offer very heavy liquidation and profit-taking activities. the klcis 18 and 40 simple moving averages (sma) depict a downtrend for its daily chart. in addition, the 50 and 200 sma have also issued a dead cross and the index prices are still below these two longer-term smas and below the shorter-term 18 and 40 smas. therefore, the recent rebound from the 1,766.22 low has obviously stalled at 1,858.09. this has opened up downside possibilities for the index once again. due to the uncertain tone for the klci, we are recommending a chart sell on airasia x bhd (aax). aax recently announced its third quarter of financial year 2014 (3qfy14) results. according to our fundamental analyst, the 3qfy14 core net loss was greater than estimated by the industry. the disappointing result was attributed to low yields due to overcapacity which aax will reduce its capacity growth in fy14 to fy16 by deferring and selling aircraft. our analyst has an unchanged sell call on aax with a rm0.57 target price. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that 11 research houses cover aax. of these, there is a single buy call, four hold calls and six sell calls on the stock. this company is currently loss-making with its price-to-book value ratio at 1.68 times indicating a premium to its book value and its debt-to-equity ratio is at 161.5%. aaxs chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly down. its share price made a decline since its major weekly wave-2 high of rm1.23 in august 2013. since that rm1.23 high, aax fell to its november 2014 all-time low of rm0.61. as prices broke below their recent key critical support levels of rm1 and rm0.69, look to sell aax on any rebounds to its resistance areas as the mas depict very firm short- to medium-term downtrends for this stock. the daily and weekly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, oscillator and stochastic) have issued sellsignals and now depict very firm indications of aaxs eventual move towards much lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm0.615, rm0.69 and rm1. we expect aax to witness weak buying interest

holders to ride on smrts expected growth trajectory. in august, smrt secured a contract from the ministry of education to train and upskill 1,000 english teachers. this follows the three-year contract

bhd, a 62.7%-owned subsidiary of petroliam nasional bhd (petronas), will have much to gain if the national oil company abandons its strategy to directly own its fleet of liquefied natural gas (lng) vessels. in a report yesterday, cimb research is of the view that petronas may sell four lng new builds it ordered in 2013 as it relegates ship ownership to low priority. gan jian bo, an analyst with cimb research, said petronas may be changing its ship ownership strategy to directly order lng vessels, revealed in august 2013, because its hands are full with lng projects in malaysia and overseas which offer a lot better internal rate of return (irr). petronas is very busy with several projects. they have the refinery and petrochemical integrated development (rapid) project in malaysia, the gladstone lng project in australia and one in canada with progress energy, gan told the edge financial daily. gan estimates that lng projects would typically offer irr of 12% to 15%, compared with the high single-digit returns from the shipping business. if petronas does sell these vessels to misc, petronas will likely charter these ships from misc to meet its shipping requirements in bintulu and other ongoing projects like flng1, said cimb research. the inclusion of four new long-term lng charter contracts with petronas will help mitigate miscs lng earnings decline, since six of its lng ship charters expire in 2014 to 2017, it said. this is timely as petronas four new vessels are slated for delivery in 2016 and 2017 and will be earnings accretive from 2017. the new ships also come with the option to procure four additional lng vessels, which could be passed on to misc. with that view, cimb research made an add call on miscs stock at rm6.90 and gave it a target price of rm8.22. midf research said petronas change of strategy is logical as it does not have the expertise to manage lng vessels. petronas ordered the four lng new builds after its attempt to privatise misc failed to ensure that there will be no interruption in the lng transportation services, an analyst from midf research told the edge financial daily. petronas does not have the expertise to manage these assets and had to engage misc to manage the construction of the new ships. selling the ships to misc would make sense, he said. he added that the shipping expert would also have the financial muscle to acquire the four vessels from petronas, having strengthened its balance sheet after the sale of its 50% stake in gumusut-kasap semi floating production system (l) ltd to petronas carigali sdn bhd in 2013. to recap, petronas had in august last year announced that it had decided to buy its own lng vessels, after it failed to privatise misc. two months later, the group awarded the contract to build four lng vessels, with the option to order an additional four lng vessels, to south koreas hyundai heavy industries co. at the same time, misc was engaged to provide project management and technical

rm501.1 million from rm660.4 million, despite marginally better revenue at rm23.96 billion from rm24.89 million, as its retail segment reported lower operating margins of 3.2% versus 5.3% in the previous corresponding period. in a research note yesterday, cimb research said it expects a decent 4qfy14 as year-end travel spurs petrol and jet fuel sales, even as it noted that petdags 9mfy14 net

growth, cautioned that margins may still be depressed  particularly from the retail segment  again, due to the sliding oil prices. alliance dbs tan, however, said petdags sales volume, which has been growing at a single-digit percentage, does not help much, citing the mops losses of rm70.5 million incurred in 3q alone, which is already one-third of petdags operating profit of rm230.7 million. as

is acquiring are expected to yield at least 7%. besides, the refurbishment of its existing assets would also bring higher rents. axis reit has proposed to acquire an industrial facility in nusajaya from yongnam engineering sdn bhd for rm153.5 million cash, and three assets in shah alam from its promoters for rm280.5 million cash. the acquisitions will increase axis reits net leasable area (nla) to 6.23 million sq ft by the first quarter of next year, from 5.33 million sq ft as at june 30, 2014. you will see property income jump next year as we collect more rental revenue from the new assets. the rental revenue from the nusajaya facility is about rm12 million per annum for the next three years, says datuk stewart labrooy, ceo of axis reit managers bhd (armb), the management company of axis reit. rhb trustees bhd, the trustee for axis reit, on oct 3 entered into a sales and purchase agreement (spa) with yongnam for the purchase of the industrial facility built on a 10.9ha site within the southern industrial and logistics clusters (silc). as part of the deal, yongnam will lease back the property from axis reit for 15 years, with rental reversions every three years. both yongnam and axis reit will endeavour to complete the deal by march 31, 2015. according to labrooy, only 16.2% of the trusts nla is up for rental reversion next year, compared with 34.3% this year. the growth will come mainly from the new assets to be acquired in shah alam, nusajaya and seberang perai.  axisreits net property income for the first half of financial year ending dec 31, 2014 was flat at rm59.03 million, compared with rm59.76 million previously. the absence of earnings growth is because the trust had lost rental income fromaxisbusiness campus in petaling jaya, which underwent a major asset enhancement initiative (aei), since 2013. it also had to reduce rent by 17.54% at axissteel centre in port klang to retain its tenant konsortium logistik bhd. according toaxisreits website, revenue from axissteel centre in 2013 was rm7.07 million. the tenant was having difficulties at that point in time. it was actually growing quite rapidly but it needed some incentive to stay on. but out of this discount, we are creating the possibility of doing more business with the company at other sites. it is expanding, so it is looking for more space. our promoters are looking to build new facilities for it to lease. sometimes, you have to give back a little to get more from it. it is part of our leasing strategy, labrooy tells the edge in an exclusive interview. on the yongnam deal, the singapore-based construction and engineering company is going to pay rm969,313 per month in rent for the first three years. this givesaxisreita decent annual rental yield of 7.6%. besides the silc property acquisition,axisreithas also entered into an spa with its promoters tew peng hwee and datuk abas carl gunnar abdullah for the acquisition ofaxisshah alam dc2,axis shah alam dc3 andaxismro hub. dc3 buildings a and b are currently occupied by konsortium logistik, with the tenancies expiring in 2016 with the option to renew them for another five years. dc3 building c is occupied by lf logistics services (m) sdn bhd, with the tenancy expiring in 2020 with the option to renew it for another six years. dc2 will be leased back to able heights (m) sdn bhd, a company 75%-owned by tew, for three years. the shah alam properties to be acquired will giveaxisreitan annual net yield before islamic finance cost of 7%. axisreit, through rhb trustees, has also signed a letter of offer for the purchase of an industrial facility in seberang perai for rm38 million. the trust says due diligence is being carried out. last year, we didnt make any acquisitions because the expectations of asset owners were unreasonable. we dont buy for the sake of buying, we only do so when we have good opportunities to enhance our portfolio. we think the market is coming back, so it will give us more acquisition possibilities, says labrooy. apart from acquisitions,axisreitis renovating and refurbishing its properties to enhance their value. the aei onaxisbusiness campus is expected to giveaxisreitrm7.6 million in property income or a projected gross yield of 13%. axisreitis also undertaking a rm10 million aei onaxisbusiness park block c in section 13, petaling jaya. once the refurbishment is completed  targeted for january 2015  the asset will give the trust rm7.2 million in property income or a projected gross yield of 12.76%, according toaxis reit. the annex, a double-storey showroom linked to a single-storey warehouse located in the industrial and commercial area of section 19, petaling jaya, is also up for a rm30 million aei. the redeveloped the annex will give an estimated gross property income of rm4.5 million or a projected gross yield of 10.6%. the aei is slated to begin in 2016, says labrooy. as the trust expands its assets through debts, its gearing ratio is creeping up. according to cimb researchs analyst faisal syed ahmad, the acquisition of the yongnam asset will push up axisreits gearing to 38.6%. as we are a shariah-compliantreit, we try to keep our gearing level at around a third. that is really our sweet spot, although we do go beyond that when we make acquisitions. but we will bring it back down through placements. we never want to get anywhere close to the 50% level allowed for areit, because once you get there, youll get comfortable. youll never want to bring it down. and even if you bring it down from the 50% level, your yield will drop, explains labrooy. to reduce its borrowings, axisreitwill undertake a placement of 83.58 million units by april next year to refinance the acquisition of the shah alam assets. the exercise will increaseaxis reits issued fund size to 547.28 million units and reduce its gearing to around 34%. with the expanded fund size,axisreit will be worth about rm2 billion, based on last thursdays closing price of rm3.65 per unit. it will be the largest industrialreit in malaysia and the sixth largest overall after the big-cap retail reits. axisreits unit price has risen 30.56% since

issuer since national carrier malaysian airline system bhd.s debut in 2012 and so far $998 million has been raised in the nation, data compiled by bloomberg show. the securities appeal to investors who are willing to take on a greater degree of risk in exchange for a higher yield, according to ram rating services bhd., the bigger of malaysias two credit assessors. perpetual islamic bonds are treated as equity rather than debt on a companys balance sheet, enabling firms to raise funds without affecting their creditworthiness. airasias planned perpetual sukuk will add to the growing list of such offerings that bring a new dimension to issuers and investors in the islamic market, suzaizi mohd morshid, kuala lumpur-based head of treasury at rhb islamic bank bhd., a unit of rhb capital

corporate issuance climbed 54 percent to 51.3 billion ringgit, surpassing 2013s 49 billion ringgit. now that the sukuk market is well-established, it makes sense for corporates to consider selling perpetuals because the islamic market has a bigger pool of investors, badlisyah abdul ghani, chief executive officer of cimb islamic bank bhd., the top sukuk arranger, said in a oct. 30 phone

spotlight was suddenly thrown onto secondary shareholders. aabar, which owns 21 percent of rhb, wants its stake in the bank to be valued at 11-12 ringgit per share, sources familiar with the deal said. that would be as much as 11 percent more than what aabar paid three years ago for its rhb holding and above the value placed on rhb of 10.03 ringgit per share in the proposed merger. \"aabar is not happy to take another cut on its investment. they were not happy with the merger talks... looking at the market price for rhb, they know the likelihood of making money on this is negligible,\" said a gulf source close to the fund. but it is not in aabar's interests to derail the deal as a failed merger could drive down shares in the stock market, hurting aabar's investment in rhb, analysts say. under the deal, rhb will issue shares to the much larger cimb, but cimb shareholders will own 70 percent of the merged entity. the islamic banking arms of cimb and rhb would then acquire mbsb to form what would be one of the world's biggest islamic banks. agreement to aabar's elevated valuation could increase the cost of the share swap for cimb shareholders by at least 20 percent, according to reuters calculations. aabar did not respond to several requests for comments. rhb declined to comment, while cimb and mbsb did not immediately respond to reuters queries. \"we believe it is more likely that cimb walks away from the proposed m&a than to be constrained by the remaining shareholders of rhbc/mbsb seeking better terms for a 'favourable vote',\" chris oh, a kuala lumpur-based ubs analyst, wrote in a note. but a failed merger will be a big setback for cimb chairman nazir razak, the brother of malaysian prime minister najib razak, some analysts say, diminishing the bank's stature in the long run. losing the deal could create an opportunity for malayan banking bhd (maybank), the country's biggest banking group, to take another stab at rhb after scrapping takeover talks in 2011. \"the ultimate completion of this deal hinges on the bank's (cimb's) determination on seeing this deal through,\" said kevin kwek, a singapore-based analyst at sanford c. bernstein. \"letting this go can mean maybank steps into the picture, and the limited options available to get larger.\" about making money aabar bought the rhb stake from abu dhabi commercial bank in june 2011 at a rich price of 10.8 ringgit per share, which valued rhb at around $7.2 billion, or 2.25 times its book value. aabar, a top shareholder at a number of international firms, is now keen to make money on the deal after the value of its global assets slumped. aabar's parent company, international petroleum investment co (ipic), took a $3.4 billion writedown on aabar's stakes in unicredit and automaker daimler in 2011. aabar then wrote off $392 million of its $1 billion investment in the commodities trader glencore, less than two years after taking part in its listing. sources say, if all fails, malaysia may turn to its close relationship with the abu dhabi leadership to broker a mutually acceptable deal. osk holdings bhd, the next largest shareholder in rhb after aabar with a 9.9 percent stake, could also be key to the success of aabar's demand. both investors would see their combined voting power in the lender increase to 53 percent from 31 percent now that the epf is barred from voting. osk could follow in aabar's footsteps as it would also benefit from aabar's demand for a higher premium, said an investment banker who used to work with osk, a small financial group built by malaysian veteran broker ong leong huat. but many bankers and analysts see it differently, saying osk is unlikely to do \"anything funny\" and jeopardise the proposed merger. osk officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment."}, "661": {"date_posted": "24/10/2014", "title": "ifca msc regains upward momentum", "article": " kuala lumpur (oct 24): ifca msc bhd will stand to gain

the matter is not likely to make an exception to its listing rules that prevent the epf from being allowed to vote, as it is a significant shareholder in all three entities. the key vote is at rhb capital in which epf has a 41.5% stake and the group opposed to the merger u2013 abu dhabis aaabar investments pjs - has 21.2% stake. if epf cant vote at rhb capital, it will require that the remaining shareholders who collectively hold 37.3 % will vote in favour for the deal to go through. all that is needed is for 50% plus one share of the eligible votes to be in favour. sources say the minority shareholders of rhb capital have to decide what to do, because if the merger does not proceed, the stock could come under selling pressure. both rhb and mbsb rose following the mega merger announcement on july 10.  rhbs stock ended the day higher at rm9.18 on july 11 from its close of rm8.72 on july 9 while mbsbs stock closed at rm2.46 compared to rm2.34 during in the same period. rhbs stock price continued on its uptrend and closed at a historic high of rm9.15 on aug 19. it has since come down, partly due to the fall of the stock market this month, to close at rm8.52 before lunch today. the merger proposal values rhb capital at rm10.03 a share, although there is no cash involved as the transaction is a share swap between rhb capital and cimb group. if bursa does not allow epf to vote, the chances of it (merger) failing is higher and this may result in cimbs stock going up as the market has perceived this deal to be negative for them. alternatively, rhb and mbsb may see

the banking sector, following details that emerged yesterday of the merger between cimb group holdings bhd, rhb capital bhd (rhbcap) and malaysia building society bhd (mbsb). in a note this morning, affin hwang capital research analyst tan ei leen said while the banking sector itself lacked re-rating catalysts in the second half of the year due to weaker trading/investment gains potential, moderating loans growth and a tighter liquidity situation, the merger would not add much excitement. \"[this is] owing to the underlying risks as there are still stumbling blocks emanating from the employees provident fund's (epf) ability to vote in the merger and the reaction of other shareholders. \"we do not discount on potential equity capital-raising amounting to rm7.5 billion (related to the acquisition of mbsb) to beef up capital buffers and eventually other debt capital securities along the way, of which may cause funding cost to rise as well,\" she said. for sector exposure, affin hwang capital research said it favours alliance financial group bhd and hong leong bank bhd. meanwhile, uob kay hian research is maintaining a 'market weight' call on the sector, saying malayan banking bhd (maybank) could be an indirect beneficiary of the proposed tripartite merger. \"given maybanks well-balanced portfolio between consumer, commercial lending and investment banking segments coupled with its government links, we believe maybank could be an indirect beneficiary of any potential customer attrition emanating from the merger,\" said its analyst keith wee teck keong in a note. wee is also of the view that the proposed acquisition is unexciting as mbsb's prospects are diminishing. \"even if the merged entity is allowed to maintain mbsbs civil servants personal loan deduction codes, we note the recent macro-prudential measure by bank negara malaysia to cap the maximum tenure of personal loans from 25 years to 10 years has severely stunted growth within mbsbs personal loan segment, which has been the key driving force of the group,\" he said. \"as the slowdown in personal loans is structural in nature, we expect growth moderation to continue to intensify, which essentially diminishes the appeal in mbsbs prospects,\" he added. wee also noted that the potential value of cimb is now trending towards the downside. he said since cimb shareholders would be receiving a large part of the consideration in rhbcap shares, and given that the return on equity (roe) dilution of the enlarged merger entity was significant u2013 the immediate-term value destruction that cimb shareholders would face is relatively pronounced. uob kay hian research has downgraded its call on rhbcap to 'sell', with a target price of rm8. at 12.30pm, cimb shares lost 28

was up 4.6% year to date, remains behind our 2014 target of 9% due to higher repayments. however, our channel checks indicate that certain sectors may see a pickup in the second half of 2014 (2h14), with august 2014 loan applications, approvals and disbursements rebounding month-on-month (m-o-m) driven mainly by the business segment. our top stock picks include hong leong bank bhd, alliance financial group bhd (afg) and malayan banking bhd (maybank). as the pace of the first eight months of 2014 (8m14) loan repayments was up 16.7% year-on-year (y-o-y) which was ahead of total loan disbursements (+12.4% yoy), this has continued to weigh on system loan expansion. higher repayments were largely related to household, manufacturing, retail trade and finance or insurance sectors. in our view, this trend was evident in banks with bigger exposure to the corporate segment such as ammb holdings bhd, maybank and cimb group, whose second quarter of 2014 (2q14) loan growth was sluggish at -1.9%, and up 2.3% and 0.2% quarter-on-quarter respectively. a 1% decline in loan growth will negatively impact sector earnings by about 1.1%, implying a potential 2.3% downside risk to our sector net profit forecast. as at august 2014, household loans continued to maintain a steady growth rate of 11% y-o-y compared with 11.1% y-o-y in july 2014 despite the macroprudential measures. this segment continues to outpace business loans, which grew by a moderate 6.7% y-o-y versus 6.8% y-o-y in july 2014. in august 2014, we saw an increase of 4.9% m-o-m increase in loan applications, underpinned primarily by a 9.8% m-o-m expansion in new business loan applications versus households, up 0.4% m-o-m. loan approvals increased m-o-m as well at 3.9% against 0.6% m-o-m in july 2014, with a more marked increase in business loans. driven by a stronger disbursement trend m-o-m, rising by 6.5%, the system outstanding loan in august 2014 grew by 0.7% m-o-m versus a flattish m-o-m growth in july 2014. on a y-o-y basis, system loan outstanding grew by 8.6%. based on channel checks, some key sectors are expected to see a potential increase in the drawdown of corporate loans in 2h14 such as oil & gas, agriculture and infrastructure. though the transportation (8.2% of total impaired loans) and agriculture (1.5% of total) sectors saw increases in gross impaired loans by 12.3% y-o-y and 21% y-o-y respectively, we believe that the impact of the increase is still minimal to the overall impaired loans in the banking system down 5.2% y-o-y. the system gross impaired loan ratio, meanwhile, eased to 1.75% in august 2014 from 1.76% in july 2014. we maintain neutral on the malaysian banking sector given a lack of rerating catalyst in 2h14 on the back of weaker trading, investment gains potential, moderating loans growth, and a tighter liquidity situation. nonetheless, the drive for further consolidation within the sector could bring excitement and drive valuations higher for the sector. for sector exposure, we favour afg and hong leong, given their business models, compelling valuations and niche positioning. maybank remains a solid banking group, well-capitalised and with a strong investment bank platform via maybank-kimeng and offer an attractive financial year 2015 dividend yield of 5.6%.  affin hwang capital, oct 1\n this article first appeared in the edge financial

by year-end. management believes that there are no reasons to delay the restructuring of selangors water industry as the offer price is not likely to be revised. we also believe that the overall rm1.6 billion price tag offers sufficient compensation for the negative bv of 70%-owned syabas. we believe that the rm1.6 billion incoming cash (likely in the first quarter of 2015) would be timely and sufficient to fund the groups oil and gas capital expenditure/acquisitions over the next 12 to 18 months. we also do not rule out the possibility of puncak niaga paying out special dividends. management is exploring the possibility of a bumper dividend payout in 2014/15. we estimate that if puncak niaga sets aside a mere 8% to 10% of the rm1.6 billion cash proceeds for special dividends, it will translate into a special dividend of 25 sen to 30 sen per share and potential dividend yield of 7% to 8%. puncak niagas last bumper dividend payout was a capital repayment of around 60 sen per share in 2006. puncak niagas share price has risen by 20% since our upgrade on june 11, 2014. at full value (that is, zero discount to sum-of-parts [sop]), puncak niaga is worth rm5.35 per share (fully diluted for warrants and convertible bonds). our sop includes the oil and gas segment, valued at an arguably conservative target calendar year 2015 price-earnings ratio of 16 times. hypothetically, if we were to cut our sop discount from 20% to 10% in view of the improved sentiment on the stock, our target price will rise to rm4.82, which presents an attractive 28% upside from the current level. maintain add with unchanged target price of rm4.28. we understand that the negotiations between puncak niaga and the the federal and selangor governments will run its own course, regardless of the progress of the takeover talks for gamuda bhds 45%-owned syarikat pengeluar air selangor holdings bhd (the selangor governments last water asset target). puncak niagas water negotiations should reach critical milestones in the second half of this year. we think that there are minimal execution and delay risks for puncak niagas exit from the water concession business for good. instead, we anticipate that investors will develop greater appreciation for the pog growth story post-water restructuring.  cimb research, june 23 this article first appeared in the edge

since then, only five other etfs have been introduced  a lethargic pace, compared with the etf market in neighbouring countries.  an etf is an investment fund that is traded on the stock exchange. singapores first locally created etf, the spdr straits times index etf, listed in 2002. twelve years later, 96 etfs have listed on the singapore exchange, of which 11 originated from the island-state. the rest are cross-listed etfs (an etf that initially listed in a foreign market, such as the us, then also listed in singapore). thailands first etf was introduced in september 2007 and there are currently 17 etfs trading on its stock market. thai asset managers issue all of the countrys etfs.  the low-cost and instant diversification offered by an etf has obvious advantages. so, why arent there more etfs on bursa malaysia?  industry observers cite a chicken-and-egg problem: with only nascent demand, issuers are not motivated to issue new etfs. without new etfs and the accompanying educational and awareness activities by an issuer, demand from retail investors stays weak.  this situation can change if an etf issuer decides to buck the trend and issues new etfs based on the long-term premise that savvy investors will increasingly appreciate and ask for low-cost passive investments. i-vcap management sdn bhd is attempting to be the game changer.  in april, the asset manager launched myetf msci malaysia islamic dividend etf, the first etf to list after a four-year hiatus. back in 2010, cimb-principal asset management bhd launched two offshore etfs.  i-vcap ceo and director mahdzir othman says the company is working on making etfs interesting to the retail market and is planning to launch another syariah-compliant etf later this year. etfs have proven themselves as a workable product in developed markets outside malaysia. the low-cost structure really benefits investors. an etf market needs variety so that investors can implement their own asset allocation strategy with etfs in their portfolio, says mahdzir.  he points out that although singapore has a large number of listed etfs, trading volumes have been low and about half are usually inactive.  perhaps the biggest misconception among investors is that a low trading volume means that the etf is illiquid and thus a risky investment.  this shows a need for more education. an etf has appointed market-makers. these are the guys who will make or redeem units in an etf based on demand. so, if you want to evaluate the liquidity of an etf, you have to look at the liquidity of its underlying assets. in other words, what is the etf holding and are those assets frequently traded?  education on the benefits of and how an etf works is a long-term process that requires commitment from all the stakeholders in the market.  investors often treat etfs as they do stocks and expect quick returns. this does not work. it is more accurate to benchmark etfs against unit trust funds that invest in the same category of underlying assets. fund tables such as lipper include etfs in their ranking of collective investment schemes.  if you look at lippers fund tables, you will see that etfs are not the worst performers. this says that passive investments are outperforming some actively managed funds. those who are invested in such funds are paying a higher fee for a fund manager as well as a high upfront fee, only to have their fund underperform a low-cost etf which just follows an index. in this case, which is the better investment?  of course, im not saying that unit trust funds are bad investments. these are the choices available and an investor needs to know the pros and cons of each type in order to make an informed decision about what is best for them, says mahdzir (see how local etfs stack up against unit trust funds below). besides education, there is another growth driver that can spur an etf market. this is the financial advisory industry. the assumption is this: when the financial product distribution model moves from commission-based to fee-based, advisors will start recommending cheaper etfs to their clients. according to news reports, this was the us experience after 2008. there, fee-based assets drove the uptake of etfs among retail investors who currently contribute to about half the trades in the etf market in the us. the rest of the trades are by institutional investors. singapores etf market is also expected to see more liquidity if a fee-based financial product distribution model gains critical mass. in malaysia, the financial product distribution model is still largely commission-based. this means that agents are not incentivised to educate their clients on passive investments such as etfs and their benefits.  i-vcap does not manage unit trust funds although it can manage private mandates. neither does it have a sister company that distributes unit trust funds. this does away with any possible conflict of interest. as collective investment schemes, an etf and a unit trust fund have similarities (as well as differences). the former can be seen as a threat to the livelihood of unit trust agents who charge a sales fee of up to 6.5% for equity unit trust funds. in contrast, an investor will pay the much lower brokerage fee, stamp duty and clearing fee to trade an etf. this is similar to the fees incurred when buying or selling a share.  an etf asset manager survives solely on the management fee of an etf that averages around 0.4% per annum for etfs with local underlying assets and 0.6% per annum for etfs with foreign underlying assets. in contrast, unit trust management companies can charge up to 1.8% per annum to manage equity funds. this means that an etf needs to be sizeable before its manager can reap cost efficiencies.  the uncertainty of when etfs will gain enough traction to be financially viable is probably why the biggest etf issuers in the world, such as blackrock and ishares, have not entered the local market although they are already present in singapore. mahdzir adds that the local market may be more regulated than other countries, a move that deters foreign issuers but protects the local investors. etfs are not the most exciting investment. they are passive investments and some can be riskier than others, such as those with small to mid-cap stock exposure, or those with foreign asset exposure. it is typically a long-term investment, much like a unit trust fund, but it does not levy a high upfront fee. so there is much to like and i hope more investors will warm up to the idea of using etfs in their portfolio, says mahdzir. how local etfs stack up against unit trust funds fund ranking tables display the return made by a collective investment scheme on a net asset value (nav)-to-nav basis. the cost to invest paid by an investor is not included in this figure. this means that an investors personal returns are lower than displayed in the table. so if an investor had paid an upfront fee of 6% to invest in a unit trust fund that made a return of 6% over a year, he actually made a loss after paying the funds annual management fee of 1.5% per annum.  the unit trust fund industry strives to make returns that surpass the fees imposed on investors. only then does it make financial sense to invest in a fund. on this basis, unit trust funds should outperform low-cost passively managed investments such as exchange-traded funds (etfs).  but etfs in the country have actually outperformed a large number of their peers, which are actively managed unit trust funds. their historical performance can be found in the lippers unit trust performance table, that shows the return or loss made by collective investment schemes (unit trust funds, etfs, real estate investment trusts). the newest etf in the country, i-vcap management sdn bhds shariah-compliant myetf msci malaysia islamic dividend etf, is not included as it has yet to acquire a one-year performance. two etfs, which fall under the popular syariah-compliant and conventional equity malaysia fund categories, have performed very well against their actively managed peers. i-vcaps first etf had a return of 119.04% in the five years ending march 31. the average return made by its syariah-compliant category is 105.38%, which means this passive investment outperformed the average return made by its actively managed peers.it is ranked 15 out of 49 collective investment schemes.  the fmb klci etf made a return of 133.25% during this five-year period. it also outperformed the average return of 131.56% made by its category. it is ranked 28 out of 66 collective investment schemes. in the shorter duration of one year and three years, the performance of both etfs is closer to the average returns made by their respective categories. in the equity china category, cimb ftse china 25 etf made a loss of 9.02% in the three-year period ending march 31, 2014 and outperformed two peer unit trust funds. this category of four collective investment schemes (three funds and cimb ftse china 25 etf) made an average loss of 17.60% for this period.  cimb ftse asean 40 malaysia etf is the second lowest performer in the equity asean category for the three-year duration ending march 31, with a five-year return of 14.33%. its category made an average return of 17.97% for this period. this performance is more consistent with the expected return of passive investments against actively managed funds.  the only bond etf in the market also performed as expected from a passive investment. it made a five-year return ending march 31 of 17.15%, against its category average return of 27.45%. this could be attributed to its portfolio of mostly malaysian government securities. bond funds usually invest in higher-yielding corporate papers. but it is not the worst performer in its category, with a rank of 25 out of 28 collective investment schemes.  if the cost to investing is taken into account, local etfs have outperformed even more of their peers  the actively managed funds. this means investors need to be very selective with the funds that they invest in or seriously consider opting for a low-cost passive etf. this article was first published in the june 2014 issue of personal money  a personal finance magazine published by the edge communications."}, "694":

percentage of cimbs malaysian staff who took part in the banking groups in-house survey in may were cautious about the local stock market performance going forward.  meanwhile, on the property market outlook, most of the cimb staff polled were planning to buy properties in the next three years while still expecting prices to rise strongly, despite the slew of cooling measures introduced by the government. in a strategy report published yesterday, titled malaysian lifestyle and habits, cimb said it received over 3,000 replies or a 40% response rate from the 8,000 staff to whom it had emailed the questionnaires.  women made up 61% of the respondents and men, 39%. by race, malays made up 48% of the respondents, chinese 39% and indians nearly 9%. some 36.43% of the respondents have monthly household incomes of rm5,001 to rm10,000, while those earning above that bracket made up 30% and those below rm5,000 per month made up 33.57% of the respondents. on stock market investments, the report said a surprisingly high number of respondents (30%) were looking to take profit on their existing positions and only 12% wanted to put more into the market.  this could reflect the perceptions by many that the klci is trading near its all-time highs and therefore the upside could be limited, it added.  but should we include the 20% that said they will hold on to their positions with those that want to put more money in, an all-in 33% expect the market to rise further. this means the bears and the bulls are nearly equally balanced, with the bulls having a slight edge, the report noted.  according to cimb, over 60% of the respondents did invest in the market, a percentage that is not small by any measure. on property purchases, cimb said 11% of the respondents planned to make a property purchase within the next 12 months while 58% planned to buy something within the next three years. fifteen percent had no intention to buy anything anytime. fifty-four percent cited affordability and financing as the key deterrent in making a purchase, with another 28% citing the property price outlook as the deterrent. in terms of expectations on the property price outlook, a huge 46% expected prices to rise strongly, 29% expected prices to rise slightly while only 13% thought prices would fall. interestingly, the lower the household income, the higher the expectation that prices would rise a lot. in general, 75% of the respondents expected property prices to continue rising while 12% expected prices to stay flat, the report said. interestingly, apart from stock market investments and property purchases, cimb had also surveyed its staff on potential purchase of motor vehicles. with lukewarm response to national car brands, the report said the outcome of the survey supports the banks view that the outlook for the national carmakers is not so bright.  although 47% of the respondents currently owned at least one national car (proton/perodua/naza) in their households, only 10% of the respondents had the intention of buying a national car in their next car purchase.  this is not surprising, as seen by the trend over the past few years and the industry

deal flows in the capital markets remain sluggish and delayed despite a still robust pipeline. tan warned: this will continue to weigh down on cimbs treasury and markets as well as its investment banking divisions. however, kenanga research maintains its market perform call and tp of rm8.00 as it believes cimb would be able to play catch-up in earnings in the subsequent quarters. we believe there is still a good chance for the bank to regain its earnings, said the kenanga research team. the macro situation in indonesia has been improving coupled with strong performance in thailand and

mas [unprofitable] routes [to stem its losses] effective its financial year ending dec 31, 2015 could cause petdags jet fuel trade to descend, said its analyst norziana mohd inon. as the main supplier of jet fuel to mas, norziana is of the view that petdag could be affected by the national carriers route rationalisation. the reason is that petdag is the biggest supplier of jet fuel at the kl international airport in sepang, with mas being its major customer. it also serves mas at heathrow, hong kong, denpasar, batam and pekan baru airports. petdag now controls around 70% of malaysias jet

commercial products include fuel oil and bitumen. [thus], we are lowering our fy15/fy16 jet fuel sales volume assumptions [for petdag] by 10% to reflect the potential lower demand from mas, she added. however, a lower requirement for jet fuel from mas could be mitigated by higher take-up by foreign airlines or new supply contracts, said norziana. in 1qfy14, petdag landed new contracts from air france, malindo and turkish airlines. other existing customers include emirates, qatar and federal express, she said. norziana is advising investors to hold on to their shares in petdag, even though she has lowered her target price from rm30.36

\"jokowi\" widodo boosted his chances in the july presidential election by securing the support of the country's second-largest political party. the jakarta stock exchange rose as much as 1.0 percent to 4,971.92 points, the highest since early june last year. msci's broadest index of asia-pacific shares outside japan was 0.65 percent higher. at 0500 gmt, the index was 0.9 percent higher for the day. the rupiah strengthened as much as 0.7 percent to 11,455 per dollar, its strongest since april 22, on demand from local and foreign banks. at 0500 gmt, the rupiah was up 0.6 percent. the indonesian currency also advanced in non-deliverable forwards markets. jokowi's indonesian democratic party-struggle, known as pdi-p, came first in april parliamentary elections but failed to win enough seats to nominate a president by itself, forcing it to join with other parties. golkar, once the political vehicle of long-time president suharto, won 15 percent of the parliamentary vote, compared with 19 percent for pdi-p. golkar's chairman is business tycoon aburizal bakrie. it won't be clear until next week how many candidates there will be in the july 9 presidential vote. if there are more than two and no candidate receives 50 percent support, there will be a second round of voting in september. \"bakrie's support for jokowi will help to reduce the duration of political uncertainty as there is a higher probability that there will only be one round of presidential election,\" said erwan teguh, an analyst at cimb securities in jakarta. \"the remaining parties that have not formed any coalition will be too small to come up with their own coalition,\" he added. teguh said potential beneficiaries of a jokowi victory include infrastructure and construction sectors as jokowi has signalled that he would focus on these areas. stocks in the sectors include construction firms pt wijaya karya and pt adhi karya as well as cement-makers pt holcim indonesia and pt semen indonesia. some analysts cautioned that even if jokowi wins, he will have to secure the legislature's support to deal with problems such as a persistent current-account deficit, slowing economic growth and an over-dependence on commodities. last week, indonesia's central bank slashed its economic growth outlook this year to the weakest level since the 2009 global financial crisis due to a drop in commodity exports. bank indonesia projected growth of 5.1-5.5 percent, down from its previous estimate of 5.5-5.9 percent. \"we think jokowi's track record looks encouraging, by and large - but a quick panacea for indonesia's macro rebalancing process is unlikely,\" morgan stanley said in an april report. the bank said expectations of reforms \"must be realistically weighed\" and take

of investments by state funds of norway, abu dhabi and china, which each manage more assets than gic and temasek combined, according to the sovereign wealth centers website. norways state fund, the worlds biggest, deployed $5.3 billion last year and china investment corp. $1.9 billion, according to the research. direct investments temasek is set up as a holding company, and mergers and acquisitions is where its expertise lies, said enrico soddu, an analyst at the sovereign wealth center. gic has been increasing its direct investments only recently in line with the insourcing trend amongst sovereign funds to save on fees to asset management companies but also because their capabilities have grown, he said. soddu added that the increase in transactions this year is not surprising because they will mainly stem from the two large deals by temasek and also because 2013 was a relatively quiet year. the total value of the 184 direct investments by sovereign wealth funds in 2013 reached $43.5 billion, 23 percent less from the previous year in value, mainly in line with a drop in cross- border mergers and acquisitions, according to the data. in 2012, the qatar investment authority was the biggest sovereign investor worldwide, with a share of 32 percent of global investments, equaling $16.4 billion, according to the data by the sovereign wealth center. repsol, watson gic made 40 direct investments last year and temasek 38, the data showed. among gics major transactions in 2013 were the purchase of a 50 percent stake in londons broadgate office complex and the acquisition of a 28.5 percent stake in goldman sachs group inc.s european insurance business. temasek bought a 5.04 percent stake in spanish oil company repsol sa for 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) last year. the firms liquefied natural gas unit pavilion energy pte in november said it would pay $1.3 billion for a 20 percent stake in three gas blocks offshore tanzania in east africa. this years purchase of the stake in a.s. watson & co., the retail arm of billionaire li ka-shings hutchison whampoa ltd., was temaseks biggest so far, according to data compiled by bloomberg, and gives the singapore state-owned investment company a stake in a business with more than 10,000 stores worldwide. breedens investments pte, the wholly-owned unit of temasek offering for the shares in olam, on april 29 said 10.3 percent of the shareholders already accepted the offer. if breedens bought all the shares not already owned at the time of the offer by a temasek unit, it could pay as much as s$4 billion. key themes temasek and its unit seatown holdings international, together with investment firm rrj capital ltd., agreed to invest in nn group, the insurance business of dutch lender ing groep nv, according to a april 30 statement by ing. temasek and seatown are contributing a combined 525 million euro, according to the statement. we invest over the long term in sectors which are good proxies to our key investment themes, said stephen forshaw, a spokesman at temasek. the mix of our portfolio may change from time to time, not to fit any target that we have, but to cater to new opportunities that emerge. temaseks holdings jumped to a record s$215 billion in the year ended march 2013, as surging global stock markets bolstered assets. patient capital the firm is the ninth-biggest state investor with an estimated $173 billion of assets, according to the sovereign wealth center website. its total investments were s$20 billion in the 12 months ended march 31, 2013, according to the singapore investment firms latest annual report, published in july. thats more than double the amount invested four years earlier. gic ranks fifth with an estimated $315 billion of assets, according to the sovereign wealth center. we look at the long-term performance of the total portfolio rather than the performance of individual asset classes or investments, gics group chief investment officer lim chow kiat said in an e-mail. our patient capital allows us to benefit from holding investments that take longer to realize their potential. political stability gics 20-year annualized real rate of return, or gains on top of global inflation that it uses as its main metric, was 4 percent in the 12 months through march 2013, up from 3.9 percent the previous year, the state fund said in its latest annual report in august. temaseks total shareholder return, which includes dividends, widened to 8.9 percent in the year ended march 2013, from 1.5 percent in the previous year. it averaged 16 percent since its inception in 1974. singapores political stability and the size of the economy are helping gic and temasek to have better access to overseas markets, said friedrich wu, an adjunct associate professor at nanyang technological university in singapore. trade-dependent singapore is seen benefiting from an improving outlook for global expansion. the asian development bank forecasts southeast asian growth to accelerate to 5.4 percent in 2015 from 5 percent this year, according to an april 1 report. the u.s., euro area and japan will collectively grow 2.2 percent next year from 1.9 percent in 2014, the adb said. u.s. growth consumer confidence was near the second-highest level in more than six years, the bloomberg consumer comfort index showed last week. the biggest gain in u.s. exports in nine months helped narrow the trade deficit in march, pointing to a revival of global demand that will help the economy strengthen. the island nation is ranked among the top five countries on transparency internationals 2013 corruption perceptions index. the u.s. placed 19th for corruption perceptions, while china was number 80. emerging markets including brazil, indonesia, south africa and turkey have undervalued assets, said wu, adding that many of them are long-term and potentially profitable. being a small and harmless country, singapores sovereign wealth funds are perceived to be politically neutral by host governments, and hence have the advantage of not being under intense political scrutiny, wu said in an e-mail."}, "716":

short-term 30-day moving average and above the ichimoku cloud. the short-term or immediate support level remained at 1,845 points and the immediate resistance level is at 1,870 points. the bullish trend should be able to continue if the index is able to break above the immediate resistance level. the momentum of the bullish trend is steady as momentum indicators like the rsi, macd and momentum oscillator are above their mid-levels. therefore, there is a high chance for the klci to test the resistance level at 1,870 points, thus continuing its uptrend. furthermore, the bollinger bands are steadily expanding upwards and the index is trading above the middle band. if the index is able to break above the immediate resistance level of 1,870 points, it confirms the triangle pattern which has a short-term target at 1,900 points. i am expecting the market to be bullish this week as the technical indicators on the klci are being supported well. the index is expected to test this immediate resistance level this week and climb higher in the short term towards 1,900 points, unless there are any reversal indications. if the klci fails to break above 1,870 points, then expect it

on the island of borneo, for more than three decades, retired in february with a billion-dollar family fortune. some of the details of taibs wealth surfaced during the divorce settlement battle between his elder son, mahmud abu bekir taib, and mahmuds ex-wife, who is seeking more than $120 million in potentially one of the biggest separation payouts in malaysia. the family has the largest stake in the states biggest infrastructure company and other assets, according to corporate filings. silver-haired with a goatee, the countrys longest-serving politician oversaw state coffers for finance, planning and resources management in malaysias biggest state, source of about half the nations crude oil output. he was given a relatively free hand to govern sarawak because of his pivotal role in keeping prime minister najib razaks national front coalition in power, said andrew aeria, an associate professor in the department of politics and international relations at universiti malaysia sarawak. the former chief minister was very powerful and influential, not only in sarawak but in national politics on account of his experience, knowledge and longevity in office, said aeria, who wrote the 2004 report, political business in sarawak: productive or lumpen capitalist? billionaire family taib and his political allies won 25 seats in the general election in may last year, without which the coalition would have lost its majority in malaysias national parliament. he stepped down as chief minister on feb. 28 and became sarawaks governor, a largely ceremonial role, the following day. the 77-year-old, who has never appeared on an international wealth ranking, presides over a family whose fortune exceeds $1 billion, according to the bloomberg billionaires index. he declined to comment on his net worth calculation and a request for an interview through jameson ahip nawie, his press secretary. the e-mailed request for the interview listed the familys assets that the calculation was based on. it also asked for his comments about the malaysian anti-corruption commissions investigation into graft allegations against him. the government agency said in a written reply in march to members of parliament that the investigation on taib is still ongoing. the former chief minister wasnt involved in decisions to award any project or land to his family members, according to findings made so far by the commission. taib had denied the corruption allegations and has never been charged. expedite investigations the commission said in 2013 it established a task force to expedite investigations into allegations of graft against taib. global witness, a london-based anti-corruption campaign group partly funded by billionaire investor george soros, released a video purporting to expose corrupt dealings in the state by his family members. i think its a bit a naughty of them, taib told reporters in kuching of global witness in a youtube post by fz.com, which runs a news website. they are using their big power to blacken my name. under taib, sarawak reduced its dependence on mining, agriculture and forestry by developing its manufacturing and renewable energy industries. the state accounts for about 10 percent of malaysias gross domestic product, according to government data. the legal tussle between his son and his ex-wife, shahnaz abdul majid, has been playing out in court and the malaysian media since their divorce in 2011. sex deprived shahnaz, who has an mba in finance, told the shariah, or islamic, high court in kuala lumpur in september that she was deprived of sex for a decade and said mahmud had wed an australian and, later, a russian without her knowledge during their 19-year marriage. under malaysian law, its legal for muslim men to marry as many as four wives. mahmud is the deputy chairman of kuala lumpur-listed cahya mata sarawak bhd., the largest infrastructure group in sarawak. he personally controls assets valued at about $300 million, according to forensic accounting firm ferrier hodgsons malaysian venture, which shahnaz hired. he has stakes in 49 companies, according to documents presented by the accounting firm in court. the value of holdings held by mahmud could be substantially higher because 18 of those companies are exempted from filing their annual financial statements to regulators and couldnt be valued, andrew heng, a partner at ferrier hodgsons malaysian office, told the court on jan. 22. cahya mata heng was cross-examined by mahmuds lawyer on april 14 and said his report was prepared without bias or external influence, the malaysian star reported. mahmuds father controls 42 percent of cahya mata sarawak through the family holding company, majaharta sdn, and under the names of his children and late wife, lejla taib, according to stock exchange filings. the family became the biggest shareholder in the company, which started as a state-owned cement manufacturer, through a series of acquisitions in the 1990s, transforming it into a conglomerate with interests that included a brokerage and a road construction business, according to aerias report. according to shahnaz, mahmud also may have stakes in 85 companies abroad that havent been valued, her lawyer, rafie mohd shafie, told the court. 85 companies the 85 foreign companies dont exist, mahmud said in response to a bloomberg news query about the valuation of his assets by his ex-wifes accountant, as he walked out of the courtroom on jan. 22, accompanied by a bodyguard. i dont know anyone who has 85 companies. do you know anyone who has 85 companies? mahmud didnt respond to e-mailed questions about familys wealth and the valuation of his assets listed in the divorce settlement court hearings. his father entered politics at age 27, after graduating from the university of adelaide in australia with a law degree in 1960 through a scholarship. the former chief minister belongs to the melanau group, one of about 27 different ethnic groups in sarawak. he held various ministerial positions in sarawak and malaysia before taking over in 1981 as the chief minister from his uncle, abdul rahman yakub. he was diagnosed with early-stage colon cancer and underwent surgery in 2006, bernama reported. his polish-born wife died of cancer in 2009. more than a year later, he married syrian-born ragad kurdi taib, 46 years his junior, the state news agency said.sarawak cable his son, mahmud, is the chairman and biggest shareholder of sarawak cable bhd., a power cable and wire maker, which won transmission line projects from state-owned sarawak energy last year. sarawak cable shares were unchanged at the close in kuala lumpur, while cahya mata sarawak rose 1.8 percent to 9.79 ringgit, the highest in almost two weeks. the governors children have stakes in companies that own more than 36,000 hectares of oil palm land worth about $300 million, according to company and court filings. they also own the hilton adelaide hotel through sitehost pty, which is owned by the family, according to filings with the australian securities & investments commission. in sarawak, the family has interests in the miri marriott resort & spa, which overlooks the south china sea, and another hotel near a unesco world heritage site known for its caves, according to malaysian company filings. u.s. buildings other

lumpur: public bank bhds proposed rights issue to raise up to rm5 billion will help bolster its common equity tier-1 (cet-1) ratio, currently the lowest among malaysian banks, to a level more comparable with its peers. the exercise will, however, dilute its earnings per share (eps) and return on equity (roe). this was why investors immediate reaction to the news announced on tuesday was to sell down the shares. the banks share pricefell by as much 1.4% to rm19.88, before gaining some ground to close at rm20.14 on wednesday, just 0.1% lower than the previous days price. the counter was actively traded with some 11.6 million shares changing hands, about 3u00bd times more than that in the previous day. what is positive is that this fundraising would bolster its cet-1 ratio to a comfortable 10.4% thereafter, maybank investment bank (maybank ib) research said in a note on wednesday. we estimate the financial impact to be a 7% dilution to financial year 2015 (fy15) eps and a dilution in the groups fy15 return on average equity from [earlier expectations of] 19.1% to 17.7%, it said. it maintained its sell call and target price of rm18.00 on the stock. cet-1 provides the benchmark on how banks are well-capitalised. public banks cet-1 ratio stood at 8.5% as at end-march, much lower than the industry average of over 12.8%, but comfortably above the minimum 7% that banks need to meet by 2019, as per bank negara malaysias (bnm) basel iii requirements. however, bnm is also considering introducing counter-cyclical capital buffers, which may eventually push up the minimum requirement further. analysts said this may be pushed up by 2.5% at the most. it had been long expected that public bank would need to raise funds to boost itscapital position and it had hinted to analysts that such a move would be done via a rights issue, as opposed to a private placement of new shares. bigger rival cimb group holdings bhd earlier this year opted for a private placement, raising rm3.55 billion to strengthen its capital position. however, analysts were surprised that public bank had decided to undertake the rights issue earlier. it comes much earlier than anticipated as the management has often said it would decide only after bank negara sets the counter-cyclical buffer in 2015/2016. that management has decided to bring this forward could be to take advantage of the recent spike in share price, maybank ib research pointed out. public banks share price surged to a multi-year high of rm20.80 on april 4, following a four-day uptrend during which it gained 8.6%. the interest came after the banks announcement on march 31 that it would merge its local and foreign shares on april 16, a move which lifted its investible weighting on ftses value-stocks asean index. we believe that this is an opportune time to undertake such an exercise given that its share price is riding high which will help to minimise the eps dilution impact, hong leong investment bank research said, adding that it was neutral to slightly positive on the rights issue. public bank said the rights issue would be at a discount of 20% to 35% to its theoretical ex-rights price. the exercise is expected to be completed by the third quarter.  public bank says the rights issue will be at a discount of 20% to 35% to its theoretical ex-rights price and the exercise is expected to be completed by the third quarter. assuming a price discount of 27% [mid-point between the 20% and 35% discount] and a volume weighted average price of rm19.97, we estimate a 1-for-10 rights issue to raise the rm5 billion, maybank ib research said. according to bloomberg data, at least 27 analysts that track public banks stock, most of them (15) have a hold, with seven maintaining a sell and the rest, a buy. analysts said public banks roe, the highest among local banks, has peaked and is now on a declining trend. its roe stood at 20.5% as at march 31. hwangdbs vickers research forecast that the groups roe would be around 19% following the rights issue, which it said is still the highest among malaysian banks. it maintained its buy call on the stock. after the rights issue, pbb investors will no longer need to worry about the bank not meeting the basel iii requirements. in addition, its management will be able to focus solely on growing the business, it said. the research house expects public banks dividend payout ratio (dpr) to stop sliding and assumes that it will be sustainable at 40% up to fy18. the groups dpr has been on a declining trend since fy09, slipping to 44.8% last year, its lowest in about a decade. this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on may 2, 2014."}, "727": {"date_posted": "2/5/2014", "title": "#highlight* nestle sees slower sales

a flat food and beverage (f&b) market, said its managing director alois hofbauer. hofbauer, who is also the groups regional head for malaysia and singapore, said the situation is expected to last for a certain period until consumers get used to the new prices of nestle products and resume their previous buying patterns. i think the reality will be that you may see a faster value (pricing) growth

quarter ended march 31 of financial year 2014 (1qfy14). it recently announced that it will be raising the prices of its milo range by 5% to 7% this month. hofbauer, however, stressed that the group had turned to increasing the prices of its products as a last resort as it copes with rising prices of milk, coffee and cocoa, which make up the bulk of its raw material costs. nestle malaysias revenue grew in the range of 5.1% to 7.5% for the past five years, from fy09 to fy13. for 1qfy14, the group recorded a 3.7% increase in revenue to rm1.27 billion, buoyed by a 9.2% rise in domestic performance. domestic sales accounted for 75% of the groups revenue last year. for 1qfy14, the groups gross margin rose slightly to 37.2% from 36.5% a year ago. hofbauer said the group sees slight impact from the flattish f&b market as consumer sentiment weakens due to rising inflation. he, however, assured that the impact on the groups earnings is not material as there will still be demand for nestle products. we are in a business where most people need to eat and drink. yes, there is negative impact (from inflation), but are you going to stop drinking milo, or stop having maggie mee? he asked. he noted that malaysians overall disposable income for food is still manageable, adding that the drop in the groups sales volume was much worse during the global financial crisis of 2008. when you talk about our (f&b) industry, yes, there will be an impact if the whole economy slows down, but its still a safer place to be than lets say, luxury goods or fashion. while any price increase is done sensitively to manage any adverse impact, hofbauer said the group is also mindful of offering value-up products, that is, giving more to its consumers for the same amount of money. this is done through continuous renovation and innovation of its product line. moving forward, nestle malaysia will remain focused on growing its net profit and revenue as it continues to deliver the nestle model which seeks 5% to 6% organic growth annually. the group has allocated rm280 million in capital expenditure (capex) this year, the bulk of which will go to its new sri muda factory in shah alam, selangor, which will boost the capacity of its ready-to-drink segment by 75%. it is worth noting that its capex for 2014 is the highest in five years. nestle malaysia currently has 500 products under its portfolio, and sells almost eight million products daily, said hofbauer. while it is hard to generalise the growth attributed by various product categories as they each have a different base, hofbauer said: what we have seen in the last few years in malaysia is that convenience and ready-to-drink offerings tend to grow faster than some of our more traditional products. he noted that there are no products that fall below the managements performance expectations. meanwhile, hofbauer said the group still allocates the bulk of its advertising money to the traditional media. but as

pt bank cimb niaga tbk. it expects the corporate segment to lift cimb niagas loan growth to the low- to mid-teens this year versus 2013s 8%, while the guided net interest margin (nim) compression of 20 basis points (bps) to 30bps for 2014 will be significantly smaller than the 57bps nim decline in 2013. funding cost remains the main source of nim pressure, but in mitigation, management has seen time deposit rates ease by about 100bps compared to last years peak. asset quality remains stable, and there was no change to the 80bps to 100bps credit cost guidance. generally, there were no major issues in terms of asset quality, and management has not noted any systemic issues. cimb group retained its group credit cost expectations of 30bps to 40bps for 2014 (2013: 30bps). it guided for group nim compression of 5bps to 15bps this year (2013: -19bps). the rather wide range mainly boils down to the extent to which cimb niagas nim behaves. cimb group expects margins for the retail businesses in malaysia, thailand and singapore to be stable. the first quarter of 2014 (1q14) thus far has seen healthy activities for the debt capital market and treasury (rates and foreign exchange) divisions. equities had a slower quarter in 1q14, but management said the pipeline was strong and much would depend on market conditions. on the whole, with management largely keeping its outlook intact, we are also retaining our view on the group. cimb group offers strong leverage to the expected pick-up in corporate lending as well as capital market activities, which we believe will be well supported by the ongoing roll-out of projects under the various economic programmes. other potential rerating catalysts include asset quality holding steady, capital overhang being removed and cost restructuring initiatives bearing fruit. hence, we retain our buy recommendation on the stock. we retain our earnings forecasts. while we have switched our valuation methodology to the gordon growth model from the one based on price-earnings ratio, there is no change to our target price of rm8.50. cimb group is an excellent proxy to the ongoing roll-out of the economic transformation programme and capital

in eastern ukraine, as pro-moscow rebels showed no sign of curbing their uprising, seizing public buildings in another town in the east. on the earnings front, shares in bayer jumped 4.7 percent after posting forecast-beating quarterly results. despite bayer, the overall earnings picture for europe remains mixed. about one-fifth of companies of the stoxx europe 600 index have reported quarterly

it. in mid-may, the jack-up will start servicing a six-week us$7 million (rm22.82 million) drilling contract awarded by nido petroleum ltd for work in the philippines. the contract value translates into an attractive daily charter rate of approximately us$165,000 due to the short work period. we are encouraged by umw-ogs fleet expansion programme, which has been throwing up positive scheduling surprises. a one-month early delivery of naga 7 could raise our financial year 2014 ending dec 31 (fy14) earnings per share by 2%. management is scouting for a second contract for naga 5 and first

points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like cimb group holdings bhd, genting bhd, malayan banking bhd, petronas dagangan bhd and public bank bhd caused the index to inch up on some institutional buying. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a

very heavy selling. its simple moving averages depict an emerging uptrend for its weekly and monthly charts. its daily chart had turned neutral this week though. due to its mixed chart signals, we believe investors will change to a range trading mode for the klci. due to the fine tone for the klci, we are recommending a chart buy on yee lee corp bhd, which announced its fourth quarter ended dec 31 of financial year 2013 (4qfy13) and full-year results in february 2014. the group saw its full fy13 revenue declining marginally by 5.9% to rm658.3 million from rm699.7 million in fy12. despite the marginal decline in top line numbers, yee lee recorded a significant 45.2% improvement in profit before tax to rm42.7 million in fy13 from rm29.4 million in fy12. the improved profitability can be attributed to the trading division, which performed exceptionally well in fy13, and the palm oil refinery and mill division which managed to report a turnaround. its subsidiary, spritzer bhd, also recorded a substantial increase in profit contribution to the group to rm6.3 million in fy13 from rm4.4 million in fy12. a check of bloomberg consensus reveals that only two research houses cover the stock with buy calls. the stock is currently trading at a fair historical price-earnings ratio of 9.98 times and reasonable price-to-book value of 1.05 times. yee lee has a low indicative 12-month dividend yield of 1.32%. maybank-ib first featured chart coverage on yee lee on april 10 at rm1.80. its chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames are very strong. its share price made an obvious surge since its daily wave-2 low of rm1.22 on dec 18, 2013. since that rm1.22 low, yee lee surged to its recent april 2014 high of rm1.94. its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to its recent april 2014 high of rm1.94. as it broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of rm1.48 and rm1.73, look to buy yee lee on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to long term uptrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, stochastic and oscillator) are very strong and now

30% stake in qct. we expect the group to roll out new reit injections in the next six to 18 months as it has a few assets in kl sentral that are ready. our financial year 2014 ending dec 31 (fy14) to fy16 earnings per share forecasts and target price are unchanged, still pegged to a revised 20% rnav discount. mrcbs reit story is still relatively fresh in investors minds. the key benefits of the reit strategy are the earnings accretion potential via recurring income growth and value unlocking through rnav. investors should accumulate the stock, especially in light of the other potential rerating catalysts including new job wins.  cimb research, april 15 this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on april 16, 2014."}, "745": {"date_posted": "11/4/2014", "title": "hot

malaysias growth", "article": " tong making a point at the forum. with him are (from left) lim, ho, lewis and song. the global economy is set to recover in the light of improving growth in the us and europe. but what malaysia accomplishes will depend on how developed economies perform, external demand and government policies, say panellists at the edge economic forum 2014 that was held in kuala lumpur on march 8. the speakers at the forum were song seng wun, regional economist at cimb research pte ltd, singapore; geoff lewis, executive director and global market strategist at jp morgan asset management, hong kong; lim suet ling, ceo of uob asset management (m) bhd; and datuk tong kooi ong, executive chairman of the edge media group.  the moderator of the forum was ho kay tat, publisher and ceo of the edge media group. this is a year of recovery for the global economy, which is usually good for risk assets, observes lewis. if america is doing well, its hard to drag down. europe has a lot of structural problems, but its economy is enjoying a cyclical recovery. most german banks are forecasting 1% [gross domestic product] growth in the eurozone, but it could be 1.5%. germany might even exceed 2% this year. song echoes his sentiment, pointing to purchasing managers index (pmi) readings, which are higher in europe than in asean. the pmi indicates the economic health of the manufacturing sector based on five indicators: new orders, inventory levels, production, supplier deliveries and the employment environment. a pmi reading of more than 50 represents an expansion in the manufacturing sector month on month while a reading of below 50 represents a contraction. a reading of 50 indicates no change. the eurozones pmi reading for january was close to 55 while for asia ex-japan, it was below 50. the first quarter of this year could have been quieter because of chinese new year and things could pick up in 2q2014. europe seems busier, but it is coming from a period when its economy was in a steep recession, says song.  asian exports have to pick up pace, without which the markets here will lag behind. asean member states have a fairly large dependency [on external demand], including malaysia, whose key markets are the us and europe. the pmi indicates the direction the economy is taking, explains song. if it is supportive of factory activities, it should translate into stronger export numbers. i look at cargo figures and machine imports are a healthy sign of how things are. apart from being optimistic about the us and european markets, lewis and song are also bullish on japan, although lewis has reservations about china.  we had the first boost from abenomics early last year  amazing growth rates of over 4%  but it didnt last. but we dont underestimate [japans ability] to keep growing; more policy easing will keep growth up in the short term, opines lewis.  there is doubt about china  we have concerns about its quality of growth. it might be sacrificing a bit of growth as it cleans house. most forecasts i see are between 7.25% and 8%. we anticipate 7%, slightly below the official target.  as for developing markets, the forecasts are promising and could provide investing opportunities in selected economies. the unrest in venezuela and ukraine, turkey facing market discipline or indias tightening measures should not pose a threat to the global economy, says lewis. if some are expecting 3.75% world growth, wed take 0.4% off due to [the risks in] emerging markets, bringing it down to 3.3%.  still, investors should not sell their emerging market holdings just yet as several african countries were not as affected by recession. ghana and mozambique [grew] 4.5% and over 5%, tanzania and africa [overall] are doing quite well and there are a few african emerging market funds. cambodia shows strong growth and indonesia didnt really suffer from a recession, lewis points out.  these are viewed by our fund managers as a great bottom-up opportunity. china is at a 25% price-to-book discount and emerging market equities as a group have a price-to-book [value] of below 1.5. historically, this has been a good time for an investor with a longer-term horizon of two to three years. developing markets may hold promise, but there are still gains to be made in the us and developed markets. if youre going to go overweight on developed markets, overweight europe. thats where cyclical momentum is the best and profits are operationally geared to that, lewis says. this is also a good time to go back to japan. theres very little optimism now about abenomics, but dont underestimate japan. its the only developed economy where both the fiscal and monetary authorities are full-on in terms of policy easing. that will probably drive the yen down, which will be reflected in earnings. will an improving us market and the federal reserves tapering of its quantitative easing (qe) programme lead to volatility? not according to lewis, who states that interest rates should be kept low until 2015.  i dont see the markets upset as being the result of tapering; it was more latin american fears: venezuelas 80% credit growth, running out of reserves and signs of hyperinflation, and argentina trying to negotiate itself out of the last debt blowout. after presentations by song and lewis, lim and tong articulated their views on the malaysian market.the stock market  participants listening attentively lim projects a 5% to 5.5% gdp growth for malaysia this year, reiterating that global growth, domestic growth powered by the economic transformation programme and a recovery in exports are crucial for the country. the electrical and electronics industry, in particular, controls a substantial portion of malaysias export numbers.  although inflation, debt and foreign holdings in our local market may shadow the outlook for malaysia, lim thinks the situation is not too bleak.  malaysian household debt as a percentage of gdp has been growing since mid-2000. at 85%, it is the second highest after south korea at above 90%, she points out. the good thing is that malaysian household assets [as a percentage] of gdp are also good, more than 100%. the assets comprise deposits, investments in the market and unit trusts and the employees provident fund (epf) savings. malaysian government debt levels too are increasing, but the expected implementation of the goods and services tax (gst) next year should keep its fiscal deficit of over 4% in check.  the new tax system, however, will contribute to inflation, along with last years food and petrol subsidy cuts, causing higher consumer price index (cpi) numbers in the next six months, according to lim, who sees inflation at 3.1% to 3.5%. the current view is that bank negara malaysia is monitoring the [cpi] numbers before deciding to hike the overnight policy rate. there is still the possibility of a slight hike in the second half of this year, she says. but fiscal consolidation is something our government needs to push through; the short-term pain of gst is a long-term gain. when it comes to malaysias foreign bond holdings, lim says roughly 44% of government securities are held by foreigners, up from around 25% in 2006. the risk lies in a weakening ringgit if bonds continue to sell.  were less worried about the stock market because foreign holdings there are low, she says, adding that the highest percentage of foreign holdings was 27% in 2007. this has dipped to roughly 24% now. as the us recovers and tapering continues, lim expects volatility and continued capital outflow from emerging to developed markets. while there will be withdrawals from our market, the impact will be muted, she opines. when we first heard of qe reductions last may, the philippines, indonesia and thailand bore the brunt of the impact. their yields went up, indicating a withdrawal. the malaysian market was pretty flat as foreigners arent as heavy in our market. we should be fine in the light of the us recovery as we are above the asian average of 0.8%, that is we are positively leveraged to the us, better than indonesia or india. tong, on the other hand, is less optimistic about malaysia due to potential outflow. as the us prints less money and money flows out, what happens to malaysias market will depend on externalities and on how the government manages the country going forward, he explains.  externalities depend on how fast us interest rates go up, the health of the chinese economy and its banking system. they also determine how much time the country has to address capital outflows. increasing fiscal revenue to reduce deficit is a way for malaysia to manage capital outflows. however, the implementation of measures such as gst is easier said than done. politically, they will be difficult to implement and require a lot of political commitment, which is also hard in an environment where we are politically polarised, opines tong. already, real interest rates have gone negative; interest rates in malaysia must rise, but the government and households are already in deep debt. he points out that much of malaysias debt is owed to locals rather than foreigners, which makes the current situation less risky than that in the 1990s. hence, capital outflows are also likely to be triggered by local investors.  those of you in this room are as likely to trigger a capital outflow as foreigners, depending on your outlook of the ringgit. if malaysians begin to lose faith, there is no amount of money in the epf or any other institution that is going to stem the tide. since malaysia is heavily dependent on oil and gas in terms of federal revenue and exports, tong notes that the industry is one to watch. oil production is rising either because of shale gas and oil or the application of fracking technology. the alaskan gas pipeline and tar sands in canada have implications for the future of oil prices, if that is true, he says.  if oil prices are negatively impacted, then there must be implications for malaysia and, to some extent, the oil and gas industry, which is driving malaysias growth. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on march 17, 2014."}, "755": {"date_posted": "21/3/2014", "title": "the edge economic forum 2014: global recovery ahead, but externalities to affect malaysias growth", "article": " tong making a point at the forum. with him are (from left) lim, ho, lewis and song. the global economy is set to recover in the light of improving growth in the us and europe. but what malaysia accomplishes will depend on how developed economies perform, external demand and government policies, say panellists at the edge economic forum 2014 that was held in kuala lumpur on march 8. the speakers at the forum were song seng wun, regional economist at cimb research pte ltd, singapore; geoff lewis, executive director and global market strategist at jp morgan asset management, hong kong; lim suet ling, ceo of uob asset management (m) bhd; and datuk tong kooi ong, executive chairman of the edge media group.  the moderator of the forum was ho kay tat, publisher and ceo of the edge media group. this is a year of recovery for the global economy, which is usually good for risk assets, observes lewis. if america is doing well, its hard to drag down. europe has a lot of structural problems, but its economy is enjoying a cyclical recovery. most german banks are forecasting 1% [gross domestic product] growth in the eurozone, but it could be 1.5%. germany might even exceed 2% this year. song echoes his sentiment, pointing to purchasing managers index (pmi) readings, which are higher in europe than in asean. the pmi indicates the economic health of the manufacturing sector based on five indicators: new orders, inventory levels, production, supplier deliveries and the employment environment. a pmi reading of more than 50 represents an expansion in the manufacturing sector month on month while a reading of below 50 represents a contraction. a reading of 50 indicates no change. the eurozones pmi reading for january was close to 55 while for asia ex-japan, it was below 50. the first quarter of this year could have been quieter because of chinese new year and things could pick up in 2q2014. europe seems busier, but it is coming from a period when its economy was in a steep recession, says song.  asian exports have to pick up pace, without which the markets here will lag behind. asean member states have a fairly large dependency [on external demand], including malaysia, whose key markets are the us and europe. the pmi indicates the direction the economy is taking, explains song. if it is supportive of factory activities, it should translate into stronger export numbers. i look at cargo figures and machine imports are a healthy sign of how things are. apart from being optimistic about the us and european markets, lewis and song are also bullish on japan, although lewis has reservations about china.  we had the first boost from abenomics early last year  amazing growth rates of over 4%  but it didnt last. but we dont underestimate [japans ability] to keep growing; more policy easing will keep growth up in the short term, opines lewis.  there is doubt about china  we have concerns about its quality of growth. it might be sacrificing a bit of growth as it cleans house. most forecasts i see are between 7.25% and 8%. we anticipate 7%, slightly below the official target.  as for developing markets, the forecasts are promising and could provide investing opportunities in selected economies. the unrest in venezuela and ukraine, turkey facing market discipline or indias tightening measures should not pose a threat to the global economy, says lewis. if some are expecting 3.75% world growth, wed take 0.4% off due to [the risks in] emerging markets, bringing it down to 3.3%.  still, investors should not sell their emerging market holdings just yet as several african countries were not as affected by recession. ghana and mozambique [grew] 4.5% and over 5%, tanzania and africa [overall] are doing quite well and there are a few african emerging market funds. cambodia shows strong growth and indonesia didnt really suffer from a recession, lewis points out.  these are viewed by our fund managers as a great bottom-up opportunity. china is at a 25% price-to-book discount and emerging market equities as a group have a price-to-book [value] of below 1.5. historically, this has been a good time for an investor with a longer-term horizon of two to three years. developing markets may hold promise, but there are still gains to be made in the us and developed markets. if youre going to go overweight on developed markets, overweight europe. thats where cyclical momentum is the best and profits are operationally geared to that, lewis says. this is also a good time to go back to japan. theres very little optimism now about abenomics, but dont underestimate japan. its the only developed economy where both the fiscal and monetary authorities are full-on in terms of policy easing. that will probably drive the yen down, which will be reflected in earnings. will an improving us market and the federal reserves tapering of its quantitative easing (qe) programme lead to volatility? not according to lewis, who states that interest rates should be kept low until 2015.  i dont see the markets upset as being the result of tapering; it was more latin american fears: venezuelas 80% credit growth, running out of reserves and signs of hyperinflation, and argentina trying to negotiate itself out of the last debt blowout. after presentations by song and lewis, lim and tong articulated their views on the malaysian market.the stock market  participants listening attentively lim projects a 5% to 5.5% gdp growth for malaysia this year, reiterating that global growth, domestic growth powered by the economic transformation programme and a recovery in exports are crucial for the country. the electrical and electronics industry, in particular, controls a substantial portion of malaysias export numbers.  although inflation, debt and foreign holdings in our local market may shadow the outlook for malaysia, lim thinks the situation is not too bleak.  malaysian household debt as a percentage of gdp has been growing since mid-2000. at 85%, it is the second highest after south korea at above 90%, she points out. the good thing is that malaysian household assets [as a percentage] of gdp are also good, more than 100%. the assets comprise deposits, investments in the market and unit trusts and the employees provident fund (epf) savings. malaysian government debt levels too are increasing, but the expected implementation of the goods and services tax (gst) next year should keep its fiscal deficit of over 4% in check.  the new tax system, however, will contribute to inflation, along with last years food and petrol subsidy cuts, causing higher consumer price index (cpi) numbers in the next six months, according to lim, who sees inflation at 3.1% to 3.5%. the current view is that bank negara malaysia is monitoring the [cpi] numbers before deciding to hike the overnight policy rate. there is still the possibility of a slight hike in the second half of this year, she says. but fiscal consolidation is something our government needs to push through; the short-term pain of gst is a long-term gain. when it comes to malaysias foreign bond holdings, lim says roughly 44% of government securities are held by foreigners, up from around 25% in 2006. the risk lies in a weakening ringgit if bonds continue to sell.  were less worried about the stock market because foreign holdings there are low, she says, adding that the highest percentage of foreign holdings was 27% in 2007. this has dipped to roughly 24% now. as the us recovers and tapering continues, lim expects volatility and continued capital outflow from emerging to developed markets. while there will be withdrawals from our market, the impact will be muted, she opines. when we first heard of qe reductions last may, the philippines, indonesia and thailand bore the brunt of the impact. their yields went up, indicating a withdrawal. the malaysian market was pretty flat as foreigners arent as heavy in our market. we should be fine in the light of the us recovery as we are above the asian average of 0.8%, that is we are positively leveraged to the us, better than indonesia or india. tong, on the other hand, is less optimistic about malaysia due to potential outflow. as the us prints less money and money flows out, what happens to malaysias market will depend on externalities and on how the government manages the country going forward, he explains.  externalities depend on how fast us interest rates go up, the health of the chinese economy and its banking system. they also determine how much time the country has to address capital outflows. increasing fiscal revenue to reduce deficit is a way for malaysia to manage capital outflows. however, the implementation of measures such as gst is easier said than done. politically, they will be difficult to implement and require a lot of political commitment, which is also hard in an environment where we are politically polarised, opines tong. already, real interest rates have gone negative; interest rates in malaysia must rise, but the government and households are already in deep debt. he points out that much of malaysias debt is owed to locals rather than foreigners, which makes the current situation less risky than that in the 1990s. hence, capital outflows are also likely to be triggered by local investors.  those of you in this room are as likely to trigger a capital outflow as foreigners, depending on your outlook of the ringgit. if malaysians begin to lose faith, there is no amount of money in the epf or any other institution that is going to stem the tide. since malaysia is heavily dependent on oil and gas in terms of federal revenue and exports, tong notes that the industry is one to watch. oil production is rising either because of shale gas and oil or the application of fracking technology. the alaskan gas pipeline and tar sands in canada have implications for the future of oil prices, if that is true, he says.  if oil prices are negatively impacted, then there must be implications for malaysia and, to some extent, the oil and gas industry, which is driving malaysias growth. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on march 17, 2014."}, "756": {"date_posted": "21/3/2014", "title": "#stock focus* slower sales and

pack if the current dry spell continues, or worse, develops into an el niu00f1o. dorab mistry, renowned analyst and director of godrej international ltd, believes that if an el niu00f1o does develop, crude palm oil (cpo) prices could skyrocket to rm3,500 per tonne by late this year. last thursday, the three-month cpo futures contract closed at rm2,845. the proceedings of the national academy of sciences of the united states of america, the official journal of the united states national academy of sciences, says there is a 76% chance of an el niu00f1o occurring later this year. this weather pattern typically lasts 9 to 12 months and parches much of southeast asia and northern australia. should this happen, plantation companies will gain from higher cpo prices. however, the benefits for those with young palms reaching maturity are expected to be even bigger as this group of companies could ride production growth as well as higher average selling prices. the risk of lower fresh fruit bunch (ffb) production due to hot weather can be offset by young palms, says publicinvest research analyst chong hoe leong. usually, planters have only one option  cpo price or production. the biggest winners will, of course, be those planters with strong ffb production growth, palms with a young age profile and location in unaffected areas. he adds that big market capitalisation companies with palms in their prime, such as sime darby bhd, kuala lumpur kepong bhd and ioi corp, will enjoy higher cpo prices, but they will also suffer declining production. if higher prices are due to lower supply, planters may lose out because a 50% rise in cpo prices will not offset the earnings impact of a 50% drop in output, cautions cimb research plantation analyst saw xiao jun. one cannot be certain how much of the possibility of an el niu00f1o the market has factored into current cpo prices, saw adds. it seems that the market has turned from underweighting bad weather to overweighting it. in just over a month, cpo futures have risen 13% and closed at rm2,845 per tonne last thursday. by mistrys estimates, cpo prices could go up to rm3,000 per tonne by june if weather conditions improve. if rains return to normal, the prices will range from rm2,600 to rm2,900 from july to october, he forecast at the palm and lauric oils conference last wednesday. in the event that an el niu00f1o develops, i believe cpo futures will cling to rm3,000 beyond june [2014], he said. without unusual weather conditions, however, there is limited upside potential for cpo prices, said thomas mielke, executive director of ista mielke gmbh oil world. cpo prices in rotterdam could touch or slightly exceed us$1,000 in the next four to eight weeks, he said at the same conference. he expects cpo prices to average us$970 this year. without unusual weather conditions, there is limited upside potential for cpo prices but to an analyst with a local bank-backed research house, the pertinent question is, how certain are we of an impending el niu00f1o, and if there is one, how long will it last? what we are looking at is not an immediate impact, but rather a laggard impact on output in 9 to 12 months. for planters with palms with a young age profile, there should be less disruption to total production, she says. the problem for investors is that, overall, the sector has seen valuations creep up in recent months. but some fund managers have noticed that the valuations of the smaller planters are relatively cheaper than those of the big boys.when looking at malaysia-listed plantation companies with palms with a young age profile, the names that crop up include ta ann holdings bhd, sarawak oil palms bhd (sop), tsh resources bhd, th plantations bhd (thp), tdm bhd, kretam holdings bhd, ijm plantations bhd (ijmp), jaya tiasa holdings bhd and genting plantations bhd (see table 1). of these, ta ann, sop and thp are based in sarawak and recently hogged the limelight for the wrong reasons. wilmar international ltd recently made known its new no peat, no deforestation, no exploitation policy, which means it will stop buying cpo from oil palm companies that plant on peat swampland from 2016 onwards. it is unclear how this will impact the market in sarawak, but so far, ta ann has said it will complete its peat plantings by the dec 31, 2015, deadline.sop, on the other hand, has its own refining capacity and is unaffected by wilmars policy. ta ann seems to be the favourite of analysts, who say the stock is still cheap at current prices. it is trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of under 14 times, lower than that for other companies with young palms (see table 2). about 9,000ha or 26% of ta anns planted hectarage comprises young and immature

also like genting plantations and tsh as all three are pure upstream planters and have double-digit ffb production growth. tsh has among the youngest palms on the market with 76% of its land planted with immature trees, but its stock is getting pricey, say analysts. genting plantations too has immature trees  on 42% of its landbank. it posted a net profit of rm227.8 million in fy2013 while tsh

growth, palms with a young age profile and location in unaffected areas. he adds that big market capitalisation companies with palms in their prime, such as sime darby bhd, kuala lumpur kepong bhd and ioi corp, will enjoy higher cpo prices, but they will also suffer declining production. if higher prices are due to lower supply, planters may lose out because a 50% rise in cpo prices will not offset the earnings impact of a 50% drop in output, cautions cimb research plantation analyst saw xiao jun. one cannot be certain how much of the possibility of an el niu00f1o the market has factored into current cpo prices, saw adds. it seems that the market has turned from underweighting bad weather to overweighting it. in just over a month, cpo futures have risen 13% and closed at rm2,845 per tonne last thursday. by mistrys estimates, cpo prices could go up to rm3,000 per tonne by june if weather conditions improve. if rains return to normal, the prices will range from rm2,600 to rm2,900 from july to october, he forecast at the palm and lauric oils conference last wednesday. in the event that an el niu00f1o develops, i believe cpo futures will cling to rm3,000 beyond june [2014], he said. without unusual weather conditions, however, there is limited upside potential for cpo prices, said thomas mielke, executive director of ista mielke gmbh oil world. cpo prices in rotterdam could touch or slightly exceed us$1,000 in the next four to eight weeks, he said at the same conference. he expects cpo prices to average us$970 this year. without unusual weather conditions, there is limited upside potential for cpo prices but to an analyst with a local bank-backed research house, the pertinent question is, how certain are we of an impending el niu00f1o, and if there is one, how long will it last? what we are looking at is not an immediate impact, but rather a laggard impact on output in 9 to 12 months. for planters with palms with a young age profile, there should be less disruption to total production, she says. the problem for investors is that, overall, the sector has seen valuations creep up in recent months. but some fund managers have noticed that the valuations of the smaller planters are relatively cheaper than those of the big boys.when looking at malaysia-listed plantation companies with palms with a young age profile, the names that crop up include ta ann holdings bhd, sarawak oil palms bhd (sop), tsh resources bhd, th plantations bhd (thp), tdm bhd, kretam holdings bhd, ijm plantations bhd (ijmp), jaya tiasa holdings bhd and genting plantations bhd (see table 1). of these, ta ann, sop and thp are based in sarawak and recently hogged the limelight for the wrong reasons. wilmar international ltd recently made known its new no peat, no deforestation, no exploitation policy, which means it will stop buying cpo from oil palm companies that plant on peat swampland from 2016 onwards. it is unclear how this will impact the market in sarawak, but so far, ta ann has said it will complete its peat plantings by the dec 31, 2015, deadline.sop, on the other hand, has its own refining capacity and is unaffected by wilmars policy. ta ann seems to be the favourite of analysts, who say the stock is still cheap at current prices. it is trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of under 14 times, lower than that for other companies with young palms (see table 2). about 9,000ha or 26% of ta anns planted hectarage comprises young and immature palms. the company has been on an upward trend, raking in a net profit of rm92.06 million in fy2013 ended dec 31 compared with rm57.46 million the year before (see table 3). besides ta ann, analysts also like genting plantations and tsh as all three are pure upstream planters and have double-digit ffb production growth. tsh has among the youngest palms on the market with 76% of its land planted with immature trees, but its stock is getting pricey, say analysts. genting plantations too has immature trees  on 42% of its landbank. it posted a net profit of rm227.8 million in fy2013 while tsh made rm153.1 million, up from rm77.03 million in fy2012. this article first appeared in

as china reported slower than estimated industrial production and retail sales growth. chinas latest industrial output expanded 8.6%, which was lower than the 9.5% estimated by analysts surveyed by bloomberg. chinas retail sales advanced 11.8% and this was at the slowest pace for january and february since 2004. chinas export concerns also affected the american stock markets and indices there ended up little changed from tuesday. the sp 500 index inched up a mere 0.57 of a point to close at 1,868.2 points while the dow lost 11.17 points to end at 16,340.08 on wednesday night. the fbm klci traded in a narrow range of 15.24 points for the week with lower volumes of 1.61 billion to 1.71 billion shares done. the index closed at 1,818.86 yesterday, up a mere 0.26 of a point from the previous day as blue chip stocks like cimb group holdings bhd, kuala lumpur kepong bhd, petronas dagangan bhd, public bank bhd and rhb capital bhd caused the index to inch up yesterday. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the index price movement in the next few months following may 2013 was trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low) and 1,838.69 (high). the indexs daily signals (like cci, dmi, macd and stochastic) are mainly negative except the oscillator. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at 1,769, 1,799 and 1,813, while the resistance areas of 1,818, 1,839 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some very heavy selling activities. our rebound retracement target of 1,839.26 (62% level) capped the index on march 6. as the index could not penetrate above this key level, it has thrown the klcis onus to the downside, with critical supports of 1,813 and 1,800 in focus again. its simple moving averages (ma) depict a neutral trend for its daily and weekly charts. due to its weaker chart signals, we believe investors will adopt a take profit on rallies philosophy for the klci. due to the softer tone for the klci, we are recommending a chart sell on malaysia airport holdings bhd (mahb), which announced that it has not received the certificate of completion and compliance (ccc) for klia2, which was due on jan 31. a delay in the may 2 opening of klia2 looks imminent, given that the operational readiness and airport transfer (orat) normally takes three to six months to complete post the issuance of the ccc. klia2 is set to be mahbs biggest earnings driver for the year and much optimism on the stock is premised on the project being on track. it is now uncertain when klia2 will be ready for operations and our analyst doubts that the rm4 billion capital expenditure budget is on target. our maybank ib analyst has downgraded mahb to sell with a target price of rm7.03 based on a 2014 price-earnings ratio (per) of 20.5 times bringing near-term valuations more in line with its peers. a check on bloomberg consensus reveals 18 brokers covering the stock. of the 18 research houses that cover the stock, five have a buy call, seven sell and six hold. the stock is currently trading at a high historical per of 25.1 times and a high price-to-book value of 2.11 times. mahbs price trends on the daily chart are weaker. its share price made an obvious decline since its daily wave-5 and all-time high of rm9.78 in december 2013. since that rm9.78 high, mahb declined to its recent february 2014 low of rm7.87. its chart has moved into an obvious daily downtrend to its recent february 2014 low of rm7.87. as it broke below its recent key critical support levels of rm9.43 and rm8.62, look to sell mahb on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to medium term downtrends for this stock. the daily indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, oscillator and stochastic) are very negative and now depict the obvious indications of mahbs eventual move towards much lower levels. we expect mahb to remain weaker towards its support levels of rm6.90, rm7.87 and rm7.90. it will attract heavy liquidation at the resistance levels of rm8.08, rm8.62 and rm9.78. its downside retracement targets are now

said the society of remisiers, which represents dealers who work entirely on commission. singapore exchange ltd. and the monetary authority of singapore proposed the changes after a penny-stock rout in october erased $6.9 billion in market value of three companies over three days. more people will leave the industry as theyll get less business, jimmy ho, president of the society of remisiers, said by phone. once they cut the settlement period, there will be less speculative trading and it will drag overall volumes. the number of stockbrokers in singapore fell 8.4 percent percent to 3,973 at the end of last year from 4,336 in 2011, according to data from the bourse, as the industry was buffeted by declining trading volumes and commissions as well as competition from online trading platforms. the citys benchmark straits times index trailed all its major developed-market peers in the past 12 months and slid 1.8 percent this year. even after singapore exchange teamed with singapore management university and cimb group holdings bhd. in april 2012 to provide training programs for the industry, traders ranks continued to thin. this year, the bourse partnered with the national trade union congresss employment & employability institute to bolster interest in the profession. industry adjustment brokerages are able to cope with fewer dealers because trading volumes are lower, society of remisiers ho said. thats a natural adjustment for the industry. it will be hard to draw young people, given the high risk and low commissions, said yeo aiqi, 28, who left phillip securities pte, the citys biggest brokerage by clients, in 2011 after working three years there. stockbroking appears to be a sunset industry, yeo, who now sells womens apparel at her online store

japans topix index increased 17 percent. stock rout blumont group ltd., asiasons capital ltd. and liongold corp. tumbled at least 87 percent over three days in october, prompting the city-states central bank and bourse to review its equity market structure. the companies said they didnt know what precipitated the plunges, which spurred at least a dozen lawsuits from banks and brokers seeking to recover losses on collateral held against margin loans. sgx introduced circuit breakers last month to minimize volatility in share prices and is seeking feedback from the industry before it implements the collateral and settlement period changes. while the move is meant to revive investor confidence, it wont improve the outlook for brokers, said gabriel yap, who left the industry in 2009 after 19 years as a trader. the casualties of the penny-stock saga are the stockbrokers, yap, who now manages his own investment advisory firm, said by phone. if the clients dont pay, the dealers or the remisiers will have to cover. shrinking commissions to make the profession more appealing, sgx needs to address dwindling volumes to counter the decline in brokerage commission rates, which have fallen to 0.1 percent of the value of shares traded from 1 percent 10 years ago, according to yap. brokers have nothing exciting to recommend to their clients these days, yap said. trading was buoyant before i left the industry due to the influx of chinese listings and now investors are avoiding such companies after a number of them got embroiled in accounting or stock manipulation scandals. sgx promoted the listing of real estate investment trusts in the past decade but interest in them is starting to wane. at least 28 chinese firms on the exchange have been suspended or delisted since 2008.

topline. however, topline growth did not flow through to the bottom line, due to higher depreciation that caused pre-tax margins to contract to 6%. we await further developments on nncbs new ventures, but are not perturbed by delays in these projects, as they will enable it to accumulate cash from existing core it operations, to beef up its balance sheet. we expect 2hfy14 to be weaker, due to

months, this was accompanied by a sharp deterioration in yields. what is worrying is that the significant growth in passengers handled, did not result in economies of scale, as unit costs barely budged. we think that mas is still trying to find its footing, following its entry into the oneworld alliance, with more efforts focusing on costs, only in 2014. the fourth quarter is traditionally the strongest one for mas, due to the seasonally stronger traffic spurred by the holiday season. however, as we highlighted earlier, we remain doubtful about its cost-cutting efforts, at least in

in re capacity, to act as a catalyst for the stock. fy10/13 revenue grew 10.9% y-o-y to rm217.1 million, thanks to higher revenue from environmental engineering and re services. the environmental engineering divisions revenue grew, driven by the various re-related projects that it undertook during the year. the fourfold growth in its re revenue was mainly due to the increase in its export capacity of green electricity, to tenaga. we expect the re revenue growth momentum to persist in fy14, as cypark continues to expand its re capacity. cypark expects to secure additional re quota in the future, as the government aims to increase the generation capacity to between 5% and 6% of total generation capacity, by 2015, from 2% currently. this augurs well for cypark, as it is one of the largest re players here. kim loong resources bhdtarget price: rm2.62 neutral alliance research (jan 2): kim loong reported 3qfy14 and 9mfy14 net profit of rm15.7 million and rm41.2 million, respectively. results are expected to improve further in 4qfy14, as crude palm oil prices have trended higher q-o-q. its 9mfy14 net profit improved mildly by 3.3% y-o-y, as the uptick in production helped to offset lower cpo prices, during the period. there was also a recovery in profit from the milling segment in 3qfy14, which boosted net profit. going into 2014, we expect cpo prices to trend higher than in 2013, as market fundamentals are favourable. the upcoming production down cycle will keep cpo prices buoyant in 1q14, while biodiesel demand will keep inventories well-managed throughout the year, helping to offset export weakness. our target price for kim loong is raised to rm2.62, from rm2.22 previously. this implies a target per of 13 times, pegged to fy15 eps. kim loong currently does not have major tracts of new maturities, that can drive organic growth. we view the stock as fully-valued at current levels. cahya mata sarawak bhdtarget price: rm7.70 buy maybank ib

stirring sales", "article": " (mar 4): moodys investors service predicts basel iii-compliant islamic bond sales from malaysia will gather momentum after the debut issue by amislamic bank bhd. won a lower coupon rate than notes sold by the sister company. amislamic bank sold 200 million ringgit ($61 million) of tier 2 basel iii debt due in 2024 at a yield of 5.07 percent last week, compared with the 5.2 percent ambank (m) bhd. paid for similar bonds in december that dont comply with the korans ban on interest. rhb capital bhd. is also planning to issue as much as 1 billion ringgit of the sukuk, according to a stock exchange filing which didnt specify the timing. lenders selling islamic bonds to shore up their balance sheets in accordance with tighter guidelines from the basel committee on banking supervision will help address the shortage of new sukuk, according to the malaysia international islamic financial centre. banks in the middle east started issuing basel iii tier 1 shariah-compliant bonds in november 2012, when abu dhabi islamic bank pjsc sold $1 billion of perpetual notes. amislamic banks sukuk pricing looks interesting because it highlights that investors are eager to purchase these instruments even though the yields are relatively low, eugene tarzimanov, singapore-based vice-president at moodys, said in a feb. 28 telephone interview. there will be more such basel iii sukuk from malaysia and the middle east as islamic banks are growing rapidly and need new capital. basel requirements the basel committee issued rules in 2010 to boost banks capital-adequacy ratios and give them an extra buffer against losses following the global financial crisis that erupted in 2008. lenders around the world have until 2019 to comply with the new standards, which include a clause allowing regulators to write-off capital, such as subordinated debt, if the issuer is in danger of becoming insolvent, or non-viable. malayan banking bhd., cimb group holdings bhd., public bank bhd., ambank and amislamic bank have all sold tier 2 basel iii bonds in the southeast asian nation totaling $1.6 billion, taking issuance to one islamic and four non-shariah-compliant notes. tier 1 capital consists of common equity and additional securities that have equity-like characteristics such as having no fixed maturity, while tier 2 includes debt with a minimum maturity of 10 years. islamic lenders in malaysia have only just started coming up with the right structures for basel iii bonds that comply with both shariah law and the basel committees rules, moodys tarzimanov said. expand horizons there is ample opportunity to innovate new types of basel iii sukuk that can address the capital adequacy needs of islamic banks, according to a report on the malaysia international islamic financial centres website. such innovation offers the potential for shariah-compliant debt underwriters to increase market share and boost the supply of sukuk, it said. an additional market segment of basel iii-compliant sukuk that satisfy regulatory requirements can expand the horizons and usability of sukuk as financial instruments, the mifc said. global issuance of islamic bonds, which pay returns on assets to comply with the ban on interest, climbed 33 percent to $7.6 billion this year after reaching $43 billion in 2013, the second-highest on record after an unprecedented $46.5 billion in 2012, according to data compiled by bloomberg. in malaysia, the worlds biggest sukuk market, sales rose 37 percent to 9.7 billion ringgit this year, according to data compiled by bloomberg. they reached 49 billion ringgit last year, down from 2012s record 95.8 billion ringgit. in the middle east, issuers have sold $6 billion of both tier 1 and tier 2 basel iii notes, data compiled by bloomberg show. lenders in the persian gulf started issuing tier 2 securities in december 2013. favorable demand the amislamic sukuk will set a pricing benchmark for future basel iii issuance from malaysia, khoo poh sim, a senior portfolio manager at bnp paribas investment partners najimah, who helps oversee 554 million euros ($761 million), said in a feb. 28 e-mail interview. we believe the requirement for such sukuk remains strong this year, anchored by favorable demand and supply factors. amislamic banks basel iii sukuk are based on the murabaha concept and are backed by commodity contracts, mohd. effendi abdullah, head of islamic markets at kuala lumpur-based aminvestment bank bhd., the sole arranger for the offering, said in a feb. 28 phone interview. murabaha is based on a three-party arrangement, where the customer places an order with a financial institution to purchase goods from a supplier and sells them back to the client at a mark-up. amislamic banks notes also include the principle of ibra, which is the act of surrendering ones claims and rights to an asset in the event the securities are deemed non- viable by the central bank, mohd. effendi said. we spent quite a bit of time with shariah advisers and regulators to come out with a structure that incorporates the non-viability clause, mohd. effendi said. this will make it

to the increase in crude palm oil (cpo) and palm kernel prices and the increase in share of results of our associate in indonesia which are offset by the lower fresh fruit bunch (ffb) production caused by weather disruption. also, its resource-based manufacturing profit was higher at rm259.7 million. the higher profit of the segment was due to higher margin from all sub-segments as well as

revenue of rm3.797 billion was 9% higher than 3qfy13, but net profit was 2.3% lower quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) at rm1.038 billion owing to a 54% q-o-q increase in loan impairment. on the banking

factors rose from 74.7% to a commendable 81%. the airline, however, saw its costs for fy13 growing much quicker. the losses were pinned on higher fuel costs as the ringgit weakened by 4.7%

not bode well for mas either. as at yesterday, the ringgit had weakened further to 3.2802 against the greenback. in addition, mas will have to contend with increased competition both domestically and internationally. our survey of announced capacity schedules up to july 2014 indicates that mas (and airasia x bhd) is struggling to digest a huge expansion of capacity to australia in late 2013/early

statement. the rest of it was borne equally by petroliam nasional bhd and the government.  with analysts concurring that the increase of 0.9 sen per kwh in base tariff, will have a positive effect on tenagas bottom line, the structured warrants could be a cheaper way to gain entry into the surging utility stock. based on their closing prices on dec 11, 2013, tenaga-c5 and tenaga-c6 are trading at a discount to the underlying share. tenaga-c5  which expires on aug 29, 2014, and has a conversion ratio of six warrants to one underlying share  closed at 35.5 sen. this means, it is trading at a 1.5% discount to the underlying share, which closed at rm11.30.  tenaga-c6 matures on june 30, 2014, and has a conversion ratio of 12 warrants to one underlying share. based on its closing price of 15.5 sen on dec 11, 2013, it is trading at a low premium of 0.53% to the underlying share. hwangdbs vickers research has raised its target price for tenaga to rm11.40, after upgrading its earnings forecast, because it believes that the tariff hike will more-than-compensate for the higher fuel cost. alliance research has also increased its target price for tenaga, from rm11.86 to rm13.  this

project is targeted to start on april 1. the signing of the cstm loa is not a surprise as myegs management has indicated over the past few months that this project is targeted to start nationwide from april onwards. our earnings forecasts already assume that the cstm will start contributing to myegs bottom line from fy15, based on a 20% share of revenue above a pre-set base. initial capital expenditure is rm100 million but myeg indicated that the projects value is rm180 million, with the additional rm80 million being projected operational expenses over the next six years for the consortium handling cstm. myeg has a 40% stake in the consortium. if all goes well for the cstm project over the next few months, myeg will look to implement phase 2, which is expected to include the retail sector, potentially five to 10 times the size of the cstm market. we have not assumed any earnings from phase 2 as myeg needs to first make cstm a success over the next few months. myegs long

cap its share price performance. on a positive note, the groups foreign shareholding is at the lowest level since july 2009, indicating receding risk of stock overhang, due to selldown by foreign

quality of cimb niaga. cimb niaga had reported an annualised credit cost of 75bps for 9mfy13  11bps higher, compared with 6mfy13. management guided that full-year credit cost may increase to between 80bps and 100bps, due to potential deterioration in asset quality, arising from the persistently challenging operating environment in indonesia, where the banks gross impaired loan ratio has crept up to 2.8% in 3qfy13, and the prudence stance taken by management to clean up its loan portfolio and strengthen its loan loss coverage.  mah sing group bhdfair value: rm3.80 buy amresearch (dec 10):

36-hole bukit jawi golf resort) for rm43 million. it intends to develop the land  known as southbay east  into a landed township, with clubhouse facilities. the project is set to be launched in 1h15, with an estimated gross development value (gdv) of rm400 million. we expect the project to be well-received. its price point is suitably positioned to tap the upgraders market. we estimate southbay east to boost the groups new landbank gdv to rm9 billion ytd, and total gdv to rm29 billion (2,755 acres). we maintain our forecast for now, pending completion of the land deal. unbilled sales remain healthy at rm4.2 billion. the southbay east project underscores mah sings strategic move to buy more land for township projects, at affordable price-points, amid rising land prices and the governments

restricted offer for sale, for ioi properties. hold ioi corp for the ioi prop entitlement, as there is substantial value in the latter. but post ex-date, ioi corps share price could be under pressure, as it trades at an implied 25 times forward per, on its demerged plantation earnings. maintain earnings forecasts and unchanged target price of rm5.42, on 19 times 2014 per. we believe any potential weakness in ioi corps share price, should be compensated by the capital appreciation of ioi prop shares, which will be listed at an estimated market listing reference price of rm8.25 billion. applying a 20% discount to independent valuers rm18 billion market value for ioi prop, there is a high probability that ioi prop could re-rate to above rm12 billion, within the next 12 months (+45%). at rm12

our buy call on bauto, with a higher fair value of rm2.30 (from rm2.10 previously), following sterling interim results. bautos 1hfy14 results had strongly outperformed consensus and was ahead of our already-bullish forecast. it reported a 2q14 net profit of rm28 million, which brought its 1h14 earnings to rm54 million, accounting for 142% of consensus estimates and 108% of our projection, if annualised. we raise our fy14f to fy16f earnings by 6% to 8%, to factor in lower effective duty cost for a recently-launched cbu model, due to a favourable change in docket pricing and higher earnings for the 30%-owned mazda malaysia, which strongly outperformed our initial expectation, due to better-than-expected margins and japanese yen rates locked in.  bauto is undervalued at 10 times fy15f earnings, relative to the sector average of 12 times, given its strong earnings trajectory, status as a proxy to the upcoming energy efficient vehicle programme and exposure to the high growth asean auto market.  cocoaland holdings bhdfair value: rm2.23 trading sell kenanga research (dec 10): cocoalands 9m13 net profit, which contracted 16% to rm14.1 million, accounted for only 49% and 68% of our and consensus full-year estimates respectively, despite revenue rising 14% over the year.  this was mainly due to a rm2 million one-off start-up cost for the new gummy production line, higher labour cost arising from the minimum wages at rm3 million per annum, higher freight charges, and poor product mix from the lower margin beverage products. in the absence of these incidents, earnings could have been better, compared with year 2012.  post 9m13 results, we have lowered our fy13 to fy14 net profit forecast by 33% to 35%, to rm18.5 million and rm22.4 million respectively. cocoalands fair value, correspondently, has been cut to rm2.23 (from rm2.76 previously), based on an unchanged targeted fy14 per of 17.1 times, which is in-line with its five-year average. in view of lack of near-term catalysts and limited upside to the fair value, we are now recommending a trading sell on the stock (from trading buy previously). drb-hicom bhd target price: rm3.33 buy hlib research (dec 10): drb-hicoms recent second quarter results beat market expectations, with strong earnings contribution from the automotive subsidiaries, which is an encouraging sign for the potential turnaround of wholly-owned proton and lotus.  besides about rm10 million contribution from armoured wheeled vehicle contracts, we reckon that the strong earnings was attributed to the strong sales volume of proton and controlled losses on lotus.  proton sales jumped after the successful launch of saga sv, priced at rm33,400. we understand that the low pricing was due to successful cost cutting and efficiency improvement measures. they recently launched persona sv (starting from rm44,900), and theres an upcoming global small car model in 1h14.  we remain positive of the groups restructuring efforts, after witnessing the growth in proton sales, improved earnings and the continued disposal of non-core assets, and its recent inclusion in the shariah-compliant list. its a severely undervalued counter. malaysian resources corp bhdfair value: rm1.32 neutral  rhb research (dec 10): we downgrade mrcb from a trading buy, cut our fy13 numbers to a loss from a profit, and lower our fy14 forecast by 76%, as we believe it will have to overcome several company-specific issues and headwinds in the property sector, before it can capitalise on its enlarged size and scale for growth, post-merger with the gapurna group. we believe mrcb has been hit by a perfect storm, made up of a number of issues that will take time to be addressed, namely: 1) the shocking rm167 million provisions in its latest quarterly results; 2) its recent removal from the shariah-compliant list; 3) the legal tussle with the selangor government, over the acquisition of lot 12 of pj sentral; 4) the long-overdue issue on the eastern dispersal link in johor; 5) delay in implementation of the redevelopment of the rubber research institute land; 6) the impact of overall weakened sentiment, and hence, sales, in the property market, and investors reduced appetite towards property stocks; and 7) investors lack of familiarity with the new management and management style.dayang enterprise holdings bhdtarget price: rm6.02 outperform  publicinvest research (dec 9): dayang has proposed to undertake a one-for-two bonus issue of up to 275 million new ordinary shares. subject to the exercising of the bonus, the share price will be adjusted to rm3.57 (assuming the closing price is rm5.35). the bonus issue will be capitalised from dayangs share premium and retained earnings, and is expected to be completed by 1q14. with ongoing contribution from topside maintenance services, coupled with higher fleet utilisation, we believe the group is in a healthy balance sheet position, to undertake the exercise. as for expansion strategies, it acquired an offshore accommodation workboat, which is expected to be delivered by 4q, as part of the fleet expansion plan to provide marine support offshore oil and gas (o&g) facilities. it strengthened its presence in the o&g sector, by sustaining a strong asset base of nine marine vessels. it also chartered marine vessels from its 26%-owned perdana petroleum, for the pan

assumption of not more than rm30 million liabilities). ske owns 26,794ha of plantation land in kalabakan in sabah, of which 2,979ha has been planted. the deal is expected to be completed by 2q14. assuming an enterprise value per ha of rm50,000 for the immature planted area, the remaining 23,800ha of greenfield land would be worth rm6,300/ha. this seems fair, given that the land is hilly, which is less favourable than flat/undulating terrain for plantation estates. tshs net gearing will rise to 0.7 times, upon completion of the deal  below managements target cap of 0.8 times. the access to greenfield land in sabah could accelerate tshs planting programme, given the more stable regulatory framework in malaysia. we nudged up our target price by 40 sen, after incorporating the acquisition of ske. we continue to like tsh for its strong growth prospect. land & general bhd target price: 65 sen trading buy  hwangdbs vickers research (dec 10): l&gs earnings are on a strong upward trajectory, underpinned by about rm800 million unbilled sales for [emailprotected] and damansara foresta phase 1, which will be completed in the second quarter of 2014 and final quarter of 2015, respectively.  this works out to four times fy13 property development revenue, translating into a rm200 million profit, to be recognised over the next three years. in 2014, l&g is planning to launch rm1.5 billion worth of residential projects. we expect take-up to remain relatively resilient for prime location and landed properties.  it trades at a discount, in part likely due to scepticism over some related-party transactions. since tan sri david chiu took over the helm, there have been four major rpts with his affiliated mayland and hong kong-listed far east group. however, its 70% discount to rnav and five times fy15 fully diluted per, seem too steep compared to 48% and nine times current average for small-mid cap property developers, respectively. sapurakencana petroleum bhd target

also the progress for the berantai rsc, we believe that full-year earnings are achievable.  high activity levels are expected to be sustained, especially in the fabrication and hook-up commissioning (huc) segment, as more projects come on-stream. the offshore construction and sub-sea service (ocss) segment, will continue to see encouraging performance. its order book remains strong, at us$7.6

from the fabrication and huc segment. tender book value is almost similar to the current order book.  although potential upside is now less than 15%, we maintain our buy call, as there is a

ventures sdn bhd (arv), hold a 60% stake in the jv company while gshs will hold the remaining 40%.  astros initial capital investment is expected to be around rm42 million. according to management, the home shopping business will be implemented using two dedicated channels  one malay and the second chinese. the first channel is expected to start operations in the second half of 2014.  management believes that the home shopping business offers a good opportunity to leverage its platform of 3.8 million pay tv subscribers. we are positive on the new development as it gives astro a potential new stream of revenue as well as exposure to the malaysian retail market. moreover, we do not expect astro to make significant capital investments as it already has a nationwide broadcasting network. also, its existing production facilities and talents can be easily redeployed to produce home shopping programming content.  in terms of contribution, the new segment should add another 3% to 4% to

sharply and went as low as 1,769.80 before closing at 1,778.83 points the day the market reopened after the holidays. the index did fall to the 1,780 to 1,790-point support level that i envisaged in my previous commentary. the market eventually rebounded last wednesday and continued the momemtum until it closed at 1,821 points yesterday. this confirms the support level. the question now is whether the index can maintain its bullish rally. the klci rose 2.5% in a week to 1,824.17 points after trading in a range of between 1,782.82 and 1,824.20 points. the close near the high of the trading range indicates good bullish momentum. average trading volume in the past one week was higher at 1.8 billion shares, compared with 1.3 billion shares two weeks ago. last week, net sellers on bursa malaysia were foreign institutions at rm1,067.6 million and local retail at only 4.4 million shares. local institutions were the main buyers. in the klci, gainers beat decliners 9 to 1. the gainers were led by digi.com bhd (10.3%), cimb group holdings bhd (5.6%) and felda global ventures holdings bhd (+5.4%), while decliners were led by ioi properties group bhd (-1.5%), hong leong bank bhd (-0.6%) and petronas dagangan bhd (-0.1%). global markets rebounded in the middle of last week and that prevented a bigger loss. markets were boosted after debt rating agency moodys said that the united states aaa rating would not likely be affected by the country hitting its borrowing ceiling this week, as well as the improving us job growth data. in the region, singapores straits times index

as the us dollar weakened against major currencies. the us dollar index fell from 81.11 points a week ago to 80.73 points. despite the weaker dollar, the ringgit weakened against the greenback from rm3.31 to rm3.34. wti crude oil futures increased 3.4% in a week at us$100.00 (rm334.00) per barrel. comex gold futures increased 1.4% in a week to us$1,274.70 an ounce. crude palm oil rebounded last week. crude palm oil futures rose 3.3% in a week to rm2,611 per tonne after its end-january inventory fell 2.6% from the previous month. the klci was supported by the 200-day moving average and rebounded from this level last week. yesterday, the index managed to climb above the short-term 30-day moving average at 1,820 points which could indicate an end to the bearish trend since early this year. however, the index is still below the ichimoku cloud indicator, indicating that the trend may still be bearish. momentum indicators like the rsi rebounded last week and crossed above its middle levels. this simply indicates that the weak bearish momentum has turned bullish. furthermore, the macd indicator has also crossed above its trigger line or nine-day moving average. the klci has rebounded and closed above the mid-band of the bollinger bands indicator indicating that the bullish momentum is strengthening. all these indicators show that the klci has potential to climb higher. this week will be a crucial week to see if the market will continue to be supported. the support is likely going to come from local institutions as the foreign institution selling trend is still apparent. the klci support level will be at 1,800 points and the market may continue to stay bullish as long as it stays above this level.now that the index has broken above the immediate resistance level at 1,820 points, the bullish momentum may continue with the index testing the next resistance level at 1,840 points, which is a 61.8% fibonacci retracement level from the downtrend since the

crisis in thailand, say economists. investors contemplating using thailand as a production base may reconsider (doing so), ram holdings bhds group chief economist dr yeah kim leng told the edge financial daily. instead of expanding further there, the instability provides justification for them to seek alternative locations, at least to diversify their regional operations. malaysia would be the obvious choice, given our location, infrastructure, english-speaking workforce and attractive policy environment. cimb investment bank bhd chief economist lee heng guie concurs. there will be little negative spillover effects on malaysia in the near term. our trade with thailand is not significant. in the longer term, we may in fact see investment flows redirected to malaysia. as an investor, you do not want to put all your eggs in one basket. we believe that the crisis will be prolonged and there will also be lingering uncertainty. we have cut our gross domestic product forecast for thailand this year by one percentage point to 2.8%, said lee. tensions have escalated in thailand between government and opposition supporters following an attempt three months ago by prime minister yingluck shinawatras government to force through a bill granting amnesty to her brother, thaksin shinawatra, an ex-prime minister convicted of corruption and abuse of power. the thai government declared a state of emergency on jan 22 following outbreaks of violence. foreign newswires reported that voting on sunday was disrupted in 69 (or 18%) of the 375 constituencies nationwide. the results of the poll, which the main opposition democrat party boycotted, will not be announced until by-elections are held in dozens of districts where protesters blocked candidates from registering. in the meantime, yingluck will remain caretaker prime minister with no policy authority. rams yeah pointed out that the current political crisis has not yet significantly affected production in thailand and is limited to its capital city. investors are also still waiting to see how the situation develops before making decisions. nonetheless, the cumulative effect of all the inconveniences of recent years is making thailand less attractive, especially for investors looking to build a regional hub or headquarters. malaysia seems more attractive now, he said. yeah believes that the automotive sector, thailands third-largest industry, would be the worst afflicted. dynamics friendlier to malaysia could therefore be playing in the region as malaysia seeks to catch up on the fdi it has been losing out to thailand since the 1990s. hondas recent doubling of its plant capacity in malaysia was an effort to diversify away from thailand, say analysts. toyotas thai subsidiary said recently it might rethink its planned investment of up to 20 billion baht (rm2.03 billion  and perhaps even scale down production  if the unrest persists. when asked how the previous bouts of protests in thailand have affected french investments into malaysia, fabrice godeau, vice-president of malaysian french chamber of commerce and industry, said: malaysia is known now to be one of the key business hubs in the asean region and it benefits from its stable political and financial environment favourable to the world of entrepreneurs. bangkok has undergone a succession of major events disruptive to business, including a coup du00e9tat in 2006, political unrest since 2008, and floods in 2011. thailand, nonetheless, has managed to attract growing inflows of fdi, especially in the automotive sector. as at 2012, the stock of inward fdi in thailand stood at us$159.1 billion (rm531.4 billion), versus malaysias us$132.4 billion.  however, the unrest in thailand could have negative consequences on malaysia too. thailand is an important country to the asean economic community (aec), which is intended to be an alternative to china, india and other large markets, said yeah. unrest may dampen the aecs attraction as a market base. it will not derail malaysias growth prospects, but it will be negative for the region to have a member country in trouble. malaysian-thai chamber of commerce chairman yeap swee chuan said any disturbance affecting a neighbour would affect ones home too. for example, tourists tend to visit singapore, malaysia, and thailand in one trip. unrest in thailand will discourage some from visiting the region altogether. safe neighbours and easy access across borders would be beneficial to malaysias economy, he told the edge financial daily. yeap does not expect the impact of the protests on business sentiment in thailand to be significant or lasting. we have gone through such disturbances in thailand so many times, but whenever thailand goes down 10%, it always bounces back by 12%. such is thailand. it is a unique country. there may be some impact on investors who are not in thailand, since they would be influenced by what they read in the papers. as they are not on the ground, they do not know what the situation really is like. only businesses in certain areas are affected and even so, not the whole time.  the demonstrations are largely peaceful. what is emergency rule in thailand compared with other countries? there is no emergency feeling. you can still go out at night, and still have gatherings of thousands of people, he said. yeap said most companies that have already been in the country for a long time, such as carmakers, would only hold off their new investments until calm returns. in the past, people held off

stands to attract more foreign direct investment (fdi) as a result of the political crisis in thailand, say economists. investors contemplating using thailand as a production base may reconsider (doing so), ram holdings bhds group chief economist dr yeah kim leng told the edge financial daily. instead of expanding further there, the instability provides justification for them to seek alternative locations, at least to diversify their regional operations. malaysia would be the obvious choice, given our location, infrastructure, english-speaking workforce and attractive policy environment. cimb investment bank bhd chief economist lee heng guie concurs. there will be little negative spillover effects on malaysia in the near term. our trade with thailand is not significant. in the longer term, we may in fact see investment flows redirected to malaysia. as an investor, you do not want to put all your eggs in one basket. we believe that the crisis will be prolonged and there will also be lingering uncertainty. we have cut our gross domestic product forecast for thailand this year by one percentage point to 2.8%, said lee. tensions have escalated in thailand between government and opposition supporters following an attempt three months ago by prime minister yingluck shinawatras government to force through a bill granting amnesty to her brother, thaksin shinawatra, an ex-prime minister convicted of corruption and abuse of power. the thai government declared a state of emergency on jan 22 following outbreaks of violence. foreign newswires reported that voting on sunday was disrupted in 69 (or 18%) of the 375 constituencies nationwide. the results of the poll, which the main opposition democrat party boycotted, will not be announced until by-elections are held in dozens of districts where protesters blocked candidates from registering. in the meantime, yingluck will remain caretaker prime minister with no policy authority. rams yeah pointed out that the current political crisis has not yet significantly affected production in thailand and is limited to its capital city. investors are also still waiting to see how the situation develops before making decisions. nonetheless, the cumulative effect of all the inconveniences of recent years is making thailand less attractive, especially for investors looking to build a regional hub or headquarters. malaysia seems more attractive now, he said. yeah believes that the automotive sector, thailands third-largest industry, would be the worst afflicted. dynamics friendlier to malaysia could therefore be playing in the region as malaysia seeks to catch up on the fdi it has been losing out to thailand since the 1990s. hondas recent doubling of its plant capacity in malaysia was an effort to diversify away from thailand, say analysts. toyotas thai subsidiary said recently it might rethink its planned investment of up to 20 billion baht (rm2.03 billion  and perhaps even scale down production  if the unrest persists. when asked how the previous bouts of protests in thailand have affected french investments into malaysia, fabrice godeau, vice-president of malaysian french chamber of commerce and industry, said: malaysia is known now to be one of the key business hubs in the asean region and it benefits from its stable political and financial environment favourable to the world of entrepreneurs. bangkok has undergone a succession of major events disruptive to business, including a coup du00e9tat in 2006, political unrest since 2008, and floods in 2011. thailand, nonetheless, has managed to attract growing inflows of fdi, especially in the automotive sector. as at 2012, the stock of inward fdi in thailand stood at us$159.1 billion (rm531.4 billion), versus malaysias us$132.4 billion.  however, the unrest in thailand could have negative consequences on malaysia too. thailand is an important country to the asean economic community (aec), which is intended to be an alternative to china, india and other large markets, said yeah. unrest may dampen the aecs attraction as a market base. it will not derail malaysias growth prospects, but it will be negative for the region to have a member country in trouble. malaysian-thai chamber of commerce chairman yeap swee chuan said any disturbance affecting a neighbour would affect ones home too. for example, tourists tend to visit singapore, malaysia, and thailand in one trip. unrest in thailand will discourage some from visiting the region altogether. safe neighbours and easy access across borders would be beneficial to malaysias economy, he told the edge financial daily. yeap does not expect the impact of the protests on business sentiment in thailand to be significant or lasting. we have gone through such disturbances in thailand so many times, but whenever thailand goes down 10%, it always bounces back by 12%. such is thailand. it is a unique country. there may be some impact on investors who are not in thailand, since they would be influenced by what they read in the papers. as they are not on the ground, they do not know what the situation really is like. only businesses in certain areas are affected and even so, not the whole time.  the demonstrations are largely peaceful. what is emergency rule in thailand compared with other countries? there is no emergency feeling. you can still go out at night, and still have gatherings of thousands of people, he said. yeap said most companies that have already been in the country for a long time, such as carmakers, would only hold off their new investments until calm returns. in the past, people held off decisions, but once everything [turmoil] is over, they start investing here again. there are advantages to thailand, such as its location and stability. stability is, above all, harmony among the people. in this sense, thailand, with its one racial identity, one religion and one culture, is a harmonious country.

sen. in terms of valuation, tih may appear expensive to some. but analysts who track the stock believe the companys position as a niche player justifies the price tag. cimb research has an add call on the company with a target price of rm2.55, while rhb research has a buy call and a target price of rm2.40. although on the high side, i think tihs valuation is reasonable because it is unique and you cant find this kind of player on the market, says an analyst with a local bank-backed research house. it is a niche player in the travel insurance space, which means it could see strong growth and margins, the analyst adds, noting that the companys share price had come off its high of rm2.17 at end-may 2013. tih is the exclusive insurance provider for airasias insure travel protection plan, which is integrated with the low-cost airlines online ticket purchasing process. tih is also the insurance manager of tune hotels and airasia expedia. hence, tih is considered a close proxy for the passenger volume of airasia and airasia x. in fact, one of tihs key objectives is to grow at least as fast as airasia, says its chief executive peter miller. airasia has always grown at about 20% per year so for the online business, our baseline objective is to grow at least as fast as airasia, he tells the edge. to drive earnings growth, he says the companys strategy is not to increase the travel insurance premiums, but to improve its take-up rates, meaning it aims to have more airasia passengers buying travel insurance from it. when we set our target to grow by, for instance, 20%, we dont allow ourselves to do that by growing premiums. we would see that as sort of cheating to achieve the target, he explains. miller believes that based on tihs and airasias results for the first nine months of 2013, the former has already met its growth target. for the nine months ended sept 30, 2013, tih issued 5.74 million policies, a 32.9% rise from the previous years 4.32 million policies issued.while he declined to give growth estimates for 2014, miller says tih plans to boost its take-up rate by enhancing consumer education, increasing advertising expenditure, supporting its online and offline channels, and conducting product enhancement, among other things. i am more conservative than tih regarding its take-up rate growth prospects, says the analyst. i expect its take-up rate to be relatively stable because it is hard to grow even by educating consumers. currently, the take-up rate is estimated to be in the range of 27% to 35%. meanwhile, tihs management has guided for a take-up rate of 50%. tih has an edge over its competitors because of the convenience of purchasing policies online when one buys a flight ticket. but its insurance is not cheaper compared with that of its competitors, and airasia passengers do have the option to buy other insurance policies through alternative channels, the analyst says.  however, if airasia is able to increase its passenger base, that would help tih grow its take-up rate, he adds. another avenue for growth, which tih is targeting, is to tie up with more airlines to sell its insurance. we have our expertise, particularly in the online distribution of travel insurance with airline partners. so we signed up cebu pacific via malayan insurance co in june 2013 and were aiming to add more good-sized airlines to our portfolio, says miller. we are in discussion with several airlines and we are quite optimistic that we will sign at least one more airline during the course of the year. regional expansion not smooth sailing tih recently faced some hurdles in its effort to acquire insurance businesses in the region. on dec 31, 2013, it terminated a conditional sales and purchase agreement to buy a 70% stake in indonesian insurance company pt batavia mitratama insurance. it became apparent that we were not going to get the approval anytime soon, says miller, adding that tih decided to focus on the other contingency options available. the company aims to acquire insurance licences in the region that will enable it to expand its business into the non-travel insurance segments and reduce its reliance on airasia. the termination of the agreement with batavia came as a surprise to analysts who say it would have been a good deal for earnings enhancement. miller says one of tihs key objectives is to grow at least as fast as airasia why terminate an agreement while waiting for the regulators approval? there is no harm in waiting. now it seems that it will have to take a longer route, says an analyst with a local research house. miller says, we remain confident of owning insurance companies in indonesia and thailand  effectively by the end of 2014 and aim for this to be sooner rather than later. tih is eyeing small and profitable businesses that it can integrate easily with the group. these purchases are also expected to be relatively cheap with price tags of around us$10 million (rm32.7 million). at this juncture, we do not anticipate needing to borrow to fund our acquisitions, but this option is, of course, readily available, says miller. tih has rm14.48 million cash as at sept 30, 2013. if its fixed deposits of less than three months are included, tih has rm200 million in cash, according to miller. but realistically, we have circa rm100 million we can use for such acquisitions as well as paying for any proposed dividends as per the dividend policy, he adds. tih has set a minimum dividend policy of 40%, which miller is optimistic of attaining. for its third quarter ended september

against major currencies last week. the us dollar index increased from 80.61 points to 81.28 points last monday. this caused the ringgit to weaken against the greenback. the ringgit weakened from rm3.26 against a us dollar a week ago to rm3.32. gold prices, which were trending upwards since late december last year, started to feel some pressure this week as the greenback strengthens. commodity

weeks. crude palm oil rose 3.8% in a week to rm2,588 per tonne on a weaker ringgit. technically, the klci is in a correction of an uptrend. the index rebounded exactly on the uptrend line on monday, indicating that there is still support for the uptrend. however, the index is below the short-term 30-day moving average and is currently in the ichimoku cloud. these indicators show there is a possibility of further downward correction, unless the klci does not test the low on monday again, which is the uptrend support level. the klci should remain bullish as long as it stays above the uptrend support line. momentum indicators have started to turn bearish. the rsi indicator continued to decline below the mid-level and the macd indicator fell below its mid-level. furthermore, the bollinger bands are expanding with the klci trading near the bottom band. these indicators show that the downtrend momentum may continue if the index does not rebound from current levels and break above the immediate resistance level. the immediate resistance level to break to bring back positive market sentiment is at 1,835 points. technically, the market sentiment may continue to weaken because of the bearish momentum. furthermore, the weakening ringgit is a turn-off for the local market. however, the klci is currently oversold in the short term and is at the support level of the uptrend and therefore a rebound is expected. furthermore, rebounds in the regional market may boost market sentiment. the rebound may only be confirmed if the index is able to break above the immediate resistance level at 1,835 points. henceforth, i expect to see the klci trying to test this level this week and failure to do so would cause the index to remain bearish. benny lee is chief

will spend around rm380 million in 2014 to acquire several new assets.  axis-reit chief executive officer, datuk stewart labrooy, said the assets to be acquired include six industrial buildings in johor; an industrial facility in prai, penang; two logistics warehouses in shah alam; an office industrial building in petaling jaya; and a distribution centre (dc) facility in port klang.  it was prudent to let the markets stabilise and asset pricing to return to normality. we are now back in the acquisition market this year as yield compressions have come off quite a bit, labrooy said at a media briefing on axis-reits performance for 2013 yesterday. axis-reit, which currently has 31 properties under its portfolio, decided not to acquire assets last year due to massive compression in reit yields across the board as share prices increased. this created a distortion in asset prices as they rose sharply in anticipation of continued low yield and interest rate environment. labrooy said the companys new asset acquisitions will be funded by a combination of share placement in the equity market and internal funds. since it was listed in 2005, the company has undertaken four rounds of equity placements, raising a total of rm487.4 million.  as at dec 31, 2013, axis-reit has cash and cash equivalents of rm34.8 million.  for the 2013 financial year (fy13), axis-reit recorded a total trust revenue of rm141.98 million, a 6.8% increase from rm132.97 million recorded in fy12. realised gross revenue of rm141.3 million was contributed by rental income of rm133 million and car park income of rm5.57 million. profit for the full year rose to rm111.28 million against rm103.12 million fy12. the group announced an 18.5% dividend per unit for fy13, an increase from 17.3 sen distributed in 2012. for the fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2013, axis-reit recorded a total trust revenue of rm36.19 million and realised income before taxation of rm21.45 million. in fy13, the company sold axis plaza to a subsidiary of singapore post for rm34 million. this resulted in a gain of rm10.94 million, which will only be realised in april this year. axis-reit said portfolio occupancy was at 94.87% in 2013, despite axis business campus being vacated for enhancement. occupancy rates have been noted to range from 92.27% to 97.22% in the past five years. hwang dbs vickers has a buy call

for the kraken field in the north sea. the award was expected to be signed before nov 30, 2013. first oil is expected to be produced by 2016 or 2017.  we maintain our earnings forecast at this juncture, as we have incorporated potential earnings from this new contract. we estimate this contract to be worth around us$1 billion (rm3.18 billion).  we maintain our buy recommendation, premised on: (i) expanding top line; (ii) increasing order book quality value, with sizeable extension options; (iii) sustainable margins of more than 20%; and (iv) an undemanding valuation. we value bumi armada at rm4.83 per share, derived from forward per for fy14 of 21 times, and fy14 eps of 23 sen. at this juncture, it trades at a forward per of 16.5 times. this is below its average per of 26 times, since its listing in 2011. umw oil & gas corp bhdtarget price: rm3.16 neutral alliance research (nov 19): umw oil & gas reported 3qfy13 and 9mfy13 core net profits of rm51 million and rm102.2 million, respectively. its 9mfy13 core net profit made up 78.5% of our estimate, and 59.8% of consensus estimate. core net profit was adjusted for a rm30.4 million gain on property disposal.  its 9mfy13 results made up slightly more than 75% of full-year estimate, as naga 2 had got a higher time charter rate for a spot charter in vietnam. compared with consensus, we view that the results could be lower, because consensus numbers might be distorted by the property gain.  we raise our fy13 net profit by 4.4%, to reflect the higher-than-expected time charter rate for naga 2. we also raise our estimated daily charter rate of us$150,000 (rm477,000) per day, to us$200,000, for this six-month spot charter. we maintain our target price of rm3.16. this is based on fy15 eps of 15.8 sen, pegging an industry peak cycle average per of 20 times. tsh resources bhdtarget price: rm3 buy maybank investment bank (nov 20): tshs 3qfy13 net profit was boosted by gains from the disposal of pontian united plantations shares (rm85 million), which partially offset foreign exchange losses (rm44 million). stripping one-offs, 3qfy13 core net profit of rm31.6 million (up 46% q-o-q and 110% y-o-y) took 9mfy13 net profit to rm73 million (up 50% y-o-y), accounting for 85% of our estimate and 82% of consensus estimate. with the strongest fresh fruit bunch (ffb) output growth among peers, vast unplanted land and improving gearing position, tshs stock is due for a rerating. as we raise our earnings forecasts and target fy14 per to 19 times, from 17 times, tsh is a buy, with a higher target price of rm3 (up 10%). since we expect output to peak in 4qfy13, tshs 9mfy13 production (up 34% y-o-y), which accounted for 74% of our fy13 estimate, has surpassed our forecast. the strong production growth is driven by its young and fertile oil palm estates in kalimantan. we raise our fy13 and fy14 production forecasts by 6% and 5%, respectively. lafarge malaysia bhdtarget price: rm9.85 fully valued hwangdbs vickers research (nov 20): lafarges 3qfy13 net profit of rm120 million, was 25% higher y-o-y (up 48% q-o-q). its operating margins rose 21.5%, compared with 3qfy12s 18.7% and 2qfy13s 14.6%. this was mainly due to improved plant performance and fewer maintenance shutdowns, during the period. higher domestic demand from infrastructure projects and lower coal prices (down 14% y-o-y and 10% q-o-q) may have also played a part in the higher margins. this brought 9mfy13 earnings to 76% of our estimate, and 74% of consensus full-year estimate. we think the near-term outlook for the cement industry will be challenging, in view of the governments move to cut back on its major infrastructure projects and slower property construction activity, post-budget 2014.  while lafarges specialised cement solutions should mitigate the volatile rebates on ordinary portland cement, we believe that overall macro concerns do not justify the stocks premium valuations and low dividend yield. our price target is pegged at 17 times fy14f eps. cimb group holdings bhdtarget price: rm8.40 buy ta securities (nov 19): results are broadly within expectations, accounting for 73% of our estimate and consensus full-year estimate. annualised return on equity stood at 16%, which is within managements target.  net profit rose 7.3% y-o-y, underpinned by stronger contributions from consumer and corporate banking. meanwhile, contributions from investment banking and treasury and markets, contracted.  net interest income (nii) advanced 7.3% (up 1.6% q-o-q), on stronger loans growth of 14.2%. in local currency terms, singapore and thailand led, with a 41.8% and 28.7% y-o-y increase. nevertheless, nii was muted by weaker net interest margin, which fell 21 bps y-o-y. non-nii saw losses arising from financial assets held for trading, amounting to rm143.6 million versus gains of rm66.7 million, in 9mfy12.  we maintain our target price at rm8.40, which translates into an implied forward fy14 price-by-volume value of 2 times  slightly above the industrys average fy13 price-to-book value of 1.8 times. we maintain our buy recommendation.  this story first appeared in the edge weekly edition

which finalised the us$1.4 billion (rm4.62 billion) kraken deal in the north sea just last month. the outcome of the bid in angola is expected to be known by the end of the first quarter at the

of the contract has not been disclosed, but we understand that it could be about the same size as the kraken contract, double the average value of an fpso contract in asia. bumi armada is now actively bidding for around 12 fpso contracts, including jobs in mexico and west nigeria  expected to be awarded closer to the year end. we have imputed in our forecasts two new fpso contracts for this year. bumi armadas order book is now at a record rm13.7 billion, driven by the fpso segment (73%), followed by transport and installation (14%) and offshore support vessels (osv, 13%). its extension options are worth rm9.1 billion, also a new high, with contributions from fpsos (68%) and osvs (32%). accumulate the stock and ride the contributions from bumi armadas expanding fpso fleet. furthermore,

lumpur: cimb group holdings bhds shares took a beating yesterday after it announced a rm3.5 billion capital raising exercise on monday. profit-taking activities on the local bourse dampened sentiment, affecting many index-linked counters including cimb group. at the close of trading yesterday, cimb shares were down 21 sen or 2.88%, with 20.32 million shares done  making the banking group bursa malaysias 11th biggest decliner. the intraday low was rm6.95. in early trading yesterday, the stock dropped nearly 5% before recovering in the afternoon, trading slightly above the issue price of rm7.10. cimb had announced the rm3.55 billion capital raising exercise via a private placement of 500 million new shares, or 6.08% of its enlarged share capital, at rm7.10 apiece. the rationale was to reposition its capital for growth, following a sharp depreciation in the indonesian rupiah. the new issue lifts cimb groups common equity tier 1 (cet1) as at sept 30, 2013 from 8.2% to approximately 9.7%. the new equity was placed to domestic and foreign investors over the course of the working day last monday. the offer was well oversubscribed and enabled cimb group to increase the deal size by 25% from 400 million to 500 million shares. analysts had mixed reactions to cimb groups share placement, due to the dilutive effect the exercise will have on the groups equity and earnings despite boosting capital ratios. kaf investment research estimates that the placement will have a dilutive impact of up to 100 basis points on cimb groups return on equity (roe). the core equity ratio of the cimb group was 7.64% and tier-1 capital adequacy ratio (car) was 9.16%, relatively low amongst malaysian banks and probably explain the rationale for raising extra capital, said kaf in a note yesterday. assuming a 4.5% yield on the funds raised, we estimate there is a 3% earnings per share (eps) dilution from the private placement. the impact on roe is larger at about a 100 basis points

maintaining its buy call on cimb group, but has cut its target price to rm8.40 from rm9.10 previously. the research house said the knee-jerk selling after the placement would be a good buying opportunity for investors. uob kayhian research believes cimb is highly likely to miss its internal target of achieving a group common equity tier-1 (cet1) of 9.5% by 2015, dragged by slower growth in its indonesian operation. it projects a negative dilution impact on 2014f eps of 6% and expects 2014f roe to possibly moderate from the estimate of 15.1% to 14.1%. given the intensifying growth headwinds in indonesia, and hence potential earnings downgrades coupled with the dilution effect from the recent capital-raising exercise, we believe that sentiment on the stock is likely to remain poor, the research house said in a note. the capital-raising exercise may have come as a slight surprise to the market given the fact that the company alluded that it viewed its 8.2% group cet1 ratio as optimal. it had sufficient time to build additional capital buffers in light of its dividend reinvestment plan, and full implementation of basel iii would only kick in by 2019. uob kayhian is maintaining its hold position on cimb group and lowering its target price to rm7.51 from rm7.80, after incorporating the dilution. this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on january

were a few positive surprises from prestariangs presentations, which include its seriousness in scaling up its oil and gas (o&g) training business as its existing school is already operating at full capacity. it is looking to set up a new o&g training school in johor, probably sometime this year.  the company said it also expected strong revenue contribution from its autodesk software in the fourth quarter (4q) of 2013 as it had finalised new distribution terms with autodesk in 3q13. prestariang is now the master distributor for autodesk software for the education and o&g sector. the company is also looking at acquiring regional businesses which have synergies with its current core business. it has already hired a consultant to search for opportunities in the region. we are

wednesday night. the sp500 lost 0.27 points to close at 1,837.61 points whilst the dow fell 68.2 points to end at 16,462.74. the fbm klci traded in a sideways range of 15.4 points for the week with volumes of 1.6 billion to 1.96 billion shares done. the index closed at 1,828.21 yesterday, down 3.09 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like ioi corp bhd, sime darby bhd, axiata group bhd, cimb bank bhd and tenaga nasional bhd caused the index to decline on profit taking activities yesterday. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the index price movements in the next few months following may 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low) and 1,882.2 (high). the indexs daily signals are mixed. the cci and macd are negative while the dmi, oscillator and stochastic are positive. as such, the indexs obvious support levels are seen at the 1,780, 1,800 and 1,822 levels, whilst the resistance areas of 1,828, 1,849 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some heavy profit-taking activities. our upside targets of 1,898, 1,900 and 1,924 for the index in the medium term may be deferred for now. its simple moving averages (ma) depict a double time frame (weekly and monthly) uptrend for now. its daily chart has turned into a neutral position in january 2014. due to its mixed signals, we believe investors may adopt a range trading philosophy as the klci remains at fairly lofty levels with bearish divergent signals. as such, profit-taking on index components as well as small to mid caps may persist into the next fortnight. despite the lofty tone of the klci, we are recommending a chart buy on mkh bhd, which is a rm1.1 billion market cap company with a return on equity of 12% based on its 12-month trailing earnings. the stock made a new recent high of rm3.27 in tandem with the improving sentiment of the small and mid cap property stocks. it seems that the recent recurring theme from the property segment is the asset revaluation approach, where investors favour property companies with strategic landbank with development potential.  the firm rise in the stock price can be attributed to investors optimism on its strong earnings trend led by the plantation and property and construction division. for the fourth quarter of financial year 2013 ended sept 30, mkhs group revenue rose 21%. the rise was attributed to its plantation divisions higher sales of crude palm oil and palm kernel, as well as the property and construction divisions revenue from ongoing and new developments. despite the better profitability, profit before tax was lower due to an inclusion of foreign exchange losses in the current quarter totalling rm63 million due to a weakening rupiah and ringgit against the us dollar. maybank-ib does not have fundamental coverage on mkh. a check on bloomberg consensus revealed that three brokers have coverage on the stock, with all having a buy call on the stock.  the stock is currently trading at a reasonable historical price-earnings ratio of 10 times and a price-to-book value of 1.2 times. mkhs indicated dividend yield is at 3.14%. its chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly timeframes are very strong indeed. its share price made an obvious surge since its monthly wave-2 low of 57 sen in october 2008. since that 57 sen low, mkh surged to its recent january 2014 high of rm3.27.  its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to the recent high of rm3.27. as it broke above its recent key critical resistances of rm2.62 and rm2.85, look to buy mkh on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to long term uptrends for this stock.  the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) are very strong and now depict the obvious indications of mkhs eventual surge to higher levels. we expect mkh to remain very firm towards its support levels of rm2.62, rm2.85 and rm3.10.  it will attract minor profit taking at the resistance levels of rm3.27, rm3.58 and rm4.13. its upside targets are now located at rm3.45, rm3.76, rm4.09 and rm4.22. this

despite concern over increased competition for the pan malaysian installation contract, sapurakencana petroleum (sakp) has reportedly emerged as a front runner for the deepwater and heavy-lift packages.  the other contender for these packages is singapores swiber offshore. however, sakp is said to have the edge over swiber, given petronas local preference policy. these contracts have already been factored into our estimates, as sakp has been the key contractor for malaysian installation work since 2008. based on the rates indicated by petronas, we estimate packages c, d and e can be worth rm3 billion to rm3.5 billion, assuming a three-year term. this is less than sakps previous contract sum of rm4.5 billion, for four packages awarded in 2008.  despite the smaller contract value, we expect margins to be better this time around, as the groups vessels working on the job will be wholly-owned. we maintain our strong buy call on sakp, with a view to raise earnings estimates.

profit of rm500,000, for the year ended dec 31, 2012.  however, we understand that the low net profit was due to management fees owed to seacera group, which will be reversed under the share sale agreement. on this basis, seacera polyfilms net profit is actually rm2.8 million, implying a per of 14.3 times. we remain positive about scientexs ongoing expansion plans and earnings potential.  maintain target price of rm6.28, based on the blended sop valuation.ytl power international bhdtarget price: rm2.55 outperform cimb research (nov 11): we maintain our outperform call on ytl power, with an unchanged sop-based target price of rm2.55. we believe, the news that ytl power submitted the lowest bid for project 3b, will put the company on investors radar again.  the rerating catalyst will be the announcement of ytl power, securing the contract for project 3b, which is expected to be known by early 2014. assuming ytl power wins the bid, this will provide the group with consistent cash flows from 2018 onwards, and will supplement its current stable businesses. although the dividends can be called into question, given the high capex required for the project, we believe ytl power can ring-fence the construction cost, because of the strong and stable cash flow of the plant. stronger cash flows from the project, will likely translate into bigger dividends in the long term. furthermore, the return of ytl power to the independent power producer scene, implies that there may be more major contracts ahead.guinness anchor bhdtarget price: rm17.50 neutral cimb research (nov 10): guinness anchor bhd (gab) saw its 1qfy14 net profit fall 13% y-o-y, to rm49.6 million. the poor result was due to the drag from the planned reduction in distributor stocks, and weaker consumer spending in anticipation of subsidy cuts and the goods and services tax under budget 2014.  we believe it was also due to less aggressive advertising and promotion (a&p) activities in 1qfy14, as well as pre-budget stockpiling by retailers. we cut our fy14-16 net profit forecasts by 4% to 8%, after lowering our sales expectations by 7%. our dividend discount model-based target price, is reduced correspondingly. although gabs valuation is unattractive, its 4% to 4.5% dividend yield will lend support to its share price.  we think competition will remain intense going forward, as carlsberg has also been investing heavily in a&p, in the past few months. to remain competitive, gab will continue to invest in brand line extension. it will launch several new brands in fy14, especially in the super premium and premium beer categories. petronas chemicals bhdtarget price: rm6.15 hold hwangdbs vickers research (nov 11): following petronas chemicals 3qfy13 results conference call, we understand that the groups olefins and derivatives segment recorded lower plant utilisation of 77.6%, mainly due to heavier-than-usual maintenance at its main cracker and downstream-related facilities. similarly, the fertiliser and methanol segments plant utilisation rate dropped to 62.3%, from 80.3% in 2q13, as a result of unplanned shutdown at its methanol plant, stemming from technical issues related to gas quality and equipment concerns. these issues have since been addressed. the methanol plant will likely remain idle until the end of year 2013, coinciding with the upstream shutdown. to date, project samur has incurred 45% of its capital expenditure, and is on track for commissioning in 2015. the final investment decision for the basf aroma complex, is expected

holdings bhd target price: rm2.70 buy  maybank investment (nov 12): we expect 4qfy13 earnings to be boosted by the seasonally stronger volume from the christmas-related trade and a substantially lower effective tax rate, as the group starts to enjoy tax holiday for the new wharf under container terminal 7. we note that 4qfy12 net profit accounted for 38% of westports full-year fy12 earnings. we recently met up with cma cgm  westports biggest client, to assess the implications of the proposed p3 alliance on westports. the key takeaways are: (i) net volume loss at westports could be only 175,000 teus per annum or 2% of westports total volume, as cma cgm introduces new non-p3 services from 1hfy14 onwards; and (ii) cma cgm will remain committed to hubbing at westports. taking into consideration the p3-related volume loss and growth from the non-p3 business, we project a container throughput growth of 7% (fy13), 6% (fy14) and 8% (fy15). given its dividend payout policy of 75%, we project a net dividend yield of 4.1% for fy14.mah sing group bhd fair value: rm3.80 buy  amresearch (nov 11): we consider the nine months results to be in line, constituting 75% of our full-year

sings future launches will focus on larger township projects offering affordable products, notably landed residential units or apartments with initial price points of below rm500,000.  nestle (m)

of the overall coffee market.  we continue to see vast growth opportunities, driven by nestles product innovation, marketing investments and capacity expansion. including the construction of a new plant, nestle management has guided a capex of rm250 million for fy13e. we estimate net gearing for fy13e will be reduced slightly, from 0.38 times to 0.32 times. construction of the new plant is on

today, cimb has reiterated\nits projections on malaysian crude palm oil (cpo) price will rise by 14%\nto average rm2,700 and rm2,800 for 2014 and 2015 respectively.\nthe rise is due to tighter palm oil supplies and rising biodiesel\ndemand from indonesia and malaysia (driven by higher new mandates). however,\nwe have lowered our rotterdam cpo price slightly, about us$20 per tonne\nfor 2014 and 2015, to reflect slower demand growth from india and\nupgraded our indonesia cpo price forecast by 14-16% for 2014-2015 to\nreflect our house view for a weaker rupiah, said the research house.\napart from higher selling prices, the research house expects\nplantation companies to enjoy higher production growth driven by new\nmature areas and a recovery in fresh fruit bunches (ffb) yields\nfollowing below-par performances in the second quarter (2qfy13) and\nthird quarter of 2013 (3qfy13) or most estates in indonesia.\nwe expect operating costs of estates to be manageable as falling\npotash prices (-20% yoy) are likely to partially offset higher labour\ncosts in indonesia. we project cpo prices to strengthen further\nin 1q14, in view of falling inventories and the lower production season\nfor palm oil from jan-mar. we believe palm oil stocks in malaysia are\nlikely to decline mom in dec due to higher exports.\nthe research house also expects cpo prices to pick up again in late\nfourth quarter this year (4qfy14) as biodiesel initiatives in malaysia\nand indonesia gain momentum. however, prices could soften in\nsecond and third quarter of the year due to rising competition from\nother edible oils and growing palm oil supplies from indonesia and\nmalaysia.\nwe are keeping to our neutral stance on the regional planters as\nthe sector appears to be fairly valued at the current levels as it is\ntrading in line with its historical average sector p/e. this suggests\nthat the market has partially priced the better earnings prospects in\nthe share price of the planters.\nwe expect better 4q13 and fy14 earnings, driven by higher cpo and\npk selling prices, as well as production to offset the rising labour\ncosts. regionally, we prefer the singapore planters due to their\nlarger market capitalisation, liquidity and attractive valuations. as\nsuch, we maintain our overweight weighting on the singapore plantation\nsector. we maintain our neutral stance on the indonesian and malaysian\nplantation sectors, it said.\nfurthermore, cimb anticipates malaysia to post a 2% or 0.3m\ntonnes rise in palm oil output in 2014, driven mainly by better yields\nfrom newly replanted estates and new mature areas in sarawak. we expect the palm oil stock in malaysia to be lower in 1q14 in line with the seasonal weaker production months.\nwe have lowered our fy13 earnings forecasts for malaysian planters\nby 2-10% to reflect the lower malaysian cpo price achieved, it said. the research house added that the target prices for malaysian planters are intact, except for ioi corporation bhd.\nwe downgrade ioi corp's target price to rm4.11 from rm5.96 to\nreflect the recent demerger of its property assets into a separate\ncompany known as ioi properties

services tax (gst), and will be distributed to 300,000 traders nationwide. myeg clarified in a bursa malaysia announcement yesterday that the computer system (mygst) refers to a new system which the customs department is testing to facilitate the implementation of the gst by april 1, 2015.  there are a few parties involved in the various components of this system of which myeg, via its 40%-owned associate company, myeg integrated networks sdn bhd (mint), is one of these parties. as of to date, myeg has not entered into any legally binding agreement with the customs department, it said in the announcement. myeg said that it will announce accordingly should it receive any contract from the customs department. the news report said the system, which costs some rm100 million, includes a back-up should the primary mygst system fail.  a senior analyst from cimb investment bank bhd, nigel foo, said he is confident myeg should be able to secure the contract from the customs department, as the company has been working on this project for the past few years and has successfully completed the pilot project in 2012. if all goes well in the first phase of this project, we believe myeg would extend this service to the other sectors of the economy, likely the retail sector next. the retail sector is much bigger than the entertainment and the f&b sector, which the company is targeting to handle first with the customs department, foo said.  cimb research has a hold call on the stock, based on its report dated nov 30, 2013, with a target price of rm2.78. myeg has reported a net profit of rm8.5 million on the back of rm20.4 million in revenue for its first financial quarter of 2014 ending sept 30, 2013 (1q14). revenue and net profit have increased 27% and 31.1% respectively from the previous years corresponding quarter, which myeg attributed to higher transaction volumes from the online renewal of foreign workers permit, continuous growth in the online renewal of

foreign shareholding (by voting rights) in pbb is limited to a maximum of 30% but this can now be achieved with the electronic trading system. the exercise will be slightly positive for pbb as it will avoid confusion for some investors, especially foreigners, and eliminate the related administrative costs for maintaining two classes of shares. despite pbbs healthy fy14 earnings growth and
