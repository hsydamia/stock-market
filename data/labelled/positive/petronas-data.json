middle eastern markets to expand its fabrication segment, after its fabrication unit was blacklisted by petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) in april 2016. the blacklist excludes its unit, thhe fabricators sdn bhd (tfab), from being a main contractor for petronas major fabrication works. were looking at certain projects in india and the middle east, particularly in qatar, its chief executive officer suhaimi badrul jamil told the edge financial daily recently. its entry into these markets is likely to take the form of a joint venture (jv), he said, whereas thhe would focus on its pivot towards shipbuilding and ship repairs in malaysia in the meantime. for ship repairs, we are in talks for one (project) with a government subsidiary, while another one is commercial, said suhaimi, although he declined to share the value of these projects as discussions are still at a preliminary stage. as for shipbuilding, the company is currently involved in building three offshore patrol vessels (opvs) for the malaysian maritime enforcement agency (mmea) via its jv with destini bhd. thhe owns a 49% stake in the jv company, thhe destini sdn bhd, which had earlier this year received the rm738.9 million opv contract from mmea. building of the ships commenced in mid-december last year at thhes fabrication yard in pulau indah, following a keel-laying ceremony. the same fabrication yard, which stretches 56.79 acres (22.98ha), is thhes only property, according to its 2016 annual report. meanwhile, suhaimi said he is not overly concerned about the group missing out on jobs from petronas, as thhe did not expect any jobs from the national oil firm due to the gap between industry supply for fabrication works and petronas demand. if you look at the high side estimates from petronas, there are only around 10,000 tonnes worth of jobs. comparatively, the capacity of our yard is about 20,000 tonnes, while the capacity of malaysias fabrication industry is about 400,000 tonnes in total, he said. on top of that, most of the jobs offered by petronas are in sarawak and will have to be performed by yards in that state, he said. thats why we are diversifying away from oil and gas to focus more on shipbuilding and ship repairs, said suhaimi, who is also the groups chief financial officer. the move is part of thhes turnaround plans, which has so far seen it receive support from a majority of its creditors for its scheme of arrangement. with the recent approvals from our creditors, were about 70% of the way there in terms of financial restructuring, suhaimi said. on dec 18, the group announced that all of its secured creditors and 94.5% of its unsecured creditors had backed the groups scheme of arrangement at its court convened meeting. two out of three of thhes subsidiaries, namely tfab and o&g works sdn bhd had also received sufficient support from its creditors. however, its 70%-owned thhe offshore services sdn bhd saw 81.33% of unsecured creditors voting against the scheme. suhaimi said the development at thhe offshore wont have any effect on the scheme as the latter is not a major subsidiary. whats important is that we received an overwhelming majority for thhe and tfab, he added. thhe has consistently posted net losses every quarter since the beginning of its 2014 financial year. for the nine months ended sept 30 (9mfy17), the group posted a cumulative net loss of rm70.13 million, significantly lower than the rm171.93 million net loss it posted in the previous year, when it booked a one-off loss on disposal amounting to rm56.3 million. still, revenue for 9mfy17 declined 61.55% to rm5.05 million from rm13.12 million a year ago on lower offshore crane works and other income. thhes plan to bid for fabrication jobs in india would not be the first time it is eyeing india for expansion. in april 2011, it signed a memorandum of understanding (mou) with indian company sew infrastructure ltd to jointly bid for similar jobs. at the time, thhe was listed as ramunia holdings bhd. however, after the partners failed to jointly secure a contract from indias oil and natural gas corp ltd (ongc), the mou was mutually terminated in june 2012. as ramunia, the group was also previously blacklisted for two years by ongc in 2009 over issues related to a us$685 million field development job. shares in thhe closed one sen or 9.5% higher at 11.5 sen last friday, giving the group a market capitalisation of rm128.94 million. in the past 12 months, the stock has fallen some 28%."}, "1": {"date_posted": "11/12/2017", "title":

that its net profit for the third quarter ended sept 30, 2017 (3qfy17) slipped a marginal 1.2% to rm417.43 million, from rm422.71 million a year ago, as a result of lower gross profit due to higher depreciation. petgas said in a filing with the local stock exchange that this was in line with the completion of capital projects and higher utilities cost of sales arising from upward fuel gas price revisions effective jan 1 and july 1. quarterly revenue saw a slight 0.4% year-on-year increase to rm1.163 billion, from rm1.158 billion, due to higher contribution from its utilities and regasification segments, offsetting lower gas processing and gas transportation revenue. petgas declared a third interim dividend of 16 sen per ordinary share, payable on dec 8, 2017. this brings its cumulative payout for fy17 to date to 50 sen, versus 45 sen in the same period last year. its net profit for the first nine months of fy17 (9mfy17) grew 2.5% y-o-y to rm1.306 billion, from rm1.274 billion, while cumulative revenue climbed 2.9% to rm3.506 billion, from rm3.407 billion. it said its comparable gross profit strengthened mainly due to higher other income arising from higher interest income and lower tax expenses, while topline grew because of higher utilities prices and volume, and higher regasification revenue. on prospects, petgas said its new liquiefied natural gas regasification terminal in pengerang, johor, which has a total capacity of 490 mmscfd (million metric standard cubic meter per day), has commenced commercial operation on nov 1, and will contribute to the groups revenue stream. the group also said it is currently awaiting details to be issued by the energy commission on the new requirements of gas supply (amendment) act 2016, for its gas transportation and regasification segments activities. the groups performance is expected to remain stable amidst the challenging economic environment, on the back of its strong and sustainable income streams from existing gas processing agreement, gas transportation agreements and regasification service agreement signed with petronas, the filing said. the group is also expecting its utilities

extended losses, pushing down the benchmark s&p 500 index as much as 1 percent, after republican senator bill cassidy, a member of the u.s. senate finance committee, said the senate tax proposal will delay a corporate tax cut by one year to 2019. major stock indexes came off their session lows after senator john cornyn said senate republicans were looking to avoid such a delay, yet remained in the red, it said. the dow jones industrial average fell 101.42 points, or 0.43 percent, to end at 23,461.94, the s&p 500 lost 9.76 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,584.62 and the nasdaq composite dropped 39.07 points, or 0.58 percent, to 6,750.05, said reuters. alliancedbs research in its evening edition thursday said the fbm klci had on nov 9 traded lower to 1,742.32 as some market participants continued to play on the selling side in anticipation of a lower market. however, it said non-follow through selling pressure in the area of 1,742.32 prompted supportive buying interest to chip in. the research house said this lifted the benchmark index to 1,749.31 before settling at 1,746.81 (up 2.61 points or 0.15%). in the broader market, gainers outnumbered losers with 431 stocks ending higher and 428 stocks finishing lower. that gave a market breadth of 1.01 indicating the bulls were in control with bears closely matched, it said. alliancedbs research said having closed near the days low in the previous day, the market saw follow through selling pressure on nov 9. however, the benchmark index did not go far down after the opening bell with only a days low of 1,742.32. this suggested that many market participants were unwilling to be aggressive in their selling game for fear of sudden market reversal. a closer study of the market behaviour in the last 10 days revealed that a consolidation platform between 1,740 and 1,752 is shaping up with both the buyers and sellers seen waiting for a catalyst to trigger the next market direction, it said. the research house said a crossover of 1,752 would see the market gearing towards the next overhead resistance at 1,767. it said following the up close on nov 9, there should be buying attempt. the analysis of overall market action on nov 9 revealed that buying power was stronger than selling pressure. as such, the fbm klci would likely trade above the 1,749.31 level on nov 10, said allliancedbs research. based on

which is 30.08%-owned by lembaga tabung haji, says its oil and gas fabrication unit has once again been barred by petronas from various job scopes due to its non-performance in a sabah project, this time without a specified timeline. its wholly-owned thhe fabricators sdn bhd (tfsb) received the letter on the exclusion from petronas, which stands for petroliam nasional bhd, on monday. in a filing today, thhe said the latest exclusion was in relation to tfsbs non-performance in relation to a contract known as procurement, construction and commissioning (pcc) of knpg-b topside ph ii, kinabalu non-associated gas (nag) development project (ph ii kinabalu project). the letter is another blow to tfsb, which is currently facing a two-year ban from participating in tenders by petronas carigali since april 4, 2016, due to what petronas carigali described as non-performance on tfsbs part under the same contract. now, the national oil company has excluded tfsb from being a main contractor, conducting major fabrication works, as well as any engineering, procurement, construction, installation, and/or commissioning works, not just for all its subsidiaries, but also for any petroleum arrangement contractors (pacs). the exclusion takes effect from the date of the letter, thhe said. petronas, including its subsidiaries and pacs, shall not award any new contract to tfsb for the above scopes and tfsb shall not be allowed to participate in any tender related to the above scopes, thhe added. the letter also states that the upliftment of the exclusion will be subject to tfsb satisfactorily meeting petronas requirements, which were not mentioned in the letter, it added. thhe said it will seek clarification from petronas, as the contract mentioned had been novated to a third party on oct 24, 2016, with the consent of petronas carigali  and that the third party had assumed all rights, interests and responsibilities under the contract. the contracts performance now rests with the third party. the novation also released and discharged tfsb from all liabilities under the contract, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the novation agreement, the filing added. thhe said it will take appropriate measures to mitigate the matter, including appealing to petronas  but added it does not anticipate participating in petronas upstream tenders this year. nevertheless, tfsb is still able to bid for other scopes under petronas licence, thhe said. in addition, any impact is further mitigated by diversification by tfsb into onshore fabrication, fabrication of specialised equipment, offshore fabrication opportunities regionally, and shipbuilding and ship repairs, the filing added. petronas carigali first awarded the ph ii kinabalu contract to tfsb on jan 28, 2014. when it received the two-year exclusion from petronas carigali, thhe argued at that time, saying the project had achieved an onshore construction completion of approximately 91%,

"22": {"date_posted": "1/8/2017", "title": "prestariangs transformation gets a cold shoulder ", "article": " after four long year, prestariang bhd last week finally closed the deal for the coveted immigration and border transformation project, skin, worth rm3.5 billion. an acronym for sistem kawalan imigresen nasional (national immigration control system), skin is a 15-year concession that was supposed to be the key catalyst that would help to justify the groups lofty valuations. but the market does not appear to be convinced. following the announcement last week, prestariangs share price tumbled almost 12.2% to close at rm2.09 last thursday, down from the rm2.38 close pre-announcement. even the groups bullish outlook on its existing core businesses did not seem to sway investors. we expect revenue from our software and services segment to grow by 25% in fy2018, president and group ceo dr abu hassan ismail told the press last week. furthermore, he says the groups training and certification business is expected to see revenue double, fuelled by the prestariang skill training institute (psti) in petronas refinery and petrochemical integrated development (rapid) project in pengerang, johor. abu hassan also assures investors that the groups loss-making education arm, unimy, would break even this year. last but not least, he made sure to play up educloud  prestariangs venture into shared cloud services. but even with partners like alibaba, microsoft and amazon web services, market response has been tepid.  why the poor response? for starters, it is important to note that analysts concur prestariangs profits should improve going forward, from the third quarter at least. a report by cimb investment bank anticipates core earnings to expand by 143% year on year to 17 sen per share in fy2018. even the more conservative estimates by aminvestment bank forecasts core earnings per share to rise 80% y-o-y to 11 sen. the trouble is, the earnings upside simply arent enough to justify the stocks lofty valuations. as at last thursdays close, prestariang was valued at a whopping 112 times earnings. of course, this is expected to fall once the earnings growth trickles in. the fact that prestariang will only control 70% of the skin project did not help matters either.  70%  not enough skin in the game for context, it is important to remember that back when news first broke that prestariang was bidding for the skin project, the expected value of the contract was much higher  as much as rm6 billion. this helped to drive prestariangs share price to over rm3.20 in early 2016. however, uncertainty over whether it could actually bag the contract brought the share price back down to the rm2.20 level over the past year. the companys tumbling earnings (see chart) could not have supported such a high share price either. investors long in the stock at this point were largely betting on the upside potential of skin. thus, it was a relatively nasty surprise that prestariang only has a 70% stake in the concession. recall that the actual concession has been awarded to prestariang skin sdn bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of prestariang services sdn bhd. however, prestariang only controls 70% of prestariang services. another 30% of the company is controlled equally by muhammad nagib gopal abdullah, raja azmi adam nadarajan and faisalludin mohamat yusuff. when asked why a 30% stake was given to these three individuals, abu hassan simply says, these are the original founding members. they are not somebody else. they were actually physically with us from day one, and they continue to be with us to add value to make sure they deliver skin as part of their commitment to the government. note that raja azmi is the ceo of prestariang skin. whatever the reason however, the financial impact of giving away 30% of the project has not gone down well with investors. not only will this dilute the earnings from the concession, but prestariang is expected to bear the entire cost of funding the projects construction, approximately rm1billion over 36 months. assuming the project is 80% financed by debt, a 6% interest rate translates into rm95 million in accrued interest over the first three years of the project. to make matters worse, the exact returns on the project are rather opaque since the internal rate of return (irr) is not disclosed. we have signed a non-disclosure agreement with the government. we are not allowed to reveal the projects irr, abu hassan tells the edge. instead, he simply guides that the project would reap about rm3.5 billion in revenue from year 4 to year 15 of the project. a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that works out to rm204.2 million per annum over the 12-year period. according to analyst reports, prestariangs management is guiding for a net profit margin of up to 38% a year. that works out to about rm77.6 million a year for the company or 16 sen a share.  no cash call? at the press briefing, abu hassan made a bold claim  that the entire project could be funded entirely with debt and internally generated funds alone. we have already secured the guarantees from the banks. the government would not award this project to us unless we show proof that we could finance it, explains abu hassan. an 80:20 debt to equity structure is entirely plausible given that prestariang is debt free, with rm38.6 million in cash and another rm51.9 million in short-term investments. assuming the short-term investments can be liquidated at book value, the company has net cash of rm90.5 million. thus abu hassan tells the edge, as things stand, we do not need to undertake a rights issue or a private placement for this project. of course, if something happens and we need to raise funds we will. however, it is interesting that prestariang will not be cutting back on dividend payouts. abu hassan insists that the group will maintain its 50% dividend payout policy. assuming the group manages to book the 11 sen to 17 sen earnings per share that analysts forecast, that works out to a payout between rm26.5 million and rm41 million a year. thats a pretty sizable cash flow drain. keep in mind that the skin concession has zero cash flow in the first three years. the government only begins to make payments from 2021 onwards. in fact, some analysts are a little more sceptical. aminvestment banks report prices in a potential dilution of 18.6% or 90 million new shares issued at rm2 apiece to finance the project. aminvestment actually downgraded its call on prestariang to hold with a target price of rm2. previously, it had made a buy call with a target price of rm2.60. this makes aminvestments call the most conservative on prestariang. the good news is that the project should have minimal operational risk. unlike highway concessions for example, which have uncertainty over traffic projections, skins revenue projections should be fairly accurate. this would allow the group to borrow at competitive rates. the flipside of course, is that there is minimal earnings upside. right now, the concession includes a provision for us to resize the project at regular intervals, and this has already been priced in. this ensures the system is always able to cope with fluctuations in [immigration] volumes, explains abu hassan. the only way the rm3.5 billion figure can increase is if the scope of the project grows due to the government adding new border entry points in the future, he explains.  educloud gets a mixed response anyone who had the opportunity to sit in on the presentation by abu hassan and his team last week would notice immediately that more than half of the slides were dedicated to prestariangs transformation. key to this transformation, will be educloud  a shared cloud services provider targeted at local educational institutions. in simple terms, educloud will enable malaysian universities to migrate their products, services and data to the cloud. this could range from administrative areas like student enrolment to the education side of the business, like study materials and lectures. in the long run however, educlouds vision is to introduce standardised student ids that the group hopes to monetise through other means like e-commerce or ride-sharing services. thus far, prestariang claims it has no trouble soliciting interest from the universities. our problem isnt getting interest. our problem now is making sure we can deliver. the universities see the value in what we are proposing. it can save them millions in costs, explains farad alhusaini, the cloud system orchestrator for prestariang digital sdn bhd. clearly, educloud is on a completely different tack from prestariangs other businesses. not surprisingly, there are some sceptics. it sounds great, but the immediate worry is whether educloud will be a drag on earnings. how quickly will it start turning a profit? one fund manager asks. he points to prestariangs education venture, unimy, which has been a drag on the groups earnings. the good thing about the shared cloud services however, is the fact that it does not require massive capex. we will rely on our partners to build the cloud storage for us  alibaba and amazon web services. we are more like brokers, explains farad. on a positive note, this simply means educloud could achieve scale very quickly. if anything, educloud has the most potential to surprise on the upside going forward. but just like skin, this will be new territory for prestariang and investors will be watching closely to see how well the group can execute such projects.

how did the ipos arrangers and promoters negotiate such a swift solution? what are the implications for future listings? speaking to bankers, regulators and fund managers, the edge takes a closer look at lcts peculiar listing.  what went wrong? short answer: lack of foreign interest in the ipo, and an absolute share price that was too high. long answer: the foreign investment banks advising on the deal appear to have grossly misjudged foreign institutional interest for lcts offering. one banker familiar with the deal says foreign institutions were initially expected to take up almost 50% of the offering, or almost rm2.95 billion of the rm5.9 billion worth of shares offered (at the initial estimate of rm8 per share). but when it came to the actual book building in late june, most of the foreign long funds  funds that take long positions  showed little interest in the placement. ultimately, foreign institutional investors would take up only 20% of the downsized institutional offering  rm710 million worth of shares. that means the global coordinators and joint bookrunners, credit suisse and jp morgan, had overestimated foreign appetite for lct by a whopping rm2.24 billion. at the same time, the book-building failed to get off the ground with the retail portion of 55.783 million shares undersubscribed by 38%. this has largely been blamed on the uncharacteristically high absolute share price of the ipo. of course, institutional investors dont care about absolute share price. they look at the valuation. but for retail investors, this could be a deterrent. and when you go for a listing this size, you definitely dont want to alienate any potential investors, notes another banker. it is understood that some bankers even pushed for a share split that would have brought the share price down to the rm2 to rm3 range. however, there is a simpler explanation  the offering was simply too big for this kind of stock. at the prospective rm8 per share, arrangers would have aimed to raise nearly rm446.26 million from retail investors. based on rm6.50 per share, only rm224 million was raised from retailers, but that figure will fall as many are expected to accept the companys buyback offer. this is not a stock that retail investors typically prefer. just look at petronas chemicals bhd. it is heavily institutionalised and boring for retail investors. that lct got as many retail subscriptions as it did is considered pretty good, the banker adds. keep in mind that with sufficient institutional interest, retail undersubscription would not be an issue due to the clawback and reallocation provisions that allow funds to take up the unsubscribed retail shares.  was the offering too ambitious? short answer: it was too big for the current market. long answer: lcts listing was seen as major test for the countrys capital market after two lacklustre years. it is interesting to note that lct has an incredibly strong balance sheet  with rm1.04 billion in cash and virtually no borrowings. there was no immediate urgency for the ipo, at least one to raise a whopping rm5.9 billion. around 83% of the proceeds was slated for the construction of a new petrochemical facility in indonesia over the next three years. a more conservative approach would have been to stagger the fundraising in two rounds. many smaller and more cautious ipos in recent years have taken this route  following up a relatively small ipo with a rights issue or private placement one or two years down the road. in fact, the downsizing of lcts ipo proves that this was a viable option all along. nonetheless, some bankers believe the initial sizing and pricing of the offering were not ambitious, given the information at the time. remember, we had the cornerstones come in at rm8. in fact, some had even indicated that they were happy to pay as much as rm8.60. furthermore, there was no indication that there would be such a poor turnout by foreign funds at the time, explains the first banker. he points out that larger ipos for similar types of companies have been done in the past. petronas chemicals managed to raise a record rm12.89 billion in 2010. of course, lct does not have a parent like petroliam nasional bhd. but it was raising less than half that amount and priced at a discount to petchem. the size and pricing of the offering was not unreasonable, he argues.  who paid the price? short answer: perhaps the investment banks and the promoters, but only very little. long answer: at face value, almost all stakeholders emerged with positive outcomes from the ipo. sure, lct would have liked to have raised more money but, objectively, no one party appears to have been hurt. in fact, an sc spokesperson points out that the transaction actually demonstrates the sophistication and flexibility of malaysias ipo framework in responding rapidly to market needs without compromising investor protection. after all, retail investors (and bumiputera investors approved by the ministry of international trade and industry) got a pretty good deal  a risk-free option to exit at rm6.50. furthermore, they have the opportunity to observe the post-listing share price until july 18 before deciding. had the share price improved after listing, retailers would have enjoyed the upside. as for the institutional investors, many were willing to pay rm7.60 to rm8 per share in the first book building. now, they enjoy a cheaper entry into the stock. furthermore, they were not forced to participate in the second book building. in addition, the stabilisation action provides an avenue for funds to exit over the first 30 days (or up to 27 million shares). meanwhile, the investment banks will have to settle for a smaller placement and underwriting fee due to the downsizing of the exercise. based on the 1.5% fee, and the downsizing of the ipo by rm2.13 billion, the investment banks would lose out on approximately rm32 million worth of fees. in contrast, the total listing expenses were estimated at rm152.9 million. however, this is a small price to pay. had the banks been forced to underwrite the shortfall, we might have had to subscribe for at least us$100 million to us$150 million (rm645 million) worth of shares. the six banks could have taken it on, but it would have been bad for the after-market performance of the shares. the banks would look to get rid of the shares and investors do not like this, explains the first banker. last but not least, lct itself should not be too displeased by the outcome. given the lack of foreign interest in the ipo, it is commendable that the deal was still closed, carried primarily by domestic funds. even though it was downsized to rm3.77 billion, lcts listing is still the largest in the region in recent years.  what are the implications? short answer: lcts listing is unprecedented but unlikely to make future ipos easier. long answer: lcts path to listing was certainly unconventional and it put the regulators flexibility to the test. despite the massive changes made to the ipo, it did not trigger section 238 of the capital markets and services act, which would have required the filing of a supplementary prospectus. this would certainly have delayed the listing. and an extended delay would have risked scuttling the entire exercise. however, the circumstances surrounding lcts listing were unique. it is highly unlikely that future ipos will be able to pull off a similar stunt. this is largely due to the nature of lcts business, as well as its healthy balance sheet and cash flow, which gave the company room to manoeuvre when the ipo was downsized. it is understood that article 238 was not triggered for two key reasons. first, and most crucially, the banks were able to show that the downsized ipo would not materially derail lcts business and its expansion plans. the group convinced regulators that it could still build its indonesian plant regardless of the smaller ipo. secondly, the change in size would not adversely affect the voting power of the shareholders. in fact, a smaller issuance increases the voting power of each share. the banks were also able to prove to the sc that institutional interest in the offering was still healthy. after all, many were already prepared to pay as much as rm8 a share. at rm6.50, many were eager to close the deal. this gave the regulator confidence in the viability of the resized deal, explained the second banker. thus, while lcts ipo certainly sets a precedent, it has not pioneered a new way for companies to approach an ipo. they cant just mess up their roadshows and book building and run to the sc for help, one veteran industry player tells the edge. if any precedent is being set, it is that the sc is applying and interpreting the laws in a more market savvy manner  ensuring transactions can be facilitated despite adverse market events. in the case of lcts listing, the sc did not apply the law in a rigid manner. instead, a lawyer points out that the sc examined the facts thoroughly, gave it careful thought, and then applied the law in a more judicious manner.

leaner, more focused and better prepared for the future. but what is next for our corporations and institutions? while it is acknowledged that we have strengthened the foundations of our many organisations, the world races on. if these newfound efficiencies are not rapidly leveraged in our path towards global championship, then the u00adpotential for regression in the way we compete and sustain advantage in markets at home and abroad will u00adremain high. in a digitally driven and fast-converging global economy, not only consumers but also public audiences determine business reputations and market values where performances reflected in stock prices are sometimes beyond the full control of companies and organisations. in the boardrooms of the branded, it is not just stock movements that are being actively tracked today. of equal importance is the impact of social media commentary as a parallel barometer on the health of companies, products and services. given that business agility remains important to corporate success, a critical aspect not yet dominant in our institutional mindset is how to relate business performance with market perception or stock price with consumer sentiment. the solution to strengthening this linkage is brand power  the ability to attract, manage and sustain market support better than the competition. malaysian companies are already strong but when not reinforced with the right foundations, the best of structures can break down. similarly, the strongest of businesses can quickly lose dominance without the support of loyal markets at home and elsewhere. the crucial next step, which will define our future efforts and legacy as a nation, is not just continuous transformation but the bastion of brand power. to effectively compete on the world stage, we need to build the essential pillars of brand building in form (identity), character (credibility) and delivery (experience). in other words, we cannot create brands only at design, marketing or communications level but elevate brand building to the policy level of the organisation to be championed by boards as a business strategy. if the future of any enterprise depends on the growth and retention of favourable markets, why is stronger brand learning and investment not a board policy to be instituted and monitored for strategic impact?  brand-aware, not brand-driven the answer to this question is that most of us are brand-aware but not yet brand-driven. as consumers, when we think of a brand, we recall a visual or a jingle: a name, symbol, tune or a combination of all to identify the producer or retailer of a certain product or service. in their tangible forms, brands are recognised through the familiarity of logos, colours, marketing materials and other physical or digital expressions. however, we also know that a brand is more than just a name and a logo. we connect with the brands we support as we like what we see, what we feel and what we remember in our experience with them better than the others. whether it is a bank, a detergent, a favourite apparel brand, a mobile service provider or the way we choose to transport ourselves, we remain faithful to our chosen brands like timeworn friends through the trust built and the promise of delivery between customer and producer. but what has this brand affinity got to do with the making of malaysias global champions? and why should companies be more brand-driven? consider this. if market goodwill drives bottom-line performances through how consumers applaud and differentiate organisations for their products and services, why is the building of brands (which includes the corporate or institutional brand) not embedded in business policy to guide and converge management thinking within current business planning objectives and processes? and why do we not invest enough in what our consumers see, feel and experience in our offerings, especially in markets populated by those with the power to attract and retain market support? why do we not enhance our competences to confidently enter and grow markets the same way as the branded?  barriers to better branding in malaysia, the barriers to better brand building and goodwill management are many: u2022 absence of essential brand pillars. as a developing economy, there is a tendency to adopt mature-market knowledge and practices to u00adshorten learning curves in everything we do, from strategic planning to production, operations, marketing, distribution and sales. while much of our success has been premised on the production and marketing of goods and services that is comparable to the best in the world, not many have achieved competitiveness through brand power without the convergence of the essential brand pillars  board policy, commitment, investment and knowhow; u2022 stage of market readiness. in transitioning from production to market orientation, there is an urgent need to evolve developed market practices to one that better suits our stage of market readiness for greater brand success. for example, brand responsibility still resides with product development, marketing or communications, and is not yet conceptualised and designed at strategic levels of the organisation. products and services are often developed without brand thinking, thereby negating the effectiveness of marketing and promotional support when it is left too late. finally, brand investments u00adbeyond marketing and advertising are seldom adequate to get the product or service brand right in the downstream phase of marketing and distribution; and u2022 brands as an expense, not strategic assets. without policy-driven investments to u00adensure the evolution of a living brand with the potential to become a market winner, measuring the impact of brand investments on business performance is seldom executed. this constraint continues to hamper better brand thinking and commitments at many of our organisations.  global champions with investment in brand building generally limited to advertising and promotions (a&p), in emerging markets, with the exception of a few in asia  toyota, samsung, sony, honda, hyundai, canon, nissan, panasonic, kia, huawei and lenovo  not many made it to interbrands top 100 as brand-driven global champions last year. in a 2016 regional exploration of consumer u00adattitudes, airasia (41) was the lone made in malaysia brand among asias top 100 brands ranked by global information and insight provider, nielsen. among asias top 1,000 brands in 2016 were maybank (397), mister potato (398), petronas (409), spritzer (470), poh kong (506), malaysia airlines (514), habib (607), boh (608), maxis (636), firefly (713), mamee (730), poslaju (737), cimb bank (741), caring pharmacy (760), celcom (871), bonia (913), digi (914), takaful malaysia (925) and mydin (938). the survey with 6,400 respondents from 13 asian markets (including australia) and across 14 major categories tracked the most popular brands in asia from a consumer perspective. the robustness of the malaysian brand will depend on the brand power of our homegrown champions. twenty-one brands or 2% of the 1,000 most-favoured asian brands is a start but if brand equity (the market value a brand potentially generates) is a significant business performance indicator, then more companies need to be empowered with the knowledge and capability. this is not only to retain the goodwill that drove returns on investments in the past but also to confidently compete for market support in the future. the endgame for malaysia is to champion at least five made in malaysia brands into interbrands top 100 and target 100 placements on asias top 1,000 brands by 2030. targeting 10 global championships and brand positions over 15 years, south korea, starting in the late 1990s, continues to run the fastest and most impressive brand race in asia. with the full commitment of malaysian boards, ceos and u00adrelated stakeholders, we will be able to u00adaccomplish the same, if not more. the sooner we start, the better. yasmin merican is the founder and principal of trax

letter to say that they support the rights issue, as well as to take up the remaining rights not taken up by other shareholders via the redeemable convertible preference shares (rcps), umw-og president rohaizad darus told reporters after the groups annual general meeting yesterday. on may 4, umw-og proposed to raise up to rm1.81 billion via a rights issue of up to 6.05 billion new shares together with up to 1.51 billion free warrants at an issue price of 30 sen per rights share. out of the total gross proceeds from the rights issue, umw-og is planning to utilise rm1.5 billion to repay borrowings, rm310 million for working capital and the rest for expenses of the corporate exercise. umw holdings bhd, which holds a 55.73% stake in umw-og, is exiting its oil and gas business and will refocus on its core businesses of automotive, equipment, and manufacturing and engineering. this will see pnb turn major shareholder with a 45.5% stake in umw-og post-demerger, while the employees

answer the cash call. the lower issue price of 30 sen is to make it more attractive to investors. but at that kind of price, the groups share capital will increase from two billion to eight billion, aminvestment bank analyst alex goh told the edge financial daily. in a filing with bursa malaysia yesterday, umw-og said it has bagged two contracts worth a combined us$34.81 million (rm150.38

another contract is to provide its naga 4 jack-up rig to drill two firm wells, both commencing in june. the provision of the drilling rig services is expected to contribute positively to the earnings and net assets of umw-og group during the contract period principally for the financial period ending dec 31, 2017 and the financial period thereafter. goh said the contracts are not expected to lift umw-ogs share price. the contracts wont [significantly improve our valuation] as charter rates are not at a rate that is going to be very profitable. i still expect the group to operate at a loss, he added. hong leong investment bank analyst lim sin kiat concurred, noting other key concerns dragging the share price down. securing more contracts is good, but there is a share price overhang with the rights issue, said lim, adding that the counter may also face a one-off selldown after umw holdings completes the distribution of its stake in umw-og to its shareholders. i dont think they (the shareholders) will hold [the stock]. lim, however, opined that the rights issue is the best way for umw-og to source its fund right now, lest risking a jump in gearing. it is very tough, as you cannot take in more debt. the rig market is not cash generative at the moment. the only other way is by equity funding or rights issue. or unless its major shareholder agrees to the issuance of preferred stock, which is what they are doing now, lim said. from the rights issue, any additional rights shares undertaken by pnb beyond its 65% shareholding limit will be converted to islamic rcps. following the termination of a three-way merger with icon offshore bhd and orkim sdn bhd on may 4, shares in umw-og have fallen 30% from 89 sen to close at 62 sen yesterday. meanwhile, rohaizad said umw-og will have secured full utilisation of its seven rigs under management come june, but subdued charter day rates remain a dead weight for the struggling downstream oil and gas player. he said said the group is expecting more contracts this year as oil companies are coming back to develop and invest. what happened before is that there were uncertainties with regard to how low the oil prices will go. now, with the reduction in opec and non-opec production, the stabilisation sits at around us$50 per barrel or so, said rohaizad, adding that anything above that level is a bonus. we hope that with the 33

surprise, given its substantial contract value, according to ta securities. however, ta securities maintained its \"sell\" rating with a target price of 96 sen as it sees the company's near-term earnings weakness persisting, underpinned by low yard utilisation. mhb has secured a new rm1 billion contract from petronas carigali sdn bhd, which involves engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning works for the central processing platform (cpp) at bokor phase 3 re-development project, the research house said. first steel cut is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2018 (3q18), and the project is targeted for completion in mid-2q20, the research house added. \"assuming a net margin of 4%, this new contract could potentially contribute profit of rm6 million/rm18 million in fy18/fy19,\" said ta securities, adding that inclusive of this new project win, it estimates that the group has an outstanding orderbook of rm1.6 billion. \"on the flipside, we are disappointed by the late commencement date of this new project (1st steel cut: 3q18). therefore, we deem this contract as part of fy18 orderbook replenishment,\" said ta securities, adding that profit recognition will likely to start from fy19. with the new contract win, ta securities tweaked its fy18 assumption higher to rm1.5 billion, which raised fy18/fy19 core profit forecast to rm24 million/rm48 million from the previous rm18 million/rm30 million. meanwhile, aminvestment bank maintained its \"hold\" recommendation on mhb with an unchanged fair value of rm1 based on a 40% discount to fy17 book valuation. \"the stock currently trades at a p/bv (price-to-book value) of 0.6x due to the likelihood of further operating losses from the upstream sector's slow project rollouts,\" said aminvestment bank. aminvestment bank noted that even with higher yard utilisation in 4qfy16, mhb's 4qfy16 revenue declined 9% quarter-on-quarter, which resulted in a core loss of rm40 million, including additional one-off margins from marine change orders. hence, the group's earnings momentum is unlikely to gain traction this year, said aminvestment bank. \"[the] management acknowledged the slow rollout of upstream jobs, as scheduled awards have been postponed due to the uncertain oil price trajectory,\" said aminvestment bank. \"this bokor project is much needed for mhb's west yard as its current yard utilisation of 50% to 60% could drop to a relatively idle capacity with the completion of the baronia cpp and f12 kumang topside by 1hfy17,\" added aminvestment bank. aminvestment bank said only the covered workshops in the west and east yards will be busy with the five packages worth rm246 million from refinery and petrochemical integrated development. at 12.02pm, shares in

"  kuala lumpur: dancomech holdings bhd  which was the best-performing initial public offering in 2016  is hoping to grow its revenue and profit by about 15% for the current year as it expands its operations in malaysia and indonesia. managing director daniel aik (pic) said the groups growth for the year ending dec 31, 2017 (fy17) will be partly driven by the expected pickup in the palm oil industry in indonesia after a slight slowdown in fy16. indonesia is a sunrise market for us, especially when you talk about the palm oil-based business. we intend to expand our product offering in indonesia within the year, he said in an interview with the edge financial daily. daniel pointed out that the group in january signed an agreement with chun khong engineering works sdn bhd for the acquisition of a pump factory in ipoh, which currently caters mainly to the malaysian palm oil mill market. currently, dancomech already supplies valves to its palm oil-based clients in indonesia and plans to begin supplying pumps sometime within 2017. this would provide additional revenue for the company, and we will be selling the pumps to the same customer base as our valves, so we dont need to incur extra costs in terms of human resources. we anticipate sales from indonesia will increase this year, now that the palm oil sector is picking up in line with the better crude palm oil (cpo) price at the moment. we anticipate a revenue growth of 5% to 10% at least for indonesia this year, daniel said. he added that dancomech is considering setting up a distribution office in indonesia in the future, if the prospects are good. meanwhile, for the malaysian market, dancomech executive director johnson aik said the group will push through with its plans to set up distribution offices in johor as well as in east malaysia, in bintulu and miri. we will set up not only offices but we will also keep some stock there to provide better service to our customers, as in faster delivery and easier engagement with potential clients, he said. johnson added that setting up the offices will also translate into cost savings, as the group would be using sea freight to transport its inventory to the offices, rather than airfreighting its products straight to the end-consumer, which is more expensive. he said that the potential for bintulu is great as the district has the largest palm oil refinery capacity in malaysia, while an office in johor provides the group proximity to petronas refinery and petrochemical integrated development (rapid) in pengerang. johnson said the group is also eyeing to secure some ad hoc work at rapid. with our expansion plans for the year, we expect to register [a] growth of about 15% this year, he said. for fy16, the group reported a 16% increase in net profit to rm12.85 million or 9.5 sen per share, from rm10.99 million a year earlier. however, revenue fell 12% year-on-year to rm60 million, partly due to lower contribution from indonesia. that was due to slower activity in the indonesian palm oil industry, as there was a bit of an oversupply situation. the low cpo price last year was also a factor. but we expect activity to pick up this year, explained johnson. currently, dancomech supplies valves to a number of industries, including palm oil, oil and gas (o&g), water as well as rubber glove factories. the largest contributors are the palm oil-based industries and o&g, contributing about 60% and 25% of the groups revenue per year. dancomechs share price closed down one sen or 0.69% at rm1.43 last friday, giving it a market

polymers business, is confident of achieving a strong double-digit profit growth for the second straight year notwithstanding the current economic uncertainty and volatile crude oil prices. the group had reported a 51.02% increase in net profit to rm11.15 million for the year ended may 31, 2016 (fy16), after registering a 7.2% decline in the bottom line to rm7.39 million in fy15 from rm7.96 million in fy14. for the first half of fy17, the group saw a 69.46% hike in net profit to rm6.58 million, from rm3.88 million in the same period of fy16. this is despite a 9.62% drop in revenue to rm587.51 million from rm650.08 million. the market condition [has] stabilised. barring any unforeseen circumstances, the [fy17] earnings should be better than last years, said nylex managing director datuk dr siew ka wei. the group attributed the jump in fy16 net profit to better showing by its industrial chemicals division, which generated a higher profit before tax of rm11.9 million, against rm10.6 million in fy15, due to higher sales volume and improved margins. founded in 1970, nylex is principally involved in investment holding and the manufacturing and marketing of vinyl-coated fabrics, calendered film and sheeting and other plastic products, including geotextiles and prefabricated sub-soil drainage systems. about 89% of the groups revenue is contributed by the industrial chemical division. another 10% is derived from the polymer division, while the logistics division accounts for the remaining 1%. nylex currently has offices in the entire southeast asian region except for thailand and the philippines. it is now seeking to expand into the remaining two southeast asian markets. we are one of the largest distributors. we have been in the distribution business since 1982, said siew. he said the group does not focus on any one type of business, with the diversified business serving as a natural hedge. siew added that the logistics division, which was incorporated into the groups business model during the current financial year, would help nylex integrate operationally and enhance efficiency. [with the logistics division], it will be a fully integrated operation and it can provide customers with a lot of convenience, he said, adding that the group will enjoy a cost advantage and also save its time. we try to strengthen the supply chain, so that it can support the distribution division, he said. looking back at the groups performance over the years, siew said profits continued to rise until 2008 when the oil prices continue to move up. he said that during the global financial crisis in 2008, most businesses stop stocking their products in the southeast asian region but nylex continued to stock its products and made good profits a year later. we are strong because we own tanks and we have long-term leases, he added. last april, nylex signed a contract for the construction and purchase of a chemical tanker. constructed by hakata ship building co ltd of japan, the tanker sailed to malaysia last month. nylex is in the process of getting the necessary certification for the tanker from petrolium nasional bhd (petronas) and going forward, it is expected to be contributing positively. nylex has cited the purchase of the tanker as the main factor for its borrowings amounting to rm126.27 million. our net debt is considerably low compared with other companies in the industry. there was this one meeting that we had and the fund manager said that we under-borrowed and should borrow more, said siew. on expansion plans, siew said nylex is looking at any business which is profitable. the group, he said, will continue its focus on cost control measures and increase operational efficiencies in order to improve profitability of its manufacturing business for both the polymer division and the industrial chemical division, and consider new opportunities of expanding the distribution network for its distribution business. nylexs share price rose 22% over the past year to 70.5 sen last friday, with a market capitalisation at rm135.3 million. it is currently trading at a trailing 12-month price-earnings ratio of 9.63 times. siew said the share price is undervalued as the groups net asset per share is at rm1.70. he added that the groups market value should be around rm300 million."}, "50": {"date_posted": "8/2/2017", "title": "misc falls on subsidiary net loss", "article": " kuala lumpur (feb 8): misc bhd dropped as much as 10 sen or 1.3% after its 66.5%-owned subsidiary malaysia marine and heavy engineering holdings bhd (mhb) said fourth quarter net loss widened to rm119.67 million from a year earlier. shares of shipping entity misc fell to their lowest so far today at rm7.45. at 10:30am, misc was transacted at rm7.47 with 44,300 shares traded. mhb shares fell three sen to 98 sen at 10:34am. petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) owns 62.67% of misc. \"mhb's net loss is one of the major reasons for the drop in misc's share price today,\" affin hwang investment bank bhd analyst aaron kee told theedgemarkets.com. but in our opinion, mhb does not contribute significantly to miscs earnings as misc has a huge market capitalisation. we believe the drag on miscs earnings in financial year 2017 will come from its petroleum tanker sector as well as its liquefied natural gas sector, kee said. yesterday, mhb announced that net loss swelled to rm119.67 million in the fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2016 (4qfy16) from a net loss of rm27.13 million. for the full year, mhb posted a net loss of rm134.3 million compared with a net profit of rm43.89 million a year earlier. today, analysts downgraded mhb on its latest financials. kenanga investment bank bhd analyst sean lim ooi leong wrote in a note that kenanga cut its fy17 earnings forecast for mhb by 56.5% to rm16.8 million. lim said kenanga also downgraded mhb shares to \"underperform\" with a lower target price of 96 sen.

conditional letter of award. umw naga 7 is a premium independent-leg cantilever jack-up rig. the commencement of the charter was not indicated but it is expected to contribute to financial year 2017 (fy17) earnings. similar to past charter announcements, the group did not provide any details on naga 7s daily charter rate. however, we expect it to be similar to the weak southeast asian jack-up rates which have fallen to us$70,000 (rm312,200) from us$90,000 in mid-2015 on utilisation below 50%. recall that umw-og secured a short-term charter in october last year for a minimum of 50 days for its naga 2 jack-up rig, starting in second quarter of 2017 (2q17), from for the marginal ophir field in terengganu. the group also managed to secure an 18-month charter in october 2016 for its naga 8 jack-up rig from hess exploration and production malaysia bv to operate in the north malay basin, off peninsular malaysia. the contract commenced in november 2016 and is attached with an option to extend for a further 12 months. at this stage, we understand that the other operating rig is naga 6, which is chartered to petronas carigali for two years with an option for extension for another year, while the other four rigs (including naga 1) in the fleet are warm stacked. the new naga 7 charter is a positive development but with a fleet utilisation likely to reach only 50% at best this year, the groups losses and negative cash flow are unlikely to abate in the near term unless there is a significant breakthrough in securing new charters. with a negative earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of rm14 million in nine months of financial year 2016, the group still requires further refinancing for its short-term debt. we do not discount the possibility of a dilutive corporate exercise arising from a likely restructuring of the groups debt profile. hence, the stock currently trades at a 34% discount to its latest book value of rm1.38 a share, which could be eroded by further losses and asset impairments.  aminvestment bank, jan 5"}, "53": {"date_posted": "1/12/2016", "title": "eps growth for msian corporates to exceed 5%", "article": "  kuala lumpur: aberdeen asset management asia ltd (aberdeen asia) sees earnings per share (eps) growth for malaysian public-listed companies to come in between 5% and 10% in 2017, driven by oil prices, domestic consumption, and the growth of the global economy. david smith, who is head of corporate governance at aberdeen asia, said the eps growth of malaysian corporates is expected to be higher than the forecast 4% to 5% of gross domestic product growth for malaysia in 2017. whats positive for us on malaysian equities is that domestic consumption has stayed resilient despite the goods and services tax [implemented in 2015]. we think malaysia is somewhat attractive within this region, [but it comes down to] stock selection. we have to find companies that are going to be leveraging off domestic consumption and demand, he said at a news conference in conjunction with aberdeens augmented reality presentation yesterday. aberdeen asia-pacific head of multi-asset solutions irene goh said that at present, malaysia and other asian equity markets are not seeing a multiple expansion in indices due to uncertainties such as the pressure on currencies and capital flight from emerging markets. hopefully when we get to 2017, there will be more clarity on trade policies, and [if] donald trump the pragmatist and businessman shows up in the white house rather than donald trump the populist, maybe we can get tailwinds that are supportive of better market performance for equities in the region, she said. as for the outlook for fixed income investment in malaysia, aberdeen islamic asset management investment manager mohammad hasif said that bonds with longer terms, or at the long end of the curve, are attractive. at aberdeen, we have been fundamentally positive on malaysia for some time, so we took opportunities in the longer end of the malaysian bond space, basically 20- to 30-year malaysian government securities, as we think that part looks attractive, even on a forward-looking basis. the longer end of the malaysian government bond space has generally been well supported by the employees provident fund, insurance companies and pension funds, so we think that part of the bond curve is well anchored, he said. mohammad hasif said another theme adopted by aberdeen is to move into us dollar malaysian bonds. us dollar malaysian issuances such as petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) issuances and axiata group bhds [us dollar bonds] which have [been] sold off and had been expensive previously, have now started to look quite cheap. so what we have done is switching from some of our expensive bonds such as [south] korean us dollar bonds to some of the malaysian bonds which have started to look cheap after the sell-off. for us dollar credits, we look at it more on a spread basis as opposed to an outright yield. we are fundamentally positive on these companies. petronas, for example, despite the [low] oil prices, has had a very disciplined management of its finances, and has a very pragmatic management of its capex (capital expenditure) programmes. so with that, and a cheap valuation, it was a very easy decision for us to make, he said. total assets under management for aberdeen asia amounted to us$76.2 billion (rm339.85 billion) as at september 2016."}, "54": {"date_posted": "17/11/2016", "title": "lim to inject wct assets into pavilion reit ", "article": "  businessman tan sri desmond lim siew choon is performing a corporate manoeuvre that may unlock value worth billions after emerging as the largest shareholder in wct holdings bhd last tuesday, say sources. at the heart of lims plan is the injection of wcts three shopping malls into pavilion real estate investment trust (reit), in which he and his wife, tan kewi yong, together hold a 37.35% stake. this will, in turn, help wct clean up its balance sheet and lower its gearing ratio, which analysts believe will remove a persistent discount on the companys share price. while wct had previously mooted a possible reit listing of its malls by the end of the year, injecting them into an existing reit would prove faster and easier to accomplish. analysts have pegged a valuation of rm1.2 billion to wcts three malls, namely paradigm mall in petaling jaya, aeon bukit tinggi shopping centre in klang and [emailprotected] in sepang. the group has another paradigm mall coming up in johor baru that is scheduled to open next april, according to its website. to recap, lim got the market excited last tuesday after he surfaced in wct as its biggest shareholder with a 19.67% stake. his vehicle, dominion nexus sdn bhd, had acquired the shares in a direct deal from wct capital sdn bhd, which is the vehicle of wct co-founders peter taing kim hwa and wong sewe wing. the acquisition price was not disclosed to bursa malaysia. however, bloomberg data shows that several blocks of shares transacted at rm2.50 apiece last tuesday, representing a premium of 42.85% to the stocks closing price of rm1.75 that day. at rm2.50 each, the transaction would have cost lim a total of rm614.3 million. following the property tycoons emergence in wct, the company saw a boardroom shake-up with the old guard making way for lims new line-up. in a flurry of filings with bursa last wednesday, wct announced that datuk capt ahmad sufian @ qurnain abdul rashid had given up his post as board chairman. lim is taking his place as executive chairman with immediate effect. meanwhile, taing has resigned as managing director, citing his cessation as a substantial shareholder of the group. executive director wong yik kae, who is sewe wings son, has also exited the company to pursue personal interests, as has non-executive director choo tak who. two independent, non-executive directors  tan sri marzuki mohd noor and datuk abdul wahab khalil  have been named to the board, as has datuk lee tuck fook as non-independent, non-executive director. property developer malton bhd, in which lim and his wife hold 35.34% equity interest via malton corp sdn bhd, also announced last tuesday that lim will be redesignated from executive chairman to non-independent, non-executive chairman from jan 2. it cited lims entry into wct as the reason he relinquished his executive role in malton. while the exact terms of the mall injection are unclear for now, a cash payment for the assets would be a boon for wct, which has been saddled with high gearing and a capital-intensive property operation that has been dragging its cash flow. as at june 30, wct had total borrowings of rm2.73 billion, rm578.5 million cash and total equity of rm2.707 billion, which translated into a net gearing ratio of 0.79 times. the group burnt cash in four of six consecutive financial quarters up to june 30. an analyst suggests that this may be why the stock is relatively undervalued despite jumping 5.9% the day after news broke about the emergence of a new shareholder. it closed at rm1.80 last wednesday. its price-earnings ratio (per) that day was 10.92 times compared with its peers average of 16.73 times, based on bloomberg data. hong leong investment bank and aminvestment bank ascribed a sum-of-parts (sop) valuation of rm3.52 billion and rm3.98 billion respectively to wct compared with its market value of rm2.25 billion at the close of trading last thursday. the sop valuations translate into an implied share price of rm2.12 and rm2.38 each. this means lim may have put a much higher valuation on wct if he had indeed bought in at rm2.50 apiece on nov 1. the huge premium may also represent a carrot to wcts co-founders to exit immediately rather than pursue a longer-term, value-unlocking strategy via the original reit listing proposal. one possibility is that the rm2.50 share price is the valuation lim is eyeing when the dust settles on his upcoming plan to unlock value in wct via malton and pavilion reit. of course, there would be concerns [among the minority shareholders] over whether the valuation is fair, says an analyst. sources say following the injection of wcts malls into pavilion reit, the next step could be to streamline maltons construction business into wct, which is far larger and has an established track record. for perspective, maltons market capitalisation as at nov 3 was rm302.7 million or just under 14% that of wct. wcts construction order book stands at rm4.28 billion, a quarter of which is from its contracts totalling rm1.1 billion at the petronas refinery and petrochemical integrated development project. its construction arm saw total revenue of rm1.51 billion in the second quarter ended june 30 (2qfy2016), of which 58% were external sales. in comparison, maltons construction arm reported a turnover of rm503.7 million in 2qfy2016  57.4% of which was internal, meaning it was undertaking its own construction projects. with a common major shareholder in lim, these construction jobs are likely to be fed to wct, boosting the latters construction business. streamlining the construction businesses under wct would pave the way for malton to focus on its property business, which is what the company is primarily known for. similarly, wcts property division is relatively small compared with its larger operation as a group. in 2qfy2016, this segment accounted for only 14.7% of quarterly group revenue, although its contribution to operating profit was larger at 43.1%. analysts generally agree that it is still early days to tell how the minority shareholders will be affected by lims plan. in a nov 2 report, alliancedbs research says lims emergence has cast uncertainty on the future direction of the company until more details are announced. hlib echoes the sentiment, saying a potential risk is a significant change in wcts strategic direction. other analysts, however, feel that lims presence as a shareholder is an upside for wct, given his successful pavilion brand name, noted business acumen and reputation for deal-making. for now, this is a space to watch for corporate malaysia observers.

albeit with thin trading volume of 15,700 shares. petdag was the top loser across the local bourse today. the current price values it at rm23.17 billion. it told bursa malaysia yesterday (aug 15) that its net income for 2qfy16 fell 21.3% on year to rm214.95 million while revenue slipped 17.5% to rm5.33 billion. petdag recorded a net profit of rm273.21 million in the same quarter last year, with a revenue of rm6.47 billion. it declared an interim dividend of 14 sen a share, payable on sept 9. for the first half ended june 30, 2016 (1hfy16), net profit declined 9.3% to rm434.35 million from rm478.98 million in the same period last year  again mainly because of a weaker retail segment  while revenue fell 18.3% to rm10.24 billion from rm12.54 billion. in a note to clients today, midf research maintained its \"neutral\" call with unchanged target price of rm23.57 on the stock. according to the firm, petdag's earnings was broadly in line with expectations, accounting for 57% and 51% of its and consensus fy16 earnings estimates respectively. it noted petdag made a gain on disposal of its 100%-owned petronas (vietnam) co ltd to totalgaz vietnam co ltd resulting in a net gain on disposal of rm31.5 million during the quarter. on petdag's retail segment, midf research said both revenue and profit posted declines of 13% and 25.8% respectively due to a 14% decline in average selling price, which had impacted the diesel and mogas fuel contributions. \"the declines were further exacerbated by impairment charge on receivables of rm89.9 million and higher operating expenditure,\" it added. the impairment was for subsidy claims made to the government on the sale of diesel at a subsidised price during 2012 and 2013, it said, noting that these claims have been long outstanding since then. the research house said the revenue and operating profit of the commercial segment declined by 24.3% to rm4.44 billion and by 5.3% to rm285.9 million respectively. \"these were largely due to the 26% drop in average selling prices of aviation fuel and diesel coupled with lower sales volume for diesel,\" it explained. midf research made no changes on petdag's earnings forecasts at this juncture as average selling prices remain under pressure. "}, "65": {"date_posted": "11/8/2016", "title": "cover story:corporate malaysia paid lower dividends in 1q2016 ", "article": "  in the current low interest rate environment, investors are increasingly turning to dividend-paying stocks for yields and safety. despite declining earnings in the past two years, most companies listed on bursa malaysia have been able to maintain their dividend payouts at above 3%. however, some pertinent questions come to mind, especially for income investors: can the companies maintain dividends amid a slowing economy? what sectors and companies are reducing dividends? and more importantly, are there any sectors or companies that are paying better dividends? by compiling data from cash flow statements, chart 1 shows the dividends paid to shareholders in the past five years and the first quarter of 2016. while companies may pay dividends in the next quarter after they have declared the quantum, most of them pay out at a predictable frequency and time every year, making such cash flow data comparable on a year-on-year basis. that said, it should be noted that the dividend data from cash flow statements is lagging by a quarter and it disregards the sources of the funds, that is, the dividends could come from non-operating activities. for instance, companies could sell their assets and pay dividends with the proceeds. as shown in chart 1, dividends paid by bursa-listed companies dropped 6.3% to rm11.6 billion from a year ago, albeit by a lesser extent compared with an 18.4% fall in aggregate 1q2016 corporate earnings. sectors that paid lower dividends in the first quarter  a rm2.3 billion reduction  include plantation, telecommunications, oil and gas and automotive (see chart 2).  dividend cut by heavyweight sectors the plantation sector accounted for 28.7% of the rm2.3 billion reduction in dividends, followed by conglomerate (26%), telecommunications (17.3%), oil and gas equipment and services (5.8%) and automotive (3.8%). together, the five sectors (based on bloomberg classification) accounted for 82% of the amount. at the company level, conglomerate sime darby bhd saw the biggest reduction in dividend payout  rm639 million  in the first quarter due to lower earnings from its plantation, industrial and motor segments (see table 1). note that the plantation segment was the groups largest earnings contributor, accounting for a quarter of its revenue and a third of its operating income in fy2015. other plantation companies that cut dividend sharply include kuala lumpur kepong bhd (klk) and ioi corp bhd, which were affected by weak crude palm oil prices last year. while klk saw its fy2015 earnings fall 12.3% to rm869.9 million from a year ago, ioi corps earnings plunged 95% to rm168.1 million from fy2014, mainly due to its large us dollar debt exposure. as for kulim malaysia bhd, the company paid a special dividend of rm500 million in 1q2015 instead of an interim dividend like in 2014. this came about after it disposed of new britain palm oil ltd to sime darby. having completed its capital reduction and repayment exercise on july 5, kulim is in the process of being taken private by controlling shareholder johor corp. over at digi.com bhd, the dividend cut reflects its lower profitability due to intensifying competition and the fact that it has been paying out close to 100% of its profits in the past three years. as maxis bhd has so far maintained its profitability relatively well, the dividend cut last year was because it lowered its dividend payout ratio to below 100% and stopped borrowing to pay dividends. shares of maxis and digi have been recovering since may, partly due to decent yields  3.3% for maxis and 4.3% for digi. nonetheless, with competitive pressures limiting growth opportunities (for example, telekom malaysia bhds (tm) new 4g lte mobile service webe) and the upcoming spectrum reallocation exercise, dividend upside for this sector seems limited and there is a possibility of further dividend cuts due to either spectrum fees or lower profitability.  higher dividends by glcs sectors that paid higher dividends contributed rm1.5 billion more in the first quarter, mostly led by individual companies (see chart 3 and table 2). tm, misc bhd, petronas chemicals group bhd, petronas gas bhd  government-linked companies (glcs) with a dominant industry position or strong parentage backing  accounted for over 60% of the amount. however, at a closer look, things are not exactly rosy. for tm, the rm455 million paid out in 1q2016 was due to a change in the timing of dividend payments. the integrated telecoms service provider, which is 28.6%-owned by khazanah nasional bhd, changed the dividend type of its second payout for fy2015 from final to second interim dividend, accelerating its dividend payment by two to three months to 1q2016. misc, which is 62.7%-owned by petroliam nasional bhd (petronas), raised its dividend payout ratio from 10.7% in 2013 to 54.3% last year. the shipping company paid out rm401.7 million in 2014 and 50% more last year, although earnings grew only 12% in the same period. in 1h2016, dividends rose to rm1 billion, 66.7% higher than that of last year. the higher dividends could be attributed to the disposal of its international tank terminal business, vtti bv, for rm3.4 billion in 4q2015 as part of its initiative to hive off uncompetitive non-core businesses. misc is currently divesting its logistics arm, misc integrated logistics sdn bhd, which is expected to bring about rm358 million in total proceeds. the stock took a dive in late april from rm8.90 to a one-year low of rm7.25 on may 9, following consensus earnings cut due to the weaker outlook for petroleum and liquefied natural gas shipping rates. data compiled by bloomberg shows that the street expects miscs operating profit to decline 21% this year, with a lower yield of 2.9%. another petronas subsidiary that paid higher dividends is petronas chemicals. it paid 25% or rm160 million more in the first quarter. as the petrochemical company has been paying out about 50% of its profits, the bigger payout was because of improved profitability last year. despite a 7.3% drop in revenue due to lower crude oil prices, net profit rose 12.9% year on year to rm2.8 billion, thanks to a higher plant utilisation rate of 85% and weaker ringgit. supported by its strong cash flow generation, petronas chemicals is expanding its capacity over the next few years through the sabah ammonia urea project and the refinery and petrochemical integrated development project in johor. taking the multi-year capacity expansion plan into account, analysts are forecasting 10.2% earnings growth for the company next year. other non-glcs that paid higher dividends in 1q2016 include property investment company selangor properties bhd, brewer heineken malaysia bhd, hong leong bank bhd and hard disk drive component maker jcy international bhd. both selangor properties and jcy incurred a loss in the latest quarter, largely due to foreign exchange losses on overseas investments and receivables/hedging instruments. mounting dividend risk with declining profits while companies could liquidate assets or borrow to pay dividends, the ability to sustain and grow dividends is still driven by profitability. as shown in chart 4, corporate profits in the past five quarters have been particularly impacted by rising operating costs as well as ringgit volatility, which led to foreign exchange losses and higher import costs. despite the declining earnings from 1q2015 to 4q2015, listed companies have been paying a similar level of dividends throughout the year, resulting in a jump in dividend payout ratio from 53% in 1q2015 to 72% in 4q2015. as this practice is not sustainable, 1q2016 saw a reduction in dividends. nevertheless, as some companies may not pay dividends in the first quarter, the 1q2016 dividend data may not be complete and sufficient enough to identify sectors or firms that have been growing their dividends. hence, we have also compiled a list of the top 50 companies that have paid higher dividends (in absolute value) in the past five years (see table 3 on page 68). many of these dividend growers have unique competitive strengths to capture the growth of their respective industry. that said, past performance is by no means indicative of future results and certain companies like digi and sime darby have reduced their dividends due to new industry developments. as dividends include proceeds from asset disposals, an increased payout could indicate a business restructuring or change in business model and, thus, may warrant a closer look. for example, both misc and rce capital bhd paid out much higher dividends last year as a result of initiatives to focus on their core business or to achieve a more efficient capital structure."}, "66": {"date_posted": "9/8/2016", "title":

utilities sector\nmaintain overweight rating: what often stops investors from buying a seemingly undervalued stock is the fear that its price will go even lower. in this report, we argue that in the long run, utility stocks with cheap valuations offer higher returns to investors than those with rich valuations. our analyses show that the stocks with relatively cheaper valuations  tenaga nasional

only nine to 16 times calendar year 2017 forecast (cy17f) price-earnings ratio (per). secondly, those with historically stable and predictable earnings, such as petronas gas, malakoff and gas malaysia, trade at steep valuation levels of 17 to 24 times cy17f per. our analyses show that the valuations of stocks in the former camp will still be on par, if not cheaper, than those of stocks in the latter camp even if all the key earnings risks of the former materialise. this, coupled with the probability that the earnings risks may never happen, means that the former group offers far superior risk-reward than the latter. on top of that, tnb, ytl power and cypark have stronger earnings growth prospects than petronas gas, malakoff and gas malaysia. companies in the former camp, in our opinion, operate in an environment where there is an abundance of horizontal expansion opportunities. we believe cheap utility stocks could react more strongly to positive news than to negative news as positive news gives the market a reason to buy the stocks, while the impact of negative news is buffered by their already-cheap valuations. tnb remains our top pick for the sector as its valuation is not only relatively cheaper, it also has a strong potential near-term rerating catalyst. tnb currently trades at only 10.8 times cy17f per and may raise its dividend payout as part of its initiative to optimise its capital structure.  cimb research, july 13"}, "68": {"date_posted": "13/7/2016", "title": "mutual cessation for berantai rsc neutral for sapurakencana", "article": " this

2012. this is the second cessation of an rsc, the first being dialog group bhd-rocoils balai project earlier this year. the cessation of the rsc, which contributed rm100 million of group net profit in fy16, will be effective on sept 30, 2016, which means that this project will continue to contribute as usual to sapurakencanas 2qfy17 earnings. as petronas will reimburse all outstanding capital and operational expenditures to the contractors by june 2017, we do not expect any loss on this development. the ownership of berantai floating, production, storage and offloading (fpso) will be transferred to petronas, which has announced that the cessation will minimise the projects long-term value erosion, and optimise the development and production activities in malaysia, in line with its efforts to reduce costs and increase the efficiency of its operations. in our opinion, the low-oil price regime has forced petronas to redeploy its assets in a more clustered approach to tap the surrounding areas network of shared resources. the berantai development, which is a wellhead platform connected to berantai fpso while gas is exported by a 30km subsea pipeline to the petronas carigali-operated angsi field, is located 150km off terengganu, 10km south of the tapis field and 30km north-east of the angsi field. recall that the projects capital expenditure (capex) had reached

believed, icon offshore bhds prospects are bright and the company is likely to play a key role in the consolidation of the offshore support vessel (osv) segment of the oil and gas (o&g) sector. he says icon will expand its operations regionally, become a market leader in the osv space and even possibly expand into new asset classes to support the o&g segment. definitely a regional play. it is never enough to look only at the home base, he says. while amir paints a pretty picture of the companys prospects, icon just announced its second consecutive quarterly loss late last month. it suffered a net loss of rm5 million on revenue of rm51.83 million for the quarter ended march. for the final quarter of fy2015, net losses were rm376.89 million on rm65.3 million in revenue.    as at end-march this year, icon had rm35.85 million in cash. its long-term debt amounted to rm501.47 million and short-term borrowings rm163.16 million. its accumulated losses stood at rm188.09 million.  a saving grace for icon could be its strong controlling shareholder. ekuiti nasional bhd, the state-controlled private equity (pe) firm, controls 42.57% of icons stock. other substantial shareholders include lembaga tabung haji with 8.43% equity interest.   on whether or not the o&g industry has bottomed out, amir says, well, i think there have been some good signs. when i joined the company in march, in the first quarter of the financial year, we saw the oil price at its lowest point of us$27 per barrel. by april, [oil was at] us$40 and now it is in the us$50s. the industry is reacting now, in the sense that, maybe the market has bottomed out a bit, he says. singing the same tune as amir, maybank investment banks t j liaw says in a report on icon late last month, we expect improved 2q16 earnings on higher asset utilisation. the osv market remains challenging but is in its trough. icon aims to be resilient in such times and targets to be ahead in m&a activity, when opportunity arises. its m&a prospect is a key standout, a rerating catalyst once it crystalises. he has a buy call based on valuations and m&a perspectives, ahead of a cyclical recovery. and he says his target price of 42 sen is based on one times enterprise value over replacement value. in early may, icon announced a rm42 million contract from exxonmobil exploration and production malaysia inc for the supply of two straight supply vessels for two years with an option for a year-long extension. liaw adds that with the two new contracts secured last month, icons utilisation rate of its vessels in the second quarter of the year will be above the break-even 50%, and more than the 45% it reached in the first quarter. maybank assumes an overall osv utilisation rate of 53% for this year and 65% for 2017, which would indicate that the worst is over for icon. while icon may bag new jobs and increase its utilisation rate, daily charter rates of osvs remain depressed, which could continue to weigh on its earnings. spot market and long-term charter rates have fallen considerably to us$1 to us$1.10 per bhp per day from us$1.20 a year ago.   nevertheless, maybank forecasts that icon will turn the corner and register a net profit of rm6.8 million for the current financial year, on the back of revenue of rm254.6 million. in fy2017 the bank-backed research outfit has icons net profit pegged at rm27.4 million from rm327.1 million in sales.     interestingly, liaw refers to icon as an m&a hotbed and cites amirs association with petroliam nasional bhd (where he had worked from 2000 until recently), the oil companys call for consolidation and ekuinas role as a pe investor, as among the factors for its positive outlook.  however, he says, size matters, after all, but it needs to be complemented with returns and profitability.  we will build a brand new industry amir hamzah azizan has been in the oil and gas (o&g) industry for 27 years. earlier this year, he left petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) to become managing director of icon offshore bhd, a company controlled by ekuiti nasional bhd (ekuinas). the move caught many by surprise. in a candid interview with the edge, amir explained the move and shares his views on the local o&g industry. here are excerpts.  the edge: why did you join icon? amir hamzah azizan: to be fair, i was very comfortable and enjoying myself in petronas, i was still in the midst of running the lubricant business. theres never a time when someone thinks that he has reached a point and say, im done, theres nothing left for me to do here, because theres always something to do. and here comes ekuinas, which says, would you now come and join us? the reality is that it (icon) has potential. it is going to face a lot of headwinds because we have seen the oil price move the way it has ... what better time for you to shape the industry?  you talk about consolidation. is there any mandate to consolidate the o&g industry, or is it your own direction for the company? when you talk about a mandate, what do we mean by that? does it mean the government tells me, i direct you to do it? theres no such thing. we will build a brand new industry for malaysia and thats an interesting proposition. not saying that its easy u2026 its difficult, but ive got quite a supportive shareholder.  you hope for icon to lead the consolidation. do you see any room for entrepreneurs to be involved in running the company?  i think its possible. i dont think organisations can run without some sense of entrepreneurship. the entrepreneurial spirit must be there.  would consolidation entail icon having the whole spectrum for offshore support vessel (osv) services? i think today, consolidation play is very useful because most of the players are quite subscale at this point. scale gives you the ability to have a wider range of vessels, more resources to introduce better systems and processes and all the good things that come with scale. but scale also creates challenges. you must be good in management u2026 a lot of moving parts.  will icon move from predominantly shallow water osvs? it is within our scope to look at, but in order for me to make the next leap, i have got to be sure i can integrate and hold the process well.  isnt the recent increase in oil price to us$50 a dampener for the consolidation? well, at us$50 oil, i dont think anybody is rolling in money. so the logic for consolidation is still there because at the end of the day, instinct tells you that you have to get bigger because you need to be able to support the majors in a different playing field. when you had the majors all operating at us$100 oil, you had the rich mans disease, right? when youre rich, you drop a dollar, you drop fifty cents, you dont pick it up u2026 you just walk away, its too much of a problem picking it up right? when you are a poor man, you will dig wherever you are, looking for pennies u2026 even in cracks. thats where we are. i think everybody whom we have broached the idea to would like to consider it ... but i wont say we are in detailed negotiations or anything of the like, but at least i have the alignment. no one has come back and told me its stupid (to consolidate).  so where does petronas come in? it can create an environment to help. im not saying petronas is going be asked to put in unreasonable catalysts. theres enough competition to keep everybody honest. but at least for the people who combine and do something  offer (them) a longer-term contract. that allows them to fund the business better and gives them stability.  what is your definition of scale? for the first phase, maybe call it the next two or three years, getting to a level of 50 to 80 ships. it will mean you have to have a base fleet here, but it will also offer you enough excess to play significantly in other regional markets that you want.

while the s&p 500 index inched down 3.82 points to end at 2,071.5. the fbm klci plunged despite a narrower range of 20.8 points traded for the week with sluggish volumes of 1.46 billion to 1.56

oil & gas corp bhd\n(june 3, 95 sen)\nmaintain hold with an unchanged fair value (fv) of 80 sen: our rating and fv for umw oil & gas corp bhd (umwog) are based on the groups financial year ending dec 31, 2016 forecast (fy16f) book value, with a 20% discount to its rig costs. our fy16f to fy18f losses are maintained, which have already incorporated additional earnings from naga 6 contract, assuming a daily charter rate of us$75,000 (rm306,000) and a commencement date in the fourth quarter (4qfy16). recall that umwog recently secured a conditional charter contract for its naga 6 jack-up rig from petronas carigali sdn bhd for two years, with an extension for another year. umw holdings bhd, which owns 55.7% of umwog, has extended an rm308 million inter-company loan for umwogs working capital requirements. the loan interest rate is set at the six-month kuala lumpur interbank offered rate of +1.75% per annum, with a repayment period of five years. this is a positive development, which highlights umws parental support for umwog, which has to resolve its rm2.1 billion debt due for repayment soon. however, this is only a temporary band-aid, as the inter-company loan represents only 15% of the refinancing requirements. umwogs 1qfy16 negative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of rm5 million indicated that the coming months may be worse, given that the majority of its assets are currently not being utilised or secured by a long-term charter. as such, we expect negotiations with financial institutions for umwogs existing debt to include some form of corporate guarantee from its parent, which requires shareholder approval. we also do not discount the possibility of a dilutive debt restructuring exercise, which may involve an equity-raising scheme. currently, only two of the groups eight rigs are in operation: the semi-submersible naga 1 and jack-up rig naga 7. however, naga 7s charter will expire next month, which means that only one rig will be in operation from july to october, when the naga 8 jack-up rig will recommence operation together with naga 6, which has just secured the petronas carigali contract. the outlook for umwog, which derives most of its revenue from drilling rigs, remains challenging in the near to medium term, as a slowdown in the sector maintains downward pressure on day rates, which are exacerbated by an influx of uncontracted newbuilds. hence, the stock currently trades at a 32% discount to its latest book value of rm1.39 per share, which could be eroded by further losses.  aminvestment research, june 3"}, "77": {"date_posted": "1/6/2016", "title": "trade wise: petronas chemicals not slowing down, charts future growth in rapid project", "article": "  this article first appeared in corporate, the edge malaysia weekly, on may 16 - 22, 2016. petronas chemicals group bhd (petchem), which had a weak start to the year as first-quarter net profit slipped 2% from a year earlier, has no plans to slow down anytime soon. after putting its house in order over the last two years, the group is all set to ramp up capacity and feedstock supply reliability in order to increase its share of the market and fend off incoming competition, especially from the middle east. besides the sabah ammonia and urea (samur) plant in sipitang, sabah, which will provide an additional 1.2 million tonnes per year of granulated urea once commissioned by year-end, petchem is spending us$2.7 billion (rm10.8 billion) to build four petrochemical plants in pengerang, johor. it currently produces 1.4 million tonnes of granulated urea a year. so far, the group has awarded four contracts worth a combined us$1.36 billion to two consortia to build the four polyethylene and glycol processing plants in the us$27 billion refinery and petrochemical integrated development (rapid) project. but, considering the adverse conditions in the oil and gas (o&g) market, is it a good time to make such huge investment now? petchem managing director and ceo datuk sazali hamzah tells the edge in an interview last monday that the groups investment in rapid is not just another capacity expansion decision by the group. the project will not only make petchem the largest producer of polyethylene and glycol in the region, but will also pave the way for a future without natural gas  a commodity that is in critical shortage in the country. why is rapid a good project for us? first, our gas capacity is already at its peak. gas supply [from petronas] can only be sustained at our current capacity for the next 20 years. to grow our gas-based petrochemical productions, the supply would not be enough, sazali says. we can grow a little bit here and there, but not in a big way. thus, we have to start using naphtha [as feedstock]. naphtha is usually a by-product of oil refining. it can also be refined from coal, tar and shale oil. and now is the best time for us to compete in the naphtha area as we still have the advantage of having big margins in our gas-based business. according to sazali, about 30% of petrochemical players in the world are gas-based producers, with petchem being one of the largest. it is worth noting that gas-based players, especially those subsidised by governments or quasi-government entities such as petroliam nasional bhd (petronas), enjoy better margins than naphtha-based producers. while malaysia is blessed with abundant natural gas reserves, most of the proven reserves have been pledged to north asian countries on long-term contracts. petronas has even ventured into british columbia in canada to secure gas supply for future requirements. despite the depleting gas reserves, petronas is still committed to supporting petchems growth as a gas-based petrochemical producer. sazali says the group recently finalised a new gas supply agreement with its parent company, petronas, before the current 20-year contract expires this september. apart from the ability to start a naphtha-based petrochemical plant, the investment in four plants in rapid will increase petchems capacity by half once they are up and running by late 2019 or early 2020, says sazali. with the projects in rapid, naphtha-based petrochemicals will constitute 30% of our production capacity. we would be much more robust than those players that are 100% naphtha-based producers, while on the gas-based side, nobody can be as big as us in this region, says sazali. the o&g industry has been facing one of the worst downward cycles in history over the last 2u00bd years, with crude oil prices plunging from above us$110 per barrel in june 2014 to us$28 per barrel in january this year. last friday, international brent crude futures were trading at us$47.66 per barrel. while acknowledging that nobody can tell what the demand for petroleum and petrochemical products is going to be like over the next five years, sazali says that, based on his past experience, there should be at least two upward cycles in the o&g industry over a 20-year period. for a petrochemical project, one upward cycle is enough to recover the initial capital outlay, says sazali, speaking from his experience during the construction of the kerteh integrated petrochemical complex (kipc) in terengganu in the early 1990s. it was the same scenario during that time. i was involved in the development of the aromatics complex in kipc. people were asking why we were spending rm2 billion  a huge amount at that time  on these two plants. when we first ran the aromatics operation, the price was at the lowest margin. we built big plants with low margins but two years after that, the market picked up quickly. so, if we had not followed our discipline along the way back then, we would not be able to enjoy the benefits now, says sazali. he adds that demand for petrochemical products is growing, especially in a region where 50% of the population is forecast to reach middle income level by 2030. today, southeast asia has a population of 620 million. to fulfil the growing demand for petroleum and petrochemical products, sazali estimates that there is a need for eight integrated refinery and petrochemical complexes the size of rapid in the region. to illustrate the high demand for petrochemical products in this region, sazali says up to 70% of samurs capacity has been committed to customers so far, although demand for the products could take up the entire annual capacity of the plant. petchems balance sheet is still healthy, with cash and cash equivalents of rm8.57 billion and only rm15 million in borrowings as at march 31 this year. the group generated rm891 million in cash from operations in the first quarter ended march 31 (1qfy2016). while the investments in rapid will require petchem to utilise its cash hoard and take up borrowings, sazali assures that the groups dividend payout policy of 50% of earnings will not be affected. in 1qfy2016, petchem posted a lower net profit of rm592 million compared with rm605 million a year ago, while revenue slipped 0.2% to rm3.15 billion from rm3.14 billion previously. however, during the quarter, petchems plant utilisation across the group reached its highest level since listing, at 92%, compared with 90% in 1qfy2015. its olefins and derivatives business recorded plant utilisation of 97% during the period, while fertilisers and methanol was 89%. petchems share price has been on a steady increase over the last one year, adding 7.7% over the period to rm6.45 last thursday. between aug 24, 2015, and jan 8, 2016, petchems share price rose 40.3% to rm7.74. last friday, the counter closed at rm6.20, 16.7% off its 52-week peak. analysts are quite bullish about the groups prospects. maybank investment bank research has a target price of rm7.80 on petchem

the company is not expanding [its petrol station count] as aggressively anymore and the business has a strong correlation to economic growth, which as we know is expected to grow at a slower rate this year, ang told the edge financial daily over the phone last friday. a ta securities note earlier this month said petronas dagangan had reduced its target of annual petrol station additions to a range of 20 to 30 this year. before, its target was up to 40. the research houses target price of rm18.55 on petronas dagangan is one of the lowest among eight analysts covering the group. however, that target price was based on 21 times projected earnings per share (eps) for the financial year ending dec 31, 2016 (fy16), when the stock has been trading at nearly 30 times. alliancedbs research, meanwhile, pegs petronas dagangan at 28 times its estimated per, which analyst inani rozidin said is the five-year mean historical ratio. kenanga investment bank, the only research house that gives petronas dagangan an outperform rating, has a target price of rm25.40, which is 27 times the projected eps of 94 sen in fy17. bloomberg data showed analysts project petronas dagangan to make a net rm873.7 million in fy16, 10.6% higher than last years rm789.98 million. on a per share basis, its fy16 earnings would be 88 sen. while the analysts average target price is rm22.10, if one were to use the historical five-year earnings valuation of 28 times earnings, petronas dagangan could be valued at rm24.64 per share. in the first financial quarter ended march 31, 2016, its net profit grew by 6.63% year-on-year to rm219.402 million. its growth was stunted by a 6.2% drop in the commercial segments operating profit to rm133.62 million, as there was lower demand for diesel from petronas exploration and production companies, and fishery sectors. the retail segments operating profit meanwhile was up by 12.28% to rm154.29 million, thanks to a healthy growth in its other income. alliancedbs inani, in her may 12 note, highlighted the risk of petronas dagangan making inventory losses if oil prices continue to drop. as the group holds one to two weeks worth of inventories and malaysias petrol pumps adjust their prices only once a month, falling petrol prices in the future would lead to margin compression when they were purchased at higher prices previously. another analyst said that crude oil prices stabilising currently at the us$45 (rm184)-to-us$50 level per barrel bodes well for petronas dagangan. while the group is competing in a volume game, removing the oil price volatility will bring security to its margin, said the analyst. since april, spot brent crude has gone up by 25.23% to us$49.59 a barrel last thursday. malaysias ron 95 and ron 97 meanwhile have gone up by 10 sen since march, and diesel by 20 sen."}, "80": {"date_posted": "23/5/2016", "title": "dnex rises 10% after securing petronas contract", "article": " kuala lumpur (may 23): dagang nexchange bhd (dnex) rose as much as 2.5 sen or 10% to 27.5 sen today, following news that the group has bagged a drilling equipment and services contract from petronas carigali sdn bhd. the e-commerce service provider was one of the most actively traded stocks today, with more than 12.09 million shares changed hands. at 3.03pm, the counter pared some of its gains and was two sen or 8% higher at 27 sen. the current price gives it a market capitalisation of rm205.44 million. the counter has risen about 22.73% from 22 sen on may 13. last friday (may 20), the company announced to bursa malaysia that its 80%-owned subsidiary, dnex oilfield services sdn bhd, had received a letter of award from petronas carigali for the said contract. dnex, however, did not state the value of the three-year contract in its announcement. it merely said the job is expected to contribute positively to its future earnings and net assets. the contract, to be effective from april 28 this year to april 27, 2019, carries a one-year extension option for petronas.

civil engineering works. it also manufactures and sells reinforced concrete piles, as well as provides earthwork contractor services. a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that three research houses cover this stock, with a buy, a hold and a sell call each. maybank investment bank bhd does not cover naim on a fundamental basis. naims chart trend on the daily, weekly and and monthly time

broke above their recent key critical support levels of rm2.24 and rm2.42, look to sell naim on any rallies to its resistance areas, as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term downtrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, oscillator and stochastic) have issued clear sell signals and now show firm and obvious indications of

2016 (4qfy16) jump 232.65% to rm5.08 million from rm1.53 million a year ago. this follows a 12.09% rise in revenue to rm61.1 million from rm54.5 million in 4qfy15, the group said in a filing with bursa malaysia today. for the financial year ended jan 31 (fy16), net profit dipped 6.44% to rm7.71 million from rm8.24 million in fy15, while revenue fell 3.6% to rm224.3 million from rm232.7 million. the drop in revenue was mainly due to lower domestic volume for certain models, said sapura industrial. moving ahead, the group said the total industry volume for 2016 is projected at 650,000 motor vehicles amidst uncertain economic factors, which have led to a subdued business environment and moderation in consumers' spending. crescendo corp bhd's net profit plunged 90.4% to rm3.3 million or 1.43 sen per share in the fourth financial quarter ended jan 31, 2016 (4qfy16), from rm34.4 million or 15.12 sen per share a year earlier, due to lower property sales. aside from lower property sales this year, the group said it had recorded a realised gain from the transfer of property development to investment properties, amounting to rm23.3 million, and a gain from fair value adjustment on investment properties, amounting to rm7.4 million in the previous year. stripping out those gains, its profit before tax for 4qfy16 was 54% lower at rm7.6 million, as compared to rm16.5 million, it

the 12-month period to jan 31, 2016 (fy16), net profit fell 10% to rm221.99 million or 20.8 sen a share from rm247.68 million or 26.06 sen a share a year ago, in line with a 10% decline in revenue to rm975.53 million in fy16 from rm1.083 billion in fy15. the integrated offshore production and support services provider told bursa that its results were lower for fy16 due to the recognition of a gain on disposal of subsidiary and joint venture of rm20.87 million and a fair value gain of rm30.52 million in forward contracts in fy15. excluding the gains, the group said its other operations segment saw an increase of rm17.23 million, which was attributed to net foreign exchange difference of about rm52 million, but was offset by impairment of available-for-sale financial assets of rm17.55 million and realised loss on derivatives of rm8.15 million. sona petroleum bhd, which is in the midst of securing its qualifying asset, has adjourned its extraordinary general meeting (egm) after shareholders said they were unclear about the company's proposed rm80 million capital repayment. the capital repayment hinges on the success of sona's planned acquisition of the stag oilfield in

acquisition of the stag oilfield for us$25 million (about rm99 million). \"we have just finished our egm and the decision is to adjourn the egm. we will have another within one month. we hope to

consecutive quarters, since the second quarter ended june 30, 2014 (2qfy14). annual net loss for fy15 narrowed to rm16.5 million, from rm26.64 million in fy14, mainly due to cheaper raw materials. revenue was 8.6% weaker at rm491.63 million, from rm537.69 million in fy14, due to weaker market and lower demand of its products. perdana petroleum bhd, which proposed the acquisition of two barges for us$84 million (rm330 million) last june, has decided to cancel its order for one of them due to the poor market conditions in the o&g industry. the company said it has so far not identified any

likely for o&g", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on january 4 - january 10, 2016.  for a world that is addicted to oil, an abundant supply of the black gold seems to have caused a lot of anxiety. oil traders, analysts, stock market enthusiasts and government economists have spent the best part of 2015 crunching numbers, keeping an eye on regional geopolitical developments and anticipating volatile crude oil price movements in order to avoid placing the wrong bets on oil. brent crude lost 35.3% in 2015 and hit its lowest price for the year at us$36.1 per barrel, sending chills down the spines of market observers. so, the question of how low crude oil prices can go must seem old by now. yet, for those who are still looking to wager on the beaten sector, recent developments in the oil market show investors could be in for another rough ride in 2016. in september 2015, us investment bank goldman sachs, and more recently the international monetary fund, warned that crude prices could plummet to as low as us$20 a barrel in 2016 on the back of a persistent glut. with the possibility of iran, which owns the worlds fourth largest oil reserves, pumping more after western powers lift sanctions, the us congress lifting a 40-year ban on crude exports and the organization of the petroleum exporting countries (opec) continues playing hardball over scaling down production, it is reasonable to expect the market to be flooded with cheap oil next year. local analysts, however, tell the edge that the forecast may be overbearish. midf research analyst aaron tan says, the main issue with the oil price is not just oversupply, but deliberate oversupply. so, when you talk about the oil price, you have to consider two factors  the asset break-even point, which is the point at which a particular oil asset can generate positive cash flow, and the fiscal break-even point at which the minimum sale price for a barrel of oil for a country to reach a budget surplus. after a certain point of decline, low prices become unsustainable. deliberate oversupply by opec in its relentless drive to knock out shale competition will eventually have to end, he says. opec has an unofficial production ceiling of 30 million barrels per day (bpd), but is producing 32 million bpd. opec can still ramp up production to 36 million bpd, but the strain of overproducing in a climate of low prices is starting to show. saudi arabia has unveiled cuts to government expenditure, raised taxes and slashed fuel subsidies to cope. bahrain has approved measures to cut state spending by 30% to weather the oil storm. the emir of kuwait has pressed parliament to implement similar fiscal reforms. even the oil cartel itself is reportedly tightening its belt by reducing expenditure on travel and freezing recruitment at its headquarters in vienna. the same is being done by non-opec countries like malaysia. further, worries over us oil flowing into the open market may also be overplayed. us shale oil is heavy and has a higher sulphur content than its competitors. a higher api gravity of shale means many refineries in the world are still unable to process it. even if you want to export us crude, you need to have offtakers. globally, not many refineries can process heavy oil. to do that, you have to recalibrate your facilities and that can take six months to a year, tan says. taking these factors into consideration, he says the chances of oil prices reaching us$20 per barrel and staying there is very unlikely. i expect prices to rebound in the second half of 2016, and oil to trade around us$50 per barrel. that, though, is not to say there is nothing to worry about for investors looking to put their money in oil and gas stocks. analysts say even as oil prices recover in 2016, corporate earnings for oil-related stocks are expected to come under more pressure, the value of contracts to be awarded next year to shrink and an increasing number of impairments and assets and revision of prices of tendered projects. such a prognosis makes even cherry-picking stocks difficult. however, kenanga research analyst sean lim says although catalysts for a rally in oil and gas stocks will be hard to come by, opportunities can still be found in companies whose share prices have been beaten down during the oil price collapse. icon offshore bhd and sapurakencana petroleum bhd are two companies that have suffered in 2015 due to their share prices. in a sense, their prices already bottomed out during the global stock market rout in august and have stopped reacting wildly to crude oil price volatility. the plus side here is that these stocks should rally when there is a sustained recovery in oil prices, says lim. longer-term recommendations for the sector include companies that have a resilient cash flow to weather the weakness in crude oil prices. yinson holdings bhd, which is expected to secure at least another floating production storage and offloading contract, and dialog group bhd, which has petroliam nasional bhds refinery and petrochemical integrated development project in pengerang to back its earnings, are safe longer-term options, says lim. tan says the downstream subsegment is also expected to remain robust and relatively insulated from crude oil price troubles. his stock picks include petronas chemicals bhd, which has announced three petrochemical projects within the pengerang integrated petroleum complex, and knm group bhd, which stands to be a beneficiary of the supply of specialised process equipment. for investors seeking exposure to a more predictable downstream company offering stable earnings, he recommends gas malaysia bhd, as the adoption of the incentive-based regulation

since its listing on bursa malaysia in june 2014. some may blame it on the bad timing of the initial public offer by its controlling shareholder ekuiti nasional bhd (ekuinas). its share price tanked shortly after the debut and shed 80.5% from rm1.85 in june 2014 to 36 sen last tuesday  barely one-fifth of the ipo price of rm1.85. those who have a long-term view on the stock seem to think that the share price has reached the floor, barring any unforeseen circumstances. this nascent optimism stems from the fact that the company has seen signs of improvement operationally in its third quarter ended sept 30, 2015 (3qfy2015). for one, the utilisation rate of its vessels improved to 61% from 58% in the previous quarter, albeit still lower than 79% a year ago. meanwhile, its tender success rate also improved to 45%, compared with 33% in the previous quarter.   icon offshore chalked up net profit of rm5.53 million in 3qfy2015, an improvement from rm4.57 million in 2qfy2015 but still far less than the rm18.95 million recorded in 3qfy2014. more importantly, it has a new management. oil and gas industry veteran amir hamzah azizan will take over the helm as managing director effective march 1 next year. amir, son of the late petronas ceo tan sri azizan zainul abidin, will be leaving the national oil company. he is currently ceo of petronas lubricants international. he was also at the helm of petronas dagangan bhd and misc bhd previously. his appointment is expected to boost investor confidence, says maybank investment research. in addition, captain hassan ali has been appointed chief operating officer while ekuinas ceo datuk abdul rahman ahmad has been redesignated to executive director from non-executive director previously. ekuinas has the lions share in icon offshore, holding a 48.5% stake through its vehicles hallmark odyssey sdn bhd and sempena fokus sdn bhd. the change in management will definitely help. before this, it felt as though there was not really anyone in charge of things, comments an analyst. shortly after its debut, icon offshore was hit hard by the plunge in global crude oil prices from the peak of us$115 per barrel. by january this year, crude oil prices had more than halved to us$46.59 per barrel. early this month, they were at around us$36. as if the weakness in crude oil prices wasnt bad enough, icon offshore suffered another blow in april when its then ceo dr jamal yusof and coo rahman yusof were sought by the malaysian anti-corruption commission to assist in investigations. until today, the nature of their involvement in the investigations has not been disclosed, but both men have resigned from the company. the company also had to deal with rumours of falsification of its bollard pull certificates for some of its vessels. it has denied all allegations. however, the future looks brighter. maybank research says in a recent report that icon offshore has outperformed its peers in terms of cost management, noting that its osv peers are in the red despite operating at higher utilisation levels. icons ability to cost-down effectively and in a timely manner is commendable, with management having placed emphasis on fuel consumption optimisation, overhead cuts and savings from proactive vessel lay-ups and minimal safe manning, where possible, says maybank research. an analyst says petronas preference for malaysian vessel owners will help companies like icon offshore. in fact, maybank research mentions in its report that the company had secured two charter wins in the third quarter and another three jobs in the fourth quarter at a time when its peers were being hit by early termination of contracts. but with crude oil prices hovering around us$40 per barrel, petronas is having a hard time too. i think they will not be able to assist much unless oil prices rebound. that will be a catalyst for icon, opines the analyst. looking at icon offshores balance sheet, short-term borrowings at rm158.76 million is more than five times the amount of cash available at rm29.78 million. the companys times interest earned stands at only 1.64 times, based on its 3qfy2015 earnings. according to maybank research, icon offshores balance sheet discipline is evident from its decision to defer delivery of four new osvs and terminate the purchase of an osv asset to conserve its cash flow. the company planned to embark on a refinancing exercise, but so far, there hasnt been any firm answer on that aspect. it would be difficult to refinance during such times, when liquidity is shrinking, and i dont think banks are very keen on refinancing oil and gas companies, says an analyst. at its current share price of 36 sen apiece, icon offshore is trading at a price-earnings ratio of 4.66 times. the stock has a buy and three hold calls. only time will tell whether the new management will be able to continue turning around the company in an industry that is perceived by some to be overcrowded, at least for now.

has awarded ytl power international bhd a two-year plus 10-month extension for the 800mwpaka power station. but the company has run into more than a little resistance. the day ytl powers power purchase agreement (ppa) expired, petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) immediately cut off the gas supply to the paka power plant, as well as ytl powers 400mw plant in pasir gudang that expired on the same day. note that the paka plant has been awarded an extension for only 600mw of the total capacity. the pasir gudang plant did not get an extension. likewise, tenaga nasional bhd (tnb) disconnected both plants from the grid, according to industry sources. this means that in the event of a power shortage, the national grid would not be able to draw on some 1,200mw worth of power controlled by ytl power. at the same time, both government-linked companies (glcs) have been giving ytl power (fundamental: 1.50; valuation: 1.40) a tough time in finalising the ppa extension for the paka plant. according to the industry sources, petronas has been delaying the signing of the new gas supply agreement (gsa), which is critical for the new ppa. it is worth noting that ytl power is suing petronas for an estimated rm700 million in overpayments for gas supplied. in a written reply, petronas tells the edge, the gsa between petronas and ytl power came to an end on sept 30, 2015. a new gsa has yet to be entered into. as with any commercial arrangement, the terms of the agreement will have to be agreed to by both parties and are subject to the approval of both parties management. at the same time, tnb has also not signed the ppa, saying that ytl power needs to first sign a new land lease agreement (lla) for the land on which the paka power plant stands. the land is owned by the utility. however, the government has already intervened, hoping to resolve the impasse, say sources. following mediations between the conflicting parties last month, the ministry of energy, green technology and water instructed petronas to sign the gsa and tnb the ppa. but the glcs have yet to sign on the dotted line. is petronas obliged tosupply gas? on one hand, it can be argued that petronas is obliged to supply gas to ytl power since it holds a monopoly on gas in the country. but if that is the case, why did the ministry need to intervene? applying the competition act 2010 should have resolved the issue. some might argue that petronas does not monopolise the countrys gas supply, since the regasification terminal in melaka has open access, allowing for the import of liquefied natural gas (lng) by third parties. although it hasnt been done yet, ytl power could theoretically import its own lng. even if it were more expensive, any increment on fuel costs will be passed on to tnb. however, industry players say such an arrangement would be impractical and not commercially viable simply because lng would be supplied on a take or pay basis while the ppa with tnb is not. it would make more sense for the stakeholders involved for petronas to supply the gas. the question is  why is it holding back on the gsa? petronas views the arbitration matter and the new gsa as two separate and distinct matters, the state oil firm stressed when asked on the matter. but with such a large sum  rm700 million  at stake, observers say petronas could be holding back on signing the gsa as leverage. recall that earlier this year, petronas sought to arbitrate the matter with ytl power in london. it was reported that evidential hearings since march had ruled in favour of ytl power. in brief, petronas had a contract to supply gas to ytl power for its two power plants at a predetermined price in 1993, but it raised prices in 1997. ytl power had to pay the excess over the years but is now suing petronas for the difference  approximately rm700 million with interest. petronas could not comment on the arbitration since it is subject to a confidentiality agreement, but tells the edge that it has filed an application to set aside the arbitration award at the kuala lumpur high court. in turn, ytl has also applied to strike out petronas application. both applications will be heard on nov 30, 2015, adds petronas.  unable to land the ppa tnb wants to sign a new lla with ytl power, despite the fact that the existing lease expires only in end-2018. and without the new lla, tnb is reluctant to enter into a ppa with ytl power. the extension for ytl powers power plant runs from march 1, 2016 to dec 31, 2018. hence, there is no need to renegotiate the lla. it is understood that the energy commission originally intended to extend ytl powers ppa until end-2019 but settled for the shorter extension to match the existing lla. ytl powers land is about 16ha but not all of it is in use. tnb wants to sign a new lla so that it can take back the unused portion, explains one source. when contacted, tnb declined to comment. it is learnt that the ministry of energy, green technology and water wrote to tnb saying that the new lla should not be a condition precedent to the signing of the ppa. but even if tnb were to sign the ppa, it would still be useless without a gsa as the ppa is conditional upon ytl power securing a gsa from petronas. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical

between 50m and 100m in the central luconia province, off sarawak, and covers about 3,460 sq km. it [new gas field development] should be good with the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons reaching equilibrium in 18 to 24 months, shahril muses. to recap, sapurakencana has a 30% stake in the gas field while petronas carigali, the exploration arm of petronas, owns 40%. the remaining 30% is held by diamond energy sarawak sdn bhd, a subsidiary of japans mitsubishi corp.  besides the 30% of the profit it should rake in, sapurakencana could also bag jobs for the development of the field. jobs will be tendered out for the project and not just us but everyone. sapurakencana will have to be competitive, shahril says. he is understandably tight-lipped, unwilling to divulge any details of the possible contracts the company is eyeing. according to the companys announcement to bursa malaysia, among the big-ticket items is a central processing platform (cpp) with a 35km gas evacuation pipeline that is tied to the existing infrastructure. sapurakencana, of course, has the expertise in both the fabrication of cpps and pipe laying. considering that the gas field is not that large, the cpp fabrication job should be worth a few hundred million us dollars while the pipe-laying contract, depending on a whole host of factors, could also come up to hundreds of millions of us dollars. should sapurakencana win any of these jobs, that would add to its rm23 billion order book, comprising largely international transport and installation, and fabrication jobs in several parts of the world, including brazil. while shahril would not comment on the likelihood of a gas sales agreement being concluded, kenanga investment banks oil and gas analyst, sean lim, says: we were guided that the gas sales agreement has a duration of 5.5 years and that the field is estimated to generate total ebitda of us$83 million (us$25 million for sapurakencanas 30% stake) per annum for the field, assuming the field is able to ramp up to full production within three to six months of the commencement of operations at current oil prices. according to lim, the field can produce 100 million standard cubic feet per day of hydrocarbon gas for petronas lngs complex in bintulu, sarawak. while the selling price of gas at the point of production in 2018 is uncertain, at present, lng is going for about us$3.60 per million british thermal units (mmbtu). sapurakencana, petronas carigali and mitsubishi are expected to split the profits after deducting the cost of production, tax and royalties, among others. an industry observer opines that with the locked-in gas sales agreement, there is limited risk for the three partners, but cautions that the earnings will only trickle in from 2018, which explains why there was no effect on sapurakencanas share price. says the oil and gas market watcher, it [field development plan approval] will only start having an impact on sapurakencanas bottom line in 2018 as first gas delivery is likely to be in the fourth quarter of 2017.  there are no earnings as yet, so there will be no impact [on the bottom line] until a few years, maybe three, from now and not many people factor in the three years ahead. she also says diversification into gas from just oil will add a new income stream to sapurakencana, which augurs well for the company. like most oil and gas players, sapurakencana has been adversely affected by soft crude oil prices, which have fallen off a high of us$110 per barrel in september 2013 to below us$50 per barrel now.  for its six months ended july 31, 2015, sapurakencana registered a net profit of rm364.8 million from revenue of rm5.1 billion. it had cash amounting to rm1.8 billion, long-term debt commitments of rm9.5 billion and short-term borrowings of rm8.4 billion. according to kenangas lim, the capital expenditure needed for the project is estimated at us$300 million, stretching up to the fourth quarter of 2017. he says sapurakencana has already secured the funding for its 30% stake, which works out to us$90 million, through multi-currency facilities. this means there is no impact on the companys gearing, which at present stands at about 1.3 times. lim maintains his market perform call on sapurakencana and has revised his target price from rm2.04 to rm2.38, valuing the group at a target price-earnings ratio of 14 times to factor in better prospects from its gas project."}, "116": {"date_posted": "25/11/2015", "title": "petronas gas awards contract to barakah", "article": " kuala

year ago as revenue shrunk, and foreign exchange (forex) losses came in higher. revenue for the quarter shrunk 43.7% to rm340.6 million, from rm605.3 million in the same quarter last year, as its performance continued to be affected by foreign steel producers' dumping activities, as the measures imposed by the authorities are generally seen as ineffective. lion corp expects the operating

last year due to lower sales volume. it declared a fourth interim dividend of three sen per share, bringing its full year's dividend to 6.75 sen versus 4.25 sen in fy14. net profit for fy15 came in

ended sept 30, 2015 (1qfy16) more than tripled to rm9.75 million or 10.77 sen per share from rm2.59 million or 2.86 sen per share driven by its property development and general construction segment. the improvement in performance was mainly contributed by a surge of 109% and 353% in progress billings and pre-tax profit respectively from property development, with much improved project margin, it said. a hike of 79% and 88% in total billings and pre-tax profit respectively from general construction has also lifted its earnings for the quarter. revenue almost doubled to rm67.13 million from rm34.13 million in 1qfy15. zelan bhd registered a 75.9% increase in net profit for the third quarter ended sept 30, 2015 (3qfy15) to rm23.45 million from rm13.33 million a year ago, largely due to a rm26 million provision write-back and a rm15.9 million tax refund. the write-back was on its provision for late payment interest charge on tax in indonesia, while the tax refund was on tax paid in indonesia. also contributing to the better results was a rm1.8 million tax refund from india, and higher unrealised forex gain of rm10.3 million, its filing on bursa today showed. revenue for the quarter rose 49.1% to rm94.03 million from rm63.1 million in 3qfy14, contributed mostly by local projects as well as the meena project in abu dhabi. for the nine-month period (9mfy15), net profit rose 34.08% y-o-y to rm49.02 million while revenue rose 48.4% to rm297.13 million. despite lower cpo prices and weaker hospital profit, tdm bhd saw its net profit for the third financial quarter ended sept

losses recorded by its associate company kapar energy ventures sdn bhd and lower finance costs, following the redemption of its sukuk from its initial public offering (ipo) proceeds. revenue for 3qfy15 fell 9.2% to rm1.28 billion, from rm1.41 billion a year ago on lower capacity factor registered by its gas-fired and coal-fired power plants and the scheduled outages taken by certain plants, as part of its maintenance requirement. the independent water and power producing company recommended an interim dividend of two sen, totalling rm100 million for the financial year ending dec 31, 2015 (fy15), payable on dec 28. for the nine-month period (9mfy15), malakoff's net profit gained 51.7% to rm346.21 million or 7.91 sen per share, from rm228.86 million or 6.39 sen per share in 9mfy14.

sept 30, 2015 (2qfy16) from rm33.99 million or 6.33 sen per share in 2qfy15. the national postal company attributed the lower earnings to the lower profits from mail and retail segments, caused by higher transportation cost for transhipment business and recognition of expired postal order in 2qfy15. however, revenue came in 7.3% higher at rm398.8 million from rm371.67 million a year ago, underpinned by its mail and retail segments, which registered an increase in turnover of 11% and 15.3% respectively during the quarter. for the first half of fy16 (1hfy16), pos malaysia posted a 57.1% decline in net profit to rm26.22 million or 4.88 sen per share from rm61.1 million or 11.38 sen per share a year ago due to the same reasons. revenue for 1hfy16 gained 6.6% to rm789.17 million from rm740.46 million in 1hfy15. going forward, pos malaysia said its revenue growth will be mainly driven by the growth in products and services related to e-commerce, namely courier, small packets and parcels products. although the e-commerce growth trend is expected to have long-term potential, it pointed out that the softening near-term economic and market sentiments are expected to be challenging for the group's prospects. property developer and theme park operator i-bhd saw its net profit for the third quarter ended sept 30, 2015 (3qfy15) fall 39.9% to rm8.56 million, from rm14.24 million a year earlier, as revenue dropped 28.65% to rm55.22 million, compared with rm77.39 million a year ago. it told bursa that its property development segment  the group's biggest revenue contributor  recorded lower sales and pre-tax profit because its ongoing developments were at their initial stages of construction. for the cumulative nine months (9mfy15), net profit fell 31.29% to rm27.31 million from last year's rm39.75 million. going forward, i-bhd expects its property development and leisure segments to continue contributing positively to its financials in fy15.

alam maritim resources bhds rm500 million sukuk ijarah medium term notes to ais from a+is., and has revised its sukuk issuance outlook to stable from negative. in a statement today, marc said the rating action affects rm115 million of outstanding sukuk issued under the rated programme. the rating downgrade was driven mainly by alam maritims weakened business risk profile arising from a tough operating environment for offshore support vessel (osv) providers. the groups operating performance has been affected by a decline in contract order book and lower charter rates for its vessels, said marc. the stable outlook reflects marcs expectation that alam maritim will sustain its current financial profile and there will be no significant reduction in the order book from the current level. marc noted that as at end-june 2015, alam maritims order book stood at rm745.5 million, about 18.6% lower from rm915.8 million as at end-2014, and charter rates have also come under pressure, with rates for existing contracts renegotiated lower by between 3% and 10% and for new contracts by up to 20%. these factors notwithstanding, marc views alam maritims established position in the osv segment, with a lengthy operating track record and sizeable fleet of 44 vessels to be supportive of the groups ability to weather the prevailing challenging conditions in the oil and gas sector, said the ratings agency. marc added that alam maritims current rating and stable outlook also factors in the groups healthier balance sheet, after it pared down its debt to rm244.3 million as at end-june 2015, from rm315.5 million a year ago, mainly through proceeds from a rights issue amounting to rm166.0 million. accordingly, the debt-to-equity (de) ratio reduced to 0.29 times as at end-june 2015, from 0.38 times at at end-2014. the groups vessel fleet accounted for over 10% of total domestic osvs as at end-2014, making alam maritim a key player in the domestic osv market. the osv segment accounted for 72% of the groups order book in the first half of 2015(1h2015), while the subsea and offshore installation and construction (oic) segment accounted for the remaining 28%, said marc. marc noted that alam maritim is expanding its subsea and oic business through the acquisition of a new diving support vessel (dsv), to replace an existing leased vessel. the new dsv will allow for overall cost savings and therefore, increase margins. the group will take delivery of the new dsv by end-2015. alam maritim remains focused on the malaysian market, with petronas carigali sdn bhd accounting for 44% of the groups total outstanding order book value. nonetheless, no major significant contracts are expected to be awarded by oil majors over the near term and contract renewals have shorter tenures of about six months, marc said. for 1h2015, alam maritims average utilisation rate fell to 57%, from 70% in 2014, in part due to the idling of three vessels which passed the maximum allowable vessel life for petronas projects, while another seven vessels were dry docked for maintenance.  the lower utilisation rate contributed to a sharp decline in operating revenue and pre-tax profit to rm153.2 million and rm19.5 million respectively in 1h2015. earnings contribution from joint ventures and associates fell to rm1.4 million in the same period, from rm19.9 million a year ago. in line with weaker profitability, cash flow from operations (cfo) declined to rm22.5 million during 1h2015, from rm78.3 million in the previous corresponding period. marc expects the group operating performance in 2h2015 to improve, following the expected completion of service work worth rm222.8 million, said the ratings agency. alam maritims share of borrowings under its associates and jointly controlled entities (jce) was lower at about rm270.4 million as at end-june 2015, from rm306.6 million a year ago, mainly due to the absence of new acquisitions since 2013.  on an adjusted basis, including borrowings under joint ventures and associates, the adjusted de declined to 0.61 times, from 0.75 times at at end 2014.. however, the adjusted de is expected to increase, given that the new us$60 million dsv is largely financed by borrowings through its 51% jce. the groups liquidity position improved to rm212.1 million as at end-2014 from proceeds of the rights issue, and this enabled alam maritim to meet the notes repayment of rm75 million under the rated programme in 1h2015.. cash balances stood at rm121.2 million as at end june 2015, which was sufficient to meet another notes repayment of rm40 million in 3q2015, the next repayment of rm40.0 million is in july 2016, said marc. marc views that demand for alam maritims services will continue to be supported by the existing production activities of the oil and gas sector. alam maritim shares were down 0.5 sen or 1.05% to 47 sen at noon market close today, with a market capitalisation of rm434.5 million.

of the petroleum exporting countries (opec) monthly oil report predicted higher crude oil demand of 30.3 million barrels per day next year, supporting the view that the pressure on declining oil prices would control the us shale boom and cut global surpluses. china and latin america have been said to contribute to slower growth next year on weaker economic outlooks. the us energy information administration also published data showing a slowdown in us oil production to 9.13 million barrels per day, which is significant and accelerating, equivalent to entire outputs of countries such as ecuador and libyas current production levels. to recap, we touched on our view of the w-shaped course in march  the crash, recover, crash, recover trend, whereby we are at the bottom part of the w. this drop could be longer than expected, considering a chain of events snowballing to this point but will eventually rebound on the back of expectations such as the international energy agencys view that non-opec production will fall by 500,000 barrels per day in 2016. we retain our overweight view on the sector, premised on our view that oil price stability seems to be in sight, assuming that supply overhang issues will eventually be erased with rising global demand and shrinking us output estimates. the iraqi government has warned oil companies about expected lower reimbursement levels due to a fall in oil sales revenue, which would reduce funds available to the oil ministry, on the back of iraq increasing production of more than four million barrels per day. issues of oil companies

more expensive for other currency holders, placing further stress on an oil price rebound. in the united states, indebted companies are increasing as traditional lending and equity markets are less willing to fund marginal companies. so, these companies are turning to private equity investors who are also on the lookout for them, but most often at steeper interest rates and demanding terms for the operators. devaluation of the yuan shook the world, even as chinese stock exchanges fell, reinforcing concerns about chinas economic health. some red flags have been raised with high levels of provincial debt, an inflated stock market and environmental pollution that could force the chinese government to loosen its reins on two decades of phenomenal growth. chinas fragile condition, coupled with evidence of a growing crude glut build-up, could serve as a dampener on oil prices. countries that depend heavily on exports to china also saw their currencies sliding. japan recorded a 1.6% annualised contraction in gross domestic product in the first half of 2015, on the back of weak domestic consumer spending and slowing exports. its weak numbers contributed to the recent sell-off as well. the indonesian government approved plans to invest us$3.7 billion (rm15.69 billion) to develop 18 oil and gas fields to offset declining production and to boost government revenue. indonesia

litigations or proceedings which may affect the formulation of the proposed corporate debt restructuring scheme. the company found it necessary to obtain the order to ensure that the creditors of the company and its subsidiaries were treated equally and efficiently. metal reclamation said the debts owed by the company and its subsidiaries to the creditors will be restructured under the scheme, which is pending the finalisation of the proposed arrangement for the scheme creditors. this is the third extension granted by the courts to metal reclamations restraining order.

talking about the possibility of crude oil prices dropping to us$30 a barrel, brent prices jumped by the most in 6u00bd years last thursday and went on to reach us$48.45 before settling at the us$47 level for the week. the 14.7% surge to that intra-week high, from its lowest in almost seven years of us$42.23 intraday on aug 24, helped malaysias bellwether fbm klci stock index gain 5.3% over four days to end the week at 1,612.74 points. while wall streets rally on renewed optimism of a us economic recovery also lifted spirits across global stock markets last week, those gains on bursa malaysia took some by surprise, as it came ahead of the aug 29 and 30 bersih 4 street rally calling for transparency and electoral reforms. the gains also came even as ratings agency moodys investors service says clouds are gathering on malaysias positive [sovereign ratings] outlook. depending on whom one asks, there are people who reckon prime minister datuk seri najib razak last week won some brownie points by bringing critics and old guard alongside academics and corporate chieftains on board his 10-man special economic committee to minimise the impact of any arising economic issues. the members include former second finance minister tan sri nor mohamed yakcop  who in 1998 helped former prime minister tun dr mahathir mohamad put in place the since rescinded ringgit peg and capital controls  and cimb group chairman datuk seri nazir razak, who has been openly critical of the current administration. will speak [the] truth to [those in] power & hope it will help [the] government to steer economy through this turmoil and lessen the pain, nazir said on his instagram account last thursday, after the surprise appointment. i hope the new economic committee will take the bull by the horns and introduce radical reforms rather than adopt superficial measures. we are coming from a position of weakness because of the current policy framework, and politics is a sign of that weakness. too much politics is bad for economics and progress, says tan sri ramon navaratnam, chairman of aslis centre for public policy studies. others, however, point out that malaysia already has res- pected policymakers like bank negara malaysia governor tan sri zeti akhtar aziz, who was not selected to join the committee, whose chairman, datuk seri abdul wahid omar, is minister in the prime ministers department in charge of the economic planning unit. they also reckon the ringgits precipitous fall in recent weeks was more than a mere reflection of wavering confidence. inceif emeritus professor datuk mohamed ariff, for one, says the country needs to act fast to regain confidence and credibility, and that there are clear writings on the wall that malaysias economic fundamentals have weakened considerably in recent times. it appears that the country is in denial mode u2026 the sharp fall in commodity prices, rapidly shrinking ringgit, ballooning external debt, ailing stock market and falling central bank reserves are all taking a heavy toll on the malaysian economy. and yet, we keep hearing that the fundamentals are still strong. such talk only serves to dampen investor sentiment further, as these give rise to the impression that the government cannot even recognise or understand that there is a problem in the first place, let alone fix it, he says, adding that malaysia cannot blame all its woes on external factors. the crisis the country currently faces is largely home-grown. it smacks of poor governance and mismanagement. the ongoing financial scandals speak volumes. the poor handling of the issues with no straight answers and the absence of checks and balances have affected the countrys image in the global arena u2026 the economy is bogged down in a crisis of confidence and credibility. to put the economy back on track, we must restore confidence and credibility, which can only come with increased transparency, disclosures and accountability. that malaysias public debt has ballooned considerably on the back of 18 straight years of budget deficits limits policy manoeuvres when the country needs to weather global economic headwinds. while the headline debt-to-gross domestic product ratio is below the 55% self-imposed ceiling, public debt is north of 66% if quasi-government guarantees were to be included, experts say. stock market volatility, commodity market selldown and economic slowdown in china, not to mention the eurozone malaise, are all symptomatic of an impending global deflation, says ariff, without providing a timeframe. as he sees it, malaysia is most vulnerable to happenings in the chinese economy, as china is currently the number one destination for malaysias exports and number one source of malaysias imports. obviously, we are less prepared now than we were in the mid-nineties for such eventualities. in the mid-nineties, we had five consecutive years of budget surplus (1993-1997), our short-term external debts accounted for less than a third of the total. now, we are inflicted with budget deficits year after year since 1998, while foreigners hold roughly half of government bonds, says ariff. with at least 25% of government revenue still coming from oil and gas (although down from 39.6% in 2008), experts like him doubt higher tax receipts, including those from the newly implemented goods and services tax, can fully make up for smaller oil-related receipts, thus there is limited room for fiscal stimulus. a new normal for oil prices, at us$30 to us$40, should it happen, will likely imply a significantly higher fiscal deficit (exceeding 4% of gdp) and a structurally lower current account surplus, says chua hak bin, head of emerging asia economics at bank of america merrill lynch (baml). it will also mean that the government can no longer rely on petronas (petroliam nasional bhd) as a lender and banker of last resort in times of crisis, he says. already, the national oil company, when announcing a 47% drop in its second-quarter net profit on aug 14, said it needed to draw on its reserves and persevere with more austerity measures as its operating cash was not enough to cover both its capital expenditure and the rm26 billion dividend committed to the government this year. policy options are becoming more limited. governor zeti and prime minister najib have ruled out capital controls. forex intervention will have to be conducted more sparingly, given the rapid depletion of bank negaras foreign exchange reserves, chua says, adding that us$8.8 billion was spent defending the ringgit in july and another us$2.2 billion in the first two weeks of august. bank negara will release its end-august reserves figures on sept 4. as at mid-august, the central banks reserves stood at us$94.5 billion (rm356.4 billion), down 33.2% from the recent peak of us$141.43 billion in may 2013. while the reserves are still adequate to finance 7.5 times retained imports and are one times short-term external debt, rhb research institute executive chairman and chief economist lim chee sing says the latter is a weakness and a concern should there be a more significant erosion in foreign investor confidence, causing them to sell down their holdings of financial assets in the country and/or withdraw whatever deposits they have placed with the malaysian banking system. while local institutions, such as the employees provident fund  whose total investment assets stood at rm667.21 billion as at end-june 2015  insurance companies and sovereign wealth funds, have sufficient liquidity to absorb foreign selling, lim says price will have to give if there is continuous foreign selling. that foreign investors still hold 47.84% of the rm345.84 billion outstanding malaysian government securities means there will be pressure on the ringgit and bank negara reserves if redemptions accelerate the way they did on the local equity market where foreign holdings are estimated at around 23% in august. foreigners have pulled rm11.8 billion out of the local bourse year to date, surpassing the rm6.9 billion net outflow for the whole of 2014. between march 2013 and june 2015, the balance of payments saw rm29.1 billion net outflow, largely because the rm129.2 billion net outflow from the financial account exceeded the rm100.4 billion net inflow in the current account, where a surplus position has dropped to rm7.58 billion in june 2015 from nearly rm40 billion in september 2008 as malaysias exports to the world fell faster than its imports. a negative balance of payments erodes bank negaras reserves position. the impending us federal reserve interest rate hike, under current market conditions, will only worsen the sell-off in the ringgit, bamls chua says, pointing out that the market currently expects 50% chance of a rate hike happening by year-end and only 16% in september. our [ringgit-us dollar] forecast of 4.28 is for end-2016 and is now close to being breached. we will review the forecast, pending our assessment on the fed rate decision, given current market developments, he adds. the us federal market open committee is scheduled to meet in mid-september, late-october and mid-december this year. bank negaras monetary policy committee will meet three days earlier, on sept 11, when it is expected to keep the key interest rate unchanged, at 3.25%. citi research economist kit wei zheng, in a recent note, says the 100 to 150 basis point rate hike that most thought is needed to defend the ringgit is unpalatable, given softening growth and limited evidence of imported inflation. drastic rate hikes will also be counter-productive as softer domestic demand and knock-on impact from non-oil fiscal revenues could give speculators another reason to short the ringgit, he adds. malaysias high household debt, at 87.8% of gdp  among the highest in the region  also raises the odds of savers being taxed with negative real (inflation-adjusted) returns. deutsche bank economist diana del-rosario is more sanguine about bank negaras reserves building up again, pointing out that malaysia recorded a surplus in the balance of payments in the second quarter, driven by a turnaround of other investments like loans and forex deposits to net inflows. we do not know the reason behind these inflows, but we suspect they could be due to the weaker ringgit or a result of a government/bank negara initiative to contain the decline in reserves. if so, then it is likely these inflows could continue for the rest of the year, she says, adding that the current account surplus could also widen as exports slightly improve and imports soften because of weak demand prospects. she also reckons the government could make modest adjustments to its foreign exchange administration policies such as cutting the time limit for the repatriation of export proceeds to less than six months. according to citis economists, a sizeable difference between trade data reported by malaysia and its trading partners suggested that a chunk of export earnings were kept offshore, notwithstanding bank negara regulations that export proceeds have to be repatriated within six months. still, they also told clients that the governments appeal to repatriate liquid foreign assets had hitherto had only limited effects as some government-linked investment companies claimed that such decisions would have to be made primarily on commercial grounds, given the need to hit target returns. an easier option would be the conversion of about us$30 billion of foreign currency deposits with onshore banks, the aug 24 note reads. yet the impact of such moves would be fleeting, should there be high selling pressure, experts admit. whether the market has been overly bearish and if there is more weakness to come will depend largely on whether the major world economies can do more to hold up growth, if need be, or whether more policy missteps  such as chinas heavy intervention in the equity markets and renminbi devaluation that derailed confidence  are being taken to cause the global growth cycle to turn down earlier than expected. whether malaysia has enough policy options to weather the storm also depends on the extent of the storm, and whether it is global in nature, although there is room for the country to take appropriate measures to mitigate it, rhbs lim says. over the longer term, he says malaysia  which is stuck in the middle-income trap  needs a stronger ringgit to encourage industries to gradually advance up the value chain to restore competitiveness. emphasis on the quality of products and services with good branding is what we need as the country evolves into a developed country by 2020. that means malaysia needs to get its act together quickly for the ringgit to strengthen again.  this article first appeared in digitaledge weekly, on august 31 - september 6, 2015."}, "137":

property development businesses after it failed to secure deals to diversify into the resources sector in indonesia last year. the group has the capacity to take up about rm1 billion worth of construction jobs a year, says its group managing director and largest shareholder datuk seri chong ket pen. protascos construction order book stands at about rm640 million currently, which can last the group for two years, says chong. we are actively bidding for jobs to replenish the orders so that earnings from the construction business can grow further. we are quite confident of securing a good success rate of between 30% and 40% of the tenders we bid for, says chong in an exclusive interview with the edge. the success rate target is quite bullish for protasco (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 1.20), a mid-size construction company with a market capitalisation of rm618.5 million. if protasco manages to secure 30% of the tenders, its order book will almost double to rm1.24 billion. we can do more. if we hit big (in securing contracts), we can always double the workforce and machinery to take on more jobs, says chong. protasco wants to forge ahead in the construction and property development sector, says chong, putting an end to any question of whether the group is going to pursue diversification into the oil and gas sector. in january last year, the company announced the acquisition of a 63% stake in an indonesian oil and gas company, pt anglo slavic indonesia (asi), for rm68.4 million from pt anglo slavic utama (asu). the deal was later aborted after the sale and purchase agreement lapsed. a boardroom tussle between chong and datuk tey por yee, a substantial shareholder of protasco, followed. protasco alleged that tey and his partner ooi kock aun, who were both board members of the group from late-2012 to 2014, had breached their fiduciary and statutory duties. chong alleged that tey and ooi held indirect interests in asu. protasco sued asu to return the us$22 million it had paid for the purchase of the stake in asi. tey and ooi later counter-sued chong and protasco, alleging that rm10 million had been siphoned off to chongs private vehicle. however, on june 3, tey and oois counterclaim was struck out by the kuala lumpur high court. the suit by protasco is set for trial on oct 1 and 2. tey and ooi have filed for a stay application pending arbitration. when asked about the lawsuits, chong declines to dwell on them, saying that he is leaving them to the courts to decide and just wants to focus on protascos current businesses. he adds the squabble with tey does not affect protascos ability to secure jobs and deliver good earnings to shareholders. with its oil and gas aspirations snuffed out, protasco can focus on growing its construction and property development business. however, it has only been getting government contracts and concessions so far.  the bulk of the groups orders is made up of the rm578.5 million contract to build 1,680 apartments for civil servants in putrajaya. protasco bid for jobs for petronas refinery and petrochemical integrated development project in johor last year but did not manage to clinch any, reveals chong. protasco is arguably an expert in road construction and maintenance through its subsidiaries roadcare (m) sdn bhd and hcm engineering sdn bhd. roadcare holds a 15-year concession to maintain federal roads in the states of selangor, pahang, kelantan and terengganu worth rm358 million. meanwhile, hcm holds a 15-year concession to maintain federal roads in sibu, bintulu and mukah in sarawak worth rm232 million. roadcare and hcms concessions will expire in february 2016 and february 2018 respectively. chong says protasco is in negotiations to renew the roadcare concession in selangor. midf research analyst hafiz hassan does not expect any problem there as the the same concession in the southern region has been renewed. that will guarantee the bulk of the groups earnings visibility for the next 10 years, says hafiz in a research report dated may 28, 2015. the road maintenance business contributed about half of protascos revenue of rm1.15 billion last year, and about 70% of its profit after tax of rm67 million. besides the federal road maintenance concessions, protasco also has long-term contracts to maintain state roads in selangor, terengganu and perak. the selangor contract will expire in september this year, followed by the terengganu contract in july next year and the perak job in december 2019. the contracts are valued at about rm240 million. protasco is negotiating with the selangor government to renew the contract, confirms chong. however, chong feels that protasco should grow its construction business to give its shareholders double-digit earnings growth. nevertheless, i am comfortable with the outstanding order book that we have right now, although we can always take in more. we can assure our shareholders an earnings growth of about 15% this year, he says. in early april, the group secured from malaysian resources corp bhd a federal road construction contract worth rm77 million in sarawak and a rm58 million contract to connect jalan klang lama with the new pantai expressway. in the first quarter ended march 31, protascos net profit grew 24% to rm13.1 million, compared with rm10.6 million in the same quarter last year. revenue increased 48% to rm219.1 million from rm147.8 million. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated

design plan. ophirs first oil timeline by the second half of 2016, remains unchanged, bimb said in a company update note. according to ses, the domestic oilfield revenue contribution would remain low, due to lower rig counts and activities in malaysia, where five out of nine rigs belong to petronas. contributions to ses from petronas are expected to decline from 16% to average about 8% of companys

field developments locally, and india and indonesia via partnerships. ses aims to improve its gross profit margin from the current 24.4% to a range of 26%, by adopting a more stringent control on its

klci has recovered somewhat since it fell to a low of 1,674 points in mid-december last year. the index reached a high of 1,856.51 points last tuesday, before retreating to close at 1,844.31 points on friday. hurt by the weak ringgit and low oil prices, the fbm klcis decline towards the end of 2014 had wiped out considerable gains from the years high, which had briefly exceeded 1,890 points in july when the market had begun to look overvalued. this year, the local bellwether has gained more than 5% to date. meanwhile, its regional peers, the hang seng index and nikkei 225, have each gained over 14%. at current levels, which is almost back to last years high, fund managers and analysts are mixed about the local stock markets valuations  some say it is still overvalued, while others say there is still upside potential. pacific mutual fund bhd chief investment officer koh huat soon believes that at the current price-earnings ratio (per) of 16 times, the fbm klci is overvalued as it is trading above the historical average. according to him, the expensive valuation is mainly supported by government-linked domestic funds. the government faces tremendous challenges in meeting budget targets as we are not out of the woods yet in terms of the impact of cheap oil prices on the budget and current account. this makes malaysia vulnerable to a credit rating downgrade, he tells the edge. as it is, fitch ratings last month said malaysias credit rating is more than 50% likely to be downgraded on a worsening trade balance and the inability of state investment fund 1malaysia development bhd (1mdb) to meet its debt obligations. pacific mutual expects the fbm klci to reach 1,817 points by year-end, 1.6% lower than its current level. we dont see much upside. with headwinds before us  namely the challenges of meeting budget targets, shrinking current account surplus, heightened political risks and threat of a rating downgrade  it is difficult to justify paying above-mean valuation for this market at the moment, koh explains. on the contrary, danny wong, chief executive of areca capital sdn bhd, believes that factors such as weak oil prices, the impact of the goods and services tax (gst) and the possibility of a rating downgrade have largely been priced in. i think many have priced in the negative factors. some foreign funds may return due to our economic growth and continued economic transformation programme initiatives, especially our subsidy reforms. what we need is to overcome the bearish ringgit issues, wong tells the edge. the ringgit has plunged more than 18% against the greenback since august last year, hitting a low of 3.73 on march 20, 2015. it is currently hovering around 3.66. wong says the fbm klci and malaysian stocks in general deserve a premium over their peers due to their defensive nature and high dividend yields. over at etiqa insurance and takaful, head of research chris eng says the fbm klci is not yet overvalued. however, the market is expected to continue seeing some volatility, and etiqa is forecasting a broad range of 1,828 to 1,870 points for the year. the following are some fbm klci component stocks on the radar screen of the investment community that may be worth a look. tenaga nasional bhd on tenaga, we continue to see relatively low coal prices and increasing market share as the company completes its manjung 4 [coal-fired] power plant and hydro dams, says eng. manjung 4 recently missed its end-march commercial operation date and is expected to be delayed for another two to four weeks. but ta securities james ratnam says the delay is not expected to have any operational impact on tenaga (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.8) given the short delay and 30% reserve margin. tenagas unit fuel cost is expected to fall as it increases the use of coal  a cheaper alternative to gas  in the coming quarters as manjung 4 comes on stream, says pacific mutuals koh. lower generation cost would present an opportunity for the subsidy on liquefied natural gas to be reduced without an adverse impact on tariff during the next review. tenaga has also just received 90.21% acceptance for its offer to take over integrax bhd, a strategic move that will ensure the latter focuses on its coal handling services to tenagas janamanjung power plant complex. including the 1,000mw manjung 5, the complex will have a total capacity of 4,000mw  16% of peninsular malaysias capacity. ta raised its target price on tenaga to rm16.29 from rm16.25, and has a buy call on the stock. tenaga closed at rm14.50 last friday with a per of over 11 times  still cheap, according to etiqas eng. as it is, tenaga trades on a calendar 2016 per of just 12 times against the markets fbm100 per of 15 times. tenaga deserves to be re-rated to at least parity with the market, says koh. rhb capital bhd a catalyst to watch for in rhb cap is a possible internal reorganisation of the group, whereby rhb bank will take over rhb caps listing status and house all its entities. the exercise, which could include a rights issue, is expected to improve the groups tax efficiency, although details are not yet clear. on rhb cap, plans to restructure the bank and the return of foreign interest (to the fbm klci) should help boost the company, which also has a new ceo, says eng. on march 5, rhb cap (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 2.1) announced that group ceo kellee kam had resigned from his position. this will take effect in may. the group has identified a successor and is awaiting bank negara malaysias approval. some quarters do not expect the banking sector to see exciting prospects in the near term. that said, rhb caps valuations may still be a selling point at this time. bank stocks are not currently overvalued. they are good as defensive and dividend-yielding stocks, says edmund tham, head of research at mercury securities sdn bhd. consumer loan growth may be slower due to the gst, which may affect sentiment, and bank negara guidelines [which may result in] low approval rates. but corporate banking, trade finance and investment banking will still be growing, he adds. where rhb cap is concerned, its 12 months trailing per is just under 11 times  compared with public bank bhds 16 times and malayan banking bhds 13 times  and it has a dividend yield of 1.96%. public bank in a banking sector that is experiencing a slowdown in growth and an increase in non-performing loans, public bank (fundamental: 2.8; valuation: 1.5) has largely bucked the trend. the banking group outperformed its peers by a large margin in numerous valuation metrics, and its position as a favoured stock among fund managers could point to further upside. public banks share price is expensive but investors are willing to pay a premium because it is perceived as a defensive pick. the stock carries a large weight in the composite index, so it has to be reflected in a fund managers portfolio, says koh. compared with its banking peers, public bank was a top performer for the financial year ended dec 31, 2014. return on equity stood at 19.9% compared with the industry average of 13%. its loan growth saw a 10.8% increase on a year-on-year basis, also outperforming the industry average of 8.7%. in a march 25 note, affin hwang capital research says it expects the banking group to continue the outperformance this year, pegging a target price of rm21.80 to the stock. the group has the lowest gross impaired loan ratio (of 0.65%), the number one position in franchise retail banking and a well-capitalised balance sheet, it says. misc bhd ever since the failed takeover bid by national oil firm petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) in 2013, miscs (fundamental: 2; valuation: 1) share price has appreciated by leaps and bounds. the stock gained 24% this year as at april 10, making it one of the best-performing stocks among the 30 constituents in the fbm klci. being one of the few niche industry stocks on the component index, misc is influenced by external factors in the shipping sector. with the prevailing low oil price environment prompting companies to store their oil inventory, crude tanker rates have seen a resurgence, thanks to the uptick in demand. a lifting of sanctions on iranian oil production is also set to offset the delivery of newbuild ships, ensuring that tanker demand outpaces supply. both factors are significant re-rating catalysts for misc. in a prolonged situation of cheap oil, the demand for storage will continue to grow if the oil oversupply continues. current crude tanker rates are already at multi-year highs, which is indicative of a longer-term trend, says an analyst of a bank-backed research house, who has a buy rating on misc.  this article first appeared in

valuation: 1), which in turn has a 66.5% interest in mhb (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 1.8). in a statement today, marc noted that since its initial assessment in february last year, mhbs standalone profile has weakened, mainly due to a declining order book and weakening margins arising from competitive pressures in the offshore engineering works sector. mhbs order book of rm1.6 billion as at end-2014 provides earnings visibility until the first quarter of 2016. \"we view the groups (mhb's) ability to restore its order book to healthier levels over the near term to be challenging in light of weakened prospects for the upstream oil and gas sector following the sharp plunge in crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2014,\" the rating agency said. \"oil majors, including petronas, have reduced capex or deferred/canceled projects, translating into weak order book replenishments for offshore oil and gas fabrication services providers. nonetheless, mhb could secure contracts from petronas given that the national oil company is still expected to spend rm54 billion in 2015, from an earlier forecast of rm60 billion. \"mhbs strong domestic position in fabrication would underpin its ability to compete under petronas policy of awarding contracts on a competitive basis,\" added marc. mhb is currently undertaking the malikai tlp and sk316 projects for sabah shell petroleum co ltd and petronas carigali sdn bhd respectively; these projects account for about 63% of the total order book and are expected to be completed by end-2015 and first quarter of 2016 respectively. marc also noted that mhbs major capital expenditure (capex) programme remains its yard optimisation programme, which commenced in 2006, for which mhb has spent rm1.1 billion of the budgeted rm2.5 billion. \"while mhb has utilised internal funds and proceeds from its initial public offering listing in 2011 to fund its capex programme to date, part of the proceeds from the proposed sukuk issuance will be earmarked to meet its requirement of about rm233 million for fy15,\" it added. should mhb fully draw down under the sukuk programme, its pro forma debt-to-equity ratio would rise from a low 0.1 times as at end-fy2014 to a manageable 0.5 times. nevertheless, marc said downward pressure on mhbs standalone rating could emerge if the group is unable to replenish its order book to a level that would prevent its financial metrics from weakening. \"any deterioration in its financial performance over the near term could also trigger an outlook revision and/or downward rating migration,\" it said. mhb shares closed down 1.65% to close at rm1.19 today, bringing a market capitalisation of rm1.94 billion.

is now on the market for about rm71.08 million or rm3,500 per sq ft. if the sale goes through at that price, it will set a new benchmark for jalan raja chulan, say consultants. the parcel is less than 2km from suria klcc and 900m from pavilion kuala lumpur. its exclusive agent is dtz malaysia. according to an advertisement placed in the feb 2 issue of city & country, the parcel comes with a development order (do) for a 39-storey tower that can accommodate 136 serviced apartments. of these, 34 units are 1+1-bedroom types, 100 units are 2-bedroom types and two are penthouses, says dtz malaysia managing director eddy wong. he adds that the parcel comes with a plot ratio of eight, giving it a gross floor area of 162,472 sq ft and a net lettable area of 111,800 sq ft. there is a lot of interest as this site is in a very strategic location, being within walking distance of both pavilion kl and the petronas twin towers. usually, you are close to one and not the other, he tells city & country. while wong declines to name the vendors of the site, a search by city & country shows that the parcel is owned by klk development sdn bhd. the company is not related to kuala lumpur kepong bhd, a plantation company with a property development arm. is the asking price too high? its not really expensive if you consider the fact that the last two transactions in the klcc area were around rm3,300 psf u2026 we think the potential buyers will be those who dont want to go through the hassle of getting the necessary planning approvals, which is the appeal of buying with the do in the first place, says wong. in 2013, ksk group bhd bought 3.95 acres in jalan conlay from singapore-based developer uol group ltd for rm568 million or rm3,299 psf. the groups unit, ksk land sdn bhd, is currently developing over 1,000 luxury serviced residences and a hotel, both to be managed by kempinski, atop a retail podium (see our cover story). last may, tropicana corp bhd sold 3.14 acres in jalan bukit bintang to offshore triangle sdn bhd  a company jointly owned by tropicana and hong kong-listed developer agile property holdings ltd on a 30:70 basis  for rm448.4 million cash or rm3,280 psf. the land is earmarked for a mixed-use development. both parcels did not come with dos. however, an industry observer says the two transactions took place within kuala lumpur city centre, whereas jalan raja chulan falls on the fringe of the area. that said, the parcel is still in the golden triangle where opportunities to buy empty parcels are fairly uncommon, he says. it also comes with a do and a decent plot ratio, he adds. meanwhile, henry butcher malaysia sdn bhd chief operating officer tang chee meng says a notable transaction was the sale of a 3.11-acre parcel in jalan ampang by loke wan yat realty sdn bhd to singapore developer oxley group for rm446 million or rm3,300 psf. other transactions are of smaller parcels located off jalan raja chulan (in jalan bukit ceylon, changkat ceylon and changkat raja chulan), which were done at rm650 psf to as high as rm2,200 psf, he adds. laurelcap sdn bhd director stanley toh, meanwhile, says rm3,500 psf is on the higher side of the spectrum, taking into account the current property market sentiment. while he describes the location as superb, given that it is within walking distance of major shopping centres and near the much-coveted bukit bintang and jalan sultan ismail addresses, he says with a plot ratio of eight, the developer would have to break the barrier of serviced apartment prices in kl to make the land cost feasible. with the land cost at rm3,500 psf, you would probably need to get a plot ratio of 10 and above in order for the project to be viable. unfortunately, the timing is not the best to realise the full potential of the land. nevertheless, holding power is key in these trying times as the market will be back in full swing in the next cycle. tang, however, feels that the development can be financially viable because jalan raja chulan is a prime location. however, the developer will have to come out with an extraordinary design and sales package and ensure sales happen at a quick pace as there is little room for error. it will also have to price the units above rm2,000 psf, which will make it more challenging as it will be higher than a nearby project and considering the softer market. the small land size will also pose some design constraints as parking space will have to go up many floors to accommodate the numbers required, he adds.  market for serviced apartments what is the market like for serviced apartments now? wong, citing venus assets sdn bhds four seasons place branded residences next to the petronas twin towers and alpine return sdn bhds star residences in jalan yap kwan seng, says the response to both properties was heartening. according to a source familiar with four seasons place, the branded residences sales are at 80% since the project was launched in 1q2013. typical units have built-ups of 1,098 sq ft to 3,843 sq ft and layouts of 1+1 bedrooms to 4+1 bedrooms. a mid-size unit recently sold for over rm3,400 psf, the highest price so far, says the source. meanwhile, star residences first phase has achieved 80% sales since it was launched in january last year, says alpine return chief operating officer alan koh. the first phase comprises 557 units with built-ups of 625 to 722 sq ft, and 1-bedroom and 1+1-bedroom units. they were sold for rm1,600 psf, or between rm1 million and rm1.3 million each. the second phase, which is scheduled to be launched in september, will comprise 482 units with built-ups of 700 to 800 sq ft. these will be sold at rm2,000 to rm2,100 psf, says koh. meanwhile, tang says units with built-ups of 600 to 800 sq ft are easier to sell, whereas the opposite is true for units above 2,000 sq ft. market sentiment is generally softer and speculative activities have declined significantly. end financing is a major issue faced by buyers, he adds. laurelcaps toh says the national property information centres third quarter 2014 residential property stock report shows that the existing stock of serviced apartments in seksyen 1 to 100 (jalan raja chulan falls under seksyen 57) stands at 11,203 units, with another 10,305 units under construction and 1,431 units planned. he also observes that the current market is not the best one for high-end developments. he adds that the market is still driven by local rather than foreign demand. nevertheless, there is a small group of purchasers with interest in high-end serviced residences accompanied by a high-end and branded operator such as banyan tree, for example. however, this group is quite limited and this trend has already been tapped by developers. brands such as harrods, kempinski and jumeirah are some of the operators that will be making their foray into kuala lumpur, he says. so in short, while the jalan raja chulan parcels location is fantastic, buyers will need to either come up with an outstanding product and marketing plan, apply for a higher plot ratio or have enough holding power to wait for the next property cycle, say consultants.

fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2014, plunged 87.2% to rm8.67 million or 1.33 sen share, while revenue dipped 6.7% to rm1.26 billion, as fierce promotional campaigns in the automotive sector hit profit margins. its 2014 full year net profit also dropped 57.82% to rm105.85 million, as revenue fell 8.4% to rm4.76 billion. in its filing to bursa malaysia, the nissan vehicles distributor said due to the highly competitive environment in the local automotive industry, it had stepped up promotional campaigns to sustain market share and reduce its inventory, at the expense of profit margins. the group noted the strong promotional campaigns had reduced its inventory to rm1.52 billion as at dec 31, 2014, from rm1.73 billion as at dec 31, 2013. tan chong noted its prospects remain challenging, as the weakening ringgit has added pressure on the imported costs of materials required in the automotive industry.

"}, "177": {"date_posted": "16/2/2015", "title": "trade wise: unchanged tariffs a boost for tenaga", "article": " the sharp fall in crude oil prices that has pulled down global energy costs had raised hopes that electricity tariffs might subsequently be cut. however, the ministry of energy, green technology and water last week announced that electricity tariffs are expected to remain relatively unchanged for the rest of the year. this isnt welcome news for the public, but it bodes well for tenaga nasional bhd (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1), whose share price surged 3.99% to close at rm15.10 on friday after the announcement. but is the optimism about tenagas earnings premature, or did the ministry miscalculate the impact of lower fuel prices? according to the ministry, the recent decline in oil prices does not have a direct or substantial impact on tenagas fuel costs. if that is the case, tenagas earnings would not get a boost from lower fuel costs even if tariffs were not revised downwards. nonetheless, tenaga last thursday unveiled a 34.37% year-on-year jump in net profit for the first quarter ended nov 30, 2014. the earnings rise was attributed to a drop in fuel costs as well as the 14.9% effective hike in electricity tariff at the beginning of 2014 that boosted revenue by 15.2% to rm11.03 billion in the same period. in fact, tenagas earnings performance trumped analysts expectations. seventeen analysts upgraded their target price on tenaga to an average of rm16.99. crude price has plunged, but that has not yet translated into lower lng price (up to 6-month lag) as we understand tenagas lng purchase price in january-march remained firm at rm46.53 per mmbtu (vs rm46.04 in 4qcy14). however, tenaga may benefit from lower gas usage in 2qfy15 given a more favourable fuel mix towards hydro and coal, potentially leading to another strong quarter, writes alliancedbs in a research report. for 4mfy15 (sept to dec 2014), coal price averaged us$64 per tonne, 27% lower than the us$87.5 imputed in the existing tariff formula. we expect the coal price to stay low due to oversupply and a weaker demand outlook, which will benefit tenaga, it adds. if this trend continues and tariffs remain unchanged, tenaga might be able to book better earnings despite the ministrys reservations. that said, these gains could be offset if the government allows petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) to resume increasing the price of piped natural gas. petronas currently supplies about 1,000 mmscfd of natural gas to tenaga at a regulated price of rm15.20 per mmbtu. the natural gas price is supposed to be increased by rm1.50 to gradually put it on par with the market price under the gas subsidy rationalisation scheme. each rm1.50 hike will increase tenagas fuel cost by about rm280 million for a six-month period. the money would be a welcome boost to petronas revenue a time when it is grappling with low oil prices. hence, counter-intuitively, tenagas piped natural gas price could actually increase even though crude oil prices are on the decline. to be fair, tenaga has been enjoying cheap gas for many years at petronas expense in the form of foregone revenue, given that the national oil firm could have exported the fuel at international prices. note that in his budget revision speech, prime minister datuk seri najib razak only stated that the piped gas price for industrial use would not be raised, but made no such commitment on gas used by tenaga for generating power. although the cost of fuel prices may be falling in the market, the tariff might not be reduced in july. it will also depend on the price of piped gas if the government decides to resume the price increase of rm1.50 per mmbtu, explains datin roslina zainal, vice-president of tenagas regulatory economics and planning division. on the balance of things, it looks like unchanged tariffs will be beneficial to tenaga going forward. nonetheless, roslina points out that the biggest factor that will affect tenagas fuel costs going forward will be the amount of imported lng it uses. compared to piped gas that costs rm15.20 per mmbtu, imported lng, which has to be shipped in and re-gasified, cost tenaga about rm46.041 per mmbtu in the fourth quarter (october to december of 2014). interestingly, tenaga has little say in the cost of lng, since it is a price taker and the price is set by petronas, which procures the lng. according to the ministry, the price of lng supplied is still high since it is linked to the ex-bintulu lng price and the japan customs-cleared crude (jccc) price with a time lag of 2-4 months and 5-7 months, respectively. the price of lng remains above the reference price in the base tariff (rm41.68 per mmbtu). if the amount used is more than expected, it may offset any savings from the falling coal price, explains roslina. that said, there is some expectation that lng prices will start to taper off towards the second half of the year, which could translate into potential savings for tenaga. unchanged tariffs despite cost pass-through come july, if tariffs are not revised based on the imbalance cost pass-through (icpt) mechanism, the country would have gone almost two years at the same tariff. the last hike was in january 2014 and the next will only be in january 2016. this runs contrary to the governments long-term goal of allowing fuel costs to be passed through to consumers. in fact, there were supposed to have been two tariff hikes in the past year based on the icpt calculations  one in july 2014 and another in january this year. this is another reason there isnt much room for a downward revision in tariffs, since they werent raised when costs were higher in the first place. nonetheless, roslina points out that the icpt has been fully implemented on tenagas part. tenaga calculates the icpt difference and submits it to the government. if it is higher than the base tariff, the government then decides if it wants to raise the tariff or offset the difference by other means, like delaying gas price increases or utilising ppa (power purchase agreement) savings to offset the increase in fuel costs, explains roslina. simply put, the government is still intervening heavily in electricity tariffs instead of allowing the cost to be passed through to the consumers. this is both a populist decision and one aimed at supporting a slowing economy that is facing rising inflation. nonetheless, analysts and industry players see it as a positive move if tariffs are allowed to more closely track global energy prices. keeping the tariff fixed would boost tenagas earnings in the short term as fuel costs are coming down. but showing political will to allow tariffs to move in tandem with the fuel cost trend is even more critical as this will mean that tenaga will not have to shoulder the fuel cost burden as it did in the past.  nonetheless, investing sentiment on tenaga is getting more bullish simply because there isnt much concern about rising fuel costs on the horizon. at 14 times earnings, tenaga is still attractive for a company that has regulated assets. it is difficult to fund regulated assets at this valuation elsewhere. as long as the implementation of incentive-based regulation is maintained, tenaga will continue to perform, says one fund manager.

jalan belfield, jalan hose and jalan talalla, appears to have caught the attention of a least four developers, which will collectively build offices, shoplots and some 2,500 serviced apartments. tycoon tan sri syed mokhtar albukhary and the late tan sri lim goh tongs family have plans for mixed-use development projects in jalan belfield, which is located less than 2km from the proposed menara warisan merdeka (project name: kl118) undertaken by permodalan nasional bhd (pnb). two other players that will join in are listed companies salcon bhd and bina puri holdings bhd. together, the projects are expected to cover 20 acres (see map). property players say a combination of factors is driving developers to this area. scarcity of land in the kl sentral area and infrastructure improvement in and around the location (kampung attap) have led to interest. this, coupled with high land prices in other locations, could have been the push factor. the pull factor would be faster approvals by dbkl (kuala lumpur city hall) after the relocation of the palace, zerin properties ceo previndran singhe tells the edge.  stanley toh, director of valuation and real estate consultancy firm laurelcap sdn bhd, agrees that scarcity of land is driving developers to kampung attap, which, incidentally, comprises largely government land. this area is one of the last in kl that is still undeveloped. recently, it became a strategic location due to new mega developments in the neighbourhood, such as the menara warisan merdeka project, the redevelopment of pudu jail (bukit bintang) and the mass rapid transit station in jalan maharajalela, as well as its proximity to kl sentral. he adds that the emergence of menara warisan merdeka  it will be the countrys tallest building when completed  will see history repeat itself, just like when the then worlds tallest structure was built in kuala lumpur city centre. when the petronas twin towers/klcc was constructed in the 1990s, the entire world started to know its location. the surrounding areas have benefited  property prices skyrocketed, and until today, foreigners are only comfortable investing in areas close to klcc. i see a very similar occurrence with menara warisan merdeka, and it is clearly evident in the number of proposed developments in the vicinity.  salcon (fundamental: 2.1; valuation: 3), too, appears to be banking on a repeat of the klcc success story in kampung attap. its executive director datuk eddy leong describes menara warisan merdeka and the planned infrastructure/transport upgrade as the new epicentre of growth in kl. the company plans to build offices, retail units and serviced apartments in kampung attap. menara warisan merdeka will be another iconic development not only for kuala lumpur but also for malaysia. we expect it to have the same effect [that] klcc has on the surrounding properties, leong says. pnb merdeka ventures sdn bhd is constructing the 118-storey building, which will feature 80 floors of office space and five floors of serviced apartments. thirteen floors will be allocated for a hotel. this project will include an eight-storey retail podium. sources say a two-level tunnel, named belfield tunnel, will link the fourth and fifth basement floors of the building to kampung attap, thereby bringing the areas now separated by jalan maharajalela closer. cheaper land, good take-up bina puri (fundamental: 0.15; valuation: 1.8) appears to be the first among the four developers identified with projects in kampung attap, to launch its project, as it has obtained the necessary approvals. called opus kuala lumpur, the project is in jalan talalla and its official launch is slated for the first quarter of this year. land prices here are considerably cheaper. this allows for an upside for the purchasers, as opposed to the klcc area where developers have to sell at rm1,500 psf and above to be able to make reasonable profits due to the high land cost, says bina puri group executive director matthew tee kai woon, who refers to menara warisan merdeka as another new landmark instead of klcc. laurelcaps toh says there has been no known recent vacant land transaction in the vicinity. hence, land prices should typically be around rm300 to rm500 psf for residential use and rm500 to rm700 psf for commercial use. salcons leong is confident that the companys project will bring good yield and give it a big boost in the property scene. the take-up rate is anticipated to be good due to its central location and close proximity to public transport  there will be two mrt stations (pasar seni and warisan merdeka), a light rail transit station (pasar seni) and a monorail station (jalan maharajalela) in the vicinity, which will be convenient and attractive to tenants and patrons alike.\na development boost in and around kampung attap again, because of the scarcity of land and anticipated improvement in the infrastructure, kampung attap is expected to welcome more property players in the near future, and with this, nearby areas will be developed, rejuvenated and refreshed. according to toh, apart from the tract within the triangle of jalan kampung attap, jalan belfield and jalan wisma putra, it is not easy to find vacant land. he expects menara warisan merdeka to have a positive impact, leading to more developments in jalan kampung attap, jalan bellamy, jalan hang tuah and jalan hang jebat. he points out that there is also a car park along jalan balai, adjacent to the traffic police station in jalan tun h s lee, which is ready for development. redevelopment of some pre-war buildings in the jalan petaling area into boutique hotels and serviced apartments is also anticipated, he says. salcon, too, foresees the regeneration of some of the older areas in the locality. as these areas develop, previndran feels that the boon will also be in the form of an increase in property values. he opines that the main beneficiaries of the menara warisan merdeka development will be the properties in jalan hang jebat. he anticipates a positive impact on chin woo stadium, the malaysian basketball association, methodist boys school, ywca, olympic council of malaysia and victoria institution. jalan sultan and the rest of chinatown will also benefit from the tower. it is worth noting that the kuala lumpur master plan 2015-2025, released by the tourism unit of dbkl last week, has identified several areas, including kampung attap and jalan petaling, as key areas for conservation and preservation of

be keen on buying island plaza mainly because the group wants to spread its wings in malaysia. indeed, it is in the process of setting up its business in kuala lumpur. ihc is expected to convert the

finalised at this juncture. we will reposition the mall with a women and children-centric theme for all the medical and retail components. he adds that it will be similar to its kuala lumpur city centre project. ihcs core businesses are providing healthcare services and investing, managing and developing healthcare assets, including medical real estate, healthcare-related assets and integrated mixed-use developments. should the deal go through, ihc is expected to invest more than rm150 million on the asset (including the purchase price and costs of refurbishment and medical equipment). it is understood that ihcs plan is to have a mix of medical suites, medical-related and general retail components. in kuala lumpur, ihc is building a 33-storey mixed-used development in jalan kia peng, which will feature specialist medical suites, retail space and serviced residences. it was reported that the project, with a gross floor area of 47,162 sq m, will be completed in 2017. the group has appointed marriott international ltd as the manager for its executive apartments. it bought the parcel of land located in the vicinity of petronas twin towers in 2011 for rm81.36 million. meanwhile, sources say the armf ii has been looking for a buyer for island plaza, located in jalan tanjung tokong, in the past two years. armf is a pan-asian real estate fund managed by pramerica real estate investors ltd, the real estate investment management and advisory business of prudential financial inc of the us. in august 2007, the fund bought the retail portion and unsold offices in island plaza for rm120 million from belleview group. reports said armf had pumped in rm40 million to refurbish the mall back then. the building also includes an eight-storey block, called one one [emailprotected] plaza, which comprises small offices/home offices. the acquisition of island plaza was part of pramericas programme to invest rm1.1 billion in four shopping centres. the other three were greenfield projects  sstwo mall in petaling jaya, selangor, ampang mall and 1st avenue in george town, penang. a combination of factors is said to have contributed to island plaza losing its appeal among retailers and shoppers. among them is that it is a strata property, hence there are difficulties in managing tenancy portfolio. furthermore, shoppers are drawn to new and larger malls nearby, such as gurney plaza extension and straits quay.  repositioning island plaza is possibly a move in the right direction and may turn around its fortunes. after all, penang is well known for its medical tourism.  in 2013, some 770,000 foreign patients contributed us$200 million (rm716 million) in revenue to the country. traditionally, penang accounts for over half the countrys medical tourism earnings. pramericas funds have been trying to divest their assets. sstwo mall is expected to undergo a makeover after failed attempts to dispose of it. it is understood that it is likely to be partially demolished and its retail space reduced. it will also see the addition of serviced apartments. another pramerica-linked mall that was put up for sale was seremban prima, previously known as seremban parade. in 2011, tmw asia property fund 1, a german-based property fund also managed by pramerica, tried to sell three malls  klang parade, ipoh parade and seremban parade  to ara asia dragon fund (an affiliate of hong kong billionaire li ka-shings cheung kong group). however, the deal to dispose of seremban parade fell through. tmw acquired the three malls from the lion group for an estimated rm340 million in 2005. then, pramerica partnered allstones group asia sdn bhd to undertake an asset enhancement exercise to reposition seremban parade. some rm70 million (including the retail tenants portion) was invested and the exercise was completed in the third quarter of 2013. it was renamed seremban prima. in 2006, pramerica bought kinta city shopping centre and last

"article": " kuala lumpur (jan 30): moodys investor service has today affirmed malaysias bond and issuer ratings at a3, and said the outlook remains positive for the ratings. it said the key drivers of its decision are: the governments intention to adhere to its policy of deficit reduction and the resistance of malaysias fundamental credit strengths  notably macroecnomic stability, domestic capital market depth and a favourable government debt structure  to global financial market volatility. we have seen on-going fiscal deficit reduction and actual implementation of significant reforms, [but] the external challenges faced by the country have risen. consequently, moodys has affirmed malaysia at a3 and maintains a positive outlook on the rating, it added. the effectiveness of malaysia's policy response in the year ahead, to challenges already evident  namely, lower global crude oil prices and lackluster global growth  and to those challenges that are expected  namely the normalisation of interest rates by the us federal reserve  will influence the future trajectory of malaysia's sovereign rating, it further opined. it noted the government has set in place the necessary infrastructure to implement the goods and services tax in april 2015. the new tax will bolster revenue over and above the sales and services taxes that it replaces, partly through improved compliance. lower oil prices present potential downside risks to continued strong fiscal performance. the government's ability to continue to meet or exceed fiscal targets in a low oil price environment, will be a key consideration in lifting the sovereign's rating, it said. it noted the government has recently responded to the potential revenue impact from lower oil prices, by implementing cuts to operating expenditure, which it said demonstrated a commitment to fiscal consolidation and to meeting prevailing fiscal rules. however, the full impact of the oil market shock  and the potential for further shocks  will not be known for some time, because a significant proportion of hydrocarbon revenues are derived from liquefied natural gas, the price of which tends to adjust relatively slowly, owing to the long-term nature of supply contracts, it noted. moodys added it expects the stability of dividend payments by petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) and expenditure rationalisation to continue to keep the governments operation balance in surplus, and its stock of debt under 55% of the gross domestic product (gdp). it added that bank negaras solid track record of maintaining low inflation and a stable financial system, continues to anchor the macroeconomic stability of the country. continued fiscal consolidation, underpinned by relatively strong economic growth and favorable funding conditions for the government, potentially supports a higher rating level, it said. in conjunction, the credit rating agency has also affirmed the instrument ratings on senior unsecured debt, issued by khazanah nasional bhd  which is guaranteed by the government  at a3."}, "186": {"date_posted": "30/1/2015", "title": "index rebound stalled at 1,810.21", "article": "

hong leong financial group bhd, petronas chemicals bhd, and tenaga nasional bhd caused the index to fall on foreign selling and liquidation activities. the ringgit remained much weaker against the us dollar at 3.6285 as brent crude oil remained stable at us$46.40 (rm168.43) per barrel. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since may 2013 have key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69 (high), 1,802.88 (low), 1,896.23 (high), 1,837.28 (low), 1,879.62 (high), 1,766.22 (low), 1,858.09 (high),

resistance areas of 1,782, 1,810 and 1,858 will cap any index rebound. the klcis 18 and 40 simple moving average (sma) depict an emerging uptrend for its daily chart. however, the price bars of the index are now between the 50 and 200 sma and remain in a neutral position on that front. the recent fall from its all-time high of 1,896.23 saw a low of 1,671.82. the rebound from 1,671.82 stalled at 1,810.21 (on jan 27, 2015), which is where the key 62% fibonacci retracement level lies. due to the deteriorating tone for the klci, we are recommending a chart sell on petra energy bhd. petra energy released its third quarter of financial year 2014 (3qfy14) results at the end of november 2014, and is expected to announce its 4qfy14 results sometime at the end of february 2015. for its 3qfy14 results announcement, the group saw its nine-month (9mfy14) accumulated profit improve. petra energys revenue rose 25% to rm417 million in 9mfy14 from rm333.4 million in 9mfy13, while profit before tax expanded correspondingly by 15.8% to rm19.8 million in 9mfy14 from rm17.1 million in 9mfy13. according to petra energys announcement, the strong improvement in profitability was attributed to positive contribution from the integrated brownfield maintenance and engineering services segment. overall, petra energy may have improved its profitability in fy14 but investors seem to have taken a more macro approach and discounted the improved profitability as falling crude oil prices and the weak outlook for the oil and gas industry continue to cast a bearish outlook for the sector. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that three research houses cover petra energy, with a hold call, a buy and a sell call. this stock currently trades at a price-earnings ratio of 15.8 times while its price-to-book value ratio of 0.84 times indicates that its share price is trading at a slight discount to its book value. petra energys chart trend, on daily, weekly and monthly time frames, is very firmly down. its share price has made a large decline since its major daily wave-5 and recent high of rm3.16 in june 2014. since that rm3.16 high, petra energy fell to its january 2015 recent low of rm1.32. as prices broke below their recent key critical support levels of rm2.38 and rm1.98, look to sell petra energy on any rebounds to its resistance areas as the mas depict very firm short- to long-term downtrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and stochastic) have issued sell signals and now depict very firm indications of petra energys eventual move towards much lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm1.33, rm1.98 and rm2.38. we expect petra energy to witness weak buying interest at its support levels of rm1.19, rm1.25 and rm1.30. its downside targets are at rm1.31, rm0.80 and rm0.21. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed in the article are

razaks call for government-linked corporations (glc) and government-linked investment companies (glic) to pay out more dividends may help warm investors interest in selected blue-chips. under the revised budget 2015 announced by najib last tuesday, the government is seeking an additional rm400 million in dividends from glcs and glics to help supplement its revenue amid falling crude oil prices. on the macro front, the governments urge for more dividends from such institutions would help shore up investors interests, said areca capital sdn bhd chief executive officer danny wong. with the government calling for more dividends, this could also hopefully attract foreign funds and indirectly help ease the burden of the weaker ringgit, wong told the edge financial daily. however, jf apex securities bhd senior analyst lee cherng wee said whether glcs could pay more dividends would ultimately depend on their ability to grow earnings substantially amid a tougher economic climate. already, many research houses are forecasting a mere single-digit corporate earnings growth this year. cimb research, for one, is projecting 8% growth in malaysias corporate earnings in 2015, a figure that is nothing to shout about given the projected inflation rate as high as 4% this year, with the impending implementation of the goods and services tax. if earnings dont grow as much, glcs would then have to increase their payout ratios in response to the governments needs, said a head of research.  some of the glcs have big capital expenditure (capex) requirements but if the government asked them to pay more dividends, they will still have to oblige, he added, citing the case of petroliam nasional bhd. while the national oil firms management had expressed its reservations on raising dividends, the government has repeatedly reminded the former that it makes the ultimate decision on the level of dividends that the national oil firm has to pay. looking at the list of selected glcs (see table), most have retained earnings that are multifold of their 12-month trailing net profit. an analyst pointed out that s p setia bhd, in which permodalan nasional bhd (pnb) is the major shareholder, is capable of paying a bigger dividend, as there is no major land banking exercise in store in its financial year ending oct 31, 2015 (fy15). s p setia has no big plans so far, said the analyst. the property developer (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 1.2) has a dividend policy of distributing at least 50% of its net profit, with its dividend of 9.7 sen per share in fy14 accounting for about 60% of its earnings per share. with retained earnings that were four times its fy14 net profit of rm405.68 million and no major land acquisitions announced, the group looks to be able to distribute more dividends, some said. meanwhile, another of pnbs listed conglomerates, sime darby bhd (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.3), has retained earnings of rm28.9 billion, which is 8.59 times its trailing 12-month net profit of rm3.36 billion. in addition, its net gearing level is also low at 0.23 times. sime darby has a pending deal to acquire new britain palm oil ltd for some rm5.63 billion. but after this, analysts dont expect a major acquisition by the group, at least in the short term. nevertheless, weak palm oil prices and the slowdown in its china vehicle distribution business may dent sime darbys profitability and crimp its dividends, some said. alliancedbs research, in a note last friday, said companies owned by khazanah nasional bhd are more likely to be the ones asked to pay more dividends, compared with other glcs that are largely owned by trust funds managed by pnb or the employees provident fund. in 2013, khazanah contributed rm650 million in dividends to the government. this suggests that dividends from khazanah will need to be ramped up significantly in order to achieve the [additional] rm400 million target, said the research house in the note. alliancedbs believes the four glcs that could give out more dividends are axiata group bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 0.9), time dotcom bhd (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 0.6), petronas gas bhd (petgas) (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 0.9), and misc bhd (fundamental: 1.6; valuation: 1.8). axiata and time are majority owned by khazanah, while petgas and misc are majority owned by petronas. based on our analysis, axiata is likely to be the major contributor as it has the capacity to raise its payout ratio from 80% (our current estimate) to 100%, given its strong free cash flow from malaysian operations. if this happens, this will raise rm205 million in additional dividends for khazanah, alliancedbs explained. jf apexs lee, who tracks telecommunications stocks, said telcos will have to balance between dividend payout and allocation for their capex. telcos have high capex commitments because they have to build infrastructure. for telekom malaysia bhd (tm), should it get the governments go-ahead to start its second phase of high-speed broadband this year, its cash might be constrained by the huge capex, he said. like axiata, tm is majority owned by khazanah. telcos are seen as dividend-seekers favourites due to their stable earnings and generous payout ratios, although currently their yields are in the range of just 4%. khazanah owns 28.73% of tm (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 0.9) and 37.89% of axiata. in the past four financial quarters, tm paid out a dividend of 25.8 sen per share, which is nearly 97% of its earnings per share of 26.61 sen in the same period. currently, tm has a policy of paying out either rm700 million or a maximum of 90% of its net profit, whichever is higher. either way, tms dividend payout has a limit and is constrained by its performance. back to petronas-owned listed companies, while they might be facing earnings headwinds given the depressed crude oil prices, they are lowly geared. two of them, petgas and petronas chemicals group bhd (pchem), are in net cash positions. however, alliancedbs said that both petgas and pchem (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 1.2) might be constrained by capex requirements for the pengerang regasification terminal project and the refinery and petrochemical integrated development. while no glc has come out since to declare bumper dividends or bigger payouts, many of the blue-chips have seen their share prices move up. between last tuesday and friday, axiata rose 22 sen or 3.15% to rm7.21; sime darby gained 27 sen or 2.91% to rm9.56; petronas dagangan bhd jumped 86 sen or 5.27% to rm17.18; and petgas, meanwhile, rose 96 sen or 4.49% to rm22.36. tenaga nasional bhd (tnb), majority owned by khazanah, was also instrumental in lifting the benchmark index back to the 1,800 level last week. save for last tuesday, the utility giant was consistently in the top gainers rank and it closed the week 60 sen or 4.14% higher to record a fresh high of rm15.10. while tnb (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1) has reported a 34% jump in its net profit for the first quarter ended nov 30, 2014 and is expected to deliver record earnings due to lower coal cost and a tariff hike last year, analysts said it might be needing cash for its new power plants, hence potentially capping its dividend payout.  \nthe edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and

closing down under the automatic price mechanism putrajaya uses to fix the retail price of petrol and diesel, pkr said, noting that at current pump prices, retailers would have racked up losses of up to rm15,000. they would have to bear this loss for the rest of the month, and run the risk of having it snowball into larger amounts of debt owing to the higher price they paid to petrol companies, pkr secretary-general rafizi ramli said yesterday. the pandan mp said that petrol station operators are exposed to losses when oil prices go down because they buy their stocks of petrol and diesel at a higher price. oil companies like petronas, shell, petron and bhp have set that every petrol station buys stock that is at least three days worth of their sale at any time, he said at a press conference at the party headquarters in petaling jaya. they would have to pay for the stock at market price minus the commission, which is 12 sen for petrol and 7 sen for diesel set by the government. he said about 70% of some 5,000 petrol stations throughout malaysia were small- or medium-sized, and sell an average of 500,000 litres of fuel every month. this would generate rm40,000 to rm50,000 in revenue based on the petrol and diesel commissions set by the government. and from that amount, dealers would have to pay utility bills, rental to oil companies, salaries of workers and other charges. with these costs factored in, petrol station operators gain a net profit of rm5,000 to rm10,000 every month, rafizi said. the pkr vice-president also noted that these operators would also have to keep a huge amount of reserve money to buy the three-day stock. so when the petrol price came down on jan 1, they automatically lost between rm10,000 and rm15,000 because their stock, which was bought at a higher price, could now be sold at only rm1.91. taking into account their net profit, which is rm5,000 to rm10,000, and the losses incurred in just one day (rm10,000 to rm15,000), [it] means that they will be making losses that month. if this continues, many petrol station operators are facing the risk of closure. rafizi said the government had made a rash decision to cut fuel subsidies without studying the effect on the people and other stakeholders. without subsidies as the balancing figure, the prices of petrol will keep going down or up, and the changes in prices represent financial risks to the operators. rafizi also said consumers were still paying 30 sen to 40 sen more than what they should be paying for petrol and diesel, based on world market prices, and called on putrajaya to implement a system that would be fair to all.  the malaysian insider this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on january 8, 2015."}, "194": {"date_posted": "2/1/2015", "title":

prices are in a new trading era of us$70 to u$80 per barrel. this is in stark contrast to the past two years, when o&g was the economys star sector. on the flipside, there are bargain o&g stocks to be picked up on bursa malaysia. valuations may be even more attractive should there be a few more rounds of selling before the dust settles. last monday alone, bursa saw at least rm16.52 billion of market capitalisation in o&g stocks evaporate after the organization of the petroleum exporting countries (opec) decided not to cut production. petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) president and ceo tan sri shamsul azhar abbas remark about cutting the national oil firms capex for next year added weight to the plunge. the sharp fall in o&g stocks caused the fbmklci to tumble 2.34% to 1,778.27 points, its worst drop since jan 18, 2013. all 37 companies with core businesses related to the o&g industry fell, some by double-digit percentages. offshore drilling service providers saw the heaviest fall last monday. umw oil & gas corp bhd lost 17.67% of its value to end at rm2.33, while perisai petroleum teknologi bhd shed 19.26% to 54.5 sen. an analyst says petronas capex cut could negatively impact exploration and drilling players. since october this year, sapurakencana petroleum bhd has lost rm9.71 billion of market cap; bumi armada bhd, rm4.87 billion; dialog group bhd, rm1.77 billion; petronas dagangan bhd rm3.06 billion; and umw oil & gas bhd, rm2.94 billion. as the o&g operating environment becomes tougher, companies with strong balance sheets and clear earnings visibility over the next three years will tend to stand out. in fact, there is still activity in the sector. last friday, sapurakencana announced it had obtained eight contracts and contract renewals worth rm1.58 billion from various clients. the recent selldown has pushed o&g counters to a level of price-earnings multiples not seen since the global financial crisis in 2009. were not in another financial crisis, for sure. now, the depressed prices are due to oversupply, and theyre much higher than during the last crisis. looking at the historical valuations, o&g stocks were traded at eight to nine times their price-earnings ratio, says an insurance fund manager. after the onset of the global credit crunch in september 2008, crude oil prices plunged from a peak of us$146.08 to us$40. by comparison, brent was traded at us$69.15 per barrel, and wti, at us$66.30 per barrel, at the time of writing last friday. alliancedbs research analyst arhnue tan tellsthe edgethat she is now valuing big-cap o&g stocks target prices at forward price-earnings ratios in the mid-teens, while mid-caps are ascribed price-earnings multiples in the low-teens. these valuations are at least 40% lower than the forward 20 times price-earnings ratios (or more) that o&g stocks used to command. however, alliancedbss current band of earnings multiples is still higher than the range seen during the global financial crisis. analysts and fund managers also say that downstream players could be less affected by depressed oil prices. one name in the subsector that comes to mind is dialog. there might be higher volumes of oil stored at dialogs pengerang independent deepwater petroleum terminal when prices are lower, says a fund manager. however, an analyst says that it might be premature to say so, as it all hinges on demand for oil. bloomberg data, however, shows that analysts still favour dialog, with nine of 17 recommending a buy at an average target price of rm1.71. the counter closed at rm1.35 last friday. while fund managers and analysts think there could be buying opportunities in some of the battered blue chips, they say it might take at least six months for investors sentiment on the o&g industry to recover, so long as oil prices have stabilised. it is still unclear what contract flows will be like next year. the upstream players that rely mostly on petronas projects could be badly hurt. once oil prices recover to us$70 or above (petronas production cost is estimated at us$65 a barrel), investors might warm up again to o&g stocks. right now, its just too unpredictable to look into a lot of the mid-caps, a fund manager says. rhb research institute projects that brent crude could fall to as low as us$60 in the next six months. however, it estimates that the price could recover to between us$90 and us$100 per barrel in 12 to 24 months. big-cap sapurakencana is the top recommendation of o&g analysts given its depressed valuations. after losing more than 20.06% in market value in just four weeks, sapurakencana was traded at a forward price-earnings multiple of 10.64 times, according to blommberg. sapurakencana has an order book value of rm26.8 billion, equivalent to 3.2 times its fy2014 revenue. sapurakencana vice-chairman tan sri mokhzani mahathir bought three million shares last week in a move seen by o&g bulls as a sign of confidence in the group. the same could be said for bumi armada, which fell to an all-time low of 98 sen last monday. although hassan basma, who stepped down as ceo last friday, had been trimming his stake in the fifth-largest floating production and storage offloading (fpso) provider in the world, former deputy chairman datuk ahmad fuad md ali and datuk abdul farish abd rashid bought more bumi armada shares after the o&g rout last monday. bumi armada has declined by 57.5% to date this year. in a note, midf research says that bumi armadas order book stood at rm21.8 billion, with extension options amounting to rm11.8 billion. we believe bumi armada will be able to weather the storm as the large portion of its order book consists of fixed long-term fpso contracts with extension options and only 9% consists of osv contracts, the research house said. in the first nine months of its financial year ending dec 31, 2014, bumi armadas net profit of rm271.25 million was 20.89% lower year-on-year. in an earlier interview withthe edge, hassan explained that the drop was due to a change in the accounting treatment of the companys assets, from operating lease to finance lease, since the beginning of this year. the change means earnings from its fpso business are recognised progressively. in a note last thursday, alliancedbss tan said dayang enterprises sole focus on the offshore brownfield segment shields the company from volatility in crude oil prices. dayang enterprises earnings will remain resilient even during periods of weak crude oil prices.this is because brownfield activities would be ongoing to sustain offshore production. to recap, the groups earnings were also resilient during the 2008/09 financial crisis. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on

sluggish and the ringgit continues to weaken against the us dollar. in a strategy note jan 2, the research house said foreign selling would re-emerge whenever there was a concern on the slump in oil

standard deviation above its historical mean of 15x for current pe and u20130.25 standard deviation below its mean for forward pe, it said. the research house foresees the domestic economic outlook for 2015 to remain challenging as tumbling oil prices could derail the governments budget deficit target of 3% of gdp for 2015 (based on oil price of us$100/barrel under government projection). this is because reduction in government coffers may outweigh the savings on subsidies, since oil revenue make up 30% of national income and the soon-to-be-implemented gst is yet to contribute significantly to total revenue in 2015, it said. furthermore, the shrinking current account surplus would continue and possibly turn into deficit in the coming months, no thanks to the slump in commodities' prices. hence, our concern on downgrade of sovereign credit rating will expedite the outflow of foreign funds from our bond and equity markets, it said. jf apex also foresees a slew of downside risks which could derail its \"still positive\" view on the equity market or even trigger a \"bear market\", in light of the following developments: a) spillover effect of russias crisis and geopolitical tensions re-emerging in ukraine b) exodus of foreign funds from emerging markets due to depreciation of asian currencies c) sharper-than-expected fall in china's economic growth d) doubtful economic recovery of japan and eu which relate to the effectiveness of abenomics and ecbs monetary stimulus e) significant slowdown in domestic gdp growth as a result of decline in export and local consumption coupled with possible downgrade of sovereign rating pursuant to a \"twin deficit.  jf apex said investors should adopt a combination of defensive and active investment strategy by investing in undervalued stocks, either small cap or mid and large cap stocks, with positive newsflow and brighter earnings prospects, in addition to the high yield stocks with resilient business models which are unfazed by the downturn in economic growth. it is recommending this instead of a passive investment strategy as it believes the key component index-linked counters such as banking, telco, plantation, oil and gas

lows  but for risk-on investors, there is still value to be found in the sector with valuations becoming more attractive and dividend yields rising. one of the o&g-related stocks that reflect such value is apb resources bhd, an established process equipment fabricator involved mainly in the petrochemical, oleochemical and energy sectors. unlike the tough outlook for vessel operators in the offshore segment of the o&g industry, apb is said to be well insulated as it produces pressure vessels, heat exchangers and heat recovery steam generators  equipment that will be needed in the ongoing refinery and petrochemical integrated development (rapid) project in pengerang, johor. according to analysts, national oil company petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) is unlikely to cut its commitment to rapid despite the current low oil price environment. apb has fallen 34.62% from its 52-week high of rm1.56 on aug 5. at its rm1.03 close last friday, however, the stock was still 13% higher year to date, had a market capitalisation of rm114.2 million and was trading at 9.3 times its historical earnings of rm12.19 million or 11 sen a share in its financial year ended sept 30, 2014. the stock is also trading well below the sum-of-parts valuation of rm2.07 ascribed by hong leong investment banks analyst jason tan yat teng. apbs net assets per share stood at rm1.61 in fy2014. since the company was listed on bursa malaysia in may 2004, it has been delivering uninterrupted profits and consistently paying a dividend of 6.5 sen per share, except in fy2011 when it paid three sen per share. in fy2014, apb declared a first interim dividend of 3.5 sen per share in may, followed by a final dividend of three sen per share. its closing price of rm1.03 last friday translates into a historical dividend yield of 6.31%, making it one of the few o&g stocks to give a decent dividend return. by comparison, the dividend yield of its peers cb industrial product holding bhd and boilermech holdings bhd, among others, stood at 2.26% and 0.91% respectively. note that the valuation ascribed by tan of hong leong investment bank was published on july 31, when brent crude oil price was still at a high level of us$106.80 per barrel. since then, brent has tumbled 33.99% and closed at us$70.50 per barrel last friday. tan tells the edge that the downstream segment of the o&g industry is not expected to be as badly affected by low crude oil prices as the upstream segment. apbs fortunes depend on whether it will get contracts from petronas for the rapid project. while the group is not directly bidding for any part of the project, it could benefit from subcontracts, especially on the process equipment side. he notes in a dec 1 report that while petronas ceo tan sri shamsul azhar abbas has declared that the national oil company may cut capital expenditure by 15% to 20% next year amid low oil prices, the us$27 billion rapid project, which has received final investment decision, is unlikely to be affected by the spending cut.  the view that the downstream segment of the o&g industry might be insulated from the bearish crude oil prices is shared by other local analysts, many of whom have upgraded their recommendations on the relevant players. mohshin aziz, an o&g analyst with maybank investment bank, was among the first to upgrade petronas chemicals group bhd, the bellwether of malaysias petrochemical industry, to a buy from a hold last thursday. the petrochemical market is in a balanced state and everyone is behaving rationally. despite what is happening to crude oil prices, this industry is not in a state of panic or crisis, he says in a dec 4 report. industry observers say the stable outlook for the downstream segment, especially in the petrochemical industry, will prop up process equipment manufacturers, including apb. demand for process equipment is going to be stable next year, says tan. besides supplying process equipment to the petrochemical industry, apb also operates in the oleochemical industry, which, according to apb chairman, managing director and largest shareholder yap kow @ yap kim fah, has greatly helped the group ride out the downturn in fabrication demand in the past few years. in the coming years, the group should benefit from increasing capital expenditure due to rapid expansion of oil palm acreage and demand for oleochemical end-products, particularly in asia, states yap in the groups 2013 annual report. on the operations side, apbs order book stood at rm70 million the last time tan of hong leong investment bank got in touch with the group in july. this should sustain apb for at least nine months, he states in his report. we understand that the contract duration for process equipment is relatively short  from six to nine months. past track records suggest that order book replenishment rate will offset the contract burn rate and sustain revenue going forward. judging from the groups fy2014 results, with net profit up 17.6% to rm12.2 million year on year, apb is doing well operationally. it undertook higher-margin contracts in the final quarter ended sept 30. as a result, 4qfy2014 revenue declined 19.5% to

petroleum bhds dominance in the local market) and weaker domestic oil and gas capital expenditure (capex). the oil and gas industry website upstream reported last friday that hyundai heavy industries is close to securing a us$1 billion (rm3.49 billion) engineering, procurement and fabrication contract for the central processing platform for the baram delta gas gathering project 2 (bardegg 2) and baronia enhanced oil recovery project off malaysia. this contract, if awarded to hyundai, will mark the south koreans second major malaysia contract win this year. in june 2014, the group secured a turnkey contract from hess corp to build a large central processing platform under the north malay basin gas and condensate development. sapurakencana, another major upstream engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (epcc) player, fared reasonably well in the domestic fabrication space this year. in june this year, this group secured us$415 million engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning (epcic) contracts for the construction and installation of three remote wellhead platforms for north malay basin and four wellhead platforms for jda block b-17 and b17-01 field development. in addition, in december 2014 the group secured an rm480 million epcc contract for the baronia and tukau wellhead platforms and rm140 million epcc contract for the angsi compression module. meanwhile, mhb is losing out to its competitors. the group has secured a mere rm323 million worth of contracts year-to-date (ytd), significantly lower than its rm1.7 billion to rm2.9 billion contract wins in 2011 to 2013. the contract awards to the south korean yards signal that petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) is now highly focused on cost control while sapurakencanas strong performance this year could be due to its integrated operation and strong management team. while we expect mhb to secure some rm1.2 billion to rm1.5 billion worth of contracts per year in 2015/16, we opine that its bids will need to be highly competitive, hence its profit margins may come under pressure. in the first half of this year, mhb undertook a mutual separation scheme involving 100 employees. we understand that technip malaysia, mhbs strategic technical and project partner, is also undertaking a rightsizing exercise, signalling that the industry downturn and its impact on the joint venture may be more pronounced than we expected. our economist has recently lowered our 2015e brent crude price forecast to us$75 per barrel from us$85 per barrel on the large global oil production surplus and the organisation of the oil producing countries decision not to intervene in the oil market. the lower oil price has pressured petronas to cut its 2015 capex by 15% to 20%. mhb, a domestic oil and gas company with single business focus, is vulnerable to lower domestic upstream capex. in view of the increasingly competitive domestic fabrication landscape and possible project delays due to uncertain oil price outlook, we have lowered our 2015/16e earnings per share forecast by 5% to 10%, imputing a lower new contract wins assumption of rm350 million for 2014e from rm500 million previously, and rm1.2 billion for 2015e from rm1.5 billion. we maintain our sell rating with a lower target price of rm1.15 from rm1.50, pegging the stock at 12 times 2015 price-earnings ratio ([per] from 15 times). our target per of 12 times is comparable to -1 standard deviation per of 11.5 times. we opine that the potential entrance of a south korean yard will permanently change the local fabrication landscape, pressuring margins and reducing the appeal of mhb. also, mhbs weak ytd contract wins, low order book backlog and the weak oil price will further weigh down its share

sapurakencana petroleum bhd of interests in several oilfields in vietnam from petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) is seen favourably by analysts in the oil and gas sector, who say the price tag of us$400 million (rm1.3 billion) is attractive even in a low oil price environment. in an announcement last week, the group says it had proposed to acquire a 50% stake in blocks 01/97 and 02/97 (known as cuu long basin), 36.8% in block 46-cn (cai nuoc), and 40% in blocks 10 and 11.1 (nam con son basin). the first two are oil and gas producing blocks while the third is an exploration block. petronas is said to have put its stakes in the three blocks up for sale earlier this year. after the international bidding exercise, sapurakencana entered into three conditional sales and purchase agreements with the national oil firm with regard to the assets. the vietnam assets are estimated to have further upside as sapurakencana will be able to ramp up production in the fields located in cuu long basin as well as potentially make discoveries in the exploration field at nam con son basin. sapurakencana president and group ceo tan sri shahril shamsuddin says in a statement that the transaction gives the group an immediate foothold in the promising oil provinces off the shores of vietnam, with cash generating assets that will be earnings accretive to the group. he adds that the acquisition of interests in the three blocks marks a significant milestone for the group as it further strengthens its presence in vietnam by adding exploration and production operations to its existing service operations. the values of the assets were first estimated by wood mackenzie, a firm that assesses oil blocks. in july, wood mackenzie released a report assessing the worth of only two fields in one of the blocks in the aforementioned vietnam assets. the firm estimated that the thang long and dong do fields located in block 01/97 and 02/97 will contribute total company cash flow of about us$480 million across a period of 12 years (from 2014 to 2025). the production sharing contract (psc) concession for this block ends in 2028. however, the us$480 million, which will be pocketed by sapurakencana, is only half of the deal. the cuu long basin, where the thang long and dong do fields are located, also has another field called ho xam south. wood mackenzie did not take into consideration ho xam south or the other two blocks  cai nuoc and nam con son basin  since at the time of publication, the fields were either not producing or did not have concrete details. the cuu long basin appears to be the gem in the asset as it has three oil-producing fields  thang long, dong do and ho xam south. the fields were producing about 8,800 barrels of oil per day (bopd) in september and have total reserves of about 43 million barrels. in 2015, production is expected to be ramped up to 18,000 bopd. as for cai nuoc, it is a smaller field with less production. it is currently producing about 900 bopd and 23 million standard cu ft per day of gas. the field has been producing since 2003 and the psc will expire in august 2015. an extension is subject to negotiation between sapurakencana and vietnams national oil firm petrovietnam. meanwhile, the potential discoveries and production of nam con son basin, which is an exploration field, are yet unknown, although some prospects have been identified. assuming that sapurakencana makes a discovery, it could add more worth to the total asset. the acquisition of the vietnam assets contributes further to sapurakencanas already increasing reserves and resources. at the start of the year, sapurakencana had reserves and resources of about 104 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe). after the five discoveries in sk408 announced in september, its reserves doubled to 208 mmboe. the integration of the vietnam assets will now see sapurakencana having total reserves and resources of 225 mmboe. additionally, since the vietnam assets are already producing oil, sapurakencana is also expected to see its cash flow increase with time. according to kenanga researchs cezzane see, the vietnamese acquisition has producing assets, hence will translate into immediate cash flow that will be utilised to pay off the borrowings that come with the acquisition, which is 100% debt financed. from a balance sheet perspective, see says the borrowings for the vietnam fields will spur net gearing, but sapurakencana is certain that payback will be swift given strong cash flows from the producing assets. see has given the stock an outperform rating with a target price of rm4.24. maybank ib research is of the view that the vietnam blocks are quality assets as they are in production, and has given the stock a buy recommendation and a target price of rm3.80. in a research report, it says the assets offer immediate cash flows and earnings visibility of about us$200 million earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) per annum over the next seven years. sapurakencanas share price closed at rm3.11 last friday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm18.64 billion. previously, petronas vietnam assets were speculated to have attracted big names such as tycoon ananda krishnans pexco group and tan sri mokhzani mahathir. in the may 22 issue of the edge, sources said that ananda was mulling over the listing of pexco on bursa malaysia, should he acquire petronas assets in vietnam. pexco is owned by anandas privately held flagship, usaha tegas sdn bhd.

"title": "trade wise: what petronas licences mean to yinson", "article": " as many expect the local oil and gas market to see lacklustre newsflow due to falling crude prices, yinson holdings bhds licence awards from petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) have been a surprise. last week, yinson announced to bursa malaysia that petronas had given its 30%-owned associate company, yinson energy sdn bhd (yesb), three licences.  they are for floating offshore facilities (swec sf2010000), mobile offshore facilities (swec sf2020000) and naval architecture and marine engineering (swec se2010500).  earlier this year, the potential licence awards were seen as a catalyst for yinson to participate more in the domestic oil and gas industry. globally, it is the sixth largest fpso (floating production, storage and offloading) player in terms of fleet size. it has been active in vietnam and west africa but not on the home front as it did not have a petronas licence to bid for jobs. however, the current depressed oil and gas market may see its development plan being shelved for the time being. to make things worse, brent crude fell to its lowest level in four years last friday, closing at us$77 per barrel.  in tandem with the falling oil prices, yinsons share price has been declining, falling 12% from rm2.96 on oct 30 to last fridays close of rm2.60. the stock hit a peak of rm3.47 in september. at rm2.60, yinsons market capitalisation was rm2.71 billion or at a forward price-earnings ratio (per) of nearly 23 times, according to bloomberg. the rich per is said to be backed by anticipated earnings growth in the financial years ending jan 31, 2016 (fy2016) and fy2017, after it has realised the full potential of its current fleet of fpsos. still, with oil prices below us$80 per barrel, analysts do not see the petronas licences doing yinson much good in the near term. an industry analyst tells the edge that the tumbling crude prices will cause oil companies to cut back on exploration, thus reducing the need for fpsos. only when new fields are discovered and enter the production phase will there be a need for new deployment of fpsos. further, he points out that new fpso contracts will likely have depressed rates because oil companies are expected to squeeze the rates for their internal rate of return (irr). amresearchs wong joe vuei, who has a hold on yinson and a fair value of rm2.97, also does not expect much from the petronas licences in the near term. we do not expect yinson to secure jobs within malaysia anytime soon as project rollouts have been delayed or have slowed down recently amid the low oil prices. we note that bumi armada bhd, which is the fifth largest fpso player globally, is not operating any fpso vessel in malaysia currently. wong points out that a more attractive catalyst for yinson is its ongoing bids for overseas projects. catalysts for the group stem from additional fpso contracts, which the group is currently bidding for, in west africa and southeast asia. nevertheless, the petronas licences will open up new opportunities for yinson on the home front. apart from allowing the company to bid for petronas jobs, the licences will also serve as strong credentials for the group, say analysts. yesb was incorporated in september last year. it has an authorised share capital of rm100,000 and its initial issued and paid-up capital is rm1,000. the companys principal activities include the provision of marine vessels for charter and marine services. according to a filing with the companies commission of malaysia, yinson holds 30% equity interest in yesb while two individuals, rozlan md taha and iftisham abdul aziz, hold a 35% stake each. rozlan and iftisham are also directors of yesb, together with mat sin bidin, choke yoon chuam, tan soo leong, yinson founder and executive chairman lim han weng and yinson executive director bah kim lian. lim is the major shareholder of yinson with a 35.5% stake, followed by tan sri mokhzani mahathirs kencana capital sdn bhd with 18.55% and the employees provident fund (epf) with 5.83%. in view of the falling oil prices, the epf has been trimming its holdings in yinson in the past month. its stake was as high as 6.2% on oct 17. yinson has grown substantially over the past few years and some quarters believe that the group will expand its business in the oil and gas industry further. the game-changing acquisition of fred olsen production (fop) in june last year marked a turning point for the group. currently, yinson has an order book of us$3.7 billion (rm7.8 billion), which is expected to last it until 2023. the group, having leveraged fred olsens established presence in west africa, is also the leading contender for a us$700 million to us$800 million offshore cape three points (octp) fpso project off the coast of ghana. after the acquisition of fred olsen, yinson has grown immensely. in its financial year ended jan 31, 2014 (fy2014), the group doubled its net profit to rm69.8 million from rm36.3 million in fy2013. revenue nearly breached the rm1 billion mark at rm941.9 million in fy2014 from rm865.2 million in fy2013 while total assets grew to rm2.1 billion from rm800.9 million. in terms of fleet size, yinson is just three vessels behind bumi armada. in malaysia, bumi armada is the largest fpso player with

were mixed on its prospects going foward given the challenging outlook for the oil and gas industry. some analysts, while reiterating their buy calls on the counter, noted that the contract wins were within their assumptions, and thus maintained their earnings forecasts. meanwhile, others revised the target price of skpetro downwards. at 11.56 am, skpetro was up 1 sen or 0.40% at rm2.52, with some 5.6 million shares traded. the stock stood as the top 30 active on bursa malaysia as at writing time. amresearch in a note today maintained its buy call on skpetro, but lowered its fair value of the counter to rm3.20 (from rm4.80) u2013 based on a lower forecasted fy15 price to earnings ratio (per) of 12 times (versus 18 times previously). we maintain our forecasts for now as these contracts are within our current estimates. we have currently assumed rm9 billion-rm12 billion in new order assumptions annually for fy15f-fy17f, said analyst wong joe vuei, however adding that the challenging outlook of the industry, amid the lower crude oil price environment and oil companies cutting capex. wong said the groups outstanding orderbook, which now stands at rm28 billion (2.4 times of its forecasted fy16 revenue), remains the largest within the oil and gas (o&g) sector and above bumi armadas firm orders of rm22 billion. meanwhile, midf research also lowered its target price for skpetro to rm3.70 (from rm4.86), citing weak global crude oil price coupled with petronas capex cut have resulted in a widespread valuation de-rating among the local o&g companies. it nonetheless still advocates a buy on the stock. hence we are de-valuing skpetro with a revised per16 of 16x. our revised target per16 is one standard deviation lower than its rolling four-quarter average per of 25x, said analyst aaron tan wei min. elsewhere, rhb research views the contract wins positively, noting that the group had again demonstrated its ability to be competitive in both domestic jobs and overseas jobs. we had already assumed a conservative 9% drop in orderbook replenishment and a 10% softening in day rates of its tender rigs. we believe it is materially exposed to risks of global capex rationalisation, given that current oil prices could defer and delay many unfeasible new projects, said analyst kong ho meng. rhb research maintains its buy call on skpetro, implying a 16 times forecasted fy16 per. however, it highlighted a worst stress test scenario, where assuming brent crude goes below us$ 70 per barrel, a 25% cut in tender rig day rates and an absence of pipelay long-term contracts from brazil, will lead to a target price of rm1.99.

yard  is almost idle, and its other sizeable asset, a floating production, storage and offloading (fpso) vessel that is being refurbished, is only likely to generate earnings in the latter half of 2016. in a nutshell, if thhe does not bag a reasonably large fabrication job by the first quarter of next year, the group could be in some serious trouble as it only has some rm300 million worth of work left at the 60-acre fabrication yard in pulau indah. against this backdrop, much of thhes fortunes hinges on the us$1 billion central processing platform (cpp) job for the baronia oil field off the coast of sarawak by state-controlled petroliam nasional bhd (petronas). however, judging by reports in international oil and gas publications, south koreas hyundai heavy industries (hhi) seems to be the front runner for the cpp project, edging out thhe and its partner mcdermott international inc. in an exclusive interview with the edge (see below), thhes managing director and ceo nor badli munawir mohamad alias lafti did not mince his words when explaining how important the baronia cpp is to thhe. its critical in the sense that by june next year, our fabrication yard will be completely zero u2026 our yard will be zero. if you were to walk into our yard now, its [nearly] empty. at present, thhes main fabrication contract is the rm250 million kinabalu non-associated gas (nag) topside project, which is due for completion in the third quarter of next year. thus, thhe has to bag the baronia cpp job or risk going through a quiet patch, as the next large-scale job from petronas is the sepat cpp, which is likely to be awarded only in the third quarter of next year. of petronas five cpp jobs that are up for grabs under its last capital expenditure plan, two  sk-316 and bergading  have been awarded. sk-316 went to a joint venture between malaysia marine and heavy engineering holdings bhd (mmhe) with technip and bergading went to hhi. as for the third cpp job, baronia, which is likely to be awarded soon, hhi is said to be the favourite to get it. it is only after baronia has been awarded that petronas will look at the cpps for sepat and kasawari. for thhe, its partnership with us-based mcdermott has not been fruitful, as possibly three out of five petronas jobs have slipped their fingers. to recap, in late 2012, thhe inked an agreement with mcdermott under which thhe acquired a 30% stake in berlian mcdermott sdn bhd while mcdermott took up a 30% stake in th heavy engineering fabricators sdn bhd. both deals were valued at an identical us$24.5 million each. berlian mcdermott is a company licensed to provide transportation and carry out installation for the oil and gas sector. it also owns a pipe-laying barge known as the db30. th heavy engineering fabricators is a licensed petronas fabricator. however, the main thrust of the partnership with mcdermott was to bag cpp and related jobs. thhes other asset, the fpso dubbed the deep producer 1 (formerly the 68,000 deadweight tonnage tanker mv laurita), was acquired in july 2011 as a distressed asset at a cost of us$82.5 million  about 40% of the us$200 million the previous owners spent building the vessel. however, the fpso was not bought with a locked-in charter contract and only secured a rm1.2 billion job in may this year from jx nippon oil & gas exploration (m) ltd for works in the layang development project located in block sk10, off the coast of sarawak. the fpso cost thhe about rm2 million a month to sustain when it was unchartered. however, now that it has secured a contract, the deep producer 1 is set to undergo a us$150 million to us$180 million conversion exercise so that it can be used in a gas field. therefore, the fpso will only start generating revenue in the latter half of 2016. some analysts have downgraded thhes stock recently. for instance, alliance dbs research says, thhes earnings outlook for fy2015 is becoming increasingly challenging as order flow has been slow u2026 as such, we lower our new order win assumptions for fy2015 by rm200 million to rm500 million with the increasingly competitive landscape. this leads us to cut fy2015-16 forecast earnings by 18% to 26%. with the cut in earnings estimates, alliance dbs lowered its sum-of-parts-based target price to 65 sen from 95 sen previously. th heavy closed last thursday at 59 sen, with a market capitalisation of rm677.6 million. alliance dbs forecasts thhe raking in rm21 million in net profit from rm385 million in revenue for fy2014. for the six months to june this year, thhe suffered a net loss of rm4.5 million from revenue of rm206.8 million. nor badli explains that the operating environment has become increasingly challenging, with the number of licensed fabricators increasing from six to eight after petronas awarded licences to sarawak-based kkb engineering bhd and muhibbah engineering (m) bhd in 2013. of the other six fabrication players  other than sapurakencana petroleum bhd  five are glcs. they are brooke dockyard sdn bhd, boustead heavy industries corp bhd, labuan shipyard & engineering sdn bhd, mmhe and thhe. despite the large number of glcs, petronas has been standing firm, awarding jobs hinged on nothing but price, which has not gone down well with many. petronas is the hand that feeds us, so we will just have to take it one step at a time. its like being punched but you still [have to] keep your chin up. theres nothing much we can do. (but) i wish petronas had a different kind of policy, in which they allow foreign bidders to come, but gives priority to locals. so, if price is the criteria, perhaps get the locals to match it. give us first right of refusal, nor badli says. since tan sri shamsul azhar abbas took over the helm of petronas as president and ceo in february 2010, the national oil firm has changed its approach. it stopped allocating fabrication jobs only to local players after it found that they had been overcharging the company by as much as 30%. because of this overcharging, petronas changed the mode. now we dont overcharge and we dont get the jobs [either], nor badli says. thhe, like many other disgruntled industry players, blames petronas for its ailing financials  but the oil major is unlikely to change its emphasis on costs any time soon.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on november 10 - 16, 2014."}, "216": {"date_posted": "4/12/2014", "title": "cimb research maintains add on muhibbah, lowers target price to rm3.40 ", "article": " kuala lumpur (dec 4): cimb research has maintained its add rating on muhibbah engineering bhd at rm2 with a lower target price of rm3.40 (from rm3.64) and said that amidst the negativity surrounding the fall in crude oil price, muhibbah managed to throw out good news, announcing yesterday that it had clinched a wharf expansion contract from westports. in a note thursday,the research house said this supported muhibbah management's guidance that the group had been actively tendering for port/marine infra jobs, which is its niche area. all eyes will next be on potential contract wins in rapid and pengerang, two areas that will not be affected by petronass potential capex cuts as they have received the final investment decision (fid). we maintain our eps forecasts but reduce our target price, still pegged to a 20% rnav discount, as we update for favelle's lower market cap. the stock remains oversold. maintain add. muhibbah is our small/mid-cap pick, it said."}, "217": {"date_posted": "3/12/2014", "title": "th heavy falls 5% after edge fd reports co retrenching staff", "article": " kuala lumpur (dec 3): th heavy engineering bhd dipped as much as two sen or 5% to 38 sen after the edge financial daily (edge fd) reported that the company is retrenching workers. at 10.55am, some five million shares changed hands. edge fd, quoting th heavy's memorandum, reported that the firm had cut its workforce effective last monday (dec 1) in order to withstand the current headwinds in the oil and gas (o&g) industry. the retrenchment comes amid tumbling crude oil prices on oversupply concerns. the price trend does not augur well for o&g support services providers such as th heavy, which has failed to secure enough contracts to weather the possible slowdown in the industry. national oil company petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) had last friday announced a cut in capital expenditure by 15% to 20%. it was reported that th was retrenching selected employees that were hired in anticipation of clinching at least one fabrication job from petronas in either the baronia oil field or bergading central processing platform. th failed to secure the bergading project and it was reported that the company would likely fall out of the race to get the baronia job.

secured contracts should be able to weather the possible slowdown in the industry. kenanga research believes that certain oil and gas (o&g) stocks offer good bottom-fishing opportunities as values have started to emerge even after earnings downgrades. its picks are dayang enterprise holdings bhd, barakah offshore petroleum bhd, perdana petroleum bhd and sapurakencana petroleum bhd. kenanga research has ruled out the possibility of crude oil hitting us$40 (rm137) to us$50 per barrel as per market talks. this is because our simulation study reveals that the probability for it dipping below us$60 per barrel is remote with a probability of less than 10%, it added. alliancedbs research analyst arhnue tan said earnings of o&g companies had met expectations in the recently concluded results season for the quarter ended sept 30. she expects corporate fourth-quarter (4q) earnings to remain intact as most of the companies have secured contracts which will be realised in 4q14. our earlier forecast on the o&g sector remains unchanged in the short term, tan told the edge financial daily yesterday. nonetheless, she noted that she is still working on the new valuations for the sector for 2015 in view of the plunge in oil prices. tan is advising investors to pick stocks that have strong fundamentals or heavily sold down o&g stocks such as sapurakencana petroleum, dialog group bhd and bumi armada bhd to capitalise on the recent sharp decline in their stock prices. these counters are fairly strong fundamentally and have large order books which may help them to pull through the difficult operating times. furthermore, these counters have a long-term earnings visibility and they are more resilient compared with other counters, she added. but tan remained cautious about the sector as she believes a recovery would not be immediate. as of now, i maintain a neutral rating on the sector as there is no exact time frame for the recovery in crude oil. o&g stocks regained some lost ground yesterday after the heavy selldown on monday. beaten-down shares such as petroliam nasional bhd (petronas)-related stocks led the rebound, with petronas chemical group bhd emerging as the top gainer, up 7.21% to close at the days high of rm5.50 after falling 8.88% or 50 sen the day before. the fbm klci also recovered, rising 0.4% to 1,785.97 points yesterday. according to reuters, brent was unchanged at us$72.54 yesterday, while us crude was down 40 cents to us$68.60 a barrel. in its strategy report yesterday, cimb research head terence wong said it remains positive on the o&g sector, which should be a major winner riding on the economic transformation programme (etp) spending despite the 15% to 20% cutback in petronas spending next year. assuming that our earlier forecast for petronas capital expenditure (capex) in 2015 of rm60 billion (based on its average capex in 2012 and 2013) will be lowered by rm9 billion to rm12 billion to rm48 billion to rm51 billion, this will still be the highest annual capex prior to the implementation of the etp. it also appears that the capex reduction will affect the downstream segment more than upstream, which forms the bulk of petronas net profit and where most of the companies under our coverage operate, said wong. he noted that the companies under cimb researchs coverage are mostly service providers, which are sticking to their growth plans, even eyeing merger and acquisition opportunities as the sluggish market has thrown up attractive valuations. their order books, over the next two years at least, are intact as they are based on committed capex. furthermore, the contractual terms and rates are not tied to oil prices, he said, adding that it maintains an overweight stance on the sector. its top picks are sapurakencana among the big caps and perdana petroleum among the small caps.  this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on december 3, 2014."}, "220": {"date_posted":

civil and mechanical works and fabrication in petroliam nasional bhds refinery and petrochemical integrated development (rapid) project within the pengerang integrated complex in johor, industry sources say. the edge understands that the contract is a part of the spanish companys rm4 billion engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (epcc) job in the refinery and steam cracker component of rapid that was awarded in august this year. if all goes well, muhibbah could seal part of the epcc job before year-end, a source says. there are scant details of the potential award by tu00e9cnicas reunidas but the contract could nudge muhibbahs order book to an all-time high of almost rm2.5 billion. according to kenanga research, muhibbahs outstanding order book stands at rm1.93 billion, comprising rm875 million from construction, rm1.02 billion from its crane division (favelle favco bhd) and rm38 million from its shipyard division. this will keep the group busy until 2016. kenanga, which has a buy recommendation on the group, says muhibbahs year-to-date contract wins amount to rm378 million or 54% of its financial year 2014 (fy2014) new jobs assumption of rm700 million. we reiterate our view that the remaining rm300 million to rm500 million new jobs will be secured by the group before end-fy2014, likely from oil and gas, that is petronas-related projects such as rapid. this indicates that the award of the epcc contract by tu00e9cnicas reunidas is not entirely unexpected. in its notes accompanying its financial results for the first half of this year, muhibbah says, the group, with its experience and track record in the oil and gas sector, is hopeful of securing some of the related oil and gas engineering and construction works from rapid. it is worth noting that muhibbah has bulked up its order book with several contracts secured this year. last month, it won a rm157 million job for the design, construction and completion of phase 1 of the conveyor system facility for the proposed samalaju port project in bintulu, sarawak, from bintulu port holdings bhd. also in september, the company was awarded a two-year, rm100 million contract for the construction, fabrication and installation of the new aroma chemical complex along with relevant facilities for the lemongrass project in kuantan, pahang, by basf petronas chemicals sdn bhd. in august, muhibbah got a rm30 million contract for the fabrication, loadout and seafastening of jackets, piles and appurtenances for a central processing platform to be installed on vestigos tembikai oilfield off the peninsula. in may, it bagged from samsung engineering (m) sdn bhd the rm61.4 million civil and building works for the terengganu gas terminal project. a few months before that, it was awarded a rm30 million steel structure erection job by jgc (m) sdn bhd for petronas lng train 9 project in bintulu.  interestingly enough, muhibbah may be involved in the fabrication aspect of the rapid contract. in june last year, petronas licensed it as an approved supplier for offshore facilities construction-major onshore fabrication. the licence has put muhibbah on a whole new level as it can now bid for and participate in construction and fabrication works for petronas and other major oil companies in the country, which augurs well for its earnings. for the first half of fy2014 ended june 30, muhibbah registered a net profit of rm41.1 million on revenue of rm860.1 million. a year ago, net profit was flat at rm40.5 million, although revenue rose 8.4% from the previous corresponding period. kenanga estimates muhibbahs fy2014 net profit at rm87.4 million and revenue at rm1.62 billion, and has a target price of rm3.55 for the company, which implies a forward price-earnings ratio (per) of 14.6 times fy2015 earnings. this is still within its mid-sized construction peers historical per of 12 to 15 times. muhibbah has not been spared the effects of the recent turbulence in the global stock markets and has been spiralling down like other oil and gas stocks. since hitting its 52-week high of rm3.43 in july this year, muhibbahs shares have fallen 19.8%. the counter closed at rm2.75 last thursday. says kenanga, we continue to like muhibbah for its unique business structure that offers flexibility in infrastructure, marine engineering and oil and gas jobs, the ability to leverage its internationally recognised favelle favco name and long-term earnings visibility backed by stable and growing recurring income from its concessions. this article first appeared in the edge

company yinson energy sdn bhd had been awarded three licences by petronas. the licences would give a new source of income for yinson, which owns a fleet of floating production, storage and offloading

and one mobile offshore production unit with wide geographical presence in west africa, the united states, europe and southeast asia. yinson holdings earnings have grown by leaps and bounds in the

effective oct 2  just a week ahead offriday oct 10stabling of budget 2015  was generally expected by economists and stock market experts. while there are those who think the move could have been better timed, the experts say subsidy rationalisation is inevitable for the government to achieve its 3.5% of gdp budget deficit target for 2014. simply put, without a subsidy cut, the malaysian government is likely to overshoot its projection on expenses for 2014 based on its spending in the first half of this year. in a note following the 20 sen/litre subsidy cut that raised ron95 prices to rm2.30 per litre and diesel to rm2.20 per litre, citi investment researchs wei zheng kit estimates that the fiscal savings from the governments move could be between rm1.8 billion and rm2 billion for 4q2014, higher than his initial estimate of rm0.8 billion. this is given that market prices for ron95 and diesel have fallen from the rm2.73 per litre and rm2.80 per litre assumed when the earlier 20 sen per litre fuel price hike happened on sept 3, 2013. the malaysian government, which is believed to be on track to achieve its budget 2014 deficit target, following the week prior to oct 6s subsidy cut, still needs to spend over rm21 billion to subsidise ron95, diesel and liquefied petroleum gas (lpg) for 2014  a sizeable amount that will better aid the intended recipients in the lower income groups, through a target subsidy scheme. the current unsubsidised market price is rm2.58 per litre for ron95 and rm2.52 per litre for diesel, the domestic trade, cooperatives and consumerism ministry reportedly said. subsidy rationalisation and the implementation of the goods and services tax (gst) fromapril 1, 2015are two main reasons economists expect higher inflation next year and why stock market experts have been looking for winners in a rising inflationary environment for more than a year now. basically, you see rising business costs in a rising inflationary environment, says rhb research institute sdn bhd executive chairman lim chee sing, who is a well-respected economist. in a subdued growth environment  where major world economies are unable to transition from a recovery to an economic boom  corporations, lim says, do not have much pricing power because demand growth is not strong. as a result, margins are being squeezed everywhere, particularly for corporate malaysia. there is a general lack of earnings growth to create new shareholder value for investors, he explains. the key for investment, therefore, is to identify growth stocks that will create value for investors. these are found mainly in mid- to smaller-cap stocks and that is why the fbm small cap index has gone up by 19.3% year-to-date versus -1.3% for the fbm klci benchmark, lim says, adding that earnings growth for these so-called growth stocks can come from the execution of new contracts, capacity expansion or m&as in spite of lower margins. berjaya auto bhd, tambun indah land bhd, matrix concepts holdings bhd, scientex bhd, press metal bhd, eastern & oriental bhd (e&o) and tune ins holdings bhd are a few examples of the kind of stocks lim is referring to. among the bigger-cap stocks, lim says investors should look out for buying opportunities on market weakness. the latter may arise when a particular stock has been oversold for rich valuations that value emerges. lim points out that sapurakencana petroleum bhds stock price has retracted 15.7% year-to-date, bumi armada bhd shares have tumbled 21.4% year-to-date, malaysia airports holdings bhd (mahb) has shed 16.4% year-to-date while guinness anchor bhd is down 18.9% this year. vincent khoo, who heads uob kayhian research in kuala lumpur, also likes bumi armada, which he describes as among the laggards with defensive businesses that investors should look out for. inflation will be an issue to contend with for a period of time [in malaysia] u2026 however, we are going counter against the rest of the world, which is experiencing some deflation, says khoo, who expects details on the implementation of gst and further subsidy rationalisation to hog the limelight at the tabling of budget 2015. expectations are that a targeted subsidy programme, particularly for fuel, will feature in the unveiling this friday (oct 10) of budget 2015, themed accelerating growth, ensuring fiscal sustainability and prospering the rakyat. the new mechanism is likely to segregate the subsidy on ron95 and diesel based on the users individual income versus the current blanket subsidies regime that also subsidises the higher-income group. in light of the rising cost of living and inflationary pressures, particularly on the vulnerable groups, we expect [subsidy rationalisation] to be accompanied by continued and possibly higher cash transfers, a continuation of people-friendly measures such as the affordable housing scheme, khoo tells clients in an oct 1 note. we maintain our view that ample domestic liquidity will continue to support a stretched end-2014 fbmklci target at 1,930 points, which pegs the index at 16.1 times forward earnings, despite peakish valuations and softening economic fundamentals. we also still expect modest outperformance by small/mid-caps, amid the pullback of speculative stocks since the trading volume exceeded seven billion shares onaug 14, and continue to advocate fundamentally-sound small-mid caps with near-term event catalysts, khoo adds. uob kayhians top picks are malaysian resources corp bhd (mrcb), deleum bhd, barakah offshore petroleum bhd, uzma bhd, and skp resources bhd, which it reckons has the potential of capturing new contracts with its potential synergistic merger with sister company tecnic group bhd. the research houses large-cap picks are gamuda bhd, sapurakencana, bumi armada and tenaga nasional bhd. chan ken yew, who heads kenanga research, also cites strong domestic liquidity as among the saving graces for the local equities market following the recent conclusion of an uninspiring 2q2014 corporate earnings reporting season, in which 37.4% of companies under coverage turned in below-par results. this is worse than the 32% in the first quarter of 2014 and 34.4% in 4q2013. while rich market valuations and unexciting earnings growth would cap upside potential for the malaysian market, chan  who has a 1,910 points klci target for 2014 and 1,980 points for end-2015  also reckons downside could be limited and advocates a buy-on-weakness strategy. the easiest way to capitalise on the favourable 4q performance is to identify the year-to-date underperformers for a potential brief rebound due to window dressing activities, chan says, citing sapurakencana and petronas chemicals as examples. while most domestic sectors, especially direct consumer spending driven companies, will be affected by rising inflationary pressures, chan recommends gst beneficiaries and export-driven companies such as malaysian pacific industries and vs industry bhd that could also benefit from a weaker ringgit. he also likes stocks and sectors buoyed by corporate exercise newsflow such as malaysia building society bhd, rhb capital bhd and sime darby bhd that may spin off some units. whether or not these stock picks will turn out to be prescient, whats certain is inflation is set to accelerate in 2015 when the 6% gst is implemented onapril 1, 2015. and given that the government is targeting to bring down its budget deficit to 3% in 2015 and work towards a balanced budget by 2020 while bringing down its debt levels that are near its self-imposed levels of 55% of gdp, experts say the government would likely find it easier to bring down its subsidy bill than its emolument bill that makes up an even larger slice of its operating expenditure. economists at rhb research reckon that the government may even have to look into rationalising other subsidies as well on a gradual pace in order to reduce its operating expenditure. although this may translate to higher inflationary pressure in the short term, it will likely be manageable if it is implemented on a\ngradual basis, the rhb economists wrote in a sept 24 note, pointing out that the rm43.3 billion spent on subsidies accounted for 20.3% of the governments total revenue in 2013. despite an anticipated moderation in 2014, the rhb economists say subsidies remain sizeable and are still uncomfortably high. subsidies only accounted for 2.9% to 7.8% of revenue in 2000 to 2004, compared with an average of 18.4% a year in 2008 to 2013. they forecast inflation to average around 3% to 3.4% in 2014 and expect the government to take steps to reducing gst-driven price inflation, which could increase the burden of debt on consumers. they estimate the overall impact on full-year consumer price index to be 1.5 percentage points based on a 6% gst startingapril 1, 2015, and expect additional items to join the zero-rated list after public feedback. as it is, nearly one-third of the 944 items in the cpi basket will be zero-rated. basic food items such as rice, sugar, salt, flour, cooking oil, lentils, herbs and spices, salted fish, piped water supply, and the first 200 units of electricity per month for domestic consumers are not subject to gst. services not subject to gst include those provided by the government such as the issuance of passports, healthcare, school education, transport services and highway tolls. rhbs inflation forecast is in-line with the 3.3% median inflation forecast for 2014, according to a poll of 21 houses by bloomberg. for 2015, the median forecast rises to 3.5%, with forecasts ranging from credit agricoles 2.5% to nomura securities 5.2%. while higher inflation would hamper consumer sentiment, the government needs to make a tough decision to reduce its subsidies to a more sustainable level. as a whole, while the government is on course to meet its fiscal deficit target, fiscal reforms must continue so as to instill greater confidence of the country managing its public finances and the economy, thereby leading to a potential improvement in the countrys sovereign ratings, the rhb economists add. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on october 6-12, 2014."}, "228": {"date_posted": "28/10/2014", "title": "klci remains in red as select blue chips weigh ",

"#interview* coming launch of pavilion 2 to give ho hup a leg-up", "article": " it will not be long before investors start seeing strong revenue numbers rolling in for ho hup construction co bhd, which had its pn17 status lifted by bursa malaysia two weeks ago. ceo derek wong tells the edge that malton bhd, the companys partner in the 50-acre joint development in bukit jalil, dubbed pavilion 2, has started selling the shopoffices  sales that ho hup can book into its results for its second quarter ending june 30. that will be the maiden quarter in which we will recognise revenue from our jv with malton, he remarks. he did not give a figure, but highlights the fact that the share of revenue ho hup will collect from the jv is as good as a profit because the company does not have to pay for the development of pavilion 2. under the jv agreement, malton is bearing the entire development cost while ho hup is providing the land  carried at only rm55.20 psf in its books  and is entitled to 18% of the projects gross development value (gdv) of an estimated rm4.2 billion. malton, which is controlled by tycoon datuk desmond lim, has yet to officially launch pavilion 2, much less name it, but wong says launches have been planned for the end of the year.  in fact, malton held a preview of the shopoffices in march and april, which saw encouraging response. the first of six blocks of serviced apartments will be launched in the third or fourth quarter.  pavilion 2 comprises shopoffices, offices, a hotel, six blocks of high-rise serviced apartments and a retail mall the size of which could rival mid valley megamalls with two million sq ft of net lettable area. the mall, in which ho hup will hold 18% equity interest for recurring income, is not for sale.  the launch by malton will be successful. this jv project will give constant recurring income to ho hup for the next 8 to 10 years, says wong. in fact, pavilion 2 is the jewel in ho hups crown. three to four years ago, its gdv was said to be only rm2.1 billion, but now, thanks to maltons plan for a huge mall, it has doubled, increasing ho hups share of the project to rm756 million. reflecting the bright prospects for pavilion 2, ho hups total market capitalisation last thursday  comprising the market value of its shares of rm328.5 million (the stock closed at rm1.43), irredeemable convertible preference shares of rm95.2 million and redeemable convertible preference shares of rm75 million  stood at rm499 million. ho hup also has 51 million warrants outstanding with an exercise price of 60 sen each. they closed at rm1.08 last thursday. nevertheless, wong says ho hup has more to offer than pavilion 2  the company is developing 10 acres in bukit jalil that are adjacent to pavilion 2 that do not come under the jv with malton. the gdv for this project could be over rm1 billion. thus far, ho hup has launched projects with a gdv of close to rm400 million, comprising shopoffices, small offices/versatile offices and super corner retail floors with an unbilled amount of rm317.5 million as at the end of april. the launch of a few more blocks of high-rises is also in the works. initial development of the 10 acres has contributed to ho hups profits even before it has recognised any revenue from its jv with malton.  in the first quarter ended march 31, 2014, ho hup posted a net profit of rm11.31 million or 6.66 sen a share on revenue of rm82.42 million. property development contributed rm13.03 million to operating profit, construction rm727,000 and ready mixed concrete rm139,000. wong says the current property market climate is difficult for developers, not because there are no buyers, but because the banks are being very strict with their financing requirements. however, cancellations have been replaced with new bookings, proving that the 10-acre project is doing well, he reckons.  property development is ho hups core business going forward. cash flow from it will be used for future landbanking and working capital for our construction division.  ho hup is also planning to expand its portfolio of construction jobs, which now comprise largely infrastructure contracts in iraq and an integrated army complex in johor. as at april 30, the divisions order book stood at rm591.2 million with an unbilled amount of rm469.9 million. the company has also bid for a rm300 million water treatment plant deal in malaysia and rm3.6 billion worth of jobs overseas. according to wong, ho hups new business model in construction revolves around jvs and partnerships. as the company is stable now, we are being invited to bid for some very interesting projects because of our past track record. [ho hup had participated in major projects like the north-south expressway and the petronas twin towers.]  we havent had any big breakthroughs yet, but we are gearing up and going for key government infrastructure jobs that we would love to be involved in, he says, citing opportunities in pengerang, mrt line 2 and 3, and hydroelectric dam projects in sarawak.  in fact, ho hup has formed a consortium with international players to bid for a hydroelectric dam project in the sarawak corridor of renewable energy. the bid is still in the pre-qualification stage.  as long as we target government-related infrastructure jobs, there is no issue of financing [from banks], says wong.  wong: the launch by malton will be successful. this jv project will give constant recurring income to ho hup for the next 8 to 10 years. on the companys chances of getting the jobs it has bid for, he says, its not easy. if we get them, its a bonus. if we dont get them, we still have iraq, where we are hopeful of getting about us$100 million worth of contracts per year.  on the ready mixed concrete division, wong says the company will continue to operate the business, although its profit contribution is small. its a business we wont let go because its very sentimental to us, having been a source of cash flow in our bad times. in fact, in absolute amounts (revenue), the company intends to grow this segment. with the completion of its financial regularisation exercise, ho hup now has a clean slate with zero borrowings. and with shareholder tussles, legal disputes and pn17 status for almost six years now behind it, the company can look forward to a fresh start. we have many happy shareholders now, says wong, who is also an indirect substantial shareholder of the company. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on may 19 -

february that year  were appointed directors of vastalux. originally we (shapadu) had planned for a reverse takeover of vastalux, but we found out that we were not ready. the good thing is that since

net profit fall 9% to rm22.02 million last year, on lower revenue of rm421.95 million, after failing to secure the pan malaysia offshore transportation and installation contracts. nevertheless, rosthman is confident of achieving a revenue of rm492 million this year, as the company took delivery of two offshore support vessels this month. going forward, he said shapadu energy & engineering could maintain its annual revenue at around rm500 million.  revenue will remain steady for the next two years, mainly contributed by both offshore and onshore construction contracts that we have

year, on lower revenue of rm421.95 million, after failing to secure the pan malaysia offshore transportation and installation contracts. nevertheless, rosthman is confident of achieving a revenue of rm492 million this year, as the company took delivery of two offshore support vessels this month. going forward, he said shapadu energy & engineering could maintain its annual revenue at around rm500 million.  revenue will remain steady for the next two years, mainly contributed by both offshore and onshore construction contracts that we have secured so far. we managed to secure these contracts from various companies such as petronas carigali, exxonmobil, talisman malaysia ltd, petrofac (malaysia-pm304) ltd and jgc corp, he added. shapadu energy & engineering is currently bidding for o&g contracts worth rm3 billion. these are all local contracts. we have no plans to go overseas yet, simply because we are not ready. in order for us to do so, we reckoned we need to find a reputable

rm45.6 billion in 2012. in 2013, petronas' cumulative nine-month capex stood at rm38.4 billion. this shows petronas commitment to address malaysias energy needs, with the lions share of the budget going to the upstream sector, said quah. according to petronas, the capex figures formed part of the national oil company's planned estimated rm300 billion allocation between 2011 and 2015. quah noted that local o&g support-service providers were enjoying record-high order books and strong patronage from petronas. however, the research house professed to being selective with its o&g stock picks, preferring companies with clear earnings visibility, healthy financials and good track records. \"malaysian o&g companies are on the cusp of a strong and visible earnings growth trajectory on the back

quarterly results for o&g companies have disappointed, largely due to rising cost which eroded profitability. we notice that local fabrication players have been affected by slow order book

expects to see at least 10% of its income come from alternative assets, such as real estate and private equity deals, over the next decade to help it continue to deliver good returns on its growing pool of funds, says ceo datuk shahril ridza ridzuan. for this to happen, more money will have to be invested outside the retirement savings managers conventional staple of government bonds and blue chips, and in relatively riskier assets at home and abroad. its global assets doubled in the past three years to reach over rm120 billion or 20.97% of total investment assets as at end-2013. the epf is allowed to invest 23% of its funds outside malaysia and there is a good chance it will hit this ceiling in 2015, if not this year, say experts. without going into the specifics of what the new ceiling for overseas investments should be, shahril, 44, says it will have to gradually go up to give the fund greater flexibility in its investment options.  when emerging markets were being sold down in the second half of 2013, our investments in developed markets worked well for us u2026 gains there helped provided some buffer, he says, explaining how income from the epfs overseas investments is also hedged to protect against currency fluctuations. thats one of the many things we do to give us some level of certainty on the amount of returns we generate. as for the suspicion that the epf supports the local stock market, shahril  who had joined the pension fund in december 2009 as deputy ceo in charge of the investments division before assuming the ceos chair last april  has this to say: there is no particular level that we think the market should be at u2026 for a [large] fund like us, liquidity becomes an issue u2026 managing a rm200 billion fund is very different from managing a rm200 million fund u2026 this is why you will often find that we are a buyer when there are many sellers [in the market] and a seller when there are many buyers.  while it has a long investment horizon, the epf constantly evaluates its portfolio to carry the best holdings because it pays dividends annually from realised income, he explains.  this is why if we think there is not much upside left, we will sometimes accept [lower] offers that we think are a decent price for us to exit at because we cannot get that price in the open market, shahril says when asked about the rationale behind the epfs acceptance of petronas offer for misc bhd that some parties saw as low. shahril: managing a rm200 billion fund is very different from managing a rm200 million fund. this is why the epf is a buyer when there are many sellers and a seller when there are many buyers. he probably would not be surprised to face opposition to the epf putting more money into alternative assets locally and abroad, but prefers to let the results speak for themselves. when the epf flagged the possibility of lower dividends for 2013 due to global volatility, some critics deemed that to be a result of the epf being tapped to support the local equity market as foreigners pulled out from emerging markets, including malaysia.instead, the epf on feb 16 announced another record-high dividend payout  6.35%  which was the highest since the 6.84% announced in 1999. still, after five straight years of dividend growth, even those in favour of the epfs investment diversification wonder if the growth can be sustained as global uncertainties persist. to be sure, with the epfs fund size set to exceed the rm600 billion mark this year, its managers are forced to work harder to deliver at least the targeted minimum annual return of 2% above inflation. total investments had increased from rm341.01 billion as at end-2008 to rm586.66 billion as at end-2013. in line with the growth, to pay 1% dividend to its members, the amount the epf needs has grown by an average 9.12% a year over the past five years from rm3.18 billion in 2008 to rm4.91 billion in 2013. it only needed rm1.68 billion to do the same a decade ago in 2003, when total investments hovered near the rm200 billion mark. higher allocation to equitiesa closer look at the epfs asset allocation over the past five years shows a higher proportion of assets is going into equities while additional investments in fixed income, particularly corporate loans and bonds, has been lower. investments in equities had grown from 25.7% of total investment assets in 2008 to 43% (rm252.14 billion) in 2013, which was up from rm203.9 billion (38.7% of total investments) in 2012 and rm87.9 billion in 2008, data in the epfs annual report shows. by comparison, investments in fixed income (mgs and corporate loans and bonds) had declined to 52.34% in 2013 from 68.25% in 2008, although absolute amounts rose to rm307.1 billion from rm233.4 billion over the period. it should be noted that equities contributed rm19.5 billion or 55.76% to the epfs rm35 billion gross investment income in 2013, up from 34.84% in 2008 when it earned rm6.67 billion. fixed-income investments contributed 39.19% to total investment income last year compared with 61.17% in 2008. the epfs success in equities, which are seen as higher risk assets than quality fixed-income paper, will likely be closely watched.   as it is, the epf, ranked the sixth largest pension fund in asia and the 12th globally by assets under management in 2012 by tower watson, is forced to venture abroad so as to not crowd out other local players and to diversify its portfolio. despite its participation in several high-profile deals  from the u00a38 billion, 15-year battersea power station redevelopment project with s p setia bhd and sime darby bhd to the rm2.28 billion acquisition of rubber research institute land from the government to be turned into the kwasa damansara township  the epf has invested only rm14.4 billion in real estate and other alternative assets so far. thats only 2.45% of its rm586.7 billion total investments as at end-2013 (see tables below).  as for the epfs real estate portfolio in the uk, shahril estimates that its value is likely worth 10% to 15% more today based purely on yield compression because the epf was among the earlier foreign investors in london. when we started three years ago, we could still get yields of 6%.  now, the epf is scouting around for opportunities in countries like the us and japan and is likely to enter markets that it does not know very well with strong partners. in australia, for instance, we have a strong partner in goodman group, says shahril. the epf is also open to lending its financial muscle for a share of real estate that can provide steady income flow in the future, such as malls or office blocks. due to the size of the epfs funds, income generation from these projects is likely to remain small relative to its total income base for some time. nonetheless, the strategy should pay off once some of the larger developments, like battersea and kwasa damansara, where the epf is targeting a stake in retail and commercial buildings, mature. whatever the case, more than 90% of its funds is still invested in fixed-income securities and equities and any increase in the money put into alternative assets, including participation in corporate deals such as the privatisation of plus expressways bhd, kfc holdings (m) bhd and kian joo can factory bhd, will be opportunistic. there is a lot of attention on these projects because of their physical presence u2026 but [even money from land sales] will be small, relatively speaking, shahril points out.  due to its deep pockets, the epf gets deal proposals by the dozens, but only a handful that fit in with its investment and risk appetite go through. weve been shareholders of kian joo for a long time and we think it is a good business that caters for a diversified client base with steady cash flow, says shahril, explaining the epfs preference for businesses with strong cash-flow generation capability.  according to him, the epfs investment panel has a very high threshold for even staple investments like corporate debt paper because of the need to preserve capital while delivering decent growth.  we hold most of our debt paper to maturity [for yields] u2026 we do not buy anything below investment-grade rating, he says, adding that even issuers of a-rated paper are evaluated for their cash flow generation capability and gearing position before an investment is made. he declines comment on whether the epf will take up some of the rm2.4 billion worth of sukuk currently being sold by 1malaysia development bhd (1mdb) to fund the relocation of defence units from the land earmarked for the 196ha bandar malaysia development project. in the long run, once the epf builds a strong track record, as much as 50% of its funds could be invested outside malaysia if thats the best option to deliver growth. for now, shahril knows a lot of work needs to be done to push the epf higher among global peers, but he is confident the results will show that the pension fund is on the right track. as chua hak bin, economist at bank of america-merrill lynch, puts it, some of the domestic capital outflow from malaysia is a structural trend with malaysians or institutions diversifying their holdings. at least three parcels of rri land up for tender this yearat least three parcels of the coveted rubber research institute (rri) land measuring about 130 acres in total will be up for grabs this year, kick-starting the high-profile, 15-year suburban property project that will contribute to the retirement savings of members of the employees provident fund (epf). based on the response weve seen so far, we think well get a bit more than the price were looking for, says the pension funds ceo datuk shahril ridza ridzuan, who, however, declines to disclose the floor price of the plots. tenders will soon be invited for the first parcel of 70 acres, which will house transport infrastructure and facilities, he adds. the other two parcels, one largely for commercial use and the other for residential use, are between 30 acres and 50 acres each.  we want to control the supply of land into the market, says shahril, adding that periodically, smaller plots of land will be put out to tender to allow smaller players to participate. the epfs wholly-owned subsidiary kwasa land sdn bhd is the master developer of the 2,330-acre rri land, which will be developed into a township called kwasa damansara that will be bigger than subang jaya (1,799 acres) and is expected to generate projects worth rm50 billion in gross development value (gdv). kwasa land, which reportedly expects to raise rm11 billion from selling 1,350 acres of the rri land, will take equity in most of the eight precincts available for development. the equity participation will go towards building future income for the epf. as many as 60 developers have reportedly been pre-qualified for the upcoming tender. events are already in motion.  in late january this year, kwasa land sold two parcels in sungai buloh  in the vicinity of kwasa damansara  to pink corner sdn bhd and trc land sdn bhd, who were the highest bidders for the parcels that are said to be at just a stones throw from the main township development separated by jalan lapangan terbang subang. pink corner paid rm13.07 million or rm70 psf for a 4.28-acre plot while trc land paid rm6.13 million or rm82 psf for a 1.717-acre plot. the parcels were tendered on an as is, where is basis based on agricultural titles, according to a statement by kwasa land. both parcels were sold at 13% and 11% above the reserve price respectively. a total of nine bidders participated in the bids for the parcels that were advertised for sale to bumiputeras only in august 2013.  according to shahril, more small parcels will be made available for tender in the future to allow a broader group of developers to participate in the development.  this story first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly edition, on february 24 - march 2, 2014."}, "302": {"date_posted": "28/2/2014", "title": "#highlight* a challenge for epf to maintain high returns", "article": " the employees provident fund (epf) expects to see at least 10% of its income come from alternative assets, such as real estate and private equity deals, over the next decade to help it continue to deliver good returns on its growing pool of funds, says ceo datuk shahril ridza ridzuan. for this to happen, more money will have to be invested outside the retirement savings managers conventional staple of government bonds and blue chips, and in relatively riskier assets at home and abroad. its global assets doubled in the past three years to reach over rm120 billion or 20.97% of total investment assets as at end-2013. the epf is allowed to invest 23% of its funds outside malaysia and there is a good chance it will hit this ceiling in 2015, if not this year, say experts. without going into the specifics of what the new ceiling for overseas investments should be, shahril, 44, says it will have to gradually go up to give the fund greater flexibility in its investment options.  when emerging markets were being sold down in the second half of 2013, our investments in developed markets worked well for us u2026 gains there helped provided some buffer, he says, explaining how income from the epfs overseas investments is also hedged to protect against currency fluctuations. thats one of the many things we do to give us some level of certainty on the amount of returns we generate. as for the suspicion that the epf supports the local stock market, shahril  who had joined the pension fund in december 2009 as deputy ceo in charge of the investments division before assuming the ceos chair last april  has this to say: there is no particular level that we think the market should be at u2026 for a [large] fund like us, liquidity becomes an issue u2026 managing a rm200 billion fund is very different from managing a rm200 million fund u2026 this is why you will often find that we are a buyer when there are many sellers [in the market] and a seller when there are many buyers.  while it has a long investment horizon, the epf constantly evaluates its portfolio to carry the best holdings because it pays dividends annually from realised income, he explains.  this is why if we think there is not much upside left, we will sometimes accept [lower] offers that we think are a decent price for us to exit at because we cannot get that price in the open market, shahril says when asked about the rationale behind the epfs acceptance of petronas offer for misc bhd that some parties saw as low. shahril: managing a rm200 billion fund is very different from managing a rm200 million fund. this is why the epf is a buyer when there are many sellers and a seller when there are many buyers. he probably would not be surprised to face opposition to the epf putting more money into alternative assets locally and abroad, but prefers to let the results speak for themselves. when the epf flagged the possibility of lower dividends for 2013 due to global volatility, some critics deemed that to be a result of the epf being tapped to support the local equity market as foreigners pulled out from emerging markets, including malaysia.instead, the epf on feb 16 announced another record-high dividend payout  6.35%  which was the highest since the 6.84% announced in 1999. still, after five straight years of dividend growth, even those in favour of the epfs investment diversification wonder if the growth can be sustained as global uncertainties persist. to be sure, with the epfs fund size set to exceed the rm600 billion mark this year, its managers are forced to work harder to deliver at least the targeted minimum annual return of 2% above inflation. total investments had increased from rm341.01 billion as at end-2008 to rm586.66 billion as at end-2013. in line with the growth, to pay 1% dividend to its members, the amount the epf needs has grown by an average 9.12% a year over the past five years from rm3.18 billion in 2008 to rm4.91 billion in 2013. it only needed rm1.68 billion to do the same a decade ago in 2003, when total investments hovered near the rm200 billion mark. higher allocation to equitiesa closer look at the epfs asset allocation over the past five years shows a higher proportion of assets is going into equities while additional investments in fixed income, particularly corporate loans and bonds, has been lower. investments in equities had grown from 25.7% of total investment assets in 2008 to 43% (rm252.14 billion) in 2013, which was up from rm203.9 billion (38.7% of total investments) in 2012 and rm87.9 billion in 2008, data in the epfs annual report shows. by comparison, investments in fixed income (mgs and corporate loans and bonds) had declined to 52.34% in 2013 from 68.25% in 2008, although absolute amounts rose to rm307.1 billion from rm233.4 billion over the period. it should be noted that equities contributed rm19.5 billion or 55.76% to the epfs rm35 billion gross investment income in 2013, up from 34.84% in 2008 when it earned rm6.67 billion. fixed-income investments contributed 39.19% to total investment income last year compared with 61.17% in 2008. the epfs success in equities, which are seen as higher risk assets than quality fixed-income paper, will likely be closely watched.   as it is, the epf, ranked the sixth largest pension fund in asia and the 12th globally by assets under management in 2012 by tower watson, is forced to venture abroad so as to not crowd out other local players and to diversify its portfolio. despite its participation in several high-profile deals  from the u00a38 billion, 15-year battersea power station redevelopment project with s p setia bhd and sime darby bhd to the rm2.28 billion acquisition of rubber research institute land from the government to be turned into the kwasa damansara township  the epf has invested only rm14.4 billion in real estate and other alternative assets so far. thats only 2.45% of its rm586.7 billion total investments as at end-2013 (see tables below).  as for the epfs real estate portfolio in the uk, shahril estimates that its value is likely worth 10% to 15% more today based purely on yield compression because the epf was among the earlier foreign

rm4.46 buy rhb research (dec 26): btoto shares came under some selling pressure, when it cancelled its plans to list its malaysian number forecast operator (nfo) division in singapore.  nonetheless, the stock is still a buy, as its appealing 6.6% to 6.9% annual yield, makes it the most attractive dividend play under our gaming coverage. our discounted cash flow-based fair value, now stands at rm4.46 (from rm5.01), following a revision in our earnings forecasts and weighted average cost of capital assumptions. btoto commands an estimated 41% share of the nfo market, vis-u00e0-vis magnum bhds 35% share. we believe that btotos niche as the only nfo offering lotto games, puts it in a position of strength, compared with other nfos, whose traditional 4d games are facing competition from illegal operators. the companys move to call off its listing, may have been a blessing in disguise, as the proposal would have eventually diluted btotos interest in the nfo, to 28.7% (from 100%), which would then subject btoto to a holding company discount, due to the loss of a directly-owned business. perdana petroleum bhdtarget price: rm2 add cimb research (dec 26): perdana has taken delivery of its 16th vessel, which will be deployed to dayang on a long-term job, wrapping up a year of exceptional turnaround, following several washout years. keep an eye on this company, as it takes on more deliveries in 2014. we continue to value the stock at a 2015 per of 15.8 times, applying a 30% discount to the average per of the oil and gas big caps. the stronger earnings uptick expected in fy14, is the potential re-rating catalyst that supports our add call. we are encouraged that perdanas fleet expansion programme is on track. the operating environment in the marine support space, has been very conducive, with improvement in both charter and utilisation rates. perdana currently fetches a charter rate of around us$2 per horsepower, for a 5,000-horsepower anchor handling

holdings bhdtarget price: rm7.63 neutral midf research (dec 24): mahb exercised its right of first refusal to acquire construction conglomerate gmrs 40% stake in the two companies that operate the istanbul sabiha gokcen (isg) airport, and the hotel, retail outlets and lounge services (lgm). gmr is one of mahbs joint-venture partners. the acquisition will be settled via a total cash consideration of u20ac225 million (equivalent to rm1 billion). the successful deal is expected to lift mahbs stake in isg airport, from 20% to 60%, while the remaining 40% shareholding is still held by limak holdings. the ev/ebitda multiple of the isg and lgm transactions, are calculated at 15 times. based on comparable airports acquisition in europe, in the past eight years, the ev/ebitda multiple was transacted in the range of 9 to 35 times, with an average of 19.6 times.  while isg airport is still loss-making, albeit blessed with good traffic growth factor, we view that the transaction is within the mid-range of the ev/ebitda multiple, and fair in terms of valuation.bimb holdings bhdtarget price: rm4.80 buy maybank ib research (dec 23): we are positive on the price that bimb has paid for the remaining 49% stake in bank islam, which translates into a decent september price-to-book value of 1.8 times, for a bank that offers return on equities of 15% to 16%. the deal is eps accretive, by 10% to 11%. fundamentals remain intact and we project a strong two-year eps cagr of 29%, due in part to earnings accretion from the recent corporate move. with the recent weakness in the share price, we take this opportunity to raise our call to a buy. bimbs net profit is upped 53% to 56% for fy14 and fy15, with expectations that bank islam will account for 88% of group pre-tax profit in fy14. eps accretion is projected to be a lower 10% to 11%, due to the dilutive impact of the rights issue, which contributed to a 40% enlargement in share capital.  overall, we are positive on bimbs prospects. we forecast above-industry financing growth of 16% in fy14 (against the industrys 9% to 10%). ijm corp bhdtarget price: rm6.75 buy maybank ib research (dec 24): ijms 38.4% west coast expressway concession has met all conditions and construction can commence, after the government gave its approval on dec 23, 2013. this is positive for ijm, which is eyeing a significant portion of the works available, potentially boosting its outstanding order book to rm6 billion, from rm2.5 billion. we, however, maintain our earnings forecasts for now, pending the actual award of works. ijm remains as our top buy in construction. ijm has a direct 20% stake in west coast expressway sdn bhd (wcesb). together with its stake in kumpulan europlus, ijm has an effective 38.4% stake in wcesb. our estimate is for the concession to enhance ijms valuations by rm100 million, or 7.8 sen per share, assuming 10% project internal rate of return. ijm hopes to win 70% of the rm5 billion wce work packages, translating into rm3.5 billion. this would significantly boost its outstanding order book, which stood at rm2.5 billion as at end-september 2013, after winning rm538 million, year-to-date. gamuda bhdtarget price: rm5.25 outperform kenanga research (dec 24): just a few days after the deadline for the remaining kesas shareholders acceptance (of which only amcorp properties bhd accepted), gamuda has made fresh offers to the kesas shareholders, that had rejected the earlier offer, namely permodalan nasional bhd (pnb, 20% stake) and perbadanan kemajuan negeri selangor (pkns, 30% stake). gamuda increased the offer price by 12% to rm280 million and rm420 million, for pnb and pkns respectively. gamuda is also increasing amcorps offer value to rm280 million. altogether, gamudas offer price for the 70% stake in kesas, is rm980 million (rm1.4 billion for 100% stake). we are of the view that the 12% increase in the offer price, is still fair, judging from the valuation of normalised per of 12 times (average net profit of rm120 million) against its peer, litrak holdings 17 times. it is also still below our valuation for kesas holdings, at rm1.63 billion. we believe that gamudas strong fundamentals have yet to be fully-priced in its share price.  malaysian resources corp bhdtarget price: rm2.06 buy hlib research (dec 24): mrcb has entered into an agreement with arch angel dmc sdn bhd (aadmc), to acquire a 70% stake in arch angel capital sdn bhd (aac) for rm34 million. the offer price consists of: 1) rm2.5 million for shares in aac from aadmc; 2) rm1.5 million for new shares in aac; and 3) rm30 million for redeemable convertible preference shares in aac. aac has entered into a sale and purchase agreement with putrajaya holdings, for a 1.84-acre freehold parcel, known as plot 2c4, precinct 2, putrajaya. the acquisition has yet to be completed. we understand that the proposed development is for a 13-storey commercial building, with a potential gdv of rm300 million to rm400 million. we are positive on the move to diversify from kl sentral, for development profits. however, the deal will only be meaningful, if the development can be monetised quickly. based on 3qfy13 numbers, mrcb has a cash pile of rm473.8 million, and total debt/sukuk of rm3.4 billion. hence, this acquisition has minimal impact on its balance sheet.datasonic group bhdfair value: rm2.58 buy rhb research (dec 23): datasonics share price went ex on dec 23, 2013, following the completion of its 1-to-5 share split. with that, we foresee improvements in its trading liquidity. we believe fy13 earnings could surpass our rm80.8 million full-year estimate, with dividend surprise, likely on the cards. maintain buy with our fair value increased to rm2.58 (from rm2.36), as we ascribe a higher forecast fy14 target per of 18 times. datasonics daily traded volume averaged at 500,000 shares over the last two months, compared with 200,000, prior to our initiation. the completion of the share split exercise will boost its outstanding share base to 675 million (from 135 million).  this, in our view, could entice participation from retail investors and improve trading liquidity, over the near-to-medium term. we believe that its fy13 earnings, due to be released by mid-february 2014 (at the time of writing), could potentially surpass our full-year estimate of rm80.8 million. we gather that improvements in overall profitability, are likely on higher economies of scale, given that both its mykad and passport contracts have gained further traction in 4q13.tenaga nasional bhdtarget price: rm12.29 add cimb research (dec 23): we have gathered that: 1) future tariff reviews after six months, remain very much the governments prerogative; 2) piped gas prices from petronas could be raised again, assuming there is another round of tariff hike, after six months; and 3) tenagas return on assets (roa) is expected to match its weighted average cost of capital (wacc) by 2017.  the clarification with regards to the tariff hike provides investors with more comfort for tenagas outlook, moving forward. the base tariff hike would improve tenagas roa, to match its wacc by 2017, thus implying that it would drive earnings higher, to a certain extent. although fuel costs remain a concern, we believe that they would not leave tenaga worse off, in the longer run. our target price is unchanged at rm12.29, based on 12.6 times fy15 eps, in line with its historical five-year average per. we maintain our add rating. rerating catalysts include improved earnings for fy14 to fy17, arising from the base tariff hike that is expected to increase tenagas roa. mkh bhdfair value: rm3.05 trading buy kenanga research (dec 26): mkh is a fundamentally strong property developer with a solid 19-year track record of profitability since its listing in 1995.we gather that most of mkhs housing projects are located in kajang and they mainly offer affordable units priced below rm600,000 per unit. this should place mkh in a good position as we believe developers with significant exposure to affordable housing should fare better under the current economic scenario. mkhs fy13 core net profit surged 60% y-o-y to rm123 million. this was mainly due to the strong performance from its property development and construction division in which pbt jumped 69% y-o-y to rm143 million. the plantation divisions core pbt also increased to rm24 million (from last years rm5 million). we have excluded the impact of unrealised forex loss and a gain on asset disposal (rm31 million) in the plantation division. our fair value of rm3.05 is based on a 35% discount to our sop rnav of rm4.69, implying 1.02 times price-to-book value on fy14e book value per share of rm3 or 7.1 times fy14e per.bumi armada bhdtarget price: rm4.43 trading buy alliance research (dec 24): bumi armada has formalised its contract with enquest, to supply the kraken floating production, storage and offloading (fpso) vessel. the contract is worth rm4.6 billion and covers the bareboat charter, as well as the operation and maintenance of the fpso vessel, for a fixed period of eight years, with 17 yearly optional extensions. the contract value is within our estimates.  fy14 is looking to be a good year for bumi armada, with a potential for more news flow on another fpso contract in indonesia. we maintain our trading buy recommendation, given that the long-awaited fpso contracts are finally starting to materialise. there could be some upside from fy16 onwards, from the commencement of operational and maintenance (o&m) works. however, values tend to vary for o&m works, as they depend on the work volume, which may be minimal in the early years of an fpso vessels operations. based on our observation of other fpso contracts, o&m work can sometimes not be profitable. we make no changes to our estimates, at this juncture.tambun indah land bhdfair value: rm2.08 buy rhb research (dec 26): tambun indah has entered into an agreement with gems maju sdn bhd, to construct a campus on an eight-acre site, and thereafter, lease it to the latter for 30 years. while the construction of phase 1, will cost tambun indah rm38 million, gems maju will invest another rm32 million for the campus fittings. phase 1 will have a built-up area of 200,000 sq ft, and according to the management, the rental for the first eight years is fixed at 8% of the construction costs, plus 4% of the land value.  from the ninth year onwards, there will be a step up of 2% annually. this translates into about rm3.5 million per annum, or an attractive 7% yield, based on the net market value of rm35 psf, after a rm5 psf discount for the land. we make no changes to our forecast. we continue to hold our positive view on the penang mainland, as more investments are expected to flow in, in 2014, with tambun indah as the key beneficiary. this story first appeared in the edge weekly

to almost rm200 million. reacting to the announcement, investors pushed perwajas share price up 10.5 sen or 72.4% to close at 25 sen last friday, putting its market capitalisation at rm140 million. kinsteels share price gained five sen or 31.25% to 21 sen, raising its market capitalisation to rm281.7 million.  on wedneday (feb 19), perwaja announed perwaja steel sdn bhd has (pssb) had signed an agreement with tenaga nasional bhd (tnb) to settle all outstanding amounts owing by pssb to tnb in respect of electricity bills for a total sum of rm176.7 million. nevertheless, analysts say investors should not celebrate just yet, as the operating environment remains challenging in the steel industry. furthermore, the groups current financial standing does not look bright and there seems to be an immediate crunch. as at sept 30, 2013, perwajas balance sheet showed it had overdrafts and short-term borrowings of rm1.36 billion as well as other payables of rm693.12 million, which could include amounts owed to petronas and tenaga.  however, inventories and receivables totalled only rm253.99 million (a sharp decline from rm1.1 billion a year ago) and cash and bank balances stood at rm12.22 million, which indicates that it needs fresh working capital to replenish its stock. the groups long-term borrowings stood at rm276.43 million. according to its latest quarterly results ended sept 30, 2013, the groups net loss widened to rm227.13 million from rm38.3 million in the previous year. in the second quarter ended june 30, 2013, net loss stood at rm74.12 million.  the group was affected not only by a drop in sales and lower selling price of steel products but also by the gas supply curtailment for two months by petronas, pending a settlement.  notwithstanding the generally weak environment in the steel industry, executives familiar with perwaja are confident that the group will make the instalment payments after the grace period.   the plant will be restarted soon, giving perwaja enough time during the 18 months to get things running smoothly, says an executive.   perwaja, which is classified under practice note 17 (pn17), is in the process of drawing up a regularisation plan. sources say part of the plan to exit from its pn17 status will require capital injection to strengthen its immediate working capital needs.    as for kinsteel, which holds a 37.3% stake in perwaja, it could see losses narrow should perwajas financial position improve. currently, perwajas profits and losses are consolidated into kinsteels books.   perwaja and kinsteel share the same management team, with tan sri pheng yih huah as managing director and his son, datuk henry pheng chin guan, as ceo.   kinsteel emerged as perwajas controlling shareholder in 2006 when it acquired a 51% stake in the company from the maju group. in 2008, kinsteels shareholding in perwaja was pared down to 37.3% after perwaja sold new shares to list on bursa malaysia.   kinsteel too has not fared too well in recent times. its net loss in the third quarter ended sept 30, 2013, widened to rm111.68 million from rm16.44 million a year ago. like its subsidiary, kinsteel says, it was affected by low selling prices and a drop in production and sales.  kinsteel has been registering losses since its financial year ended dec 31, 2010, and in debt for years. as at sept 30, 2013, the groups total borrowings stood at rm1.93 billion (overdrafts and short-term borrowings at rm1.82 billion and long-term borrowings at rm109.29 million) while cash balances amounted to rm13.33 million.  as global steel prices are expected to remain depressed this year and the local steel industry continues to be mired in the issue of dumping, it could be too early to expect a significant turnaround from

take the shipping giant private at rm5.50 a share last april was fully vindicated after misc announced a huge leap in its fy2013 net profit. the financial results, which were released last thursday, surpassed analyst expectations and prompted a slew of earnings forecast and target price upgrades. a bloomberg poll of at least 13 analysts shows that target prices for the stock now range from rm6.20 to rm8.20. these are far above the rm5.50 that was petronas best offer and prove that the minorities were indeed right in betting that there was more value in misc than what its parent company petronas was willing to offer at the time. over the last year, miscs shares reached a high of rm6.50 and closed at rm6.39 last friday. petronas had painted a bleak picture of the shipping industry back then. it had wanted to take misc private in order to have more flexibility in deciding the companys strategic direction amid the challenging outlook. but miscs latest results are encouraging. net profit for fy2013 surged about 171% to rm2.08 billion, accounting for 117% of consensus forecast, despite a marginal drop in revenue to rm8.97 billion.  while the improvement in profit was largely due to lower impairment losses and a one-time gain on asset disposal, the takeaway for analysts was that miscs shipping losses were narrowing.  the minority shareholders of hong leong capital bhd (hlcap) should also be feeling good about having rejected a takeover offer of rm1.71 a share from business tycoon tan sri quek leng chans hong leong financial group bhd last february.  a year on, hlcap is averaging over rm6 a day on the stock exchange and peaked at rm14 last month. the shares closed at rm10.04 last friday. these two episodes will hopefully empower more minorities to reject privatisation offers that are uncomfortably low.  this story first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly edition, on february 17 - february 23, 2014."}, "307": {"date_posted": "21/2/2014", "title":

various sectors, some of which grow at a slower rate than o&g. o&g companies have a 20% to 30% [annual] earnings growth. to compare their pers with the fbm klcis would not be fair. plantation players, for example, grow at a slower annual pace, she remarks. yvonne tan, eastspring investments bhds chief investment officer of equities, agrees that o&g companies have stronger earnings growth. this, along with strong order books, makes the sector far more attractive than the others, she says. of course, local o&g stocks are trading at a premium compared with their regional peers, but malaysian funds are mandated to invest in local equities only. the limited pool of local o&g stocks has thus created very high demand for them with local funds more than willing to pay a premium for them. in a jan 23 note, hwangdbs vickers research attributes the premium of o&g stocks over others to their growth potential, backed by petronas committed capex for the next few years and the clear earnings visibility of o&g companies that is buttressed by their record-high order books. as at jan 23, petronas had spent only rm76 billion of its rm300 billion budget for o&g jobs until 2015. in 2012, it spent rm45.6 billion, nearly 43% of which was channelled into the upstream sector. contrary to market perception that petronas spending has slowed, we believe the state-owned giant has never been busier, dishing out contracts to the industry. it awarded a slew of mega contracts in 2013, particularly the rm10 billion pan malaysia hook-up and commissioning job and the rm10 billion pan malaysia transport and installation job, says hwangdbs. in the meantime, the upside potential of some o&g counters that have risen substantially has already been priced into them. for example, the shares of umw oil & gas corp bhd (umw-og), which was listed just three months ago, rose 48.6% from the initial public offering price of rm2.80 to close at rm4.16 last thursday.  according to alliance research, umw-og is the only o&g outfit under its coverage with a sell recommendation. it says the stocks valuation is much higher than that of big caps like sapurakencana and bumi armada bhd. furthermore, sapurakencana and bumi armada have better earnings visibility and sizeable order books of rm28 billion and rm10.8 billion respectively, comprising long-term contracts of up to 10 years. on the other hand, umw-og has only secured long-term charters for two of its four drilling rigs and its order book is estimated at rm1.5 billion. sapurakencana continues to be the favourite of analysts. apart from alliances strong buy recommendation, bloomberg shows another 19 with a buy call on the company and average 12-month target price of rm5.38, which implies an upside potential of 20.09%. the stock closed at rm4.48 last thursday. only deleum bhd had a higher implied upside potential  20.47%  among the local o&g stocks. nevertheless, few analysts cover the o&g small cap. eastsprings tan, meanwhile, believes the wide gap between sapurakencanas share price and analysts target price is due to the recent capital outflow from emerging markets, including malaysia. local funds supported the market strongly last month. but support is not as strong this month. local funds have already crowded into o&g stocks and foreigners dont seem ready to invest in the local market at this point, she

the future supply of dry gas for its operations.  in an announcement to bursa malaysia yesterday, perwaja said it had reached an amicable settlement with petronas for a full and final settlement of the amount owed. the company received the executed copy of the settlement agreement from petronas yesterday.  based on the companys results announcement for the third quarter ended september 30, 2013, petronas curtailed the gas supply for two months pending a final settlement of an outstanding liability by pssb. this had affected the operations of the company, leading to a lower production during the quarter. perwaja posted a net loss of rm227 million on revenue of rm236 million for the third quarter, pushing its net loss to rm319.78 million for the first nine months of the 2013 financial year. perwaja said the settlement of the amount with petronas marked an important part of its recovery plan and represented a key element in reviving pssbs operations. in addition, the petronas settlement agreement is part of the groups plan to restructure its financial position and indebtedness under a regularisation plan required by bursa malaysia securities berhad as a pn17 issuer. perwaja had triggered the pn17 status on nov 26 last year as its auditors expressed concern over the groups and its subsidiaries ability to continue as a going concern. there was also a payment

yesterday, the offshore construction and marine service provider said the rise in net profit was due to deferred tax and lower minority interest. the dip in revenue from rm857 million in the previous quarter to rm726.31 million in 4q13 was due to lower contribution from its marine segment, which saw a sharp decline in revenue from rm172.5 million in 4q12 to rm90.3 million in 4q13. for the full year, mhb recorded a net profit of rm236.47 million, a decline of 2.3% from rm242 million in fy12. revenue fell 15.4% to rm2.9 billion from rm3.3 billion in the previous year. the company proposed a final single-tier dividend of five sen per share for fy13 (fy12: 10 sen). on a segmental basis, the offshore business saw a full year profit of rm104.9 million, down 31.7% from rm483.8 million made in the previous year, owing to higher than expected cost to complete ongoing projects. the marine business division generated a full year profit of rm70.4 million, down 12.9% from rm80.8 million in fy12. this is attributed to a lower revenue of rm372 million, against rm483.8 million in fy12. during the year, mhb successfully sailed away/completed six structures for its clients, including the osx-3

rm2.18 from rm1.72. recall that perisai had placed an order with sembcorp marine (smm) to acquire a high-spec jack-up rig (high temperature, high pressure) for us$208 million (rm678 million), to be delivered by july 2014. while perisai is close to securing its first jack-up rig contract, channel checks suggest that the charter rates could be much lower than our original forecast charter rate of us$190,000 per day as the contract may be longer in tenure. we estimate that the rig contract will lift 2014 earnings by rm19 million (assuming a charter rate of us$150,000 per day). on dec 31, 2013, perisai had announced that it had ordered its third jack-up drilling rig from ppl shipyard, singapore for us$211.5 million. perisai will pay a 10% deposit to ppl shipyard in the first quarter (1q) of 2014 and will need to pay another 10% by end-2014 while the remaining 80% will be paid upon delivery. compared with its first two jack-up rigs, perisai is paying an additional us$3.5 million for its third jack-up rig. we understand that jack-up rig builders are well booked for the next two years, so there is a chance for more price hikes as global demand for the asset remains strong. hence, the purchase is timely to leverage on petroliam nasional bhds (petronas) asset localisation policy. we are encouraged by the charter commencement of perisais floating production, storage and offloading (fpso) vessel after a delay since late-july. it marks the companys entry into the fpso segment and its transformation from a bareboat charterer to an operator. early contributions from the vessel will be reflected in its results for the fourth quarter of financial year 2013 ended dec 31 (4qfy13), reducing the earnings vacuum caused by two idle assets, namely its mobile offshore production unit (mopu) and derrick pipelay barge. channel checks suggest that perisai is currently vying for at least two potential contracts for its mopu. we understand that on the domestic front, perisai is tying up with talisman energy inc to charter out its mopu if talisman secures a production sharing contract (psc) in the pm9 oilfield, off peninsular malaysia. industry publication upstream online recently reported that perisai is tying up with petrovietnam drilling to supply its mopu to petronas carigali sdn bhds marginal oilfields in vietnam called ham rong and gau chua-ca cao. while we are hopeful on both prospects, we gather that progress has been slow as the mopu was previously designed for a gas field, hence it is a bit more challenging to charter it out. we do not discount the possibility of an equity fund raising exercise in 2014 given the strength of perisais share price. recall that the company will need to fork out some rm500 million this year to pay for its first jack-up rig, to be delivered towards the end of the second quarter of 2014 (2q14), and an additional rm500 million for its second jack-up rig in 2015. for now, we assume that the company will raise the funds via debt in our earnings forecast. we anticipate weaker sequential earnings in 4qfy13 due to the lack of charter income for its mopu and derrick pipelay barge, although the weakness will be partially offset by maiden contributions from its new fpso vessel (perisai kamelia) and its offshore support vessels. for our earnings forecast for 2014, we are taking a conservative approach with our forecasts and impute merely six months contribution (previously nine months) from its mopu and derrick pipelay barge, leaving some room for upgrades later if it secures a charter before end-2q14. we are also including six months earnings contribution from its jack-up rig (assuming a charter rate of us$150,000 per day). for 2015, we assume full-year earnings contributions from its offshore support vessels, fpso, mopu, derrick pipelay barge and first jack-up rig. we estimate that perisais second jack-up rig could enhance our earnings forecast by rm19 million (assuming a charter rate of us$150,000 per day) if it is able to secure the contract by the end of this year. this will prompt further rerating for the stock in our view. we reiterate our buy recommendation on perisai with a higher target price of rm2.18 as we roll over our valuations to 2015 coupled with an earnings revision. our target price is premised on 14 times 2015f price-earnings ratio and includes the option of securing a second rig contract. we advocate investors to accumulate the shares if it weakens as the current share price has probably factored in the charter of its first jack-up rig. we still believe that there is upside if perisai is able to realise its full earnings potential. an ideal accumulation level will be in the range of rm1.40 to rm1.50.  uob kayhian research, jan 13 this article first appeared in
