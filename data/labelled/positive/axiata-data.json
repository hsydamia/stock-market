construction sectors.  in a report today, cimb research said it believes the market is expecting the ruling coalition  bn  to win with a comfortable majority of parliament seats. bn currently has 133 out of 222 seats in the house of parliament. we view bns widely expected win as neutral to positive for the market. the stock markets performance post the election, will depend on the degree of selling pressure during the campaigning period and the poll results, the report stated. bns ge14 manifesto, which was launched on saturday, resembled an early budget, with pledges for broad voter bases (low-income households, felda settlers, females, the elderly and farmers). the key promises included a top-up on 1malaysia people's aid (br1m) payments, raising the minimum wage to rm1,500 within five years, potential revisions in personal and corporate income taxes, expansion of affordable housing aid, special incentives and funds for felda settlers, and subsidised public transport passes, broadband and other consumer goods/services. the br1m will be introduced for the households income of rm4000 to rm5000, which will receive a total of rm700 in two payments in june and august, while double br1m handouts will be due in june and august for households earning below rm4000 per month and individuals earning below rm2000 per month. the statement said the additional br1m payments amount to at least rm3.71 billion or 0.25% of gross domestic product (gdp) in 2018, which comes on top of the prior weeks civil servant pay hikes of rm1.46 billion, effective july 1 this year. new spending commitments imply that the budget deficit is unlikely to improve significantly from the target 2.8% of gdp, despite windfalls from higher oil prices and gdp growth. the election committees (ec) will hold a special meeting to decide on, as well as announce the nomination and polling dates. during ge13, the ec held its special meeting a week after the dissolution of the parliament. the

can only continue if the technical resistance level at 1,850 points can be broken. momentum indicators are mixed. the relative strength index and oscillator indicators have climbed above their

expectations of rm90 billion in infrastructure bond and sukuk issuances. as for loan growth in 2018, cimb is looking at a higher range of 4% to 5% for the banking sector as a whole compared with 2017. annualised loan growth for the banking sector came in at 3.3% for the first 11 months of 2017. we will only reveal cimbs targets for loan growth at the end of february when we announce our results. but our house view for the industry is around 4% to 5%. given the size of [the cimb] group in malaysia, we would not be too far off from the industry target, said tengku zafrul. he answered in the affirmative when asked if the robust gross domestic product (gdp) growth in 2017, which averaged at 5.9% for the first three quarters, would translate into better loan growth in 2018. gdp growth last year was above expectations which is positive, and we believe this will translate into stronger loan growth for 2018 compared with 2017. last years loan growth was low due to corporates but this year we foresee that loan growth from corporates would be stronger, he said. most economists are expecting a hike in the overnight policy rate (opr) by 25 basis points in 2018, which would make loans more expensive. however, cimb head of treasury, markets and wholesale banking chu kok wei opined that a rate hike would not have a major impact on loan growth for banks. we dont expect the pricing of loans due to opr [hike] to have a big impact on loan growth. it boils down to the fundamental strength of the economy, like last year [when] gdp growth came in better than expected. also the [general] election has to happen this year so that the overhang issue would be over, hence we do see an upside in corporate investment activities which hopefully translates into fundraising from both loans and also capital markets, he said. tengku zafrul noted that cimb was the best-performing banking stock in 2017, and the second best-performing stock on the fbm klci, yielding total shareholders a return of 51.2%. thanks to the excellent execution of our target 2018 (t18) strategy, the group recalibrated quickly and is now on a sustainable growth path, underpinned by our emphasis on the 5cs which are

homegrown social marketing platform and e-wallet, bringing a new way to save on shopping and help sellers get more shoppers to boost their brands and sales, a source tells the edge. it is learnt that puc will introduce the unconventional services to the market in phases next year. all details and the targeted timeline for each phase will be revealed at the mid-december launch. another source highlights that e-wallet is a lucrative area of growth in the modern economy and, hence, pucs scheme will promote customer-to-customer (c2c) payments to shoppers. moving forward, puc may even promote more financial services to shoppers. it will enable c2c payments based on convenience-centric lifestyle activities such as seamless dining bill-splitting, he says. puc is also exploring services that will bridge the gap between shoppers and convenient financial services. however, all these are subject to obtaining the necessary licences from the authorities. puc, formerly known as puc founder (msc) bhd, is an ace market-listed information technology solutions provider that is also involved in renewable energy, media and advertising as well as e-payment processing services. to recap, in early september, puc obtained conditional approval as an e-money issuer from bank negara malaysia. the group also has two subsidiaries with moneylending licences. in a filing with bursa malaysia on sept 7, puc announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, epp solution sdn bhd, had been given approval to issue e-money within a year. epp solution  also a registered business with bank negara for merchant acquiring services  will be joining a list of at least 25 non-bank entities that have been given approval to issue e-money via their mobile apps. other players include aeon credit service (m) bhd, alipay malaysia sdn bhd, axiata digital ecode sdn bhd, managepay services sdn bhd, paypal pte ltd, touch n go sdn bhd and xox com sdn bhd. five banks, namely ambank (m) bhd, bank of china (m) bhd, cimb bank bhd, malayan banking bhd and rhb bank bhd, have also received the green light from the central bank to become e-money issuers. for perspective, there are two types of e-money schemes  the small scheme and the large scheme  which are determined by the purse size and the outstanding e-money liabilities. puc said in the sept 7 announcement that it has obtained approval from bank negara to issue e-money under the large scheme, which refers to a maximum purse limit of rm1,500. in comparison, the small scheme only allows a maximum purse limit of rm200. it is worth noting that puc recently embarked on a few exclusive collaborations with some start-ups, paving the way for the company to build its e-wallet business. last month, puc announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, founder qube sdn bhd (fq), has signed a memorandum of understanding with hong kong-based advwhere ltd for a collaboration, where fq will be appointed with the exclusive right to sell cloudbreakr digital advertisement placement solutions across malaysia, indonesia and singapore. puc is also teaming up with point-of-sale services provider bersian technology (m) sdn bhd to implement a cross-marketing collaboration. in june, puc signed an exclusive partnership agreement with laputa ventures sdn bhd to use the latters advertising platform, dubbed moola, to offer on-vehicle advertising.  variation to utilisation of proceeds while puc has obtained approval as an e-money issuer and identified its partners, it needs the funds to launch the service. it has said rm36.45 million had been allocated for the rolling out of the e-money scheme. interestingly, the money will be coming from the rm42.65 million raised from a rights issue of irredeemable convertible unsecured loan stocks (iculs) in february last year. puc is in the process of obtaining clearance from the relevant regulators to vary the utilisation of the proceeds. puc has submitted its request to securities commission malaysia. barring any unforeseen circumstances, the company should be able to call an extraordinary general meeting as early as december to get shareholders approval, says a source familiar with the company. to recap, the edge in april reported that puc had net cash of rm43.3 million, rm42.65 million of which it cannot use for any purpose other than to expand its renewable energy business. in october 2015, puc proposed the issuance of iculs with warrants to raise up to rm83.9 million, but only managed to get rm42.65 million to fund its solar expansion programme. in february last year, jack cheong chia chieh, the chief of puc, died of a sudden illness at the age of 44. market observers have pointed out that his brother and successor, cheong chia chou, who was appointed the new managing director last december, is not keen on the renewable energy business that was started by the late chia chieh. instead, he is more interested in developing the companys it business. under the feed-in-tariff programme, puc currently operates a 1mw capacity solar photovoltaic power plant in sungai petani, kedah. the output will be supplied to tenaga nasional bhd at a fixed rate. to date, however, puc has yet to be awarded any new project despite efforts to apply for quota with the sustainable energy development authority of malaysia and energy commission. year to date, shares of puc have risen 223%. the stock closed at 21 sen last thursday, giving the company a market capitalisation of rm284 million.

"}, "31": {"date_posted": "10/4/2017", "title": "lead story: some indicators looking up, but this has given false hope in the past", "article": "  as the curtain falls on the first quarter (1q2017), it is clear that the local stock market is having a party. the benchmark fbm klci is up 5.99%, its fastest quarterly expansion since 2013 and its best start to a year since 2007. the return of foreign investors, who were net sellers over the past two years due to a weakened ringgit, is one of the factors that is fuelling the rally. year to date till march 24, foreign investors have poured a net rm1.378 billion into local stocks, according to data tracked by midf research. the past two years had seen a net outflow of rm19.5 billion in 2015 and rm3 billion last year. however, the fbm klci is still lagging behind other emerging markets, slightly underperforming the msci developed markets index, which rose 6.21% in 1q2017. in comparison, the msci emerging markets index has expanded twice as fast at 12.43% over the same period. this lag is consistent with the trend over the past 12 months, says alliancedbs research head of research bernard ching. while improving fundamentals and sustained bullish sentiment will keep the malaysian market buoyant in the near term, he says the upside to fundamental valuations has narrowed, though not yet stretched. asset prices are likely to overshoot fundamental values in a liquidity driven rally, ching says. as such, investors should look for profit-taking opportunities as and when they arise. the emerging question is whether the strong first quarter is signalling a strong year ahead for the fbm klci. it began the past two years in green, albeit more moderate, territory but finished in the red, down 3% last year and falling 3.9% in 2015. thus far, bursa malaysia has closed three consecutive years in retreat, although it is still, according to bloomberg, technically, the worlds longest bull market at eight years and counting since the last correction over 20% in 2008. some indicators, such as the ringgit, are looking up, but have proved to be false hope before. the ringgit has regained some lost ground against the greenback over the past three months, up 1.35% to 4.4255 as at march 31. however, it is still down 12% over the past year compared with 3.8905 on april 1 last year. in us dollar terms, the fbm klci has gained 8.1% ytd, outperforming some regional peers such as the jakarta composite index (+6.8%) and the nikkei (+4.8%), though lagging behind the straits times index (+14.2%) and the hang seng index (+10.2%). banks and government-linked companies have driven the fbm klcis rise this quarter, making up 7 of the top 10 gainers among its 30 constituents. corporate announcements and news flow are a significant sentiment driver this quarter. a notable example is sime darby bhds 14.57% rise up to march 31 as excitement builds over its much-anticipated demerger plan that will see the plantation and property units separately listed on bursa. the demerger plan was announced in february, six months after tan sri abdul wahid omar took the helm at permodalan nasional bhd, the bumiputera equity firm that controls the majority of sime darby shares. with a reputation in corporate malaysia as a mr fixit, wahids mandate is to improve the corporate performance of pnbs stable of companies. when he took over, the cumulative performance of pnb companies underperformed the fbm klci. the impact on investor sentiment was almost immediate  the collective showing of pnb companies overtook the benchmark in october and has outperformed the fbm klci year to date. elsewhere across the market this quarter, the shift in sentiment and investing appetite is also clearly visible as investors opt for commodity and cyclical stocks over more defensive counters. while the inflection point came around october last year, the shift has been more pronounced so far this year. ytd, commodity counters are collectively up 10.5% while cyclicals are up 10.8%. in comparison, defensive counters are up by a total of 1.7%. among the commodity counters that have done well are press metal bhd which chalked up a ytd return of 66.1%, felda global ventures holdings bhd (34.2%) and batu kawan bhd (23.1%). the outperformers among the cyclicals were airasia bhd (62.6%), ekovest bhd (48.1%) and malaysia building society bhd (44.4%). the defensive stocks that outperformed included my e.g. services bhd (25.2%), time dotcom bhd (11.9%) and axiata bhd (9.1%). ching of alliancedbs research expects this trend to continue as cyclical stocks tend to outperform defensive stocks in a liquidity-driven rally. earnings prospects for malaysian equities have improved after the earnings downgrade cycle ended in 3q2016. with a nascent earnings recovery and more stable commodity prices, cyclical stocks will outperform defensive stocks in 2017, ching says. outside of the 30 top stocks making up the benchmark index, small and mid-cap companies are also taking off and outperformed the fbm klci. the fbm70 index has risen 12% since the year began, while the fbm small cap index grew 15.5%. much of the bullishness has been seen in the technology counters, which is the best performing sector ytd with a 38.2% gain. construction and property counters are also rallying by just over 15% each. driving the tech sectors rally is excitement over apple incs upcoming iphone 8, with most expecting strong sales. players within the apple supply chain such as globetronics technology bhd and inari amertron bhd were among the first counters to surge. while ching sees further upside for tech stocks, he says valuations are now quite fair after the ytd run-up and thinks a rerating will only happen once the iphone 8 begins selling around the third quarter of the year. meanwhile, the property rally is driven by investors seeing the sector as a good proxy to the larger market, says kenanga research head of equity research sarah lim. however, the rally is detached from physical market fundamentals and is more driven by news flow. lim believes valuations have bottomed out and developers are unlikely to see substantial earnings misses this year. more likely, we will see most developers on target or slightly beating estimates for the full year in terms of sales. notably, the oil and gas sector rose 8.2% this quarter as global brent crude oil prices remained steady around us$55 per barrel for most of the quarter, thanks to the six-month, organization of petroleum exporting countries-led output cut which began in january. however, the outlook for oil and gas stocks remains uncertain, says ching, and will largely depend on company-specific news flow and further movement in oil prices. while kitchen sinking and impairment charges are largely done, earnings recovery is still at a nascent stage and uneven, given the low utilisation rate (for vessel owners) and slow order book replenishment (for fabricators), says ching. as at march 30, brent crude was trading at us$52.96 a barrel, down 7.8% from its ytd high of us$57.10 on jan 6.

axiata group bhds 19.8%-owned associate, has agreed to merge with vodafone india to create the largest mobile player in india. according to bloomberg, the merged entity is worth about us$23.2 billion (rm102.54 billion), based on the combined enterprise value of us$12.4 billion for vodafone india and us$10.8 billion for idea cellular. this merger is only expected to be completed in 2018. we estimate that axiatas stake in idea cellular is likely to be diluted from 19.8% to less than 10% post-completion of the merger. given the dilution in shareholding, we think axiata might consider selling its stake since it will not be able to equity-account idea cellulars earnings in the future. however, we think this could take some time to materialise as it does not appear that either vodafone india or aditya birla group is interested in buying out axiatas stake. assuming that the stake sale takes place at the current market valuation of rm4.4 billion (or 49 sen per share), this could help reduce axiatas gearing from 2.1 times to 1.6 times in terms of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. axiatas share price has been buoyed recently by several positive news flows including: i) potential stake sale in singapores m1 ltd; ii) potential stake sale in idea cellular; and iii) potential merger with telekom malaysia bhd. having said that,

offer a glimmer of hope", "article": "  a steady rise in the cost of living, a weak ringgit and a gloomy economic outlook have forced malaysians to cut back on their spending and keep their money for a rainy day. however, the latest corporate reporting season has offered some hope of better days ahead. still, dont pop the champagne corks yet. last week, 808 companies listed on bursa malaysia released their financial results for the quarters ended november or december 2016. (bursa has 927 companies in total. the remaining 119 have different fiscal year-ends.) according to data compiled by the edge, 440 companies reported better year-on-year financial performance for 4q2016 while 368 reported the converse. of the 440 that performed better, 273 posted higher profits, 101 returned to the black while 66, though they still lost money, narrowed their losses. as for those that fared worse than a year ago, 209 reported lower profits, 91 slipped into the red while 68 saw wider losses. so, of the 808 companies, 583 are profitable while 225 are loss-making. overall, the situation is positive  unless, of course, the remaining 119 companies (13% of public limited companies) post poor 4q results later this month. this is consistent with aggregate headline corporate earnings (including extraordinary items), which grew 7% year on year to rm20.5 billion in 4q (see charts). note that these figures are based on only those companies that have reported their 4q results. when the figures of the remaining 119 are included, total corporate earnings are likely to be higher than rm20.5 billion. it is also worth noting that total corporate earnings contracted for four consecutive quarters  from 3q2015 to 2q2016  before growing in 3q and 4q last year. excluding those that have not reported their 4q results, sectors that pulled up corporate earnings are banking, conglomerate and hospitality. malayan banking bhd, the countrys largest lender, saw its net profit jump 43% to rm2.36 billion in 4q, buoyed by an improvement in revenue from a pick-up in loans as well as a robust fee income and underscored by disciplined cost management that resulted in a smaller rise in overhead expenses. hong leong bank bhds net profit rose as well, by 60% to rm549.94 million due to higher net income, lower operating expenses and lower charge on allowance for impairment losses on loans, advances and financing (see have banks traded ahead of fundamentals? on page 10). conglomerate sime darby bhds net profit more than doubled to rm644 million, driven by its plantation division, which benefited from an increase in crude palm oil prices and higher fresh fruit bunch production. in the hospitality sector, genting malaysia bhd saw a fourfold increase in net profit to rm1.69 billion while genting bhds net profit surged 237% to rm1.14 billion. note that there is double counting here as genting controls genting malaysia, whose earnings were boosted by a rm1.27 billion gain from the sale of its 16.8% stake in genting hong kong ltd to golden hope ltd. as for the oil and gas sector, downstream players benefited from recovering crude oil prices while upstream players that provide support services registered larger impairment losses. the sectors that dragged down corporate earnings were healthcare and telecommunications.  best performers oil and gas downstream thanks to higher oil prices, downstream players, such as petrol retailer petronas dagangan bhd (petdag), shell refining co federation of malaya bhd, petron malaysia refining & marketing bhd and gas malaysia bhd, saw their combined earnings almost triple to rm633.5 million in 4q, up from rm215.1 million a year ago. dated brent has recovered gradually, rising to an average of us$54 per barrel at end-2016 from as low as us$31 per barrel at the start of the year. petdags net profit soared 183% to rm261.49 million  mainly due to improved margins from petrol  in line with the upward trend in means of platts singapore prices in the second half of last year. shell posted a 115% rise in net profit to rm207.8 million, attributed to the gradual recovery in the prices of crude oil and other products. petron, meanwhile, recorded a near sevenfold increase in net profit to rm112.62 million on growing sales volume and higher margins. gas malaysia, which distributes natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas to residences and industries, saw its net profit multiply five times to rm51.86 million on higher volume of gas sold, toll fees and assets contributed by customers.  plantations after being overlooked in the past couple of years, plantation players seem to be gaining momentum as commodity prices stage a comeback. genting plantations bhd, th plantations bhd, boustead plantations bhd, tsh resources bhd and hap seng consolidated bhd all ended 2016 on a high note. kuala lumpur kepong bhd and ioi corp bhd may have weighed the sectors earnings down but this was due to a high base effect and the foreign exchange factor. klks net profit more than halved to rm360.68 million from a year ago when a one-off gain of rm485.7 million from the disposal of plantation land was booked. excluding this, the groups pre-tax profit should be 11% higher. iois net profit fell 98% to rm15.6 million due to a forex translation loss of rm330 million on its foreign currency-denominated borrowings. other than the two, most of the plantation players posted better earnings except tdm bhd, which suffered a loss of rm21.6 million due to bigger losses at its indonesian operation, mainly from the impairment of assets.  consumer finance the jump in the earnings of consumer finance companies may not seem as significant as that of traditional banking groups but malaysia building society bhd, aeon credit service m bhd and rce capital bhd have been quietly making profits by giving out loans. mbsb, aeon credit and rce capital saw their financial performance improve by rm61.45 million, rm13.69 million and rm8.77 million respectively in 4q2016. financial service provider mbsb returned to the black with a quarterly net profit of rm45.64 million versus a net loss of rm15.81 million a year earlier on higher islamic financing income and lower bad loan allowance.  worst performers  telecommunications telecoms players reported a mixed bag of 4q report cards. the financial results of axiata group bhd, telekom malaysia bhd (tm) and digi.com bhd were weaker while those of time dotcom bhd and maxis bhd were stronger. however, the overall corporate earnings of the sector were severely hit by axiata, which reported a net loss of rm309.5 million in 4q2016 versus a net profit of rm467.24 million the year before due to a significant increase in forex loss, a lower contribution from 20%-owned idea cellular ltd in india and the weaker performance of celcom. similarly, tm saw its net profit fall nearly 20% to rm154.3 million, also primarily due to forex losses from group borrowings, arising from the ringgits depreciation against the us dollar. digis net profit dropped 2% to rm374.63 million in 4q2016 as revenue also fell on lower prepaid income and the group registering higher taxes. the poorer performance of these companies raises the question of whether they can still pay out decent dividends to shareholders.  healthcare and pharmaceuticals most healthcare and pharmaceutical companies ended the year on a low note, save for kpj healthcare bhd and ysp southeast asia holdings bhd. pharmaniaga bhd, apex healthcare bhd and ccm duopharma biotech bhd saw their earnings shrink by rm16.9 million, rm7 million and rm5.4 million respectively. but the bombshell came from ihh healthcare bhd, which slipped into the red with a net loss of rm42.5 million compared with a net profit of rm415.8 million in the previous year. the hospital operator made an exchange loss of rm244.59 million in 4q2016 against an exchange gain of rm121.27 million the year before. besides, it recognised higher doubtful debt expenses of rm49 million in 4q2016 compared with rm9.9 million the year before.  oil and gas services although global oil prices are headed higher, upstream players such as bumi armada bhd, umw oil & gas corp bhd (umwog), th heavy engineering bhd, malaysia marine and heavy engineering holdings bhd, alam maritim resources bhd and petra energy bhd have yet to shine. a whopping impairment charge of rm1.15 billion resulted in bumi armadas net loss widening to rm1.29 billion. umwog saw its net loss double to rm918.4 million, due mainly to an additional asset impairment loss of rm780.2 million. it has not gone unnoticed that these companies took advantage of the present environment and conducted kitchen sinking in 4q. theoretically, if oil prices continue to recover gradually, more jobs should come in and these o&g service providers should come out of the woods.  worst may be over if the latest numbers are any indication, overall corporate earnings showed signs of improvement in 4q2016, suggesting that the worst may be over and things should get better in 1q this year. after all, crude oil prices are holding up well and commodity prices are recovering steadily. according to areca capital sdn bhd ceo danny wong teck meng, three years ago, the downward trend in corporate earnings was caused by higher costs and a shrinking top line, which squeezed margins. but today, corporate earnings are recovering in tandem with oil prices. im optimistic about the outlook for corporate earnings because the cost structure has become leaner. so, margins will improve even if revenue remains stagnant. there is also the low base effect, he tells the edge. but he warns, it was bad in the past three years. we were in a bearish and cautious mood, so the turnaround in mood may not be felt immediately. wong also points out how more americans appear to be accepting president donald trumps policies as he seems to be able to get things done. assuming he (trump) really manages to fulfil some of his pledges, such as the us$1 trillion worth of infrastructure, it bodes well for global growth. in short, if he manages to drive the american economy, there should also be an improvement in consumer spending and confidence as well as overall corporate earnings. hong leong investment bank bhd dealer representative frank lin concurs. in the last few months, the important stock indices, especially the dow jones, have been hitting new highs and american investors seem to have taken a liking to their president. despite its debt problems, europe is very stable while china is recovering, he tells the edge. lin believes that there is light at the end of the tunnel for corporate earnings and that the stock market is reacting to it at the moment. construction will continue to do well while plantations will pick up because of higher commodity prices. the consumer sector should perform fairly well too. as stock markets gain momentum, given time, real estate prices usually follow suit, which in turn will see new excitement in property counters, he says. however, he warns that once the global economy picks up, central bankers, especially the us federal reserve, may tighten their monetary policies by raising interest rates. in fact, the fed is expected to raise rates as early as this month. the [current] depressed interest rate is actually helping the economy a lot. this will be one of the major concerns now as the stock market usually reacts negatively to rate hikes. a head of research, who declined to be named, is, however, not too optimistic about earnings growth. we think there is still more downside risk for

price of rm5: idea cellular (20% owned by axiata group bhd) and vodafone group have confirmed merger discussions in india. discussions are at a preliminary stage and subject to a number of approvals (like the telecommunication regulator, the competition commission of india) but ideas stock price is up more than 40% from jan 18 this year  effectively pricing in a reasonable portion of the estimated merger gains, in our view. while the gains for idea quantify to limited upside for axiata arising from its diversified portfolio (about 25% gain in ideas share price mathematically quantifies to about 2% upside for axiatas share price), we believe a potential merger would be directionally positive with increased expectations of axiata benefiting from consolidation in other markets. industry restructuring or rationalisation is one of the key objectives for axiata and opportunities exist in malaysia and indonesia, in our view. axiatas strategy is to also drive return on invested capital (roic) improvement through potential portfolio optimisation, which we believe could drive a rerating. our current rating is neutral. idea has further revealed that merger discussions are at a preliminary stage and the fundamental premise of the discussion is equal rights between the aditya birla group and vodafone in the combined entity. for equal rights, it may be necessary for the aditya birla group to infuse funds into idea. benchmarking to major in-market mobile-mobile mergers that have taken place in europe over recent years, we estimate a potential vodafone-idea merger could result in annual run rate savings of 82 billion rupees (rm5.4 billion) comprising 52 billion rupees in operating expenditure (opex) and 31 billion rupees in capital expenditure (capex), leading to net present value of synergies of 600 billion rupees or about us$9 billion (rm39.87 billion). targeted synergies in intramarket consolidations in europe have been 8% to 10% of combined opex and 18% to 20% of combined capex. merger integration costs have often eliminated around 20% to 30% of these targeted savings, whereas in some cases operators have also guided to hope for revenue synergies. we note the expected true realisable synergies from a vodafone-idea merger would be far more substantial than the benchmark drive figure suggests as the merger would drive stronger network cost savings as spectrum ownership in india currently is much scarcer than across other global telecommunication markets. industry restructuring or rationalisation is one of the key objectives for axiata. in our view, opportunities exist in malaysia and indonesia. consolidation in malaysia could ease intense market competition and capex requirements. our discussions with indonesian telecommunication companies (telcos) indicate a general acknowledgement of the need for a healthier industry structure through consolidation. with relatively limited spectrum allocation, visibility on spectrum retention could be a key factor in driving industry consolidation in indonesia. due to wireless data and network cost economics, axiatas roic has declined to below the weighted average cost of capital. as part of its strategy, axiata could now assess portfolio optimisation to reduce exposure where roic has been lagging and improvement is more challenging. axiata plans on increasing capital allocation to operating companies with higher roic potential. our analysis suggests that global emerging market telcos trade reflexively to roics. the roic improvement through portfolio potential could drive a rerating of axiatas share price, in our view.  jp morgan, jan 31"}, "52": {"date_posted": "6/2/2017", "title": "klci expected to move higher, aim to cross 1,700 level", "article": " kuala lumpur (feb 6): the fbm

the intense competition in india will continue. axiata group bhd currently owns a 19.79% stake in idea cellular ltd, the third-largest telecommunications (telco) player in india (17% market share). in 2010, axiata made an rm1 billion impairment loss in respect of its investment in idea, mainly due to the discrepancy between the carrying value and market value of idea as a result of intense price competition in indias telco market. however, ideas profitability recovered strongly from financial year ending dec 31, 2012 (fy12) onwards as the market expanded exponentially. for financial year 2017s forecast (fy17f), however, idea is expected to post a sharp decline in earnings. 2016 was a landmark year for the indian telco sector due to the entry of a greenfield player, reliance jio infocomm ltd, which introduced fierce price competition into the market by offering free voice calls and low-cost data. note that the market has traditionally been voice-driven. going forward, we expect margins to remain under pressure as the decline in voice revenue (free voice products have been offered) is not sufficiently compensated by growth in data revenue (due to low mobile data tariffs). operators are likely to face immense pressure to retain customers by offering freebies and rebates. in november 2016, vodafone recognised a u20ac5 billion (rm23.8 billion) write-down for its indian subsidiary, the second-largest telco player in the country (19% market share). we believe there is a possibility that axiata may have to further impair its investment value in idea in the near term. based on our estimate, the book value of axiatas investment in idea is 146 rupees (rm9.40) times the number of shares held (rm6.7 billion) as at dec 31, 2016 while ideas market price is only 69 rupees (times the number of shares held: rm3.2 billion). nevertheless, we think any potential impairment may not be sizeable as axiata has taken rm1 billion write-down in the past when the share price was hovering around the prevailing level. since our upgrade to trading buy, the share price has risen by about 10%. as we foresee earnings risk in the near term on the back of potential write-down on idea, we now downgrade the stock to neutral. in addition, we are also concerned with axiatas ability to collect the rm375.5 million from telia norway, posting risk of provisioning in the future.

relative strength index and moving average convergence divergence indicators also show the trend is turning bullish. furthermore, the fbm klci is now trading above the top band of the bollinger bands indicator. however, the momentum is weak as trading volume in the past few weeks has been low. with only three weeks left to trading, we expect the market to climb higher for window dressing. the support that we have seen in the past few weeks and the breakout of the resistance last week indicate that there has been some accumulation. the plantation, oil and gas, banking and telecommunications

ltd (aberdeen asia) sees earnings per share (eps) growth for malaysian public-listed companies to come in between 5% and 10% in 2017, driven by oil prices, domestic consumption, and the growth of the global economy. david smith, who is head of corporate governance at aberdeen asia, said the eps growth of malaysian corporates is expected to be higher than the forecast 4% to 5% of gross domestic product growth for malaysia in 2017. whats positive for us on malaysian equities is that domestic consumption has stayed resilient despite the goods and services tax [implemented in 2015]. we think malaysia is somewhat attractive within this region, [but it comes down to] stock selection. we have to find companies that are going to be leveraging off domestic consumption and demand, he said at a news conference in conjunction with aberdeens augmented reality presentation yesterday. aberdeen asia-pacific head of multi-asset solutions irene goh said that at present, malaysia and other asian equity markets are not seeing a multiple expansion in indices due to uncertainties such as the pressure on currencies and capital flight from emerging markets. hopefully when we get to 2017, there will be more clarity on trade policies, and [if] donald trump the pragmatist and businessman shows up in the white house rather than donald trump the populist, maybe we can get tailwinds that are supportive of better market performance for equities in the region, she said. as for the outlook for fixed income investment in malaysia, aberdeen islamic asset management investment manager mohammad hasif said that bonds with longer terms, or at the long end of the curve, are attractive. at aberdeen, we have been fundamentally positive on malaysia for some time, so we took opportunities in the longer end of the malaysian bond space, basically 20- to 30-year malaysian government securities, as we think that part looks attractive, even on a forward-looking basis. the longer end of the malaysian government bond space has generally been well supported by the employees provident fund, insurance companies and pension funds, so we think that part of the bond curve is well anchored, he said. mohammad hasif said another theme adopted by aberdeen is to move into us dollar malaysian bonds. us dollar malaysian issuances such as petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) issuances and axiata group bhds [us dollar bonds] which have [been] sold off and had been expensive previously, have now started to look quite cheap. so what we have done is switching from some of our expensive bonds such as [south] korean us dollar bonds to some of the malaysian bonds which have started to look cheap after the sell-off. for us dollar credits, we look at it more on a spread basis as opposed to an outright yield. we are fundamentally positive on these companies. petronas, for example, despite the [low] oil prices, has had a very disciplined management of its finances, and has a very pragmatic management of its capex (capital expenditure) programmes. so with that, and a cheap valuation, it was a very easy decision for us to make, he said. total assets under management for aberdeen asia

southeast asia certainly is not an easy terrain for e-commerce. in fact, this year two large e-commerce platforms closed shop in the region, including in malaysia. in february, japanese e-commerce giant rakuten announced that it would close its platforms in malaysia, singapore and indonesia after several years in business. the catcha groups ensogo announced in march that it was shutting down its flash deals and marketplace business units in the region, including in malaysia, singapore, thailand and indonesia. daily deal websites such as groupon have also been struggling in malaysia and the region. for now, malaysias business-to-consumer (b2c) e-commerce space is dominated by three market leaders  lelong.my, lazada malaysia and 11street malaysia. lelong.my is a homegrown platform and one of the early movers in malaysias e-commerce scene. lazada was founded by german internet company rocket internet and has a presence all over southeast asia. chinas alibaba group recently invested us$1 billion in a controlling stake in lazada, ostensibly to get in on the asean e-commerce growth story. 11street malaysia is a joint venture between telecommunications firm celcom axiata bhd and south koreas sk planet co ltd, which operates 11street in its home country. competition in the e-commerce space has intensified, given the seemingly borderless nature of internet commerce. apart from fighting each other and the smaller e-retailers, the big three are in a race of sorts with foreign internet retail giants that malaysians have access to, including ebay, amazon, taobao and other popular retailers outside the country. according to euromonitor, third-party merchants accounted for a third of internet retail sales in 2015, followed by amazon with about 14%, though the latter has seen a 2% decline in its share of retail sales value from 2012, as consumers bought from other websites. apart from internet-based companies, several local companies are jumping on the e-commerce bandwagon. hong leong groups gemfive b2c platform opened last may and apparel manufacturer padini holdings bhd recently announced plans for an e-retail site for its own products. then there are satellite pay-tv provider astro malaysia holdings bhd, which started go shop in january last year, and media company media prima bhds e-commerce platform cj wow shop. both are joint ventures with south korean partners, with the media companies hoping to leverage their existing platforms to push sales. all these different platforms are heating up the competition in the e-commerce landscape on multiple fronts. they are competing for buyers and they are competing for sellers. e-commerce is like that. you need to grab both sides for it to work, says an executive with a local e-commerce platform. in a bid to court consumers, internet retail platforms have been furiously dishing out price subsidies  often in the form of promo codes, first-time buyer discounts and special flash sales. this means customer acquisition costs are not cheap because you are effectively subsidising customer purchases with your discounts, but that is the way the game goes when you come into the market, says the executive. platforms  particularly lazada and 11street  have in the last year significantly ramped up their product offerings almost tenfold to over six million stock keeping units (skus) each. compare this with early 2015, when only lelong.my had more than one million skus, says clsa in a report on e-commerce. this ramp-up in skus could drive accelerated growth in b2c online sales in malaysia by 20% in 2016, from 15% a year ago, clsa says. overall, clsa is also forecasting that online sales will slowly take a larger share of total sales in malaysia, from 2.5% in 2015 to 4.1% in 2020. lazada malaysia has been working with established brands to bring traditionally offline retailers aboard its platform. it has partnered big brands and renowned retailers  including levis, loru00e9al, samsung and nestlu00e9  in a bid to increase its range of products. for example, lazada just launched its brands for all campaign that features over 1,000 brands and 55,000 international and local merchants. for lazada, a b2c platform, this could be a win-win. brands are realising the importance of having an online presence as this equates to a bigger reach and an increase in the number of consumers, says lazada malaysia ceo hans-peter ressel. a dbs report on e-commerce in asia concluded that offline retailers in countries like malaysia, indonesia and thailand are not facing as big a threat from online players as china and singapore, where retailers are already losing market share. but this is not to be taken for granted. in fact, there is much potential for traditionally offline retailers to use online as another channel to grow sales. dbs warns that department stores and other retailers with relatively lower sales psf are likely to have their business models disrupted in the near future. retail segments that could see some tough competition from pure e-commerce operators include handbag and luggage, cosmetics, home appliances and food products. retailers selling lifestyle and luxury products, meanwhile, may be more resilient as competition from online merchants is much less aggressive in these areas, says dbs in its report. according to ressel, lazada is increasingly focusing on consumers living outside the klang valley and kuala lumpur, areas where people may find it hard to access quality branded products. weve found that 81% of our shoppers reside outside kuala lumpur and they often have limited access to quality branded products and shopping malls. this has presented a key opportunity for us to cater for various markets in the country and expand our product offerings. consumers recognise that we provide more than just electronic gadgets. diapers, stainless steel food containers, digital bathroom scales and even make-up are some of our popular products, says ressel. since lazada malaysia started in 2012, it has seen a huge shift in the demographic of online shoppers toward an older, more diverse group. today, over 55% of lazadas customers are female and the median age is 30 and above, compared with the early days when most of its shoppers were younger. in a similar vein, 11street malaysia ceo hoseok kim says malaysias nascent e-commerce market still offers countless opportunities for offline businesses. one opportunity that kim sees is more local businesses venturing online by applying an omni-channel strategy, operating online and offline businesses concurrently. however, kim acknowledges that offline sellers and brands in malaysia are hindered by the lack of knowledge on how to operate online. one of the main challenges is that offline businesses do not know how to start an online business  from building a website, setting up payment methods, delivering products, linking sales to inventory management, managing consumer complaints and so on, kim says. 11streets strategy to win more shoppers is to embark on a mobile-heavy strategy, grow its product offerings and offer competitive prices. kim points out that consumers who shop on their personal computers and those who shop via mobile phone have vastly different behaviours. on pcs, most people look for specific things to buy, searching for the products they need. mobile shoppers mostly do not have anything in particular that they want to buy. they browse to explore what there is, simply because they enjoy shopping. from this behaviour, we can see that mobile shopping is fast becoming a lifestyle as you can do it anytime, anywhere, says kim. 11street is increasing its focus on mobile shopping by enhancing the user experience via well-curated mobile content among other initiatives. where, then, does it leave a smaller, new entrant like astro go shop? its model is slightly different from the other b2c players as it leverages its broadcast and media platforms to sell products via infomercials. astro go shop ceo grace lee says the pay-tv provider is banking on its media platforms to reach a potential customer base of about five million households or an average of 20 million individuals. astro go shop has malay and chinese language channels in malaysia that are broadcast around the clock on astro pay-tv, astro on the go

a multiple similar to the one used in the initial acquisition, edotco groups chief executive officer, suresh sidhu, told the edge financial daily. recall that edotco group through its wholly-owned subsidiary, edotco investments (labuan) ltd, acquired a 75% stake in edotco investments singapore pte ltd (formerly known as digicel asian holdings pte ltd) from ysh finance ltd on dec 4 last year for us$125 million. this translated into an enterprise value of rm221 million. edotco singapore wholly owns edotco myanmar (formerly digicel myanmar tower company ltd), while ysh finance is controlled by singapore-listed yoma strategic holdings ltd. as part of the acquisition last year, edotco investments entered into a put and call option agreement with ysh finance for the sale and purchase of the remaining 25% stake in edotco singapore. if axiata fully exercised the call option, it would take full control of edotco singapore and edotco myanmar. however, edotco investments is only exercising half the call options. note that the put and call option agreement will also be terminated once axiata completes the acquisition of the 12.5% stake in edotco singapore. axiata has the first right of refusal for the remaining 12.5% stake, which will be transacted on a willing buyer, willing seller basis, said suresh. the option was to expire five years from signing. it fixed the exercise price of the 25% stake at the higher of us$40.25 million or the future enterprise valuation based on a pre-agreed multiple of edotco myanmars trailing 12-month ebitda. in the filing with bursa malaysia, axiata also noted that the acquisition price of the 12.5% stake also took into account the assignment and transfer of outstanding loans advanced by ysh finance to edotco singapore. axiata shares rose 0.21% to rm4.81 yesterday. at current level, they are valued at 21.96 times historical earnings, with a market capitalisation of rm42.9 billion. year to date, the stock has fallen 24.96%."}, "66": {"date_posted": "22/9/2016", "title": "klci rises 0.66% on fed interest rate cheer", "article": " kuala lumpur (sept 22): like most of its regional brethren, the fbm klci closed in the green territory today after the us federal reserve (fed) confirmed it was maintaining interest rates. by 5pm, the local benchmark was up by 10.93 points or 0.66% to settle at 1,669.66 points. supporting the benchmark index's rise today were ammb holdings bhd, astro malaysia holdings bhd, axiata group bhd, cimb group holdings bhd, and digi.com bhd. jf apex securities bhd senior analyst lee cherng wee said share markets in the region, malaysia's included, were propped up as investors cheered fed's decision to not raise interest rates in the us. \"but whether there could be profit-taking tomorrowu2026 it's not like the market has been up so much recently,\" he told theedgemarkets.com over telephone. from last thursday's (sept 15) close of 1,652.99 points, the klci has gained 16.67 points or 1.01% so far this week. apart from maintaining borrowing costs, the fed yesterday also revised down its projection for growth in the world's biggest economy this year to 1.8%, down 20 basis points from june. across bursa malaysia today, a total of 2.11 billion shares valued at rm2.23 billion were traded. gainers outsized decliners, at 529 and 313 respectively. sc estate builder bhd, formerly known as flonic hi-tec bhd, was today's most actively traded counter. runner-ups were sanichi technology bhd and rhb investment bank bhd's european-style call warrant for uem sunrise bhd. today's biggest gainers included british american tobacco (malaysia) bhd, concrete engineering products bhd, and kesm industries bhd. the biggest decliners were dutch lady milk industries bhd, atlan holdings bhd, and panasonic manufacturing malaysia bhd. regionally, hong kong's hang seng index was up by 0.39%, korea's kospi gained 0.67% and australia's s&p/asx 200 rose by 0.65%. china's shanghai stock exchange composite index also climbed 0.54%, while the shenzhen stock exchange composite index added 0.63%. neighbouring singapore's straits times index, however, fell by 0.16%, and japan markets are closed for holiday today.

earlier, had a higher target price of rm1.02 apiece. although both securities had retraced their gains at the time of writing, kenanga and rhb still have buy calls on the company. we like ock for its healthy cash flow on the back of its escalating recurring income trend, the spreading of its wings in myanmar and across southeast asia, its ability to ride the passive infrastructure sharing trend, its ebitda margin expanding trend and its potential growth through m&a (mergers and acquisitions), kenanga says in a note on may 5. investors who have a higher risk appetite could consider leveraging the groups warrants rather than its ordinary shares, it adds. the research house values the warrants at 44 sen based on the black-scholes options pricing model at its 95 sen target price. ock-wa has a

rm29.2 million in fy2016 on the back of a higher contribution from telecommunications services. net profit for fy2017, however, is expected to grow marginally by 1.1% to rm29.5 million as a result of higher depreciation cost incurred after the full-year rental income contribution from its myanmar project, it says. the research house expects ocks recurring income to hit rm92 million in fy2016 and

player's outlook remains challenging due to intense competition as celcom axiata bhd strives to regain market share, while maxis bhd continues to expand in the migrant workers segment. \"digi recorded another quarter of healthy prepaid (an increase of 149,000) and postpaid (an increase of 62,000) net adds, driven by new promotions launched in 1qfy16,\" he said. \"earnings before interest, tax,

rm479.22 million a year earlier. the decline in profitability was on the back of a 7.7% decline in revenue for the quarter to rm1.65 billion compared to the rm1.79 billion reported in 1qfy15. the group saw service revenue falling 1.8% y-o-y to rm1.56 billion but this was offset by a 6.9% increase in postpaid service revenue. however, the group had incurred higher depreciation and amortisation as well as higher finance costs which offset foreign exchange and derivatives gains of rm9.28 million, as opposed to a loss of rm6.09 million in the previous year. digi declared a first interim dividend of 5.1 sen per share, payable on june 24. foong said digi's results were slightly below expectations as ebitda was largely flat q-o-q in 1qfy16, with better margins offsetting lower revenue. he also said on a y-o-y basis, ebitda was down 9.1% due to intense market competition and weaker ringgit against the us dollar rate, adding that ebitda and core net profit was slightly below the research firm's and consensus fy16 forecasts of 23%. the research firm upgraded the stock to \"hold\" from \"reduce\" with lower fy16/fy17/fy18 core earnings per share by 5.8%/6.4%/8% (ebitda by a

{"date_posted": "25/3/2016", "title": "checking companies for dividend vigour", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on march 7 - 13, 2016. rising dividend payments are traditionally equated with balance sheet strength, but the smart investor knows that is not always the case. some learnt the hard way, having bought into companies that were paying shareholders using future earnings and borrowings instead of just returning excess cash. others knew some dividend streams were unsustainable but bought the stocks anyway because of their thirst for yield during times of ultra-low interest rates. they helped chased prices of these so-called quasi cash cows higher but not all escaped with profits when reality dawned. investors who have wised up are questioning the sustainability of dividends as growth gets tougher to find amid rising costs and industry-wide landscape changes, which threaten future earnings that are needed to fuel continued dividend payments. a stretched balance sheet (read high net debt) is another clue that historical increases in dividend payments are no assurance of dividend payments going forward. yield stocks remain sought after even as the world grapples with the impact of negative interest rates. and investment premiums have risen considerably, just over seven years after the us federal reserve announced its first quantitative easing (qe1) programme in late 2008. in malaysia, there is added reason to seek safety in dividends. an uptick in political uncertainties following tun dr mahathir mohamads resignation from umno could dampen the ringgits positive momentum, uob kay hian malaysia head of research vincent khoo says in a march 2 note. he advises clients to stay defensive and focus on dividend yield plays. his list of attractive quality high-dividend yielders includes malayan banking bhd (maybank), hong leong industries bhd, igb reit and carlsberg brewery malaysia bhd, with yields ranging from 5.9% to 6.3%. uob kay hian also has a buy on guinness anchor bhd. meanwhile, maybank investment bank research tells its clients that 2016 earnings could be down 2% for guinness anchor and 2.7% for carlsberg on the assumption that volumes will contract 0.3% (the same quantum as 2003 when excise duty was raised 10%) due to an expected tax hike on alcohol from march 1. its report, also dated march 2, forecasts a dividend yield of at least 6% for carlsberg (hold, rm13 target price) and guinness anchor (buy, rm15 target price), with no change in expectations pending further clarity from management. the tax hike, while expected, is one example of how earnings  and in turn dividend payments  could be affected by operating changes. a quick search found 140 stocks that have above the fbm klcis 3.4% average yield for 2017 (3.16% for 2016), according to bloomberg data at the time of writing. of these, 62 have yields above 5% and these include the five stocks mentioned so far: maybank (5.85%), hong leong industries (5.61%), igb reit (5.62%), carlsberg (5.87%) and guinness anchor (6.46%). the last is among only 30 companies with above 6% yield, bloomberg data shows. those familiar with bloomberg knows it has proprietary analytic functions and limitations. and the yield figures cited here is largely a function of consensus analyst forecasts, coupled with the latest historical reported financial figures, which may not be reflective going forward if the companies balance sheets are stretched or if there is a significant change in operating conditions or inherent competitiveness. that is not to say these figures cannot be relied upon, but rather, that investors need to do a lot more work to be certain that the yields they want will continue to come. even the safe bet telekom malaysia bhd  the only stock on bursa malaysia that has a minimum dividend payout promise of rm700 million or up to 90% of its annual profits  is going through a rough patch as it puts its foot back into the mobile business, a segment spun off into the current axiata group bhd in 2009. for now, due to confidence in the dividend promise, yield has compressed to 2.87% at its rm6.63 close last thursday, assuming its payout falls nearer to rm700 million (19 sen per share) this year. yield was 3.11% on the same assumptions at its recent low of rm6.10 a share last august. there will be periodic market imperfections, but as the maxim goes, higher gains often come with higher risk. it is worth noting that seven of the 12 stocks with yields of above 7% (according to bloomberg data) are real estate investment trusts (reits), which need to pay out over 90% of their earnings as dividends in order to get tax pass-through benefits. simply put, whatever their real cash needs are, reits have to pay out 90% of its annual profits to avoid paying corporate tax  just one exception to the adage of consistent dividend payers being cash-rich companies. while reits can provide stable cash flow, they can be faced with a dilemma when their assets age and need refurbishment if costs are higher than their cash reserves  one which can lead to asset sales or a rights issue. business trusts, which do not have a minimum dividend threshold but are allowed to pay them even without having profits, would fall under a similar category of dividend payers that are not necessarily cash rich. rather than a reward to shareholders, these dividend streams can, at times, be likened to interest payments. to be sure, the well-managed ones can go on for a long time and their chances are higher if the underlying assets are those that can appreciate in value rather than those with a straight-line depreciation with a definitive end-life. but even the latter can provide a learned investor with decent returns in the initial years. media companies  broadcaster and publisher media prima bhd and star media group  are also among the stocks with yields of over 7% at the time of writing. media primas portfolio contains the countrys free-to-air tv and radio stations plus three national newspapers  new straits times, berita harian and harian metro. star medias mainstay is the star english newspaper. the good news is that both companies are still in a net cash position, with the caveat being the challenges the industry is going through as consumption patterns change due to technology and the ubiquitous internet. both companies, like many others, are reining in overhead costs while investing in new sources of growth. it is worth noting that both star media and media prima have been paying out at least 50% of profits since fy2011, according to bloomberg data. while past payment track records may not necessarily reflect ability for future payments, the assumption here is that companies that have consistently been making over 50% payouts and are still in a net cash position or have low net debt, should be able to continue to make generous payments. others will have to work harder to replenish their cash positions. there are about 40 companies with yields of over 4% that have been paying out at least 50% of their profits as dividends for at least three of the past five fiscal years, a quick search on bloomberg shows (see table). of these companies, a number are still in a net cash position while at least eight of them have over two times net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda), according to bloomberg data. the latter are mrcb-quill, ytl corp bhd, capitaland malaysia malls trust, ytl hospitality reit, boustead holdings and lingkaran trans kota holdings bhd. on the other hand, those with more than two times net cash to ebitda include bursa malaysia bhd, shl consolidated bhd, star media, uchi, apollo food holdings bhd, amway malaysia bhd and elsoft research bhd. when recently asked for guidance on yield, rhb research institute executive chairman and chief economist lim chee sing says investors focus should be on stocks with improved business model, reasonable earnings visibility, strong cash flows, a dividend policy put in place and, hence, sustainable dividend payments. of course, one cannot ignore valuations as well, as rich valuation stocks are still susceptible to selldowns should global economy take another turn for the worse, adds lim. these words are worth pondering over as one seeks out the right defensive stocks to bolster his portfolio.

eg services bhd (myeg) saw some choppy trade following news that the government had frozen recruitment of foreign workers.  its share price is down 7% from its five-year high of rm2.30 on jan 11. news that the government had decided to suspend the recruitment of all foreign workers to malaysia as it reviews the current pool of foreign labour in the country sent myegs share price tumbling nearly 5% to close at rm2.06 on feb 19 as investors were worried that the freeze would affect the e-government service providers earnings outlook. it closed three sen or 1.39% lower at rm2.13 last friday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm5.12 billion. analysts, however, believe that it is a knee-jerk reaction, with cimb research advising investors to take this short-term share price weakness as an opportunity to accumulate the stock. the news [of the foreign worker freeze] is negative as investors have been factoring in [the] income stream from higher foreign labour registration via new intakes or the amnesty programme. there could be some follow-through modest selling pressure, uob-kay hian head of research vincent khoo told the edge financial daily. however, he opined that the negative impact is likely to be temporary, as the suspension will be eventually lifted given malaysias labour requirement. myeg on feb 11 announced that it had been appointed by the home ministry to manage the rehiring programme for illegal foreign workers. this was an enhancement contract to the appointment letter dated sept 4, 2015. the group had told bursa malaysia that this project would take effect from feb 15 to aug 15, and was expected to contribute positively to its earnings for the financial years ending june 30, 2016 and 2017. no value was disclosed, as myeg said it is dependent on the number of illegal foreign workers successfully registered. there is no official data on the number of illegal workers in malaysia, but it is believed to be in the range of two million to four million. while the number of illegal workers to be legalised by the government is unclear now, it should not be lesser than the number recorded under the previous 6p programme of 1.3 million workers, said khoo. based on our rough estimate, processing one million illegal workers could lift myegs revenue by rm100 million, he added. khoo also recognised that the potential contribution from the illegal worker registration is significant, estimating that by handling one million illegal worker registrations, net profit could come in at rm50 million (trailing-12-month net profit: rm84 million). as for the courier service licence, he is of the view that the contribution would be small at the beginning stage, but this is a low-hanging fruit for myeg as it is tapping its existing infrastructure (delivery of road tax) to run this new business. however, khoo opined that these near-term prospects had already been priced in. we note that there could be other potential earnings growth angles, such as its tie-up with celcom axiata bhd in providing sim cards to foreign workers. myegs share price would be sustainable should it show its capability in rolling out its new projects on hand, khoo added. he believes that myeg has thus far shown its ability to clinch contracts and execute its contracts smoothly. prospects remain positive. opportunities lie in its ability to build more value-added services for its growing database of customers, he said. for cimb research, it believes that investors should take this short-term share price weakness as an opportunity to accumulate myeg shares. potential rerating catalysts include stronger-than-expected registration of illegal foreign workers and [a] successful launch of the customs service tax monitoring project in mid-2016, it said

plunge since its major weekly wave-5 and all-time high of rm3.09 on jan 11, 2016. since that rm3.09 high, flb has fallen to its recent low of rm2.01 this month. as prices broke above their recent key critical support levels of rm2.32 and rm2.69, look to sell flb on any rallies to its resistance areas, as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to medium-term downtrend for this stock. the daily indicators (like the cci, dmi, oscillator, stochastic and macd) have issued clear sell signals, and now show firm and obvious indications of flbs eventual decline towards lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at resistance levels of rm2.07, rm2.32 and rm2.69. we expect flb to witness weak buying activities at its support levels of rm1.75, rm1.87 and rm2.01. its downside

mobile eyes ipo and ebitda positive by 2018", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on january 4 - january 10, 2016.  the long-awaited initial public offering (ipo) of u mobile sdn bhd, the countrys youngest telecommunications operator, could take place within the next two to three years. this, however, can only happen if the loss-making company manages to break even within that time frame. launched in 2007, u mobile has made an impact on the market as its subscriber base grew from less than 50,000 to over four million in less than five years. over the years, it has been seen as a serious challenger to the big three telcos  maxis bhd, digi.com bhd and celcom axiata bhd. according to ceo wong heang tuck, his immediate target is to make u mobile ipo-able by 2018, as the company is expected to become ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) positive by then. we are targeting ebitda break-even and ipo in about two to three years. by then, we would have grown much bigger in size. of course, if we do well, the plan will be accelerated, he tells the edge in an interview.  wong was appointed ceo in april 2014. since he joined the company as chief operating officer in 2013, u mobiles revenue and market growth have outperformed the industry average. previously, wong was chief financial officer of wbl corp ltd, a singapore-listed multinational conglomerate. he has more than two decades of experience in finance, business and corporate development. u mobile is, today, the fourth largest mobile operator in malaysia, with a market share of close to 8%. wong says it is aiming for a double-digit market share in the coming years, which should help it build its profit track record, or at least, break even. ebitda positive is a key milestone for us before we do the ipo, because that will give investors confidence, he says. however, he declines to reveal u mobiles ebitda figures. a quick check on the companies commission of malaysias website shows that u mobiles net loss contracted to rm191.82 million in its financial year ended dec 31, 2014 (fy2014) from rm363.24 million in fy2013. revenue rose from rm919.17 million to rm1.26 billion. u mobile has allocated a capital expenditure (capex) of rm3 billion to rm4 billion for its five-year expansion plan, mainly to expand its third generation (3g) and fourth generation long-term evolution (4g lte) network infrastructure by rolling out 5,000 new base stations to cover the whole country. to date, it owns 3,200 network sites for 3g and 1,281 sites for 4g. it also has 1,880 network sites for 3g that are shared with maxis.  we are not going for a listing for the sake of going for a listing. yes, our [current] shareholders are a source of funds, but eventually, we need multiple sources of funds, he says. he adds that the most efficient way to raise funds is through a combination of capital market, equity market and loan market. in order to tap these sources of funds, the best way is to go for a listing. a telco is like a utility firm. investment in technology is a must; the day the telco stops investing is the day it dies, he explains. while it is still too early to tell how big the ipo will be, wong acknowledges that the five-year capex plan will tap into the ipo funds. maybe 25% to 30% will be fresh funds coming from the equity market. once we go for a listing, we can have a series of bond and loan [issuance]. on u mobiles listing destination, he says the priority is bursa malaysia. however, he did not rule out the possibility of floating its shares on other stock exchanges, including singapore and jakarta, as well as a primary listing in shanghai, china, and a secondary listing in kuala lumpur. if you look at the regionalbourses today, malaysia has the best valuation for telcos, be it ebitda multiple or price-earnings ratio. but three years later, i wouldnt know, he says. currently, straits mobile investments pte ltd, a unit of singapore technologies telemedia, is the single largest shareholder of u mobile with a 49% stake. u telemedia sdn bhd, a private investment by local tycoon tan sri vincent tan chee yioun, is the second largest shareholder with a 21.46% stake. tan, who is the chairman of u mobile, also has a 6.2% direct stake in u mobile as well as 2.01% equity interest via berjaya infrastructure sdn bhd. it is worth noting that u mobile on dec 18 announced that sultan of johor sultan ibrahim sultan iskandar has acquired an additional 5% stake in the company, raising his holding to 15%. sultan ibrahim acquired his initial 10% stake in u mobile in 2014. locally listed magnum bhd also has a 6.33% stake in u mobile. low-profile thai-born tycoon tan sri surin upatkoon,

digitaledge weekly, on september 14 - 20, 2015.   according to former communications and multimedia minister datuk seri ahmad shabery cheek, malaysias e-commerce industry, which was worth rm53 billion in 2014, is expected to grow to rm72 billion this year and rm88 billion in 2016. as more and more consumers use the internet to make purchases, one of the biggest beneficiaries of this trend is the logistics industry, which is involved in the unglamorous back-end work of delivering the goods purchased. the rise of the online retail shopping segment  both the business-to-consumer and customer-to-customer  has been the driving force of the burgeoning courier service industry, says rhb research analyst ahmad maghfur usman in a july 14 report. while rising competition between online shopping companies could put pressure on costs and consequently, squeeze margins for courier service providers, on the upside, this could bring about more volume for courier service providers and, hence, drive economies of scale further. while it is difficult to assess how much of what is being handled by courier companies is e-commerce-related, the general volume of parcels handled by the countrys postal and courier service industry has increased drastically over the last few years. data from the malaysian communications and multimedia commission shows that the postal service delivered 1.26 million parcels domestically last year, doubling 2013s 662,681 deliveries. courier traffic for parcels reached 15.29 million domestically last year, growing threefold from the 5.27 million parcels seen in 2012. internationally, courier firms in malaysia handled 4.07 million parcels last year, up from 1.83 million in 2012. more telling of e-commerce as a catalyst for the logistics industry, though, is the investment and capital expenditure courier companies are willing to undertake to capture a share of the e-commerce market. for example, bursa malaysia-listed gd express carrier bhd (gdex) (fundamental: 3; valuation: 0.70) incurred rm10.21 million in capital expenditure in its financial year ended june 30, 2014, to cope with greater demand for its delivery services. in that year, the company expanded its vehicle fleet from 297 to 453, increasing its capacity to 1,005 tonnes from 807 tonnes. it also increased its manpower from 2,013 workers to 2,315, to cope with the surge in demand for its express delivery services. gdexs express delivery segment posted a profit of rm24.48 million in fy2014, a 13.4% improvement from a year ago. the segment contributed 91% to the firms profit, with the remaining 9% coming from logistics services. according to gdex managing director teong teck lean, the company has been improving the quality of its services to fit into the business model of e-commerce firms in order to ride the boom. there are several factors that contributed to the growth of e-commerce. retailers are embarking on different channels to reach out to their customers, and we believe that the internet is one of the channels they are focusing on. for new start-ups, selling through the internet is easier, as opposed to the traditional bricks-and-mortar retailing, he says. delivery of goods to customers is one of the key factors of a successful e-commerce business, and we fit in perfectly as the service provider for these players. e-commerce-related business contributes about 15% to our revenue and is growing rapidly. the volume growth is very encouraging. similarly, pos malaysia bhd (fundamental: 2.20: valuation: 0.90), which has seen an erosion of profits from its core mail business due to declining mail volume, is now spending more on growing its courier, express and parcel (cep) business. this segment, which contributed 30% or rm480 million to the companys revenue in its financial year ended march 31, 2015, has been growing in tandem with the increase in e-commerce transactions. pos malaysia group ceo azlan shahrim has also described the cep segment as the main driver of the companys growth. this explains the concerted effort made by the company to improve its pos laju services. pos laju has expanded its physical courier infrastructure by providing ad hoc kiosks, commenced operating on the first saturday of each month and on public holidays and invested in fuel-efficient vehicles, mobile scanners and a bigger workforce to ensure it keeps its courier market share. it has also introduced innovative products like ezipoz  a reverse logistics service to complement e-commerce transactions. ezipoz provides online shoppers in malaysia with a street address in the us, allowing them to buy from retailers that do not ship their products outside the us. even for those who are not in the courier business yet, the e-commerce-related revenue is starting to look tempting. e-commerce is something we are looking into closely, says tiong nam logistics holdings bhd, which has expertise in warehousing and customs forwarding. as a total logistics solution provider with our extensive expertise in door-to-door micro-distribution deliveries, tiong nam (fundamental: 1.10; valuation: 2.40) will definitely take advantage of this trend to provide a healthy supply chain for deliveries. other players that have been touted as potential newcomers to the last-mile delivery market by analysts are tasco bhd (fundamental: 1.80; valuation: 1.40), freight management holdings bhd (fundamental: 1.40; valuation: 1.80) and ingenuity consolidated bhd (fundamental: 0.95; valuation: 0.90). with just

wednesday as a slump in commodity prices reignited investor fears of slowing global growth. softer economic data from china and europe spilled over into the american markets and the s&p 500 index fell 3.98 points to 1,938.76, while the dow jones industrial average declined 50.58 points to end at 16,279.89. in malaysia, the fbm klci moved in a wider range of 52.12 points for the week with lower volumes of 1.6 billion to 1.99 billion shares traded. the index closed at 1,613.17 on wednesday, down 22.2 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like axiata group bhd, genting bhd, hong leong financial group bhd, kuala lumpur kepong bhd, public bank bhd and sime darby bhd caused the index to tumble on heavy selling activities. the ringgit was much weaker against the us dollar at 4.3440 as brent crude remained steady at us$47.60 (rm208.96) per barrel. the index rose on a rally from a 801.27 low (october 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014), and this represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements after july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,837.28 (low), 1,879.62 (high), 1,766.22 (low), 1,858.09 (high), 1,671.82 (low), 1,810.21 (high), 1,706.18 (low), 1,831.41 (high), 1,774.3 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,685.03 (low), 1,744.19 (high), 1,503.68 (low) and 1,691.93 (high). the indexs daily signals have turned mixed, with its cci, dmi and stochastic indicators showing sell signals, but the macd and oscillator are positive for now. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at the 1,503, 1,567 and 1,609 levels, while profit-taking in the resistance areas of 1,613, 1,661 and 1,691 will cap the indexs advances. the klcis 18-day and 40-day simple moving averages (smas) depict an emerging downtrend for its short-term daily chart. the indexs price bars are also below the 50-day and 200-day smas, and this depicts a softer phase for the medium- to longer-term moving averages. due to the softer tone of the klci, we are recommending a chart sell on umw holdings bhd (umw). a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that 18 research houses cover the stock, with no buy call, 10 hold calls and eight sell calls. maybank investment banks analyst has a hold call on umw, with a sum-of-parts-based target price of rm7.80 as its first half of financial year 2015 (fy15) earnings of rm225 million were below expectations. the key disappointments in its second quarter of fy15 earnings were in the auto and oil and gas (o&g) divisions, where higher us dollar-denominated costs hit the auto division and underutilisation of its jack-up rigs affected the o&g division. umws chart trends in the daily, weekly and monthly time frames are very firmly down. its share price made an obvious plunge since its major weekly wave-5 high of rm12.23 in august 2014. since that rm12.23 high, umws share price fell to its recent low of rm7.70 this month. as prices broke above its recent key critical support levels of rm9.72 and rm8.84, look to sell umw on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to medium-term downtrend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi and oscillator) have issued clear sell signals, and now depict firm indications of umws eventual plunge to lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm7.77, rm8.84 and rm9.72. we expect umw to witness weak buying in its support areas of rm6.74, rm7.02 and rm7.70. its downside targets are located at rm5.85, rm4.55 and rm1.98.  lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed in the article are the opinions of the writer and should not be construed as investment

skewed towards supporting the stock market, rather than boosting the economy, according to cimb investment bank bhd. in a note today, cimb said the spotlight was on the rm20 billion allocation for government-owned valuecap sdn bhd to buy undervalued shares here. \"the measures announced by the pm have two broad objectives, i.e. stabilise financial markets and support domestic businesses. just like any other measure to support a beleaguered stock market, the impact was immediate and the ringgit recovered slightly. the measures to support the real economy pale in comparison, given the size of funds. the intended impact on the markets may not last, amidst prevalent volatility. any sustained positive effects would be reflected more in the domestic real economy; albeit marginally and with a time lag,\" cimb said. according to valuecap's website, the company is equally-owned by khazanah nasional bhd, kumpulan wang persaraan (diperbadankan) and permodalan nasional bhd. valuecap operates via two subsidiaries. they are vcap asset managers sdn bhd  a conventional fund management entity; and i-vcap management sdn bhd, which manages funds based on islamic principals. yesterday (sept 14), najib also announced measures to strengthen the domestic economy. these include establishing more goverment-owned convenience stores and clinics and encouraging malaysian companies abroad to repatriate their profits and invest the money here. today, cimb said the economic measures were not enough to catalyse the domestic economy, as consumers contended with the impact of the goods and services tax (gst) and weakening ringgit. both factors have led to costlier goods here. as the economy is not facing any threat of a sharp slowdown like that seen in the last global financial crisis and asian financial crisis, the government is not under pressure to act with big economic stimulus. \"nonetheless, with the rapid decline in the ringgit, some businesses, especially the smes, are feeling the pinch at a time when they are still struggling with costs associated with the gst. hence, the measures announced are more targeted towards this group,\" cimb said. meanwhile, hong leong investment bank said in its note that value big cap stocks could be in focus, following najib's announcement yesterday. hong leong said the list included axiata group bhd, digi.com bhd, ijm corp bhd, malayan banking bhd and tenaga nasional bhd. \"this would expedite our expectation of switch in focus to value big caps (albeit yesterdays surge). \"repatriation of glcs (government-linked companies) funds could result in more stable myr, culminating in lower appetite for export-oriented stocks,\" hong leong said.

the rm500 million it achieved in fy15, amid the generally weaker market sentiments. we will scale back our launches. we are cautious about the market next year, as there are a lot of uncertainties, titijayas deputy group managing director (md) lim poh yit told reporters during a media briefing today. lim said there will be three launches in fy16, which will have a collective gross development value of rm400 million. these launches are: two residential projects  one each in ara damansara and cheras  and a commercial project in shah alam. lim also said titijaya is changing its land banking strategy by embarking on developments through partnerships to share risks and preserve cash flow. as at fy16, the group has a total land bank of 432 acres, valued at rm8.6 billion. symphony life bhd said performance for current financial year ending march 31, 2016 (fy16) would be worse than the previous year due to slower demand. chief operating officer stewart tew said symphony life was holding back a part of the rm2 billion worth of real estate launches in the klang valley to focus on existing projects, in view of the current market. tew said many existing projects were at the foundation stage. hence, we can only realise the contribution next year. we are deferring some of our launches, due to the weakening of the property sector lately. the group is also actively on the lookout for new land bank for future development, he told reporters after the companys annual general meeting here today. tew said symphony lifes deferred launches included projects in bandar sunway and puchong,

development cost for their future projects by up to 20%, if the situation does not abate soon. costs have been going up progressively over the past two years. the past six months development has seen the weakening ringgit and this will impact future contracts awarded as part of the construction materials, some imported raw items or finishing items are quoted in us dollars. however, i dont think the cost increase will be too drastic u2026 it would be somewhere around 10% to 15% range, at most 20%. the bulk of the raw materials used for construction is locally produced. cement and steel bar are price controlled items. so most of our cost is local, said l&g md low gay teck. he said its current projects are unaffected. on whether the group will pass the price hike to their customers, low only said it will adjust the price cost accordingly. meanwhile, it does not see major concerns for its ongoing projects. even in hard times, i dont foresee major concerns for the group, because we can sell. our land banks and projects are in prime, mature housing areas. in addition to that, the group have ongoing projects, locked in sales, work in progress and unbilled sales of rm369 million, said

the key is to become a convergence champion, he tells the edge. for tm, convergence means to build and operate a seamless network that is capable of supporting all customers and anytime-anywhere-any device applications, he explains. before, whether the users were at home or in the office, they were our customers. today, even when they are outside, they can still be our customers as we have deployed wifi in many locations, such as shopping malls. the one thing that was missing was when these people were on the move or when they were in places with no access to wifi. now that p1 is part of our family, we can provide that mobility piece to complete the picture, so these customers can remain our users wherever they are. to recap, in march last year, tm (fundamental: 0.80; valuation: 1.10), green packet bhd (fundamental: 1.10; valuation: 0.30) and south korea-based sk telecom co ltd (skt) established a partnership framework to jointly invest in p1. tms initial investment was rm350 million to subscribe for a 57% stake in p1 and rm210 million to pump into green packets newly issued medium-term notes (mtn), which may be exchanged for green packets stake in p1 at a later date. to date, tm has invested close to rm120 million of the rm210 million mtn. the remaining rm90 million is expected to be used this year. the acquisition of p1 was completed last september with tm controlling 55.3%, green packet 31.1% and skt 13.6%. with regard to funding commitments, the mtn programme provides p1 with the avenue to raise future funds of up to rm1.65 billion in tranches, of which tm is entitled to subscribe for up to rm990 million within three years. the proceeds raised via the programme will be utilised to finance the implementation of p1s business plan, which will involve the rollout of a long-term evolution (lte) network. when tms shares were trading at around rm7.20, publicinvest research analyst lee wee sieng, in a june 1 report, warned that the stock had overvalued the potential of its new wireless business, which carried execution risks. commenting on the impact of p1s losses on tms financial performance, zamzamzairani says the acquisition must be given time to reap rewards for the group. when you acquire a company, of course, there will be the integration cost, which you will have to bear. this is not a surprise; we knew that was going to happen. what is more important is how we turn p1 around. the compelling story is that we now will be able to provide converged services, which we couldnt before. but it has been nine months since the acquisition and the management teams of tm, green packet and p1 still cannot say when p1 will become profitable. most research analysts expect tms earnings to continue to be weighed down by p1s losses in the coming quarters, if not the coming years. however, zamzamzairani says they have their own time frame. there is only so much we can share openly. just wait and see. we are working hard on integration and we have already put in a strong management team in p1. the actual business plan may seem sketchy at the moment but it is learnt that p1 is making a transition from fixed wireless broadband provider to digital mobile telecommunications player providing 4g-lte services. although it appears that p1 may fight with the big 3  maxis, digi and celcom  for market share, zamzamzairani clarifies that tm is not positioning itself as a mobile operator. tm is not going to be the fourth mobile service provider. we will be the no 1 in convergence but that would include us providing pure mobile services through p1, he says, adding that with tms backing, p1 has a strong chance of returning to the black. the p1 story is not just a p1 story anymore. it is now a tm story. it is a member of our family. now, investors will be left wondering about the companys future dividend payout, considering the huge capital expenditure for p1 and phase 2 of hsbb in the coming years. while the acquisition of p1 shows that tm is making a comeback to the mobile service sector, it is worth noting that the telecoms industry has evolved over the years  the mobile service sector has passed its high-growth phase in terms of penetration. the question now is, how much will tm, a fixed line service operator, eventually benefit from its push into wireless business through p1? it is noteworthy that tms financial performance and dividend payout are constantly in the limelight because it is 28.95%-owned by sovereign wealth fund khazanah nasional bhd and 15.07%-owned by the countrys largest retirement fund, the employees provident fund. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers. a score of 3 suggests strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. visit www.theedgemarkets.com for more details on a companys financial dashboard. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on july 6 - 12, 2015.

sectors price-earnings ratio versus the fbm klci suggested that the sector downside is limited from here. on the corporate front, telekom malaysia bhd (tm) and digi.com bhd could have reached or be close to their temporary bottom, while maxis bhd and axiata group bhd may have another 2% to 4% downside from here. competition in the mobile prepaid and post-paid segments appears to be escalating following the recent launch of various aggressive offers by incumbents. these could potentially lead to higher operating costs and lower margins moving forward. valuation-wise, while we make no change to our telco companies financial year 2015 (fy15) to fy16 earnings estimates, we have trimmed all our celcos targeted standard deviation (sd) levels by 0.5 times each to account for the challenges ahead, as well as shifting our valuation base year to fy16. valuations for tm (target price (tp): rm7.80), meanwhile, remain unchanged as we had rolled over our valuation base year previously. we reiterate our outperform call on tm and digi (tp: rm6.69, down from rm6.87 previously) while keeping our market perform call on axiata (tp: rm6.55, down from rm6.77 previously), and maxis (tp: rm6.68, down from rm7.06 previously). tm remains our favourite pick for the sector given that there is less competition in its fixed-line broadband business, potential better-than-expected synergies from p1, and more traction from high-speed broadband phase 2 and sub-urban broadband projects. meanwhile, we continue to favour digi among the telcos due to its higher operational efficiency and better competency in monetising data. redtones stock rating, on the other hand, has been raised to outperform following the recent share price weakness. its target price, however, remains unchanged at 87

decline on some obvious liquidation activities. the ringgit was a touch weaker against the us dollar at 3.6020 as brent crude oil turned weaker at us$64.70 (rm232.92) per barrel. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (oct 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,837.28 (low), 1,879.62 (high), 1,766.22 (low), 1,858.09 (high), 1,671.82 (low), 1,810.21 (high), 1,706.18 (low), 1,831.41 (high), 1,774.30 (low) and 1,867.53 (high). all the indexs daily signals are negative for now, with its cci, dmi, macd, stochastic and oscillator indicators showing much weaker readings. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at the 1,770, 1,774 and 1,793 levels, while the resistance areas of 1,795, 1,823 and 1,867 will cap any index rebound. the klcis 18 and 40 simple moving averages (sma) depict an emerging downtrend with a dead cross for its daily chart. the recent price bars of the index have just turned below the 50 and 200 sma. as such, the index remains on its downturn from its recent 1,867.53 high in late april. upon a break of the critical intermediate support of 1,795, the index may head towards its next downside targets of 1,780, 1,764 and 1,727. due to the poorer tone for the klci index, we are recommending a chart sell on uem sunrise bhd (uems). looking at the most recent fourth quarter financial year 2014 (4qfy14) result announcement, the group recorded higher revenues compared with the preceding year in the same quarter to rm1.341 billion from rm573.1 million in 4qfy13. gerbang land sales to fastrack iskandar sdn bhd of rm248 million and scope energy sdn bhd of rm522.7 million contributed to the higher revenue. correspondingly, profit before tax was also higher in 4qfy14 compared with 4qfy13. looking at the full 12 months financial year 2014 estimate (12mfy14e) compared with 12mfy13e, profit before tax was lower due to lower margins from land sales despite better revenues generated. however, this was mitigated by higher profits from property development. a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that 20 research houses cover the stock. of the 20 reports, there are six buy, 12 hold and two sell calls on uems. the stock currently trades at a reasonable and low historical price earnings ratio of 11 times. its price-to-book value ratio of 0.83 times indicates that its share price is trading at a discount to its book value while uems has an indicative dividend yield of 2.45%. uemss chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly timeframes are very firmly down. its share price made an obvious plunge since its major weekly wave-2 high of rm3.09 on july 19, 2013. since that high, uems has tumbled to its may 2015 recent low of rm1.16. as prices broke above its recent key critical support levels of rm1.44 and rm1.29, look to sell uems on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short-to-longer term down-trend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, oscillator and stochastic) have issued clear sell signals and now depict firm indications of uemss eventual plunge towards lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm1.16, rm1.29 and rm1.44. we expect uems to witness weaker buying at its support areas of rm0.89, rm1.05 and rm1.14. its downside targets are located at rm0.93, rm0.78 and rm0.44. lee cheng

exchange losses and increasing depreciation costs. revenue in 1qfy15 however, increased 5.2% to rm4.75 billion, from rm4.51 billion a year ago, driven by strong revenue growth from its business in bangladesh and sri lanka. the groups data revenue continues to grow exceptionally well, with all operating companies posting great traction in the segment. the quarter also saw the group investing more than rm1 billion in capital expenditure, primarily towards strengthening the data network, axiata (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.1) said in a statement today. on outlook, axiata warns of a challenging performance for the first half ending june 30, 2015 (1hfy15), on competitive pressures and adverse foreign currency fluctuations. however, axiata noted it may see improved performance in

higher progressive billing of its property division, which was almost doubled. its revenue soared 67% to rm165 million, from the rm98.78 million in the year before. despite the higher earnings, its group ceo jeffrey chew said 2015 will be a challenging year, due to many different factors which dampen the publics appetite for the property sector. he added that the groups strategy moving forward, will be to make the most of opportunities that the property and education division has to provide. chew sees an upside potential in the property sector, as the government is making home ownership more affordable, and improved connectivity is opening up new areas of growth in greater klang valley. tune ins holdings bhds net profit fell 14.4% to rm16.5 million in the first quarter ended mar 31, 2015

its associate in taiwan whose performance continues to meet expectations. jobstreet (fundamental: 1.95; valuation: 2.4) attributed the increase to higher other operating income, interest income and share of profit of equity accounted associates, and partially negated by higher operating expenses. according to a filing to bursa malaysia, quarterly revenue went up marginally by 4.42% to rm590,000, from rm565,000 last year. following the disposal of its online job portal business to seek asia in november last year, jobstreet said the groups future prospects will depend on the performance of its

the construction division is expected to contribute to higher earnings in financial year ending june 30, 2015 (fy15), due to more efficient construction cost management; while the hotel and leisure

share in the first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1qfy15), from rm30.13 million or 2.95 sen a year ago, due to a decline in fresh fruit bunch (ffb) production and low palm oil prices. revenue for

consisting of cityneon and i.star ideas factory  increased to rm38.09 million, from rm30.92 million in 1qfy14, mainly due to higher exhibition and thematic segment revenue recognised by cityneon in the current quarter under review. shangri-la hotels (m) bhds net profit fell 8.5% to rm25.6 million in the first quarter ended mar 31, 2015, from rm27.9 million in the previous corresponding quarter. the hotel and resort groups revenue declined nearly 12% to rm120.7 million, from rm137.0 million a year earlier. in an announcement to bursa malaysia today, shangri-la said its overall financial

(reit) this year, may postpone the exercise until next year. wct's (fundamental: 0.6; valuation: 2) deputy managing director goh chin liong said the retail-based reit was \"unlikely\" to be formed

valuation: 2.1) data yield has been declining steadily, from rm41 per gb in the third quarter of fy2013 to rm30.50 per gb in the same quarter of fy2014. in the same period, celcom bhds data yield was also on a downward trend, albeit less steep than digis, falling from rm15.40 per gb to rm13.90 per gb. maxis bhd was not included in tas analysis. responding to queries from the edge via email, digi says its data yields generally decrease over time, given better efficiencies gained from newer network technologies and the growing scale of operators. but the telco believes internet adoption and usage will increase as data yield optimises over time, given that pricing adjustments allow more affordable data packages and plans. maxis and celcom did not reply to the edges queries. tas chan believes telcos are hesitant to raise data pricing aggressively due to concerns about losing subscribers. according to a research analyst, if data prices are raised, prepaid consumers who are more price-sensitive may switch to a rival telco, particularly in the foreign migrant and urban youth sub-segment. penetrating this segment and offering affordable internet plans is key to capturing the growth prospects of data, she says, adding that the segment comprises 80% of the market. telcos, she points out, are desperate for incremental market share in the prepaid segment, given its potential, the tepid overall industry growth and the cannibalisation of voice and sms by data. the research analyst recalls this having happened to axiatas (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 0.90) indonesian subsidiary pt xl axiata, which suffered from subscriber attrition after raising prices in 2013. in addition, if prices are high, this segment would most likely refrain from discretionary spending on data, she says. on the critical mass of mobile data users, chan says smartphone penetration is still moderate in malaysia, at about 50% despite recording growth. the penetration rate is expected to rise to 67% by the end of this year, according to international data corp. there is room for growth, its research manager alfie amir tells the edge. alfie concurs that with the increasing number of devices (smartphones and tablets) per person, there is even more room for growth as the tablet market is still expanding. even so, says the research analyst, critical mass is a moving target that takes into account continued network investments and data pricing. the current environment suggests that penetration levels closer to 100% will likely push telcos closer to achieving a critical mass of subscribers. she believes affordable smartphone bundles, bite-sized internet packages and data plans offered by telcos now will eventually help them gain critical mass. in fact, maxis (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 0.90) recently hiked the prices of its surfmore m1 plans in an effort to squeeze more money out of data, she notes. an analyst with a bank-backed research house believes mobile operators could improve their data value propositions, but says data yields could take some time to achieve optimal monetisation. mobile operators are experimenting with various pricing models to cater for the different needs of data subscribers. we expect data yields to improve over time, but that would depend on market dynamics.  note: the edge research's fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers. a score of 3 suggests strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. go to www.theedgemarkets.com for more details on a company's financial dashboard. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on february 16 - 22, 2015."}, "148": {"date_posted": "25/2/2015", "title": "axiata allocates rm4.8 billion for fy15 capex, among its highest", "article": " kuala lumpur (feb 25): axiata group bhd has allocated rm4.8 billion for capital expenditure (capex) in the current financial year ending dec 31, 2015 u2013 one of the highest amounts the group has set aside. speaking to reporters at a briefing this afternoon, president and group ceo datuk sri jamaludin ibrahim said axiata was being aggressive with its capex this year by allocating the full amount to data or data-related investments. \"this will predominantly be for the setting up of more base stations, fibre optics and upgrading our core network in most countries,\" he said. for fy14, axiata's capex was rm4.1 billion. on the malaysian communications and multimedia commission asking service providers to lower service charges, jamaludin said he was supportive of the measure as it would help the industry in the long run. meanwhile, jamaludin expects celcom axiata to make a full recovery from the impact of the east coast floods within a quarter or two. celcom saw 313 of its sites across the east coast affected by the floods. axiata has reported a 3% rise in fourth quarter net profit to rm594.93 million from a year earlier, as the mobile telecommunication network provider posted higher revenue from most of its global operating units. significantly higher foreign exchange (forex) gains and lower finance cost also supported profit growth, axiata (fundamental: 0.85;

valuation: 0.9) and time dotcom bhd (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 0.6), as companies are expected to expand their portfolio of services to include ict solutions. fixed-line providers are now starting to become ict providers. they are beginning to offer a few it services, rolling out these services in stages, he said. alfie explained that this is mainly due to a shift in user requirements, as enterprise users now require ict services such as cloud and data centre services, instead of just connectivity. capitalising on their existing network, fixed-line providers can potentially provide end-to-end services, ranging from fixed-line connectivity to ict solutions such as cloud and data centre services. with the expansion of their products and services, telco companies are now entering the it market. by going into the it market, they are going to triple their addressable market to rm15 billion, from their current revenue of around rm5 billion. however, it will not be an easy market for the fixed-line telcos, as the it market is currently being held by established it players like hewlett-packard, ibm and csc, he said. alfie noted that telco players in countries like australia and singapore are already competing with it players on a level playing field in providing ict products and solutions, and expects the same for malaysian companies in the future. he expects the shift in the focus of telcos to providing ict services will support the revenue growth of fixed-line companies, forecasting a 7% year-on-year expansion in 2015 to rm9.8 billion. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers. a score of 3 suggests strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. go to www.theedgemarkets.com for more details on a companys financial dashboard.  this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on february 23, 2015."}, "151": {"date_posted": "23/2/2015", "title": "u mobile on track to ipo", "article": "  kuala lumpur: u mobile sdn bhds chief executive officer wong heang tuck still doesnt have a definite answer as to when the telecommunications services provider will float its shares. but since u mobile has finally drawn earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (ebitda), it is definitely on the road to an initial public offering (ipo). after growing its subscriber base to over four million before its eighth year of business, wong believed there is more room for u mobile to grow, and could draw net profit next year. he said u mobiles target market is youths, who make up the bulk of the countrys population and are data-hungry. we can go for listing now, for sure, because weve met certain criteria [for the ipo]. but we want to ensure that when we indeed go for an ipo, we can deliver value to shareholders. we also need to achieve economies of scale and be sustainable for at least a few quarters before we can think of going public, wong said in an interview with the edge financial daily. he denied market rumour of a possible merger-and-acquisition (m&a) exercise between u mobile and redtone international bhd, both of which are affiliated with tan sri vincent tan. there are no talks with redtone. and there is no discussion on this (m&a) at the shareholders level, at least, not that i know of. as far as we at u mobile are concerned, its business as usual, wong added. late last year when tans berjaya corp bhd accumulated shares in redtone (fundamental: 2.3;

[telcos] will constantly need investment in new technologies, and technology is now updated at a much faster rate, said wong. for now, u mobiles liabilities mainly comprise vendors credit, which wong

institutions  u mobiles debt level is about 20% to 30% of its equity.  growing above the industry average also in fy13, u mobiles revenue was rm919.17 million, which was nearly double of the previous

which made up 10.3% of malaysias mobile phone market share. the report did not differentiate between active and non-active subscribers. nonetheless, on a total subscriber basis, u mobile has eaten up the market shares of the big three (digi.com bhd, maxis bhd and celcom axiata bhd) over the years (see chart), with the telco still having less than half of the subscribers of its closest competitor, digi had. last september, u mobile initiated its vision 2,000,000 campaign, in which it planned to add two million subscribers before 2014 ended. it succeeded in doing so two weeks ahead of the deadline. however, wong declined to reveal u mobiles current subscriber numbers, or its market share. he said u mobile managed to make over rm1 billion in revenue in fy14, and briefly broke even at the ebitda level. he is confident that u mobile can grow above the industry average and break new turnover record in fy15. we have a few ongoing initiatives. so maybe by the second half of this year our ebitda will turn positive. we are targeting at least next year for profit, he added. but with telco services regarded as parity products, what distinguishes u mobile from the big three players?

valuation: 0.9)s subsidiary axiata digital advertising sdn bhd (ada) is hoping to get a slice of the billion dollar digital advertising market in asia pacific via a joint venture (jv) with us-based advertising technology company adknowledge inc. the jv company, adknowledge asia pacific pte ltd (adknowledge asia), will work with businesses, advertising agencies and mobile application developers in the region to provide data-driven advertising strategies to raise brand awareness and drive sales and app installs through digital video, mobile, and social media marketing. ada has an 80% stake in the jv company, in which it has invested us$9 million (rm31.01 million). axiata digital services sdn bhd chief executive officer mohd khairil abdullah, who also oversees axiatas companies and joint ventures in digital advertising, believes that axiata could leverage on adknowledges technology to offer a better proposition to larger advertisers in the fast growing digital advertising market in the the region. khairil said he is expecting the jv to start generating revenue this year, but didnt specify a target. the revenue, he added, would be reinvested to scale up the company. the new venture comes at a time when axiatas earnings had slipped 11.75% to rm631.03 million in its third quarter ended sept 30, 2014 (3qfy14), compared with rm769.78 million in 3qfy13. khairil, however, said contribution from digital advertising to the groups earnings will still be relatively small in the foreseeable future. digital advertisement spending worldwide is expected to reach us$154.29 billion this year and asia-pacific is anticipated to be the second-largest region for the sector. the region accounted for 28.2% of total spending last year, after north america, due to the rapid adoption of smart devices and changing video viewership patterns, according to emarket.com. adknowledge asia managing director krishna krovi said the company plans to be the market leader in the region in three years. adknowledge [asia] has been in social media marketing since 2008. on youtube, it has a patent-pending technology. i dont think anyone is providing this service. so, this is one of the reasons why the jv is a good partnership. we can leverage on axiatas market, brand, knowledge, and footprint to go for a leadership position in the market, said krishna. the technology is one that customies advertisements to targeted viewers.  the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score

dividends?", "article": " kuala lumpur: prime minister datuk seri najib razaks call for government-linked corporations (glc) and government-linked investment companies (glic) to pay out more dividends may help warm investors interest in selected blue-chips. under the revised budget 2015 announced by najib last tuesday, the government is seeking an additional rm400 million in dividends from glcs and glics to help supplement its revenue amid falling crude oil prices. on the macro front, the governments urge for more dividends from such institutions would help shore up investors interests, said areca capital sdn bhd chief executive officer danny wong. with the government calling for more dividends, this could also hopefully attract foreign funds and indirectly help ease the burden of the weaker ringgit, wong told the edge financial daily. however, jf apex securities bhd senior analyst lee cherng wee said whether glcs could pay more dividends would ultimately depend on their ability to grow earnings substantially amid a tougher economic climate. already, many research houses are forecasting a mere single-digit corporate earnings growth this year. cimb research, for one, is projecting 8% growth in malaysias corporate earnings in 2015, a figure that is nothing to shout about given the projected inflation rate as high as 4% this year, with the impending implementation of the goods and services tax. if earnings dont grow as much, glcs would then have to increase their payout ratios in response to the governments needs, said a head of research.  some of the glcs have big capital expenditure (capex) requirements but if the government asked them to pay more dividends, they will still have to oblige, he added, citing the case of petroliam nasional bhd. while the national oil firms management had expressed its reservations on raising dividends, the government has repeatedly reminded the former that it makes the ultimate decision on the level of dividends that the national oil firm has to pay. looking at the list of selected glcs (see table), most have retained earnings that are multifold of their 12-month trailing net profit. an analyst pointed out that s p setia bhd, in which permodalan nasional bhd (pnb) is the major shareholder, is capable of paying a bigger dividend, as there is no major land banking exercise in store in its financial year ending oct 31, 2015 (fy15). s p setia has no big plans so far, said the analyst. the property developer (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 1.2) has a dividend policy of distributing at least 50% of its net profit, with its dividend of 9.7 sen per share in fy14 accounting for about 60% of its earnings per share. with retained earnings that were four times its fy14 net profit of rm405.68 million and no major land acquisitions announced, the group looks to be able to distribute more dividends, some said. meanwhile, another of pnbs listed conglomerates, sime darby bhd (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.3), has retained earnings of rm28.9 billion, which is 8.59 times its trailing 12-month net profit of rm3.36 billion. in addition, its net gearing level is also low at 0.23 times. sime darby has a pending deal to acquire new britain palm oil ltd for some rm5.63 billion. but after this, analysts dont expect a major acquisition by the group, at least in the short term. nevertheless, weak palm oil prices and the slowdown in its china vehicle distribution business may dent sime darbys profitability and crimp its dividends, some said. alliancedbs research, in a note last friday, said companies owned by khazanah nasional bhd are more likely to be the ones asked to pay more dividends, compared with other glcs that are largely owned by trust funds managed by pnb or the employees provident fund. in 2013, khazanah contributed rm650 million in dividends to the government. this suggests that dividends from khazanah will need to be ramped up significantly in order to achieve the [additional] rm400 million target, said the research house in the note. alliancedbs believes the four glcs that could give out more dividends are axiata group bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 0.9), time dotcom bhd (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 0.6), petronas gas bhd (petgas) (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 0.9), and misc bhd (fundamental: 1.6; valuation: 1.8). axiata and time are majority owned by khazanah, while petgas and misc are majority owned by petronas. based on our analysis, axiata is likely to be the major contributor as it has the capacity to raise its payout ratio from 80% (our current estimate) to 100%, given its strong free cash flow from malaysian operations. if this happens, this will raise rm205 million in additional dividends for khazanah, alliancedbs explained. jf apexs lee, who tracks telecommunications stocks, said telcos will have to balance between dividend payout and allocation for their capex. telcos have high capex commitments because they have to build infrastructure. for telekom malaysia bhd (tm), should it get the governments go-ahead to start its second phase of high-speed broadband this year, its cash might be constrained by the huge capex, he said. like axiata, tm is majority owned by khazanah. telcos are seen as dividend-seekers favourites due to their stable earnings and generous payout ratios, although currently their yields are in the range of just 4%. khazanah owns 28.73% of tm (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 0.9) and 37.89% of axiata. in the past four financial quarters, tm paid out a dividend of 25.8 sen per share, which is nearly 97% of its earnings per share of 26.61 sen in the same period. currently, tm has a policy of paying out either rm700 million or a maximum of 90% of its net profit, whichever is higher. either way, tms dividend payout has a limit and is constrained by its performance. back to petronas-owned listed companies, while they might be facing earnings headwinds given the depressed crude oil prices, they are lowly geared. two of them, petgas and petronas chemicals group bhd (pchem), are in net cash positions. however, alliancedbs said that both petgas and pchem (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 1.2) might be constrained by capex requirements for the pengerang regasification terminal project and the refinery and petrochemical integrated development. while no glc has come out since to declare bumper dividends or bigger payouts, many of the blue-chips have seen their share prices move up. between last tuesday and friday, axiata rose 22 sen or 3.15% to rm7.21; sime darby gained 27 sen or 2.91% to rm9.56; petronas dagangan bhd jumped 86 sen or 5.27% to rm17.18; and petgas, meanwhile, rose 96 sen or 4.49% to rm22.36. tenaga nasional bhd (tnb), majority owned by khazanah, was also instrumental in lifting the benchmark index back to the 1,800 level last week. save for last tuesday, the utility giant was consistently in the top gainers rank and it closed the week 60 sen or 4.14% higher to record a fresh high of rm15.10. while tnb (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1) has reported a 34% jump in its net profit for the first quarter ended nov 30, 2014 and is expected to deliver record earnings due to lower coal cost and a tariff hike last year, analysts said it might be needing cash for its new power plants, hence potentially capping its dividend payout.  \nthe edge researchs fundamental score

industry is expected to see tougher competition but it will still record overall revenue growth this year, according to industry players and analysts. usually, industry revenue is closely correlated to gdp [gross domestic product] growth, but last year seems to be an anomaly ... i think that is going to be challenging [going forward] because each one of us has to show growth and it means that there will be higher competition in the market, u mobile sdn bhd chief executive officer (ceo) wong heang tuck told the edge financial daily. he also termed 2014 a challenging year for all telco providers, with the industry by and large posting relatively flat revenue. nevertheless, he said u mobile has shown good growth in 2014 and said customers can expect more innovative services and ideas from the group next year. the impact of the goods and services tax [gst] that will come in on april 1 remains to be seen. hopefully, the knee-jerk reaction wont last too long and that in terms of telco consumption, it will come back to normal, he said. as one of the smaller telco players in the country, u mobile wants to bring its services on par with the three industry giants  axiata group bhd (celcom brand), maxis bhd and digi.com bhd  with an aggressive rollout of 2,000 new 3g and 4g lte network sites by end-2015, costing a total of rm1.5 billion. u mobile also aims to improve its bottom line performance next year, having narrowed its losses by 18.27% to rm363.2 million for financial year 2014 ended dec 31, from a net loss of rm444.4 million a year before. wong also said once the company has completed its site rollout, it will look into expanding its coverage and services in sabah and sarawak, where it already has two service centres in kuching and kota kinabalu. relative newcomer altel communications sdn bhd foresees a significant impact on the companys performance from the gst, but is unsure if it will be positive or negative. we are gearing up to face all possibilities with regards to the upcoming implementation of the gst. we have engaged a consultant to put together the best possible plan for our business, said altel ceo nik abdul aziz nik yaacob in a recent interview. operating since july 2012, altel is a subsidiary of puncak semangat sdn bhd, which is controlled by tycoon tan sri syed mokhtar al-bukhary. the company has about 279,000 active subscribers and plans to launch postpaid services by the end of the first quarter of this year. digi.com ceo lars norling expects the industry to grow on positive momentum of data, but concurred that there would be increased competition and the continued tapering of revenue from voice and messaging (sms) services. more malaysians are gaining access to the internet every day. there is also a rising number of smartphone users spending more time online and owning multiple devices. these trends have proliferated demand for internet services and increased smartphone penetration in recent quarters, he said in an email. moving forward, norling said digi.com plans to reach out to more customers and drive consumption by making internet services a part of its core offering. we have placed significant emphasis on ensuring a wide range of smart device bundles are made easily available to all segments of customers, he said. the robust demand for internet services will fuel continued growth this year. we believe our stronger subscriber base ... will set a favourable trajectory and boost future service revenue, he said. publicinvest research analyst lee wee sieng opined that the telco industry had a good year in 2014, with digi.com the top performer. that is to be expected, since they are now reaping the benefits of their network modernisation exercise, which was completed in late 2013, he said. lee said u mobile had also performed well in 2014 due to the lower prices of its products and services, but raised the question of how long the company could sustain that strategy. more intense competition notwithstanding, lee does not see the possibility of a heightened price war erupting among telcos this year in their effort to expand the customer base. the big three have always been quite rational. i believe they wouldnt want to rock the boat, he said. as for 2015, lee said his stock pick is axiata, as two of the groups subsidiaries, xl axiata and celcom axiata, are expected to post better performances, having weighed on the overall group performance last year. as at sept 30, celcoms gross revenue had decreased 3.8% year-on-year (y-o-y) while profit after tax declined 14.6% to rm1.33 billion. xl meanwhile, posted a 2.2% decline y-o-y in gross revenue and a loss after tax of rm251.1 million. in march last year, xl acquired another indonesian telco provider, pt axis telekom indonesia, for us$865 million (rm3.08 billion), which is expected to help xl gain extra spectrum capacity, enhance its asset utilisation, and give it a larger subscriber base.  this

overweight sectors are power, construction, telecommunications, ports and glove sectors. maybank kim eng research executive director ong seng yeow said main themes in 2015 include infrastructure

seminar on saturday. he said hartalega (tp: rm8.50) could benefit from the strengthening greenback as the company is involved in exports, while its expanded capacity, coupled with the lower latex prices could improve its margins. maybank ib director and head of equities ck lim said stocks with higher yields will be another theme for 2015. that basically means utilities and telecommunications as well. what we like is the consistency in revenue, which brings about a stable set of results and obviously, in a tough market, investors dont really like surprises, he said. lim also noted that there has been a shift to dividend stocks from oil and gas stocks after the recent plunge in oil prices. the research house named tnb (tp: rm16), axiata (tp: rm7.80) and star publications (malaysia) bhd (rm2.65) as its stock picks based on yield. besides that, ong said mergers and acquisitions would be another talking point for the year, with stocks in focus including wct holdings bhd, which could see the listing of its retail assets in the fourth quarter of 2015, s p setia bhd on a potential property asset injection by permodalan nasional bhd, and ncb holdings bhd, also on a possible injection by mmc corp bhd. he added that sarawak stocks such as cahya mata sarawak bhd (cms) (tp: rm4.80) and hock seng lee bhd (hsl) (tp: rm2.15) are also closely monitored in view of the sarawak

working on a business trust route which should pave the way for further dividend enhancement. the goods and services tax (gst), which kicks off in april 2015, should also benefit digi the most among

second-largest economy, it said. m & a securities research head rosnani rasul said wall street ended marginally lower on tuesday as sentiment was hampered by global economic weakness, chinas decision

export deceleration was not enough, developments in chinas banking system had certainly pushed investors to the edge. in greece, presidential election had been brought forward by two months, the outcome of which could make or break the country's bailout plan. we, at this stage, do not discount entirely greece opting out of the eurozone despite the bailout plan as greece being out of the pact

week and this indicates that the selling pressure has eased and the market was being cautious and stayed on the sidelines. average daily trading volume in the past week was only 1.6 billion shares compared with 2.6 billion shares in the previous week. the average daily trading value declined from rm2.3 billion two weeks ago to rm1.9 billion. total market valuation fell rm14 billion from last week to rm1,735 billion. both local and foreign institutions were net sellers last week (last monday to last friday). local institutions net selling was rm51.0 million and foreign net selling was rm27.3 million. in the fbm klci, decliners marginally edged gainers 8 to 7. decliners in the index were led by petronas chemicals sdn bhd (-5.9% from last week), felda global ventures holdings bhd (-4.5%) and petronas dagangan bhd (-4.5%), and gainers were led by tenaga nasional bhd (+3.8%), kuala lumpur kepong bhd (+3.2%) and axiata group bhd (+2.4%) markets in asia pulled back in the past two days, wiping out some earlier gains, and performances were mixed on a week-to-week basis. chinas shanghai stock exchange composite declined 0.5% in a week to 2,457.53 points yesterday. japans nikkei 225 increased 1.3% in a week to 17,344.06 points, near its seven-year high. meanwhile, singapores straits times index increased only 0.7% in a week to 3,313.73 points. hong kongs hang seng index declined 1.2% to 23,529.17 points. markets in the united states struggled to record new highs and europe was mixed. on monday, the us dow jones industrial average increased only 0.2% in a week to 17,647.75 points. londons ftse100 index increased 0.9% in a week to 6,671.97 points but germanys dax declined 0.5% to 9,306.35 points. the us dollar index, that measures the us dollars against a basket of major currencies, rose marginally from 87.91 points a week ago to 88.01 points. uncertain economic growth spurs demand for precious metals. price of gold continued to increase after a rebound two weeks ago. commodity exchange gold rose 3% in a week to us$1,186.60 (rm3,981) an ounce. nymex wti crude oil fell 2.2% in a week to us$75.48 per barrel after rebounding from its lowest level in three years at us$73.25 last friday. crude palm oil futures on bursa malaysia continued to decline last week on weak demand, falling 0.5% in a week to rm2,251 per tonne. the ringgit was weaker against the us dollar at rm3.35 per dollar as compared with rm3.33 a week ago. technically, the trend has turned bearish. first, it failed to break and stay above the long-term 200-day moving average (ma) and downtrend line three weeks ago. now, the index declined below the short-term 30-day ma last week. however, the index rebounded from the support level we anticipated last week at 1,810 points, which is the 50% retracement level of the bullish trend that started in mid-october. the price rebounded yesterday after testing and breaking below the support level to close at 1,806.48 points on monday. the rebound yesterday indicates that there is support on the 50% retracement level. however, the momentum is bearish as the momentum oscillators like rsi and momentum oscillator fell below its mid-level. furthermore, the index has also fallen below the middle band of the bollinger bands indicator. the index has now retraced to the 50% fibonacci retracement level of the bullish trend that started in mid-october. the index has rebounded from this level but it has to increase further to boost market confidence. the rebound may be capped at the immediate resistance level at 1,830 points. however, we expect the index to decline to the psychological level at 1,800 points if the index failed to rebound.  \nbenny lee is chief market strategist for jupiter securities sdn bhd.

"}, "164": {"date_posted": "17/10/2014", "title": "a very red and wild october", "article": " american stock markets tumbled on wednesday after the large overnight drops in europe. a large greek equity sell-off and a cut to germanys growth forecasts stirred memories of the eurozones sovereign-debt crisis in 2011. a bigger-than-expected drop in us retail sales also ignited concern about the impact of the global slowdown on the american economy. the s&p 500 index plunged 15.21 points to close at 1,862.49 points whilst the dow tumbled 173.45 points to end at 16,141.74. the fbm klci index traded in a wider range of 41.18 points for the week with lower volumes of 1.81 billion to 2.58 billion shares traded. the index closed at 1,767.77 points on oct 16, down 19.07 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks such as axiata group bhd, cimb group holdings bhd, genting bhd, sapurakencana petroleum bhd and umw holdings bhd caused the index to fall on persistent selling activities. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements, since may 2013, have been trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69 (high), 1,802.88 (low), 1,896.23 (high), 1,837.28 (low) and 1,879.62 (high). all the indexs daily signals turned negative recently. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at 1,700, 1,727 and 1,759, while the resistance areas of 1,767 and 1,800 and 1,829 would offer heavy liquidation and selling activities. the klcis simple-moving averages (18, 40 and 20) depict an emerging downtrend for its daily and weekly charts. with the prices breaking below the larger and lower rising wedge support line on sept 15, 2014, we foresee longer-term selling activities for the index. the selling pressure would be intense and persistent if and when the index rebounds. downside targets for this move are at 1,730 (in the short term) and 1,682 (in the medium term). due to the softer tone for the klci index, we are recommending a chart sell on british american tobacco (m) bhd (bat). bat turned into downtrend since hitting its recent 52-week high of rm73.48 in august 2014. at maybank investment bank bhd, our fundamental analyst has an unchanged sell call on bat and target price of rm62. in a surprise move in early september 2014, bat announced an 8% to 9% price hike per cigarette box. this was its third price increase in just over a year, but bat reversed its decision after two weeks. despite the surprising u-turn to pre-sept 8 price hikes, our analysts forecast remains unchanged as he had expected higher operating costs and assumed a larger 12% year-on-year volume contraction will mitigate the higher revenue from the price hike. with the reversion of the price hike, our analyst currently assumes a 6% per annum contraction. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that 17 research houses have coverage on bat. of the 17, there are only two buy calls, seven hold calls and eight sell calls. this stock currently trades at expensive price-to-earnings ratio of 21.6 times while its price-to-book value ratio of 34.9 times indicates that its share price is trading at a premium to its book value. the reported shareholding changes on bloomberg revealed net selling by mostly foreign institution funds over the past month. bats chart trend on the daily time frame is very weak and is firmly down. its share price made a large plunge since its daily wave-5 and recent all-time high of rm73.48 in august 2014. since that rm73.48 high, bat plunged to its recent october 2014 low of rm65.14. as prices broke above their recent key critical support levels of rm71.50 and rm71.20, look to sell bat on any rebound to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to medium-term downtrends for this stock. the daily indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) have issued sell signals and now depict very firm indications of bats eventual move towards much lower levels. it would attract very weak buying interest at the support levels of rm63.05, rm65.14 and rm65.50. we expect bat to attract major liquidation towards its resistance levels of rm66.72, rm71.20 and rm71.50. its downside targets are located at rm62.75, rm61.90 and rm56.90.  \nlee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at

[the telecom site] has to get approval from the authorities before it can proceed, he said. the funding for the acquisition of the sites, among others, will come from the rm150 million sukuk proceeds ock raised last year, said ooi, adding that the proceeds could fund its capital expenditure requirements over a three- to four-year period. on a separate matter, ock said it is eyeing to expand its green technology business, and looking at acquiring more solar farms. however, the number would depend on the quota set by the government under the feed-in-tariff, said ooi. ock owns a solar farm in kelantan and had entered into engineering procurement construction with another three solar farms. commenting on the malaysian communications and multimedia commissions (mcmc) plan to expand telecommunication coverage in rural areas, ooi said he is still waiting for more information from mcmc which is expected by end of this month. responding to the speculations that ock is the frontrunner for a lions share of the projects to build more telecommunication towers in rural areas, ooi said it is still early to say as every bidder has an equal chance. mcmc is planning to build 1,000 telecommunication towers nationwide in stages to improve the broadband usage rate and the network coverage in underserved areas. the first phase involves 400 towers while the second phase involves 300. the rm1.5 billion project is expected to be completed three years after its commencement. ock closed unchanged at rm1.44 last friday, with a market capitalisation of rm499.1 million. the stock has gained 44% from around rm1.00 in mid-march. rhb research has a buy call on ock, with a target price of rm1.65, according to a poll by bloomberg. \nthis article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on september 15, 2014.

mentioned that the market was hanging in a balance between the bull and the bear, and in the past one week, the bull seemed to be stronger. the fbm klci mildly rebounded on strong bullish market performance in the us and rebounds in the regional markets. the klci increased only 0.3% in a week to 1,866.08 points on monday after trading in a range of between 1,853.31 and 1,867.40 points. the index could have closed higher if it was not dragged down by strong selling in petronas dagangan bhd (petdag). trading volume remained firm but relatively low compared to the previous months. this is an indication that the market is still being cautious. the average daily trading volume in the past one week was 1.7 billion shares. the average trading value was rm1.9 billion compared with rm1.7 billion two weeks ago, indicating the trading of higher priced stocks. foreign institutions continued to be net buyers throughout last week. the stronger ringgit may be the catalyst for foreign buying. net buying by foreign institutions was rm327.2 million while net selling by local institutions and retail investors stood at rm271.2 million and rm56.0 million respectively. in the klci, gainers beat decliners 19 to 8. gainers were led by ytl corp bhd (+2.5%), axiata group bhd (+2.2%) and hong leong bank bhd (+2.2%), while decliners were led by petdag (-10.6%), cimb group holdings bhd (-0.8%) and british american tobacco (malaysia) bhd (-0.8%). markets were directionless last week and this was a sign of cautiousness. singapores straits times index declined 0.6% in a week to 3,222.43 points on monday. hong kongs hang seng index rose 1.3% in a week to 22,261.61 points and chinas shanghai stock exchange composite index also increased 1.3% in a week to 2,052.87 points. the us dow jones industrial average increased 1% in a week to 16,695.47 points. however, londons ftse100 index increased only 0.4% to 6,851.75 points while germanys dax increased 1.8% in a week to 9,702.46 points. the us dollar index rebounded strongly last week after the us federal reserve committed to continuing to keep interest rates low until the economic growth becomes steady. the us dollar index increased from 79.13 points a week ago to 79.96 points. commodity exchange gold declined only 1.1% in a week to us$1,295.50 (rm4,197.42) an ounce. the new york mercantile exchange wti crude rose 1.2% in a week to us$100.62 per barrel. the ringgit strengthened against the us dollar from 3.26 in the previous week to 3.23. crude palm oil rebounded mildly, rising only 0.2% in a week to rm2,589 per tonne. the klci continued to trade within the support and resistance levels of the triangle chart pattern. the trend was bullish as the index stayed above the short-term 30-day moving average and above the ichimoku cloud. the short-term or immediate support level remained at 1,845 points and the immediate resistance level is at 1,870 points. the bullish trend should be able to continue if the index is able to break above the immediate resistance level. the momentum of the bullish trend is steady as momentum indicators like the rsi, macd and momentum oscillator are above their mid-levels. therefore, there is a high chance for the klci to test the resistance level at 1,870 points, thus continuing its uptrend. furthermore, the bollinger bands are steadily expanding upwards and the index is trading above the middle band. if the index is able to break above the immediate resistance level of 1,870 points, it confirms the triangle pattern which has a short-term target at 1,900 points. i am expecting the market to be bullish this week as the technical indicators on the klci are being supported well. the index is expected to test this immediate resistance level this week and climb higher in the short term towards 1,900 points, unless there are any reversal indications. if the klci fails to break above 1,870 points, then expect it to further consolidate

p1", "article": " speculation over the sale of packet one networks (m) sdn bhd (p1), which has been swirling for some time, finally came to an end last week, with telekom malaysia bhd emerging as the new strategic partner for the wimax operator. investor reaction was, however, tepid. shares for green packet bhd closed down 9.6% at 47 sen last friday.  recall that its share price surged as high as 64 sen in october on speculation of an imminent sale of its 55% stake in p1. meanwhile, the share price for telekom closed down 4.3% at rm5.93. the lukewarm reaction is understandable. telekom will inject cash into p1 and recharge its expansion plans, which have slowed significantly over the past year. but that in itself is no guarantee of success in the very competitive telco sector. no cashing out for green packet shareholders of green packet are likely disappointed that the much talked about sale values p1 at less than when a 25.8% stake was sold to sk telecom for us$100 million (rm327 million) back in 2010. telekom is now paying only rm350 million for a 57% equity stake in the wimax operator.  more importantly, telekoms 57% stake comes from the issuance of new shares by p1. this means that green packet does not get a share of the rm350 million proceeds but its stake will be diluted to 30% based on the enlarged share capital of p1.  having said that, green packet will get some cash flow  from the issuance of rm210 million worth of redeemable exchangeable bonds to telekom. the first tranche for rm120 million should be issued later this year with the balance likely in 2015.  save for some rm30 million that will be used to acquire p1 shares held by minority shareholders, the remaining proceeds can be utilised by green packet for settlement of liabilities and working capital. (telekom can swap the bonds for green packets shares in p1 in five years time, if they are not redeemed.)  but given that green packet will also subscribe for 15% of the rm1.65 billion redeemable convertible bonds to be issued by p1  equivalent to roughly rm248 million  over the next three years, it is unlikely there will be any special payout to shareholders from this whole exercise. this means that green packet shareholders will have to continue to be patient. instead of cashing out, shareholders will have to wait for p1s turnaround. in the meantime, the company will likely remain in the red with limited chance for dividends. we have previously mentioned that green packet may well want to retain a stake in p1 (article published oct 16, 2013). the broadband business is its primary thrust going forward unless the company decides on a major strategic change. its other businesses, the devices unit is very competitive and marginally loss-making while margins for the communications unit are wafer thin with limited prospects. but it is sorely in need of a game changer if it is to turn the company around. getting telekom onboard is potentially that game changer. cash infusion to recharge p1s expansion plans one of p1s greatest obstacles was the limits of its balance sheet. unlike deep-pocketed ytl communications, which could afford a nationwide rollout, p1 has always been very cautious in expanding, adding sites and capacity only in lock-step with demand. we estimate total capital expenditure (capex) spent to date, since 2007, at just about rm1 billion. this rollout model works quite well for the home broadband business. gradually expanding coverage in the later years allowed p1 to launch limited nomadic broadband services but its roughly 55%-60% coverage is too low to offer nationwide mobile broadband services.  to compete fully in the 4g mobile services market, p1 would need nationwide coverage  at least 80% to compete with the likes of maxis bhd, celcom axiata bhd and digi.com bhd. that means substantially more capex, which would be difficult without corresponding improvement in revenue and cash flow. p1 generated rm306 million revenue in 2013 with operating earnings (before depreciation, interest and tax) of just rm38 million and net loss of rm116 million. with telekom in the picture, p1 is slated to raise rm2 billion in fresh capital  rm1.65 billion in convertible bonds and rm350 million from new shares issued to telekom  to fund its lte network rollout for the next three years. telekom and sk telecom will subscribe to 60% and 25% of the bonds while green packet will take up the remaining 15%.  even so, there is no guarantee of p1s turnaround. the lte-space is extremely competitive and dominated by maxis, celcom and digi while smaller players like u mobile and ytl communications also jostle for a share of the already saturated market. and then, there is newcomer altel communications, which is owned by tycoon tan sri syed mokhtar al-bukhary. p1 a risky bet for telekom as such, the investment could be a risky one for telekom. the company has been doing well, focusing on the home broadband market segment that is driven by good take up for its unifi services. with this proposed acquisition, gearing will rise and earnings in the near to medium term will be hurt by higher interest expenses and consolidation of p1s losses  probably by between 10%-20% from current earnings estimates.  at the prevailing price, the stock is trading at roughly 22 times our estimated earnings for the current year with net yield of 4.4%. with flattish to slightly negative earnings growth likely for the next year or two, at least, telekoms valuations do not appear attractive. whether the acquisition turns out to be value accretive depends

higher yesterday, reversing earlier losses as global market sentiment remained mixed after weighing between an improving global outlook and on concern that tension in ukraine may escalate. american markets fell on wednesday night, led down by a softer technology sector (via weakness in king digital entertainments initial public offering and facebook). the sp 500 index fell 13.06 points to close at 1,852.56 points while the dow tumbled 98.89 points to end at 16,268.99 on wednesday night. the fbm klci traded in a firmer range of 25.84 points for the week with higher volumes of 1.94 billion to 2.08 billion shares done. the index closed at 1,846.87 yesterday, up 7.73 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like axiata group bhd, ioi properties group bhd, petronas dagangan bhd, rhb capital bhd and umw holdings bhd caused the index to move up on late local first quarter of 2014 (1q14) window dressing activities yesterday. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the price movements in the index in the next few months following may 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69 (high) and 1,802.88 (low). the indexs daily signals (like cci, dmi, macd, stochastic and oscillator) are all positive. as such, its firm support levels are seen at 1,802, 1,820 and 1,846, while the resistance areas of 1,849, 1,852 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some very heavy selling. our rebound retracement target of 1,839.26 (62% level) had capped the index on march 6. however, the 1q14 window dressing activities late this month have caused the index to break above that key level. thus, we may visit upside targets of 1,871 and 1,882 in the medium term yet again. its simple moving averages (ma) depict an emerging uptrend for its daily, weekly and monthly charts. due to its firmer chart signals, we believe investors will continue to adopt a buy on dips philosophy for the klci. due to the firmer tone for the klci, we are recommending a chart buy on inari amertron bhd, which broke above the rm1 billion market capitalisation mark on march 7 after our weekly write-up in october 2013 when the market capitalisation was just about rm560 million. the strong rise in the stock can be attributed to investor optimism on its future earnings potential as well as the potential transfer to the main market of bursa malaysia. for 2q ended dec 31 of financial year 2014 (2qfy14), inaris profit before tax (pbt) improved significantly to rm26.6 million from rm11.3 million in 2qfy13. the improved profitability was attributed to the increase in revenue, strong us dollar and favourable gold prices during the period as well as consolidation of revenue and profit generated by the newly acquired amertron group. going forward, inari expects rising demand to contribute positively to its outlook, as demand for smartphones and tablet computers is expected to grow further in the near term. a check on bloomberg consensus reveals that only one research house has coverage on the stock, with a buy call. the stock is currently trading at a fair historical price-earnings ratio of 14.8 times but a high price-to-book value of 5.9 times. inari has a fair indicative 12-month dividend yield of 2.29%. inaris chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames are very strong. its share price made an obvious surge since its weekly wave-2 low of 37 sen in march 2013. since that 37 sen low, inari surged to its recent march 2014 high of rm2.87. its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to its recent march 2014 high of rm2.87. as it broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of rm2.31 and rm2.54, look to buy inari on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to medium term uptrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) are very positive and now depict the obvious indications of inaris eventual move towards much higher levels. we expect inari to remain very well sought after on dips towards its support levels of rm2.31, rm2.54 and rm2.78. it may attract minor profit taking at the resistance levels of rm2.85 and rm2.87. its upside targets are now located at rm3.31, rm3.69, rm3.82 and rm4.51. this article first

malaysia will see the listing of its fifth exchange-traded fund (etf), myetf msci malaysia islamic dividend (myetf-mmid), by i-vcap management sdn bhd. myetf-mmid is designed for investors looking to invest in a liquid financial instrument, with an index-tracking feature that focuses on high-dividend-yield, shariah-compliant companies listed on bursa malaysia, says its prospectus. put another way, the fund, which has an approved size of 500 million units, issued at rm1 each, is suitable for investors looking for a passive approach to investing in a basket of shariah-compliant equities. unfamiliar to many, an etf is an open-ended investment or unit trust fund, that is traded on a stock exchange. it essentially combines the features of an index fund and a stock, where trading liquidity is reflective of its underlying basket of stocks, bonds or commodities. to determine its exposure, investors will need to examine the underlying benchmark and the assets held by the etf.  myetf-mmid is a passively managed fund, which means, the manager aims to track the performance of the benchmark index  the msci malaysia imi islamic high dividend yield 10/40 index  rather than seeking to outperform it, which is done by an actively-managed fund that charges higher fees. the islamic etf will be managed by i-vcap management, a wholly-owned subsidiary of valuecap sdn bhd. i-vcap also manages myetf-djim25, which was listed in early 2008, and reportedly plans to list at least two more etfs this year.  for this etf, the manager aims to achieve an absolute value of tracking error, of less than 3%, between the nav (net asset value) of the fund and the benchmark index, the prospectus says. the benchmark index is designed as a performance benchmark for the high-dividend-yield segment of its parent index, msci malaysia imi islamic index, and may consist of 16 to 30 shariah-compliant companies listed on bursa malaysia, with higher-than-average dividend yields, that are deemed both sustainable and persistent, by the msci. as at the last practicable date, the top 10 constituents of the benchmark index, which are reviewed and rebalanced semi-annually, with changes implemented at the close of the last business day in may and november, included digi.com bhd, axiata group bhd, maxis bhd, kuala lumpur kepong bhd, hap seng plantations holdings, ta ann holdings bhd, telekom malaysia bhd, umw holdings bhd, wct holdings bhd and mah sing group bhd.  as a general rule, the fund invests at least 90% of its assets in authorised securities, and keeps not more than 10% of its assets in liquid assets, or cash and cash equivalents.  the fund is not allowed to invest in derivatives, or to borrow cash. it may distribute to the unitholders, all or a substantial portion of its distributable income, prorated according to the number of units held by each unit holder, as at the entitlement date of the income distribution.  the ability of the fund to make distributions, depends principally on the dividends declared and paid by the companies, whose securities are held by the fund, and the level of fees and expenses payable by the fund. the manager has absolute discretion over the exact amount to be distributed, and income distribution, if any, is expected to be made annually. the annual management fee is set at 0.4% of the funds nav per annum, while the annual trustee fee is 0.045% of nav per annum, subject to a minimum of rm12,000. investors should be aware that, by investing in the fund, there is no guarantee of any income distribution or returns. there is also no guarantee that investors will enjoy any capital appreciation, or will not experience any loss of capital invested in the fund, the prospectus reads.  it adds: factors such as the fees and expenses incurred by the fund, imperfect correlation between the fund assets and the index securities, rounding of share prices, changes to the benchmark index and regulatory policies, may affect the managers ability to achieve close correlation with the performance of the benchmark index. investors who do not hold redemption unit blocks, currently set at 400,000, will only be able to realise the value of their units, by selling them on bursa malaysia at market price, which may deviate from the funds nav. this story first appeared in the edge weekly edition of march 17-23,

posted results that came in within expectations, except for two outperformers, telekom malaysia bhd and digi.com bhd. tms performance was mainly due to a tax incentive while digi was fuelled by stronger uptake of its mobile internet service and better cost efficiencies. axiata group bhds short-term outlook remains challenging due to the integration costs of its indonesian subsidiary, pt xl axiata tbks acquisition of pt axis telekom indonesia, and continued currency fluctuations in all its key regional operations. maxis bhd, on the other hand, continued to be lacklustre, as expected, due to its ongoing business transformation plan. the telco sectors price-earnings ratio (per) has a strong correlation with dividend payout rather than the risk-free rate. based on our consensus dividend payout and yield spread studies, the sectors per has a stronger correlation of 93% with the dividend payout in contrast to -58% correlation with the malaysian government securities (mgs) 10-year yield. our findings also showed that the sectors per is likely to be narrowed in financial year 2014 (fy14). maxis fy14 per is expected to be narrow while both telekom and axiatas per are likely to widen. digis per direction in fy14 is seen to be mixed. as at end-fy13, the smartphone penetration rates for maxis, celcom axiata bhd and digi stood at 56%, 38% and 38.1% respectively, which suggest room for growth in the future. competition in the fibre-to-the-home (ftth) segment will likely ease following the review of its home segment by maxis. we are maintaining our neutral call on the telecommunications sector. while the data segment remained the key focus for all the celcos, they are also likely focus on spurring smartphone penetration rate through entry-level smartphones as well as widening network coverage in fy14. our 1qfy14 stock pick, tm, has advanced by 10.1% year-to-date (as at march 25, 2014), outperforming the sector (-0.1%) and klci (-1.0%) for the same period. in view of tms current share price which is trading above our target price, we have downgraded the stock to market perform from outperform. despite the lower rating, tm (target price [tp]: rm6) remains our top pick for the sector due to: (i) its solid presence in the ftth market; (ii) the milder competition in its wholesale and fixed-line segments; and (iii) it potentially bagging the second phase of the high speed broadband (hsbb) project, which could lead the company to use the prospective savings in capital expenditure (or government grant) to reward its shareholders. if we are to assume that tm bags the project, we estimate that the government grant could come in at 20% to 25% (or rm360 million to rm450 million, representing 10 sen to 12.6 sen per share), which is similar to the quantum the company received for phase 1 of the hsbb project. digis stock rating has also been lowered to market perform after it advanced by 8.1% ytd and is now trading slightly above our tp of rm5.24. there is no change to our market perform call on both maxis (tp: rm7.10) and axiata (tp: rm6.57).  kenanga research, march 26 this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on march

effective tax rate was at only 17%, vis-u00e0-vis our projected corporate rate of 25%. hence, we deem the result to be within expectations. for 9mfy13, property development contributed significantly to the earnings improvement, as the divisions revenue and estimated ebit surged 43% and 33% respectively, with high billings from developments in sunway south quay, sunway velocity and sunway nexis. as at sept 30, 2013, unbilled sales stood at rm2.2 billion, compared with rm2.41 billion a year earlier. launches as at november 2013, totalled rm1.7 billion. construction also boosted the groups

that will allow the company to pass on the fluctuations in fuel costs, to the end-consumer. we lift our core earnings forecasts for fy14 and fy15 marginally higher, by 1.5% and 3.2% respectively.

research (dec 3): berjaya sports toto announced that it has aborted its proposed listing of stm-trust on the singapore exchange, due to the current challenging market conditions and the poor performance of listed yield stocks, such as reits and other business trusts in singapore. we have always been apprehensive of the proposal, deeming the risk of capital loss to investors holding stm-trust units being higher than the gains from the special dividend, and 8% yield promised from the listing of stm-trust. most business trusts in singapore have performed poorly post-listing, with average returns of -29% from ipo prices, despite relatively high yields. with the cancellation, it is back to square one for btoto. therefore, we revert our valuation method to the dividend discount model, and adjust our target price from rm4.42 to rm4.54. we also upgrade our call to outperform. btotos share price has declined 10% since the beginning of 2013, and with the overhang of the proposed listing removed, we believe the stock will rebound, supported by its strong dividend yield.  supermax corp bhd target price: rm3.50buy ta securities research (dec 4): glove citys development will run concurrently with the proposed supermax business park. in november 2013, the group acquired 100 acres of industrial land in serendah, for rm78.4 million.  an integrated glove-manufacturing complex will be built on 60% of the land. the complex, to be developed in two phases over nine years, will have a capacity of 15.5 billion pieces per annum. management does not expect any shortage of natural rubber and nitrile butadiene rubber, in the foreseeable future. in view of the hike in electricity rates in 2014, management anticipates higher cost of rm3.5 million in fy14, which translate into 2.5% of earnings. we impute the new fy13, fy14 and fy15 total installed capacity of 17.8 billion, 23.1 billion and 29.9 billion pieces per annum, respectively. hence, we raise our fy15 earnings estimate by 6.2%, to rm189.2 million. we continue to like the stock for its undemanding valuation, versus its peers. inari amertron bhdtarget price: rm2.18buy affin investment research (dec 4): our fy14-fy16 eps

continue, supported by a planned 50% capacity expansion to cater for the roll-out of its test and measurement equipment, which are outsourced by agilent, and an increase in the output of its bread-and-butter radio frequency (rf) products for avago. we believe that the strong growth underpinning inari techs rf division, is the rising rate of long-term evolution (lte) adoption, which is a natural progression of 3g. according to independent reports, global lte subscription will hit two billion within the next five years, sealing inaris prospects in this fast-growth, high-demand area. we

4): glomacs 1hfy14 core net profit came in within expectations, accounting for 48% of our full-year estimates. sales during the period stood at rm265 million, a contraction of 31% from the previous year. the absence of new launches was the cause of the decline. the groups unbilled sales remained stable at rm858 million, as at october 2013, versus rm852 million a quarter ago.  following the announcement of cooling measures under budget 2014, management expects some short-term consolidation in the market, as consumers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. therefore, glomac has decided to re-strategise its fy14 launches, to focus on landed residential products, which are least impacted, and hold back the launch of commercial properties. hence, fy14 launch estimates have been revised downwards to rm1 billion, from rm1.3 billion previously. we tweak our discounted cash flow-base revised net asset value per share estimate, to rm1.26 per share, from rm1.45 previously. given an upside potential of 14.5%, we downgrade glomac to hold from buy.matrix concepts holdings bhdtarget price: rm4.80outperform kenanga research (dec 3): outperform recommendation and target price of rm4.80, based on a 20% discount on its revised net asset value of rm6 per share. we like the stock on account of developments in seremban, negeri sembilan, and kluang, johor, which enjoy growing demand. it is also reaping higher margins, because of low land costs.  after netting off dividends and expected acquisitions, the group has an estimated rm110 million for land purchases. assuming that land cost is 10% to 15% of gross development value (gdv) and a net gearing limit of 0.3 times, the group can replenish up to rm800 million to rm1.1 billion worth of gdv, from fy14e onwards. for fy13, we believe that the total dividend payout will be 60% (due to the exceptional dividends arising from fy12), which implies a net yield of 9.4%. we expect fy14e dividend payout of 45%, which implies a yield of 7.8%. valuations are also attractive, since matrix is trading at 6.6 times and 5.8 times fy13e and fy14e pers, respectively. bumi armada bhdtarget price: rm4.40buy maybank ib research (dec 4): bumi armada continues to benefit from lukoil. it has secured long-term charters for three new offshore support vessels (osvs) worth us$500 million (rm1.59 billion), commencing 2014. this is positive for earnings and complements its presence in filanovsky, russia.  meanwhile, the letter of award for the kraken floating production, storage and offloading vessel, is slightly delayed, but should be made known in a fortnight.  these osv contracts are for 10 years (us$262 million), with the option to extend for another 10 years (us$221 million). the vessels are scheduled to begin work in november 2015. pending delivery of these vessels, bumi armada has secured an interim contract worth us$18 million, to provide two support vessels and one rescue vessel for one year of work, commencing november 2014. we estimate that these ice-class osvs will generate a revenue of us$26.2 million, and an ebit of us$5.2 billion to us$6.6 million (20% to 25% margin) annually.  perdana petroleum bhdtarget price: rm1.70outperform kenanga research (dec 4): perdanas bonus share issue went ex on dec 3, 2013, increasing its share base by 40% to 727.2 million. perdana had announced in august 2013, a 2-for-5 bonus issue. we are positive about the bonus issue, as it will enhance trading liquidity of the stock. medium-to-long-term prospects are stable, on the back of perdanas long-term contracts. for its existing vessels, at least 10 are chartered until 2018-2019, and three are until 2014-2015. only four vessels  one accommodation barge and three anchor handling tug supply vessels  are on spot charters, which perdana is confident of securing recurring contracts. the enlarged share base reduces our target price to rm1.70 (versus rm2.50), based on an unchanged target price earnings of 14 times (in line with its two-year historical average forward earnings ratio of 14 times, seen in 2007-2008), on its cy14 earnings per share of 14.6 sen. as there is still a 19% upside, we are keeping our target outperform call on the stock.axiata group bhdtarget price: rm7.20hold maybank ib research (dec 3): indonesias ministry of communication and informatics has approved xls proposed acquisition of axis.  axiatas indonesian subsidiary xl will be allowed to keep axis entire 1,800mhz spectrum (15mhz), hence achieving its aim of the acquisition. nevertheless, we expect a relatively muted impact on axiatas share price, given the diminished significance of xls share price in recent times. recall the rationale of the deal was purely for spectrum, and a key risk was the ministry ordering the partial or full return of spectrum. xl will be required to return axis entire 2,100mhz spectrum (10mhz).  xl was initially expecting to retain 5mhz in this band. nevertheless, xl is already well-endowed in this band and in our view, management is unlikely to lose sleep, over this. after completion of the deal, the merged entity will have 45mhz of spectrum.at present, axis is loss-making (at the ebitda level) and hence, the merger will be earnings dilutive to xl, in the near term.  kossan rubber industries bhdtarget price: rm4.29buy alliance research (dec 3): kossan announced that it is acquiring 9.26 acres of freehold industrial land in mukim kapar, for rm19.37 million. we are positive about this move over the long term, as it is in line with the groups strategy to replenish its landbank, to cater for capacity expansion.  we understand that the land is strategically located near to its factories in klang, and is well-connected with the infrastructure for glove manufacturing, including natural gas supply.  we believe that this site will only be developed in 2015, with a target production capacity of six billion pieces of gloves per annum. this translates into a 30% additional capacity, from the estimated production capacity of 20 billion pieces per annum as at end-2014.  kossans balance sheet remained healthy, with a net gearing of just 12.6% as at september 2013. we reiterate our strong buy call on kossan, with an unchanged target price of rm4.29, based on 16 times fy14 p/e. this implies 16.5% capital upside, with a fy14 net dividend yield of 4.1%.  this story first appeared in the edge

as japanese shares slid from a 5u00bd year high. regional bond risks rose as chinas inflation eased and producer prices extended declines, adding to the signs that the economy is weakening. the us dollar climbed before the jobs data was due last night.  expectation that the initial jobless claims would fall caused the american markets to ease off on wednesday night. the sp500 lost 0.27 points to close at 1,837.61 points whilst the dow fell 68.2 points to end at 16,462.74. the fbm klci traded in a sideways range of 15.4 points for the week with volumes of 1.6 billion to 1.96 billion shares done. the index closed at 1,828.21 yesterday, down 3.09 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like ioi corp bhd, sime darby bhd, axiata group bhd, cimb bank bhd and tenaga nasional bhd caused the index to decline on profit taking activities yesterday. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the index price movements in the next few months following may 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low) and 1,882.2 (high). the indexs daily signals are mixed. the cci and macd are negative while the dmi, oscillator and stochastic are positive. as such, the indexs obvious support levels are seen at the 1,780, 1,800 and 1,822 levels, whilst the resistance areas of 1,828, 1,849 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some heavy profit-taking activities. our upside targets of 1,898, 1,900 and 1,924 for the index in the medium term may be deferred for now. its simple moving averages (ma) depict a double time frame (weekly and monthly) uptrend for now. its daily chart has turned into a neutral position in january 2014. due to its mixed signals, we believe investors may adopt a range trading philosophy as the klci remains at fairly lofty levels with bearish divergent signals. as such, profit-taking on index components as well as small to mid caps may persist into the next fortnight. despite the lofty tone of the klci, we are recommending a chart buy on mkh bhd, which is a rm1.1 billion market cap company with a return on equity of 12% based on its 12-month trailing earnings. the stock made a new recent high of rm3.27 in tandem with the improving sentiment of the small and mid cap property stocks. it seems that the recent recurring theme from the property segment is the asset revaluation approach, where investors favour property companies with strategic landbank with development potential.  the firm rise in the stock price can be attributed to investors optimism on its strong earnings trend led by the plantation and property and construction division. for the fourth quarter of financial year 2013 ended sept 30, mkhs group revenue rose 21%. the rise was attributed to its plantation divisions higher sales of crude palm oil and palm kernel, as well as the property and construction divisions revenue from ongoing and new developments. despite the better profitability, profit before tax was lower due to an inclusion of foreign exchange losses in the current quarter totalling rm63 million due to a weakening rupiah and ringgit against the us dollar. maybank-ib does not have fundamental coverage on mkh. a check on bloomberg consensus revealed that three brokers have coverage on the stock, with all having a buy call on the stock.  the stock is currently trading at a reasonable historical price-earnings ratio of 10 times and a price-to-book value of 1.2 times. mkhs indicated dividend yield is at 3.14%. its chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly timeframes are very strong indeed. its share price made an obvious surge since its monthly wave-2 low of 57 sen in october 2008. since that 57 sen low, mkh surged to its recent january 2014 high of rm3.27.  its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to the recent high of rm3.27. as it broke above its recent key critical resistances of rm2.62 and rm2.85, look to buy mkh on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to long term uptrends for this stock.  the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) are very strong and now depict the obvious indications of mkhs eventual surge to higher levels. we expect mkh to remain very firm towards its support levels of rm2.62, rm2.85 and rm3.10.  it will attract minor profit taking at the resistance levels of rm3.27, rm3.58 and rm4.13. its upside targets are now located at rm3.45, rm3.76, rm4.09 and rm4.22. this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on
