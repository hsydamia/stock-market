september 2014 before the meltdown of crude oil prices and the sharp depreciation of the ringgit. the renewed buying interest in big-cap stocks, thanks to the return of foreign funds to the local market, has lent support to the benchmark index. there is a diverging trend between the fbm klci and the fbm small cap index since the start of the year. analysts and fund managers attributed the uptrend to the fbm klci as a reflection of an improved macro picture of the country amid the recovery of the crude oil prices and the strengthening of the ringgit. the ringgit was at 3.8815 against the us dollar yesterday compared with 3.371 last friday. loui low, hong leong investment bank head of retail research, said that the buying interest and volume show the confidence level of foreign investors in malaysia. the foreign fund flow into malaysia has been strong year to date (ytd), and its likely that the strong performance today (yesterday) was driven by the banking sectors. foreign funds have been taking the rate hike in malaysia very positively, jf apex securities head of research lee chung cheng told the edge financial daily, pointing that the banks are expected to see marginal improvement in its net interest margin (nim) following the hike. bank negara malaysia raised the overnight policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.25% last thursday. lee noted that the small-cap stocks are not in favour now as foreign funds are unlikely to cast eyes on them. according to midf research, the foreign fund flow into the equity market was about rm3.26 billion so far this year (as of jan 26), while the local institutions have had been net sellers with about rm3.33 billion during the same period. lee believes that the benchmark index could see further upside in the near future as the fbm klci continues to play catch-up compared with its regional peers. the fbm klci has gained by 4.1% ytd but it still lagged behind its regional peers, such as the philippine stock exchange index that has gained 5.84%, singapores straits times index (5.13%), jakarta composite index (5.11%) and stock exchange of thailand index (4.75%). rakuten trades vice-president of research vincent lau agreed that the rate hike had put the spotlight on the banking sectors. if you look at the market, youll see that the [fbm] klci has outperformed the small-cap players. i think that its mainly because the foreign fund usually focuses on the big-cap companies. lets not forget that the small-cap counters have also performed relatively well in the last three to four years, lau said. ytd, some of the component stocks of the fbm klci that have performed very well include sime darby bhd, ytl corp bhd, rhb bank bhd, hong leong bank bhd, nestle (m) bhd, cimb group holdings bhd, ammb holdings bhd, press metal aluminium holdings bhd, public bank bhd and petronas gas bhd. across the board, decliners outnumbered gainers by 623 to 370 counters with the remaining 396 traded unchanged yesterday despite an increase of about 0.9% for the klci benchmark.  small cap to follow suit? the recent correction seen in the small- and mid-cap space represents a buying opportunity for investors, according to lau. the small-cap counters will pick up eventually as a stronger macroeconomic outlook presents a better growth opportunity for smaller companies, he said, pointing out that the current valuation of the small- and mid-cap space appears to be fair. lau expects to see continued earnings growth in the upcoming results season next month which he believes would be the catalyst for the market to go higher. the current economic environment is pointing to a better earnings season. the ringgit is on a firmer note given a much more stable oil price. export numbers continued to perform last year even though the ringgit has made a comeback. that shows the resilience of our exporters, he said. a head of research with an investment bank, who wants to remain anonymous, thinks that the rotational play on the big caps from small caps is normal especially given the outperformance of the small caps in the last few years. if you look at some of the valuations of the small-cap companies, they have run up. so, its normal to see such rotational play on bigger-cap companies especially with foreign funds coming in. of course, were still positive on the small-cap companies, simply because we think that there is still growth. it will be more selective but if these companies deliver earnings in the upcoming results season, we think that the rally in small-cap companies could continue, he said."}, "2":

record high level of rm15.98, could see some challenges moving forward to sustain its earnings growth against the backdrop of possible weaker trends in electricity demand, as well as lower contribution from associates. some analysts have downgraded the utility stock, although it remains as one of the cheapest blue chips on bursa malaysia in terms of valuation, after they have combed through the latest set of quarterly result released on friday (jan 26). among the research houses that have downgraded the utility group from a buy recommendation to hold are cimb equity research and midf research. nonetheless, there are some, such as hong leong investment bank and ambank, which reiterate their buy call on tenaga, partly due to its rather attractive yield of above 4%. cimb equity research has downgraded tenaga from add to hold on earnings risks, despite tenaga being viewed as one of the cheapest big-cap stocks on the local bourse. cimb research opines the stable regulated earnings might not be able to offset the earnings downside from potential lower electricity demand and weaker associate contributions. the downgrade came after announcement of its earnings figures for the financial quarter ended nov 30, 2017, which cimb said as came in within expectations. its core net profit for the fifteen months ended nov 30, 2017 (15mfy17) is about 93% of cimbs estimate for the sixteen months ending dec 31, 2017 (16mfy17) after excluding foreign exchange (forex) and rm150 million accrued interest from its ppa (power purchase agreement savings fund). note tenaga has changed its financial year end from aug 31 to dec 31 in 2017. hence, there will be 16 months for the financial year ended dec 31, 2017 (fy17). ngo siew teng, an analyst with cimb equity, shared the associates are expected to make losses in the near term, before starting to contribute positively in 2020. among these associates are gmr energy (30% owned) in india, vortex solar (50% owned) in uk and gama enerji (30% owned) in turkey. meanwhile, hong leong investment bank (hlib) research however maintain its overweight stance on tenaga, as hlib expects the utility company to have steady earnings and cash flow, with implementation of the incentive-based regulation/fuel cost pass through (ibr/fcpt) mechanism. the lowered 7.3% of regulated assets under regulatory period (rp) 2 (2018-2020) will be offset by higher asset base, new contributors from associates and power plants, daniel wong, an analyst with hlib research, said. however, wong said tenagas core earnings for the financial three-month period ended nov 30, 2017 of rm1.9 billion only make up of 66.8% of hlibs four months period ending dec 31, 2017 (4mfy17)s estimate, which is below expectation. tenaga is expected to announce its full year financial results for fy17 soon, with contribution from the month of december. while ngo has downgraded the target price (tp) for tenaga to rm16.70, wong has maintain its tp at rm17.50, based on discounted cash flow to equity valuation. meanwhile, ambank, which has reiterated its buy call, comments an implied dividend yield of between 4.8% and 5.3% (based on dividend payout ratio of 49.9%)

[the impact of] brent, at us$70 (rm275.10) per barrel today, is the same as us$85 per barrel before, because their (o&g firms) cost has come down for about us$15. i think the rally will continue. im

5%-6%. on tuesday, the edge financial daily reported that ambank group launched the mss on monday and that in an email to staff, it said eligible, confirmed employees of ambank, aminvestment bank and ambank islamic could apply for it over a two-week period until jan 19, 2018. it is understood that the mss does not extend to ambank groups insurance divisions 1,500 employees. as such, the mss will apply to about 9,500 staff, for which the take-up rate is estimated to be about 1,200, which is about 14% of the staff count (excluding insurance), maybank ib research said. ambank group is the sixth of malaysias eight local banking groups to launch a job rationalisation scheme in recent years. cimb group holdings bhd, rhb bank bhd, hong leong bank bhd, alliance bank bhd and affin holdings bhds investment banking arm had offered schemes in the past two to three years. in a more recent exercise, affin late last year shed just over 300 staff under a voluntary separation scheme. the banks have resorted to job rationalisation as they are more concerned than ever about becoming cost-efficient amid an increasingly challenging banking landscape that makes growing profits tougher. in ambank groups case, the groups cost-to-income ratio (cir)  at 57.2% as at the first half of fy18 (1hfy18)  is among the highest in the industry. with the mss, the group is unlikely to meet its target of bringing down cir to at least 55% in fy18. however, the exercise will help it improve cir over the longer term, analysts said. the announcement of the mss is not a surprise, given the groups rising cost structure where its cir rose from the recent low of 45% in fy14 to 57% in 1hfy18 versus peers average of 48%, uob kay hian research said in a report yesterday. the rising cost structure was largely due to new hires to ramp up the groups business banking franchise, it added. ambank groups net profit in 1hfy18 fell 2.35% year-on-year to rm659.74 million, while revenue rose 1.04% y-o-y to rm4.21 billion. bloomberg data shows that of 18 analysts that track the group, nine have a buy call on the stock, while six have a neutral, and three, a sell. the average 12-month target price is rm4.70. the stock closed up eight sen at rm4.56 yesterday, bringing a market capitalisation of rm13.75 billion."}, "14": {"date_posted": "8/1/2018", "title": "affordable care goes a long way for

offerings (ipos) in 2018 that could bring in more than rm10 billion by the first half (1h18), and a stronger loan growth of 4% to 5%, said cimb group holdings bhd. the companys group chief executive officer tengku datuk seri zafrul aziz said the countrys second largest lender hopes to be involved in most of the large ipos this year. we cant name the companies, but if you look at the sectors, for equities the jumbo ipos in 2018 are [expected to come] from the infrastructure, financial services and consumer sectors, tengku zafrul said at a media briefing in conjunction with cimbs 10th annual malaysia corporate day yesterday. cimb head of equity capital markets and syndicate asia, derek lim, said the jumbo ipos could raise up to rm10 billion in 1h18. depending on the timing of these transactions we do expect that in 1h18 we should see more than rm10 billion raised from the jumbo ipos, said lim. there is of course the ace market, leap market as well as small-cap and mid-cap fundraising which are expected to be quite robust this year as well given that liquidity has been positive in both capital and equity markets. potential ipos for 2018 that have been reported include qsr brands (m) holdings bhd, which is expected to raise up to rm2 billion; the ports division of mmc corp bhd that is expected to fetch up to rm4 billion; bank islam brunei darussalam bhd which could bring in up to rm2 billion; and the listing of axiata group bhds tower unit edotco group sdn bhd which could raise up to rm2 billion. foreign insurers such as tokio marine holdings inc were also reported to be seeking a listing for its local unit in malaysia this year in order to meet the local shareholding requirement of 30%. tengku zafrul added that the outlook for the fixed income market is positive in 2018, with the bond market seen to remain resilient with expectations of rm90 billion in infrastructure bond and sukuk issuances. as for loan growth in 2018, cimb is looking at a higher range of 4% to 5% for the banking sector as a whole compared with 2017. annualised loan growth for the banking sector came in at 3.3% for the first 11 months of 2017. we will only reveal cimbs targets for loan growth at the end of february when we announce our results. but our house view for the industry is around 4% to 5%. given the size of [the cimb] group in malaysia, we would not be too far off from the industry target, said tengku zafrul. he answered in the affirmative when asked if the robust gross domestic product (gdp) growth in 2017, which averaged at 5.9% for the first three quarters, would translate into better loan growth in 2018. gdp growth last year was above expectations which is positive, and we believe this will translate into stronger loan growth for 2018 compared with 2017. last years loan growth was low due to corporates but this year we foresee that loan growth from corporates would be stronger, he said. most economists are expecting a hike in the overnight policy rate (opr) by 25 basis points in 2018, which would make loans more expensive. however, cimb head of treasury, markets and wholesale banking chu kok wei opined that a rate hike would not have a major impact on loan growth for banks. we dont expect the pricing of loans due to opr [hike] to have a big impact on loan growth. it boils down to the fundamental strength of the economy, like last year [when] gdp growth came in better than expected. also the [general] election has to happen this year so that the overhang issue would be over, hence we do see an upside in corporate investment activities which hopefully translates into fundraising from both loans and also capital markets, he said. tengku zafrul noted that cimb was the best-performing banking stock in 2017, and the second best-performing stock on the fbm klci, yielding total shareholders a return of 51.2%. thanks to the excellent execution of our target 2018 (t18) strategy, the group recalibrated quickly and is now on a sustainable growth path, underpinned by our emphasis on the 5cs which are capital, cost, compliance, customer and culture. i am happy to say that we are on track to meet all our t18 targets by the

metal aluminium holdings bhd by the time press metal was included as an fbm klci constituent on dec 18, the largest integrated aluminium producer in southeast asia already had a market capitalisation of close to rm20 billion. it may be hard to imagine that the stock just crossed rm1 billion market capitalisation barely five years ago, in early 2013. by end-2016, its market capitalisation had risen to nearly rm6 billion, double what it was the year before. when rhbs former analyst ng sem guan started coverage in june 2013, the comparable (adjusted) share price was 39.7 sen. four-and-a-half years on, the stock is up a whopping 1,154% to rm4.98 as at dec 15. total returns are six times higher, with press metal paying dividends every quarter for the past three years, up from twice a year before that, bloomberg data shows. it also had a two-for-one stock split and 40% bonus issue in 2016. ng was also acknowledged for his early buy call on press metal last year. according to bloomberg data, rhbs muhammad syafiq mohd salam reiterated a buy recommendation when assuming coverage on aug 17 this year. in a note dated nov 1, he told clients that press metals size (rm16 billion marketcap) meant that it could be included as an index constituent, about a month before the inclusion was announced. press metal, which ran 113% from the start of the year to rm3.32 on aug 17, appreciated another 50% over four months to rm4.98 on dec 15  bringing total gains for the year to 213%. at the time of writing, rhb still had a buy recommendation and its rm5.30 target price  the highest among four analysts tracking the stock  implying only 6.4% upside potential. risks to his forecast include a sharply weaker greenback, lower aluminium prices and unexpected production disruptions. a notable mention also goes to kenanga researchs voon yee ping, who also rightly stuck with a buy recommendation this year despite the strong price gains. two other houses had neutral calls from april and august when the stock was below rm3.50, bloomberg data show. it remains to be seen if press metal will provide reasons for further bullishness but the stock did reach rm5.47 intraday on dec 4, although its highest close so far was rm5.184 on nov 6.  nomura researchs tushar mohatas call on sunway construction group bhd in a nutshell, this is a winning call because the stock price ran shortly after an upgrade to buy from hold. but theres more depth than that. when nomura researchs tushar mohata upgraded sunway construction group bhd to buy on march 9 this year, the share price rose 45% within nine months to as high as rm2.41 on dec 11, before retracing to rm2.38 on dec 15. before the upgrade, the stock price had largely been hovering between rm1.50 and rm1.60 for about a year. his decision to upgrade sunway construction resulted from what he calls an earnings-cash flow matrix as well as the law of diminishing returns at a time when most construction companies were already sitting on record-sized order books. a high base means small and medium-sized project awards could mean very little incremental impact on future earnings and share price. that came after he revisited nomuras investment thesis for the malaysian construction sector. while net profit remains the best long-term predictor for stock price returns, he told clients that the cash conversion of reported earnings was becoming equally important due to rising gearing in a weak property market. the latter was the reason tushar preferred pure-play malaysian contractors like sunway construction to diversified contractors with exposure to property development. according to him, sunway constructions earnings fairly accurately track its actual cash flows, reflective of its healthy margins and timely collection from customers. thats a better position than companies which may have good reported earnings but subpar conversion of it to operating cash flow due to reasons such as non-cash earnings stream and growing working capital, which leads to higher gearing (thus burdening the balance sheet). a notable mention also goes to macquarie researchs aiman mohamad, who has had a buy call on sunway construction since at least march 2016, according to bloomberg data. both nomura and macquarie currently have the streets most bullish target price of rm2.80.  affin hwang capital researchs kevin lows call on inari amertron bhd inari amertron saw its stock price more than double this year. affin hwangs kevin low, started coverage as early as april 23, 2013, when the comparable stock price was 16 sen. he continues to like inari, calling it a preferred pick for the local technology sector due to its solid growth in the rf segment given new drivers, including the osram iris ir chip, and its data server chip business from broadcom. key downside risks to his recommendation include a slowdown in global demand for smart devices, rapid average sale price (asp) erosion, loss of customer base and the introduction of new technologies that may render inaris products obsolete. according to bloomberg data, there is currently one fully valued call from dbs vickers with a rm2.25 target price. six analysts have hold or neutral calls on inari while the remaining six (including low) recommend as buy. time will tell who will prove prescient this time next year. this year, a notable mention also goes to macquarie researchs anand pathmakanthan, as clients would have benefited from his upgrade from neutral to outperform in january when the stock price was rm1.60. similarly, rhb researchs kong heng siong upgraded his call to buy when the stock price was rm1.90 on march 22. credit suisses danny chan, who started coverage with an outperform call on july 11 when the stock was at rm2.13 apiece, also deserves a notable mention.   affin hwang capital researchs kevin lows call on kesm industries bhd when starting coverage on kesm industries on aug 15, 2016, affin hwangs kevin low told clients the company was a good proxy for the stable and growing automotive semiconductor segment, going by growing demand for electronics for vehicles from safety to infotainment and autonomous vehicles. in just four months, the stock has gained 34%  making him a winner last year. he continues his winning ways this year: at rm19.50 on dec 15, kesm shares had doubled from the start of the year  and theres still upside if lows rm21.80 target price is to be believed. in fact, kesm reached as high as rm20.50 intraday on nov 23 before closing at rm20.40. we favour kesm for its exposure to the automotive space, an area we believe will continue to benefit from structural growth underpinned by increased semiconductor content in automobiles as well as growth in demand for hybrid and autonomous vehicles, low wrote in a dec 18 note, reiterating his buy call. in an earlier note dated nov 24, he told clients that kesms revenue and earnings momentum remained strong, underpinned by aggressive capital expenditure into the automotive burn and test business. he also noted that 1qfy7/2018 net profit would have been stronger if not for higher effective tax rate of 15.5% versus 10.4% in 1qfy7/2017. key downside risks include a loss of customers and a reduction in the outsourcing opportunities as customers increase their in-house burn-in and test function, he says. two other analysts have since started coverage on kesm this year, according to bloomberg data. cimb research has an add rating and rm22 target price while kenanga research is going against consensus with an underperform call and rm18.40 target price, which is below open market prices. it would be interesting to see if low will make it a hat trick next year.   kaf seagroatt & campbell securities mak hoy kens call on econpile holdings bhd econpile holdings shares have gained as much as 77.6% this year, closing at rm3.195 on dec 4. even measured from this years cut-off date of dec 15, gains came to an enviable 73%. in a dec 29 note last year, kafs mak hoy ken retained his buy call. he sees econpile as the research houses top small-cap construction pick for its burgeoning order book, sustained job momentum and attractive margins. the civil engineering contractors market capitalisation breached rm1 billion in late october 2016. back then, he also told clients that more strategic opportunities could stem from econpiles 60:40 tie-up with china communications construction co (m) sdn bhd (cccc) for a substructure and ancillary works package for suke highway, as it was a strong endorsement of econpiles position as a piling specialist in malaysia. at the time of writing, maks target price of rm3.33 implies only 7% upside potential from rm3.11 on dec 15. it remains to be seen just how much comfort should be drawn from his oct 20 note, where he said econpiles earnings visibility remains solid, backed by a healthy outstanding order book of rm1.2 billion or around 2.1 times its construction revenue. meanwhile, macquarie researchs aiman mohamad, who started coverage with an outperform call on feb 23 this year when the stock price was at rm2.07 apiece, also deserves a notable mention, with econpile shares up 50.2% to rm3.11 apiece in about 10 months. macquarie has a rm3.50 target price.  \nkaf seagroatt & campbell securities mak hoy kens call on ann joo resources bhd with shares of ann joo resources bhd up 83% to rm3.80 as at dec 15 this year, investors who bought the stock at the start of the year would be sitting on good portfolio gains. kafs mak hoy ken maintained a buy on the stock with a higher target price of rm2.42 (from rm2.38) on jan 5. the stock dipped to rm2.17  its lowest this year  on jan 3. at its peak, it closed as high as rm3.91 on nov 9. back then, ann joos share price had just gained 224% in 2016 and there were doubts in the market on whether the stock would continue to perform, especially with the direction of international steel prices being mixed at best. mak was held to his belief that there was more upside to ann joo. among other things, he argued that domestic steel prices would see support from provisional safeguard duties on imported bars and wire rods. with the counter trading at only eight to 10 times forward earnings multiples, he was convinced it was a cheaper alternative play to the malaysian infrastructure supercycle. there is also a potential lift from a continued recovery in chinese steel prices as capacity cuts in that country gathers pace. chinese steel prices have been on a general upward trend this year as the countrys supply-side reforms took effect. a notable mention goes to maybank investment bank researchs lee yen ling, who upgraded her call for ann joo on aug 16, 2016, when the stock price was at rm1.72. at the time of writing, maybanks lee has since downgraded her call to hold with a rm3.85 target price while kafs mak continues to call a buy with a rm4.10 target price. watch this space.  \nkenanga researchs desmond chongs call on malaysian pacific industries bhd it was almost as if he had a crystal ball. when kenanga researchs desmond chong upgraded his call on malaysian pacific industries (mpi) from market perform to buy on jan 27, the stock price ran up 79% from rm7.97 to rm14.291 on oct 11. helping the gains were the better sales that mpi was seeing of its automotive electronics and power management chips as well as improved efficiency. he subsequently raised his target price three more times to as high as rm15.70 on aug 18. thats not all. when chong turned cautious on its outlook and downgraded mpi to market perform or a neutral stance on nov 10, the stock price retraced 12% fromrm13.64 to rm12 on dec 15. in a nov 10 note issued following a briefing, he highlighted the mounting pressure on margins coupled with a potential setback from a longer gestation period for its product rationalisation exercise. a special mention also goes to kaf seagroatt & campbell securities shafiq kadir and ta securitiess paul yap, who earlier had buy calls that also proved right. kenangas call got more points as mpi shares ran shortly after his upgrade compared with the two existing buy calls. all three currently have hold calls on mpi, in line with consensus. at the time of writing, affin hwang capital research had the only sell on the stock, with a target price of rm12, according to bloomberg data. will he have the last laugh next year?  \nuob kay hian researchs ridhwan effendys call on kerjaya prospek group bhd investors who made money might recall that uob kay hians retail research team started coverage on kerjaya prospek as far back as january 2016 when it was still called fututech bhd. the team called the stock an upcoming mid-cap construction company that would emerge as an end-to-end building contractor with rm2.7 billion order book after completing the acquisition of two privately-run construction companies. at the time, the (adjusted) stock price was rm1.69. as at dec 15, it had gained 134% to rm3.97, although that is off as high as rm4.08 on nov 3. this year, alone, kerjaya shares were up 83% at the time of writing. on jan 3, uobs ridhwan effendy told clients that 2017 would continue to be an eventful year for kerjaya  which stands out as a potential capital management play  given its strong cash pile of rm107 million or 10% of its market capitalisation back then. according to bloomberg data at the time of writing, uob is the only house still calling a buy on kerjaya, while the remaining two houses with active coverage have neutral or underperform. the underperform call, made in early august when the share price was rm3.54, but the stock is at rm3.97 currently. uob upgraded the stock to buy again on nov 23 with a higher target price of rm4.53 (from rm3.81) after raising its earnings estimates as well as order book win assumptions. ridhwan continues to like kerjaya for its superior margins, high order book cover, net cash of rm163 million (28.9 sen per share) and ability to clinch new contracts.  \nuob kay hian researchs ridhwan effendys call on sunsuria bhd uob kay hian was the first house to initiate coverage on sunsuria nearly three years ago. at the time, the headline recommendation was hold, based on a 50% discount to its sum-of-parts valuation. nonetheless, the research house told clients that it expected the company to take on a major asset acquisition strategy: investors with the risk appetite for small-caps should consider re-entering ahead of the announcement which is expected to be in 1q2015, it said in a brief note dated feb 18, 2015. that gives this submission an edge over others. based on where the stock is today post the corporate developments, the equivalent (adjusted) stock price would be 86.8 sen. a simplistic measurement would show a 78.6% gain at its recent peak of rm1.55 on july 14, 2017. uob kay hians ridhwan effendy raised his target price to rm1.25 (from rm1) when reiterating a buy call on jan 12 this year as he expected sunsuria to enter a multi-year growth phase. riding on the success of xiamen university, ridhwan expects its flagship sunsuria city development to be a key driver for sales and earnings. sunsurias stock price took only about a month to reach the new target price and on feb28, ridhwan raised the target price to rm1.50  which the stock hit on april 10 before retracing to rm1.40-levels. on may 25, ridhwan downgraded the stock to hold with an unchanged target price after the release of the companys 2qfy2017 earnings, telling investors to capitalise on their gains as he believed its near-term potential had been reflected after a 42% year-to-date climb. at the time, the stock price was rm1.41 and the highest it went was a 9.9% rise to a recent high of rm1.55 on july 17 before retracing to rm1.34, about 5% lower than at the point of downgrade.  \naminvestment bank researchs alex gohs call on petronas gas bhd aminvestment banks alex goh got it right when he cut petronas gas to sell from hold on nov 18 with a rm16.65 target price while the stock was trading at rm20-levels. from there, the price skidded 22% to as low as rm15.88 on nov 30. the magnitude of the fall is considerably sharp, given that petronas gas is a big-cap counter with a market capitalisation of rm33.6 billion. in fact, between nov 18 last year and the recent low on nov 30, it lost a whopping rm10.1 billion in market capitalisation. when downgrading his call more than a year ago, goh told clients about the chances of impending earnings erosion given the energy commissions upcoming plan to implement incentive-based regulation (ibr) tariffs on the groups gas transport tariff. that made it hard to justify the companys valuation and share price of above rm20. on dec 5, goh seemed to have also rightly upgraded petronas gas to a hold with a rm16.65 target price when the share price was at rm16.10. closing at rm16.96 on dec 21, the stock had gained 5.3%. meanwhile, it is worth noting that ta securities analyst kylie chan also had a sell call on the stock, according to bloomberg data, when many others on the street still said hold.  \ninter-pacific securities researchs wong ling lings call on uchi technologies bhd 2017 has been a spectacular year for uchi technology, as was inter-pacific securities researchs wong ling lings buy call on the company. the companys share price had gained between 13% and 30% a year between 2012 and 2016 and this year was beginning to look that way as well until a sharp rally occurred from the middle of the year, barely a fortnight from the time she started coverage on the stock with a buy call. uchis performance likely surprised even her. only three analysts are actively tracking uchi, according to bloomberg data. when wong started coverage on june 15, uchi shares were at rm1.84 a share. from there, it rocketed 93% in just over five months to rm3.55 on nov 29. at rm3.45 on dec 15, uchis market capitalisation stood at rm1.57 billion compared with about rm800 million just six months earlier. wongs buy recommendation was premised on the companys stable earnings growth, unique business model, a minimum dividend payout ratio of 70% of profit after tax, very comfortable profit margins and a clientele comprised of industry market leaders. it would be interesting to see if uchi, which specialises in the design of electronic control systems for a number of multinational companies that are global leaders in their respective industries, can continue to surprise on the upside next year.  \nhong leong investment bank researchs jeremy gohs call on george kent (m) bhd this time last year, hlib researchs jeremy goh was the only analyst actively tracking george kent, telling clients that the water meter-turned-engineering company had rm5.1 billion engineering order book and can no longer be ignored. today, he is one of three analysts calling a buy on the company he described as one with 68 sen per share net cash and a key rail play with exposure to the lrt extensions. his target price is currently rm3.90. closing at rm3.62 on dec 15, george kent shares had gained 83% year to date, continuing its ascent from the year before. in a dec 7 note after the companys third quarter earnings briefing, goh noted that george kent  which is the leader for water meters in malaysia, with over

after a large quarterly net loss, uob kay hian researchs kong ho meng stood out as he had had a sell call for close to six months. the stock tumbled 20% in a single day on dec 7, after the group announced a quarterly net loss of rm274.4 million for the third quarter ended oct 31, a sharp contrast to a net profit of rm158 million the year before. looking back, we see that the share price had in fact been drifting lower since mid-june when the consensus view was that the oil and gas giant was in calmer waters as the recovery of global crude oil prices gathered steam. kongs timely downgrade

will only start contributing in 2020 and be a good source of recurring income. the lack of coverage makes affin hwang capitals ng chi hoongs buy recommendation and analysis stand out even more. those familiar with the company would know jaks is undertaking a us$1.87 billion 1,200mw coal-fired thermal power plant project near hai duong, together with china power engineering consulting group co ltd (cpecc). jaks holds a 30% stake in the joint venture and cpecc the remaining 70%. in a jan 4 note, ng raised his target price for jaks to rm2 (from rm1.60) following a review of its assets after the company said it was realigning its focus on vietnam given the slowdown in the property market in malaysia. at the time, jaks share price was at rm1.01. it took barely three months to jump 70% to reach rm1.72 on april 5 before retracing. following the strong rally, ng downgraded his call to hold on may 25 when the price was rm1.58. when it skidded to rm1.38 on oct 17, however, he saw reason to upgrade to buy again with rm1.75 target price. jaks closed at rm1.50 as at dec 20, up 48.5% from the time ng reiterated his buy call with a higher target price. a special mention goes to affins lim

2017, kenanga investment researchs raymond choo boldly recommended that clients buy hartalega holdings shares. he was the only one of 20 analysts tracking the stock to do so, according to bloomberg data. in fact, there was as many as five sell calls. the lack of enthusiasm may have stemmed from the fact that hartalega shares were down 17% year on year in 2016 after gaining 72% y-o-y in 2015. a long-time favourite of investors, the leading nitrile glove maker sprang a surprise rebound this year, rising more than120%. the stock moved from rm4.76 as at end-2016 to rm9.75 on dec 15, our award evaluation cut-off date. as at dec 20, the stock price reached rm11.40! investors who bought shares early this year would have choo to thank. his contrarian stance stemmed from the conviction that hartalega was capitalising on its new capacity from the ngc plant in sepang on the back of robust demand and a slower-than-expected production ramp-up in the other rubber glove players. he was convinced by hartalegas constant desire to move up the value chain by offering superior product innovation and automating its production processes. hartalegas recently announced first non-leaching antimicrobial nitrile examination glove is also expected to be a game changer in the rubber glove industry. inter-pacific securities david lai yoon hui also deserves a notable mention for also having a buy for the most part, save for a blip in may.  \nmidf researchs ng bei shans call on superlon holdings bhd at its peak, superlon holdings bhds market capitalisation reached rm463.7 million when its

last year  the day midf researchs ng bei shan initiated coverage on the maker of synthetic rubber insulators used mainly for heating, ventilation, air conditioning (hvac) and refrigeration  which are important for high-rise buildings and industrial use. the recommendation was based on the prospects for its new warehouse, which would improve lead time and sales; market dominance; and its sturdy balance sheet (rm39.13 million net cash) that spelt dividend payments. in fact, midf had been watching superlon for some months, starting with a non-rated report in march 2016, when its market cap stood at rm159.6 million. measured from nov 21, 2016, the share price appreciated as much as 137% to reach rm2.92 on sept 11 this year. part of the gains were thanks to a share split that the company had hoped would improve liquidity  a move that was rewarded with the entry of institutional investors, including the emergence of kumpulan wang persaraan (diperbadankan) as a substantial shareholder with a 10.49% stake. closing at rm2.15 on dec 15, the counter had skidded 26% from its recent peak but it remains about 75% above the time midf started calling a buy. ng, who had downgraded the stock to neutral on sept 27, when her target price was nearly met and its 1qfy2018 earnings were hit by a spike in raw material price, upgraded her call again to buy on dec 15 following the share price weakness. at the time of writing, its rm2.36 target price implies 9.8% upside potential from current levels.  \naffin hwang capital researchs tan jian yuans call on serba dinamik holdings bhd if you

to become the years best-performing ipo with a gain of 119% as at dec 15. kenanga investment bank was the ipo lead manager. when tan started tracking serba dinamik about two months from its debut, the stock price had already appreciated 10% from its ipo price. yet he was convinced that there was at least 45% more upside potential  and was proved right. at the time, tan was upbeat on its growth potential, expecting strong maintenance activity growth and expansion of engineering, procurement, construction and contracting (epcc) revenue to drive forward earnings. he also expected the group to pay out 25% to 30% of net profits in fy2017 to fy2019, translating into decent yields of3.3% to 5.2%, the initiation report read. a notable mention goes to rhb research institutes wan mohd zahidi, who

target price when the stock was at rm2. investors would also have made good money following their recommendations, despite the later initiation dates. at the time of writing, tans rm4 target price

pipeline of infrastructure projects (driven by rail), we are turning more upbeat on malaysian resources corp bhd (mrcb). the groups infrastructure outlook is shaping up to be more rail-focused (kuala lumpur-singapore high-speed rails [hsr] and east coast rail link [ecrl]), especially for the gamuda bhd-mrcb joint venture, which will be gunning for the project delivery partner (pdp) scope of the hsr project. supported by gamudas rail credentials, mrcb could land its second, but much larger-scaled, pdp contract after the light rail transit line 3s rm9 billion. toll collection for the 100%-owned eastern dispersal link (edl) was abolished on jan 1, 2018. this is part of the governments initiative under budget 2018, whereby toll collections for three highways, namely batu tiga, shah alam and sungai rasau in selangor, bukit kayu hitam in kedah, and the edl, will be discontinued. the expected annual toll compensation is rm70 million as reported by the press, which quoted the second finance minister. the edge markets reported recently that mrcb has been invited by the works ministry to commence negotiations on terms of the mutual termination agreement for the edls concession. we view this development positively as it would bring mrcb closer to concluding the delayed edl deal, carve rm1.1 billion of the edl sukuk (25% of total debt) off its balance sheet, and remove a big overhang on the share price. with an edl sale, its end-september 2017 net gearing of 1.1 times would drop to 0.75 times (by our estimates). we believe mrcbs construction prospects would be enhanced by potential new rail tenders. mrcb and gamuda bhd will be collectively bidding for the pdp role of the hsr infrastructure construction on the malaysian side. based on our calculation and an assumed 6% pdp fee, financial year ending dec 31, 2019 (fy19) to fy20 earnings per share could nearly double with the hsr pdp scope. we believe the worst is over for its share price, having fallen 3.5% in 2017. the stock trades at a 20% discount to its fully diluted revised net asset value (rnav) of rm1.45. this is unjustified, in our view, given the renewed infrastructure/order replenishment outlook and revival of the edl divestment angle, which is long overdue. we think the groups rm2.9 billion total value of jobs in tender has more upside in 2018. our assumed rm800 million job wins per annum could be exceeded if it achieves higher-than-expected success rates for its rail tenders. we believe the rail contract news flow in the first half of 2018 could revive sentiment on the stock. we retain add, in view of the likely positive construction news flow in the months ahead. our tp is raised as we revise the value of selected land banks (at an unchanged 10% rnav discount). we expect more details of the hsr pdp tenders in the next two to three months. potential pdp awards are likely by mid-2018. a key downside risk is weak job wins.  cimb research, jan 2 "}, "20": {"date_posted": "4/1/2018",

traded yesterday compared with tuesdays 3.7 billion shares worth rm2.11 billion. this has prompted some analysts to suggest a pre-election rally could be at play. stocks likely to benefit in the run-up to the 14th general election (ge14) also moved to the upside yesterday. shares in malaysian resources corp bhd (mrcb) climbed 7.8% to rm1.25, while drb-hicom bhd traded up 1.8% to rm2.30. my eg

territory. it is likely the momentum is in anticipation of the countrys general election [taking place] in the first half of this year, hong leong investment bank head of retail research loui low told the edge financial daily on the phone yesterday. this means the dissolution of parliament is likely to happen in february. historically, the malaysian equity market would see a rally before parliament is dissolved. maybank investment bank head of research wong chew hann said there could be a combination of factors contributing to yesterdays strong market performance, noting that regional markets were also on an uptrend. foreign investors have also turned net buyers recently, favourable to the equity market, she told the edge financial daily. in maybank kim eng researchs regional research report dated jan 2, wong is expecting a period of volatility in equities and the ringgit in the run-up to, and post polling day, with a sizeable political newsflow possibly having an impact on investors sentiments. assuming parliament is dissolved just after the chinese new year (feb 16 and 17), we could potentially see higher activity in equities from january to [the] ge14 and some trading opportunities may manifest. our end-2018 fbm klci target of 1,840 points is based on 15.6 times 12-month forward earnings, she added. affin hwang asset management director of equity strategies and advisory gan eng peng pointed out yesterdays spike in the stock market was initially seen on a few politically-linked counters such as mrcb, drb-hicom and fgv, which quickly spread to the rest of the market. retail participation was much higher than normal. this is probably the early stages of a second-tier rally. we expect active rotation among the names at high volume and this is a trading market, gan said via a text message. cimb investment bank head of malaysia research ivy ng also opines that yesterdays strong market performance signals the start of the pre-election rally. the strong klci performance could be due to the january effect and [the] pre-ge14 rally as a special barisan nasional (bn) supreme council meeting will be held today (yesterday) to discuss the preparations for ge14. january is historically a good month for bursa malaysia and historically, it has chalked up a gain of 1.9% month-on-month over the past 40 years, ng told the edge financial daily via an email. rakuten trade sdn bhd vice-president of research vincent lau concurs. this could be the beginning of the much anticipated pre-election rally. there was [a] news report talking about a special bn supreme council meeting on the preparations for the upcoming election. most investors probably didnt want to miss out on the rally and the positive sentiment eventually spilled over to the broader market. if you look at companies such as kub, fgv, myeg and mrcb, most of them are starting to pick up. i think this is just the start of the anticipated pre-election rally and there are still legs for the market to go further, lau said on the phone. he also opines that the current market provides a good opportunity for investors to trade, with the klci on track to breach the 1,800-point level. the klci closed up 10.09 points or 0.57% at 1,792.79 yesterday. however, inter-pacific securities sdn bhd head of research pong teng siew believes the stock market rally is not sustainable, recommending investors to take profit now as trading volume hovers above five billion shares. the last time we saw volume traded over six billion shares was in march last year. so, if the market continues to see higher volume in the near term, it is better to take profit and by the end of the month, you should have taken all the profit that you can, he said. rather, pong reckons yesterdays strong market performance was the result of continuous stimulus programmes by central banks worldwide except that in the us. the [global] market was very unnatural today (yesterday). practically everywhere is going through an upswing cycle including in malaysia due to the stimulus programme from central banks around the world. markets are awashed with money; investors are reacting the only way they can  being bullish, he said. pong opines that the market is overbought despite the good economic indicators in the country, as they did not translate into better corporate earnings during the third quarter ended sept 30, 2017. he also noted that cost escalation was obvious for malaysian companies as observed from the quarterly results. a fund manager with a local asset management reckons local institutional funds will gradually take profit as the election date draws closer. this (strong market performance) was obviously the beginning of the pre-election rally. we could take advantage of the rally by taking some profits as we approach the election. while it appears that the incumbents are on a stronger footing now, the risk of an unprecedented victory by the opposition at the ballot box has not been priced in. there will be a knee-jerk reaction if that happens, and we dont want to be caught off guard. i think when parliament is dissolved, foreign investors could turn net

the current imbalance cost pass through (icpt) for electricity customers from jan 1 to june 30, 2018, saying it would be neutral on its business operations and financial position. at 12pm, tnb rose 1.19% or 18 sen to rm15.30, with 2.89 million shares done. it is one of the top ten gainers on bursa malaysia. the government, in its announcement on tuesday, also said it had agreed to maintain existing electricity tariff rates, which has been in place since jan 1, 2014, until dec 31, 2020. analysts have viewed the government's move to subsidise the electricity tariff as an indication of its commitment to the implementation of the icpt mechanism. in this case, instead of allowing tnb to pass on the cost increment to consumers in the form of a higher electricity tariff, the government is bearing the extra costs in order to maintain the tariff at the current level from jan 1 to june 30, 2018. analysts have reiterated their \"buy\" call on tnb in view of the latest announcement. cimb investment bank bhd analyst ngo siew teng said in a note to clients that while the base tariff remains the same, there is no clarity on the return on assets (roa), capital expenditure or operating expenditure that the government took into account when deciding on the base tariff. \"tenaga has guided that the roa should be within the range of 7% to 7.5% for rp2 (review period 2018 to 2020) compared to 7.5% for rp1 (2014 to 2017). [as such] we leave our forecasts unchanged for now due to limited information. \"we are positively surprised by the government's decision to retain the base tariff when the market is expecting a reduction,\" she added. \"investors had been concerned over its potentially lower return on regulated asset, which would in turn reduce its base tariff and profitability. \"we believe this concern eased with the electricity base tariff rate unchanged at 38.53 sen/kwh until 2020,\" said ngo. midf research said under the new fuel price assumptions, icpt in the first half of 2018 is still effectively in a surcharge position of 0.28sen/kwh. this means actual fuel cost incurred is higher under the recent review on base tariff. it said although the exact details on fuel price assumptions for the current review on base tariff have not been released, it roughly simulated the impact of higher coal price and the us dollar assumptions. \"the decision whether to continue subsidising consumers beyond june 30 next year lies with the government but the fact that tenaga has been kept neutral from the government's subsidy decision in the past two reviews is positive in keeping the ibr (incentive-based regulation) mechanism intact and ensuring tenaga's earnings stability,\" it commented.

highest monthly output recorded by the country for november. in the 11-month period in 2017 (11m17), malaysias cpo output rose 14% to 18.1 million tonnes, forming 83% of our 2017 forecast of 19.4 million tonnes. palm oil exports fell 12% m-o-m to 1.35 million tonnes in november, a bigger decline compared with our estimate of a 6% m-o-m decline, based on cargo surveyors (sgs and its) growth estimates. this was due to the move in india to raise import duty from 15% to 30% while that for refined palm oil has been raised from 25% to 40%. in november, the cpo price discount against soybean oil widened to us$165 (rm674.85) per tonne versus octobers discount of us$146 per tonne to reflect higher palm oil supplies. our initial estimates reveal that palm oil stocks will increase 8% m-o-m in december to 2.76 million tonnes. we project decembers production to fall 12% m-o-m due to disruptions in harvesting activities from higher-than-usual rainfall as well as seasonal factors, and exports to fall 5% m-o-m due to weaker demand. according to its estimates, malaysian palm oil exports fell 16% in the first 10 days of december versus the same period in november. average cpo price for 11m17 rose 6% to rm2,817 per tonne. this is broadly in line with our projection of cpo price to average at rm2,800 per tonne for 2017 and rm2,700 per tonne for 2018. however, we maintain our neutral sector rating as we expect cpo prices to remain weak in the near term due to the higher stocks but to recover in the first quarter of 2018 when demand recovers ahead of the chinese new year festivities. upside risks: higher cpo price and output. downside risks: weaker demand for palm oil, slower new plantings.  cimb research, dec 13\n"}, "28": {"date_posted": "13/12/2017", "title": "hatten land aiming for rapid growth", "article": " singapore-listed hatten land ltd  one of the largest property developers in melaka  is aiming for rapid growth in the coming years, aided by mergers and acquisitions as well as land acquisition and possible asset injection. managing director datuk colin tan june teng says the management is striving to achieve a market capitalisation of s$350 million (rm1.06 billion), followed by s$1 billion in the next few years. year to date, the stock has risen 12% to close at s$0.19 last monday, giving it a market capitalisation of s$258 million. we foresee that we will be a big growth company within a short period of time, especially in the next one to two years. we are looking at acquiring some good companies, quality assets and strategic land bank, he tells the edge in an interview. the 34-year-old singaporean was appointed executive chairman and managing director of hatten land in january. he is also the property firms head of marketing and sales. tan and his elder brother  datuk edwin tan ping huang, who is the companys deputy managing director and executive director  co-founded hatten group sdn bhd in 2006. headquartered in the historical city of melaka, hatten land is the property development arm of hatten group, whose core businesses include property investment, hospitality, retail and education. hatten land began trading on the catalist board of the singapore exchange (sgx) on feb 28 after completing a reverse takeover (rto) of sky win management consultancy pte ltd on jan 24. hatten means growth and development in japanese. today, hatten land is a property developer specialising in integrated residential, hotel and commercial developments. its current portfolio comprises five integrated mixed-use developments and one retail mall in melaka with an aggregate gross floor area of 9.6 million sq ft. its flagship project is hatten city. phase 1, with an estimated gross development value (gdv) of rm2.05 billion, comprises four distinct projects  elements mall, silverscape residences, hatten suites and a tower block, which will be managed by hilton worldwide under the doubletree brand. phase 2, with a gdv of rm1.16 billion, consists of imperio mall and imperio residence. hatten land is also developing harbour city, which comprises harbour city mall, a water theme park and three hotel blocks. it has a gdv of rm1.8 billion. the retail mall it is developing, known as vedro by the river, is valued at rm240 million while satori  which will be melakas first wellness-themed integrated development comprising a mall, hotel and serviced residences  has a gdv of rm300 million. going forward, hatten land could tap into the strengths of hatten group and its comprehensive and vertically integrated business, says tan. for instance, hatten land conducts periodic reviews of land owned by the group to see if any are suitable for development. it has the right of first refusal and call options to acquire 20 extensive land and development rights in high-growth locations nationwide. this arrangement places hatten land in a near-unrivalled position, with priority access to many parcels of prime land, tan points out. outside the group, hatten land is on the lookout for more land in pahang and kuala lumpur, he says. when asked about possible asset injection, tan stresses that hatten land will remain a pure property developer for now, but eventually, we might put everything into the listed company. hatten land has plans to become a regional property player with a presence in vietnam, laos and indonesia. there is a possibility that we will venture overseas with our joint-venture partners. these are the up-and-coming growth countries. i dont want to do the same thing as the other players  investing in london and australia. why should i join the crowd? i would rather go somewhere else and try to achieve something there, tan remarks. closer to home, he says hatten land will continue to bank on melakas growth potential, as the state is anticipated to become a new economic and tourism hub. the mainland chinese want a slice of the action here, while some local developers are also eyeing this market. the bad news for them, which is good news for us, is that there are not many good land bank available anymore in melaka, whereas we own plenty of prime sites. tan adds that the major infrastructure works in melaka will support tourism and investment in the area and, in turn, bolster the value of hatten lands properties and underpin demand for its projects. the upcoming kuala lumpur-singapore high-speed rail has a stop at ayer keroh. we also have weekly scheduled flights to and from guangdong, china, and then theres the construction of melaka gateway in the straits of malacca.  eyeing transfer to main board, dual listing tan reveals that hatten land is planning to transfer to the main board of the sgx. it is also considering listing on bursa malaysia in the future. we did an rto on the main board and then we put it on catalist as we wanted to retain an about 85% stake in the company. in the main board, you need to have a free float of 30%, he explains. according to tan, hatten land prefers to be a big fish in a small pond, being one of the top five companies listed on catalist. if we were to go to the main board, we would be competing against the big brothers with a market cap of billions. right now, it makes more sense for us to stay on catalist. but one day, we hope to go back to the main board. when asked about the possibility of a dual listing, tan replies, we have been thinking about it. if theres an opportunity, we might do it in the future, but theres no specific time frame. i think transferring to the main board will come first; dual listing will come later. on hatten lands share price performance, tan acknowledges that it has been lacklustre but he urges investors not to worry as the major shareholders remain committed to the company. our focus is on getting the company to perform better. of course, we have our own measurement [for the target price], and i think the analyst calls are quite close to what we are looking at. however, we hope to exceed their expectations. a quick check on bloomberg shows that cimb research has an add call on the company, with a target price of s$0.38, while nra capital has an overweight rating with a target price of s$0.46. in the first quarter ended sept 30, 2017 (1qfy2018), hatten land saw its revenue increase 5% to rm56.5 million, thanks to the progress of construction at harbour city, whose last phase  harbour city luxury hotel  will be launched in fy2018. the groups profit after tax grew 63% to rm2.97 million in 1qfy2018, up from rm1.82 million a year ago. strong sales from the first phase of satori lifted unrecognised revenue to rm760 million as at sept 30.

bank negara malaysia said growth is being driven by domestic demand, particularly private sector spending. and all this is happening because consumers and businesses are becoming more confident. thats not all. china, europe and north america are also buying more of our products and net exports are currently at their highest in 14 quarters. in short, malaysia is flying. we are apparently doing so well that bank negara is almost 100% certain to raise interest rates next year. but try and tell the ordinary joe that things are fantastic and he is likely to give me a knuckle sandwich. let me demonstrate. a national public opinion survey on economic hardship indicators by the merdeka centre in early november showed that more than six out of ten malaysians felt stressed about the future. and that four out of ten malaysians either delayed or were unable to pay their electricity or phone bills on time because they simply didnt have the money. three out of ten didnt even have rm500 in emergency funds in their bank account to tide them over in case they lost their jobs. in fact, when merdeka centre pollsters asked malaysians, what is the number one problem facing people in this country today?, they replied, the economy. wait. theres more. retail sales, which are an excellent indicator of consumer sentiment, nosedived in july. notably, the independent retail research firm retail group malaysia downgraded its 2017 forecast to 3.7%  its second revision since the end of last year  to reflect lower purchasing power due to inflation. in banking, its much the same picture too. nomura research recently ranked malaysian banks lowest that those in the philippines, thailand, indonesia and singapore for buying potential because stronger headline growth is not (being) reflected in loans growth. in plain english, this means that folks arent borrowing money at the same pace as the growth of the economy. nomuras report reckons local loans growth this year will be in the region of 4.5%, which is clearly some way lower than the 6.2% gdp growth in 3q. and if bank negara raises rates next year as expected, nomura says this could put more pressure on growth, not to mention risking the economys growth since (bank negara) statistics show that the property sector now accounts for a massive 46.2% of loans in the countrys banking sector. in the advertising and media world, much the same picture emerges. total advertising expenditure as at october was down 10% from a year earlier. only cinema is gaining. everything else, from print and free-to-air tv to radio, in-store media and magazines, is down. even that media stalwart, paytv, is down. in the stock market, its the same. the fbm klcis year-to-date return of 4.4% may sound okay-ish but not when you compare it with other bourses in the region. for the same period, thailands set is up 9.8%, jakartas composite index rose 14.3% and singapores sti jumped 19.3%. as cimb points out in its latest strategy report, earnings growth momentum among malaysias public-listed companies slowed in the third quarter to 1.1%, half what it was on a sequential basis, and clearly a huge anomaly to 3qs 6.2% gdp expansion. so what gives? are bank negaras numbers a fallacy? well, one can always dispute statistics but generally, the trendline is accurate  it is simply impossible, even with all its inaccuracies, mis-estimations and assumptions, for the numbers to deviate all that much from the true picture. growth in singapore, another trade-focused, outwardly facing economy like malaysia, spiked 8.8% in the same third-quarter period, four times higher than in its second quarter (2.2%), itself a massive change in fortunes from its 2% contraction in the first quarter. so yeah, the trendline appears to be consistent. so how to explain it? one way could be to differentiate between the government-linked companies (glc) economy and the rest of the country. as universiti malaya professor of political economy terence gomez and institute for democracy and economic affairs ceo wan saiful wan jan have both said, most of the countrys largest corporations are controlled by seven government-linked investment companies, which in turn fall under the jurisdiction of the ministry of finance. which in plain english, therefore fortifies them from the pressures and vagaries of an open and competitive business atmosphere. and that is one of the chief reasons why global fund managers tend to shun all but the best- managed glcs, since their fortunes are irreversibly linked to the whims of a ruling coalitions ecosystem and the risks of tempestuous national elections. the other reason? malaysia, like australia and china, is experiencing a two-speed economy, which is when larger industry and business sectors grow much faster than the smaller ones, masking their  and the countrys  challenges. in china, ongoing structural reforms have given its services and consumption industries a boost, while its construction and metals industries are bleeding. in australia, the mining, construction and resources boom saw queensland and western australia grow much faster than the rest of the country. in fact, you could even say the world is now a two-speed economy, with recession-hit western economies like france, italy and germany seeing their growth dwarfed by that of emerging economies like brazil, china and india. and thats never a good thing, because uneven growth rarely ends well since it exaggerates the differences between the haves and the have-nots  and the anointed and unanointed  until something gives. imagine the problems of different wages, different living standards, different opportunities, different privileges, different treatments, different rights, etc, etc. you can therefore imagine the delicacies and complexities of managing these disparities for policymakers. so is this yet another ticking time bomb?

implementation of the malaysian financial reporting standard 9 (mfrs 9) are expected to impact the earnings of the banking sector in 2018. most economists have priced in one opr hike by bank negara malaysia next year, while some see two increases if the economy were to grow much faster than expected. midf research analyst imran yassin md yusof expects the net interest margin (nim) of banks to improve slightly from this year due to the potential opr hike. we view that the opr hike will be beneficial to banks, especially those with a higher retail portion of their loans book and higher percentage of mortgages, imran told the edge financial daily. however, there may be some [nim] compression next year due to the net stable funding ratio (nsfr) implementation in 2019 that will moderate the opr hike impact  but, in our view, this will be benign. the implementation of the nsfr will come into effect no later than jan 1, 2019. it is a liquidity standard under basel iii that requires banking institutions to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance sheet activities. alliancedbs research said banks with a larger share of variable-rate loans and a strong current and savings account (casa) base are expected to benefit from an opr hike, provided there is no uptick in asset quality. based on our sensitivity analysis, every 25bps (basis points) hike in opr would raise sector earnings by 2%. we currently assume flat nim trends in 2018, the research firm said in a recent note.  nims to be slightly better aminvestment bank analyst kelvin ong expects nims to be slightly better in 2018 compared with 2017, with a projected improvement of 3bps year-on-year (y-o-y). we expect some repricing of loans to happen in 2018 as a result of the implementation of mfrs 9. with mfrs 9 in place, the banks would have to make more provisions, hence we expect some upward repricing of loans to compensate for the additional provisions, he told the edge financial daily. ong opined that the deferment of the implementation of the nsfr to jan 1, 2019 from the initial date of jan 1, 2018 has lessened competition among banks for deposits. we are seeing some competition among banks for deposits at present, but it is not so intense. also, should the opr hike happen, there will be some improvement to nims as interests earned on loans given would go up first, before the adjustment to interest paid out on deposits catches up, he said. ong said the impact from the implementation of mfrs 9 is expected to be manageable for the banks. the impact [on capital ratios] could range from 25 to 90bps, and we think this is quite a manageable impact for the banks. the day one impact of mfrs 9 to banks would go towards the balance sheet via an adjustment to banks retained earnings, and this will affect banks common equity tier 1 (cet1) ratios, he said. mfrs 9, which comes into force on jan 1, 2018, requires banks to change the way they make loan loss provisions. they will have to make provisions in anticipation of future losses rather than the current practice of making provisions only when loans have been classified as impaired.  loan growth maybank ib research, in a banking sector note last week, lowered its aggregate loan growth forecast for 2018 to 4.2% from an earlier forecast of 4.7%, following the conclusion of the financial results reporting season for the third quarter of 2017 (3q17). the firm had also pared its 2017 loan growth forecast to 3%, from 4.7% previously. industry loan growth slipped further to 4.6% y-o-y in october 2017 from 5.2% y-o-y in september 2017 as non-household loan growth eased further to 4.1% y-o-y from 5.4% y-o-y in september. however, household loan growth maintained its pace at 5.1% y-o-y from 5% y-o-y in september 2017. on an annualised basis, the upward trend in household loan growth was more pronounced, picking up from an annualised pace of just 3% in feb 2017 to 4.5% in october 2017. annualised loan growth for non-household loans was just 1.5% in october 2017. annualised loan growth for the industry was 3.2% in october 2017, the research house said. alliancedbs, meanwhile, noted that loan growth in 2017 has been challenging for banks. loan growth for 3q17 was weak. although there are hopes for a slight rebound in 4q17, loan growth may end the year at only 4% at best. we expect some loan growth recovery in 2018 premised on the spillover from the persistently strong gdp growth. loan growth tends to lag gdp growth by two to three quarters. our loan growth base-case assumption is 5% for 2018, said the firm. as for the banking stock picks, midfs imran had buy calls on a few banks including cimb group holdings bhd with a target price of rm7.10, with the premise that the banking group would see better loan growth and nim in 2018, and an improvement in earnings in thailand and indonesia. alliancedbs top picks included malayan banking bhd (maybank) with a target price of rm10.70. maybank is staging a strong rebound with improved credit costs and no further impairment surprises; its high casa ratio as well as its strong position in capital markets and islamic banking gives it a leg up in the current operating environment, the firm said.  syariah-compliant investments alliancedbs said the creation of more investable syariah equity opportunities in the financial sector, mooted by permodalan nasional bhd (pnb), could spark interest in the sector. in august, pnb was reported to be studying a potential issuance of islamic shares (i-shares) by maybank which will be linked to the islamic banking business of the group. pnb controls 51% of maybank. apart from potentially designating part of maybanks share base as i-shares, we could see a twist involving maybank islamic bhd which may be housed with [the midf group which is wholly owned by pnb]. this is based on reports that midf could be seeking a relisting and obtain an islamic banking licence. we believe other banks may follow suit with the i-share designation if maybank successfully pulls this off, said alliancedbs."}, "34": {"date_posted": "12/12/2017", "title":

"11/12/2017", "title": "execution is key for sime darby property", "article": " at the close of trading last thursday, sime darby property bhd ended at rm1.20 per share, 20% lower than its listing reference price of rm1.50. it is a reflection of the markets wariness of the soft malaysian property market at present, says chairman tan sri abdul wahid omar, who sees a compelling investment case for malaysias biggest developer by land bank. sime darby propertys sales and earnings record have been low when benchmarked against its peers. hence, the selling pressure, he tells the edge, adding that the closing price represents a huge discount of 61% to its revalued net asset value (rnav). share price aside, the new board and management will focus on improving sime darby propertys fundamental performance, he says. to be fair, it has been only one days trading for the demerged companies that used to form the sime darby conglomerate. the spun-off plantation business, now listed as sime darby plantation bhd, ended 58 sen lower at rm5.01. sime darby bhd rose 27% to rm2.35 per share. for perspective, the case for unlocking value by demerging the conglomerate that was sime darby bhd was not premised on simply breaking up into pure-play companies. the intention was also to create value in the long term, based on greater transparency and increased focus by each individually listed companys management. in the case of sime darby property, market observers say investors may be waiting to see how well its management can execute plans and deliver value post-listing. the developer is led by managing director datuk seri amrin awaluddin, a former banker who joined sime darby in the middle of this year. prior to that, he was group managing director of media prima bhd. datuk tong poh keow, former chief financial officer of the enlarged sime darby bhd, is now executive director and chief financial officer of sime darby property. board chairman abdul wahid is also chairman of sime darbys majority shareholder permodalan nasional bhd (pnb), where he is driving a huge restructuring across pnbs major investee companies. post-listing, pnb controls almost 52% in sime darby property. the employees provident fund (epf) has 9.51% while retirement fund inc (kwap) has 5.03%. at the listing ceremony on thursday, abdul wahid remarked that for sime darby property  as with the other sime darby entities  there will be nowhere to hide and it will have to benchmark its performance against the likes of eco world [development group] and s p setia. the investment case for the developer, however, is compelling to him. i believe in the long-term prospects and potential for sime darby property on three counts, he says in a brief reply to the edge. according to abdul wahid, the first is sime darby propertys track record of about 45 years in developing major townships, which totals 23 active townships to date. that is in addition to its role as a partner in londons battersea power station development alongside s p setia and the epf. secondly, it has the largest land bank among malaysian developers at 20,763 acres, spanning from selangor to johor, he says. the land bank does not include options for another 20,000 acres in future growth areas like malaysia vision valley, iskandar malaysia and penang. the developer previously told investors that the option agreements, entered into with sime darby plantation, are valid for five years from the listing date with an option for a three-year extension. as a comparison, the next largest developer by land bank is uem sunrise bhd, which has about 13,000 acres. s p setia has 5,218 acres, excluding 4,263 acres owned by i&p group sdn bhd, which pnb is injecting into the developer. eco world development group has 8,052.7 acres, according to its website. thirdly, it also has a strong financial position with shareholders funds of rm9.6 billion and low gearing level of 12%. this means that we have the financial strength and flexibility to execute development projects moving forward, abdul wahid says. if the developer successfully leverages these factors with the right execution, there may be attractive upside for the stock, according to cimb research. in a nov 29 note ahead of the listing of the demerged conglomerate, the research house put a target price of rm1.85 per share for sime darby property. its valuation is based on a 50% discount to the developers rnav, which is larger than cimbs usual 20% to 30% discount for blue-chip developers. sime darby property has not been actively developing its land bank, which we believe has resulted in relatively lower returns for its shareholders, says cimb, remarking, however, that the developers asset value exceeds its market capitalisation despite a flattish and uninspiring near-term earnings outlook. as our valuation does not include the potential value enhancement from additional land bank of 20,602 acres under malaysia vision valley option agreements and land option agreements, we see further upside to our rnav and target price if sime darby property manages to monetise or develop these sites in the future, the research house says. moving forward, the spotlight will be on how sime darby property manages its vast land bank. for investors banking on the management to get this aspect right, the investment play in the counter may require a longer-term perspective. we are taking a three-pronged approach to take advantage of this huge land bank  own development of land within and adjacent to our existing core townships/developments and partnering parties who can add value, says abdul wahid, adding that the developer will also look at monetisation of a portion of land not within our immediate focus areas. abdul wahid reiterates his confidence that the greater focus, capital allocation and transparency of performance post-demerger will help the three demerged entities do well, thus creating more value for the shareholders. a new beginning indeed for all three entities, he says.

watchers have increasingly observed bubble-like conditions in various asset classes around the world. this everything bubble phenomenon has made investors apprehensive. will the asset prices be sustainable or will there be a drastic correction soon with far-reaching repercussions? in mid-october, the market capitalisation of the standard & poors 500 index breached the 23,000-point mark for the first time. this came only a few months after the index broke above 22,000 points in august, which led research firms to declare that the stocks were overvalued. technology stocks, for instance, have seen high valuations in recent years. facebook, amazon, netflix and google (also known as the fang stocks) alone make up about 7% of the s&p 500s market capitalisation. in asia, tencent holdings ltd is one of the highest valued stocks in the world, having surged 2,636% in the past 10 years. meanwhile, the technology sector has surpassed finance as the largest component of the msci all country asia pacific index for the first time since the dotcom bubble. some investment experts say while many assets are looking expensive, they have not yet reached a bubble-like stage. the quantitative easing exercises of major central banks over the past eight years have resulted in asset prices rising sharply. now, valuations are no longer cheap in many equity and bond markets. however, they are not exorbitant either and nowhere near the valuations seen during the dotcom bubble of the early 2000s, says vasu menon, vice-president and senior investment strategist at ocbc singapore. patrick chang, chief investment officer at cimb-principal asset management, says the market is currently not at exuberant levels, so there is no reason for investors to be alarmed. if there was a bubble, the s&p 500 would be trading above a price-earnings ratio (per) of 23 times. today, it is only at about 19 times based on current forward earnings. its equity risk premium is quite limited at 6% compared with the typical equity risk premium of close to 4%, which means the market participants are quite sceptical about this value, he adds. historically, most bubbles are observed as bubbles in the aftermath. but chang says while the everything bubble scenario cannot be dismissed entirely, it is highly unlikely. we have a scorecard that we have monitored since september and it has a checklist of the risks in the market. the things we monitor include the us federal reserve rate hike, the us yield curve, unemployment rates, valuations, earnings per share growth and chinas gdp, he adds. if we were to compare all of these indicators today with those in october 2007, only two of the 12 indicators would be flashing. so, it is not alarming when they are historically compared. lim chia wei, assistant portfolio manager at affin hwang asset management bhd, says while us assets are looking expensive, asia is not in a bubble territory. shiller per (share price divided by the average of 10 years of earnings, adjusted for inflation), which has been quite reliable as an indication of long-term performance, is now at 31 times  a high we have not seen since the dotcom bubble. typically, if the shiller per is very high, the overall return of the market in the next 5 or 10 years will be lower, he adds. however, this is not the case here in asia. the forward per of the msci all country asia ex-japan is at about 13 times, which is not a huge stretch. what could be considered a stretch in this region is 16 times and above. the dotcom bubble  one of the biggest in history  was the result of easy capital, market overconfidence and pure speculation during the rise of internet companies. at the time, companies that had yet to generate profit, revenue or even a finished product went to market with initial public offerings that saw their share prices triple or quadruple in a single day. eventually, companies that reached market capitalisations of hundreds of millions of dollars became worthless in a matter of months. there will not be a repeat of this today as technology is more heavily consumed than before, says chang. we are living in a world where technology is a really big part of day-to-day life and one of the biggest drivers of earnings globally. for example, previously only 15% of the msci china was in technology. today, due to companies such as tencent, alibaba group holding ltd and baidu inc, 35% of the index are technology stocks, he adds. these stocks are still growing. so, i think that as long as the earnings continue to support and grow in this environment, where there is a lot of liquidity and margins continue to expand, the markets will continue to go up. nevertheless, there are still risks. according to an oct 20 moodys research report, real gross domestic product growth has slowed to 1.9%, annualised on average in conjunction with the 229% average debt-to-gdp ratio since 2001. people are quite concerned about the slowing economic growth resulting in more leverage. but to put things into perspective, this can only be an issue if we believe that the fed, the european central bank or the bank of japan is going to tighten more significantly than it should, says chang. menon concurs, saying that the biggest risk for markets going forward is a shift in global monetary policy to a more hawkish-than-expected stance. this could happen if inflation, which has been unusually low so far, surprises on the upside. the unemployment rate, which is the most understandable measure of excess capacity is close to the lows of previous cycles across the developed markets, he adds. as excess capacity shrinks, wages and inflation could rise and central banks could be forced to turn more hawkish, which may cause a significant correction. if us president donald trump manages to push through tax cuts and reforms and give the us economy a shot in the arm, it could change the feds gradual approach to raising interest rates. this could spook investors and cause a correction down the road as well.  market rallies sustainable the global equity market has done tremendously well this year on the back of improving economic data, compared with the lows seen in the first half of last year. according to bloomberg data, the year-to-date return of the nasdaq composite index, s&p 500 and s&p europe 350 index stood at 25.5%, 15.45% and 7.19% respectively as at nov 14. asia is experiencing an equity rally, with the year-to-date returns of the india nse nifty 50 index, taiwan stock exchange weighted index, shanghai stock exchange composite index and south koreas kospi coming in at 24.91%, 15.46%, 11.09% and 24.87% respectively. it has been a very good year for equities, rallying on the back of higher earnings, particularly in the developed countries. the reason equity markets have done very well is that there is an abundance of liquidity while volatility and inflation are low. if any of these three things start to be out of the norm, it will stall the rally, says chang. despite the asian equity rally, malaysias stock market has been underperforming its regional peers. the fbm klci has seen a year-to-date return of only 5.83% compared with the double digits of its peers. the ringgit is cheap, but i think people are still waiting for the general election to be out of the way. usually, markets do not like uncertainty. so, when the uncertainty is removed, the markets recalibrate. the budget was expansionary and inflation is less concerning. so, between fixed income and equities, we are more bullish on malaysias equity market, says chang. he adds that the fairly weak us dollar this year has become a positive tailwind for various asset classes, including global equities, emerging market (em) stocks and em fixed-income instruments. ems were massive underperformers between 2013 and 2016. this year, it is no longer the case. there has been an earnings upgrade, the dollar has been weak and commodity prices have started to stabilise. led by china, ems are the biggest global technology and industrial contributors, which are driving changes in the economy. so, we are watching the china inflation and monetary policy very carefully. there is also the risk of the us dollar rising dramatically if trump is able to execute his fiscal policy in a strong manner, which is expected to lead to a us dollar rally and corrections in ems. but that is not the case at the moment. it is quite benign. chang believes that the growth story will continue, citing the equity per rerating versus earnings. the exuberance that we were talking about can only happen if the per rerates faster than earnings, but this has not happened yet. the bulk of the equities this year has been driven by earnings upgrades rather than a rerating, he says. as long as the earnings continue to deliver, we will continue to see growth. it wont surprise me if at some point, there is some disappointment on the earnings side. there may be some corrections, but i think this is a natural occurrence in a bull market. most of the rally this year has been confined to the tech sector. but sectors such as financial, industrial and infrastructure are starting to see growth as well, says chang, especially with chinas one belt, one road (obor) initiative that is expected to result in better investment returns in the region.  properties and cryptocurrencies real estate prices have been rising at an unprecedented rate around the world. in late september, the number of cities that are at risk to a bubble in ubs global real estate bubble index rose to eight  the highest in three years. the cities included toronto, london, hong kong and sydney. affin hwangs lim says there is no reason for local investors to be concerned, unless they are invested in canadian or australian properties. according to a mauldin economics report released on sept 20, the real residential housing price index for canada was 413.9 last year, compared with 36.3 in 2010. meanwhile, the sydney residential property price index was 167.6 last year, compared with 98.9 in 2010. if you measure it as a percentage of disposable income  in other words, affordability  property is definitely in the high levels at such places. here in malaysia, it is undoubtedly higher than before, so there is a lot of public sentiment that property prices are way too high. but if you compare local properties with the rest of the world, they are nowhere close, says lim. according to a report by the ministry of finances valuation and property services department, the malaysian house price index increased by only 5.3% in the first quarter of this year, compared with 7.1% in the previous corresponding period. in the past five years, the highest number recorded was 13.4% in 1q2012 while the second highest was 11.2% in 1q2013. this is an indication that the malaysian property market is not in a bubble, says zerin properties ceo previn singhe. a property bubble is caused by a run-up in housing prices, speculation and market exuberance, which we are not experiencing. asking prices have dropped, which means people are ready for deals. loans are also cheap, with many saying that bank negara malaysia is expected to raise the overnight policy rate in january next year. so, i think there is definitely opportunity in the market, says previn. it was recently reported that certain segments of malaysias housing market are facing a glut. unsold completed residential units rose 40% to 20,807 units in the first half of this year (worth rm12.26 billion) from the same period last year. according to news reports, the majority of the overhang were condominiums and apartments priced above rm500,000. this, however, is not a cause for concern, says tang chee meng, chief operating officer at henry butcher malaysia. according to him, the unsold stock only comprises units that are not sold within a certain period of time  not that they will never be sold. it is not surprising because it just indicates that the property market has been sluggish. the largest segment is properties priced at rm500,000 and above, which again is not surprising because the government has been focusing on affordable homes. even the developers have switched focus and are building affordable homes, says tang. previn concurs, saying that only 20% of the total transactions in malaysia is from developers. the remaining 70% to 80%, which currently sustains the sector, is contributed by the secondary market. so, the 40% increase in unsold units just signals the need for developers to change their strategies to get their units sold. despite this, there are still a lot of projects that are getting good response from property buyers due to their prime location, says tang. generally, if the location is good, even rm500,000 is considered cheap by investors, especially if they compare with the prices in the previous peak market. the property market probably peaked around 2013. although the volume of transactions continued to go up until 2015, it is currently on the downward side of the cyclical curve and has not picked up yet and prices have dropped. so, i do not think that we are leading up to a situation where the market is building up and another bubble is coming. the percentage of loan approvals was still high at 74.2% in the first quarter, so i think it is more a subdued environment than a bubble, says tang. however, carmelo ferlito, senior fellow at malaysian think tank institute for democracy and economic affairs, says malaysia is indeed experiencing a housing bubble and the unsold properties are its natural consequence. what is happening in malaysias property sector happened to the us and europe about 10 to 15 years ago, just with a time lag. i am not a financial adviser, but i think this is the moment where prices are terribly high and i would wait until the bubble bursts to buy, he says. there are two dynamics contributing to the malaysian property bubble  the tendency of imitation and easy access to credit, says ferlito. he explains that investors tend to exploit a certain sector when they realise that there are profit-making opportunities, leading to an overexpansion of the sector  in this case, properties. when the investments are targeting a certain sector, the positive asset to the rest of the economy tends to be overemphasised because of malinvestment into that sector. coupled with easy credit, the malaysian property sector is being driven to a speculative boom, says ferlito. meanwhile, in the cryptocurrency universe, the most glaring sign of a bubble is the surge in bitcoin prices. the digital currency has risen more than 500% this year. there was a significant price increase in the last few weeks after it was announced that segwit2x (segregated witness code optimisation to increase the block size to 2mb) had ended. following the announcement, bitcoins value rose to an all-time high of us$7,800 before falling to us$7,000 as the market reacted. this prompted many renowned investors such as warren buffett to express concern. you cant value bitcoin because it is not a value-producing asset ... it is a real bubble in that sort of thing, he reportedly said. on nov 5, goldman sachs analyst sheba jafari predicted in a note that bitcoin would go past us$7,900. she noted that bitcoin had exceeded an equality target from its july low of us$6,044, indicating the potential of an impulsive advance that could hit at least us$7,941. affin hwangs lim is concerned about the surge in bitcoin prices and suggests that investors be extra cautious when investing in the cryptocurrency. i am definitely not an expert in bitcoin, but i sense that most retail investors do not fully understand what the cryptocurrency is, its underlying technology and its value despite knowing its price history. one common motivation that i have heard from people investing in bitcoin is that there is a fair chance that bitcoin can replace fiat currency, so they want to protect their wealth by diversifying into the digital currency, he says. but i can offer a simple alternative. if you invest in a real asset  for example, tenaga nasional bhd shares  in the long term, no matter how the world operates, whether using fiat or cryptocurrency, you will still get paid. people still need to use electricity, so you will get your dividends. i am not against bitcoin investment, but investing in a real asset is always a safer bet compared to jumping in when prices are skyrocketing. you dont know when the peak is and you face the risk of permanent loss if the asset collapses. john chan, chief operating officer at software development company crypto securities, says while he will not call the current bitcoin situation a bubble, any significant price hike fuelled by speculators banking their hopes on a future event will definitely see a correction. that said, bitcoin has had more than 170,000 pending transactions stuck on the network due to the slow transfer speed. this is the situation that led to the price dropping to us$800 earlier this year, he adds. going forward, i think it is best for investors not to speculate and invest based on future bitcoin upgrades, as shown time and time before. speculation in the cryptocurrency space is an extremely high-risk, high-reward type of investment and should be compared to gambling rather than investing.  strategies to deploy given the uncertainties ahead, ocbcs menon says it is important for investors not to concentrate all their investments in one area. investors should diversify their core investments across asset classes and phase in fresh investments in the market over the next 12 to 18 months. there should be a mix of equities, bonds and cash among the investment holdings. investors can also consider holding a small percentage of gold as a safeguard or insurance against bad news, he says. those with a stronger risk appetite can have a more significant part of their portfolio in equities and a smaller percentage in bonds, while those with a lower risk appetite can consider having a bigger share in bonds compared with equities. menon says the house view is currently cautious on equity markets, neutral on us and european equities and underweight on asia. this does not mean that we are telling investors to sell asian equities in favour of us and european stocks. it still makes sense to invest in asian equities if you are a long-term investor looking beyond 12 months. but you want to put more into the us and european stocks on a relative basis because these markets are seen as more defensive. in terms of bonds, menon says high-yield bonds offer some buffer to rising interest rates as central banks around the world could tighten policy down the road and raise rates. therefore, high-yield bonds should continue to be sought after by investors looking for income and yield. he also suggests investors have a cash buffer to protect their portfolios, with the intention to go on the offensive if there is a market pullback. usually, a cash allocation of 3% to 5% in ones investment portfolio can be considered when one is fairly confident of the market outlook and sees more upside for equities and bonds. but after the kind of rally we have seen this year so far and given the rich valuations currently, it makes sense for investors to be more careful and perhaps take some profit off the table and hold a higher percentage of cash, perhaps closer to 10%, so that the funds can be redeployed in markets should there be a sharp pullback. however, affin hwangs lim advises investors not to increase their defensive allocation and not to be too worried about the possibility of a bear market with a long-term investment horizon. you should stick to your asset allocation in good times and in bad. lets say if sometime in the future, whether it is next year or three years from today, there is a bear market and the stock market corrects by 30% to 40%, you should not panic and continue to invest regularly. it has been proven that if you stick to the plan and stay disciplined, you will be able to meet your financial objectives, he says. i am saying this because when everything is rallying, investors tend to guess the peak and try to match their allocations to their predictions. but in reality, most of us cannot time it. we do not know when the bubble will burst. he points out that many highly qualified strategists called for the peak of the market two years ago, but it continued to rally much higher. therefore, it is not very wise for retail investors to time the market. even if they get it right, it is most probably due to pure luck. essentially, if you try to predict such opportunities, you will realise that you are often wrong. you will realise that your success rate is very low. that is why i suggest that investors have a long-term investment plan and strategy and maintain it until their retirement. this is how you do it right, says lim. chang says cimb-principal has adopted a balanced view and will continue to advocate a mixed-asset combination of equity and fixed-income funds. on a month-on-month market basis, fixed income may not do so well. but if the yields start to pick up, it may be interesting. so, investors may get some form of yield in their portfolios on top of reaping the returns of the well-performing equity market. we are not saying we are ultra-cautious, we are just thinking there could be opportunities if investors make the most out of both assets, says chang."}, "43": {"date_posted": "23/11/2017", "title": "cimb ib research keeps hold on wct, lowers target to rm1.77 ", "article": "

revenue growth was mostly due to the sturdy growth in domestic demand (up 4% y-o-y) as well as expanding sales from its exports (up 5.5% y-o-y) as a result of new product launches and effective marketing and trade promotions.nonetheless, earnings were clipped y-o-y due to the different timing of marketing expenses and higher raw material costs (for example, milk powder and coffee beans). 3qfy17s top line improved 4.8% y-o-y; however, cnp fell 25.5% y-o-y to rm119.7 million. sales growth was mainly led by sturdy and positive y-o-y growth from its export business (up 4.2% y-o-y) and solid fundamental domestic demand (up 6.8% y-o-y). cnp, however, was down y-o-y on the back of increased raw material costs. 3qfy17 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation

91 sen: on wednesday, signature international bhd announced that the employees provident fund (epf) has become a major shareholder of the company with 11.6 million shares or a 5.07% stake. we believe epfs stake in signature was acquired on its own and not via external fund managers. this is a positive surprise to us and we see this as a long-term positive for the company. we believe epfs interest in signature is driven by the formers development of the major 2,330-acre (942.92ha) kwasa damansara (kd) project and it sees potential synergies with signature. we believe signature stands a good chance in being involved in the kd project in the near future. other than kitchen works, where signature is the countrys largest player, the company is also involved in the distribution of white goods (air conditioners, refrigerators and stoves) and the manufacturing of aluminium and glass products. in addition, signature has an internal interior outfit division. signature could offer these services and more to epfs property development projects. signatures current outstanding order book is strong at around rm280 million, compared with only rm200 million a few months ago. many of its projects that were previously delayed are now being completed. this should ensure strong revenue growth for the company in the financial year ending june 30, 2018. however, a strong order book may not translate into high profits. rubber and rubber wood prices have remained stubbornly high over the past few months, and this could eat into signatures profit margins as most of its order book jobs were finalised before the spike in rubber wood prices at the end of the previous year. we believe the company is also targeting to grow its revenue via the export market. to minimise project risk overseas, signature only supplies raw materials to its export customers, who then carry out the installation on their own. although the government has banned the export of rubberwood since july 1, this does not affect signature as its products have been value-added and can be exported. signatures share price has been trading sideways since 2015 between the 80 sen and rm1 levels. unless its share price breaks out above the rm1 level, we believe the sideways trend will be sustained. we maintain our earnings per share forecasts and tp, based on an unchanged 40% discount to sum-of-parts. the stock remains a hold, but we like signatures long-term potential with epf as a major shareholder. upside risks include strong export sales. downside risks are continued weak domestic sales and high raw material

"56": {"date_posted": "4/10/2017", "title": "japans mufg cites capital efficiency as reason for exiting cimb ", "article": " cimb group holdings bhds japanese shareholder of 43 years and one of its biggest over the last decade, mitsubishi ufj financial group inc (mufg), made an unexpected exit from the countrys second largest banking group last wednesday. it sold its entire 4.56% stake, or 412.51 million shares, through an overnight block trade at rm6.20 a share, or rm2.56 billion in total. it was a 4% discount to last tuesdays closing price of rm6.46. according to bloomberg, the shares had been offered to investors at a range of rm6.15 to rm6.30 apiece. two thirds of the shares went to foreign shareholders, including fund managers, sources say. industry observers say mufgs 43 years in cimb is possibly one of the longest ever that a foreign investor has held on to a malaysian bank. mufg first became a shareholder in the group in 1974, when it made an investment through one of its predecessors, the sanwa bank ltd. interestingly, mufgs exit comes even as another japanese investor, sumitomo mitsui banking corp (smbc), is considering divesting its stake in rhb bank bhd, a lender with which it has had a relationship spanning over 40 years. smbc is mulling over the sale of its 0.06% stake, or 2.359 million shares, in rhb bank, a source tells the edge. the stake was valued at rm12.46 million, based on rhb banks closing price of rm5.28 a share last thursday. mufgs exit from cimb came as somewhat of a surprise to analysts, but they say the move makes sense as the japanese financial group needs to optimise capital amid stricter requirements under basel iii. the sale makes sense. any banking group with small equity stakes [in other financial institutions] would want to tidy up their holdings because they weigh on risk-weighted assets. divesting such stakes could improve capital efficiency, says a local banking analyst. mufgs stake in cimb was held through its subsidiary, the bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj ltd (btmu). btmus common equity tier 1 (cet 1) ratio, at 11.34% as at end-june, was the lowest among japans three major banks. smbcs stood at 13.11% while mizuho banks was at 11.46%. maybank invesment bank research, in a report on cimb last wednesday, says mufgs sale of cimb shares could boost btmus cet 1 ratio slightly to 11.4%. an mufg spokesperson confirms that the decision to sell the cimb shares was to improve capital efficiency. she stresses that the sale did not imply a change in its view of cimbs prospects. the sale of shares is for the purpose of the improvement of capital efficiency of mufg/btmu, and the implementation of the sale of shares does not mean that [we] have changed our regional strategy. asia remains one of the most important regions for us. therefore, there is no impact on mufg/btmus business in malaysia, kana nagamitsu, of mufgs public relations division, tells the edge via email. she adds that the group will continue to collaborate with cimb, despite no longer being a shareholder. for decades, it has cooperated with cimb in many areas, including commercial banking, investment banking, islamic finance and asset management. we will continue to have a collaboration with cimb. [the sale] does not imply a change in our view of the prospect of cimb going forward ... its very much an internally mufg/btmu-driven decision. in fact, there will be no change in the status of cimb as one of our alliance partners in asean, she says. in a press release posted on its website on sept 20, mufg says it sold its cimb stake as part of a larger plan to optimise capital management amid tightened international financial regulations and changes in the business environment. in such a context, mufg is conducting a review of existing strategic investments by the mufg group of companies from the viewpoint of strategy, capital efficiency and profitability of investment, among others, it says. nomura research, in a note on mufg, says it views the sale as a positive step in the japanese groups review of its existing investment portfolio, which forms part of its initiatives to improve productivity under the mufg re-imagining strategy, which it unveiled in may. given the size of the sale at over u00a560 billion, we think this move will send a clear message that mufg, as a megabank that has seen its profitability decline under its previous strategy of expansion, is becoming more selective in its portfolio in order to prioritise productivity and investment efficiency, its analyst ken takamiya says. mufg has branches in malaysia, and we think the importance of malaysia and the rest of southeast asia to mufg is unchanged. mufg got the equivalent of about u00a568 billion from the sale. the sale will have only a minor impact on mufgs and btmus financial results for the year ending march 31, 2018 (fy2018), mufg says. mufgs net profit has declined over the last two years, from u00a51.03 trillion in fy2015 to u00a5951.4 billion in fy2016 and u00a5926.4 billion in fy2017. its shareholding in cimb has varied over the years. in the last decade, the largest stake it held was 5.02%, in 2013. it has one representative on cimbs board, namely hiroaki demizu. now that it has exited the malaysian lender, it is understood that he will resign from the board. cimb, in response to questions from the edge, notes that, as with many banks around the world, capital optimisation is an important theme. the evolution of capital allocation and treatment over recent years means that capital management has become increasingly challenging for all banks, a spokesperson says. in fact, cimb, too, is in the process of divesting its 18.21% stake in bank of yingkou in china on the back of capital treatment and priorities, the spokesperson adds. mufgs exit comes during a year in which shares of banks, including cimbs, have run up as investors bet on a recovery in earnings after tepid growth in the previous year. cimbs share price has risen 43.86% so far this year, hitting a high of rm7.08 on aug 30. the counter closed at rm6.35 last thursday. nomura research believes the shares still have upside potential. it upgraded the stock to a buy from neutral last thursday and raised its target price by rm1.50 to rm7.90, citing cimb as the only stock within its coverage of malaysian banks to have a meaningful return on equity (roe) turnaround story. it expects cimbs roe to rise from 8.2% in 2016 to around 10% in 2018, notwithstanding the impact from the mfrs9 accounting standard, which will kick in from next year. maybank ib, meanwhile, maintains a buy on cimb with a rm7.50 target price.

used in the wholesale money market that are regularly purchased and traded by institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals in the stock market. retail nids (r-nids) work like fixed deposits, where investors have the choice of depositing their money for a fixed period of time to generate a higher interest rate than those offered by banks for fixed deposits. retail investors are individuals and eligible small and medium enterprises. bank negara malaysia introduced the r-nid so that retail investors can have another savings option while banks can have an additional source of capital to help them better manage their liquidity profiles.  features participating banks are allowed to offer r-nids with maturities of up to five years to retail investors, says bank negara. the minimum investment amount for regular nids is rm60,000, but the minimum investment amount for r-nids is only rm10,000.  while no benchmarks have been set in terms of interest rates, participating banks could offer an interest rate of 4% to 4.5% for r-nids, compared with the average rate of 3% for fixed deposits. another interesting feature is the flexibility given to investors to sell their r-nids to the issuing bank before their maturity. there is no penalty imposed on the accrued interest, unlike fixed deposits, where an early withdrawal usually results in a loss of at least 50% of the accrued interest.  public bank bhds r-nid has a predetermined maturity of 15 months at an interest rate of 4%. affin bank and kenanga investment bank offer r-nids with maturities of one month to five years, with interest rates of 3% to 4.1%.according to bank negara, alliance bank, cimb bank and rhb bank are expected to roll out their r-nid programmes in the near future.  risks like all investments, r-nids come with risks, namely interest rate risk and credit risk of the issuing bank. similar to bonds, the market value of r-nids increases when the interest rate falls, which results in a capital gain for investors if they decide to sell their r-nids at that point. likewise, the market value of r-nids decreases when interest rates go up. with regards to interest rate risk, investors should take note that the market value of longer-tenured r-nids is more sensitive to changes in interest rates compared with shorter-tenured ones. for example, compared with a one-year r-nid, a five-year r-nid would see a larger gain or loss in market value when interest rates change. from a credit risk perspective, investors need to be mindful that the value of their r-nids may be negatively affected should the issuing bank face trouble as r-nids are not covered by the perbadanan insurans deposit malaysia (pidm) scheme, which insures normal deposits in the event of a bank failure."}, "58":

stands at 8.6% and at 6.03% over a two-year period. looking at these facts, it may seem malaysian stocks have had a good run year to date (ytd), tempting a wary investor to back away from stocks or expect next to nothing more over the coming three months. yet, according to credit suisse equity research, the biggest surprise of 2017 remains that malaysia is one of four markets in asean that have been left behind during the emerging markets equity rally seen in the last five years. the others are thailand, indonesia and the philippines. during the one-year and two-year periods, the msci ac asia pacific ex japan index returned 19.8% and 14.5% respectively. singapores straits times index (sti) had returns of 16.7% and 9.1% over the same periods, while thailands set index earned 16.2% and 16.98% respectively. the jakarta composite indexs return, meanwhile, stood at 9.8% over a one-year period and 26.8% over a two-year period. the philippines psei index has yet to recover from its collapse two years ago as the index saw a negative return of 0.29% over a two-year period despite recording a return of 7.4% over a one-year period. still, credit suisse pointed out that malaysia stands out as by far the most unloved larger mainstream emerging market by dedicated emerging market funds. this consensus bearishness is reflected on the sell-side, with analyst buys less holds and sells (as a percentage of total outstanding recommendations) close to a seven-year low [albeit with some improvement in sentiment over the past year], placing the market as the third most unloved larger emerging market after poland and chile, the foreign research house said in its global emerging market equity strategy dated sept 18. this points to significant scope for a shift-up in analyst sentiment, coupled with a marginal buyer among emerging market funds to re-engage the market. credit suisse reiterated its overweight stance on malaysia, noting the significant acceleration in gross domestic product (gdp) growth above consensus expectations. credit suisse malaysia economist michael wan maintained his above-consensus forecast of 5.6% real gdp growth for 2017 and believes a sharp slowdown through the second half of the year is unlikely given the reducing negative impact of past subsidy cuts, supportive fiscal dynamics with a potential pickup in government infrastructure projects and improving private consumption. credit suisse also noted that the ringgit looks cheap at current level after substantial depreciation of 29% in nominal terms versus the us dollar since may 2013. with the exception of just two markets (russia and egypt), it said ytd us dollar price performances of malaysia, together with the philippines and indonesia, are also the worst across all 24 msci emerging market country indices. the research firm is forecasting the ringgit to strengthen to 4.0 against the us dollar over the next 12 months from 4.2 currently. cimb equity research shared the same view on malaysias improving fundamentals, saying in its strategy report dated sept 20 that investors broadly agreed that macro risks had subsided, following the stronger-than-expected upturn in malaysias economy, which saw it grow 5.7% year-on-year in the first half of 2017. many, however, pointed out that consumer confidence, business sentiment and corporate earnings continued to lag the robust headline gdp growth numbers, it said. potential reasons for slower-than-expected corporate earnings growth against better-than-expected gdp growth remain as some of the key questions at the top of investors mind, cimb added. cimb is maintaining its fbm klci target of 1,790 points for the year, with the market to trade rangebound as it awaits new catalysts to drive the market. these include stronger-than-expected corporate earnings and strong foreign fund inflows. in a report last friday, midf research said it is reiterating its year-end 2017 fbm klci baseline target of 1,830 points, which may further decline going forward in view of the potential upward revisions in earnings. it also introduced a fbm klci target for 2018s year end (top down) at 1,900 points. the local research firm noted that by peer comparison, valuation of the fbm klci is cheaper than most regional markets. as at close of week ended sept 15, the price-earnings ratio of fbm klci stood at 16.7 times based on current year earnings. with a coefficient of variation of 0.83, the valuation of fbm klci is cheaper in comparison to other regional markets except singapores sti, it added. midf research also reckoned that the current account will improve this year, bucking the downtrend established since 2011. higher commodity prices have so far translated into better terms of trade, which in turn drive bigger trade surplus. for the first seven months of the year, trade balance reached rm51 billion, it said. it also noted that while momentum of foreign funds into malaysian equity had moderated, it remained in positive territory until sept 15, 2017, albeit being lower than the previous two quarters of rm815.3 million. looking at trends of foreign flows over the past few years, foreign flows tend to taper during the second half of the year especially towards the year-end festive season. however, we expect the flow of foreign funds to remain favourable going forward premised on positive sentiment on emerging currencies, ringgit in particular, and supported by solid economic growth and trade figures, it added.  fragile sentiment from external news a pullback for equity market the fbm klci fell 1.9% to close at 1,755.58 points last friday from 1,789.86 on sept 12 this year  the highest level reached in the month of september before the pullback. if you look at the market, sentiment is a bit fragile due to external news, areca capital bhd chief executive officer danny wong told the edge financial daily. according to him, geopolitical risks have been on the minds of most investors, especially with the escalated rhetoric between the us and north korea recently. the possibility of a war spooked investors after pyongyangs foreign minister, ri yong-ho, accused the us of declaring war against the nation following trumps tweet that north korea wont be around much longer. the retail market continues to remain very fragile on concerns of war and the 10-year stock market cycle. but if you look at the market, local institutions continue to be net buyers and while foreign institutions have turned net sellers recently, they remain net buyers throughout the year, said wong. he believes the fundamentals of malaysias economy would take priority for investors eventually and next quarters earnings results should be the catalyst that the market is waiting for. fundsupermart.com research analyst jerry lee concurs, noting that there is a disconnect between the economic data and the stock market performance, which could be due to geopolitical market risks. however, if we analyse it from the fundamental angle, we believe that the local equity market is likely to trend higher moving forward with the expectation of improving corporate earnings, he said. lee also pointed to the malaysian institute of economic research, which revealed that both the consumer sentiment and business confidence indices strengthened to a two-year high of 80.7 and 114.1 points respectively. he said the increase in both indices suggests that local consumers and business owners are turning positive on the local economic outlook for the next three to six months.  what to look out for in 4q in terms of investment themes, cimb said investors are most keen on permodalan nasional bhds transformation, tourism, the 14th general election (ge14) and the progress of the mid and small cap research schemes. cimb also cited the timing of the general election as one of the key questions that investors are looking for. while the parliament will automatically be dissolved only in june next year, ge14 may be held as early as in the final quarter of this year, said midf research. if the ge14 were to be held in 4q17 (fourth quarter of 2017) and the outcome favours the federal incumbent, we can expect another post-election rally, it noted. moving into the last quarter of the year, areca capitals wong said it is important to look at companies that have the capacity to grow their business. expansion to grow will be one of the key factors that we will look at in companies. as for sector, we prefer companies that are export-oriented. we also like some of the commodity-related companies, especially the oil and gas (o&g) players as brent crude oil has stabilised at a healthy level, he said. among some of the sectors favoured by midf research include automotive, aviation, banking, construction, healthcare, insurance/takaful, o&g, power, property and technology. rakuten trade sdn bhd research vice-president vincent lau, who is of the view that the recent dip in the equity market provides an opportunity to buy, is bullish on o&g stocks, as well as the semiconductor sector, mainly due to the new launches of smartphones in the third quarter of 2017, such as apples iphone 8 and iphone 8+, nokia 8 and samsung note 8. another fund manager with a local asset management said the semiconductor has seen worldwide sales grow strongly, with the latest data in july this year showing a 24% year-on-year surge to us$33.6 billion (rm141.79 billion). if you look at the semiconductor sales globally, it has been growing on a year-on-year basis for the past one year, he added. the world semiconductor trade statistics is forecasting global semiconductor sales to hit us$396.6 billion for 2017, indicating that the average monthly sales for the remainder of the year to be about us$35 billion. inter-pacific securities analyst brian yeoh shared with the edge financial daily that the philadelphia semiconductor index has been sliding down all

wave of investor interest in the worlds second largest economy. fund managers share their views on the opportunities and the pitfalls. the continued liberalisation of chinas financial markets has attracted keen interest from global investors, who are taking a closer look at the viability of investments in the country as well as the prospects of chinese companies that are listed on foreign bourses. the recent inclusion of china a-shares in the msci emerging markets index and the launch of the bond connect scheme by china and hong kong have also sparked positive sentiment around the globe. while the a-shares will only have about 1% weightage on the index, the inclusion is largely seen as a symbolic move by msci. nevertheless, this is expected to see a lot more inflows into china. sat duhra, manager of the janus henderson asian dividend income fund, is of the view that china will further liberalise its financial markets. you look at how china has been opening up its capital accounts [including financial markets] over the past 10 years. it is a pretty good move, he says. think about where its economy was 10 years ago and compare that to what you see today. you can imagine that in the next 10 years, it will be a very open place for businesses. it will be the kind of place investors want to get into. the liberalisation of the chinese financial markets is a macroeconomic theme that many fund managers are riding on. it has sparked a lot of interest among local investors as well. the inclusion of china a-shares in the msci emerging markets index has boosted overall market sentiment and will bring in new and long-term international capital into the market, says lei jing, managing director and chief investment officer for fixed income at beijing-based harvest fund management. besides opening up its equity markets, china recently launched its bond connect scheme linking overseas investors to the countrys us$9 trillion bond market. patrick chang, chief investment officer at cimb-principal asset management bhd, believes it is a good move and china is on the right path. however, the interest has not fully translated into action among investors, he says. the inclusion of china a-shares into the msci sparked huge interest among local investors. when i speak to investors, for the first time, there is a lot of appetite for china. there has been a very big shift in their mindset over the last 12 months. they want to diversify away from malaysian equities into asia-pacific. they want to focus on large markets with huge growth. however, there is still a wall of concern among some of them [that is preventing them from investing in the market]. this comes as no surprise as investors have many concerns. for instance, chinas stock markets have the highest number of trading suspensions in the world. in fact, only a month after approving the inclusion of china a-shares on its index, msci warned the country for having too many stock trading suspensions. the index provider, quoting data from shanghai-based consulting firm z-ben advisors, said an average of 265 stocks  or one out of every 13 counters  listed in china were suspended in july. the data also showed that the number had risen every month this year and was up by 30% from an average of 202 stocks in january. corporate governance is another concern for local investors. the malaysian experience of investing in locally listed china companies have not been encouraging. just last month, the edge published a report that showed most of the red chips (china-based companies listed on the local bourse) had corporate governance issues such as late submission of financial reports and inaccuracies in their financial statements. from a macroeconomic perspective, investors are worried about chinas high corporate debt and trillion-dollar shadow banking industry that fuels high financial leverage.  key reason investors should look at china: growth despite the risks, fund managers note that there are compelling reasons for investors to invest in china. growth is one of them. last year, the gross domestic product of the worlds second largest economy stood at us$11.2 trillion, having grown at a rate of 6.7%. by comparison, the us recorded a gdp of us$18.57 trillion while its economy grew 1.6%. much of the growth is happening in chinas technology sector. this can be seen in the performance of players such as tencent holdings ltd and alibaba group holding ltd. just a few years ago, the tech sector had a weightage of less than 15% in msci china. today, it has shot up to 35%, says chang. the economic composition of china is changing. and the key reason why people are excited about the country is because they want to have exposure to its tech companies, which are expected to experience high growth, he adds. the valuations of these tech companies are high, but their growth potential is enormous as they are diversifying into other sectors. this could justify the high price-earnings ratio of the tech giants. for instance, tencent  one of the core holdings of the cimb-principal greater china equity fund  started out as an internet-based company. it is now diversifying into other businesses such as online gaming, e-wallets and payments. it is one of the largest money managers in the world  and this is happening in a world where growth is scarce, says chang. then investors may ask about the high valuations. for now, the valuations of the tech companies are alright as the companies are producing earnings and their cash flow is strong. tourism is another sector in china that he is looking at. ctrip  an online portal that provides travel services such as accommodation reservations, transport ticketing, packaged tours and corporate travel  is one of the bellwether stocks in cimbs funds. chang calls the company the tripadvisor of china. the reason for the growth of this sector is the rising wealth of chinas citizens as well as its expanding middle class. travelling has become part of their life style. there are about 150 million outbound tourists leaving china every year. imagine the growth potential, says chang. also, the chinese are fast adopters of e-commerce and online payments. this benefitted online portals such as ctrip. both tencent and ctrip are h-shares, or the stocks of china-based companies that are listed on the hong kong stock exchange. china companies can offer investors in other parts of asia some unique investment opportunities. there are companies operating in emerging industries such as financial technology (fintech), dna sequencing and new energy vehicles. china has developed these industries into globally recognised ones while other industries have been growing rapidly, says harvest fund managements lei. in the case of fintech, there are a number of up-and-coming players trying to make their mark on various industries. one of them is ant financial, the payment affiliate of alibaba, which runs the alipay mobile payment services. the company, valued at us$60 billion in april last year and more than double that ascribed to snap, is planning to be listed on the hong kong stock exchange. however, it was reported that the listing plan had to be delayed to 2018 as the company needed to secure regulatory approval and focus on building its business. according to a recent bloomberg report, ant financial almost doubled its earnings in financial year 2017 as it expanded its wealth management business overseas. the report pointed out that the company had racked up a pre-tax profit of us$814 million. in the dna sequencing industry, bgi genomics ltd  one of the leading research companies in the genomics industry and the worlds largest genomics organisation (according to its website)  made its debut on the shenzhen stock exchange in july, raising us$250 million in its initial public offering. founded in 1999, the company generates most of its income from fertilisation and health, basic research, complex disease and drugs research services. prior to listing on the shenzhen stock exchange, it failed in its attempt to get listed in the us and hong kong. for new energy vehicles, yutong bus is a good example, says duhra, who is with janus henderson investors. if you are in singapore, you can see their buses. the company is growing internationally and it has a real edge in new energy vehicles. this is a unique business in china. if you compare it to the us, it can be like tesla.  chinas economy better than critics expected looking at the performance of the chinese economy over the past 10 years, fund managers are of the view that it is on the right path. the economy has been growing consistently and the markets have gradually opened up. also, china has successfully avoided a hard landing as expected by its critics in the past two years. the countrys foreign reserves have stabilised and the economy continues to grow at a healthy pace of more than 6% each quarter. on top of that, beijing has started to clamp down on excess credit and shadow banking activities. duhra is of the view that china has shown it is doing better than critics have expected in recent years. a few years ago, when its foreign reserves fell to below us$3 trillion [for the first time in six years] and its property market went down by about 10%, some were saying that china would have a hard landing. but what happened recently was its foreign reserves stabilised and the economy continues to grow. the government is starting to clamp down on excessive credit and off-balance-sheet debt, he says. on the other hand, the level of innovation in the country remains high amid the government clampdown and consumer consumption and manufacturing production are still at healthy levels. amid all these, you see that the increase in the number of patents in china is very impressive. the retail sales numbers are high, as are the production numbers. china is in a very good place. you cant ignore these and say, i dont want to invest in china, says duhra. cimb-principals chang is also positive on the chinese economy and stock markets, judging by their recent performance. we have gone through a lot of noise saying that chinas growth has been going down, especially during the devaluation of the renminbi. but as you can see, year to date, msci china is up by more than 25%. the growth is slowing, but steady, he says. we have also seen earnings upgrades and the government reforming state-owned enterprises. the government is also cutting down on excessive credit, which has caused some companies to go bankrupt. chang believes that when markets are sceptical about china, it represents a good buying opportunity for investors to engage in relatively contrarian trades. this is what cimb-principal did two years ago. chang says he and his team bought some a-shares when the markets plunged due to the renminbi devaluation a few years ago. the team reaped a return when the markets recovered. as i said, everybody has a wall of concern about china. but looking at the country today, its economy is quite stable. i am still very bullish on china. gary lim, regional fund manager at apex investment services bhd, has a positive view on chinas economic growth and the liberalisation of its financial markets, at least in the shorter term. china is making structural improvements for the better and the markets are increasingly allowing investors to get exposure to attractive sectors in the country. lim says chinas further integration into the global economy is expected to benefit global growth. china has a rapid accumulation of domestic savings. this capital, when permitted to flow overseas by the chinese government, could sustain global economic recovery even as the us appears to be on an extended and mature stage of recovery. the one belt, one road initiative is one such government-led initiative. we can debate about the rationales, motive and costs. but really, the capital-starved emerging economies must benefit in the short term from much-needed investments before we even think about the long-term implications whatever they may be.  beware of the value trap investors who are interested in investing in china should avoid falling into the value trap, says sat duhra, manager of the janus henderson asian dividend income fund. this means buying companies that look attractive based on their cheap valuations. in fact, the companies performance and share price tend to remain flat over the years. duhra says chinese companies are typically state-owned enterprises across various sectors, including banking, industrial and property. it is very easy to fall into the trap because these companies are constantly cheap and relatively attractive. you tend to think of buying into them and hope there might be an inflection point where things happen and the share prices rally. but if you look at the past five years, the share prices have been volatile and they have not rallied much. in fact, they always stay cheap and that is the trap no one wants to fall into. instead, he suggests that investors pay a premium to buy into well-run private companies that are profitable and have no debt. he advises investors to look at the companies financial statements and talk to their management to see if they are experiencing structural growth. it is better to pay a little more to buy into good companies in fast-growing sectors such as personal computer gaming and sport brands, he says. as a dividend income fund manager, duhra suggests that investors focus more on the companies cash flow and dividend payout instead of their price-earnings ratio as it is not a good reference point for investors in asia. the pers highly depend on the accounting standards adopted by the particular country. also, corporate governance is an issue in some emerging markets. instead, you need to look at what kind of growth the companies have with the investments they make. more importantly, what is the cash flow they are producing? are their operations strong? what are their actual returns like after deducting the cost of capital? if you dont look at companies in asia this way, you will get burnt, says duhra. with good cash flow, these companies are more likely to pay attractive dividends, which could provide investors more confidence after realising their gains, he says. a consistent dividend payout also shows that a company holds enough cash and cares about the interests of its shareholders. this could reduce the possibility of any manipulation to its financial statements.  china play in the malaysian market malaysia is chinas largest trading partner in southeast asia and the recipient of large-scale investments worth up to rm400 billion in local port and railway projects. investors can ride the china theme by investing in companies with ties to these projects as well as chinese companies listed on the local bourse. patrick chang, chief investment officer at cimb-principal asset management, says the one belt, one road initiative is an obvious play for investors to tap. this includes construction companies that will benefit from mega infrastructure projects that are being kicked off on the back of chinese investments. according to a fundsupermart.com report, titled idea of the week: the belt and road initiatives saga  malaysias stake, the mega projects include the lrt3 project, which will see the involvement of beijing-based rolling stock manufacturer crrc corp ltd. the project, which is now worth rm1.56 billion, will see three more packages worth rm2.5 billion kick in by the end of this month and funds have been exclusively allocated to malaysian companies, says the report. another project is the rm55 billion east coast rail link, funded by china communications construction co ltd and export-import bank of china. it is the largest railway project undertaken by the private sector in malaysia. the ecrl will connect wakaf baru in kelantan to the integrated transport terminal in gombak and port klang, selangor. chang says the tourism theme is another direct play. oldtown bhd and malaysia airports holdings bhd (mahb) are two examples of such companies. about 40% of oldtowns revenue comes from product sales to chinese tourists. i know many who visit relatives in china [often] bring oldtown white coffee with them. mahb is another example. if you look at the companys statistics, the number of tourists has increased. also, i go to malaysian airports all the time and there are often long queues. chang says the growth of the tourism industry is expected to continue in the next few years. as mentioned, there are 150 million outbound tourists leaving china every year. this is expected to increase to 200 million by 2020. the weakening ringgit and evisa  chinas online electronic visa programme  have helped boost tourist numbers, he adds.  a sceptics view while many investment experts are bullish on the chinese economy, some are not. john d kuhn, author of china fortunes: a tale of business in the new world, is one of the sceptics. kuhn, who first visited china in 1984 and invested about us$1 billion in private equity there in 2006, has not invested in chinese publicly-traded securities since. and he has no plans to do so as the level of governance and disclosure required of listed companies there is wholly inadequate. while a reading of chinas rules on disclosure shows that it employs standards similar to those adopted by securities commissions, stock exchanges and accounting associations around the world, the practice of disclosure there is totally different. why? because there is no accountability or penalties [imposed on those who break the rules], says kuhn. for example, if general motors did not voluntarily disclose in its public filings that, say, warren buffett had through various means accumulated 10% of the companys stock, the people responsible would be prosecuted. and if they were found guilty, they would serve a significant jail term. nothing like that exists in china. it is just a different world and the people who pay the price are the common shareholders. kuhn says the same logic applies to the countrys legal system. the court is another example of the same phenomenon. back in the 1970s after chairman mao died and china was coming out [to the world], various foreign experts worked with the country to implement a legal code and court system similar to those of first-tier economies. and the result is that the chinese court system appears to be  on the surface  very similar to the functioning legal system in, say, the us or europe. but if you try participating in it, it is not even worth a serious discussion. also, he does not believe that the inclusion of china a-shares in the msci emerging markets index will enhance the level of corporate governance in the country. i dont think it will improve its markets transparency and corporate governance. i am not sure what will change the way china handles these things  maybe if something like what happened in japan, where the market dropped precipitously and has never bounced back, [occurs in china as well]. kuhns views are based on his first-hand experience as a private equity investor in china. a typical portfolio manager, as diligent as he may be, usually sits at his desk in comfortable places like hong kong or singapore. at best, he pays periodic visits to a company whose securities the firm owns. even what that happens, the company can control what he sees and hears when he visits, he says. on the other hand, when you are a direct private equity investor, you experience first-hand the pathetic inadequacy of these systems. that is what makes a private equity investors hair curl and causes one to realise how different china is from other investment milieus. everyone is entitled to their own opinion. however, i wonder how many of them have dealt with chinese warlords who, on a day-to-day basis, demand huge sums of money from various ill-gotten gains. kuhn is also of the view that while chinas economy will continue to grow, it is living on borrowed time due to years of questionable practices and non-accountable borrowings. the chinese economy is just beginning to show cracks in the fau00e7ade from years of corruption and rampant non-accountable borrowing. for evidence of the coming catastrophe, one only needs to look at dalian wanda group. the same kind of behaviour was rampant in japan in the late 1980s. this, together with its demographics situation, is one of the key reasons why its economy has not recovered since."}, "68": {"date_posted": "15/9/2017", "title": "north korean missile rattles markets again", "article": " kuala lumpur

hosted by bioalpha managing director wiliam hon and his senior management team. so far, 124 acres (50.12ha) of the 1,004 acre park have been cleared and the remaining 880 acres are due to be cleared by end-2018. the planned capital expenditure is rm5 million over 18 months. we expect marginal revenue from the pasir raja herbal park this year but it could be significant from 2020. we have not assumed any potential earnings from it yet. the pasir raja herbal park is about a two-hour drive from the kuala terengganu sultan mahmud airport. the company also has another 295 acres of herbal park in kota tinggi, johor. in 2014, bioalpha was appointed by the east coast economic region development council (ecerdc) as the anchor company to develop the pasir raja herbal park land into an integrated herbal cluster and manage it. bioalpha expects the park to help the company source its own herbs and improve its quality control. the 124-acre tract that had been cleared has been planted with various herbs and fruit trees such as the kacip fatimah, tongkat ali, roselle, ginger, lemongrass, papaya, coconut and black pepper. while it may only take a year for a papaya tree to mature, it takes five to seven years for coconut trees and tongkat ali plants to do so. we estimate the current average selling price of raw materials from the park is around rm3 per kg and we expect it to gradually rise as the plantation matures over the next few years. bioalpha is targeting a production of only 200 tonnes of raw materials from the park this year. assuming the average selling price is rm3 per kg, we estimate revenue from the park this year would be only about rm600,000 and a profit before tax (pbt) of rm300,000 (assuming a 50% pbt margin). however, by 2020, production from the park could rise to 2,000 tonnes per annum and assuming the average selling price is rm3 per kg, we project a revenue of rm6 million and pbt of rm3 million (assuming a 50% pbt margin). we have not assumed any earnings from the park in our earnings forecasts. bioalpha currently sources its tongkat ali root from the orang asli, who collect the root from the jungles. we estimate bioalpha would start sourcing its tongkat ali root internally from 2020. we understand there could soon be an industry shortage of tongkat ali as distributors from china have been purchasing it in large quantities over the past few years. this could be positive for herbal planters like bioalpha in the long-term. we maintain our earnings per share forecasts and tp of rm0.37, based on 20 times financial year 2018 price-earnings ratio (per) at a 20% discount to our 25 times calender year 2018 target per for the consumer sector. the discount reflects bioalphas small market capitalisation. the stock remains an add call and potential catalysts include stronger-than-expected sales from china and india, its two main export markets. a downside risk is weak domestic sales.  cimb research, sept 10"}, "73":

rates or providing other forms of incentives, due to the higher loan-to-deposit (ld) ratio of banks, says sunway university economics professor dr yeah kim leng. \"with the ld ratio hovering at the 90% level, banks are likely to intensify their campaigns to boost fixed and savings deposits,\" he points out. yeah says the competitiveness will be determined by the demand for loans, where strong growth will require banks to push for higher deposits or seek out more expensive funding via the debt capital markets. \"there will be more volatility as the debt capital markets are tied to the prevailing financial conditions,\" he adds. yeah says banks could also \"reduce lending to maintain the appropriate ld ratio, albeit at the expense of missed opportunities in terms of higher business volume and profit\". his comments come on the back of reports that malayan banking bhd (maybank) had the highest ld ratio in the local banking sector (99.2%) as at march while the banking sector as a whole was contending with slower deposit growth against loan expansion. in the report, a cimb analyst noted that the local banking sector's ld ratio had risen from 76.2% in february 2012 to 90.4% in june this year. however, he added that more indicators needed to be taken into consideration to come up with a more realistic assessment of liquidity. \"indicators such as loan-to-fund ratio and capital have increasingly become more reflective of the lending capacity of banks as they take into consideration the other sources of funding that can be tapped by the banks,\" he says. according to the analyst, one of the key reasons for the lagging ld ratio is the prevailing low interest rates which have caused depositors to shift to higher-yielding vehicles or assets, such as unit trusts and stock investments. \"a second reason is the decline in household savings due to weak wage and income growth. third, a rise in the cost of living has resulted in squeezed savings for households and this has affected deposits,\" says yeah."}, "75": {"date_posted": "7/9/2017", "title": "olympia surges 17.24% on disposal of stake in jupiter to cimb ", "article": " kuala lumpur (sept 7): olympia

20.4% of the companies listed on bursa malaysia as at march 31, 2017  the membership cut-off date. they collectively commanded a market capitalisation of rm1.59 trillion, or 90.3% of the entire market value as at that day, up 5.2% from rm1.51 trillion last year, after falling for two consecutive years. the gain in the collective value of the brc companies  those with a market capitalisation of at least rm1 billion as at end-march  happened even as the fbm klci regained ground and closed above 1,700 points again in march. before that, the ringgits decline to levels last seen during the 1998 asian financial crisis and the market volatility following the outflow of foreign funds from emerging markets after the us presidential election, nudged the fbm klci 3% lower year on year in 2016 to 1,641.73 points. it marked a third straight year of decline after skidding 3.9% in 2015 and 5.7% in 2014. before that, the local benchmark had risen for five consecutive years, from 876.75 points at end-2008 to 1,866.96 points by end-2013. by june 30 this year, the 184 brc members combined market capitalisation had increased further (from end-march) to rm1.61 trillion, led by gains at malayan banking bhd and cimb group holdings bhd, which each gained more than rm10 billion in market cap in the second quarter. in june this year, maybank became the first malaysia-listed company with a market cap of more than rm100 billion. the significant change in stock prices between end-march and end-june is why the edge decided to change the cut-off date in tabulating total returns to shareholders from end-march to end-june, closer to the brc gala dinner and awards. the membership cut-off date was kept at end-march to give enough time to compile data for tabulation as well as for the panel of corporate responsibility (cr) judges to review the companies. because of this, two large ipos did not make it to our list this year: eco world international bhd, which listed on april 3, and lotte chemical titan holdings bhd, listed on july 11. they will only be included for membership next year. the 184 brc 2017 members continue to be major taxpayers, paying an estimated rm30.9 billion in taxes in fy2016 compared with rm29.8 billion in fy2015 and rm30.7 billion in fy2014. the taxes paid for fy2016 made up about 27% of the more than rm114 billion in direct taxes the inland revenue board reportedly collected last year. the irb collected rm116.8 billion in direct taxes in 2015, rm127 billion in 2014 and rm121 billion in 2013. the taxman reportedly aims to collect rm127 billion in direct taxes this year. the higher combined tax haul came even as the combined revenue of the 184 brc 2017 members reached rm747.1 billion in fy2016, up 2.8% from rm726.8 billion in the previous financial year. nonetheless, the bottom line was lower, with brc members posting a collective pre-tax profit of rm112.5 billion in fy2016 compared with rm115.3 billion in fy2015. collective net profit was rm81.6 billion in fy2016 compared with rm85.4 billion in fy2015, rm87.8 billion in fy2014 and rm85.5 billion in fy2013. collective fy2016 earnings were weighed down by sizeable losses at several oil and gas as well as industrial and services companies, including umw oil & gas corp bhd, umw holdings bhd, bumi armada bhd and drb-hicom bhd. a quick sectoral analysis of this years 184 brc members reveals that the collectively higher turnover was lifted by significant gains in the plantation sector. all other sectors also gained in terms of top line, except for consumer products. planters also led gains in terms of pre-tax and net profits for fy2016. the fy2016 net profit of the nine super big cap companies  those with a market capitalisation of at least rm40 billion  were largely unchanged

membership and winners of the edge brc corporate awards is provided by asia analytica data sdn bhd (formerly known as the edge markets sdn bhd) and data extracted from bloomberg. members eligible for

evaluation period is between fy2013 and fy2016. calculation for pat growth is also subject to a risk-weight factor component to recognise the importance of consistency in profit delivery throughout the evaluation period. winners for the edge brc highest returns to shareholders award are judged purely based on total return, consisting of share price gains and dividends over a three-year period. this year, the cut-off date is changed from march 31 to june 30 so that the market data is closer to the brc gala dinner. the june 30 cut-off date will be maintained going forward, with this year being the gap year when the data is for three years and three months (march 31, 2014, to june 30, 2017). the annual end-march cut-off date for brc membership is unchanged due to the need to source cr information for the judges consideration. companies with scores within 0.5point of each other are deemed to be of the same rank in determining the recipients of both gold and silver awards. there could, therefore, be cases of joint recipients for gold and silver awards.  the edge brc best cr initiatives award eligible companies are evaluated by a panel of judges on their cr initiatives. the edge brc best cr initiatives award is presented to companies with the top average scores in three categories: the super big cap category (companies with over rm40 billion in market capitalisation), the big cap category (companies with rm10 billion to rm40 billion in market capitalisation) and companies with less than rm10 billion market capitalisation. the panel is selected by the edge and the evaluation criteria are based on the three focal areas spelt out by bursa malaysias sustainability reporting guide for public listed companies  economic, social and environmental. cr scores account for 30% of the evaluation for the edge brc company of the year award. the edge brc company of the year award  value creator: outstanding ceo of malaysia the winner(s) of this award is determined by the edge based on an assessment of the persons contribution to value creation for his/her company. here, value creation is reflected in the companys market valuation, return to shareholders and stakeholders, revenue and profit growth as well as employment creation. to be chosen, the ceo must have achieved outstanding success in all these areas. assessment starts from when the person became ceo of the company. the edge has absolute discretion in deciding on this exclusive award and can choose not to name a winner  as was the case in 2011 and 2015. in 2010, the award went to tan sri teh

will there be a merger with another banking group? recall that some four months after ammbs azman, 78, announced his impending departure in january, the group entered into merger talks with rival rhb bank bhd. azman has a 12.97% interest in ammb and, like teh, has no family member who is keen on taking over the business. i really wouldnt speculate to that extent. of course, one cant entirely discount the possibility of a merger, but you must remember, it wont be cheap for any bank looking at public bank. its trading at 2.3 times price to book ... a lot of the mergers these days are done by an exchange of shares. of the two banks that are larger than public bank, cimb group holdings bhd is trading at 1.5 times price to book, while malayan banking bhds (maybank) is at 1.3 times ... so it would be difficult. i dont see a merger happening in the next 12 months, a banking analyst tells the edge. teh has a total equity interest of 23.54% (908.9 million shares) in public bank, held directly and through consolidated teh holdings sdn bhd. the stake was valued at rm18.9 billion based on last fridays market close of rm20.76 per share. public bank, long admired by its rivals, is the benchmark setter in the industry on important metrics like asset quality, return on equity and cost management  a testament to tehs prudent and conservative management from way back. it has top market shares in retail banking, and has a solid small and medium enterprise client base. the whole point about public bank is that its a nice bank to have and im sure other banks covet it, but its so expensive, another analyst says. public bank itself has given no indication that it plans to deviate from its longtime strategy of organic growth. of the merger scenarios that have been bandied about by analysts in the past, public bank is seen to fit better with cimb than maybank. maybank would of course be able to digest a bank the size of public bank, that wouldnt be an issue. but, the concern is more about customer attrition. public bank has a strong chinese customer base that may switch to hong leong bank. there would be no point in maybank paying a premium for public bank if it runs the risk of customer attrition. the bank is seen as a better fit with cimb because cimb is weak on the sme side ... it is building from a very low base versus maybank, which has a bigger sme profile, the first analyst says. analysts doubt teh will sell his shares anytime soon. i think the one difference between him and the the other prominent banker, hong leongs quek, is that the latter has so many other businesses. if the price was right, he would sell the bank and move on. but teh is a thoroughbred banker. apart from lonpac [insurance bhd], which is also finance-related, banking is his main focus. its his baby and it keeps him going, so hell probably hang on to it, one analyst says. teh will also retire as chairman in public islamic bank bhd and public investment bank bhd, on jan 1 next year, but will stay on as non-executive director.

analysts maintained their outlook for the glove makers earnings. one analyst, who did not wish to be named, said the outlook for the entire sector remains robust. but the earnings of the other glove makers cannot be correlated with hartalega, which might have seen some distortion from a favourable exchange rate, she said. hartalega, which announced a 72% increase in net profit to rm96.39 million for the first quarter ended june 30, 2017 on tuesday, saw its stock finish as the fifth-biggest decliner on bursa malaysia yesterday. it was down 22 sen or 3.08% to rm6.93, with some 2.17 million

corp bhd, however, bucked the trend, rising two sen to close at rm5.72, with a trading volume of 1.76 million shares. we think that the selldown in the rubber glove counters [yesterday] was attributable to profit-taking as the prices of the glove counters in general have been on an uptrend for the past two weeks, said midf amanah investment bank bhd research (midf research) analyst noor athila razali. noor athila said second-quarter earnings estimates for the other glove makers are expected to be met due to a stable us dollar-to-ringgit exchange rate throughout the quarter, as well as a recovery in raw material prices. price competition has also abated, which allows for better pricing of glove products which in turn would result in an improved revenue, she told the edge financial daily. out of 20 analysts covering hartalega, 15 have a hold call on the counter, with a trailing 12-month target price (tp) of rm6.77 for 19 of the analysts, according to bloomberg data. both cimb investment bank research and midf research kept their hold and neutral calls on hartalega yesterday, with unchanged tps of rm7.06 and rm6.99 respectively. although we like the groups long-term prospects and leading position in the sector, we believe that current valuations have priced in these factors, cimb said in a report on the company. midf research said hartalegas valuation, which remains lofty at 26.6 times its financial year 2017 (fy17) price-earnings ratio compared with an average of 19 times for its peers, remains unattractive. furthermore, its share price surpassed our target price last week, which further limits share price appreciation in our opinion, midf research said in a research report yesterday. hartalegas share price appreciated some 50% from rm4.92 on may 2, to its all-time high of rm7.38 on july 3. separately, jf apex securities and publicinvest research raised their tps on the stock to rm7.27 from rm5.79, and rm6.88 from rm5.30 respectively. publicinvest said its upward revision was based on the groups better efficiencies that are expected to cushion higher costs to be reflected from fy22. however, it also believes the groups expansion capacities are fully priced in at this juncture, thus limiting its share price upside. kenanga research, the only research house to maintain its outperform view on the stock, said in its report

operations to account for over 30% of the groups profit before tax (pbt) this year on the back of improving earnings in indonesia, thailand and singapore, its group ceo tengku datuk seri zafrul aziz says. it would be the first time in four years that the overseas contribution to group pbt exceeded 30%. the figure had faltered from 38% in fy2013 to 28% in fy2014, 21% in fy2015 and 22% last year after the group had to make heavy provisions for bad loans at its banks in indonesia and thailand. this year, it will be above 30% for sure, in terms of contribution outside malaysia, because indonesia, thailand and singapore are all showing better results. in the first quarter, theyve shown better results, and for the rest of the year, given that our budget is on target, we should see the malaysian contribution to group earnings going down from more than 70% to more than 60%. so, well see malaysia contributing less, but it doesnt mean that its not growing  it just means that [our businesses in] the other countries are growing faster than in malaysia, zafrul tells the edge. under its t18 (short for target 2018) strategy, which sets out a slew of targets that cimb aspires to achieve by end-fy2018, its international operations are expected to contribute about 35% to group pbt. the asean-focused banking group, which is due to announce its 2q financial results at end-august, is also on track to meet its return on equity target of 9.5%, zafrul adds. analysts concur that the worst of cimbs headwinds in indonesia and thailand are over, and do not foresee any major surprises in the groups 2q results. we expect cimbs asset quality to improve in the quarters ahead. this is as its malaysian loan book remains solid while the inflow of new non-performing loans at its indonesia and thai operations likely peaked in 4q2016, rhb research says in a report right after cimb reported its 1q results in may. meanwhile, cimb is looking to set up a bank branch in the philippines to complete its asean footprint and hopes to secure the philippine central banks approval to do so before year end. zafrul quashes market talk that cimb plans to enter the philippines as a qualified asean bank (qab). in april, bank negara malaysia and its philippine counterpart had inked a bilateral agreement that allows qualified commercial banks to operate subsidiaries in each others markets, sparking speculation of which banks might be applying for qab status. we decided were going to start with a branch first. were not going via the qab route. whether we go through the qab route or through an acquisition route [to grow], that we will [decide] later. but the strategy for now is organic growth, and we will start operations through a branch, he says. weve already made the application to the philippine central bank. in fact, our team went there recently to meet them. but i think we will need time to build the infrastructure, so it could probably be the first quarter of next year, or the second quarter, that we start operations. the group had originally intended to start a branch in manila by year end. industry observers say it makes sense for cimb to start off in the philippines with a bank branch rather than to set up a subsidiary as the latter would require a much heavier capital commitment. as one of the fastest growing economies in asean, the philippines makes for an attractive banking market. but competition is tough and it may take cimb a while before it makes good on its investment there. of its overseas operations, indonesia, singapore and thailand are its biggest contributors to earnings. several years ago, the indonesian operations alone used to account for a third of cimbs pbt. in 1q2017, indonesias pbt contribution rose 135.5% year on year to rm292 million while thailands grew 15.9% to rm102 million. singapores increased by 121% to rm137 million on the back of improved revenues and lower provisions. zafrul thinks cimb would not be hurt by the latest spate of oil and gas casualties in singapore. the oil and gas exposure in singapore is so small, less than 1% of our total loan exposure, so its no issue for us, he says. cimb thai bank pcl, which two weeks ago reported a nearly eight-fold rise in 2q earnings, saw 1h net profit grow 30.1% to thb477.8 million due to better net interest income and lower provisions. midf research says in a july 20 report: the groups thai operations are turning around as evident by this quarters result. we believe that cimb thai will be a positive contributor to the group in fy2017. analysts say investors, who chased the shares 49.3% higher so far this year as at last thursday, have already priced in the recovery in indonesia and thailand. the stock closed at rm6.59 that day. bloomberg data shows that of 25 analysts that track the stock, a majority (14) have a hold call on it, 10 call it a buy, and just one says to sell.

the consensus full-year forecasts. we deem this in line as 4q is usually the weakest quarter of the year due to a lack of seasonal festivities. as expected, no dividend was declared for 3qfy17. f&ns f&b thailand unit experienced a revenue growth of 6.9% y-o-y to rm448.6 million, despite lower sales volumes as a favourable ringgit/thai baht rate and higher export-boosted revenue. however, this was offset by softer showing of its malaysian business that saw revenue drop by 14% y-o-y to rm592.5 million due to lacklustre sales during the hari raya festive season (weak consumer sentiment), compounded by intense pricing competition in the soft drinks segment. its 9mfy17 earnings before interest and tax (ebit) dropped 8.5% y-o-y to rm335.9 million. f&b malaysia saw its 9mfy17 ebit plunge 61.3% y-o-y due to an increase in raw material costs (particularly for sugar) and higher restructuring costs. the groups f&b thailand unit also saw its ebit fall by 2.4% y-o-y to rm52.8 million for 9mfy17, due to higher raw material costs, partly mitigated by cautious and lower trade spending. overall, f&ns 3qfy17 ebit margin declined by 2.2% percentage points y-o-y to 7.9%. exports now make up more than 10% of f&ns total revenue, and the company has identified exports as the groups main sales growth driver for the next few years. f&n targets to lift export sales to rm800 million by calendar year 2020 (cy20), but we think that it could easily achieve the goal before this. one of the key growth drivers of export sales would be f&n leveraging on its halal status to gain orders from the middle east market, which would enable the group to expand its export distribution network. we make no changes to our fy17 to fy19 earnings per share forecasts. we maintain our hold call with an unchanged discounted cash flow-based tp of rm23.20. the stock now trades at 21 times cy18 forecast price-earnings ratio, broadly in line with its historical five-year mean. we think that this is justified, given the groups strong brand name, market leadership position in the domestic ready-to-drink market and good historical earnings track record. key upside/downside risks to our call are significant decreases/increases in key raw material prices.  cimb research, aug 4\n"}, "98": {"date_posted": "7/8/2017", "title": "better corporate earnings seen in second quarter", "article": " kuala lumpur: the road to recovery was the theme during the earnings reporting season for the first quarter of this year (1q17). as the 2q17 earnings season gets underway, investors are moving on to the next theme  that of sustainable revenue and earnings growth. all eyes will be on whether the companies can repeat their performances seen in 1q17. malaysias stock market has regained some ground, with the fbm klci and fbm small cap index earning a total return of 9.9% and 18.3% respectively so far this year. but will the companies 2q17 earnings keep pace with the rally in the local equity market? according to jf apex securities bhd head of research lee chung cheng, companies are likely to report better earnings in 2q17 compared with the year-ago period in line with the better outlook for the year on the back of improved economic activity. however, well have to wait for [malaysian company] earnings to catch up with the stock market valuation. the market wont be cheap, lee told the edge financial daily over the telephone. in a report dated aug 2, maybank investment bank research (maybank ib research) said data points to the country sustaining its growth momentum of 1q17, where gross domestic product (gdp) growth was 5.6%. our economics team forecasts 5.1% real gdp growth in 2017, while the official 2017 real gdp growth forecast of 4.3% to 4.8% could be raised soon, potentially together with the release of 2q17 gdp on aug 18, it added. still, going into 2h17, maybank ib research remains cautiously constructive on malaysian equities, with a slightly neutral bias after 1h17s gains. for malaysian equities, the key positives are the domestic macros which should remain positive throughout 2017 while market/corporate earnings growth looks set to resume. that said, we stay mindful of the prevailing external policy and geopolitical headwinds, amid an extended period of market calm and low volatility for most of 2017 year to date (ytd). volatility, as measured by the chicago board options exchange volatility index, has continued to stay at low levels. volatility has also retreated in the other asset classes with the exception of crude oil, it said. while optimism abounds, mercury securities sdn bhd head of research edmund tham said the market has become more cautious as reflected in its trading volume. if you look at the trading volume, it has gone down quite significantly. at one time, the average daily trading volume was consistently above three billion shares. right now, its only about one billion shares, tham told the edge financial daily. the average daily trading volume on bursa malaysia stood at 2.8 billion shares in 1h17 but it has since tapered off. last friday, trading volume totalled 1.42 billion shares worth rm1.47 billion. meanwhile, tham expects both upside and downside earnings surprises in this reporting season rather than things being good or bad for a specific industry. below are the expectations and views of analysts for the 2q17 earnings season in some of the sectors: construction according to public investment bank bhd research analyst tan siang hing, most of the construction companies under its coverage will continue to see good earnings. they (earnings) will still be good. the earnings visibility of most of them is still good. given the higher order book seen, technically, the earnings will also be higher, he said. while tan conceded that the valuations of construction stocks are not cheap, he said their share prices tend to move in tandem with news flow. if there is news flow to support, the share prices will be able to sustain, he said, pointing to the light rail vehicle work package valued at rm1.56 billion that was awarded to the consortium of crrc zhuzhou locomotive co ltd, siemens ltd china and tegap dinamik sdn bhd recently. in a report dated aug 3, maybank ib research construction analyst adrian wong said there are expectations of major civil packages (viaducts and guideways) to be awarded next, with potential beneficiaries including gamuda bhd, ijm corp bhd, sunway construction group bhd and kimlun corp bhd. ytd, the kuala lumpur construction index has outperformed the benchmark fbm klci index with a total return of 19.8%. semiconductor midf research analyst martin foo chuan loong is optimistic about semiconductor companies financial performance for 2q17. this is supported by the latest export data which showed malaysias exports rising 10% year-on-year to rm73.1 billion in june, as the country sold more electrical and electronics besides palm oil products. take a look at the events that will unfold in this quarter, with apple expected to launch the latest iphone and samsung a new note, and this is just the big players we are talking about. in order for these stocks to be ready, production is required in 2q17. thus, production volume would be ramped up which should lead to better earnings [for semiconductor companies], said foo. he also pointed to the improved global sales data, which should bode well for 2q17. on how a stronger ringgit would affect exporters such as the semiconductor players, foo said most of the players in this space have a natural hedge to the currency. usually, only about 50% of the cost is in us dollars. i dont think the impact from foreign exchange fluctuations will be significant, he added. nevertheless, foo agrees that the valuations of semiconductor stocks are currently on the high side, noting that the share prices have run ahead of earnings season. banking/finance the banking sector is expected to post muted earnings, with 2q17 results expected to be marginally higher from a year ago but would not reflect the strong earnings seen in 1q17, said hong leong investment bank research analyst khairul azizi kairudin. he pointed out that due to the hari raya festive holidays, which resulted in june being a shorter month, leading to lower loan applications, there could be a moderation in bank earnings growth in 2q17 compared with 1q17. on the outlook for the banking sector, we maintain our neutral stance due to modest growth outlook for earnings, loan and deposit growth. the modest earnings growth will result in lower roe (return on equity) and the lower expected return, he said. maybank ib research also has a neutral call on the sector but expects loan growth to pick up pace in 2h17. the pickup in non-household loan growth is encouraging, and we look forward to ongoing expansion in this segment if our industry loan growth estimate of 5.4% for 2017 is to be achieved, against annualised loan growth of 3.5% to date, said maybank ib research banking analyst desmond chng in his report dated aug 2. aviation cimb equities research regional transport analyst raymond yap is confident that airasia bhds 2q17 results will outperform that of 1q17. we believe the higher domestic market share will help improve 2q17 and 2h17 (second half of 2017) yields, helping reverse the yield pressures in malaysia felt during 1q17, he said. we believe load factors rose from 88% in 1q17 to an all-time high of 90% in 2q17. airasias 1q17 results disappointed the market due to the rm140 million to rm150 million one-off moving cost but we think this is unlikely to recur in 2q17. macro factors are also supportive of stronger earnings as the us dollar weakened 2.6% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) to an average of rm4.33 while jet fuel prices fell 4.3% q-o-q, yap said in a report dated july 17. midf research analyst tay yow ken also expects airasia to post better results in 2q17 based on its preliminary operating statistics. the operating statistics showed demand was slightly higher than expected, even though second quarter is traditionally a weak quarter, he said. on the industry outlook, tay is positive about both airasia and malaysia airports holdings bhd in 2h17, pointing to more sporting events as well as the easing of visa applications, which would lead to higher tourist arrival in the country. media the outlook for the media industry, meanwhile, remains challenging. although we see improvements in the macro environment, we have yet to see a substantial recovery in the media sector, largely because companies still remain cautious and adopt a wait-and-see approach to adex (advertising expenditure) spending, a media analyst who declined to be named said. in addition, media companies also face the gradual but long-term structural shift in consumer preference towards mostly free online content. although media and telecommunications players are trying to adapt and change by digitalising their business models, its not easy to monetise digital content in this information-exploding era. in malaysian newsprint industries sdn bhds (mni) case, its [liquidation] was mainly because of the cheap imports that rendered the local manufacturing firm with higher production costs uncompetitive, he said. last week, hong leong industries bhd and media prima bhd announced that mni had initiated creditors voluntary winding up proceedings amid declining newsprint demand and three straight years of losses. kenanga research analyst cheow ming liang also shared the same sentiment in his report dated july 20. he said while the countrys 2017 adex sentiment is set to be supported by several major events such as the [emailprotected]: golden celebration campaign, 29th southeast asian games, ninth asean para games, and a potential 14th general election, these feel-good factors are likely to be offset by a weak ringgit against the us dollar and the rising cost of doing business."}, "99":

positive on the stock, however, maintaining \"buy\", with a target price of rm7.10. \"we believe cimb's share price would continue to outperform peers as the stock remains a good proxy to the

in malaysia is tracking well with healthy demand for housing loans and a pick-up in corporate lending. prospects in indonesia, however, are clouded by the slower-than-expected rebound in economic activities. in thailand, management is not pushing for loan growth,\" said rhb research. on net interest margins (nim), cimb niaga's strong nim in 1hfy17 due to higher casa ratio and active management of liabilities shows there is a potential for the group's nim to turn out better than its guided compression of 5 to 10 basis points,\" said aminvestment research. \"domestically, we gather that

potential shortfall in loan growth, we are maintaining our forecast net profit of rm4,451 million (core: +30% yoy). this means the bank is on track to achieving its roe target of 9.5%,\" said rhb

darbys disposal of its 40% stake in seriamas development sdn bhd (sdsb) to permodalan nasional bhd yesterday for rm625 million cash, despite the lack of details surrounding the transaction. sime darby told bursa malaysia yesterday that it expected to record a gain on disposal (after non-controlling interests) of approximately rm305 million. the conglomerate said its original cost of investment in sdsb is rm449 million and that proceeds from the disposal will mainly be used for general corporate purposes and working capital, including repayment of borrowings. sime darby said the disposal consideration represents a discount of 39.4% to the realisable net asset value (rnav) of sdsb of rm1.23 million as at march 31, 2017. publicinvest research said in a note today that it had no details on the specific location and balance of landbank size held after the disposal, making details of the transaction still unclear. as details of the transaction remain sketchy, it is relatively difficult to give our view on this deal, publicinvest research said. however, it maintained its outperform call on the stock, with an unchanged target price of rm9.72. rhb research institute sdn bhd however said in its note today that it considers the valuation for the transaction to be relatively inexpensive, but the value-unlocking for the deal is progressing. assuming the hotels and malls have zero value (given location and size), we estimate that sime is disposing its stake in sdsb for around rm4.48 per square foot (psf). this is in comparison to recent land transactions in selangor that were closer to rm5psf, it said. nevertheless, we would consider this disposal as a positive development. this is due to the fact that simes landbank held under associates is not even included in our rnav calculation for simes property assets of rm20.3billion. as such, any disposal of such landbank would be additional value unlocking for the company, it added. sime darby said the disposal in sdsb is expected to be completed by year end, which is also when the group expects to list its property and plantation arms. rhb however said the market should wait for more details on the upcoming listing structure of its property arm sime darby property bhd. although simes share price has already risen by more than 20% from its low, we believe the market should wait for more news on the upcoming listing structure and earnings growth drivers in the interim period, rhb said. meanwhile, cimb ib research said in a flash note yesterday that it is positive on the news and believes the transaction price is fair, as the implied discount of the implied equity value to rnav is in line with precedent transactions of malaysian property companies over the past three years, which range from 26.1% to 45.9%. the research house said simes original cost of investment in sdsb was rm449 million. we are positive on this news, as we expect sime to record a gain on disposal of rm305 million from the disposal, after netting off non-controlling interests and cost of disposal, cimb ib research said. we expect the gain to be recognised in fy16/18, and this could bump up simes net profit by 13% or earnigns per share (eps) by 4.48 sen per share. we have not incorporated this into our earnings forecasts, pending the completion of the deal, it added. at 11.34am, simes counter rose 0.43% or four

banks 2h17", "article": " kuala lumpur (july 26): analysts have maintained their \"hold\" ratings on public bank bhds (pbb) stock price, citing pricey valuations and a tough outlook ahead, following the banks release of its second quarter results yesterday. in spite of its strong fundamentals, we rate pbb as a hold, in view of its rich valuations. its fy18 p/e of 12.7x and p/bv of 1.9x are among the highest in the sector, while its fy17f dividend yield of 3.5% is below the sectors average of about 4%, cimb research said. meanwhile, hlib research also maintained hold, but raised its target price to rm20.80, as it rolled over its valuation to fy18. cimb noted public banks loan growth had eased from 7% year-on-year (y-o-y) in march 2017 to 5.3% y-o-y in june 2017, being the weakest since 2003, mainly dragged down by a slow down in property loan expansion. as such, pbb had revised its loan growth target to 4%-5% in 2017, citing external environments. hlib research noted this as the bank painted a tougher outlook for its second half. as for pbbs results, the research houses opined it was in line with expectations. public bank bhd (pbb) posted its second-quarter (2q) results yesterday, which saw its net profit rise 6% from a year ago to rm1.33 billion, boosted mainly by higher net interest income, lower loan impairment allowance and higher net fee and commission income. there was no major surprise on pbbs 1h17 results, as net profit of rm2.57 billion came in within expectations, accounting for 48.5% and 49% of hlib and consensus, hlib said. cimb research also echoed the same, adding 2h is expected to perform better. although public banks (pbb) 1h17 net profit accounted for only 45.7% of our full-year forecast (and 48.9% of bloomberg consensus estimates), we regard the results as in line, as 2h is traditionally stronger than 1h, cimb said. the groups 2q revenue increased 3.75% from a year ago to rm5.17 billion. it proposed a first interim dividend of 27 sen a share, payable on aug 17. this brought its net profit for the first half (1h) of the year to rm2.6 billion  a 3.8% increase from the rm2.49 billion it made in the same period a year ago. analysts however noted public bank had only just advanced 3.8% in net profit, citing reasons in a drag in non-interest income for the first half, which saw a 0.7% y-o-y drop. the 1h17 non-interest income was mainly dragged down by weaker investment income and foreign exchange gains, cimb said. on a positive note however, it noted pbb's net interest income increase by 8.3% y-o-y in 1h17, was thanks to margin expansion. also, 1h17 loan loss provisioning plunged by 31.9% y-o-y, cimb added. at 12.18pm, pbb rose 0.39% or 8 sen to rm20.50, with 560,300 shares traded."}, "112": {"date_posted":

uncertain sentiment", "article": " lotte chemical titan holding bhd, which debuts on the main market of bursa malaysia on july 11, is still malaysias largest flotation since 2012 despite cutting the size and price of its initial public offering. it remains to be seen if the ipo price cut and companys offer to buy back shares from retail investors from july 12 to 18 are enough to win over wavering sentiment following lukewarm response to the integrated petrochemical producers share offer that was cut to 580 million from 740.48 million. the institutional portion was cut by 23.4% to 524.22 million shares while retail investors only wanted 61.87% or 34.51 million of the 55.78 million shares originally set aside for them. the 21.27 million (underwritten) shares left over from the retail offering were reallocated to institutions, according to malaysian issuing house sdn bhd. global institutions reportedly accounted for 30% of the demand while 23.5% of the shares were taken up by five cornerstone investors, namely permodalan nasional bhd, maybank asset management sdn bhd, maybank islamic asset management sdn bhd, eastspring investments bhd and great eastern life assurance (m) bhd. gross proceeds fell to rm3.77 billion from rm5.92 billion after the ipo price was slashed to rm6.50 from rm8, below the floor of the previously indicated range of rm7.60 to rm8. even so, the ipo has surpassed that of eco world international bhd worth rm2.58 billion in april. lotte chemical titan had wanted to go for listing last year but postponed it after south korea began to investigate conglomerate lotte group for alleged wrongdoing. the company has set aside rm2.8 billion of the proceeds to partially fund its rm15.5 billion integrated petrochemical facility in merak, indonesia. some rm620 million will go towards building a new polypropylene plant in johor and another rm220 million towards upgrading its existing naphtha cracker. the group operates 14 plants in malaysia and indonesia that are supported by on-site facilities such as co-generation plants, tank farms and wastewater treatment. its customers in malaysia and indonesia are mainly plastic fabricators serving the packaging, household, automotive and construction markets. last year, lotte chemical titan was the fourth largest manufacturer of polyolefin products in southeast asia by production capacity. it accounted for 42% of olefin production in malaysia and 29% of polyolefin production in indonesia. its capacity in polyethylene production was 53% in malaysia and 57% in indonesia while it produced all of the polypropylene in malaysia. polyolefins are used to make consumer and industrial products such as packaging film, trash bags, automotive parts, plastic bottles and caps, and compounds for wire and cable insulation while olefins are used as primary feedstock for the production of polyolefin goods. in the financial year ended dec 31, 2016 (fy2016), polyolefin product sales accounted for 80% of the companys revenue. net profit more than doubled to rm1.32 billion from rm613.21 million in fy2015 while revenue fell 0.14% to rm8.14 billion. prior to the cut in the ipo price, several research houses valued lotte chemical titan at more than rm8, and even as high as rm9.10. hong leong investment bank (hlib), however, valued the stock at rm7.39, being 12 times fy2018 earnings. in a june 28 note, hlib research analyst lim sin kiat says the reasons for the stocks lower valuation compared with its larger peers, like petronas chemicals group bhd (petchem), include higher volatility in product spread and lower earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) margin. according to lim, lotte chemical titans naphtha-based feedstock is highly correlated with oil prices, which explains the stocks volatility, while petchem uses ethane, a gas-based feedstock whose prices are more stable. post-2017, global polyolefin capacity surplus over demand is expected to widen further due to us shale-based capacity expansion and methanol-based china capacity additions, the note reads, adding that petchem would be adding 1.4 million tonnes of polyolefin capacity by 2020. the research house expects the expansion in global capacity to weigh on lotte chemical titans ebitda margins and revenue. still, the expected dividend yield of the stock is 3% in fy2017. according to its ipo prospectus, lotte chemical titan aims to pay out about 50% of its net profit every fiscal year on a consolidated basis after taking into account working capital and maintenance capital expenditure requirements. the company will still be controlled by lotte chemical corp post-ipo with a 74.9% stake. maybank investment bank bhd is the principal adviser, joint global

upside, but on this financial roller coaster, most people only want to experience the ups and not the downs. in malaysia, if you had been riding the fbm klci since the end of last year, that thrill is likely to have translated into a roughly 7.4% gain. investors are loving it, and after talking to market analysts, it is clear that optimism is running high as most believe malaysias corporate earnings are moving beyond recovery to growth. affin hwang investment bank chief economist alan tan tells the edge that the countrys first-quarter gross domestic product growth of 5.6% is likely to continue into the second quarter, supported by strong exports of semiconductor and commodity-related products. while we could see some moderation in the second half, gdp growth for the year is likely to be close to 5%, better than what we saw last year. this is in line with the imfs (international monetary fund) projection of 3.5% global growth compared with 3.1% last year. malaysia is also benefiting from the economic growth seen in the developed countries, for example the us, europe, japan, china and emerging asia. what we are seeing now is synchronised growth, which bodes well for the countrys economy, he says. the ceo of asset management company areca capital sdn bhd, danny wong, considers the stronger macroeconomic outlook as a key driver of the malaysian equity market. asia remains the engine of growth globally and malaysia, being a part of it, is showing signs of an uptick in data in terms of export. this would translate into better corporate earnings, especially for the export-oriented industry. coupled with the good sentiment that comes with a potential general election, the market is likely to remain buoyant until the end of the year, he adds. uob asset management (m) bhd executive director and ceo lim suet ling is also optimistic about the malaysian equity market for the rest of the year. although the fbm klci has rallied about 8% year to date, the domestic bourses gain would only put it somewhere in the middle compared with the other asian markets. we believe the rally has been underpinned by a few factors, including a net inflow of foreign funds, positive earnings momentum, an undervalued currency, and the transformation of government-linked companies. these factors continue to be relevant and we expect them to underpin a positive market tone in the next 12 months, she says. edmund tham, head of research at mercury securities sdn bhd, says the main thing to look out for in the second half is election play. construction and infrastructure will benefit the most from election play as we expect more contracts to be awarded in the second half. despite the rally seen so far, i dont think the market has fully priced in some of the projects, he adds. affin hwang ib head of research chue kwok-yan highlights three key triggers for malaysia this year that could pave the way for a long overdue stock market outperformance  equity market inflow, the ringgits return to a sustainable, strengthening path and the return of earnings growth. according to midf research, foreign fund flows into the equity market have trended upwards for most the year  out of 25 weeks, foreigners have been net sellers in only three. in line with this, jp morgan executive director of equity research mak hoy kit thinks major net foreign inflows will drive price-earnings expansion. with the year-to-date 7.6% rise in the fbm klci, one-year forward per (price-earnings ratio) has expanded from 15.6 times to 16.2 times u2026 in the reflationary cycle in 2009, we saw per multiples expand by 5.2 percentage points to 17 times within a year, followed by mean reversion when earnings started to catch up. the average per for the fbm klci over the last 10 years is 15.5 times, he says in his june 1 strategy report. hong leong investment bank head of retail and equity research loui low, however, warns that there could be a pullback in the market in the near term with the support level at 1,760 points.  what to look for in 2h2017 uob asset managements lim says she will be watching the construction sector in the second half as major projects, especially rail-related infrastructure and the pan borneo highway, are expected to be rolled out. we anticipate strong construction job flows and this is expected to sustain interest in the construction sector. identifiable contracts in the medium term include lrt3, the east coast rail link, the pan borneo highway and the remaining packages for mrt2. the construction sector is also on jp morgans radar with gamuda bhd remaining the top pick due to its exposure to more than rm241 billion of rail-related infrastructure spending. gamuda is also affin hwang ibs pick for big-cap construction exposure, as is wct holdings bhd. affin hwang ibs chue says wct is his top pick among mid-cap construction stocks with a 12-month target price of rm2.46. the stock is trading at rm2.07, indicating an upside of 18.8%. we believe wcts chances of securing more local contracts have improved after it secured its first mrt civil works package. the company pre-qualified to bid for the lrt3, west coast expressway and pan borneo highway projects. the change in its major shareholder could accelerate its plan to monetise its assets, such as the potential injection of two malls into a newly listed real estate investment trust this year and reduce its high net gearing of 0.95 times. we expect a strong three-year core earnings per share compound annual growth rate of 50% in fy2017 to fy2019, chue says. another fund manager who prefers to remain anonymous says george kent malaysia bhd is one of the mid-cap players in the sector that is likely to benefit from the infrastructure spending in the country. inari amertron bhd is one of affin hwang ibs top picks as it believes the electronic equipment manufacturers expansion into the new iris infrared chip (iris ir) could provide additional growth for the group. this [expansion into iris ir] and a steady improvement in the utilisation for its radio frequency business could drive our expected three-year forward net profit cagr of 26%, chue says. to an analyst with a local research house, globetronics technology bhd is a semiconductor player that has consistently delivered good results. the earnings visibility of globetronics has improved, especially with clearer signs from its new sensor products, particularly light sensors. the risk of a turnabout in the sensor business is also small, considering that light sensors are part of a critical component for its customers. hong leong ibs low believes this may be a good time to revisit the glove players that have had a rather quiet year in comparison with the market. the demand for gloves is still there and most of the glove players are very efficient in their management. the recent decline in raw material prices could re-ignite interest in the sector, he says. tokyo commodity exchange rubber future contracts had plunged 85.4% from a one-year high of u00a5367 seen at the beginning of the year to u00a5198 at the time of writing. an investment manager opines that other than gloves, the countrys largest condom manufacturer, karex bhd, appears attractive, especially after it fell 28.9% from a year ago. i think it is a bottom-fishing strategy for karex. with its distressed valuation, perhaps its a good time to accumulate for the long term. while the results are falling on the back of an intense pricing competition as well as sustained marketing expenses to build its own brand manufacturing (obm) business, karex has a strong track record.  consumer sentiment bottoming out other than construction, consumer sentiment has hit bottom, especially with the gradual recovery in the ringgit vis-u00e0-vis the us dollar, says lim. another fund manager agrees, naming oldtown bhd as one of his top picks, given the expansion of capacity in its fast moving consumer goods business in china. classic scenic bhd, one of insider asias top picks and which is featured in tongs value investing portfolio (page 18), is another counter that has continued to record better earnings. in its latest report, insider asia remains sanguine about the prospects for the worlds largest manufacturer and exporter of high-end wooden picture frame mouldings. we expect the company to maintain its growth momentum this year, underpinned by rising demand for its products on the back of the improving us economy and stronger housing market, it says. while the banking sector outperformed the market in the first half of the year, investors are optimistic that it will remain strong as it is a proxy for gdp growth. jp morgans mak says while the research house is more upbeat about banks, it will focus on quality banks, given the potential binary risk in a pick-up in non-performing loans. we have removed cimb holdings bhd, which has outperformed the fbm klci by 32% year to date, and replaced it with public bank bhd. cimb has outperformed public bank by 40% year to date, so we think it is time to make the switch. affin hwang ib, meanwhile, is positive about the big three, namely malayan banking bhd, public bank and cimb.  what to avoid in 2h2017 on what sectors to avoid, lim says uob asset management is cautious about telecommunications because of the competitive pressures while valuations have not reached levels that are deemed attractive. according to mak, jp morgan continues to avoid maxis bhd because of a potential negative dividend surprise and upcoming spectrum payments. malaysian reits have also been downgraded by affin hwang ib to neutral for tactical reasons. we are of the opinion that investors should allocate higher weightage to cyclical names in an economic upturn at the expense of more defensive and high-yield sectors like mreits, chue says. with oil prices staying below the us$50 per barrel level, investors are advised to be cautious about upstream oil and gas players. jp morgan believes the sector is likely to see utilisation and rate pressures, given the limited activity in the space. while optimism is riding high in malaysia, other markets, especially american, are showing signs of fatigue. with the dow jones industrial average and s&p 500 having reached historical highs last month, analysts have turned cautious. bill gross, co-founder of pimco  where he managed the worlds largest bond fund  and now a portfolio manager with janus henderson, warned last month that financial markets were increasingly at risk. however, bullish investors over here point out that the fbm klci is still 6.8% below its all-time-high close of 1,892.65 points in july 2014. certainly, those on the investing roller coaster should remember that what goes up must come down. but for now, barring unforeseen circumstances, the benchmark index should maintain its upward momentum, supported by overall positive sentiment.

make a cash call to fund its acquisition of i&p group sdn bhd, and mixed views from analysts on the plan. as at 11:35am, it fell 25 sen to rm3.37 with 1.81 million shares traded. while s p setia's cash call decision to fund its acquisition of i&p group from permodalan nasional bhd is seen positive by research houses, analysts cautioned it may come with short-term pain to its fy18 earnings. the acquisition, which was first announced in april, will proceed with a deal for rm3.65 billion, as the parties signed a conditional share purchase agreement yesterday. for cimb research, the size of the cash call comes as a negative surprise. \"based on s p setia's latest closing price and shares outstanding, a 20% discount to the theoretical ex-rights price for the rights shares, and a hypothetical 10% discount to the price of placement shares would increase its shares outstanding by 26%,\" it said in a research note today. it added the additional earnings contribution from i&p group may not fully offset the interest cost and dividends for preference shares relating to the acquisition if i&p group's core net profit for fy18 is the same as cimb research's estimate of rm69 million in fy16. s p setia will borrow rm1.5 billion to partly fund the acquisition. the balance will be mainly funded by two rights issues, one each for ordinary and preference shares, that may raise up to rm1.2 billion each. s p setia also plans for a private placement exercise to raise another rm1.2 billion after the rights issues to fund the development of i&p group's land bank. the prices and entitlement basis of the cash call will be determined at a later date but the rights issue of ordinary shares will be priced at 20% discount to the theoretical ex-rights price. it has been reported earlier that the corporate exercise would substantially increase s p setia's land bank from 5,141 acres to 9,417 acres, making it the third largest in the country and would potentially make it the largest listed property developer in the country. on the other hand, publicinvest research was more positive. \"the proceeds to partly fund the deal effectively will strengthen the capital base of the group and minimise dilution to eps as rcps are not expected to be converted immediately. the proposed placement could potentially expand the institutional shareholding of the group and also improve further share liquidity by way of increased free float,\" said publicinvest research. nonetheless, the acquisition is said to hold great promises if s p setia manages to replicate its success stories on i&p group's land bank. \"compared to i&p group, sp setia has a much stronger brand name and better track record in developing property projects. we expect s p setia to take up to one year to integrate the two companies and draw up new plans for i&p group's land bank. \"s p setia is confident that i&p group's assets will boost its sales in fy18. however, we think the sales will only translate into meaningful earnings starting fy19,\" said cimb research. cimb research maintains \"hold\" with an unchanged target price of rm3.65, as it factors in the downside risk of the large cash calls on s p setia's fy18 eps. publicinvest maintains \"outperform\" with a higher target price of rm4.50 on its sizeable land bank, consistent performance and earnings visibility.

pushed the countrys palm oil stockpile to 1.56 million tonnes  the lowest level for may in the past eight years. the inventory level at 1.56 million is also the lowest in two months. what we are seeing is a seasonal demand for domestic and international consumption, especially now that the festive season to mark the end of ramadan (fasting month) is fast approaching towards the end of this month, cimb investment bank bhd regional head of plantations and head of malaysia equity research ivy ng lee fang told the edge financial daily over the telephone. malaysian palm oil board (mpob) announced that the countrys palm oil inventory fell 2.6% to 1.56 million tonnes recorded at end-may from 1.6 million tonnes a month ago, the lowest since march this year, and the lowest recorded since 2010 for the month of may. the palm oil stock also declined year-on-year for the first time, which we deem it to be replenishment for domestic consumption, she added. despite the dip in monthly palm oil inventory, mpob said malaysia continued to record stronger production and exports of the crude palm oil (cpo) in may. on cpo production, mpob data showed that it grew 6.88% to 1.65 million tonnes in may from 1.55 million tonnes in april, the highest production so far this year, which ng deemed it as partial recovery from the el nino weather effect. cumulatively, mpob said cpo production totalled 7.4 million tonnes from january to may this year, which made up 42.7% of last years production. on a yearly basis, it is worth noting that the countrys cpo production has been on a downward trend since the last two years, declining to 17.32 million tonnes in 2016 from 19.96 million tonnes in 2015. as for exports of the cpo, mpob said they grew 17.33% to 1.51 million tonnes in may from 1.28 million tonnes a month earlier. the higher exports in may were due to stronger demand from india and pakistan as the consuming countries stocked up ahead of ramadan festival, ng added. mpob said malaysias total palm oil exports to india went up 70.13% to 273,699 tonnes in may from 160,878 tonnes in april, while exports to pakistan soared 97.48% to 108,185 tonnes in may from the preceding month. between january and may this year, mpob noted that malaysia exported 6.45 million tonnes of the cpo, which made up 40.19% of last years cpo exports of 16.05 million tonnes. going forward, ng said plantation companies remain cautious about production prospects for june and are guiding for flat to contraction. this could partly be due to the fact that there are 30 days in june compared with 31 days in may and productivity may drop as workers take time out to celebrate the hari raya aidilfitri festival from june 25 to june 26, added ng, who is maintaining a neutral stance on the agribusiness sector. as for cpo price outlook, ng expects it to be supported in the near term, in view of the tight supplies in the near term from malaysia and indonesia. the projection for lower stockpile for end-may is supportive for near-term cpo prices and we predict stock could be tighter in june, ng said, forecasting the cpo to average at rm2,600 per tonne this year.\n"}, "129":

profit margin of above 30% outpaced an average 18% margin of other pure condom original equipment manufacturing (oem) players. how quickly this will translate into an improved bottom line remains to be seen. of the eight analysts covering the counter, seven have cut their target prices and two downgraded their calls on the stock, which also saw a 39.43% cut in bloombergs consensus earnings forecast for the groups financial year ending june 30, 2017 (fy17). cimb research, which has set the lowest target price of rm1.70 for karex and downgraded it from hold to reduce, commented that current valuations are expensive and advised investors to reconsider the stock only on further share price weakness. credit suisse, which had also downgraded the stock from outperform to neutral, said that the group had now shown several quarters of earnings disappointment. however, it remains hopeful that recovery in the groups tender segment could mask the gestation period of its obm venture, which is a long-term positive. karex remains focused on its core segments of obm, oem or commercial and its tender segment, goh said, adding that despite variance in yearly profits, the group is committed to long-term sustainability. in our two main segments [of oem and tender], we think more people will start coming to us instead of us looking for customers, said wong. rising competition in the tender segment also contributed to the groups unexpectedly weak quarterly earnings, said analysts. the segment, which relies on contractual orders from governments, non-governmental organisations and the world health organization, made up a larger share of karexs revenue at over 30% in 3qfy17 compared with the two preceding quarters. however, goh foresaw orders coming back in a big way with a surge in emergency orders after fierce price competition and healthcare budget cuts, particularly in europe, depressed earnings across the industry. although goh believes the condom manufacturing industry is ripe as it squeezes out smaller, underperforming players, he maintains that karex is no longer considering any acquisitions after its buying spree last year that saw it spend some rm60 million between 2015 and 2016. he insists that building the groups own brand has been the aim since the groups listing on the main market of bursa malaysia in november 2013 with an opening price of 82 sen. value is not in making a product [cheaply] but in where the brand is, he said, adding that karex aimed to market one as a premium sexual wellness brand. the past two years were something of a perfect storm for the group as a sharp depreciation of the ringgit boosted karexs net profit by as much as 72% year-on-year in fy15 from fy14, goh said. its share price more than doubled from the start of 2015 to an all-time high of rm3.09 in the second week of 2016. however, high latex costs and a weak pound, which had increased costs at recently acquired subsidiary pasante healthcare ltd, crimped margins in the second half of last year, subduing profit growth despite a significant depreciation of the ringgit."}, "131": {"date_posted": "2/6/2017", "title": "rhb to buy ammbs assets and liabilities in all-share deal", "article": " petaling jaya: rhb bank bhd and ammb holdings bhds merger plan involves rhb buying all of the latters assets and liabilities in an all-share deal. rhb told analysts that it hoped to do the deal at one-time book value (bv). rhb group managing director and chief executive officer (ceo) datuk khairussaleh ramli, in an analyst briefing yesterday, said it would be issuing shares for ammbs assets and liabilities, and stressed that there would be no cash involved. this throws up questions as to how ammbs largest shareholder australia and new zealand banking group ltd (anz), which has been looking to sell its 23.78% stake, will exit. anz said last november that it planned to sell its stake over the next 12 to 18 month. an industry observer noted that as much as anz would likely want a cash exit, it would be too costly for rhb. both banks are trading just under one-time book value now, so if a share deal happens at book value, anz and any other shareholder could exit at a later date, the observer opined. khairussaleh told analysts that this was the right time for the two banks to go into a merger, particularly because both are trading at close to their bvs. so, if we can do it at book, that will be great. we minimise goodwill to optimise the financial outcome, he said. an all-share deal would be less dilutive, according to a banking analyst who attended rhbs briefing. they expect to overcome dilution in two to three years, he said. in a report yesterday, dbs group research noted that in may last year, anz wrote down its investment in ammb to 0.9 times bv, which fuelled speculation that anz might be willing to relinquish its stake for as low as one-time bv. sources said there is a strong possibility that the employees provident fund (epf), which is the common shareholder in both banks, will end up being the biggest shareholder of the merged entity. it currently has a 40.7% stake in rhb and 9.91% in ammb. rhb and ammb, in separate stock exchange filings yesterday, said they had obtained bank negara malaysias approval, which is valid until nov 30, to start discussions for a possible merger of their business and undertakings. this confirms a report in the the edge malaysia weeklys march 20 issue that cited sources as saying that the two were exploring a merger and that there had been preliminary talks among some of their key shareholders. the two banks have now entered into a three-month exclusivity agreement, which expires on aug 30, to negotiate and finalise the pricing, structure, and other terms and conditions. they said there could be an automatic extension of the exclusivity period, if needed. it is envisioned that the transaction will effectively be an all-share merger, they said in a joint press statement yesterday. in the statement, khairussaleh said: we are confident that if the proposed merger takes place, it will create greater synergy for the enlarged banking group, benefiting our shareholders, customers, employees and all other stakeholders. he told analysts that the merger would make the group no 1 in asset management, general insurance and equities broking, and no 2 in islamic banking. it would also make it the 9th largest bank by assets in asean, creating a bigger platform for it to grow further at home and regionally. in an email to staff yesterday, khairussaleh stressed that it would be business as usual at rhb. to be able to compete effectively in the banking industry, and provide the platform for future growth, we believe that having scale to our business is key. a merger will help accelerate this objective, he said. should the discussions lead to a merger, he assured the staff that the group would take the necessary steps to ensure a smooth integration of rhbs business and operations with that of ammb. at a town hall meeting with senior staff, he said that if all went well, the parties hoped to get the deal completed within a year. meanwhile, ammb, in its town hall with senior staff, said it would be good for the group to move up in the size rankings. rhb and ammb combined would have total assets of rm365.88 billion, only slightly behind the third largest banking group public bank bhds rm380.05 billion. ammb, on its own, is the sixth largest. this new chapter that is opening in the ambank groups history, comes at an opportune time for us as we have been moving closer to achieving our top 4 goals. i am positive that the proposed merger with rhb will create a stronger business and financial presence. our combined strength in key business segments, particularly in retail and investment banking, will bode well for us as we move forward to achieve our goal of becoming a formidable banking group, its group ceo datuk sulaiman mohd tahir said in the press statement. apart from the epf, rhbs other major shareholders are aabar investments pjs (17.75%) and osk groups tan sri ong leong huat (10.13%). over at ammb, founder and chairman tan sri azman hashim holds a 12.97% stake. he is retiring from all his positions within the group over the next two years, and hence, likely to be more open to paring down his stake. uob kay hian research, in a report early yesterday, opined that the merger would require a fair degree of cost rationalisation given the amount of operational and revenue duplication between ammb and rhb. the combined entity will have 453 branches versus maybanks 363 branches. both banking groups have sizable corporate and investment banking franchise. post merger, rhbs cost-to-income ratio, casa (current account savings account) ratio and loans-to-deposit ratio would deteriorate, given ammbs poorer financial metrics in these areas. in terms of loans profile, rhb would experience a slight uptick in overall consumer loans composition from 46.8% to 49.7%, as a result of ammbs relatively larger auto loans portfolio. given such a scenario, the synergies of the merger will have to come from a cost angle which was a key hurdle to the previous proposed merger between cimb-rhb-malaysia buildings society bhd, it said. both the stocks of ammb and rhb will resume trading today. as the revenue synergies between the two groups are not compelling, we expect the market to react negatively to the acquirer, assuming it is unable to reap the full cost rationalisation benefits. sentiment on ammb would depend on whether there is a cash option for shareholders to exit, uob kay hian said. rhb stock, which has gained 15% so far this year, last closed at rm5.39, trading at a price-to-bv (pbv) of 0.97 times. ammbs has gained over 20% and last closed at rm5.21, trading at a pbv of 0.98 times."}, "132": {"date_posted": "1/6/2017", "title": "higher profits from proton,

division slip into the red following the sarawak governments drastic tax hike on hill timber logs from july 1. the group says it was originally expecting the plywood segment, which contributed over a third of revenue and 4% of pretax profit last year, to break even in this financial year ending dec 31 (fy2017). but the tax increase is estimated to add about rm100 per cu m in costs for every cu m of plywood produced by the group. with costs of local plywood ranging from rm1,600 to rm1,700 per cu m, that represents an increase of up to 6%. to recap, in mid-april, the sarawak government announced the first increase in the hill timber premium  the tax chargeable on logs harvested from hill forests and hill species logs from agri-conversion areas  in over three decades. the premium had remained unchanged at 80 sen per cu m for hill logs and rcu m per cu m for logs of hill species from agri-conversion areas since 1986. beginning july 1, both categories will be charged rm50 per cu m. however, the impact for the plywood segment is magnified as it takes two cubic metres of raw logs to produce one cu m of plywood, the company explains. given the weak market for plywood in japan, there is little chance of passing on the costs via higher prices to buyers, a spokeperson for ta ann tells the edge. worst case scenario, [we may see] a small loss on the plywood side, in single-digit millions. that said, the possibility of the segment posting a loss is only on a worst-case scenario basis, he stresses, given that the hikes impact would only be felt for six months in fy2017. he adds that the plywood segments performance would depend on selling prices achieved in the coming months, sales volume and the ringgits performance against the us dollar. in fy2016, ta ann saw revenue rise 9.4% year on year to rm1.15 billion but pre-tax profit declined by a quarter to rm175.7 million. group net profit fell 29.4% y-o-y to rm135.1 million. the group attributed the slowing performance last year to challenging conditions for its timber operations, which offset stronger earnings from its oil palm plantations. in particular, the average selling price (asp) for export logs fell 12% y-o-y to us$235 per cu m while the asp for plywood declined 10% y-o-y to us$450 per cu m. for perspective, ta anns timber business has three divisions  logging, sawmilling and plywood. the plywood division made up 34% of revenue and 4% of pre-tax profit, the logging operations contributed 12% of revenue and 35% of pre-tax profit, and the sawmilling division contributed 2% and 1% respectively in fy2016. it is noteworthy that fy2016 saw ta anns oil palm segment contribute the majority of group revenue for the first time at 52.9% compared to the timber segment. the oil palm segment also made up 60% of pre-tax income last year. the oil palm segment has been on a four-year growth streak up to fy2016 on higher volume of fresh fruit bunch (ffb) and crude palm oil (cpo) prices. that may continue if ta ann manages to achieve a higher average cpo asp in fy2017 compared to just below rm2,400 per metric ton (mt) last year. in a report released last friday, cimb research expects that cpo prices will reach as high as rm2,800 in may and average rm2,600 for 2017 overall. after rising from around rm2,300 per mt to just above rm3,200 per mt in the second half of 2016, cpo prices have since retreated to just over rm2,600 per mt as at end-april. ta anns share price has tracked the decline, falling about 16% from the start of the year up to may 12. closing at rm3.52 per share last friday, ta ann is trading below all analysts target prices at the time of writing. out of nine analysts tracking the stock, two have buy calls, while the remaining seven have a hold, with target prices ranging from aminvestment banks rm3.60 up to affin hwang investment banks rm4.79. we still expect to do reasonably well in the oil palm segment given [anticipated] growth in ffb output by around 10% due to growth in mature area and increase in age profile, ta anns spokesperson says. in terms of cpo asp, we should be able to do better than last year, says the company, adding we have some forward sales which locked in prices at higher levels (above rm2,800 per mt) entered into earlier which will help increase overall sales price. should the segments performance remain robust this year, it may offset further softening of the timber division. overall, the tax hike will add rm8 million to rm10 million to the groups log costs as half its production is from hill logs. for fy2017, ta ann expects a lower log output of around 350,000 cu m compared to 447,000 cu m last year due to its ongoing forest management units (fmu) certification exercise. recall that the state has reduced the log export quota to 30% beginning june 2016. this means roughly 105,000 cu m of the expected log output this year will be exported and ta ann is confident that the additional costs from the tax hike will be manageable for export logs. the extra rm50 works out to just us$12 at the current forex rate, which is 5% of the export log price  manageable and not impossible to pass on. furthermore, with tight supplies for logs given the reduced export quota, a 5% to 10% price increase isnt unreasonable, says the ta ann spokesperson. for the remaining 70% of ta anns expected log output, however, processing costs will rise significantly. the group says it typically transfers its non-exportable logs to downstream units via inter-company sales and the transactions are based on market prices. milling logs typically transact at around rm360 per cu m, so a rm50 increase translates into around a 13% increase, adds the spokesperson.

cycle had crimped production. el niu00f1o is a weather event associated with the warming of the central and eastern tropical pacific, an area surrounding parts of indonesia. the inverse la niu00f1a event results in a cooling of the same areas. increased production dampening prices\nas a result, palm oil companies are flagging the possibility of lower prices for the rest of the year. already, cpo prices were down 12.8% y-o-y to rm2,886 as at may 17. in a press release accompanying its 1q results, wilmar international chairman and ceo kuok khoon hong warned that lower cpo prices would affect the companys plantation and palm oil mills operations, but they would be partially offset by higher production. likewise, first resources notes in its outlook that palm oil prices have moderated because of improving supply prospects for palm and other edible oils, as well as muted demand from importing countries such as india and china. it adds that the longer-term fundamentals of the industry remain positive, despite the shortterm volatility in palm oil prices. olam international co-founder and ceo sunny verghese says he expects a fairly strong pickup in production beginning from the second quarter of this year. the commodities trader expects production in malaysia and indonesia to rise 6.3 million tonnes from a year ago, with combined production totalling 54.8 million tonnes this year. our estimate for malaysia palm oil production recovery is probably in the top range of consensus forecasts. we expect malaysian cpo production to increase by 2.7 million tonnes this year, which would take total production to about 20 million tonnes, says verghese. in indonesia, the market consensus is that the crop will increase by 4.1 million tonnes to 4.2 million tonnes. but our house estimate is at the lower end of that range, at 3.7 million tonnes. that would bring production in indonesia to 34.8 million tonnes. while verghese is bearish on the palm oil market in the short term as a result of the recovery in cpo production in both malaysia and indonesia, he says the medium-term outlook will hinge largely on the weather in the second half of the year. el niu00f1o in 1997 and 1998, which was one of the worst el niu00f1os we have seen, was accompanied by a strong la niu00f1a, which was positive for palm oil production. this time, la niu00f1a is a weak one, so we dont expect any big uptick as a result of the traditional pattern of a strong la niu00f1a, following a strong el niu00f1o, verghese says. moreover, there remains an outside prospect of another el niu00f1o in the second half of the year, he warns. its too early to call, but we are watching this closely to see whether there will be an impact. if there is a severe el niu00f1o in the third or fourth quarter, there could well be some impact on the 2018 crop. but if el niu00f1o is mild, then of course we will see a revival in production. verghese expects cpo prices to be in the range of rm2,200 to rm2,700 this year. ivy ng, regional head of plantations and head of malaysia research at cimb research, is slightly more optimistic. our view is that in the near term, prices may be supported [by] the upcoming fasting month, as well as the hari raya festival in june. with the festival coming up, there could be some workers taking time out to celebrate the festival, so harvesting of fruits may not be at its full potential, ng says. she expects cpo prices to average at rm2,600 this year. barnabas gan, an economist at ocbc bank, thinks demand for palm oil should remain sustained for the year. crude palm oil demand appears resilient, as recent export data reported by intertek malaysia indicates. given the global growth and export recovery, palm oil demand, especially in key consuming countries such as india and china, will remain. he expects cpo prices to weaken towards rm2,650 by year-end. first resources is top pick\nanalysts appear to be most optimistic about the prospects for first resources this year. bloomberg data shows 14 buy calls and four hold calls on the stock. first resources has also been the best performer this year, up 4.7% year-to-date. among those with a buy call is dbs group research, which has a price target of $2.15 for the stock. the research house expects first resources production of fresh fruit bunches to increase 16% this year, and forecasts earnings growth of 41.5% for fy2017 ending december. at the other end of the spectrum is golden agri, which has lost 14% of its value this year. analysts are also least optimistic about this stock: there are three buy, eight hold and six sell calls. cimbs ng, who has a reduce call and a price target of 37 cents for the stock, says the company has unexciting output prospects beyond fy2017, as 47% of its estates are above 19 years old. broadly, the oil palm planters have underperformed the benchmark straits times index this year. excluding olam and wilmar, which are typically valued as diversified agri-commodities plays, the sector has declined 5.4%. the sti is up 11.9% for the year to may 17.  this article appeared in issue 780 (may 22) of the edge singapore."}, "142":

focused and better prepared for the future. but what is next for our corporations and institutions? while it is acknowledged that we have strengthened the foundations of our many organisations, the world races on. if these newfound efficiencies are not rapidly leveraged in our path towards global championship, then the u00adpotential for regression in the way we compete and sustain advantage in markets at home and abroad will u00adremain high. in a digitally driven and fast-converging global economy, not only consumers but also public audiences determine business reputations and market values where performances reflected in stock prices are sometimes beyond the full control of companies and organisations. in the boardrooms of the branded, it is not just stock movements that are being actively tracked today. of equal importance is the impact of social media commentary as a parallel barometer on the health of companies, products and services. given that business agility remains important to corporate success, a critical aspect not yet dominant in our institutional mindset is how to relate business performance with market perception or stock price with consumer sentiment. the solution to strengthening this linkage is brand power  the ability to attract, manage and sustain market support better than the competition. malaysian companies are already strong but when not reinforced with the right foundations, the best of structures can break down. similarly, the strongest of businesses can quickly lose dominance without the support of loyal markets at home and elsewhere. the crucial next step, which will define our future efforts and legacy as a nation, is not just continuous transformation but the bastion of brand power. to effectively compete on the world stage, we need to build the essential pillars of brand building in form (identity), character (credibility) and delivery (experience). in other words, we cannot create brands only at design, marketing or communications level but elevate brand building to the policy level of the organisation to be championed by boards as a business strategy. if the future of any enterprise depends on the growth and retention of favourable markets, why is stronger brand learning and investment not a board policy to be instituted and monitored for strategic impact?  brand-aware, not brand-driven the answer to this question is that most of us are brand-aware but not yet brand-driven. as consumers, when we think of a brand, we recall a visual or a jingle: a name, symbol, tune or a combination of all to identify the producer or retailer of a certain product or service. in their tangible forms, brands are recognised through the familiarity of logos, colours, marketing materials and other physical or digital expressions. however, we also know that a brand is more than just a name and a logo. we connect with the brands we support as we like what we see, what we feel and what we remember in our experience with them better than the others. whether it is a bank, a detergent, a favourite apparel brand, a mobile service provider or the way we choose to transport ourselves, we remain faithful to our chosen brands like timeworn friends through the trust built and the promise of delivery between customer and producer. but what has this brand affinity got to do with the making of malaysias global champions? and why should companies be more brand-driven? consider this. if market goodwill drives bottom-line performances through how consumers applaud and differentiate organisations for their products and services, why is the building of brands (which includes the corporate or institutional brand) not embedded in business policy to guide and converge management thinking within current business planning objectives and processes? and why do we not invest enough in what our consumers see, feel and experience in our offerings, especially in markets populated by those with the power to attract and retain market support? why do we not enhance our competences to confidently enter and grow markets the same way as the branded?  barriers to better branding in malaysia, the barriers to better brand building and goodwill management are many: u2022 absence of essential brand pillars. as a developing economy, there is a tendency to adopt mature-market knowledge and practices to u00adshorten learning curves in everything we do, from strategic planning to production, operations, marketing, distribution and sales. while much of our success has been premised on the production and marketing of goods and services that is comparable to the best in the world, not many have achieved competitiveness through brand power without the convergence of the essential brand pillars  board policy, commitment, investment and knowhow; u2022 stage of market readiness. in transitioning from production to market orientation, there is an urgent need to evolve developed market practices to one that better suits our stage of market readiness for greater brand success. for example, brand responsibility still resides with product development, marketing or communications, and is not yet conceptualised and designed at strategic levels of the organisation. products and services are often developed without brand thinking, thereby negating the effectiveness of marketing and promotional support when it is left too late. finally, brand investments u00adbeyond marketing and advertising are seldom adequate to get the product or service brand right in the downstream phase of marketing and distribution; and u2022 brands as an expense, not strategic assets. without policy-driven investments to u00adensure the evolution of a living brand with the potential to become a market winner, measuring the impact of brand investments on business performance is seldom executed. this constraint continues to hamper better brand thinking and commitments at many of our organisations.  global champions with investment in brand building generally limited to advertising and promotions (a&p), in emerging markets, with the exception of a few in asia  toyota, samsung, sony, honda, hyundai, canon, nissan, panasonic, kia, huawei and lenovo  not many made it to interbrands top 100 as brand-driven global champions last year. in a 2016 regional exploration of consumer u00adattitudes, airasia (41) was the lone made in malaysia brand among asias top 100 brands ranked by global information and insight provider, nielsen. among asias top 1,000 brands in 2016 were maybank (397), mister potato (398), petronas (409), spritzer (470), poh kong (506), malaysia airlines (514), habib (607), boh (608), maxis (636), firefly (713), mamee (730), poslaju (737), cimb bank (741), caring pharmacy (760), celcom (871), bonia (913), digi (914), takaful malaysia (925) and mydin (938). the survey with 6,400 respondents from 13 asian markets (including australia) and across 14 major categories tracked the most popular brands in asia from a consumer perspective. the robustness of the malaysian brand will depend on the brand power of our homegrown champions. twenty-one brands or 2% of the 1,000 most-favoured asian brands is a start but if brand equity (the market value a brand potentially generates) is a significant business performance indicator, then more companies need to be empowered with the knowledge and capability. this is not only to retain the goodwill that drove returns on investments in the past but also to confidently compete for market support in the future. the endgame for malaysia is to champion at least five made in malaysia brands into interbrands top 100 and target 100 placements on asias top 1,000 brands by 2030. targeting 10 global championships and brand positions over 15 years, south korea, starting in the late 1990s, continues to run the fastest and most impressive brand race in asia. with the full commitment of

cash into the conglomerate. shareholders who decline to subscribe may suffer from up to a 50% shareholding and earnings dilution. yesterdays selldown sent the stock down as much as 12% to an intraday low of rm1.53, with 67.42 million shares changing hands  making it the third most active stock. some rm436 million of market value were wiped off in one day. the counter closed at rm1.54, down 20 sen or 11.5% from wednesdays closing level, giving it a market capitalisation of rm3.36 billion. mrcb on wednesday announced a one-for-one rights issue of shares to raise between rm2.17 billion and rm2.86 billion. being the largest shareholder, the employees provident fund (epf) will inject rm716 million into mrcb, while gapurna sdn bhd rm362 million through the rights issue. epf, which holds a 33.4% stake, and gapurna  the private vehicle of mrcbs group managing director tan sri mohamad salim fateh din  holding a 16.7% stake, have pledged to fully subscribe to the rights issue. the cash call was sweetened by free detachable warrants on the basis of one unit for five shares subscribed. mrcb plans to issue up to 2.86 billion in rights shares, together with up to 571.34 million warrants. the cash raised will go towards funding its property development projects such as the national sports complex (nsc) in bukit jalil here (rm1.21 billion) and partially reduce borrowings (rm826 million), which caught analysts by surprise. hong leong investment bank research analyst jeremy goh noted that mrcb has had a change of tune between now and its investors briefing in november 2015. during its investors briefing in november 2015, management reassured that no cash call will be required to fund the [nsc] project as it was mulling to set up a property development fund, coupled with proceeds from the disposal of shell tower. as such, this rights issue is certainly a significant change to the tune of what was earlier guided, he said in a note to clients yesterday. goh said he is not upbeat on the proposed rights issue as mrcbs earnings per share (eps) will be diluted by 50%, while the benefits of the nsc project such as the development profits will only come in at a much later stage once the facility is completed. he is putting the stock under review from a sell rating previously, with a rm1.25 target price (tp). in november 2015, the government awarded the rm1.6 billion nsc project to mrcb. this involves the group refurbishing the nsc in return for 92.5 acres (37.43ha) of land in bukit jalil. we are surprised by the proposal. on the positive side, the proposal will have an immediate impact on reducing the gearing of mrcb, which will translate into lower interest costs for the group, and better earnings trajectory, said aminvestment bank analyst azman hussin. however, we believe the substantially enlarged share base of mrcb may have a dilutive impact on the earnings per share of the group moving forward, which will be negative for the shareholders, he said. nevertheless, azman is maintaining his buy call on mrcb, with an unchanged fair value of rm1.89. cimb investment bank analyst sharizan rosely estimates a 24% to 39% dilution to mrcbs eps for the financial year ending dec 31, 2017 (fy17) and 28% to 43% dilution in fy18 after taking into account potential interest savings and income from warrants proceeds. we acknowledge the longer-term

rights issue will reduce the groups current net gearing of 0.71 times to zero before utilising the cash to finance its new property projects such as the national stadium, sentral suites, lot 94 jalan kia peng, kuala lumpur sentral lot f and 9 seputeh. as at end-2016, mrcbs total bank borrowings stood at rm2.94 billion, while its cash balance was at rm592.77 million. loong has also downgraded his

be lower given the amortisation period for the phis has been extended from four years to 14 years. moreover, the group should benefit from growing demand for its manufactured products and services. a potential catalyst would be the renewal of its concession agreement with the health ministry (moh), which is due to expire by 2019. previously, management had said that it was confident of securing a

historically, wilmar's contribution to ppb's profit is around 60% to 70% and he expects this trend to remain in fy17 and fy18, at the least. meanwhile, cimb ib researchs ivy ng lee fang upgraded

offering), in either hong kong or shanghai. we are positive on the proposed plan to list its china operations, as it could help unlock value for the group, she said. wilmars share price has declined

million, due mainly to write-back of receivable impairment and higher sales volume. it wrote back rm1 million of impairment on trade receivables in 1qfy17 against a charge of rm5.5 million in 1qfy16. its gross profit also rose 4.9% y-o-y, in line with our estimate of 4% to 4.5% growth in sales volume in the quarter. we expect gas malaysias earnings to improve in the coming quarters, driven mainly by seasonally higher sales volume. on top of that, its other revenue sources, such as tolling fees and sales of liquefied petroleum gas, should also improve in the coming months due to seasonality. while its sales volume causes fluctuations in quarterly earnings, gas malaysias longer-term earnings are driven by its asset size. under the incentive-based regulation (ibr) framework, its pipeline earnings are a function of rate of return allowed and the size of the assets (regulatory capital value). the company has to date committed to a total of rm220 million (equivalent to 20% of its property, plant, equipment book value) for capital expenditure. this should raise its asset size and increase the absolute profit under the ibr framework. despite the seemingly stable earnings outlook, its earnings profile may change in 2018 once the third-party access (tpa) is implemented. currently, gas malaysia is the owner of its pipeline assets and the sole gas distributor to users that consume less than five million standard cu ft per day of gas. its regulatory capital includes both the book value of its pipeline assets as well as an assumption of working capital required for its distribution business. after the tpa kicks in, other parties will be allowed to access gas malaysias pipelines to distribute gas and the companys distribution business could cease to be regulated by the ibr. as such, its regulatory capital should decline as the working capital that belongs to the distribution business will be separated from the pipeline assets, which should lower its regulatory earnings. however, the distribution business will be a new source of earnings for the company; we think this could offset the decline in regulatory earnings. the gas distribution business will face competition eventually due to new entrants. in the long term, the stocks price-earnings (pe) could derate as gas malaysia currently holds the monopoly. in the short term, however, we think the risk of a pe de-rating is low because the company will still be the sole gas distributor to its existing customers in the near future. this is the reason for us to retain our hold call. the key upside/downside risk to our hold call is higher/lower-than-expected earnings after the tpa implementation.  cimb research, may 10"}, "153": {"date_posted": "12/5/2017", "title": "jaya tiasa falls

y-o-y to rm5.5 million. this was mainly due to a lower forex gain of rm200,000 in 1q of 2017 (1q17) compared with rm1.4 million in 1q16. we estimate that average raw material costs rose 10% y-o-y in 1q17, but this was offset by better wastage control and improved operational efficiency. the company announced its first interim dps of 1.32 sen or 60% net dividend payout ratio, which was below our expectations. daibochi pays dividends on a quarterly basis and the companys dividend policy is to pay at least 60% of its reported net profit. in 1q17, daibochi started supplying consumer packaging to a regional customer in indonesia, which was a positive surprise to us. daibochi is also currently doing trial runs for another multinational corporation (mnc) for fast-moving consumer goods in indonesia and targets to supply to this customer in the second half of 2017. last tuesday, daibochi announced that the myanmar investment commission has approved its proposed myanmar jv. in november 2016, daibochi had proposed to set up a jv company, daibochi packaging (myanmar) co ltd (dpm) with myanmars smart pack industrial co ltd (msp). daibochi said it plans to invest us$6.8 million (rm29.4 million) for a 60% stake in the jv, while msp will inject its assets of plant and equipment for the balance 40% share of the jv and the us$6.8 million in cash. the myanmar jv should help daibochi grow its export business in the asean region and propel it to become one of the largest flexible packaging company in myanmar. daibochi also has the first-mover advantage of doing business with the mncs. although there are currently not many mncs in myanmar, we think it would only be a matter of time before more mncs invest in myanmar. daibochis net debt was rm27 million or 0.15 times net gearing as at end-march. after paying for the 60% stake in dpm, net debt would rise from rm27 million to rm57 million and net gearing would increase from 0.15 times to 0.3 times. however, we are not concerned about the debt level as the companys projected operational cash flow looks strong. we maintain our earnings per share forecasts for now pending further details on the 1qfy17 results and the myanmar jv

year-on-year (y-o-y) to 640 billion rupiah (rm208.4 million) on the back of a 9.1% y-o-y increase in net interest income and a 19.5% y-o-y decline in provisions. the achievements are encouraging considering the prevailing economic environment which is still challenging. while we continue to believe the worst is likely over for the group, near-term growth prospects are likely to be muted as cost and asset quality management remains key priorities. the 9.1% y-o-y increase in its net interest income this current quarter came as a result of further improvements in its funding profile, owing in particular to an 11.6% y-o-y growth in current accounts which consequently raised its current account savings account (casa) ratio to 55.7% (4qfy16: 50.8%). loan growth was a decent 2.9% y-o-y, underpinned by the higher-yielding corporate and small and medium enterprise (sme) segments as the consumer business continues to be weighed by a shift in strategy towards the premium segments for its auto loan book which shrank by 31.9% y-o-y this current quarter. net interest margins (nims) improved to 5.71% in 1qfy17 (4qfy16: 5.64%) as a result of the improvements mentioned above. managements view of the economic environment still being tough in 2017 and the competitive landscape intensifying and keeping margins under pressure is unchanged, with expectations of nims still converging towards the 5% level for the year though it will try to mitigate this through casa-based initiatives. loan growth will be sub-industry at high single digits, driven by the sme and consumer banking segments. very much a bane to the group for a good part of the last three years, asset quality issues in indonesia are finally starting to see some relief though we do acknowledge risks to remain high in light of the weak environment. gross impaired loans ratio is lower at 5.07% (4qfy16: 5.24%). special mention loans declined to 6% (4qfy16: 6.6%) as the group achieved further success in the restructuring of its problematic hotel, agricultural and palm oil-based delinquencies. on its coal-related loans, exposure is now less than 2% of its overall balance sheet, with coverage above 60%. overall loan loss coverage is relatively unchanged at 117.58% (4qfy16: 117.68%) our neutral call on the stock is retained with an unchanged dividend discount based tp of rm5.40 as we opine the share

(1qfy17) revenue rose 11.5% year-on-year (y-o-y) to rm118.9 million, its core net profit dipped 7% y-o-y to rm57 million. this was broadly in line with our expectations but below bloomberg and consensus expectations, accounting for 23% and 22% of the respective full-year estimates. the 1qfy17 income distribution per unit (dpu) of 2.02 sen for 1qfy17 was broadly in line with our full-year dpu forecast of 8.95 sen. the groups 1qfy17 top-line growth of 11.5% y-o-y was attributable to additional income from properties acquired in 1qfy16, namely da men mall, in usj (subang jaya) and intermark mall, kuala lumpur. on the other hand, the 7% dip in core earnings was due to a 78% y-o-y surge in borrowing cost to fund the acquisitions. pavilion kuala lumpur mall (pkl) recorded lower gross revenue (down 2% y-o-y) as the mall is still in the midst of tenant repositioning to improve tenancy mix and we gather this is likely to continue into the first half of 2017. the 1qfy17 net property income grew 4.4% y-o-y to rm79 million as rental income from the additional assets more than offset the increase in property expenses (up 28.7% y-o-y). the higher property expenses were on the back of routine operating expenses pertaining to da men mall and intermark mall as well as lift and escalator replacements in intermark mall. management has expended rm1.1 million of its capital expenditure guidance of about rm20 million to continuous toilet upgrading in pkl and adding food and beverage kiosks in intermark mall. we gather that 1qfy17 portfolio rental reversion was a low single digit. in line with managements guidance, we expect pkl to achieve rental reversion of 2% for the 23% of net leaseable area expiring in fy17 as the majority of expiring leases are for smaller spaces. while management focuses on improving tenant mix in da men mall to increase footfalls, this could come at the expense of reversions, in our view. jones lang wootton is guiding for flat reversions for suburban malls in the klang valley in fy17. further details on the potential injection of pavilion elite (pe), for which the reit has rights of first refusal (rofr), is still scant but management is guiding that this will likely occur by fy17, and an equity-raising exercise remains on the table. while the group also has rofr for fahrenheit 88, the acquisition of this mall is unlikely in the near term, we gather. managements main focus for now will be on pe acquisition, which we gather has an occupancy of about 70% currently but could rise to about 85% by year end. we keep our hold call but lower our dividend discount model-based tp to rm1.76 to reflect lower terminal growth assumptions of 1.8% (from 2.5%). we think the stock is fully valued at current levels. upside risks to our call include higher rental reversions, especially for pkl, and downside risk is increased competition from suburban malls for da men mall. we think pkl will be slightly less affected by the incoming retail supply due to its strong tenant profile.  cimb research, april 27"}, "158": {"date_posted": "21/4/2017", "title": "klci rises 0.35%, eversafe makes solid debut", "article": " kuala

obamacare. the border tax has many opponents. if you notice, the wall has not been mentioned of late. he has also backed down on calling china a currency manipulator, he has recognised there is a one china policy and as he goes more and more into the job, i think he has realised that trade is a complicated matter. a lot of the chinese trades are intra-company trades, the chinese entity of a us company exporting to the us. so i think there is a realisation that it [a trade war] is not going to serve any larger purpose, arup says. after its defeat on obamacare, the trump administration needs a win and will go for an easier win, such as a corporate or income tax cut, he adds. dr yeah kim leng, economics professor at sunway university business school and former ram holdings group chief economist, shares this view: given trumps defeat in repealing obamacare, taxes and trade would now be on his front burner. although he will tread more carefully to ensure the first defeat is not followed by a second one, his administration will likely take a more calibrated approach to the other issues, especially trade, where many us industries and firms have been key beneficiaries with their global footprint in china and elsewhere. the huge presence of us firms in other countries will be a bulwark against a trade or currency war. on a scale of 1 to 10 (high), yeah sees a two to four chance of a full-scale trade war, expecting give and take that will ensure trade and investment flows are not disrupted to the detriment of both economies. george magnus, an associate at oxford universitys china centre and former ubs group ag chief economist, however, is less sanguine. he says, earlier this year, id have said the likelihood was about 8. then trump seemed to back away from more aggressive china talk and the threat of across-the-board 45% tariffs faded u2026 until last weekend, i thought maybe the risk had dialled down to about 4 or 5. since trump lost his obamacare repeal, though, the governments need for wins is even greater, and my view now is that trumps best chance of wins is via routes that dont require congressional approval. they would also detract from domestic difficulties, of course. so, i have pushed the risk of us-china trade conflict back up to around 7. my belief is that this isnt like trade with mexico or germany but about tools with which to weaken china, which is, of course, americas geopolitical rival. but isnt global trade too intertwined for any country to escape unscathed? i dont think we should assume, just because the levels of globalisation today are high and very intricate, that globalisation cant be undermined or reversed by trade conflicts, or worse, trade wars in which nations retaliate against one another. the climate for such a scenario is clearly around now  and in ways which were not the case at any time since 1945, says magnus, who notes there is scope for the us to raise tariffs even under wto rules. think also about the background. since the 2007/08 financial crisis, growth in world trade has barely kept pace with world gdp, whereas in the prior 25 years, it grew about twice as fast. this isnt due to protectionism in the main but it does mean that the globalisation of trade has stalled. the same goes for cross-border capital flows and fdi. neither has recovered the intensity it had before 2008. so, we are looking at a more fragile globalisation anyway, and now one that the us, long the guardian and protector of a liberal trade and investment world order, is threatening to walk away from. that, in a nutshell, is where us populism might lead the global system, he adds. magnus reckons that the us would not threaten or impose tariffs on generic goods but carefully target them so as to not harm us firms. rhb research institute executive chairman and chief economist lim chee sing does not expect a full-scale us-china trade war or the us slapping a 45% blanket tariff on chinese imports. but he does see a 6 out of 10 chances of the trump administration implementing some form of protectionist and anti-trade policies. a trade war may still happen in a globalised world. and if that materialises, it will likely slow down global trade, demand for goods and services and exports of export-dependent countries, and therefore economic growth over time. in the short term, the us may gain at the expense of the rest of the world but in the longer run, everybody loses, lim says. while trade protectionist policies  be it high import tariffs or border adjustment taxes  would encourage us companies to invest and manufacture, and source more of their products domestically, it would also harm the country by raising costs for consumers and reducing the competitiveness of its economy over time, he explains. according to lim, more than a third of chinese exports to the us are computer and electronic products (34.6% of total china exports to the us), followed by electrical equipment (8.8%), manufactured goods (8.6%), clothing (6.7%), machinery (6.6%) and furniture (4.5%). meanwhile, american exports to china are transport equipment (22.5% of total us exports to china), computer and electronic products (15%), agricultural products (14%), chemicals (11.7%) and machinery (7.2%). based on previous anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases, lim expects the steel, chemical, ferrous/non-ferrous metal, paper/timber, agricultural product, textile and machinery industries to be in the line of fire of the trump administration, if there is a trade war. lim reckons that china may impose higher tariffs on automobile products from the us as well eliminate orders of aircraft from boeing if a trade war breaks out. over the past few years, china has begun investigating some anti-dumping measures and anti-subsidies on chemicals, paper, steel, transport and agricultural products imported from the us. industries related to these products may be potential targets if a us-china trade war occurs, he says. if the us succeeds in implementing a border adjustment tax  exempting u00adexports from taxes but imposing a high tax on imports, a form of protectionist and anti-trade policy  affected trade partners will likely retaliate. one way to better prepare for the impact is via diversification of export markets, including signing more trade agreements with other countries. the rcep (regional comprehensive economic partnership), if it materialises, should boost trade for the member countries and cushion the impact of fewer exports to the us. china, for that matter, may also tighten relationships in the region by promoting its one belt one road programme. if there is a trade war u2026 the tech sector in malaysia, for instance, being part of the global supply chain, could be impacted negatively, says lim, adding that slower exports would hit economic growth. thus, the worst possible outcome of the trump-xi meeting would be if china were labelled a currency manipulator and the us immediately moved to censure chinese trade. the world would likely breathe a lot easier if both countries agreed to address the current account/trade imbalances via positive measures without triggering a trade war, something that lim hopes to see. a clear policy direction that both countries will commit to peaceful and orderly trade negotiations, and a reduction in frictions will buoy the markets and growth prospects of the worlds two largest economies. since malaysia has high exposure to both economies, its large export sector will benefit from harmonious trade relations and a rise in global trade and investment, yeah comments. arup, who notes that china has been taking a much more constructive stance, is also looking for some indication of us and china working with each other. magnus, however, is not optimistic that much will be achieved post the trump-xi meet. if the purpose of the meeting is handshakes and photo opportunities, and a non-committal communique in which the us and china make vague claims to cooperate, then itll be quickly forgotten  and assumed to be a win for xi since everyone expects trump to want to make his mark. my hunch is that trump will want to boast that he got some concessions and therefore will raise issues  not human rights, of course  that are contentious. for example, the south china sea and something trade-specific like automobiles, which is a bone of contention [but] i doubt the meeting will end in hostility. xi needs to show hes in control of his countrys most important external relationship, especially since this is the year of the 19th party congress. and xi doesnt want upsets. so my guess is that both men will want to appear tough and in control, and there may be some insights into contentious areas where the two sides are, for now, to disagree.   donald trump\n(age 70)president of the united states  march 30, 2017 27.2 million twitter followers (no 44 globally)

call with a lower target price (tp) of rm1.70: following our recent meeting with igb real estate investment trust (igb reit), we gather that: i) the group will be able to maintain positive rental reversions on the back of strong demand for expiring leases; ii) tenant sales are expected to continue to see high single-digit year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in financial year 2017 forecast (fy17f) to fy19f, underpinned by its strategically located assets; and iii) the leases for aeon and isetan are expiring in fy17f, while metrojayas lease is up for renewal in fy18f.  we concur with management that tenant sales growth for mid valley megamall (mvm) and the gardens mall (tgm) will stay at commendable levels of a high single digit y-o-y in fy17f to fy19f, underpinned by its strategic location, accessibility and diverse tenant mix that caters to price-sensitive consumers (mvm) and more affluent consumers (tgm). the waiting list for potential tenants remains long, suggesting strong demand for expiring leases, which should support positive rental reversions. as a testament to their popularity, mvm and tgm sustained occupancy rates of 99.9% and 99.7% respectively in fy16 and we expect them to remain at these levels in fy17f to fy19f. we forecast expiring leases for both malls in the range of 30% to 40% of total net lettable area (nla) per annum in fy17f to fy19f. mid valley southkey megamall (msm) in iskandar, johor, for which the group has right of first refusal, is on track for end-fy18f completion. if injected into igb reits portfolio, msm will add nla of 1.5 million sq ft (36% of nla). management said tenants in mvm have expressed interest in msm and we gather that msm has received encouraging initial interest from potential tenants. while we are positive on msms potential injection, the earliest it could take place is in fy22 (after one tenancy cycle) to ensure stable rental and occupancy rates for msm. as the group does not see any viable third-party acquisitions currently, given the lack of high-quality malls, any inorganic growth is unlikely in the near to medium term. we lower our expiring lease assumptions for both malls to 30% to 40% of total nla per annum in fy17f to fy19f (versus 30% to 45%) and tenant sales growth to a high single digit y-o-y. as such, we cut fy17f to fy19f earnings per share by 3% to 4%. fy17f to fy19f dividend per share is also lowered by 6% to 7% as we revise our payout assumption to 97% (versus 100% previously), largely in line with the payout in fy16. we maintain our hold call, but our dividend discount model-based tp is lowered to rm1.70, following our earnings revision. we think the stock is fairly valued at the current level. while the group can leverage on its mall locations, high traffic and positive rental reversions from expiring leases, we stay cautious, given the incoming retail space supply and opening of kl gateway in kerinchi in bangsar south, kuala lumpur. an upside risk is strong tenant sales (12% to 15% of rental income is from tenant sales historically), while a downside risk is increased competition from other malls.  cimb research, april 6"}, "165": {"date_posted": "3/4/2017", "title": "ghl in the spotlight", "article": "  kuala lumpur: as ghl systems bhds share price was climbing towards its historical high of slightly above rm1.20, there came the news that the companys substantial shareholder creador, a private-equity fund, had sold its entire equity interest of 28.3% at rm1 per share. in addition, its majority shareholder simon loh had disposed of almost half of his shareholding at the same price. the announcements on the share sale put a cap on ghls share price instantly as the shares changed hands below market price. the stock slipped nine sen or 7.56% to close at rm1.10 last friday. substantial shareholders selling shares usually raises eyebrows. however, in this case, it might not be a bad sign at all. this is because the shares were sold to london-based actis, which has a growing portfolio of investments across asia, africa and latin america. after acquiring a 44.4% stake, actis is currently making a mandatory general offer to the minority shareholders at rm1 per share. ghl chief executive officer (ceo) danny leong, who took over the helm in november, told the edge financial daily in an email that the changes in shareholdings will not affect the companys direction and operations. i am not speaking on behalf of the two shareholders. based on their comments in the press release, creador sold to crystallise its 2.8 times gain on its investment in ghl, which is understandable given its objective as an investment firm. as for simon loh, i understand that he was approached because the new shareholder, actis, wanted a larger position in ghl and after evaluating, simon saw actis as a strategic partner that could help ghl reach greater heights. and note that he remains the second-largest shareholder with a substantial stake of 19%, leong commented. with the experience and expertise in payments globally, actis is able to contribute in our strategic direction in further cementing our position in asean. with their reach and access to emerging payment technologies, we believe their input will be beneficial to ghl as we remain focused on being the leading asean payment service provider, he added. commenting on the transaction price, leong said that ghls share price is undervalued given the companys growth momentum and its foothold within asean. we believe the shareholders started the talks a few months back when the share price was below rm1. the decision to transact at rm1 was solely agreed between the shareholders at that time and not fixed yesterday or a few days earlier.  volume grows despite soft retail sales according to leong, ghl is not affected by current weak consumer sentiment. we are actually seeing our transaction volume increasing [despite the weak retail sales] because people are embracing electronic payments (e-payments) more and more, he said. leong explained that bank negara malaysia (bnm) has issued frameworks and mandates to accelerate the nations migration to e-payments, one example of which is the financial sector blueprint 2011-2020. under the blueprint, the central bank wants to increase the number of e-payment transactions per capita from 44 transactions in 2010 to 200 transactions by the end of 2020, ultimately increasing demand for e-payment solutions across the nation. according to leong, the card payment services division recorded an increase in transaction value of 35.7% in 2016 to rm2.7 billion from rm1.98 billion seen in the previous year, while its e-payment division grew 9.7% to rm3.63 billion in 2016 from rm3.31 billion seen previously. [the combined total] of online transactions and card payment transactions [under the transaction payment acquisition (tpa) segment] reached rm6.2 billion for 2016, leong said. he noted that bnms move to encourage cashless transactions is strong force to drive ghls business volume. this will certainly offset the weak retail sales in the current slowdown. the groups net profit for the fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2016 swelled 38.3% to rm4.4 million from rm3.2 million in the previous years corresponding quarter, while its revenue jumped 17.9% to rm67.2 million from rm56.9 million a year ago, mainly due to growth in its shared services and tpa segments. for the full financial year 2016, its annual net profit ballooned to rm18.1 million, or 2.79 sen per share, from rm10.34 million, or 1.61 sen per share, the year before. revenue grew 16% to rm245.9 million from rm211.38 million.  rising competition bnms cumulative target of 430,000 new point-of-sale terminals for 2017 opens up a window of opportunities for ghl. on the other hand, there is also competition for the company, as commercial banks are competing to meet these numbers, providing customers with their respective e-payment services. leong pointed out that ghl is targeting 1,000 new merchant acquisitions per month this year. he acknowledges that there will be ongoing competition as the group moves forward, but ghl intends to set itself apart by offering additional value-added services such as its partnership with alipay in thailand, under which ghl is in charge of acquiring thai merchants to accept alipay payments from chinese tourists in thailand. we do see some competition, especially in malaysia, because of the [bnm targets], but how we mitigate this is that we [offer additional services] such as e-pay and alipay in thailand, he added. the group also announced in early march that it has teamed up with cimb group holdings bhd to provide card payment services for cimbs corporate clients in thailands retail and services segments. on prospects, leong said that he would like to maintain the groups double-digit growth momentum, and he is fairly confident that it will achieve this."}, "166": {"date_posted": "29/3/2017", "title": "trade wise: pick planters with younger estates", "article": "  unlike the oil and gas stocks that surged on stronger crude oil prices in the wake of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries deal, plantations stocks hardly rallied when crude palm oil (cpo) prices went up from last november through mid-february. the inertia was due to scepticism over just how long the cpo price rally would last. after all, palm oil production had begun to recover from the impact of the 2015-2016 mega el niu00f1o weather pattern that crimped palm oil production in indonesia and malaysia last year. experts anticipation of a recovery in production this year, similar to that of 1999 following the 1997-1998 super el niu00f1o, was a bearish factor, and caused cpo prices to reach as high as rm3,348 on feb 10 (malaysian palm oil board fob spot). it settled at rm2,994 last thursday. but some experts now speak of a smaller cpo production recovery, pointing to what they call a 50% chance of the el niu00f1o weather pattern emerging here in the second half or as early as june. at the time of writing, the chances for an el niu00f1o from august through december this year have climbed above 50% (but below 55%), according to the data on us national oceanic and atmospheric administrations (noaa) website on march 13. depending on its severity, [an el niu00f1o by 3q2017] will have minimal impact on this years palm oil production because the impact will be on 2018s numbers. if there is no el niu00f1o in the second half, 2018 will be a fantastic year [in terms of production]. now, were uncertain because if el niu00f1o comes, production will be affected, says ling ah hong, director of ganling sdn bhd, noting that there is an at least six-month delay in the impact on production. the lag effect on palm oil is scientifically proven. its been observed. theres the first lag [six months], the second [nine to 12 months] and the third [22 to 24 months]. thats how we are able to do the [forecast] model. last year was so bad because the first and second lags coincided. if the drought is 12 months long, that meant the first effect was seen six months later. but the second drought came, so the effect was rolled down, ling tells the edge, explaining how the 2015 drought hit production in 2016 and how the impact on trees can differ. because the [recent mega] el niu00f1o was so strong, the drop in yields lasted for nine months, from january [2016], and the worst hit was august. so, 3q2016 [production] was bad and prices went up and up. the el niu00f1o weather pattern can cause severe drought (dry weather) and water shortage in plantations in this region while la niu00f1a usually brings abundant rain. historically, a (mild) la niu00f1a that follows an el niu00f1o usually assists in yield recovery for oil palm trees, explains ling. it is quite surprising that el niu00f1o is emerging so fast. the shortest gap in the last 50 years was two years. the longest could be seven years. if it emerges this year, it will be two years [2015 was the last]. it is not unprecedented, ling says, adding that 2018s cpo production could be down 6% to 7% if we get a moderately strong el niu00f1o in 2h2017. actually, it is good for prices. plantations wont be so badly affected with a 6% drop because they have young planting, which will help to mitigate [earnings], says ling, who expects this years cpo production to be above 2016s but behind 2015s. what does this scenario mean for investors looking at plantation stocks? ivy ng, head of research and regional plantations analyst at cimb research in kuala lumpur, expects a flattish to marginal rise in planters earnings in 2017 as lower cpo prices are offset by higher output this year. ng  who retains a neutral stance on regional planters share prices and recommends that investors be selective in picking stocks in the sector in a march 9 note  likes singapore-listed indonesian planter first resources ltd (target price: s$2.32) for its young tree age profile, indonesian-listed pt astra agro lestari tbk (target price: idr18,000) for good corporate governance and genting plantations bhd (target price: rm12.30) for its strong output growth prospects. another regional plantations analyst is also in favour of planters with younger palm trees as they not only stand to benefit from the expected production recovery but would also have more palm trees entering prime production (years seven to 18, although trees start bearing fruit in the third year). the increased production means the companies will have more fresh fruit bunches (ffb) and cpo to sell, a factor that can compensate for the lower average cpo selling prices achieved before, she explains. cimbs ng notes in her report that there were more bears than bulls this year in terms of cpo price predictions at the recent annual palm and lauric oils conference (poc). price predictions ranged from rm2,200 to rm3,100 per tonne. we deduced the mean to be around rm2,649 per tonne, ng says, noting how the most bullish forecaster at poc, dorab mistry, director of godrej international ltd, projected that prices would touch rm3,000 a tonne in the near term before falling to rm2,500 in june to july. meanwhile, james fry, chairman of lmc international ltd, expected cpo prices to fall as low as rm2,250 per tonne due to rising palm oil supplies. price predictions for 2016 ranged from rm2,200 to rm3,200 per tonne or an average of rm2,536, but the actual trading range was from rm2,181 to rm3,239 per tonne and the rm2,653 average price was 4.6% higher, as the speakers had not expected production to fall that much. in the past 11 years, actual average cpo prices were above the predictions made for poc2006, poc2007, poc2009 and poc2010, but came in below those for poc2008 as well as those for poc2011, poc2012, poc2013, poc2014 and poc2015, cimbs data show. other than the potential emergence of el niu00f1o later this year, other key bullish factors for cpo prices mentioned by the speakers include indonesias plan to expand its biodiesel usage to non-public service obligations (non-pso) sectors, as well as expectations that china would halt the release of rapeseed oil reserves this year. uob kay hian research in a march 15 note said indonesias biodiesel uptake could surge to six million kilolitres this year, from about 3.3 million kilolitres last year, as the government makes adjustments in view of the potential downside pressure on cpo prices in 2h2017 on stronger cpo production. the indonesia estate crop fund (bpdp) expects the biodiesel procurement volume to match or be marginally higher this year, but could adjust the price of biodiesel lower and extend a subsidy to the non-pso segment. the research house  which expects cpo prices to average rm2,600 a tonne this year and rm2,500 a tonne next year (compared with rm2,653 last year) and acknowledges that there is a risk of a shortfall in biodiesel mandates on lower global crude oil prices  likes singapore-listed bumitama agri (target price: s$1.25) for its young tree age profile and consistent delivery of high oil extraction rates (oer). we also like first resources (target price: s$2.15) for its efficiency in keeping costs low and strong ffb production growth, kim loong resources bhd (target price: rm4.20), astra agro lestari (target price: idr19,045) and sampoerna agri (target price: idr2,190). yet, the chances of an el niu00f1o re-emerging later this year, in addition to the fact that the mpobs february stockpile of 1.46 million tonnes is a six-year low, seem to pale in comparison to the sharp contraction in cpo exports in early march. maybank investment bank regional plantations analyst ong chee ting, for one, is not betting on an el niu00f1o in 2h2017 just yet. recall that the el niu00f1o scare at the start of 2014 turned out to be a non-event, ong told clients in a march 13 note. he has turned cautious on the plantations sector although he reckons the recent cpo price selldown was overdone given the low stockpile and reckons a short-term rebound in cpo prices is possible before prices resume their downward trend going into 2h2017. he is keeping an eye on cpo export trends after independent cargo surveyors intertek and sgs preliminary export estimates for the first 10 days of march suggested a sharp 26% month-on-month decline. while it is still early days, we suspect this sharp contraction in exports was due to a sudden pullback in purchase orders as importers were hoping to buy palm oil at lower prices when the price suddenly fell more than 10% month-on-month in february. nonetheless, this trend is worth monitoring. maybank investment bank has buy calls on boustead plantations bhd (target price: rm1.78), sarawak oil palms bhd (target price: rm4.70), singapore-listed bumitama agri (target price: s$0.96), indonesia-listed astra agro lestari (target price: idr19,000), london sumatra (target price: idr1,470) and tunas baru lampung (target price: idr1,500). thomas mielke, director and editor at ista mielke gmbh, which publishes independent forecasting service oil world, is less concerned about near-term export fluctuations. speaking at the poc, mielke predicted that global supplies of eight major edible oils will increase by 10 million tonnes this year but that would only partly replenish stock drawdowns in the previous year. he reckons that palm oil prices have peaked this year but deems that the february price declines were overdone, adding that cpo prices have to be sufficiently attractive for producers to invest and expand. ling does not think the pace of oil palm planting will return to that enjoyed at the height of the commodities boom, owing to greater pressures on sustainability and environment-related concerns. up until 2020, we will see good production growth in indonesia because planters are planting u2026 but after 2020, most of these trees will have reached their peak. the slowdown in planting started in 2013 because thats when the indonesian government signed the [first] moratorium [with norway]. the greatest slowdown was from 2014/2015 when the non-governmental organisations got very stringent and planters had to do a lot more sustainability studies u2026 and there is the natural slowdown because of lower prices, ling says. will people start planting more? my answer is no. in the next five years, there will be a major slowdown in supply, simply because jokowi (indonesian president joko widodo) is introducing another moratorium, which will include the no deforestation, no peat policy. this moratorium is good for the industry to allow consolidation. the

lipper fund awards: shifts in the landscape", "article": "  the prolonged volatility in global markets is causing a shift in the asset management industry. investors are increasingly looking at assets that are deemed less vulnerable to market gyrations to ensure good returns. as a result, the industry is seeing a proliferation of vehicles that offer passive investing strategies, such as exchange-traded funds (etfs), or platforms powered by financial technology (fintech) such as robo-advisers. the popularity of etfs, which track the performance of a benchmark index, is due to their low fees and the lacklustre performance of actively managed funds in developed countries. by mid-2015, passively managed funds in the us had amassed us$2.97 trillion, surpassing the us$2.96 trillion managed by hedge funds. last year, etfs in the us saw an inflow of us$126 billion  a stark contrast to the outflow of us$228.9 billion seen by mutual funds, according to thomson reuters lipper alpha insight. professional services firm pwc has projected inflows of us$1.1 trillion and us$2.3 trillion by end-2018 and 2021 respectively. this indicates that more investors are going into passively managed funds and fund houses are offering more etfs. this trend is also seen in other countries, where fund houses that provide etfs are seeing more inflows. meanwhile, robo-advisers, which provide automated algorithm-based portfolio management advice, have grabbed 0.5% of the us asset management industrys total assets under management (aum). this figure is expected to rise to 5.6% by 2020, according to management consulting firm at kearney.  passively managed funds yet to gain traction locally etfs have not quite taken off in malaysia despite being made available to investors many years ago. while these funds have taken developed countries by storm, they have not gained much traction in emerging markets, including malaysia, says eastspring investments bhd chief sales and marketing officer yap siok hoon. the number of etfs being offered locally reflects this view. currently, there are only eight listed on bursa malaysia compared with 627 unit trust funds catering for local investors. local etf offerings have not been as wide as those in developed countries. thus, for most investors, unit trusts still offer a wider range and variety of funds in which they can invest, says yap. there are currently three providers of locally listed etfs  amfunds management bhd (aminvest), cimb-principal asset management bhd and i-vcap management sdn bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of valuecap sdn bhd. i-vcap management is the largest provider with four etfs while aminvest and cimb-principal offer two each. indonesia has 10 etfs while thailand has 15 listed on their bourses. these funds mainly track the countries broader stock market and various sectors in that market. the singapore exchange hosts 72 etfs  the highest number in the region  but it is still a far cry from the thousands of etfs in the us. there are more than 1,500 of these funds listed on the new york stock exchange alone. local fund houses do not feel the need to launch etfs, says areca capital sdn bhd ceo danny wong. he points out that even with the 3% to 5% sales charge and 1% to 1.5% annual management fee, a number of unit trusts have outperformed etfs in terms of net returns due to market inefficiencies. we dont think the underperformance is happening in emerging markets due to market efficiency factors and mismatch between value and prices, he adds. bank-backed fund houses such as rhb asset management sdn bhd are confident that their top-tier funds will outperform the markets they benchmark against due to their bottom-up stock-picking ability and available resources. local fund management outfits like us have the advantage of a network of analysts in different locations carrying out on-the-ground research on companies. this enables fund managers to add value via stock and sector selection, says rhb asset management managing director eliza ong. gan kong yik, chief investment officer at kaf investment funds bhd, says the returns from etfs will continue to exceed the average performance of some unit trusts after taking into consideration the total fees incurred. however, we do not believe that it spells the end for actively managed funds. the returns of passively managed investments usually reflect the average market return and outperform the average mutual fund return by minimising the expense ratio. but mutual funds in the top percentile will likely outperform etfs, hence our emphasis on the ability to generate alpha for our investors. we believe in a continuous improvement process in formulating our investment strategy and hope to adapt to different market conditions. nevertheless, it will only be a matter of time before the demand for etfs grows as emerging markets get more efficient, making it harder for actively managed funds to outperform the indices, says phillip mutual bhd fund manager richard cheong. actively managed funds will have the edge in certain segments of the market, especially in the mid and small-cap space, where the disparity in the valuations of these companies are more significant. funds that constantly search for undervalued companies will perform better in this area over time. nonetheless, as the industry grows with more funds competing in the same space, the challenge to outperform will definitely increase, he says. kaf is one of the fund houses preparing for etfs to take off in the country. there are still fewer than 10 etfs listed on bursa, and fewer than five of them provide exposure to the local equity market. also, they are mainly limited to the large-capitalisation companies, says gan. we think that the asset management industry still has a lot to offer [in terms of etfs] to local retail investors by providing more complex products that are value accretive.  fintech still at a nascent stage fintech is already being adopted in the country. but the industry is set to take off with the securities commission malaysia (sc) expected to introduce a framework for robo-advisory services this year. aminvest ceo datin maznah mahbob is well aware of the huge impact fintech can have on the asset management industry over the longer term. those who are not prepared and are slow to adopt it are expected to fall behind when the time comes. fintech firms, including robo-advisers, will pose challenges to fund houses with higher cost distribution models and higher cost of managing funds, which derive from compliance and risk management. new skillsets and approaches need to be developed to address anti-money laundering issues, client sustainability assessments and cybersecurity. those who are able to navigate this shift in the distribution landscape will be the winners in the long run, she says. aminvest, which launched the first local etf in 2007, is showing strong interest in fintech. we are a strong proponent of fintech and yes, we will be embarking on fintech initiatives with many strategic partners to capitalise on this market segment, which promotes transparency, ease of access to our suite of investment solutions and lower cost of entry, says maznah. meanwhile, start-ups in the region have begun operating robo-advisory services. one example is singapore-based smartly, which has already engaged with the authorities and is planning to launch its platform in malaysia when the scs framework is implemented. rhb asset managements ong says there are three possible scenarios of how local fund houses will respond to the implementation of the framework. the first is that we will see asset managers continuing to work with distributors while ignoring robo-advisers. the second is partnering with robo-advisory firms and integrating their services with fund houses existing distribution platform. the third is to set up a new distribution platform using robo-advisers to sell products directly to clients. all these scenarios hinge upon where the fund houses current business is and how sophisticated their distribution channels are. more importantly, robo-advisers will suit the demands of the younger generation, who have grown up in the mobile and internet age. technology is here to stay and will continue to improve. we believe the mass market, youths and millennials, is one of the growth drivers going forward, says cimb-principal ceo munirah khairuddin. but for fintech to bloom, it will require the necessary infrastructure and demand from investors. fintech is still at a nascent stage, with signs of immense potential. however, to flourish, it requires a regulatory framework as well as consumers to reach a level of trust when it comes to placing or transacting monetary assets with start-ups that have short operating track records. they must also be comfortable undertaking financial planning without the human touch, says public mutual bhd ceo yeoh kim hong. face-to-face relationships via unit trust agents, also known as consultants, are expected to continue being the fund houses main distribution channel, she says. we view the development of robo-advisers positively as they will empower financially-savvy investors to conduct and track their investments independently. however, there are many investors who prefer to use the services of unit trust consultants, who can explain, track and provide value-added services to them. our experience shows that investors, especially high-net-worth individuals, still prefer the services of these consultants although they have the capability and access to online investments. robo-advisers are viewed as complementary to unit trust consultants. but some issues still need to be sorted out. hong leong asset management bhd ceo hoo see kheng says he is concerned about the algorithms used by robo-advisers, which are highly dependent on market information and not as transparent as developed markets. robo-advisers use software to run their algorithms to automatically allocate, manage and optimise clients assets. all these rules work well in proper developed markets where information is comprehensive and available in real-time. but for emerging markets in asia or southeast asia, where information is not so comprehensive, it will be a challenge to provide such services on a real-time basis, he says.  seeking new growth areas meanwhile, the unit trust industrys growth is slowing and local fund houses are looking at ways to attract investors. if you look at the market statistics, the unit trust industry has seen flat growth from new money over the past three years. net sales have been challenging due to a combination of factors, ranging from economic climate to high entry fees, says hoo. as at dec 31 last year, the total net asset value (nav) of unit trusts had increased only 5.48% over the last three years, according to information provided by the sc. this was largely supported by the growth of shariah-compliant funds. conventional funds saw a marginal increase of 0.005% during the period while islamic funds recorded an increase of 44%, albeit starting from a lower base. according to pheim asset management sdn bhd founder and ceo dr tan chong koay, the new inflows mainly come from the employees provident funds members investment scheme (epf-mis), which allows malaysian citizens to allocate a part of their retirement savings to unit trust funds. we believe the size of the epf portfolio will grow going forward. the challenge for the unit trust industry is how to expand the pie by attracting more inflows from non-epf sources, he says. industry players have identified ways and growth areas to attract new investments into unit trust funds that could be beneficial to both the public and investment community. one way is to lower the fees charged by unit trusts, says hoo. given the rising cost of living, investing may be less of a priority for most families in malaysia. we feel that reducing the cost of investing in unit trusts will provide a more sustainable solution [for the industry], he says. the 5% sales charge of local unit trusts is one of the highest in southeast asia. while the fee is negotiable and can be lowered to 3%, it is still high compared with the 1% to 2% charged by unit trust funds in singapore. it is known that high sales charges are one of the reasons a large number of actively managed unit trust funds underperform their benchmark. this has prompted investors to explore alternatives such as etfs. meanwhile, the sc launched the islamic fund and wealth management blueprint early this year, mapping out the road for malaysia to become a global islamic finance hub. a key focus of the blueprint is to provide that push for the industry to offer a full spectrum of shariah-compliant wealth investment products and services. it is estimated that more than 80% of muslim individuals are currently investing in non-islamic products. thus, this is a huge potential market for fund houses to tap, says kafs gan. those seeking shariah-compliant investments, which are more conservative and less volatile, will have more choices in terms of asset classes and strategies going forward. besides that, new asset classes and investment strategies, such as private equity unit trust funds, are expected to be offered more widely by fund houses to cater for investors with different risk appetites, says eastsprings yap. essentially, products that can fill the gaps in the

management: staying ahead of the curve", "article": "  the wealth management landscape is entering a new abnormal. slow economic growth, low and negative interest rates, unprecedented geopolitical events and monetary policies have made it tougher for investors to get returns from traditional asset classes such as equities and bonds. the challenging environment is expected to persist. while citi analysts forecast that the global economy will grow 2.8% this year from 2.5% last year, global growth is weighed down structurally by lower productivity, slower population growth and limited room for further monetary easing. with the higher valuations in a number of asset classes, it will get harder for investors to diversify their portfolios and obtain returns. however, traditional asset classes will still be able to provide investors with attractive risk-adjusted returns despite the challenges, says florence tan, head of advisory, strategy and multi-channel communications at citi. as the policy focus shifts to one with less monetary accommodation and potentially increased fiscal spending, the fundamentals for different markets, sectors and asset classes will diverge. as correlations fall, there will be room for active managers to add value to portfolios. investors may also need to take on more risk to achieve higher returns, she says. citi analysts are currently overweight on us high-yield bonds. they note that us high-yield senior bank loans are offering attractive coupons, which can adjust to any change in the short-term rates. these loans also rank higher in the capital structure. tan says the winners and losers this year are likely to emerge from the changing political and policy landscape, which will allow equity long-short strategies to outperform. in this environment, it is imperative for fund managers to deliver consistent returns within a reasonable time horizon to stay ahead, says affin hwang asset management bhd managing director teng chee wai. whether they invest in equities, fixed income or a blend of both, investors want their money to work hard for them and get returns. it is up to the fund managers to ensure this by navigating a very sharp and short cycle in all these markets. that is why i believe an unconstrained approach is key, he says. in an unconstrained space, fund managers will not be inhibited by indices, giving them latitude and the ability to seek out best ideas and prices, says teng. this will provide investors and fund managers with an unbenchmarked view to potentially get the best returns. for example, you may have a huge business stock that is not doing well, but you are still holding it because it is in an index  you say that you need the exposure despite the fact that it is underperforming. however, adopting the unconstrained approach will allow managers to tell themselves that the companies are not performing and the fundamental outlook has deteriorated, so there is no need to invest in them, he says. later, you will be able to look for the next best ideas in the market and invest in them. there is absolutely no reason to invest if the companies are not doing well. affin hwang asset management first adopted this approach 17 years ago and will continue to do so in the current scenario, says teng. when i explained this concept to investors back then, the level of acceptance was not there. they told me that the way to invest is to know and track the benchmark. but i think that the way to invest is to find the best stocks, and provide the best possible returns  it is as simple as that  rather than just tracking the benchmark and giving excuses when the markets are down. this has been proved by our track record and i believe it will continue to prevail going forward. the low-yield environment is not the only significant challenge faced by the wealth management industry. many disruptions have taken place in the industry, including rising demand from a savvier generation of investors and advancements in technology, particularly with the emergence of financial technology (fintech) players. the most notable change driven by these disruptions is the increased democratisation of assets. lower entry points have been made possible for assets and products that were previously only accessible to affluent clients, such as private equity and alternative investments. patrick chang, chief investment officer at cimb-principal asset management, says the traditional investment strategies implemented by fund managers are still relevant as the wealth management landscape continues to evolve with new entrants on board. the entry of new technology-based companies usually offer low-cost etfs or index funds  for example, country or sector-based  which are suitable for tactical asset allocation. therefore, investors who adopt a core-satellite asset allocation strategy, which is a hybrid of strategic and tactical allocations, can take advantage of both traditional asset managers and new disruptive technologies to optimise their potential returns, he says. the emergence of the millennial client base, which has been dubbed the next wealth generator, has been shaking things up in the wealth management industry. the smartphone generation was born into technology and entered the workforce after the global financial crisis. they prefer a proactive approach to managing and investing wealth by using effortless channels such as mobile and web-based apps. this, however, will not cause the wealth management industry to lose its significance, says chang. the emergence of a large millennial client base, which is typically more tech-savvy and tech-inclined, will quicken the digitisation of investment services. however, the role of advisory and investment services remains highly relevant for more sophisticated and tactical solutions. this is particularly true in a volatile market.  as the market is facing headwinds and moving towards product homogeneity, what will it take for wealth management players to stay ahead of the curve? tan says in an effort to be on the cutting edge, citi continually accesses its investment businesses around the world to source for new products and services that help clients meet their financial goals in a changing global environment. the group also continually assesses the relevance of the investment strategies it implements in its businesses when offering product solutions, she says. for example, while asian investors are still largely income-oriented, given the low interest rate environment, investors in other geographical areas may be more interested in inflation hedges or currency diversification. when citigold relationship managers recommend product solutions to customers, they also take into account their financial goals and portfolios. chang says staying ahead of the curve requires continuous acquisition of investment skillsets, strong product propositions and efficient distribution models. at cimb-principal, we continue to find ways to improve and strengthen our investment capabilities and processes. for instance, we are developing our own in-house capabilities on quantamental investing, which is a hybrid of quantitative research and traditional fundamental analysis. these issues and strategies will be discussed at the edge citigold wealth

{"date_posted": "2/3/2017", "title": "cover story: charting umws road ahead", "article": "  hiving off its oil and gas division is just the first step in the groups growth strategy to return to profitability. president and group ceo badrul feisal abdul rahim hopes to start with a clean slate but the path to recovery may not be plain sailing, say analysts. it has not been an easy 16 months for badrul feisal abdul rahim since he took over as umw holdings bhds president and group ceo on oct 1, 2015. just months into his tenure, he had the dubious honour of presenting the groups worst full-year financial results since 1998. for the financial year ended dec 31, 2015 (fy2015), umw posted a net loss of rm37.2 million on revenue of rm14.44 billion as lower income from its automotive division was exacerbated by widening losses in its oil and gas (o&g) operations. it was umws first full-year loss in 17 years, and the night got darker in fy2016, his first full year as ceo, badrul tells the edge. umw is set to release its fy2016 numbers on feb 27. yes, 2016 is going to be a bad year. we are expecting losses and i think we will see a new low [compared with 2015], he says, adding though that he sees dawn ahead. the most important thing is that we are on the right track to recovery from 2017 onwards. for the nine-month period up to sept 30, 2016, umw posted a revenue of rm7.9 billion, down 22.9% from the previous corresponding period. its cumulative net loss stood at rm322.2 million compared with a net profit of rm930.7 million the year before. disposing of its listed o&g arm, umw oil & gas bhd (umwog), is the first step in the groups road to recovery as it refocuses on its remaining three core divisions  automotive, equipment, and manufacturing and engineering. on jan 19, umw announced that it would exit umwog, passing on its 55.72% stake to its shareholders via a distribution-in-specie pending their approval via an extraordinary general meeting to be held at end-march or in early april. for perspective, had it not been for the combined pre-tax loss of rm834.5 million from its o&g operation in fy2015, umws pre-tax income would have been roughly rm1.1 billion. this may explain the markets enthusiastic response to the news of the disposal. on jan 20, the day after the announcement, umws shares surged 9.96% to end at rm5.08. it was the stocks biggest single-day gain since august 1999. to recap, the divestment is part of a consolidation exercise that centres on umwog. also on jan 20, umwog and ekuiti nasional bhd (ekuinas) signed two separate share purchase agreements that were collectively worth rm721.61 million. the deals will see umwog acquire ekuinas 42.3% direct stake in listed icon offshore bhd for new umwog shares while separately acquiring ekuinas 95.5% stake in privately held orkim sdn bhd for cash. these exercises will see icon offshore being taken private. alongside its exit from umwog, umw is also in the midst of exiting its 16 non-listed o&g businesses, which badrul expects to be completed by next year. umw had ventured into o&g in 2002. the group is finalising its evaluation of the impairments needed for these o&g operations for fy2016 but it declined to specify their carrying value. our job now is to recover as much value [from the non-listed o&g businesses] either via exit or selling the assets. we will evaluate them and if there is a need to impair, we will impair, says badrul. we are going to start with a clean slate as far as 2017 is concerned.  tough road still if all goes according to plan, umw would only be booking its share of losses from umwog for another two financial quarters at most for fy2017, badrul adds. offloading the o&g operation will also pare some rm4.5 billion off umws debt, reducing its gearing significantly. moving forward, the growth strategy is to increase shareholders value through sustainable long-term investments, says badrul, adding that the plan is to be focused on the three core businesses that we have, given the companys limited resources. analysts agree that the exercise will bring umw an immediate upside. in a report following the jan 19 announcement, cimb research expressed positive surprise, saying the exercise will remove a big drag on group earnings and better reflect growth prospects from other core businesses. umws bottom line can easily swing into profit post-disposal of umwog, says midf research in a jan 20 note. more importantly, its balance sheet is expected to improve significantly  gearing is expected to more than halve while total borrowings will reduce by 67% based on fy15 statements. however, the road ahead will not be easy as umw still has to contend with challenges in its other businesses, for example its automotive division, long a primary earnings contributor  it accounted for 74% of revenue in fy2015. the division saw pre-tax income fall 41.6% year on year in fy2015 as revenue also fell. the decline was due to intense competition in the malaysian automotive market while the ringgits depreciation against the us dollar shrank margins, umw said. going into 2017, the outlook has not improved for this segment, according to kenanga research. the near-term outlook for the automotive segment remains soft, evident from perodua and toyotas weaker combined sales of 251,000 units in fy2016 compared with 278,000 in fy2015. moving forward, we estimate flattish growth in combined sales to 254,000 units in fy2017, dragged by higher marketing operating costs, higher import costs on unfavourable currency fluctuations and lacklustre demand. we continue to believe margins will remain subdued, says the research house. meanwhile, umws equipment division  which distributes heavy equipment and industrial machinery across malaysia, singapore, brunei, papua new guinea and myanmar  saw slowing growth in fy2015 as pre-tax income inched up 3.8% year on year. the groups manufacturing and engineering division, which is the worlds largest distributor of repsol lubricants outside spain and which recently ventured into fan case manufacturing for rolls-royce, is still quite small, contributing just rm16.8 million to pre-tax earnings in fy2015. badrul, however, seems unperturbed. he tells the edge that the groups strategy to grow all three divisions centres on a long-term perspective and not short-term gyrations in the market. i believe that in the next 10 to 25 years, there will be more cycles and downtrends in the automotive, equipment or even manufacturing and engineering segments, says badrul. but if we take a long-term view, we know we will stay [in the game].  automotive driving growth a major part of umws growth strategy is to grow its overall revenue by up to 15% over the next 5 to 10 years, according to badrul. taking into account the groups fy2015 revenue of rm13.2 billion (less o&g contribution), achieving this goal would theoretically mean reaching a new revenue high of rm15.2 billion in 10 years time. badrul acknowledges that it would not be easy. a big part of that growth in the short term would have to come from the automotive division, a challenging prospect given its already high base amid the current soft market outlook. after a record total industry volume (tiv) of 666,677 units sold in 2015, the local automotive market saw a 13% drop in 2016 to 580,124 units. of this number, umw lays claim to 272,220 units sold via perodua and toyota models, representing a market share of 47%. a card up umws sleeve is its upcoming second toyota production plant in bukit raja, in which it has invested rm1.8 billion. slated to be ready by the fourth quarter of 2018, the plants annual capacity will be around 50,000 units initially and may later be ramped up to 100,000 units. the plant will boost umws efficiency and capacity significantly, according to ta research earlier this month. in a report following a visit to the new plant, the research house opines that the new plant is necessary and long overdue for the group, given that the older plant  built in 1968  is running below optimal utilisation due to slower toyota sales. according to badrul, the plant should be fully up and running by 2019 after allowing some time to commission machines and equipment. among others, the increased efficiency will allow more competitive pricing against umws competitors, he says. while local tiv slumped in 2016, he thinks there is light at the end of the tunnel. badrul cites the malaysian automotive associations tiv forecast of 590,000 units for 2017, an expected 1.7% improvement. there is still demand out there, even though it is stabilising at around 580,000 to 590,000 units (per annum), he says. hopefully, we can still sell and even conquer the majority of the 590,000 tiv. part of the drive to increase the groups market share will be an expected new toyota model to be unveiled by the second half of 2017, badrul adds. of course, continuation of aggressive promotional campaigns and more innovative strategies by car companies are needed to boost sales in this tougher economic situation. while the automotive division will likely remain the anchor of umws earnings for the foreseeable future, reducing its reliance on this segment is also part of the groups agenda going forward. we aspire to have a balanced portfolio of 50% contribution from automotive and 50% from our other divisions in the long term, says badrul, adding though that it is unlikely that umws reliance on the division will be drastically reduced in the near future, given that it is also pursuing growth in the segment. that said, it is likely that the equipment and manufacturing and engineering divisions will outpace the automotive divisions growth rate given their lower bases, he says. as for the equipment division, its strong base in malaysia and singapore with market-leading positions necessitates looking beyond those countries for further growth. umw is studying potential new markets regionally, such as laos and cambodia, although it is still in initial talks with its principals. badrul says the strategy is to take a long-term view of 10 to 15 years to gauge whether a potential market will be moving upwards in terms of infrastructure development, which would boost the prospects for equipment suppliers such as umw. from that perspective, umw is looking at southeast asian countries that are booming in terms of domestic growth. laos, cambodia and even thailand are growing well today, says badrul, adding that there are some opportunities and we will look at them. in addition, umw is looking to reposition its existing equipment operations, shifting its focus from resource-based sectors such as plantations to construction in order to cater for urbanised industries. prospects in umws sights are putrajayas massive infrastructure projects announced in recent years, touted to be worth rm550 billion collectively over the next two decades. some of the mega projects include the mass rapid transit lines, the pan borneo highway and the high-speed rail linking kuala lumpur to singapore. even if you get a small portion of that [estimated gross development value], its already a huge market, says badrul. we are also evaluating some opportunities in industrial equipment leasing, in terms of the pros and cons. in the manufacturing and engineering division, badrul is optimistic about the groups upcoming single-source tier-1 rolls-royce plant, which will begin operations in october this year. the plant, which cost rm750 million, will produce fan cases for rolls-royce under a 25-year agreement that will be used for the boeing 787 dreamliner and airbus a330neo. we will produce a single-digit number of fan cases this year, move to two digits in 2018 and to three digits in 2019, says badrul. the plant will start contributing positively [to earnings] in 2019 and we are looking at manufacturing and engineering being one of the core contributors to the groups bottom line in 2020. while badrul declined to disclose the expected contribution from the plant, he says it will be significant to the manufacturing and engineering segment. if all goes well, the plant will be umws launch pad to further high-value, high-margin manufacturing opportunities. airbus, for example, reportedly had a backlog of orders worth us$1 trillion as at end-2016. there is a huge opportunity there, says badrul. that said, he is wary of umw getting too far ahead in terms of manufacturing and engineering diversification. for now, the focus is getting the fan case manufacturing plant up and running smoothly. i have told the team to focus on rolls-royce right now, make sure they deliver and deliver it right and at the right quality. then, if there are any other

f&b retailers (issue 765, feb 6, f&b plays look pricey, but some are showing rebounding earnings), we are adding old chang kee to the singapore market portfolio. the homegrown snacks chain is best known for its signature curry puffs, first sold from a small stall in a coffee shop on mackenzie road. the company has parlayed its 61-year-old heritage into an international brand. it has more than 80 outlets in singapore and nine overseas, spread out across australia, indonesia and malaysia. as it embarks on its next phase of growth, old chang kee is ramping up manufacturing capacity to meet rising demand for its products. the company recently completed two new facilities: one in woodlands and another in iskandar malaysia. reconstruction work at the companys original factory facility in woodlands will be completed in june and subsequently fully integrated with the adjacent new factory. with the new facilities poised to come online in the coming months, old chang kee is well positioned to expand its product line, achieve economies of scale and widen its margins. the companys potential has attracted the attention of phillip capital, which initiated coverage of the stock last november. the integrated factory is expected to increase capacity by 60%, from 50,000 puffs a day to 80,000 puffs a day, says phillip analyst soh lin sin. the additional production space, which will almost double, will also provide additional capacity for its product innovations. for fy2016 ended march, old chang kee reported a 3.1% increase in revenue to s$73.9 million, but earnings declined 5.9% to s$5 million. the groups gross margin increased to 63.1% from 62.4%, thanks to tighter cost control over raw material costs and an improvement in product mix. however, the bottom line was affected by higher staff costs and higher outlet rental expenses. depreciation and amortisation also increased because of the renovation of the factory at woodlands, new equipment for the factory and new enterprise resource planning software. the companys most recent set of results shows some improvement, though. for 2qfy17 ended sept 30, 2016, old chang kee posted a 30.5% jump in earnings to s$1.6 million. the company appears to be benefiting from economies of scale. revenue rose 5.9% to s$20.5 million from a year ago, owing to contributions from new outlets and higher sales volumes at existing ones. revenue from other services, such as delivery and catering, rose as well, thanks to higher sales generated from its factory in malaysia. phillips soh is bullish about the companys growth prospects. we expect earnings to grow [at an] 8.9% compound annual growth rate over the next three years, writes soh. earnings for fy2018 are expected to surge 29% versus fy2016. old chang kee has declared an interim dividend of 1.5 cents a share for 2qfy17, representing a yield of 3.7%. it paid out total dividends of six cents in fy2016, including a one-off special dividend of three cents. with its strong balance sheet and steady cash flows, the company is in a good position to maintain its generous payouts. it has generated average free cash flows of s$2.5 million a year over the past three years. for the six months to sept 30, the group generated positive operating cash flow of $4.8 million and free cash flow of s$2.1 million. shareholders can also look forward to higher payouts in the years ahead, says phillips soh. after the completion of its factory reconstruction project in 1qfy2018, we expect no significant capital expenditure. thus, we believe the growing free cash flow from fy2018f onwards could lead to a higher dividend payout of four cents in fy2019, says soh. shares in old chang kee are down 1.8% this year, versus a 6.7% gain in the sti. if the company manages to execute its growth plans, the stock could see a rebound in the months ahead. latest portfolio moves our portfolio, which started on jan 5, is now holding 43,400 shares in ap oil international,

karex bhd\n(feb 10, rm2.39)maintain add with a lower target price (tp) of rm2.65: karex bhd is set to release its second quarter of financial year 2017 (2qfy17) results on feb 24. in our view, 2qfy17 net profit should come in sequentially stronger at rm10 million to rm15 million. however, this is a sharp year-on-year (y-o-y) decline from a high base in the second quarter of 2016 (2qfy16). note that there was strong strengthening of the us dollar and drop in latex prices in 2qfy16. on the bright side, we think 2qfy17s revenue and gross profit margins should also improve q-o-q from better sales volume, especially in tender markers, and additional foreign exchange gains. karex will begin to market its own brand manufacturer (obm) products in one of the uks largest retail chains focusing on health and beauty products. this will be piloted via pasante, acquired in late-may 2016. this development is a positive surprise, escalating the groups obm segment faster than expected, especially into the european markets. nevertheless, revenue contribution from this foray should be minimal in the near term as we expect the early quantities to be limited while additional one-off costs will offset bulk of initial gains. the 22% year-to-date (ytd) surge in latex prices has raised concerns as latex cost accounts for some 24% of karexs total operating cost. however, management gave assurance that the group has hedged forward a significant portion of its latex needs up to mid-march 2017. we note that the group has increased the average selling prices of its products recently, and may continue to do so depending on latex prices. however, there would be a time lag as any price revisions due to latex price hikes will only be reflected after four to six months. given the latest operational updates, we lower our forecast fy17 (fy17f) to fy19f earnings per share (eps) by 0.9% to 9.5%. this is to account for the recent spike in latex prices, as we increase our latex costs estimates to rm5.50 per kg for fy17f to fy19f from rm4.25 per kg previously. furthermore, the earlier-than-expected foray into a uk retail chain would also result in higher administration and marketing expenses such as listing fees, additional workforce and increase in logistics costs to cater for this new venture. our eps revision lowers our tp to rm2.65, still based on an unchanged 29 times its 2018 cumulative forecast price-earnings ratio. we continue to like the groups long-term prospects, especially its transformation into a formidable obm player, and its unparalleled lead in the tender markets. although near-term numbers may face headwinds from higher marketing and raw material costs, we view any share price dips as opportunities to accumulate the stock. risks to our add call are a stronger ringgit and higher latex prices.  cimb research, feb 10"}, "198": {"date_posted": "8/2/2017", "title": "sia met earnings forecast so why arent analysts more upbeat about the stock?", "article": " singapore (feb 8): singapore airlines core earnings for 3q17 rose 12% y-o-y to s$256 million, after excluding a s$79 million impairment charge on the value of the tigerair brand arising from the merger between tigerair and scoot. (see also: singapore airlines 3q earnings fall 36% to $177.2 mil) the results were boosted by the outstanding performance at sia cargo, where operating profits rose by s$50 million to s$53 million during the quarter, on the back of higher air freight demand between asia and europe and on the transpacific routes. in fact, uob kay hian pointed out that this was the cargo operations highest quarterly earnings in nine years. however, at least four brokerages  uob kay hian, dbs vickers securities, maybank kim eng, and cimb securities  are maintaining their neutral stance on sia with morgan stanley maintaining an underweight rating with a price target of s$8.96. ubs has a buy rating with a target price of s$9.81. why is this so? cimbs analyst raymond yap points out that the increase in air freight demand coincided with an increase in ocean freight demand and could be due to the restocking for the early lunar new year in 2017. that demand, yap said, may not last. on the other hand, mohshin aziz, analyst at maybank kim eng, noted that sia cargos earnings jump merely masked over the underlying weakness in the airlines overall business where passenger yields had fallen in all of its business segments. yields were distinctively weak owing to intense competition and overcapacity, [and] costs were in order thanks to lower fuel hedging losses and productivity gains, says aziz, adding that sias nine-month core earnings of s$457 million achieved just 69% of its full year estimates. maybank kim eng has a price target of s$9.70 for sia. dbs group researchs analyst paul yong agreed, and is forecasting sluggish growth in operating profits over the coming quarters amid the weak demand environment and higher non-fuel related expenses. while sia has enjoyed lower fuel costs in the last few quarters, lower revenue as a result of lower yields (for both the core sia passenger and cargo segments) and higher non-fuel costs such as maintenance, repair and overhaul (mro) and staff costs have eaten into these savings, explains yong in a note on wednesday. dbs has a price target of s$10.10 for the stock. in fact, cimbs yap believes the low-cost carrier business is not without its own set of troubles. scoot has delivered stronger y-o-y earnings for at least the past two years, as the delivery of its b787s led to aggressive cost-efficient expansion, coinciding with low oil prices and the decommissioning of aged 777-200s, he says in his note on wednesday. however, for the first time ever, scoots 3q revenue per available seat km (rask) fell by more than its cost per available seat km (cask), burdened as it were by 50% y-o-y available seat km (ask) expansion over the past four quarters, by promotional fares necessitated by its recent entry into india and by the negative impact of demonetisation in india. yap concedes sia has continued to invest in its longer term business, by refurbishing its lounges, installing premium economy seats on all of its 777-300er planes, and launching a new premium product for five of its a380s that will be delivered over the next two years. the group is also expected to relaunch direct flights to the us and complete the brand merger between scoot and tigerair within the year. however, yap continues to be pessimistic about the airlines fortunes. these far-sighted initiatives keep sia competitive against its peers, but the road ahead is tough. only a major global recovery can lift earnings from current depressed levels. cimb has a price target of s$10.50 for sia. furthermore, uob kay hians k ajith noted that the group has entered into a longer-dated brent hedge, hedging 33% to 39% of its fuel requirements at between us$53 to us$59 per barrel until 2022. these are attractive levels but will likely result in substantial forward commitments, which could affect dividend payout, says ajith who has a target of s$10.10. the key lies in the growing competition in the long haul market and the budget consciousness of its customers, according to maybanks aziz. sias misfortunes are due to market overcrowding on its key markets. this is structural in nature and despite managements best efforts; they dont seem to have an answer for it. it is very likely that the current mid single-digit net profit margins and return on equity is what sia could hope for in the future. that said, its best to avoid sia for other airlines with superior financial returns, he concludes. shares in sia are trading at s$9.91 on wednesday."}, "199": {"date_posted": "8/2/2017", "title": "gamuda at the sweet spot of

contracts reinforces gamuda bhds position as among the likely biggest beneficiaries of this segment over the medium to longer term. much improved job replenishment visibility is underpinned by our estimated rm41 billion total addressable tenders for rail tunnelling projects. a key driver of this is the mrt 3 circle line, which is still being studied. chances of gamuda exceeding our rm2 billion assumed new wins this year remain good. its internal rm3 billion-to-rm4 billion job replenishment target comprises larger-value rail contracts (lrt 3 and the china-led gemas-jb double tracking) and a portion of the pan borneo highway in sabah, which is likely to be accelerated in conjunction with the impending general elections based on our market strategy and outlook, could occur in the second half of 2017 at the earliest. in our best case, there is 20% to 30% upside to its rm8.9 billion order book. with a healthy order book revenue cover of 4.4 times, we expect the momentum of construction earnings in the first quarter of financial year 2017 (1qfy17) to be sustained in the coming quarters. physical work progress for mrt 2 stood at some 2% as at end-2016 and we forecast the progress billings to hit a reasonable 20% mark by end-2017. we have assumed a blended construction pre-tax margin of 9%, which could rise to 10% to 11% within the next 2 years, similar to the peak of the previous mrt 1, as jobs go full swing. the perceived overhang on the stock arising from the long-delayed sale of 40%-owned splash (water asset) could slowly diminish in the coming months. the april target for a new deal and price tag for splash now points to the possibility of a special dividend, in our view, as the company has no immediate major capital expenditure plans. our sensitivity analysis based on a hypothetical rm1.1 billion share of proceeds shows that the combined dividend yield could be 7% if at least 50% of the cash is set aside as special dividends. the potential revival of construction plays and investors preference for big-cap infrastructure laggards could trigger a recovery in gamudas foreign shareholding, which stands at a low of 22%. this is unjustified, in our view, given the improved job outlook, greater conviction of the cash-enhancing splash deal and new job opportunities from the rm55 billion east coast rail line, rm50 billion high speed rail, rm40 billion mrt 3 and potential new overseas rail tunnelling jobs. gamuda remains our top pick among the big caps in view of the above potential medium-term catalysts. our tp remains pegged at a 10% revalued net asset valuation discount and implies 19% upside. we maintain our earnings per share forecasts for fy17 to fy19. key downside risks are delays in job roll-out and the splash deal.  cimb

bhd, from having to recall its ternolol 50mg film-coated tablets due to wrong labelling to the subsequent revocation of the licences of both its manufacturing plants by the national pharmaceutical regulatory agency (npra). the cancellation of the licences followed an audit by the npra, which deemed the pharmaceutical companys current good manufacturing practice (cgmp) unacceptable and decided that its pharmaceutical quality system did not comply with the latest cgmp requirements. however, hovid has been allowed to sell its existing inventory. this means its other products are deemed to be safe for consumption, which is probably the companys saving grace. still, these events have not gone down well with investors. the pharmaceutical companys shares succumbed to heavy selling after the announcement of the revocation. the stock slid to 28.5 sen on jan 11  its lowest level since september 2013. the company had alerted the investing public that there would be negative impact from the loss of its manufacturing licences. it estimated that turnover per share would fall by 4.63 sen and earnings per share would decline by 0.33 sen. in its financial year ended june 30, 2016, hovid posted a net profit of rm17.89 million compared with rm20.9 million the year before. the drop in earnings was due mainly to lower foreign exchange gains. also, there was a one-off gain on divestment in fy2015. meanwhile, eps dropped to 2.24 sen from 2.73 sen previously. although hovids share price recovered to 30 sen last thursday, it was still trading at a two-year low. based on the companys market capitalisation of only rm240 million, some quarters opine that the pharmaceutical company looks attractive as an acquisition target at this juncture, when the ringgit is weak. managing director and chairman david ho sue san is hovids single largest shareholder with a 33.8% stake. hovids plant in ipoh is currently undergoing expansion, which will increase its capacity to manufacture tablets and capsules by 30%. the second phase of the facilitys expansion is expected to be completed by this year. the new facility has been designed to meet the pharmaceutical production standards of europe, the us fda (food and drug administration) and the australian tga (therapeutic goods administration). apart from meeting the anticipated higher demand for our products, this new facility will increase our presence in australia, europe and the us in the future, says hovid in its 2016 annual report. when fully commissioned, the plant would be able to handle the anticipated growth in orders for tablets and capsules in the next three to five years. hovid has an r&d centre in bayan lepas, penang, which the company says will help improve its ability to expand its product portfolio. furthermore, the pharmaceutical company has obtained 56 product licences overseas in recent times, including in brunei, the philippines, laos, uganda, myanmar, cambodia, oman, ivory coast, vietnam, hong kong and nigeria. another factor that could make hovid an appealing takeover target is that ho is 67 years old and that his children are not keen to take over the family business. according to hovids 2016 annual report, only hos second daughter, sarah ho lee-mun, is in a key management role as the head of sales and marketing at the pharmaceutical company. nevertheless, analysts who track the stock do not see hovid as an attractive takeover target. there has been no indication of this from management. i dont think its likely, says one. things have been tough for hovid in the last five years or so. in 2010, it slipped into pn17 status due to a disclaimer opinion expressed by its auditor on its financial statement for fy2010. this came on the back of biofuel producer carotech bhd defaulting on certain loans. carotech, which also earned a disclaimer opinion from the auditor, was seen as a significant hovid subsidiary. within a day of the pn17 classification, hovids share price had slipped 27%. however, the company managed to lift itself out of pn17 status by jan 17, 2012, after paring its stake in carotech from 58% to less than 20%, implying that the biofuel producer was merely an investment for it. this gave hovids share price a leg-up and it slowly regained its momentum. fast-forward to the present time, and some think the licence revocation of hovids manufacturing facilities and the recall of its ternolol tablet will not have a significant impact on it. i dont think hovids reputation for its generic medication will be affected much as this is sold through doctors and hospitals. end consumers would not be aware of the situation at hovid. but the question is, what if hovid does not have enough supply to sell? asks a fund manager. according to a report by cimb research, the companys inventory for the local market can only last for two to three months while its overseas inventory is for less than a month. in a filing with bursa malaysia, hovid says it will submit corrective actions to the npra by the end of the month and invite the agency to audit its facilities immediately after that. if all goes well, it expects the re-issuance of its manufacturing licences by end-march and for production to recommence by april 1.

dollar strength with an unchanged target price of rm5.65: we recently brought top glove corp bhd to visit investors in thailand, during our asean corporate day. the response to the meetings was good, as top glove met a total of 15 analysts and fund managers. the company remains bullish about prospects going forward, which supports our view that the worst should be over for the stock and the company should record sequentially stronger earnings ahead. top glove has highlighted that the operating environment has improved with the recent appreciation of the us dollar-ringgit post-trump victory. furthermore, the demand for gloves has remained robust as the total utilisation rate stands at between 82% and 85%. another key highlight was the price revisions it implemented in the first quarter of financial year 2017 (1qfy17). the ability to raise prices while utilisation rates have remained healthy signifies that pricing competition has eased. the group raised latex gloves average selling prices (asps) by an estimated 10% to 13% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) in 1qfy17, while we estimate it raised nitrile gloves asps by 4% to 5%. despite the favourable us dollar-ringgit benefitting the group, it is positive that the group is able to raise its asps to pass on the recent increase in raw material prices (latex increased 34% q-o-q, nitrile butadiene increased 26% q-o-q). however, management did not discount the possibility of further asp hikes given the spike in latex prices this week. overall, we believe the latex prices at current levels are unsustainable despite the upcoming wintering period (february to april). as the spike in latex prices can be attributed to a supply shortage due to floods in southern thailand, the supply is expected to improve going forward with reports of the floods subsiding. furthermore, speculative demand from a spike in china car sales is unlikely to continue into 2017, as china recently lowered tax cuts for vehicle purchases to 5% from 10% in 2016. it also touched upon its expansion plans in 2017. it plans to add 6.2 billion per annum (12% increase) in capacity this year. although this looks aggressive at this juncture, management has highlighted plans to stagger the new incoming capacity to allow for better supply and demand dynamics. we understand that its 4.4 billion plant (due april 2017) is expected to come onboard throughout the whole year. on the other hand, the commercial production of phase 1 of f31 (1.4 billion per annum) can potentially be deferred to 1q18. managements comments during the meetings supported our positive view on the stock. we continue to like top glove as a key beneficiary of the stronger us dollar-ringgit and a pickup in demand for malaysian glove exports. the key risks to our view are sharp weakening of us dollar-ringgit and stronger pricing competition.  cimbresearch, jan 20"}, "208": {"date_posted": "20/1/2017", "title": "cimb thai sees fy16 loss as a blip, plans 5.51b

returning to profitability this year, helped by its board of directors' guidance and continued support from parent cimb group holdings bhd, said its president and chief executive officer kittiphun anutarasoti. for one, cimb thai plans to raise 5.51 billion baht from a rights issue, which involves an offer of 5.51 billion new shares, to boost its capital position and balance sheet to support business growth. the 93.71%-owned subsidiary of cimb group posted a net loss of 629.53 million baht or 0.03 baht loss per share in fy16 compared with a net profit of 1.05 billion baht or 0.05 baht per share the previous year. in a statement today, cimb thai attributed the fy16 loss to a 66.6% increase in provisions mainly from rising non-performing loans (npls) in isolated commodities-related industries during the year, as well as a general increase arising from the gradual pace of the economic recovery. the bank's net interest income rose 16.4% to 9.87 billion baht in fy16 from 8.48 billion baht in fy15, resulting from a 21.8% decrease in interest expenses. the cost to income ratio also improved to 57.4% in fy16 compared with 58.3% in 2015 as a result of better cost management and increased income. net interest margin over earning assets stood at 3.77% in fy16 from 3.27% in fy15, thanks to more efficient funding cost management. as at dec 31, 2016, total gross loans (inclusive of loans guaranteed by other banks and loans to financial institutions) stood at 206.4 billion baht, up 3.7% from a year ago. gross npl stood at 12.7 billion baht, with an equivalent gross npl ratio of 6.1%. this is an increase from 3.1% as at dec 31, 2015 due to slower repayment ability from borrowers in certain sizeable corporate accounts. \"taking into consideration the npl sale completed in early january 2017, cimb thai's pro forma gross npl ratio and loan loss coverage ratio as at dec 31, 2016 would be 4.8% and 86.4% respectively,\" said cimb thai. meanwhile, the rights offer, approved by its board yesterday, will raise the bank's equity capital 22% to 15.14 billion baht, according to cimb thai. under the offer, cimb thai's shareholders can apply for two rights shares for every nine existing cimb thai shares at one baht a share. the bank will call an extraordinary shareholders meeting to seek approval for the plan on feb 24. kittiphun said at the end of last year, the bank's bank of international settlement (bis) ratio and tier-1 capital at 16.1% and 10.7% respectively were well above regulatory requirement. \"with the proposed rights offering, our bis ratio will strengthen to 18.5%  thus further reinforcing the bank's capital position and balance sheet going into 2017,\" he added. kittiphun also noted that the bank's strategic priorities for 2017 are anchored on the 5 c's  customer, culture, compliance, cost and capital  and targets a modest loan growth of 5u201310% amid a recovering economy. \"given the gradual pace of economic recovery in

(its stake has since come down to 17.69%.) in the first nine months of fy2016, affin hwang ib made a net profit of rm67.2 million, an increase over the rm43.7 million it made in the same period a year ago. the am business accounted for rm45.6 million of affin hwang ibs profit before tax of rm90.9 million, while the investment bank business contributed around the same, or rm45.3 million. a banking analyst that tracks affin says the aborted deal has a neutral impact on the group. i dont think investors had priced in a lot of upside from this deal, given that there was no immediate value that daiwa would have brought to the table with capital markets being soft. had the deal panned out, it would have been neutral-to-slightly-positive for affin as it would have a strong partner that could bring in capital, the analyst tells the edge. affins shares gained three sen to close at rm2.40 last wednesday, the day it announced the deal was off. it ended last week slightly lower at rm2.39. interestingly, this is the second deal in less than three months to have fallen through in the banking sector. on nov 4 last year, hong leong financial group bhd said it could not reach an acceptable commercial agreement with bank negara-approved negotiating parties for the divestment of hong leong assurance bhd and hong leong msig takaful bhd. in its march 14, 2016 issue, the edge reported that affin hwang ib was valued at a healthy price-to-book (pb) multiple of between 1.45 and 1.6 times under the proposed deal. this compares with the pb multiple of 1.28 times that affin was subject to when it acquired hwangdbs investment bank  which now forms part of affin hwang ib  in 2014. the high premium daiwa was willing to pay for a minority stake, in what was to be an all-cash deal, suggests that it had larger plans for affin hwang ib. daiwa has been looking to acquire minority stakes in brokerage firms in asia to generate more income from abroad. although this outcome is clearly disappointing for both affin and daiwa, both of our groups have committed to continuing our efforts to build upon the strong relationship that we have developed since first entering into a business alliance in december 2013, and our companies will continue to work closely with one another on other collaboration opportunities, affin said in an internal circular sighted by the edge. affin, controlled by lembaga tabung angkatan tentera, has long had a history of partnering foreign companies for its entities. affin itself is 23.5%-owned by bank of east asia ltd from hong kong.

a result of lower sales volume, sector revenue fell 13.8% in 2016. it also took a big hit from the depreciation of the ringgit against the us dollar and yen, given most of the cost components such as the imported completely built-up model and completely knocked-down kit components are derived in foreign currencies. we expect the sector to post a core net loss of rm350 million in our 2016 forecast

expect national-brand volumes to grow by 4% to 5%, while foreign-brand volumes drop by 1% to 2% in 2017. we expect consumer sentiment to stay weak at least until the second half of 2017 (2h17) given the uncertainty in the domestic economy amid currency volatility. hence, we believe that consumers may continue to delay their big ticket item purchases until the later part of this year. we expect local brands to regain market share in 2017 on the back of renewed consumer interest after five new model launches by proton and perodua in 2h16. proton is also expected to benefit from the 2017 budget allocation as the government is planning to subsidise rm4,000 in proton iriz down payment for first-time car buyers. we maintain our underweight call on the sector due to the persistent

proven track record in the industry, excellent balance sheet, a stronger us dollar and an expected earnings growth riding on nike, magni-tech could just entice investors to give it a second thought for 2017 after being overlooked for most of 2016.  by billy toh  classic scenic bhd classic scenic bhd, the wooden picture frame manufacturer, is the classic dividend play for 2017 with its above market average dividend yield of about 7%, and might be the right defensive strategy amid the uncertain external environment. last year, its share price performance was impressive with a total return of 59.8%, closing at rm1.79 on the last trading day of 2016. whats even more remarkable is that despite such an uptrend, its dividend yield for 2016 was above market average at 6.7%. the group saw its revenue rise 22.7% year-on-year to rm14 million for the third quarter ended sept 30, 2016, while net profit grew 87.5% to rm3.2 million. its gross profit margin also rose to 43.9% from 38.2% a year ago. the company is primarily involved in the manufacturing and export of high-end wooden picture framework mouldings and about 90% of its sales come from the export market, mainly to the us and is denominated in us dollars. the stronger us dollar has contributed to its improved financial results. its net cash also saw a significant increase to rm28.7 million or 23.9 sen per share from rm21.4 million in 2015. the company operates six manufacturing factories and is in the midst of building a new warehouse to improve its production efficiency and capacity. insiderasia has noted some of the positive characteristics of classic scenic, such as its profitable niche market, owner-oriented management, high sustainable dividend yield and growth potential.  by billy toh  gamuda bhd gamuda bhd has significant upside due to its strong outstanding order book of rm9 billion, supported by the mmc-gamuda joint venture which secured the rm15.5 billion mass rapid transit (mrt) line 2 underground works package in march 2016, according to ta securities. we expect close to rm500 million of project development partner (pdp) fee to flow directly to profit before tax throughout the implementation of [the] mrt line 2, the research house said in a report. other catalysts include gamudas works package for pan borneo highway worth rm1.57 billion and the appointment of srs consortium, in which gamuda has a 60% stake, as the pdp for the penang transport master plan (ptmp). ta securities has estimated that the alternative proposal adopted by the penang state government has a projected value of rm40 billion, with works targeted to commence in 2018. the potential sale of gamudas 40% stake in the syarikat pengeluar air sungai selangor water supply concession should provide the funding for its ptmp project, said affinhwang capital. shares in gamuda have a 12-month target price of rm5.46 according to consensus estimates. of the 23 analysts covering the company, 18 have rated a buy call on the stock, while three have a hold call. bloomberg data projects a 7.05% growth in earnings per share (eps) for the construction player for its financial year ending july 31, 2017 and a further 13.17% eps growth for the following year.  by samantha ho  sime darby bhd sime darby bhd, which recently saw tan sri abdul wahid omar take up the helm of its controlling shareholder, permodalan nasional bhd (pnb), is set to benefit from a proposed corporate restructuring exercises. the expectation is that [wahid] will unlock value [via] restructuring, a head of research said. pnb had a 52.98% stake in sime darby as at nov 30, 2016, according to the groups website. sime darby was also highlighted as one of cimb researchs big cap picks in their strategy note on dec 2. we expect the share price to rerate on potential plans to unlock value and better earnings prospects in view of the higher crude palm oil and coal prices in the future quarters, cimb research said. shares in sime darby have shot up from an opening price of rm8.10 this year to rm8.55 at market close last friday, suggesting investors had already begun pricing in expectations on the stock.  by samantha ho  genting malaysia bhd genting malaysia bhd has been touted as a darling of the gaming industry for 2017 on expectations that the genting integrated tourism plan (gitp) will boost its earnings and improve market sentiment due to the legalisation of casino operations in japan. research houses have pointed to expected higher visitor growth as the main catalyst for the stock in light of the full launch of the first phase of the gitp by end-2017, which includes the opening of the 20th century fox theme park. the consensus 12-month target price for genting malaysia is rm5.13 based on estimates by 17 out of 23 investors. the stock was last traded at rm4.73, edging up from its 2017 opening price of rm4.58. fourteen analysts have placed a buy call on the stock, while seven have recommended to hold. according to consensus estimates by bloomberg, the group is expected to see a growth in its earnings per share by 13.2% for its financial year ending dec 31, 2017. revenue is also expected to post growth of 9.35% and 9.3% by end-2017 and end-2018 respectively. in the current quarter, the group is expected to complete the launches of sky avenue and sky plaza, which have been fully tenanted at premium rental rates of rm20 per sq ft, according to maybank kim engs strategy report dated dec 19. the weaker ringgit is also expected to be a pull factor for chinese tourists, whose arrivals had been trending upwards by 26% in the cumulative first eight months of 2016, maybank kim eng said.  by samantha ho  ta ann holdings bhd after a year of lacklustre performance, sarawak-based ta ann holdings bhd is set to benefit from the improved demand for timber as well as the turnaround in the plantation sector. the company has been chosen by kenanga research, affinhwang capital and public investment bank research as their stock picks for 2017 in their latest strategy reports. kaf investment bank chief investment officer gan kong yik likes ta ann as he is upbeat about the plantation sector in 2017 with crude palm oil (cpo) price expected to be firmer. furthermore, the demand for timber is anticipated to increase in 2017. another plus point for ta ann is that it is seen as a beneficiary from the stronger us dollar. in a strategy note dated jan 4, kenanga research expects ta ann to be a double beneficiary of the sharp cpo price appreciation, as well as stronger us dollar as the company exports nearly all of its timber products, and sales are denominated in us dollars while costs are entirely in ringgit terms. it also likes ta ann for its sector-leading dividend yield of 3.8% against the average 2.4%. the consensus 12-month target price for ta ann is at rm4.38. six out of nine research houses covering the stock have given it a buy call. the integrated timber producer did not perform well in 2016, falling 5.5% over the past year, underperforming the benchmark fbm klci, which declined by 3%.  by yimie yong  sapurakencana petroleum bhd integrated oil and gas (o&g) services provider sapurakencana petroleum bhd is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the oil production cut pledge between opec and non-opec members. the deal is expected to start a cyclical recovery for the o&g sector and sapurakencana is viewed as a good proxy to ride on the gradual recovery of the sector. several research houses have upgraded their call on the o&g sector recently, after opec and non-opec members pledged to cut production. chosen as one of the stock picks for 2017 by public investment bank research, the research house said the worst is likely behind for sapurakencana. given its ability to undertake comprehensive scope of works across the o&g suite, sapurakencana is said to stand in a better position against its peers on expected recovery in o&g activities. maybank ib research has pointed out that sapurakencana is a proxy to a rising oil price play and monetising its gas assets is a major catalyst. the counter is one of its key buys in the sector. kenanga research has recently upgraded sapurakencana to an outperform call with a target price of rm1.88, following the rerating on the selective upstream players in view of the sustainability of oil prices above us$50 (rm236) per barrel. bloomberg data shows that there are five research houses with a buy call on the stock, and 12 with a hold call. recall that the counter fell by nearly 20% in 2016 and has plummeted by almost 63% in the last three years.  by yimie yong  bumi armada bhd bumi armada bhd, which saw its share price fall more than 40%, may provide another opportunity for investors in anticipation of improving sentiment and operating outlook of the oil and gas sector. ta investment management bhd executive director choo swee kee pointed out that bumi armada shares were oversold in the past two years and expected there would be strong earnings growth for its floating production storage and offloading (fpso) business. bumi armada is one of our top picks for 2017. moving forward, we think there will be stronger earnings growth for the fpso. we also like earnings generated from the fpso as they are seen as more stable, he told the edge financial daily. bumi armada is one of the worlds largest fpso players. public investment bank, which has a buy call on the counter, expects to see a boost in earnings from four major fpso & floating gas solutions (fgs) contributions in 2017, according to its note dated nov 24, 2016. bumi armada posted a net loss of rm96.71 milion in the third quarter ended sept 30, 2016 (3qfy16) versus a net profit of rm70 million a year earlier, on lower revenue. revenue fell 33% to rm377.51 million in 3qfy16 from rm559.46 million in 3qfy15, as it saw lower income from fgs and fpso operations. despite weaker earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) level, uob kay hian said it had assessed that there was no cause for concern as bumi armada was still well within the allowable range for loan covenant on net debt/ebitda.  by yimie yong  protasco bhd protasco bhd is one of the construction players that are expected to benefit from an early general election in 2017. the well-established player in the construction industry is focused on road maintenance works, where most of them are based on concessions awarded by state and federal governments, providing the company with a steady income stream. with the heightened expectation of the 14th general election happening in 2017, there is a potential for extra emergency road maintenance works to be carried out, according to kenanga research. protasco has an outstanding order book of about rm4.4 billion for its maintenance concessions, which could last for about 10 years, contributing about rm400 million to its revenue yearly. looking forward, protasco is eyeing more sizeable concessions, which could potentially contribute another rm100 million to rm200 million to its top-line. for its construction division, management is targeting a replenishment of about rm500 million for the financial year ending dec 31, 2017 that comprises infrastructure and government housing projects such as perumahan penjawat awam 1malaysia (ppa1m). protasco has a strong track record with ppa1m project, in which the company has bagged two phases of ppa1m worth rm900 million. besides a steady income stream, the group also has a decent dividend yield of about 5.6%, far superior in comparison with other small- to mid-cap construction players with an average of 2.9%.  by billy toh"}, "216": {"date_posted": "6/1/2017", "title": "a decade later, this singapore rigyard operators a tad wiser", "article": " singapore (jan 6): cimb is upgrading sembcorp marine to add from hold with higher s$1.70 target price after lifting the impairment discount on its brazilian yard. key catalysts for the stock include the delivery of more rigs and higher than expected order wins. in a thursday note, analyst lim siew khee says the arrival of the hull of p-68, petrobras fpso vessel, at sembmarines jurong aracruz yard in brazil for integration could just be whats needed to kick-start activity in the yard and remove that impairment risk. in 2012, sembmarine had secured the modules construction and integration for p-68/p-71 for us$674 million (s$965 million). it has completed about 30% of the modules with steady payment from petrobras. recently, oro negro has also finalised an agreement with pemex to extend the charters for five of its existing jack-up rigs, albeit at a lower rate of us$116,300/day from us$130,000/day. this included the contract resumption of two units that were suspended for 12 months. the rigs were contracted at u$211 million in 2013 but with profit reversed in 2015. this spells hope for delivery of the three completed oro negro jack-ups, says lim. while lim is predicting order wins of s$1.5 billion for the year and s$2 billion for 2018 on orders for fixed platform and fpso projects, higher oil prices could nudge contract award pace. in 9m16, sembmarine only announced about s$320 million of orders. order book excluding sete brasil stood at s$5.2 billion. to be sure, sembmarine has gained valuable experience in the past 10 years, says lim. these include speculators risks, capex risks and financing risks. we believe all of these issues have been priced in and largely provided for. sembmarine is also more cautious in financing customers, with milestone and progressive payment terms enforced, says lim. shares of sembmarine are up 3 singapore cents at s$1.485."}, "217": {"date_posted": "5/1/2017", "title": "cover story: top 12 stock picks for 2017", "article": "  as the year draws to a close, many can now heave a sigh of relief  the equity market has proved to be a challenging beast to tame even for the most seasoned investor. however, the relief will be short-lived as uncertainty remains the buzzword in the coming year. fund managers and analysts are already expecting several world events next year that will cause more uncertainty. indisputably, incoming us president donald trumps foreign and trade policies will be closely monitored by the investing community, which is waiting to see if he will fulfil his policy pledges to make america great again. apart from that, there are also the elections that will be held in several european countries next year. some fear that the voice of the anti-eu may prevail as member countries continue to suffer years of high unemployment and tepid growth. maybank investment bank research highlights the risk of more aggressive us federal reserve rate hikes as a result of higher inflation and growth expectations from fiscal expansion plans in the us. this will, in turn, widen the monetary divergence between the us and the other major economies, especially with the european central bank having extended its quantitative easing to end-2017, it says in a recent report. on the home front, some have singled out the 14th general election as a factor that could add uncertainty to the local stock market. however, those who believe in an election rally are expecting the polls to get the bulls charging in. to recap, prime minister datuk seri najib razak hinted at the recent umno general assembly that the 14th general election could come anytime soon. despite the events that could cause market jitters next year, fund managers believe that there are still bright spots. plantation is one sector that is starting to look interesting again. this is due to the unexpected rebound in crude palm oil (cpo) prices this year. year to date, they have risen 36.14% to rm3,123 per tonne, the highest since july 2012. at the peak in 2010, it was rm3,619 per tonne. according to inter-pacific securities head of research pong teng siew, this is a good time for cpo as prices tend to move up between november and march because of low output. maybank ib research says in a note that it expects cpo prices to start the year on a high but foresees a correction in the second quarter before hitting the bottom in the third when production reaches its peak. the research house says the average selling price forecast for 2017 is rm2,400 per tonne. plantation is a long-term play. look out for planters with young trees because that is where you will see growth in output, says phillip capital management chief investment officer ang kok heng. construction is another sector worth watching. with massive infrastructure development taking place, such as the mass rapid transit project and pan-borneo highway, and more projects to be implemented over the next two years, construction players are bound to benefit from them. significant projects slated for the next two years include the east coast rail line, kuala lumpur-singapore high-speed rail, light rail transit line 3, gemas-johor baru double tracking and the remaining work for mass rapid transit lines 2 and 3. there is also the rm30 billion melaka gateway trading port, a joint venture by state-funded kaj development sdn bhd and china-based conglomerate powerchina international group ltd. we like pure construction players. there are a lot of contracts not rolled out yet. furthermore, the weakness in the ringgit will not affect many of these players as they can source their raw materials locally, says ang. etiqa insurance and takaful head of research chris eng prefers smaller construction players but cautions that some companies profit margins may be thin despite securing jobs. meanwhile, the agreement between the oil producing nations and the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec) to cut production is expected to rebalance demand and supply of crude oil and provide some reprieve to oil prices. maybank ib research, which has upgraded the sector to positive, believes that it is a good time to bottom fish as the sector has seen the bottom, with most stocks having lost much of their value. the sector is due for a cyclical recovery, on improving sentiment and operating outlook. we see further rerating prospects should saudi aramcos investment of a 50% stake in petronas rapid (refinery and petrochemical integrated development) project materialise, it says. crude oil aside, the weaker ringgit has also continued to provide opportunity for export-oriented counters. ang opines that the soft currency has made malaysian exports more competitive. this bodes well for the export-oriented companies as well as those catering for both the local and foreign markets. yes, export-oriented counters have benefited from [favourable] foreign exchange, but that is only a short-term gain. i believe that there is demand for malaysian goods and they have become more competitive with the weaker ringgit. companies with own-brand products should find themselves on a better footing, he says. etiqas eng says investors should try to buy now and sell by april or may next year, given that most of the closely followed global events will take place in the middle of the year. yes, there are definitely more uncertainties next year compared with 2016.  tenaga nasional despite posting a commendable 10% y-o-y gain in core net profit to rm7.7 billion in its financial year ended aug 31, 2016 (fy2016), tnbs share price has been on a downward trend. at its close of rm13.74 last thursday, the stock had lost 6.52% from its all-time high of rm14.67, recorded in the middle of the year. however, it was still 6.31% higher y-o-y. at this level, tnb is valued only at 10.53 times earnings. a report by ta securities points out that this is one standard deviation away from the groups historical (since 2000) average of 17.1 times. the weakness in tnbs share price is indicative of selling by foreign funds, given the recent depreciation of the ringgit. however, it is important to note that there appears to be plenty of demand for tnbs shares. recall that khazanah nasional bhd placed out a 1.5% block of tnb shares at rm14.30 apiece earlier this year. moving forward, tnb is one of the few blue chips that near-guarantee stable earnings despite the increasingly volatile economic landscape. after all, under the new imbalance cost pass-through mechanism, all variations in fuel costs are passed on to consumers. hence, neither a recovery in coal prices nor further depreciation of the ringgit should have a sizeable impact on tnbs earnings. this resilience makes tnb one of the few defensive stocks that funds can rely on and it is definitely worth more than 10.53 times earnings. nonetheless, the recent trend of awarding power projects to industry newcomers may cap some of the earnings growth over the next few years.  by ben shane lim   gadang holdings the construction and property developer has lost some of its lustre by becoming selective about its new jobs. its net profit fell 20% y-o-y to rm16.7 million in the first quarter ended aug 31. but of more concern is the 60% y-o-y drop in construction revenue during the quarter as its jobs wound up. it does not help that gadangs tender book, which stood at rm10 billion at the start of the year, has fallen to rm5.2 billion. but that is not necessarily a bad thing. its management has always taken a conservative approach to bidding for work, preferring to avoid projects with low margins that cannot justify the risks. gadang does not need to bag many projects, just the best ones. with mrt2 now in full swing, gadang is expected to secure a package, given its performance in constructing viaducts for the first line. a single package would boost the groups order book by rm1 billion. meanwhile, there is the 37km-long lrt3 that gadang is also bidding for. at last thursdays close of rm1.01, the company is valued at 6.51 times earnings, making it one of the cheapest construction stocks on the market. the average earnings multiple in the sector is 14 times. beyond construction, gadang has a sizeable property development arm. this year, the group became development partner for the 24.08-acre kwasa damansara township that has an estimated gross development value (gdv) of rm700 million. this is expected to start contributing to earnings in 2018.  by ben shane lim  kerjaya prospek group a relatively new name on investors radar screens, the company is the product of a backdoor listing by datuk tee eng ho. the bulk of its construction business worth rm438 million was injected into it at the beginning of the year. it also came with an order book of rm2.7 billion and a profit guarantee of rm150 million over three years up to fy2018 ending dec 31. based on its closing price of rm2.08 last thursday, kerjaya prospek had a market capitalisation of rm1 billion, valuing it at 11.55 times earnings. the companys adjusted earnings per share for the year is estimated at 18 sen. kerjaya prospek is not a mere asset injection. this year, it managed to replenish its order book with rm1.5 billion worth of jobs, boosting the outstanding amount to rm2.89 billion and improving its earnings visibility. the company should be able to continue to fill its order book, thanks to the projects of its existing clientele, such as s p setia bhds setia sky seputeh (gdv: rm950 million) and eastern & oriental bhds puro place (gdv: rm800 million), notes kenanga research in a report. kerjaya prospek is also attractive for its cash-rich balance sheet, which is uncommon among its peers. the company still has a cash balance of rm109 million after paying a four sen per share dividend this year, which works out to cash per share of 21.4 sen.  by ben shane lim   sarawak oil palms sops forward price-earnings ratio (per) of 15.42 times is undemanding, especially compared to the average 2017 forecast per of 19 times of its mid-cap peers. the planters proposal to fully acquire shin yang oil palm sdn bhd for rm873 million in july would add 47,000ha of plantation land to its land bank, of which 23,798ha are planted with oil palm and 6,772ha are unplanted. the average tree age in shin yang oil palms plantations is seven years, which would reduce the average age of sops trees to 10.1 years post-acquisition from 11.1 years at present. it is worth noting that shin yang oil palm is being acquired from sops major shareholder, shin yang holding sdn bhd. we believe the young age profile of the acquisition and maturing area of about 2,200ha between 2017 and 2019 should contribute to above-average fresh fruit bunch growth from fy2017e onwards, says kenanga research in an october report. to fund the acquisition, the planter issued 128 million renounceable rights shares on the basis of two for every seven sop shares held. the rights issue was priced at rm2.80 apiece, below sops market price. despite a rebound in crude palm oil prices, sop lagged behind its peers. at its close of rm3.71 last wednesday, the stock had declined 8.65% year to date.  by esther lee   tsh resources the mid-cap planter was among those that suffered from the effects of el niu00f1o this year. nevertheless, analysts are expecting production to improve going forward. for the cumulative nine months ended sept 30, tsh resources recorded a net profit of rm81.6 million after stripping out foreign exchange gains and other exceptional items. about 80% of its revenue and profit is derived from its plantation business while the remaining 20% comes from its wood-product manufacturing and bio-integration divisions. it is worth noting that tsh resources crude palm oil extraction rate is 21%, above the industry average of 20.46%. its fresh fruit bunch yield is high at 24.7% per hectare compared with the industry average of 18.48% while its average tree age is young at eight years. the planter has 67,853ha of unplanted land, which should sustain its growth over the next 10 to 14 years, says bimb securities research. tsh resources has proposed to privatise its listed but loss-making subsidiary, ekowood international bhd, in which it holds a 67.46% stake. analysts believe the privatisation will have negligible impact on the planters shareholders. at its closing price of rm1.87 last thursday, the stock had lost 2.55% year to date.  by esther lee   mkh based on a 2017 price-earnings ratio forecast of 6.65 times, the plantation and property player is a steal for investors, especially since it is expecting the earnings of its plantation division to double next year on the back of stronger crude palm oil prices and better yields. the trees in mkhs 15,400ha plantation in kalimantan, indonesia, are expected to reach the peak of maturity next year. according to alliancedbs research, the estate is expected to achieve a yield of 29 tonnes per hectare, which the research house deems impressive, given the average tree age of seven years. the company plans to purchase 2,000ha of plantation land near its existing estate in indonesia for rm15 million. this would increase its plantation area to about 18,000ha. as of now, the companys largest contributing segment is still its property division, which accounts for 70% of its revenue. mkh has not been spared the effects of a soft property market. however, its focus on providing affordable homes resulted in unbilled sales of rm827.5 million as at sept 30, which should keep the group going for 1u00bd years. the company has a sizeable land bank in the kajang/semenyih corridor, which will see it benefit from the completion of the mrt lines next year. mkh recently proposed a cash call followed by a bonus issue. closing at rm2.86 last thursday, the stock had gained 34.47% year to date. by esther lee   samchem holdings in contrast to the general trend of disappointing corporate results, samchems earnings are back on the growth path. it posted a net profit of rm11.48 million for the nine months ended sept 30, 2016, up 48% from the previous corresponding period, while revenue grew 8.3% to rm483.7 million. its management is confident of sustainable earnings growth, thanks to rising demand for petrochemicals in asean, especially vietnam and indonesia, where manufacturing plants are sprouting up. sales volume is growing 30% to 40%. the [growth] pattern is likely to continue, if not become stronger, its ceo, datuk ng lian poh, told the edge in an interview. according to him, selling prices have also stabilised. the homegrown speciality petrochemicals distributor has a foothold in malaysia, indonesia and vietnam. with a market capitalisation of rm130 million, it evolved into a leading player in asean after the consolidation of the regional industry in recent years. ng believes there are exciting prospects for the petrochemicals industry in vietnam and indonesia. however, samchem is not just targeting these two countries but the whole of asean with its 450 million population. demand for petrochemicals usually grows in tandem with increasing affluence. given its current scale, samchem forms part of the supply chain of many mncs that have manufacturing facilities in the region. furthermore, the high barriers to entry are advantageous to the company. samchems earnings per share for 9mfy2016 was 8.44 sen. based on an annualised eps of 11.25 sen, the stock is trading at 11.28 times.  by kathy fong   hong leong industries at its closing price of rm9.38 last thursday, the companys share price had gained 65.8% year to date. however, it was trading at a low 2017 price-earnings ratio forecast of 10.95 times. hl industries has two core businesses  the manufacturing and selling of fibre cement and concrete roofing products under its hume brand and the more exciting business of manufacturing and trading yamaha motorcycles in malaysia and vietnam through its 24% associate stake in yamaha motor vietnam co ltd. thanks to vietnams fast-growing economy, many feel hl industries is facing exciting days ahead. after all, the country has a young population of over 90 million, the vast majority of whom use motorcycles as their primary mode of transport. in its first quarter ended sept 30, the company registered year-on-year revenue growth of 9%, attributable to strong sales of motorcycles and ceramic tiles. net profit surged 44.5% to rm64.77 million on higher contribution from motorcycle sales. hl industries vietnam associate contributed rm30.7 million to earnings. in fact, hl industries net profit in fy2016 jumped 42.7% year on year to rm247.22 million due to a higher contribution from its vietnam associate. kenanga research says in a report that the companys yamaha motorcycles are enjoying increasing demand in vietnam as a result of effective marketing strategies. currently, yahama motorcycles command a quarter of the vietnamese market while honda dominates 70% of it.  by esther lee   kawan food well known for its frozen paratha, the company saw its earnings climb in its latest two quarters after a dip in the first quarter. for the cumulative nine months ended sept 30, its revenue increased to rm144.3 million, up 15.6% from a year ago, as it saw higher sales across all regions, save for europe, while net profit registered a 2.8% growth to rm25.79 million. more than 60% of kawan foods sales is derived from its export markets. the company has a strong following in the us, which accounted for 34% of its sales in the last nine months of its financial year. cimb research says in a report that steady sales in the domestic market also suggest that the frozen food manufacturers local business has recovered from the impact of the goods and services tax. as at sept 30, kawan food had a cash pile of rm67.58 million, and it declared a special dividend of 3.5 sen per share in november. this was on top of a 2.5 sen per share interim dividend that was announced in its third quarter results. at a 2017 price-earnings ratio forecast of 29.92 times, many would consider kawan foods valuation lofty. however, the potential of better sales in its export markets, given that malaysian exports have become more competitive with the weakening ringgit, could be a reason to give kawan food a second look.  by esther lee   e.a. technique (m) it may not be hard to fathom why this oil and gas stock had tumbled nearly 47% year to date as at last thursday. the prolonged industry downturn saw it slip from its peak of rm1.46 in august last year to a record low of 45 sen at end-november. it bounced back to 59 sen last thursday but was still trading below its 2014 initial public offering price of 65 sen. some fund managers opine that the counter has been oversold, given its high earnings visibility compared with its peers in the oil and gas industry. but its management must be puzzled at the selling pressure on the stock, although the company receives steady recurring income from its long-term charters. e.a. technique managing director datuk abdul hak md amin told the edge that it was business as usual at the company despite the oil rout. we are less affected by the downturn in the oil and gas industry because our clients are mainly in the mid and downstream segments, such as petrochemical companies and refineries, he said, adding that the utilisation of the companys fleet of vessels was more than 90%. furthermore, its vessels are chartered for transporting products, like gasoline and methanol, in the region. thus, the risk of contract termination is low because the demand for such materials remains steady. for the nine months ended sept 30, the company posted a higher net profit of rm30.49 million, or 6.05 sen per share, against rm26.19 million, or 5.2 sen per share, a year ago. in the meantime, the new vessels coming on stream with charters are expected to boost its earnings.  by kathy fong   eg industries the kedah-based company is a growth stock despite the current harsh economic climate. a new substantial shareholder brought change to the company, enabling it to climb the value chain by providing box-building and reap the benefits. box-building refers to end-to-end manufacturing services that start at designing and end at the shipping of the completed products to end users. eg industries has graduated from being just an original equipment manufacturer. it now serves world-renowned electrical and electronic brand names in several industries, including consumer electronics, ict, medical, automotive and telecommunications. in fy2016 ended june 30, eg industries posted a pre-tax profit of rm19.7 million, down from rm23.63 million the year before. however, it had booked a disposal gain of rm15.38 million in fy2015. excluding the extraordinary gain, the groups pre-tax profit would have been rm8.24 million that year. the companys growth momentum continued in its 1qfy2017, with pre-tax profit rising 41.6% year on year to rm7.14 million. we like eg industries for its gradual transition into a vertically integrated ems (electronic manufacturing service) player through its continuous expansion into the higher margin, full-assembly services segment, and its projected three-year core earnings cagr of 40%, says uob-kay hian. the research house sees the companys net profit ballooning to rm30.6 million, or 11.4 sen per share, in fy2017 and rm36.7 million, or 13.6 sen per share, in fy2018. eg industries share price was hovering in a tight range of 80 sen to 90 sen for most of the year.  by kathy fong   kimlun corp the johor-based company has been a beneficiary of the property boom in the state. while having been involved in a large number of residential projects, kimlun has also taken on infrastructure jobs in johor. however, it has risen to prominence for manufacturing segmental box girders for the mrt project under its manufacturing division. at its near-record-high closing price of rm2.14 last thursday, kimluns share price had surged 56% year to date. however, its valuation, at 8.23 times earnings, is still not stretched. in the nine months ended sept 30, the companys net profit rose 17% year on year to rm57.7 million. interestingly, revenue fell 14%, primarily due to lower contributions from the construction segment. the fall was compensated for by higher margins. kimlun bagged rm1.1 billion of new construction jobs this year (compared with rm700 million in fy2015), boosting the groups order book to rm1.93 billion. its manufacturing segment, meanwhile, saw its orders double to rm300 million, driven by a rm200 million contract to supply segmental box girders for mrt2, which was awarded in march. moving forward, the group is expected to bag the contract to supply tunnel lining segments for mrt2 as well. kimlun also supplies pre-cast concrete products to singapore. it is diversifying its offerings, now also supplying singapore with rail sleepers and parapet walls. as a result, the company has benefited from the weaker ringgit. kimlun has paid dividends consistently and is expected to declare a dividend of 6.8 sen this year, for a yield of 3.27%. at the same time, the group has

rm1.63)\ninitiate add call with a lower target price of rm1.87: sapurakencana petroleum bhd is the product of the merger of sapuracrest petroleum bhd and kencana petroleum bhd in 2012, which brought together the drilling rig, pipe-laying and subsea construction businesses on one side, and yard fabrication business on the other. subsequent to the merger, sapurakencana expanded its tender drilling rig business by purchasing seadrill ltds assets in 2013, and then purchased newfield malaysia holding incs oil and gas (o&g) blocks in 2014. the result is an o&g giant in the local context, with tentacles across the entire value chain. sapurakencanas energy business is currently producing from legacy oil blocks in peninsular malaysia at a loss, based on spot oil prices. but when gas from the sk310 b15 block starts producing from late financial year 2018 forecast (fy18f), and gas from sk408 begins flowing from late fy19f, we expect sapurakencana energy inc to enjoy a major uplift in profits. gas from these two blocks are sweet and relatively inexpensive to develop, while petroleum nasional bhd is a keen buyer and willing to sign lucrative gas sales agreements with the wellhead suppliers, in our view. sapurakencana drilling asia ltd (skd) has a 50% market share in the global tender drilling rig business. tender rigs offer a niche drilling solution, unlike the more popular jack-up rigs. as such, there are only 30 tender rigs available for charter globally, and only eight competitors of skd. speculative new building orders have been few and fleet growth is limited. these dynamics have kept skds earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation margins high at 40% to 50%, and although we have projected net losses for skd in the next few years, we believe they will be manageable to the group as a whole. we believe sapurakencana won rm3.8 billion in new engineering and construction (e&c) contracts in the nine months of 2016, from feb 1 to oct 31, slightly more than the revenue recognised in the period, keeping its e&c order book from depleting. in our view, this is no small feat given the reduced willingness by oil majors to spend and pricing pressures. separately, the brazil pipe-laying support vessel joint venture continues to do well, with an almost 100% technical utilisation and charters paid on time. sapurakencana achieved core net profit in excess of rm1 billion in the three years to fy16, as a result of the order book accumulated prior to the oil price downturn. but we expect fy17f net profit to fall, and medium-term net profit to remain depressed, as the higher-margin order book is depleted. street estimates appear to be too bullish, in our view. given the weak earnings outlook, the stock has already lost around 70% of its value since peaking in late 2013 and appears to have reached a valley in the past six months, in our view, suggesting that the bad news is already in the price. with planned action by the opec and non-opec nations to curtail oil output from jan 1, 2017, we think sentiment could improve as higher oil prices benefit sapurakencana directly via its energy output, and indirectly by way of a possible improvement in drilling and subsea construction asset utilisation.  cimb research, dec 21"}, "220": {"date_posted": "6/12/2016", "title": "cimb looks ahead: chips are rolling in for genting

[so] i dont expect the bank to be impacted too badly [now] despite the decline in the economy, says lodin. it is not like 1997 [when] we were among the worst-hit because of our huge exposure to some of the big corporate groups. in terms of asset quality, affin holdings gross impaired loans stood at 1.98% as at june 30, lower than that of its larger peers, such as cimb (3.2%) and rhb bank (2.06%), and higher than that of ammb holdings (1.69%) and public bank (0.52%). nonetheless, affin holdings earnings improved in the first six months ended june 30, 2016 (1hfy2016). its profit margin widened with revenue growing 2.9% year on year to rm903.64 million and net profit surging 49.3% to rm252.96 million. the banking group attributed the improved results to lower allowance for loan impairment, higher net interest income and better performance of its islamic banking division, among others. however, the higher earnings have done little to prop up affin holdings share price, which is hovering at a five-year low. the stock has dropped almost 7% year to date and is trading at half its book value, which stood at rm4.42 on june 30. while saddened by the stocks undervaluation, lodin notes that other local banks are in the same boat. it is unfortunate that the market price today does not reflect the true value of the stock but we believe there will be recovery [in the valuation], he says. according to kenanga researchs valuation in early september, affin holdings price-to-book ratio of 0.5 times was the lowest among those of its peers, which ranged from 0.8 to 2.4 times at the time. some analysts attribute the banking groups better 1hfy2016 results to a strong 1qfy2016, which offset the margin squeeze seen in 2qfy2016. naturally, they are sceptical that affin holdings can sustain its financial performance over the longer term. of the eight research houses covering the banking group, four have a sell call on it and two have a buy. that said, banking stocks generally fall out of favour when the economic climate is harsh and capital requirements increase. on whether there will be another round of consolidation in the banking sector, lodin says he does not feel there will be much pressure from the government or bank negara malaysia this time around. he believes market forces will determine the number of banks to operate in the country. it all depends on whether you [as an investor] have the stamina to hold on to your investment and whether you can sustain yourself over the medium to long term. these will be the two factors that determine if we are going to have five, six or eight banks. moving forward, lodin says affin holdings will focus on innovations in the financial technology (fintech) sector, which he believes is where the future of banking lies. we cannot run away from the digital economy. that will come. it may take 5 to 10 years, and it will make the bank more efficient. but the issue here is that some bankers will lose their jobs. another frontier for affin holdings is chinas islamic banking potential, says lodin, adding however that the move is on hold now because chinese regulators have not opened up to islamic banking yet. in 2010, reports said affin holdings and its 23.5% shareholder, the bank of east asia ltd (bea), had submitted a proposal to open chinas first islamic bank. bea chairman and ceo david k p li was quoted as saying that the china banking regulation authority was studying the proposal. once the chinese allow foreign islamic banks to operate in their country, then bea and affin can work together to tap the markets advantages, says lodin. bea is a fantastic partner to have u2026 we understand each other very well. bea holds a 23.5% stake in affin holdings. however, banking analysts say a move into china is unlikely to happen in the near term. one says china is an obvious choice in the region, alongside indonesia, for islamic banking expansion but it will not be easy. china may not have a proper islamic banking (framework) yet, says the analyst. so this [expansion] may take longer to materialise."}, "229": {"date_posted": "10/11/2016", "title": "cover story: 'not sentimental about assets'", "article": "  the edge: it seems to many that the group is selling assets to pay dividends to shareholders. what is your comment? lodin: no, we are not selling assets to pay dividends. it just so happened that the offer to purchase those assets came at a time when our performance was not exciting ... while i [had] made the commitment that we would declare dividends every quarter and at a certain amount. its just a coincidence that it happened when the market was down and revenue was also down. even during the good times, i would have done the same thing if the same offer had been made to me, for example, the purchase of the quarry land in kulai. the sale of 30% of the jendela hikmat project just came in last year. it came at the right time and it was an offer that i found difficult to refuse. i didnt have control by holding 30% and, at that price, i would be making so much profit compared to what i had paid to acquire it earlier on, so why not? so its not because [we needed] to pay the dividends ... because i also had the objective to reduce gearing. my target is 0.6 [times].  what is the timeline for the gearing target? it is 0.9 times now. the target is 0.6 times within the next 15 months to two years.  the dividend rate for lembaga tabung angkatan tentera (ltat) was 12% last year. will you be able to sustain that this year, and going forward? i hope so. but its tough going. the market is not that exciting and, in past years, we made decent profits from trading in the stock market. but [if] we look at the prices of blue chips such as maybank bhd and cimb group holdings, they have come down so much. there are very few counters that are doing well and its difficult for us to make a good profit from the stock market. so we have to depend more on dividends and other sources of contribution.  would you reconsider bousteads dividend policy if things do not improve as you expect? well, its not a policy statement but we have indicated to our shareholders that we will continue to declare at least 70% of our net profits. and we will honour that. early this year or late last year, it went up to 90%, i think. again, its a balance. if we dont need the money and the banks are not pressing for payment on some of the loans, then we will just give it to shareholders. they have been loyal to us and its right that we repay their loyalty in the form of good dividends. i hope to continue that policy, if possible u2026 to give back more. this [coming] quarterly payment, i think we will continue with that. sometimes, my finance director scratches his head [over this] and, unfortunately, hes got no more hair now (laughs). this is a commitment i made to my shareholders. we do not declare dividends on unrealised profit  that we do not do. its based on realised profit. some people, they do it through window dressing and all that, but we dont do that. there must be proper realisation of profit for us to declare dividends.  are you under pressure to declare dividends at the boustead level? well, not under pressure, no. but i would like to see [dividend payments] u2026 because it benefits me as a shareholder also. but ive got to be fair. just declaring dividends to fulfil my need to pay my interest or my principal, thats not fair. fair in the sense that we have excess money that we can give back to shareholders. and as ive said, its got to be related also to the gearing level. if we can maintain the gearing level at 0.6 [times] and weve got excess cash that enables me to declare 5% to 6% ... i would do it. so its a question of how you balance your cash flow, your profit and so on. the whole idea is that our operation must be carried out on a sustainable basis at every level, be it at revenue, profit, cash flow, gearing and so on.  do you think the high gearing is due to the overexpansion of the past few years? possibly, yes. not only that, cheap money [too]. why do i need to bother the shareholders when i can get loans at 4% to 5% with a return of 12% to 13%? so, its purely based on cost of funds. and im not sure if this will change much in the next six months unless the us federal reserves (janet) yellen raises interest rates. so why should you impose upon the shareholders when you can get cheap funds from the market? thats what weve been doing. but the project must be viable and be able to pay for itself, at least u2026 servicing the loans.  has any shareholder come up to you during annual general meetings and say, please keep this dividend money and use it to repay borrowings? no. i cant recall. theyre asking for more and more (laughs).  would it make sense to reduce the dividend payments for one or two years, bring down gearing and then raise them back to the normal level? i view every project undertaken by the group on a standalone basis, in the sense that the project must be able to support itself. and this includes determining what sort of borrowings level is required. and theyve got to incorporate it into the cost of funds. then only you can see the true viability of the project. but if theyre going to get easy money from the shareholders, then the proposal may be a bit misleading. i always work on the concept of setting the gearing at any level. but if you can do it on 100% gearing without support from the group, it is even better. so you are using the banks money to produce profit with no capital required from the group, which to me is probably the most interesting proposition to the group. the less [of the] groups money you use, the better it is. thats how we evaluate business proposals. but if you need the groups support, then it must be at the proportion of capital and borrowings.  what other assets do you plan to dispose of? i am not going to be sentimental about assets. if you come to me with a price at a multiple of book value, i am quite prepared to consider. it is a question of achieving the balance of having a strong cash flow and sustainability of revenue and profits. we are not desperate to sell assets. [if] a party comes and says, can we buy this piece of land  for example, where a bhp petrol station is located  from which it would take me 15 years to get returns and offers me something that i can earn overnight, i would say yes. we have done it at two or three stations.  so for the next one year, youll continue to dispose of assets and streamline your business? yes, its an ongoing process. disposing of non-core assets and streamlining our business is ongoing. i will not compromise on that. we [can] take on new business, but if after a certain period of time it does not generate the expected returns, then u2026 we have closed down about half a dozen [such businesses] over the past few years. i will not hesitate [to close]. no sentimentality. i give you four or five years, if [there are] no results, thank you very much. if its a joint venture, then we [will] back out. thats our strategy for the last five, ten years, and moving forward.  do you see affin in much better shape now compared with 1997/1998? much, much better. i was involved not only in 1997, but also 1984-85, when i first joined the board. when i first joined the board, it was horror stories all the way u2026 the abuse, mismanagement, the corrupt practices. but today, at the board level, as far as i can see, we have got the risk-management parameters in place, we have a good risk manager, a strong internal audit. on the board, we have a former federal court judge and people with strong corporate and legal backgrounds. so, it is a good combination. i dont expect the bank to be impacted too badly if there is a sudden decline in the economy. it is not like 1997, where we were among the worst hit because of our big exposure to some of the big corporates. the profile of borrowers is quite well spread now  corporates, individuals and so on.  has bank negara malaysia given approval for your reappointment as a non-independent and non-executive director of affin bank? we understand that you also hold board positions in other affin group companies, such as deputy chairman of affin holdings bhd and chairman of affin hwang asset management. have you obtained bank negaras approval for those too? the group is doing some restructuring. my reappointment to some of the board seats is presently being handled by affin holdings.  what is your view on what people have been saying regarding the next consolidation in the banking industry? we were chosen to be one of the banks. but moving forward, i dont think the government and regulator will want to interfere too much in terms of the number of banks that they want to see operating in this country. one thing is for sure, the number of banks will be determined by market forces. again, one of the elements or determining factors is capital. if you dont have the stamina to invest in the financial institution, if you dont have the patience to wait for the returns in the medium to long term, then probably you will not want to be a player in financial services. so, it has got to be based on whether you have the capacity or stamina to hold on to your investment, and whether you have the ability to sustain for the medium to long term. these are the two factors that will determine whether we are going to have five, six or eight banks. of course, under the financial services act, there is a requirement that individuals can only hold 10%, and institutions can hold up to 20%. at the moment, there is some flexibility.  does boustead have the stamina? yes, we would like to be in the banking group. it is unfortunate that the market price does not reflect the true value, but we believe that [the value] will recover. when the time comes, the value is going to reflect the situation.  so far, has anyone approached you [to buy a stake in affin bank]? not at 10 times book value. we have not made it known to the market that we are up for sale, and no one has approached us.  at the moment, you do not intend to sell? at the moment, no.  you wear many corporate hats. how do you handle those different positions? im very focused on how i conduct myself. if you go through the shareholding, youll find that its all under one group  ltat. ive been with ltat for 35 years. i like what i do there, and i think to some extent, i have contributed quite fairly to the returns that we give to the contributors  averaging about 11% per annum for the last 40 years. so, not bad lah. i didnt take anything from ltat when i decided to take over the position of managing director of boustead holdings u2026 that was in 1990. so even though im still ceo of ltat and boustead holdings is a part of ltat, i dont take anything from ltat in terms of salary and all that. ltat owns almost 60% of boustead. this is my bread and butter, so to speak. where i get money to buy milk for my children and my grandchildren and so on. and under boustead, we have all the other companies youve mentioned  pharmaniaga, bhpetrol, boustead heavy industries corp, boustead naval shipyard sdn bhd  and 20% of affin holdings, in which ltat owns 35%. theyre all related. in some, if not all, of these companies, i was involved in setting up, in listing, in acquiring and carrying out corporate exercises. so i do not want someone to come in and disturb the strategies and game plans that we have prepared or have adopted to ensure that these are all investments that can generate good returns for shareholders and ultimately to ltat and the armed forces personnel. so, the flow-through is very important, the synergy is very important. when we have companies within the same group moving in different directions, its not going to create value or unlock value for the ultimate shareholders. because of my understanding [of] and involvement [in the group] from day one, and due to my continued interest and commitment, i have accepted some of these positions. to me now, money is not the most important thing. its more about seeing through the harmonisation, unlocking of value and the production of results from our investments in all these activities. its just business activities, but all under one group, and the whole idea is to make sure they come up with the best possible returns.  it sounds like bousteads profit prospects are getting better, but why are you offloading your own shares? i dont take money from anywhere. all my money is either borrowed or earned from working here (laughs). its to pay back the bank. i sold a lot recently because bank of nova scotia was pressing for payment. its nothing, its just that they have scaled down their retail activity. they gave me one year, asked me to pay back the loan i took. they were very nice to me, so i said okay lah. i had no choice but to sell the shares even though the price was not very attractive ... it was below book value. ive got no other savings.  so it was not a reflection of what you thought about the groups prospects? no, far from it. and ive got a lot to spare in terms of shares, so why be greedy. recently, there was a rights issue. i had to give an undertaking to take up the rights issue. i did it through borrowed funds and i promised them id pay, so i sold [the shares]. i feel sad because if i had kept the shares, the dividends would have been enough to service the interest and pay part of the loan. but [the share sale] was not an indication of confidence  more to pay back the bank, thats all.

(see sias 2q earnings fall 70% to $65 mil on weak operating numbers) most companies in the group recorded weaker operating results amid a sluggish global economy, with only scoot and tigerair bucking the trend. scoot and tigerair overturned losses from a year ago to register operating profits of s$5 million and s$3 million, respectively. singapore airlines on friday revealed that tigerair will be integrated into the scoot brand under a single operating licence. (see tigerair to be integrated under scoot brand) from the cost aspect, we believe there will be savings, though to a limited extent, through integration of support functions and touchpoint integration for customers, says ocbc investment research lead analyst eugene chua in a monday report. the real value of this integration is on its revenue growth potential, chua adds. with a single licence, we expect the new scoot to be more nimble in terms of flight scheduling to optimise flight connections between the two currently separate airlines. ocbc is maintaining its hold recommendation on sia, but lowered its fair value estimate to s$10.22, from s$10.80 previously. cimb analyst raymond yap says sia has been stuck in first gear for the past year, but the belated move will have positive repercussions for sia. with this move, the sia group is belatedly closing the yawning chasm that separates it from the highly-successful airasia group, says yap in a report on friday. the merger of brands and operations will be necessary to generate the revenue synergies that will finally justify the cost that sia paid for the privatisation (of tiger airways). cimb is keeping sia at hold with an unchanged target price of s$10.47. uob kay hian lead analyst k. ajith agrees that the integration could lead to cost savings and incremental revenue. in addition, ajith says it could be a prelude to a public offering. we believe that sia could potentially list its low-cost arm to improve its liquidity position, ajith says in a monday report. the biggest challenge sia faces is one of liquidity. according to ajith, sia has some s$17 billion of capex over the next four years, and estimates that its operating cash flow will only fund less than half of capex. uob is keeping its hold

from 10.2% to 14.4%. in a thursday report, cimb analyst jessalynn chen says the latest developments will bring new firepower for [singposts] investment in e-commerce logistics and thus boost logistics earnings growth in the medium term. assuming the entire s$86.2 million proceeds from the jv will be put into investments, spost would have s$223.9m at its disposal to invest in its e-commerce

forecasts, noting an anaemic rental uplift despite higher tenant sales and shopper traffic. as such, the pair expect the trusts earnings growth for 4q16 and fy17 to be relatively muted to reflect the recent closure of funan mall for redevelopment over the next three years. the planned s$54 million rejuvenation/enhancement exercise at raffles city shopping centre over 3q16-1q18, including the upgradation of lift lobbies as well as the revamp of central atrium at level 3, is unlikely to move the earnings needle significantly when completed, although it would improve shopper experience at the property, in our view, they add. on the contrary, analysts derek tan and mervyn song believe the negative dpu for this quarter is a false alarm, as retention is boxed for distribution in 4q, although tan and song expect flattish dpu growth for the full year, they highlight that cmt retained s$12 million of its taxable income in 1q16, which is equivalent to about 34 cents in dpu terms u2013 and which the analysts are convinced will be paid out in the festive season in the next quarter. however, they caution that any surprise move by the fed may cause ripples in the market although consensus is still ruling out a hike in november. in the unlikely scenario of a rate hike ahead of consensus year-end expectation, we believe this will be an opportunity for investors to accumulate the stock on any dips, conclude tan and song.  additionally, both the research houses of cimb and dbs think cmt has sufficient headroom for the redevelopment of funan mall, although gearing is expected to rise. as cmt will fund funans redevelopment cost of s$560 million entirely with debt, which is comfortably below the s$800 million headroom available, gearing is expected to increase to 38%, which is still healthy, explain dbs lock and yeo. as at 12:12pm, units of cmt are trading 1.422% higher at s$2.14."}, "236": {"date_posted": "21/10/2016", "title": "klci stays flat as pm

in the coming years. in this low-yield, low-return environment, they would need to reconsider not only the vehicles in which they keep their money but also the cost of doing so. hedge funds that charge management fees of 1% to 5% and performance fees of 10% to 20%, as well as unit trust funds that have upfront sales charges of 3% to 5% and annual management fees of 1.5% to 2%, are coming under close scrutiny as many of them have underperformed the market in the past few years. the current consensus on the future direction of the capital markets makes the cost of investing an even more pertinent issue. hence, investors are increasingly on the lookout for low-cost investment vehicles that do not erode their returns, especially those planning for retirement. phil stockton, director and co-owner of private capital ltd in hong kong, says investors should be allocating more of their portfolios to exchange-traded funds (etfs) in this environment. logically, when we are facing modest capital market assumptions, it follows that active managers will be hard-pressed to deliver value for their fees. the hedge fund industry in particular looks very expensive in this context. on the other hand, if one buys into the low-cost msci world equity etf, the worst that could happen to an investor is getting the total market return minus the total expense ratio (ter) and any platform costs, such as brokerage fees, says stockton. as an investor myself, i would take this [low-cost approach] rather than risk my retirement funds with an active fund manager who thinks he can beat the market. empirical evidence tells us this is not the case. private capital is a fee-based, commission-free investment management and financial planning firm. it is registered with the securities and futures commission of hong kong. aw choon hui, deputy ceo of gyc financial advisory pte ltd in singapore, says etfs are a great fit for ones long-term investment plan as they represent a huge chunk of the investible market. as frequent trading does not benefit investors in the long run, we only consider etfs for short-term trading opportunities if they are of the more esoteric nature, such as volatility or leveraged shorts on certain asset classes. aw believes that the shift to low-cost investing is gathering speed as investors are becoming more well-informed and educated. they are also starting to realise that they can enhance their investments via low-cost instruments because a lot of the high-cost investment products did not work well for them. gyc financial advisory is an independent financial advisory firm unaffiliated with any financial institution. it is registered with the monetary authority of singapore. robert foo, managing director of myfp services sdn bhd, says the low cost of etfs makes them a great retirement planning tool. he adds that the firm has been allocating a portion of its clients portfolios to etfs for quite some time now. compared with unit trust funds, etfs are a much cheaper alternative. for offshore etfs, such as those of vanguard or ishares, the transaction fee is as low as 0.07% as they have to be competitive, says foo, adding that investors also pay a brokerage fee of 0.1% to 0.7%, depending on who the broker is. foo says the firm has seen a heavy shift to etfs over the years and that they now make up more than 90% of its clients portfolios. myfp services is an independent fee-based financial planning firm licensed by the securities commission malaysia. mahdzir othman, ceo of i-vcap management sdn bhd, says etfs can generate stable returns over the long run with minimal hassle and at a cost-efficient rate if investors are savvy enough in terms of market timing and the type of etfs they choose. as an etfs objective is to closely track the performance of its benchmark, investors have full control of their investment and enjoy lower risk, depending on the type of underlying securities or assets, due to its transparency. around the world, etfs are becoming popular among investors. pwc says in its latest report, etfs: a roadmap to growth, that it expects accelerated growth in these funds in the next five years, with global assets under management (aum) expected to exceed us$7 trillion by 2021. of this figure, asian firms are expected to see an annual growth rate of 18%. according to the report, which was released in july, the growth drivers of etfs in the asian market are the use of etfs in retirement planning, improving investor education and growing distribution channels. in addition to their low cost, top-performing global etfs have delivered stellar returns as their underlying indices recover from the losses of recent years. according to morningstar, the leading etfs in the large growth, large value, mid-cap growth, mid-cap value, small growth and small value categories saw returns of 120.52%, 42.22%, 106.94%, 52.89%, 150.58% and 48.05% respectively for the 12 months ended oct 5. by comparison, the top-performing us mutual funds in the same categories provided returns of 20.74%, 25.69%, 19.62%, 27.37%, 30.03% and 33.91% respectively. there are eight etfs in malaysia, two of which are issued by cimb-principal asset management, two by aminvestment services and the rest by i-vcap management. they have different exposures in terms of geography and sectors. some track local indices while others track regional ones. according to the edge-lipper fund table, local etfs have seen mixed performance over the years, but many of them continue to give higher returns than a significant portion of the unit trust funds in the same category (see table). the fees for investing in these etfs are significantly lower than those for unit trust funds. for example, i-vcap managements myetf thomson reuters asia pacific ex-japan islamic agribusiness carries a management fee of 0.75%, trustee fee of 0.045% and index licence fee of 0.05%. the ter of our etfs ranges from 0.5% to 0.7%, making them much more tolerable than unit trust funds. the ter of unit trusts would be about 1.6%, excluding the upfront sales charge. investors should take this into consideration before making an investment decision, says mahdzir. however, there are some challenges when it comes to investing in local etfs, says foo, as there are only eight in the market and they charge a higher transaction fee than their offshore counterparts, some of which charge as low as 0.07%.  how to choose etfs gycs aw suggests a broad allocation of etfs for investors to consider as building blocks for their long-term investment plan. we like the vanguard total stock market (vti: us) as it tries to capture the entire us equity market at a very low cost (0.05%). the vanguard total bond market index fund (bnd: us) is good at capturing the broad investment-grade fixed-income market in the us, which includes treasuries, mortgage-backed securities and credit. the ishares msci acwi etf (acwi: us) is good for a global equity allocation as it includes emerging markets and asia-pacific in a single fund, he says. vti: us and bnd: us are listed on nyse arca while acwi: us is listed on nasdaq gm. private capitals stockton has etf holdings in vanguard and ishares. he says if a target-date etf or index fund is not available, one can use ultra-low-cost etfs to get the appropriate risk-adjusted exposure via the msci world, s&p 500 or emerging market equities indices. investors can get bond exposure via the total bond and emerging market bond indices. some of the etfs stockton mentions, such as the ishares msci emerging asia index etf and vanguard s&p 500 index etf, are listed on the hong kong stock exchange while others are mainly listed in the us. he thinks there are enough etfs to choose from in the market. however, in certain regional markets, there is a bias towards home or regional exposure. some providers, such as vanguard and ishares, have a very small presence in markets such as hong kong. institutional investors can use etfs listed overseas, but retail clients are often restricted to those listed on their domestic exchanges. this situation has seen some improvement but it is still a cause for frustration, says stockton. what we also need is better distribution of etfs. in markets such as the uk, the us, australia and new zealand, there are multiple wrap platforms for investors to use. this is essential for price competition and innovation. one can have access to the lowest cost etf available but if the implementation cost is high, the low-cost benefit is eroded. myfp services foo says there are thousands of etfs tracking a wide range of asset classes for investors to choose from. however, investors should not compare the performance of local etfs to their offshore peers as the funds have different exposure or may be tracking different indices. he thinks this is where investor education is needed. what should investors look for when choosing etfs? mahdzir says past performance aside, investors should pay attention to the tracking error of an etf as it is an indication of whether the fund is tracking the index closely. a good etf should track the underlying index as close as possible. our etfs have a tracking error of less than or about 1%. the general rule is that a tracking error of less than 3% is acceptable for tracker funds like etfs. tracking error is the difference between the returns of the tracker fund and the underlying index. it is essential for an etf to have a minimal tracking error as it means the returns of the etf would not be too far off from the performance of the index it tracks. gycs aw says the company prefers a mix of etfs, select actively managed funds, low-cost mutual funds and risk-managed funds when building out a portfolio. this approach helps to extend the efficient frontier in portfolio construction and gets the best risk/return ratio. it really boils down to the amount of losses an investor can take and the best risk-adjusted return the manager can give to clients after constructing the portfolio with the various etfs and funds. we prefer to allocate differently from the rest of the market and not commingle all the different assets into one portfolio, he adds.  gaining traction in asia-pacific etfs have seen significant growth in the last 10 years. according to london-based independent research and consultancy firm etfgi, assets invested in etfs and exchange-traded products listed around the world reached a record us$3.34 trillion at end-july. jackie choy, morningstar asias director of etf research, says etfs have started to gain traction in asia-pacific too. for asia-pacific, the aum for etfs grew 20% to us$296 billion for the 12 months ended june. there are different dynamics for different countries. in the past 12 months, significant growth has come out of japan. its aum grew 23% to us$146 billion, he adds. the key driver of the growth in japan, he says, was government initiatives. the bank of japan uses etfs as part of its quantitative and qualitative monetary easing programme. the central bank announced in july that it would double its rate of etf purchases to an annual pace of us$59 billion as part of its efforts to expand monetary stimulus. is the growth in the aum of etfs a result of the decline in the aum growth of mutual funds? choy says this is the case in the us, but it may not be true in other countries. in the us, we have been seeing net outflows from actively managed funds and net inflows into passively managed ones. for the other regions, we havent seen that trend. he believes robo-advisory firms will help etfs see more growth in asia as they are a natural tool for a robo-advisory portfolio. however, this segment is still new in asia and international players have yet to enter the region. when it comes to etfs, choy says different countries are at different stages of development. the etf market is less mature in asia, he notes, making product development an important issue in the region.  etfs and unit trusts on the same playing field us-based independent investment research and management firm morningstar announced in early september that it was putting exchange-traded funds (etfs) and open-end mutual funds into the same peer group in fund ratings. it will also provide forward-looking morningstar analyst rating methodology for etfs, just like it does for mutual funds. research firms such as thomson reuters lipper have been comparing these two types of funds for quite some time now. why is morningstar making the move? jackie choy, morningstar asias director of etf research, says the firm has noticed that investors increasingly see open-end funds and etfs as interchangeable options when choosing investments. we have been providing qualitative research and analyst reports on etfs for more than eight years. applying our globally consistent morningstar analyst rating methodology to these mainly passive investments is a natural extension of our research process. what does this mean for etf players, unit trust fund managers and investors? choy says assigning the qualitative rating model to etfs will help investors assess their prospects based on the fundamental research its analysts conduct. the enhancements will better support advisers and other financial intermediaries. being in the same playing field, mutual fund companies should be more aware that open-end funds and etfs are interchangeable options when choosing investments. for investors, they will be able to use the same lens from morningstar when assessing mutual funds and etfs, he adds. choy says the morningstar active/passive barometer  midyear 2016 report shows how actively managed funds in the us performed compared with their passively managed counterparts. it finds that actively managed funds have generally underperformed their passive counterparts, especially over longer time horizons, and experienced higher mortality rates. the report finds that failure tended to be positively correlated with fees. the higher-cost funds were more likely to underperform, be shuttered or merged away while lower-cost funds were likelier to survive and enjoy greater odds of success, he adds.  i-vcap to promote local etfs exchange-traded funds (etfs) could be a great investment planning tool for investors. the first malaysian etf  the abf malaysia bond index fund, issued by aminvest management bhd  was set up in 2005. the first malaysian shariah-compliant etf  the myetf dow jones islamic malaysia titans 25, issued by i-vcap management sdn bhd  was set up in 2008. why are so many investors still unaware of this option? mahdzir othman, ceo of i-vcap management, acknowledges that few activities have been carried out over the years to promote etfs. however, as more investors realise that unit trusts are not their only option and begin to show interest in etfs, things are expected to change. we set out to ramp up efforts to reach out and inform investors through participation in roadshows and other on-the-ground marketing activities for retail investors as well as private sessions with institutional investors. as the largest shariah etf issuer in the world, our shariah-compliant myetf series is an attractive option for those who are interested in socially responsible investments that can provide stable returns in the long run, he says. i-vcap is working with the relevant parties to see increased trading liquidity for etfs on the stock exchange while engaging institutional investors to participate via creation and redemption activities that are more seamless and efficient. the company currently manages four shariah-compliant etfs. the myetf dow jones islamic malaysia titans 25, myetf msci malaysia islamic dividend and myetf msci southeast asia islamic dividend provided returns of 4.34%, 9.95% and -5.32% respectively for the year ended sept 23. the myetf thomson reuters asia pacific ex-japan islamic agribusiness, which was launched in november last year, saw a return of 5.72% for the six months ended sept 23. so far, etfs have been gaining traction in malaysia. last year, the malaysian etf market saw its total volume traded on bursa malaysia grow 71% to rm29.8 million from rm17.4 million in 2014, says mahdzir. as at end-july, the industrys total aum had grown to rm2.2 billion. mahdzir hopes that as the local financial advisory industry moves away from commissions to being fee-based, more financial advisers and planners will promote etfs to their clients. we have seen similar cases in the us, europe, australia and india. etfs gained higher traction when they turned into fee-based advisories, he says. typically, when investors buy into actively managed funds such as unit trusts, investors are relying on the fund managers skills to beat the market. however, despite beating the market, the high sales charge/commission and management fee often eat into the net investment return of investors. the advisory fee structure, therefore, provides a fairer arrangement for investors, for which financial advisers will provide better value-added services and pick the right products for the benefit of investors. on the other hand, he adds, etfs have an equal chance of giving decent returns without the high cost. financial advisers may start to advise clients on buying into various etfs and unit trusts for a better chance of generating higher returns."}, "239": {"date_posted": "18/10/2016", "title":

penang fire and rescue department spokesman said that the fire was put out by 10am. nobody was injured in the incident. in a note to clients yesterday, cimb research said it spoke to owgs management to obtain clarity on the matter and was told that the fire damage was immaterial. according to management, welding works on steel structures in the outdoor rear area of level five ignited some aluminium foil that started a small fire. this resulted in heavy smoke, it said. management clarified that the incident does not affect its official opening date of dec 18. it maintains its planned

the concept is komtar tower [in george town, penang] becoming an integrated tourism centre and retail play for the locals, possibly driving earnings from there, the fund manager tells the edge, adding that it boils down to how much an investor believes the concept will translate into earnings. owg was tasked with revitalising komtar tower in december 2012, which chan believes could be a catalyst for the stocks re-rating. the project involves the transformation of five levels in the tower into a high-end commercial space for retail and f&b outlets and a tourist observation deck that offers panoramic views of the city day and night. owg was granted a 45-year lease at an attractive rental rate with the option to extend for another 15 years. with improved clarity on komtars opening timeline, we believe the stock is poised for a significant re-rating. owg is trading at a forward fy2017 price-earnings ratio (per) of only 13.2 times, which is at a more than 40% discount to the f&b sectors average. this is unjustified, in our view, as the delay in komtars opening is merely a timing issue, chan says in a sept 4 note to clients. although there has been no official announcement on when the project will open its doors to the public, it is understood that this could happen in a couple of months. the plan is to open by the fourth quarter of the year u2026 we are looking at november or december. we have pre-sold tickets for it already, says a staff member of the top komtar penang, who declined to be named. under the plan, the top will be home to retail and f&b outlets and a plethora of activities. when asked how much the tickets would cost, the staff member says it is likely to be more than rm50 each. in his note, chan says owg sold tickets for komtars themed attractions and interactive lifts at the recent matta fair. tickets for the themed attractions were packaged and sold separately from tickets for the interactive lifts. the promotional rates for the lifts are rm80 for adults and rm52 for children. outside these promotional rates, the komtar tickets will have a two-tier pricing  foreigners and locals (c.20% cheaper). given the advance ticket sales, we believe komtar will finally open in late-november. in our new eps forecast, we now assume komtars interactive lifts to contribute to revenue from december (seven months to end-fy6/17) at a blended ticket rate of rm50 versus rm30 previously. this is still conservative as the promotional rates are rm80 for adults but exclude the travel agents commission. when contacted, chan tells the edge that the komtar projects potential lies in tourist visits. i am assuming one million visitors a year, which i think is realistic as penang hill sees 1.4 million visitors a year. the ministry of tourism and culture is targeting 30.5 million tourist arrivals this year, which could translate into tourism receipts of rm103 billion. there is no official estimated breakdown of tourist arrivals for specific states but news reports note that figures released by penang global tourism show that the island state recorded passenger traffic of 6.03 million in 2014. in his note, chan states that he has not imputed any revenue or profit contributions from komtars themed attractions. we have also not imputed additional profit contribution from the additional space that owg will be securing since it is still finalising the amount of additional space in sky plaza at genting highlands. we estimate that owgs total space in genting could be up to 50% more than its current space. owgs main businesses are food services and amusement and recreational services. its f&b business includes qiqi taiwan cuisine, qiqi taiwan snacks and only mee. the bulk of its food outlets are located in genting highlands and its operations there contribute more than half to the groups revenue. in its komtar tower project, owg opened its first fine dining restaurant on level 59 in june last year. its amusement and recreational games business includes indoor playground for children jungle gym, escape room and starship galactica.  rising borrowings while owgs earnings have yet to pick up, the group saw a noticeable uptick in its borrowings in its financial year ended june 30, 2016 (fy2016). as at june 30, its long-term borrowings had doubled to rm51 million from rm24.9 million a year earlier while its short-term borrowings had risen to rm4.8 million from rm2.1 million in the same period. on this, chan tells the edge the rise in borrowings was due to the additional capital expenditure that owg incurred for its komtar tower project. they have about 300,000 sq ft now compared with 130,000 sq ft before. the capital expenditure was estimated at rm60 million but that has risen to rm180 million. in fy2016, owgs revenue rose 12.7% year on year to rm97.7 million but its net profit dropped 10.6% to rm12.3 million due to higher cost of sales and administrative expenses. in fy2015, revenue rose 5% y-o-y to rm86.9 million while net profit dropped 3% to rm14.1 million. owg is still one of our top small-cap picks for 2016/17. we raise our target price by 11% (to rm4.36) after our fy2018f eps upgrade, still pegged to 21.2 times cy2017f per, a 10% small-cap and liquidity discount to the f&b sector average. potential re-rating catalysts include the launch of komtars lifts in october or november and higher-than-expected visitation numbers. a key risk is further delay in komtars opening, says chan in his note, adding that he has cut its fy2017 eps by 6% to 16 sen. cimb research has an add recommendation on owg and a target price of rm4.36. the stocks 52-week closing high was rm2.68 on jan 15, 2016, while its 52-week closing low was 71.8 sen on jan 23, 2015. owg was listed ondec 14,

was to be reduced to 10% from 30% till october 2016. the duty on crude palm oil (cpo) was to be reduced to 7.5% from 12.5% and on refined palm oil to 15% from 20%. the government cut import duties to boost domestic supplies via higher imports and keep prices of agricultural commodities in the country in check during the upcoming festive season in october. according to trade sources, if the cbec had not lowered the import duties, there could be an acute shortage of wheat flour during the coming festive season as flour mills were left with little stock. the government reduced the import duty on potatoes to improve domestic availability. in the case of palm oil, officials said the retail price of palm oil showed a rising trend in the past few months because of a surge in global markets. the landed price of crude palm oil in mumbai between aug 2 and sept 2 had risen from 45% to 52% while that of refined palm oil had gone up from 37% to 40%. we are positively surprised by the decision to cut both the import duty of crude and refined palm oil by 5 percentage points. this is because the indian edible oil industry body solvent extractors association has been urging the government to cut the import duty of cpo from 12.5% to 5% but to keep the import duty on refined palm oil at 20%, to widen the duty differential to 15%. this is because, at the current duty differential of 7.5% between the two palm products, it is not competitive to refine palm oil in india and cheaper to import refined palm products. as a result, india has imported more refined palm oil and around half of indias refining capacity of around 25 million tonnes have been idle for a few years. we view this news as a slight positive for cpo prices as it will make palm oil more competitive in india against other edible oils. this is because the government has only reduced the import duties on palm oil but kept the import duties for other edible oils at 12.5% for crude and 20% for refined edible oils. this will improve palm oil competitiveness against other edible oils by 5% or us$37.4 (rm154.46) a tonne (at the latest refined, bleached and deodorized palm oil price of us$748 per tonne) in india. we are positive on this news as it could boost indian demand for palm oil due to the more attractive import duties and be supportive of cpo prices. we are sticking to our average cpo price assumptions

and refined palm oil was reduced by five percentage points to 7.5% and 15%. kenanga research plantation analyst voon yee ping said the sentiment is positive with the import tax cut, but the uptrend in cpo price may not be sustainable as the production is expected to recover. the production of palm oil is expected to recover and peak in october and november, she said when contacted. voon said the focus will be on palm oils rival, soy bean oil, as the premium between soy bean oil and cpo is getting narrower, adding that the cpo price support could be temporary. with the soy bean harvest coming in, the price of soy bean oil is not sustainable too, she said, maintaining her cpo price forecast for the year at rm2,400 per tonne. cimb research regional head of plantations ivy ng said indias import tax cut is a positive surprise and it provides support to the benchmark cpo price. prices may soften post-deepavali in october, but we think it will remain supported by the current stock level in malaysia, which is quite low, she said. in august, malaysias palm oil inventories fell 17.29% to a multi-year low of 1.464 million tonnes from 1.771 million tonnes in the preceding month as exports rose at a faster pace compared with the cpo output. in her note yesterday, she said the import tax cut will make palm oil more competitive in india against other edible oils. this is because the

malaysian palm oil, with a 19% share of the total palm oil exported from malaysia in the eight months period of 2016, she noted. she maintained her neutral call on the sector and cpo price forecast of rm2,400 per tonne for this year and rm2,600 per tonne for next year. her top picks are genting plantations bhd, first resources ltd and astra agro lestari. according to a leading industry analyst dorab mistry, cpo prices are expected to decline around 19% from current levels to rm2,200 ringgit per tonne over the next two months as production recovers in the new oil year. reuters said that in the current oil year ending september, palm prices have gained 9% as dryness linked to an el nino weather event curbed yields across indonesia and malaysia. while global palm oil output for 2015/16 is seen declining by significantly more than the previous forecast of 2.5 million tonnes, a strong recovery next year should offset the deficit. mistry was quoted as saying at industry conference globoil india that overall in oil year 2015/16, palm oil production will decline by over six million tonnes, a decline which has never before been seen in history. but production next oil and calendar years could see a strong recovery of almost 6.5 million tonnes, he said, adding that the rapid expansion of palm oil production in central and south america should not be ignored. he had forecast cpo prices to drop to rm2,200 per tonne over the next two months. meanwhile, midf research analyst alan lim pointed out that the reduction in import tax will boost the demand for cpo from india. but contrary to mistrys view, he said the recovery in production may not be as strong. he expects the cpo price to stay strong in the next three months despite production recovery. the recovery will be limited due to the lagged impact from strong el nino, lim said when contacted, adding that he expects the benchmark cpo price to hover between 2,500 and 3,000 per tonne in the next three months. yesterday, the cpo

"derivatives: growth of futures market set to continue (part 1)", "article": "  the futures market in malaysia has grown considerably in the past five years and it is something not many people are aware of. this growth is expected to continue, spurred by technology and new product offerings, says azila abdul aziz, ceo and head of listed derivatives at kenanga deutsche futures sdn bhd. the trading volumes of crude palm oil futures (fcpo) and fbm klci futures (fkli) on bursa malaysia derivatives have grown at a compound annual growth rate of about 15% over the past five years, according to azila. last year alone, there were 14 million contracts traded, which translates into rm858 billion in trade value. this compares with six million contracts traded in 2010, valued at rm114 billion, she says. the fcpo and fkli are the most traded futures products in the country. azila, who is president of malaysian futures brokers association, says open interest in the futures market shows that it is not a speculative market that can cause high volatility. of the 14 million futures contracts traded last year, 2.3 million were open interest. the ratio is six to one, showing that it is a healthy market. this is unlike some overseas exchanges, where the number of open interest is very small but the trading volume is huge, she adds. open interest means the total number of open or outstanding futures contracts on the market. market participants who establish a trading position (long or short position) and keep the position open over a given period of time are considered to have open interest. market participants with open interest are usually those who want to hedge their investments when the markets are volatile or companies that intend to lock in the future buying or selling prices of raw materials. in contrast, speculators make intraday trades to bet on the short-term price movements of futures contracts. they buy and sell contracts within a short period without establishing a trading position overnight or keeping an open interest. thus, the higher the number of open interest, vis-u00e0-vis the trading volume, the less speculative the market. azila is optimistic that the futures market will grow at the current pace over the next five years to reach a trading volume of about 22 million contracts per year. while this is a far cry from the top futures exchanges globally, there is still room for improvement at bursa malaysia derivatives (bmd), she says. azila believes the volume will rise when market players, including fund houses and retail investors, are more aware of what the market can offer. more foreign players are expected to come on board as the trading volume increases, she says. malaysia is ranked 39th among the top 50 futures exchanges globally in terms of trading volume, based on a survey by the futures industry association that was published last year. the association is one of the leading global trade organisations for futures, options and centrally cleared derivatives markets. the top five futures exchanges are the cme group, intercontinental exchange, eurex (headquartered in germany, dealing primarily with european-based derivatives), national stock exchange of india and bm&f bovespa (su00e3o paulo, brazil). in aggregate, the top five exchanges account for 10 billion contracts traded per year. the average trading volume of the 50 exchanges is 500 million contracts. we are now only at 14 million, but we are getting there, says azila.  growth drivers technology and new product offerings will be the next growth catalyst for malaysias futures market. azila notes that with fintech firms adopting blockchain technology, investors and traders could easily open brokerage accounts with several brokerage firms using a single chip. this compares with the traditional way of filling up futures account opening forms, one after another. these documents are then manually submitted to related parties such as banks (where funds are deposited to settle the variation of margins) and be processed over time. lets say you are a retail customer and you want to open an account with kenanga deutsche futures and cimb futures to trade on both platforms and use two solutions. what you do now is come to kenanga, provide us all the necessary details and fill up all the documents to open an account with us. then, you go to cimb and do that all over again, says azila. but with the blockchain technology, all the relevant information involved in kyc (know your customer) procedures can now be obtained by all other brokerage firms via a private distributed ledger that is accessible to them. the banks will also refer to the private distributed ledger to verify your information. this is envisioned to boost efficiency in the market and reduce cost and time. blockchain technology has sparked many discussions in global futures markets and it is believed that it will happen in malaysia sooner or later, says azila. on a higher level, we envisage a major shift in the payment and settlement process, brought about by technological advancements. azila, who has been in the futures industry for many years, is a big believer of technology changing the marketplace. she has witnessed how the local futures market has evolved in recent years because of new technology. the futures trading system transformed from an open outcry system in the 1990s into an electronic trading platform in 2003. then, market direct access was kick-started, where not only brokers and traders could execute futures trade orders using the automated platform but retail investors were also allowed to open a brokerage account and trade futures contracts on their own. the average trade volume under the open outcry system was 700 to 1,000 contracts per day. the volume rose 10 times to 7,000 contracts when the trading system was automated. and when the direct market access began, the trading volume went up to 14,000 contracts and open interest reached more than 100,000. technology always brings change. it is unavoidable as more millennials enter the market. they are savvier and tend to get things done virtually, says azila. regulators, which play a crucial role in protecting the rights and benefits of the public and helping the futures market grow, should understand this and find a balance between regulation and innovation, she says. everything is moving so fast today. fintech advancement must be balanced with the need to comply with regulatory requirements. and the regulators have to find a solution for technology changes and strike a balance between the two."}, "249": {"date_posted": "8/9/2016", "title": "great potential in cimb groups vietnam subsidiary", "article": "

support level remained at 1,665 points. momentum indicators like the relative strength index and oscillator have fallen below their mid-levels. this indicates that the market sentiment has turned bearish. the moving average convergence divergence indicator, which has already indicated a bearish momentum two weeks ago, continued to decline. in addition, the fbm klci is now nearing the bottom band of the bollinger bands indicator. these indicate a bearish market trend and sentiment. the fbm klci support level remains at 1,665 points, as i have highlighted in the past few weeks. the fbm klci has gone as low as 1,668.7 points this week. therefore, there is still a possibility for the fbm klci to rebound as it is yet to break below the support level. the rebound may find resistance at 1,690 points. if the index fails to break above 1,690 points, then the downtrend may resume and the next support level can only be found at 1,650.0 points. benny lee is chief market strategist for

gainers seen in early pre-election rally", "article": "  kuala lumpur: some political analysts have the gut feeling that the next general election (ge) will happen as early as the first half of 2017, the end of which is less than 10 months away. there are also market players betting on this, given the positive news flows on a few politically linked stocks of late. however, there are many other stocks which have perceived ties to the ruling barisan nasional (bn) coalition that have barely gone up, notwithstanding the fact that foreign investors have been returning to emerging markets as yields in advanced countries fall into sub-zero range. fund managers and analysts contacted by the edge financial daily said the election play had begun on bursa malaysia, though they noted only five glcs or government-linked companies are seen benefiting from the emergence of the theme so far, namely: felda global ventures holdings bhd (fgv), umw holdings bhd, umw oil & gas corp bhd (umw-og), drb-hicom bhd and pos malaysia bhd. but in a second half of 2016 strategy note released last month, cimb investment bank bhd listed as many as 17 glcs benefiting from the election play (see table). inter-pacific securities sdn bhd head of research pong teng siew acknowledged that investors could make short-term profit from the election play. aside from being an apologist for fundamentals, he told the edge financial daily there is one problem that could work against those chasing the pre-election rally. its a good way to make a bit of profit every four years. but these rallies tend to run ahead of their fundamentals and its difficult to pinpoint when the right time to buy is. if you buy these stocks too early, you may sit on them for a long time, he said over the telephone last thursday. utusan melayu (m) bhd, for example, is one glc with unenviable financials. its share price gradually deteriorated from a closing high of 70.5 sen to as low as 58 sen in the span of six months before the 13th ge. however, it shot up by 8.55% to 63.5 sen on may 3, the final trading day before polling day. even in the run-up to the 2004 ge, which was said to be a feel-good election when tun abdullah ahmad badawi led bn to one of the biggest wins for the coalition, utusan shares ended the six-month window before the election 4.69% lower at rm1.613. the highest closing price it achieved within the period was rm2.08, on oct 29, 2003.  positive news flows umno directly owns the newspaper publisher with a 49.77% stake, thus it has had the long-standing perception that the political party will get all the help it wants to boost advertisement sales before the election. utusans status as a penny stock, too, could make it a prime target for speculators and market punters. but poor fundamentals, as seen by utusans falling full-year profit before the 13th ge, made any rally in its counter short-lived. the same was true for malaysian resources corp bhd (mrcb) before tan sri salim mohamed took over the companys management, as net profit for the group in the financial year ended dec 31, 2012 fell by 35.71%. fast forward to the present, mrcb has soared by 11.97% so far this month to close at rm1.31 last friday. kub malaysia bhd, on the other hand, has only risen noticeably since end-may, though the company has turned around for the past two quarters. etiqa insurance and takaful bhd head of research chris eng was one of the analysts contacted who noticed fgv, umw holdings, umw-og, drb-hicom and pos malaysia as those being on an uptrend. he said while the upcoming election helps bring a positive sentiment, most of these companies have their own drivers and stories to propel their share prices upwards. fgv has a turnaround story, and so does drb-hicom. umw holdings, meanwhile, had been trading at a depressed valuation for a long time. and with news about new toyota and perodua model launches, there are positive news coming in from these companies. the plantation groups new chief executive officer datuk zakaria arshad has also done his media rounds recently, telling the edge weekly that the worst days for its palm oil business were over, and that the group was looking to lower its cost. since zakaria succeeded datuk mohd emir mavani abdullah on april 1, fgv shares had risen by 36.23% to rm2.03 last friday. kumpulan wang persaraan (diperbadankan) has bought a net 9.89 million or 0.27% of fgv shares since. a fund manager, when contacted, also admitted to buying fgv shares recently. umw holdings and umw-og, curiously, only saw sharp appreciation in their share prices just three days last week. between last monday and wednesday, their counters jumped by 14.16% and 3.91% respectively, despite thin trading volumes relative to their share bases. regardless, eng said malaysias market sentiment, ultimately, had improved somewhat. at least, things are looking better than in developed markets. foreign funds are flowing into emerging markets after the brexit referendum, [though] malaysia has been a laggard among its peers. and its unlikely the us federal reserve will raise interest rates in september, so malaysia seems to be in a good place for at least the coming few months, he said. from junes low of 1,614.9 points, the fbm klci went up by 4.29% to settle at 1,684.15 points last friday. net foreign fund inflow to bursa up to last thursday was rm1.78 billion, which, if annualised, will still be less than the total net inflow of rm3.03 billion in 2013  the year bn won the ge in what was said to be the stiffest competition it had had. bear in mind too that there was a withdrawal of funds in the second half of the same year as the us began hinting at the end of its quantitative-easing programme. eng said historically, there would be a stock-market rally six months before a ge. cimb, meanwhile, said rm30 billion worth of construction jobs had been awarded up to july 14, while the estimated total value for the year is rm156.68 billion  a multi-year high. this is very positive and will create a feel-good factor, boosting consumption spending. this would be a good time for the government to hold elections, noted cimb regional and malaysia head of research michael greenall in a july note. former deputy prime minister tun musa hitam told reporters that bn might call for the ge very soon during

we had a time when there was a fragmented umno, when there were many umno leaders who had a key presence in the corporate sector. they were a source of patronage. they were powerful people who had interests in the corporate sector. but this is not the case today. now you see a well-integrated executive controlling the corporate sector, says gomez in a recent public lecture entitled who owns corporate malaysia now? ownership and control of glics. he argues that this new shift has put extreme concentration of economic and political control in the hands of the prime minister. the story of corporate malaysias evolution from a post-independence nation to the present day is not purely one of private enterprise and capitalist endeavours. there are other important, interconnected dynamics at play as well, including economic and social policies and politics. the professor recalls a time in the 1990s which saw the rise of a bumiputera capitalist class that was closely aligned with umno leaders. this was during the era of tun dr mahathir mohamad, tun daim zainuddin and datuk seri anwar ibrahim. in tracing the broad history of control over the malaysian economy, gomez says the 1970s saw a transition from extensive ownership by foreign interests post-independence to the ascendancy of government-owned enterprises in the 1980s. and when dr mahathir became prime minister in 1981, he took malaysia in a completely different direction by going for privatisation and liberalisation with a view of creating a pool of bumiputera corporate titans, says gomez. but the plan fell apart around 1997 at the time of the asian financial crisis. during tun abdullah ahmad badawis administration, the malay capitalist influence on the economy declined and there was a resurgence of glic dominance, gomez points out. so, is government over-intervention a necessary evil or of strategic importance to the malaysian economy? this has been hotly debated and opinions span the spectrum, from those who favour a free market economy where the government is not directly involved in business to those who favour state intervention in strategic sectors. private-sector entrepreneurs have long bemoaned the presence of the glcs, which some allege have an unfair advantage when it comes to accessing government contracts, financing and policies. at this point of their research, gomez and his team have yet to address the outcomes and impact of the glcs and glics on the malaysian economy. this trend of the governments overbearing influence runs contrary to prime minister datuk seri najib razaks earlier pledge that the government will divest the glcs so that the private sector can return to the driving seat of the economy. indeed, the government has commenced a plan to divest its interest in some glcs, either via paring down its stakes, public listing of companies or outright sales. but the slow pace of the divestments calls into question the governments sincerity in reducing its direct role in the economy. as at february 2013, less than half of the 33 glcs had been divested and 24 of them were supposed to have been divested between 2011 and 2012, according to the asian development bank (adb). an april 2013 paper by adb sought to answer the oft-asked question: are government-linked corporations crowding out private investment in malaysia? adb concluded that private investment in malaysia is indeed negatively affected by the dominance of glcs. we find that when glcs are dominant in an industry, investment by private firms is significantly negatively impacted. conversely, when glcs do not dominate an industry, the impact on private investment is not seen, according to the adb paper by jayant menon and thiam hee ng. private investment in malaysia  domestic or foreign  has never fully recovered from the impact of the asian financial crisis, adb notes. one explanation put forward in accounting for the sluggish performance of domestic private investment relates to the crowding-out effect as a result of the growing dominance of glcs in many sectors. the continued pervasiveness of glcs and their ability to exercise not only significant market power but also to use their special access to government and regulatory agencies to their favour suggests that they may present a formidable barrier to both competition and the entry of new private firms, adb adds."}, "261": {"date_posted": "8/8/2016", "title": "drb-hicom rises 11.7% on report of expecting 7 bidders for proton share sale", "article": " kuala lumpur (aug 8): drb-hicom bhd shares jumped as high as rm1.24 or 11.7% after the edge weekly reported that drb-hicom is expecting up to seven bids to purchase part or all of proton holdings bhd, which analysts hailed as a catalyst for the conglomerate controlled by tan sri syed mokhtar albukhary. at 12:02pm, drb-hicom was up by 11 sen or 9.91% to rm1.22 with 11 million shares traded. its intraday high was also the highest since jan 4. the edge weekly reported that most of the bids had already been received with one or two more due before the mid-august deadline. some interested suitors bandied about by sources were volkswagen ag and general motors co, and one chinese automaker  believed to be geely automobile holdings ltd. drb-hicom, which owns the loss-making proton, has had high target prices relative to its last traded price, which averaged at rm1.19. they ranged from a low of 76 sen to rm1.60. the highest target price was ascribed by cimb investment bank bhd. the research firm said it was positively surprised by drb-hicom's willingness to dispose of its entire stake in proton. \"we believe that, this time around, there is a higher chance that the sale of proton to a foreign partner may succeed given the recent reorganisation in proton's top level management and its need for further equity injection,\" said cimb analyst mohd shanaz noor azam in a note today. as at today, cimb is maintaining its earnings forecasts pending further developments. mohd shanaz said suzuki motor corp could be a frontrunner, given its signing of a memorandum of understanding with proton in june last year. \"drb-hicom's sale does not mean that proton will be controlled by foreigners. recall that the government has the option to take up a 79.28% stake in proton if it opts to convert its redeemable convertible cumulative preference shares (rccps) that were issued as part of a rm1.25 billion loan,\" he said. the edge weekly also said any decision will have to be presented to the special task force led by datuk seri idris jala, chief executive officer of the performance management and delivery unit (pemandu), which is monitoring proton's turnaround.

times versus industry, we are still not pricing at the industry p/bv, she said when contacted. ng said cimb had upgraded the stock based on the new strategy espoused by fgv chief executive officer (ceo) datuk zakaria arshad and its potential impact on earnings, which made fgvs valuation attractive. with the new ceo in place, and [with] his plans, we think that the stock should do much better, and as long as they achieve that potential, the valuation looks attractive enough to add this stock into [its] portfolio, she said. zakaria said in may that fgv is not looking at any mergers and acquisitions in the short term, and will instead hive off loss-making assets, cut down rm100 million in administration costs this financial year, trim production cost and boost yield. just a week after zakaria took over the position from previous ceo datuk mohd emir mavani abdullah on april 1, the group dropped its plan to buy a 55% stake in china-based zhong ling nutril-oil holdings ltd for rm976.25 million due to unfulfilled conditions. zakaria also strongly indicated that fgv will not proceed with the pt eagle high plantations deal with indonesias rajawali group. fgv slipped into the red for its first quarter ended march 31, 2016 (1qfy16) with a net loss of rm65.54 million, compared with a net profit of rm3.58 million a year ago, primarily due to lower crude palm oil production in

estimated book value of equity per share of rm1.77. when contacted, she said the impact from fgvs cost-cutting measures should be seen by year end. the risk to fgv is mainly to cpo (crude palm oil)

this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on august 4, 2016.  kuala lumpur: hartalega holdings bhds first quarter ended june 30, 2016 (1qfy17) results, announced on tuesday, fell short of expectations and triggered a selldown in its shares yesterday, leading to 16 sen or 3.77% being shaved off its stock to settle at rm4.08. net profit contracted 10.4% to rm56.2 million, which accounts for 19.5% of bloombergs consensus estimate for its fy17 results, even though revenue grew 25.4% to rm401.8 million. cimb equity research analyst walter aw said the underperformance was due to lower margins from a decline in average selling prices (asps), especially in the nitrile butadiene rubber (nbr) segment, an overall increase in operating costs, and a weaker us dollar against the ringgit. nevertheless, most research houses remained optimistic that hartalega will see gradual earnings recovery in the coming quarters. one of the main reasons for the underperformance was the below-average utilisation [capacity] rate of 82% during the quarter as a result of some ongoing production issues at some of its plants. we understand that most bottlenecks were resolved in june and the utilisation rate had risen to around 88% during june, and july, an analyst with a local fund house said. she added that a lag in transferring currency and raw material effects, as well as the 17% hike in gas tariff last december, further dragged margins during the quarter. looking ahead, with the gradual ramp-up of next generation integrated glove manufacturing complex, we should see earnings rise, she said. there is also the general view that there will be a slight recovery in nitrile gloves average selling price. aaron kee from affin hwang investment bank shared: our channel checks also indicate a slight recovery in nitrile gloves us dollar asp by up to 5% across the sector in the second quarter. another positive takeaway from hartalegas results announcement is its plan to slow down the commercialisation pace for the incoming capacity of its expansion plans. we are positive on this news as it will enable hartalega to concentrate on recovering its margins from recent volatility in currency, raw material prices and [the] hike in gas tariff. furthermore, we think slower capacity growth will help improve the demand-supply dynamics, midf equity research analyst noor athila mohd razali noted in her research report. while research houses, by and large, remained positive on hartalegas fy17 earnings, bloomberg consensus ratings showed 33% had a sell call on the stock, while 60% kept a hold rating; only one research house had a buy call after its first- quarter earnings were announced. maybank investment bank research analyst lee yen ling told the edge financial daily that while long-term investment is generally a good idea for glove counters, hartalegas valuation of 24 times its 2017 price-earnings ratio remains expensive, despite having fallen by 31.3% year-to-date. aw from cimb equity echoed lees sentiment in his research report: we believe hartalegas current valuations are unjustified, given its non-existent pricing premium and dwindling margins in [the] nbr segment, he added. however, m&a securities analyst choo hock chuan, who has a buy call on hartalega, deemed current latex prices and us dollar-ringgit exchange rates as favourable to hartalega, price competition notwithstanding. a possible interest rate hike in the us in the second half of 2016 that could lift the us dollar against the ringgit, and growing demand for gloves were the main reasons

(3qfy16) core net profit rose 30% year-on-year (y-o-y) due mainly to higher electricity consumption and higher tariff. electricity consumption in peninsular malaysia rose 6.2% y-o-y in 3qfy16 as the hot weather prompted consumers to switch on the air conditioners for longer hours. the hot weather also changed the consumption pattern, which lifted tnbs average tariff from 39.7 sen per kwh in 3qfy15 to 40.2 sen per kwh. a negative surprise was that tnb provided rm527 million for bad debts in the quarter. these provisions relate mainly to its customers in the steel industry. we expect tnbs future debt provisions related to this group of customers to be significantly smaller as tnb explained that it has taken a conservative approach in estimating the potential losses that could arise from defaults. tnb has written-off the entire receivables from some of its customers in this industry. we expect 4qfy16 earnings to be weaker due to seasonally higher expenses. on top of that, tnb reversed about rm456 million of negative accrued revenue (ar) that was recognised in the first half of financial year 2016. we understand that the ar amount in 4q16 should be small, if any. ar is an accounting item that adjusts for the difference between estimated and actual billing of electricity usage. also, we expect the consumption pattern of electricity to normalise as the weather has improved. this could lower tnbs average tariff in 4qfy16. during the conference call, we gathered that the management remains committed to improving the companys capital structure. the management is also reviewing the dividend policy, which we think is conservative. as tnbs balance sheet is undergeared (net gearing of only 33%), we believe raising dividend payout is a necessary step for tnb to optimise its capital structure. tnbs balance sheet and higher dividend payout will reduce the amount of earnings retained. in financial year ended aug 31, 2015 (fy15), tnbs effective dividend payout ratio was only 24%. although tnb intends to grow its business beyond malaysia, we believe it has the capability to raise its dividend payout ratio to more than 60% as its undergeared balance sheet will allow it to raise borrowings for expansion. at 60% payout, tnb will offer 6% dividend yield in fy16 to fy18 forecast. this will make it one of the highest-yielding stocks among the fbm klci

2012. now, instead of worrying about its earnings growth, investors seem more eager to know if the rally in f&ns share price  it hit a record high of rm26 last week  has legs. the stock has leapt 40% year to date, outperforming its peers nestlu00e9 (m) bhd and dutch lady milk industries bhd. fund managers and analysts we spoke to believe the share price, which has exceeded their target of rm25.34, has factored in f&ns earnings trajectory. though the gloomy outlook for private consumption has cast a pall on the consumer goods-related company, interestingly, it is the tough economic conditions that are in the stocks favour. kaf investment funds bhd chief investment officer gan kong yik opines that in the current challenging economic climate, essential consumer product companies like f&n would be much sought after for their defensive nature. the earnings of these companies will continue to grow and they pay decent dividends [even during tough times], he comments. cimb research analyst kristine wong expects f&n to continue to benefit from low milk prices, which she sees staying at their current levels over the next two years. according to global dairy trade, the prices of skim milk powder and whole milk powder started to drop in october last year. as at june 15, the prices had fallen to us$1,901 and us$2,118 per tonne from us$2,267 and us$2,824 per tonne respectively. global dairy trade is a marketplace to buy and sell a wide range of dairy products. the low milk prices and the integration of f&ns soft drink and dairy businesses, which has resulted in annual cost savings of rm10 million, have generated a windfall for the food and beverage (f&b) group. its net profit jumped 72.5% year on year to rm242.23 million in its first half ended march 31 (1hfy2016). this has prompted ceo lim yew hoe, who took the helm in december 2014, to map out several ways to utilise the bumper profit to generate future earnings. we have got a windfall from the low raw material prices. so, how do we make use of it? maybe, we can create another engine of growth for f&n by acquiring an asset, he remarks. while expecting more cost and revenue synergies following the business integration, the 49-year-old singaporean is scouting around for m&a opportunities in the downturn. when we look at m&a, we look at companies that the group can relate to in terms of markets or products, he says. acknowledging that there are good m&a opportunities in the global condensed milk market, lim says the company may set up a new plant to strengthen its position. he says though the global condensed milk market is currently worth us$8 billion, f&n has achieved only single-digit growth in this segment. despite the big jump in its earnings, f&ns growth in the malaysian market is limited, driven mainly by the strong sales of 100plus. lim does not want f&n to be involved in just isotonic drinks and dairy products but also both food and beverage. for malaysia, i am talking about non-beverage and dairy, such as food [snacks]. we are an f&b company but food is not in our stable yet. in a nutshell, lim intends to open a new chapter at f&n by expanding into uncharted territory, be it new products or markets. on whether any m&a will materialise this year, lim says it will depend on the opportunities that arise. however, he would not reveal any details. as at march 31, the group was in a net cash position of rm51.82 million, which means it will be able to raise debts to finance any m&a exercise. though some quarters were sceptical about the integration of the groups dairy and soft drink divisions, lim expects the synergy between the cost and revenue of the two businesses to be fully realised in the next two financial years. in fact, since the integration process began in october last year, f&n has leveraged the strengths of these businesses. thus, the companys distributors are selling all f&n products. lim expects a 15% growth in revenue and cost savings of rm10 million a year from the integration. he says the first changes were reflected in the first half of the year and sees further integration over the next 18 months. f&n achieved a record high revenue of rm4.06 billion in fy2015 while its net profit grew nearly 8% year on year to rm280.1 million. in 1hfy2016, revenue totalled rm2.05 billion while net profit jumped 72.5% y-o-y to rm242.23 million. though unwilling to offer any financial guidance, lim says based on the groups first six months of performance, the festive season is the key for it to outperform the market. based on our six-month sales, we are doing well. for the next six months, all depends on hari raya, which accounts for a big percentage of our annual performance. thus, these few weeks will be very important to us. lim says as the group is not a consumer staples company and needs cash to grow, it does not plan to adopt a dividend policy. however, management will endeavour to maintain its yearly dividend, he adds. the group declared an interim dividend of 27 sen for the first half of the year compared with 22 sen in the previous corresponding period. in fy2015, the group paid out a total net dividend of 57.5 sen. moving forward, the group will be launching more products. its own energy drink brand  ranger, which is in an incubation period  is expected to fill the vacuum left by red bull. but, according to lim, it may be another three to five years before ranger becomes a significant contributor to the groups earnings. the feedback on ranger has been positive thus far, although it accounts for only 10% of what red bull used to bring in, says lim. he is also unperturbed by the potential sin tax on soft drinks that may be imposed by the government, which will likely lead to a reduction in their consumption. he sees a minimal impact on earnings from this as the group has already lowered the sugar content of its beverages and offers healthier products today. it is like gst (goods and services tax). the impact will not be so great that consumers will stop drinking beverages. there will be a reduction in consumption but it wont be cut by half, lim comments. the groups best-selling product, 100plus, has the lowest sugar content compared with other carbonated drinks. meanwhile, its aseptic cold-filling polyethylene terephthalate bottle line in shah alam, which is expected to commence operations in the third quarter of the year, can produce more innovative drinks with less sugar. while the groups annual report shows that soft drinks accounted for rm1.51 billion or 37% of the groups total revenue of rm4.06 billion in fy2015, lim says this segment covers all beverages, including water and non-carbonated and energy drinks. according to him, the group is working closely with the government on the proposed tax. however, he hopes the authorities will weigh the implementation of the tax carefully as it is more viable to take a holistic approach to the diets, lifestyle and nutritional needs of consumers.

acquire a stake in pt eagle high plantations (ehp) is viewed as a positive development, due to concerns on the implications of this planned rm2.8 billion deal that was announced in june 2015. an official announcement that fgv is no longer buying a stake in ehp could act as one of four potential catalysts for the stock, said cimb research's plantations analyst ivy ng lee fang. the other three catalysts include plans to cut rm100 million administrative costs in financial year 2016, improvement of fresh fruit bunch (ffb) yields via better agronomic practices, and sale of assets that are

the rather unpredictable scenario in the first half of 2016 (1h16)  the ringgit strengthened after its slump in 2h15, oil prices still yet to recover since their downturn in june 2014 and brexit  analysts are retaining a cautious stance on the fbm klci. last friday, the fbm klci closed at 1.668.40. year to date, it has dropped 1.4% since closing at 1,692.51 on dec 31, 2015. in a recent strategy note, rhb research said the brexit vote had added another layer of uncertainty to equity markets that are already in a matured stage of growth. the local economy is also suffering from weak exports, soft consumer sentiment and slowing domestic demand, which is manifesting itself in a sharp slowdown in money supply growth. we retain our cautious stance on equity markets given that we are already in a matured stage of the global growth cycle, with rising risks  although we believe that there is a low risk of a global recession in the immediate term. policy easing is expected to continue, although policy ammunition is diminishing, wrote rhb. hlib research, in its strategy note, said the move by bank negara malaysia (bnm) to cut the overnight policy rate (opr) from 3.25% to 3% in view of the potential weakening of the external sector is positive for the market. the readiness of bnm to support economic growth via easing is overall positive for the market. coupled with [an] improved fiscal position, low foreign shareholding and possibility of a snap election, there is potential for the market to recharge to a higher level despite [a] still-lacklustre earnings outlook, said hlib. the edge financial daily spoke to the heads of leading research houses on their take on stocks that are worth watching in 2h16. some of them cautioned that it is difficult to stock-pick in the evolving global market. we may be bullish on certain stocks at this point of time but the trend may go against them later, said one head of research who requested not to be named. inter-pacific securities head of research pong teng siew offered a similar view, saying it is hard for him to generalise stocks at the moment given the markets volatility. pong said he does not see any specific sector being a clear beneficiary under the current market condition. you may say the current market is good for exports [but] those stocks under the sector may not be doing well, he told the edge financial daily. we have still managed to list 10 that analysts think deserve attention in 2h16. the stocks are cimb group holdings bhd, tenaga nasional bhd, bimb holdings bhd, kerjaya prospek group bhd, aeon credit services (m) bhd, lingkaran trans kota holdings bhd, sunway construction group bhd, press metal bhd, airasia bhd and ihh healthcare bhd.  chris eng\nhead of research, products and alternative investments\ninvestment management divisionetiqa insurance and takaful cimb group holdings bhd\ncimb group holdings bhd would be a stock worth looking at due to its price factor. its share price has fallen substantially over the past few years. compared with five years ago when it was trading at rm7.58 on july 15, 2011, cimbs share price has dropped as much as 43.8% to close at rm4.20 last friday, with 9.89 million shares traded, with a market capitalisation of rm36.66 billion. year to date, cimbs share price has dropped 4% from rm4.44 on dec 31, 2015. the banking group saw its net profit jump 40.3% year-on-year to rm813.8 million or 9.54 sen per share for the first quarter ended march 31, 2016, from rm580.12 million or 6.9 sen per share in the previous year, on lower costs and provisions. cimbs revenue or operating income for the period rose 1.2% to rm3.73 billion from rm3.68 billion a year prior. geographically, cimb said that profit contribution from its non-malaysian operations increased to 26% compared with 20% in the previous year, due to better performance from indonesia, in line with lower provisions at cimb niaga. losses incurred in indonesia should also be less of a drag given the write-downs and provisions it has made in the past. the stock should also see a rebound as and when foreign interest returns to malaysia, given its low valuation and status as a liquid blue chip.  tenaga nasional bhd tenaga nasional bhds (tnb) status as a liquid blue chip makes it an attractive stock pick. tnb shares closed at rm14.32 last friday, with 6.95 million shares traded and with a market capitalisation of rm80.82 billion. in a period of one year, tnb shares have appreciated by 15.4% from rm12.39 a year ago. year to date, its shares have been up 8.1% from rm13.23 on dec 31, 2015. there is a limited downside to tnbs business model as malaysias national electric utility. the fuel cost pass through mechanism seems well in place in malaysia and demand for electricity should remain decent, although not spectacular, for the remainder of the year. demand for industry electricity should be weak but offset by demand from the commercial side with a huge number of new malls being opened. tnb announced on may 9 that it will subscribe to a 30% equity interest in indias gmr energy ltd for us$300 million (rm1.2 billion), which is presently under the control of gmr infrastructure ltd, one of the largest diversified infrastructure conglomerates in india. the investment is in line with the groups five-year international expansion roadmap, which is targeted to secure new generation capacity internationally. earlier in april, tnb completed the acquisition of a 30% stake in turkey-based power producer gama enerji for us$255 million.  bimb holdings bhd bimb holdings bhds current 1.65 times financial year ending dec 31, 2016 (fy16) price-to-book value (pbv) is relatively attractive considering its industry-leading return on equity (roe) of 16%. public bank bhd, for example, with similar roe dynamics trades at 2.3 times pbv. our gordon growth-derived target price of rm4.40 (1.85 times 2016 forecast pbv underpinned by an roe of 16%) implies 11.9 times 2016 forecast price-earnings ratio and a dividend yield of 3.4%. we believe the stock deserves to trade at a premium to the industrys pbv of 1.15 times, given its far superior roe of 16% versus the industrys 10.3%. this is further reinforced by stronger islamic banking structural long-term growth prospects in tandem with the governments initiatives to cement malaysia as a leading global islamic finance hub. bimb also boasts a relatively stronger liquidity profile, with a common equity tier 1 of 12%, compared with the industrys 10.8%, and a loan-to-deposit ratio of 87%, compared with the industrys 89%, as well as a significantly higher loan loss coverage ratio of 200% versus the industrys 94%. as the only pure syariah-compliant islamic financial institution listed on bursa malaysia, bimb is likely to be a prime beneficiary of the eventual launch of the employees provident funds first fully syariah-compliant fund by january 2017, which will have an initial capital of rm100 billion to rm120 billion. existing anecdotal evidence suggests that fully syariah-compliant public listed companies in other sectors, which typically comprise mainly non-syariah-complaint companies such as real estate investment trusts (reits) and insurance companies, tend to trade at a 10% to 20% premium to conventional peers. cases in point are the likes of al-salam reit, klcc staple reit and syarikat takaful malaysia bhd. bimb has the third-lowest gross impaired loan ratio in the industry at 0.94% (industry: 1.65%) and the highest loan loss coverage ratio at 200% (industry: 94%). this, coupled with its superior projected loan growth of 11% versus the industrys 6%, places the group in a strong position to weather asset quality and growth challenges that the industry is currently facing. bimb shares closed down 0.5% at rm3.96 last friday. year to date, its share price has appreciated by 4.4% from rm3.83 on dec 31, 2015.  vincent khoo\nhead of research for malaysia\nuob kay hian kerjaya prospek group bhd kerjaya prospek group bhd currently trades at a 2017 forecast price-earnings ratio (per) of 10 times, 30% below its peers average per of 13 times. we believe the stock should trade at a premium to its current valuations given its ability to deliver significantly superior building construction margins compared with its peers of 5% to 7%. the group is able to deliver superior margins compared with its peers as it takes the mivan shuttering construction method, which requires significantly lower labour requirements by only using one-third of conventional construction methods labour requirements and significantly shorter construction period of seven to 10 days per floor compared with 10 to 14 days for other contractors. kerjayas outstanding order book is at rm2.4 billion, which would be able to last it for the next three years. year to date, the group has secured about rm666 million of new orders, surpassing its rm600 million target. however, we believe that the group may be able to easily surpass our rm700 million estimate as it is tendering for several construction jobs, whose outcomes are expected to be favourable to kerjaya. kerjayas attractive valuations, good visibility of new contract wins and huge cash pile of rm209 million, which is almost 20% of its market capitalisation of rm1.23 billion, would continue to support its positive share price performance. its shares closed up 0.04% at rm2.42 last friday. year to date, its shares have appreciated by 39.3% from rm1.63 on dec 31 last year.  gan kong yik\nchief investment officer\nkaf investment funds bhd lingakaran trans kota holdings bhd (litrak) in the current challenging market environment, given the low interest rate environment, we believe that investors should focus on high-yielding stocks to ride through the tough market. we pick lingakaran trans kota holdings bhd (litrak) because of its consistency in paying dividends every year. at the current price, it should offer about 4.5% yield based on historical payout, which is attractive given the current market environment, and valuation is not excessive looking at its forward earnings. with the recent scheduled toll rate hike, which led to higher free cash flows, litrak is poised to declare a higher dividend payout going forward. the traffic volume is normally stable, therefore earnings are consistent. earnings for the year ending march 31, 2017 would be much stronger year-on-year because it would reflect the full-year earnings on the recent scheduled toll rate hike from january 2016. we choose litrak because it fits into the current challenging market condition. this is due to its defensiveness in the nature of its business, consistency in earnings and generous dividend payouts. and it provides comfort to investors. furthermore, since litrak is the holding company of two established highways, namely damansara-puchong expressway and sprint expressway, major capital expenditure is not needed. shares in litrak remained unchanged to close at rm5.73 last friday, with a market capitalisation of rm3 billion.  chan ken yew\nhead of research\nkenanga research sunway construction group bhd we remain positive on the construction sector, banking on news flow of awards for the remaining packages of pan borneo highway, the mass rapid transit 2, at least 10 civil packages from the light rail transit 3 and 16 packages from the sungai besi-ulu klang elevated expressway, besides the damansara-shah alam elevated expressway, which we would be expecting from august 2016 onwards. hence, we are including big-cap contractors like sunway construction group bhd (suncon), which we initiated recently into our top pick for the third quarter of calendar year 2016. we like suncon for its strong execution track record, which positions it as one of the few major beneficiaries from the projects mentioned above. that said, we also like it for its strong balance sheet that has a strong net cash position of rm300 million, which shows minimal risks of a cash call compared with other contractors. for the first quarter ended march 31, 2016 (1qfy16), suncon posted a 15.5% fall in net profit to rm29.06 million from rm34.37 million a year ago, due to lower revenue and profit margin. quarterly revenue also fell 14.5% to rm424.35 million from rm496.07 million in 1qfy15, attributable to lower delivery volume of existing projects. suncon shares rose 1.85% or three sen to close at rm1.65 last friday, after 2.45 million shares changed hands, with a market capitalisation of rm2.13 billion.  ahmad ramzani ramli\nbanking & non-banking financial institutions analyst kenanga research aeon credit service (m) bhd while the general perception is that financial service providers are facing tougher times in growing their loan portfolios amid current economic condition, we understand loan demand from aeon credit service (m) bhds targeted customers, which are the retail market, is still resilient, especially since the recent opr cut. we are looking at gross financing receivables growth rates of 8% to 9% for the financial year ending feb 28, 2017 (fy17) and fy18. besides, we also like its healthy loan growth underpinned by decent asset quality, with non-performing loans expected to hover between 2% and 3%. it has healthy capital adequacy ratio, which is expected to be at a comfortable 20% versus bnms capital ratio requirement of 16%. aeon credits high return of equity of at least 20% in fy17 and fy18, as well as decent dividend yields of 4.9% to 5.3%, are better than other non-banking financial institutions as well as most banking stocks. moreover, valuation is also undemanding at 7.7 times of fy17 price-earnings ratio. shares in aeon credit settled at rm13.40 last friday, up eight sen or 0.6%, after 158,400 shares changed hands. it has a market capitalisation of rm1.93 billion.  shekhar jaiswal\naviation analyst\nrhb research airasia bhd airasia bhd remains our top pick for the aviation sector. both airasia and airasia x bhd should remain on track to report earnings growth and recovery in 2016. earnings growth for the two airlines continues to be aided by an improvement in demand and lower operating costs, especially from fully hedged lower fuel prices. airasias strong earnings growth and airasia xs return to profitability are largely driven by lower jet fuel prices. both airasia and airasia x have hedged the rest of the years fuel requirement at us$54 (rm219.24) per barrel (bbl), which is 28% to 33% lower than their 2015 average jet fuel price and also below the spot jet fuel price of us$58 per bbl. we expect jet fuel price to average us$60 per bbl in 2017 and, as airasia and airasia x had only hedged 13% to 14% of their 2017 jet fuel requirements until end of the quarter ended march 31, 2016, we estimate both airlines to report lower earnings next after a stellar 2016. we believe this provides a strong visibility of low operating costs, as the airlines continue to enhance load factors and push revenue yields higher. despite the recent sharp run-up in share prices, we believe valuations for airasia and airasia x remain compelling when compared with those of global low-cost carriers. nevertheless, several key risks are to be closely watched, including higher-than-estimated non-fuel operating costs, lower-than-expected revenue yields due to growing competition, and a slower-than-estimated recovery in earnings from associates and joint ventures. the counter has regained from its all-time low of 77 sen on aug 26 last year, rising as much as rm2 or 260% to close at its one-year high of rm2.85 last friday, after 12.55 million shares changed hands. the current price values it at rm7.93 billion.  ng sem guan\nbasic materials analyst\nrhb research press metal bhd press metal bhd, whose share price peaked at its all-time high of rm4.18 last monday, is one of the stocks that investors should consider to include back on their radar screens. the company is all set to make a comeback, with its phase ii aluminium smelter in samalaju having resumed normal operations late last year, coupled with the full commissioning of phase iii in may 2016. press metal commands 1.3% of global primary aluminium capacity and is currently in the first quartile of the global production cost curve. despite our conservative aluminium price assumption, we still expect a three-year forward earnings compounded annual growth rate of 26.4%. on july 11, press metal announced it was planning a share split involving the subdivision of its 50 sen shares into two shares of 25 sen each, and a bonus issue, as part of an internal reorganisation that will see a new entity assume its listed status. the bonus issue will be on the basis of two bonus shares for every five subdivided shares. subsequently, the group plans to exchange all its subdivided shares for shares in the new entity (newco) to transfer its listing status. at the close of trading hours last friday, press metals share price was trading at rm4.11, down six sen or 1.44%, giving it a market capitalisation of rm5.36 billion. the counter has gained 96.65% since the the start of the year.  syed muhammed kifnisyed kamaruddin\nhead of equity research\nmidf research ihh healthcare bhd ihh healthcare bhd is our top pick for the healthcare sector due to a strong earnings growth forecast of 21% to 23% for the financial year ending dec 31, 2016 (fy16) and fy17, its strong management team and robust balance sheet, as well as a well-diversified revenue base. at present, we believe there is potential for further upside to its earnings should the current condition improve in the 2h16. backed by strong demand and lack of public healthcare amenities, especially in urban areas, we opine that private healthcare operators will continue to be the preferred choice for urban dwellers with higher disposable income and insurance coverage. asias largest hospital operator by market capitalisation, ihh reported a 37.3% rise in its net profit for the first quarter ended march 31, 2016 to rm235.48 million from rm171.48 million a year ago, driven by robust growth in revenue. quarterly revenue was 23.6% higher at rm2.47 billion compared with rm2 billion a year earlier, due to the organic growth of existing operations and the commencement of operations of gleneagles kota kinabalu hospital in sabah, the acibadem taksim hospital in turkey, and the gleneagles medini hospital in johor. ihh shares closed unchanged at rm6.48 last friday, valuing it at rm53.34 billion. year to date, the stock has slipped 1.52%."}, "274": {"date_posted": "18/7/2016", "title": "hits and mostly misses in 1h16", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on july 18, 2016.  stocks in malaysia had a roller-coaster ride over the first half of the year (1h16) as the market reacted to concerns about ringgit depreciation, oil price declines, possible interest rate hike by the us federal reserve, the health of the chinese economy and risks of a global recession. malaysian companies 1h16 profits also disappointed, leading to further earnings cuts. the benchmark fbm klci lost about 6% of its value to 1,600.92 in 21 days in january as investors were unnerved by steep falls in chinese equity markets. the index has somewhat recovered since then, moving to 1,727.99 points on april 15 and closed at 1,668.40 last friday. as the market enters 2h16, meena lakshana and yimie yong took a look at how the 10 stock picks the edge financial daily featured on jan 4 fared in 1h16 and whether the analysts views remain unchanged.  sunway construction group bhd sunway construction group bhd (suncon), which was seen as the best proxy to the construction sector this year underpinned by a strong infrastructure pipeline, had seen its share price climb 21% this year to close at rm1.65 last friday, with a market capitalisation of rm2.13 billion. its strong outstanding order book of rm5 billion, which translates into 2.6 times of its revenue in the financial year ended dec 31, 2015, and expectations of more public infrastructure projects to be rolled out are keeping suncon on ta securities list of stock picks, with a target price of rm1.80. in a recent report, ta securities expects suncon to win as much as rm2.5 billion worth of jobs this year. this is supported by internal construction jobs of rm500 million to rm800 million a year (from sunway group) as bedrock orders. the research firm also pointed to suncons cash-rich balance sheet. the group has a net cash position of 23 sen per share. with the current net cash position and limited capital expenditure requirement, there is a potential upside to its dividend payout going forward, said ta securities. based on its minimum dividend payout of 35%, we expect suncon to offer reasonable dividend yield of about 3%. however, suncons earnings did not fare well in the first quarter ended march 31, 2016, falling 15.5% to rm29.06 million. its revenue shed 14.5% to rm424.5 million due to lower billings as some of the projects had reached or were near their completion stage.  inari amertron bhd year to date, inari amertron bhds share price had slipped 18% to close at rm2.96 last friday, with a market capitalisation of rm2.83 billion. the stock has been trading in a 52-week range of rm2.24 to rm3.96. in a note to clients on may 18, cimb equity research analyst mohd shanaz noor azam blamed the stocks decline on weak sentiment across the sector following the decline in apples iphone production and the strengthening of the ringgit against the us dollar. he believed inaris fundamentals remain intact given that its key customer, broadcom, expects radio frequency content in smartphones to grow by more than 20% per year over the next three years. moreover, inari is also diversifying its earnings stream with its latest venture into china, following an investment in pcl technologies. the research firm, which still counts inari as its top pick in the semiconductor sector, is maintaining its add call on inari, but with a lower target price of rm3.15 from rm3.65 previously. we expect inari to show stronger earnings growth in the fourth financial quarter ended june 30, 2016, driven by recovery in industry demand on the back of new smartphone launches in 2h16. therefore, we believe inari is still on track for another year of record profits in fy16, said mohd shanaz. ta securities technology analyst paul yap told the edge financial daily that a major smartphone launch in 2h16, inaris ramp-up of capacity to 680 testers by september and a weak ringgit, which the research firm forecasts to slip to rm4.20 by year end, are expected to boost inaris performance in 2h16.  ewein bhd year-on-year, ewein bhd has kept its earnings growth momentum going this year. mercury securities research head edmund tham said the penang-based property developer has been posting consistent earnings over the past few quarters. indeed, eweins growth numbers have been impressive, mainly driven by its property development business. purely based on recent results, its fundamentals are intact. it (earnings growth) looks sustainable, he told the edge financial daily. for the first quarter ended march 31, 2016, ewein posted a 514% increase in net profit to rm4.17 million on the back of a 108.23% jump in revenue to rm20.24 million, mainly due to recognition of profits from its city of dreams project in penang. ewein is jointly developing the rm800 million condominium project in bandar tanjong pinang with consortium zenith bucg sdn bhd. however, eweins share price movement does not reflect the earnings growth. year to date, the stock had tumbled 28% from rm1.28 on dec 31, 2015 to close at 92 sen last friday, valuing it at rm204.12 million.  sasbadi holdings bhd despite being in a business often seen as recession-proof, educational publisher sasbadi holdings bhd saw its quarterly net profit fall for the first time since its listing on the main market of bursa malaysia in july 2014, in the second financial quarter ended feb 29, 2016 (2qfy16). its net profit dropped 20% to rm6.64 million compared with rm8.34 million in 2qfy15, even though revenue rose 5% to rm33.86 million from rm32.11 million. it blamed the decrease in net profit on higher resources used for the textbook tender participation. in spite of the slightly tepid results, hong leong investment bank research continues to like sasbadi due to its strong annual free cash flow, high growth rate, its innovativeness in creating products that cater to technology-savvy youth and unique education exposure, which is closely linked to the countrys education system. in a report on june 20, its analyst mardhiah omar reiterated a buy call on sasbadi, with a target price of rm1.55, implying a potential 21% upside to its closing price of rm1.22 last friday. however, mardhiah said its earnings forecast for fy16 has been slightly reduced by 4% as the research firm believes that the group would be slightly affected by the weak purchasing power and tough business environment. hence, we are expecting a softer 2h16 for the group.  cahya mata sarawak bhd cahya mata sarawak bhd (cms), touted as one of the best proxies for the mega projects in sarawak, reported disappointing net profit in the first quarter ended march 31, 2016 (1qfy16). its earnings plunged 98% to rm1.05 million from rm57.42 million in 1qfy15, as revenue fell by 29% year-on-year and due to lower profit margin as well as share of substantial losses in associates. rhb research, which had a buy call on cms, has downgraded the stock to neutral as it cuts its earnings forecast for fy16 and fy17 by 14.8% and 7.6% respectively and lowers its target price (tp) to rm4.80 from rm5.86 initially. the tp still offers a 34% potential upside from last fridays closing price of rm3.58. year to date, however, cms has lost almost 30% of its value from rm5.09 on dec 31, 2015. in a report dated april 14, the research firm said cms subscription to rm110 million convertible preference shares in om materials (sarawak) sdn bhd suggested that the latters business environment may be more challenging than rhb research had initially projected. it continues to like cms as the best proxy to the rapid development activities in sarawak. we believe its medium- to longer-term outlook remains bright and cms could make a comeback as soon as 2h16, rhb research added.  ta ann holdings bhd ta ann holdings bhd, with its attractive dividend yield, high-growth businesses and undemanding valuation, is a top pick in 2016 for analysts. however, its first-quarter earnings were less than impressive, coming in below expectations of kenanga research plantation analyst voon yee ping and consensus, meeting only 11% and 9% of their core net profit estimates respectively. for the three months ended march 31, 2016 (1qfy16), ta ann posted a 53.7% decline in net profit to rm12.55 million on the back of a 1.6% decline in revenue to rm218.53 million. in a note to clients on may 20, voon said the company posted weak results in 1qfy16 due a 16% year-on-year (y-o-y) and an 8% y-o-y decline to us$221 (rm871) per cu m and us$469 per cu m in log and plywood prices respectively, compounded by weaker production volume (logs and plywood declined 33% and 14% respectively). when contacted, voon said ta anns share price was also impacted by the stronger ringgit at the start of the year and its weaker production volumes. year to date, the share price had declined by 20% to close at rm3.29 last friday, with a market capitalisation of rm1.46 billion. however, voon is optimistic about ta ann moving forward as the ringgit has weakened since then and timber prices are expected to pick up. the ringgit closed at 3.9457 to the us dollar last friday. the first quarter was the worst for the year [in terms of timber prices], but with the weakening ringgit and timber prices improving things would be better going forward, she said. for the long term, she said ta anns palm oil segment will boost its earnings as its young oil palms are coming into years of higher production. the trees are six to seven years old on average. so over the next few years, ta anns plantation segment will be a better driver of its earnings.  karex bhd karex bhd, the worlds largest condom manufacturer by volume which was seen as a strong beneficiary of the weak ringgit against the us dollar, saw its fortunes turn when the local currency strengthened this year as it reported a huge net foreign exchange loss of rm5 million for the third financial quarter ended march 31, 2016 (3qfy16). this dragged its net profit down by 37% to rm9.63 million from rm15.21 million a year ago. while affin hwang capital remains upbeat about karexs strategic expansion into the high-margin own brand manufacturing (obm) segment, it said the longer gestation period could keep costs elevated for the time being, keeping margins expansion in check. as such, in its may 30 note on karex, affin hwang capital revised its estimates on karex downwards by 14% to 18% for financial year ended june 30, 2016 (fy16) to fy18 after taking into account the slower-than-expected ramp-up in the obm segment, among others. still, the research firm expects 4qfy16 core net profit to normalise to the region of rm15 million to rm20 million on weaker ringgit, while latex prices have eased back to around rm4.50 from rm5. successful expansion into the obm segment would be a key rerating catalyst. however, valuations look rich for now, it said, maintaining its hold call on karex with a rm2.32 target price. year to date, karexs share price has fallen 16% from rm2.75 on dec 31, 2015 to rm2.30 last friday, with a market capitalisation of rm2.31 billion.  tiong nam logistics holdings bhd tiong nam logistics holdings bhd extended its positive earnings streak into the first three months of the year, with its net profit up 3% to rm36.55 million from rm35.55 million a year ago. the better quarterly profit helped push up full-year earnings by 9% to rm79.62 million for the financial year ended march 31, 2016 (fy16) from rm72.88 million in fy15. for fy17, ta securities analyst tan kam meng expects the groups net profit to grow faster and see double-digit rate of growth. he is projecting a 14% increase in net profit to rm90.9 million in fy17 on increased warehouse storage capacity, jump in property revenue from its pinetree residence project and new property sales of rm129.7 million. in a report dated june 7, tan was of the view that tiong nam, being the largest land transportation and warehouse owner in malaysia, was trading at an inexpensive price-earnings ratio of 4.9 times to calendar year 2017 earnings per share forecast. this is unjustifiable given its strong earnings growth prospect. in addition, the establishment of a real estate investment trust in the near run could free up the groups resources and enhance its balance sheet quality, he said, initiating coverage on tiong nam with a buy recommendation and a rm1.82 target price, which implies a 12% potential upside to its closing price of rm1.62 last friday. year to date, the counter has risen 18%. tan also believes that the current soft market condition has little impact on tiong nams property segment, which has been focusing on niche development. the property segment contributed 23% to the groups total revenue in fy16. it noted that tiong nam will also be immune to higher land cost as it already owns 25 warehouses and has 253 acres (102ha) of undeveloped land bank.  bumi armada bhd a victim of the slowdown in the oil and gas sector, bumi armada bhd saw its net profit fall 67% to rm23.43 million in the first quarter ended march 31, 2016 (1qfy16) from rm72.05 million a year ago, along with its revenue which dropped by 25% year-on-year to rm430.77 million. in a report dated june 1, maybank investment bank bhd (maybank ib) said the 1qfy16 results came in below the research houses and consensus initial financial year forecasts, prompting it to cut its fy16 to fy18 earnings for bumi armada by 3% to 30%. it expects bumi armadas earnings to remain weak in 2qfy16 and 3qfy16, owing to the absence of earnings from one of the companys floating production storage and offloading (fpso) units called armada claire (which saw its contract terminated in march) and lower conversion works. however, maybank ib sees a recovery from 4qfy16 onwards as bumi armada recognises profits from its four other vessels  fpso angola, fsu malta, fpso kraken and fpso madura. the research firm is keeping its buy call on bumi armada, with an unchanged target price of rm1.05, adding that any share price weakness following the 1qfy16 results is an opportunity to accumulate. year to date, bumi armadas share price has lost 26% to close at 75 sen last friday, with a market capitalisation of rm4.4 billion.  skp resources bhd skp resources bhd continued its earnings growth momentum in 1h16, posting an 88% jump in net profit to rm21.68 million for the fourth quarter ended march 31, 2016 (4qfy16). revenue also rose 18% to rm231.97 million during the quarter. for the full fy16, it saw net profit jump 94% to rm82.15 million, coming in within kenanga researchs expectations. in a note dated may 31, kenanga research analyst desmond chong said the plastic moulding companys long-term earnings prospects remained resilient anchored by two long-term contracts awarded by uk-based appliance manufacturer dyson ltd, with targeted sales contribution of rm1 billion per year on cordless vacuum cleaners. he is maintaining his outperform call on the stock, with a marginally lower target price of rm1.72 from rm1.76 previously. however, the brexit vote last month sparked concern about the prospect of skp resources on the sale of dyson products. the us is its biggest market, followed by japan in terms of sales and profits. still, an analyst who declined to be named said it is too early to gauge the impact of brexit on skp resources, adding that sales weakness from the european union would be made up by the growing demand for cordless vacuum cleaners in asia. compared with its closing price of rm1.31 on dec 31, 2015, skp resources share price has fallen by 6% to close at rm1.23 last friday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm1.44 billion."}, "275": {"date_posted":

buying a seemingly undervalued stock is the fear that its price will go even lower. in this report, we argue that in the long run, utility stocks with cheap valuations offer higher returns to investors than those with rich valuations. our analyses show that the stocks with relatively cheaper valuations  tenaga nasional bhd (tnb), ytl power international bhd and cypark resources bhd  not only offer more favourable risk-reward, but also stronger long-term earnings growth prospects than petronas gas bhd, malakoff corp bhd and gas malaysia bhd. utility stocks under our coverage can be roughly divided into two camps. firstly, those with earnings uncertainty or ambiguity, such as tnb, ytl power and cypark, trade at only nine to 16 times calendar year 2017 forecast (cy17f) price-earnings ratio (per). secondly, those with historically stable and predictable earnings, such as petronas gas, malakoff and gas malaysia, trade at steep valuation levels of 17 to 24 times cy17f per. our analyses show that the valuations of stocks in the former camp will still be on par, if not cheaper, than those of stocks in the latter camp even if all the key earnings risks of the former materialise. this, coupled with the probability that the earnings risks may never happen, means that the former group offers far superior risk-reward than the latter. on top of that, tnb, ytl power and cypark have stronger earnings growth prospects than petronas gas, malakoff and gas malaysia. companies in the former camp, in our opinion, operate in an environment where there is an abundance of horizontal expansion opportunities. we believe cheap utility stocks could react more strongly to positive news than to negative news as positive news gives the market a reason to buy the stocks, while the impact of negative news is buffered by their already-cheap valuations. tnb remains our top pick for the sector as its valuation is not only relatively cheaper, it also has a strong potential near-term rerating catalyst. tnb currently trades at only 10.8 times cy17f per and may raise its dividend payout as part of its initiative to optimise its capital structure.  cimb research, july 13"},

policy rate cut to 3%, the ringgit firmed against the us dollar at 3.9470. brent crude oil declined to us$45.10 per barrel. the fbm klci rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014), and it represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,671.82 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,503.68 (low), 1,727.41 (high), 1,600.92 (low), 1,729.13 (high) and 1,611.88 (low). the indexs price bars are now above the 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages (smas), and this depicts a minor upward phase for the fbm klci in the short term. medium- to longer-term prospects look bleaker as the weekly 50-day and 200-day smas issued a dead cross in november 2015. any bargain hunting on the index may be met with heavy longer-term selling on rallies. the indexs daily indicators are all positive, with its commodity channel index (cci), directional movement index (dmi), moving average convergence divergence (macd), oscillator and stochastic issuing obvious buy signals. as such, the indexs obvious support levels are seen at 1,611, 1,640 and 1,652, while very heavy liquidation at the resistance areas of 1,654, 1,684 and 1,729 will cap the indexs rise. due to the better tone for the fbm klci, we are recommending a chart buy on tiong nam logistics holdings bhd. tiong nam provides warehousing, transportation services, cold room services and leases properties. maybank ib does not cover tiong nam on a fundamental basis. tiong nams historical price-earnings ratio is at a low 8.7 times and a fair price-to-book ratio of 1.14 times. its dividend yield remains at a good 2.4%. there has been no obvious news on this stock since may 2016. tiong nams chart trend in the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is firmly up. from a monthly wave 2 low of eight sen (april 2009), its share price has surged on a wave 3 move to an all-time high of rm1.67 (july 2016). as its share price broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of rm1.42 and rm1.50, look to buy tiong nam on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term uptrend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) have issued very obvious buy signals, and now show firm and obvious indications of tiong nams eventual surge towards much higher levels. it would attract very firm buying activities at the support levels of rm1.42, rm1.50 and rm1.66. we expect tiong nam to

"article": " this article first appeared in personal wealth, the edge malaysia weekly, on june 21 - june 27, 2016.  it is important that investors look beyond companies earnings in challenging times and take into account the managements long-term vision and execution capabilities, says eastspring investments bhd ceo raymond tang. profits are a reflection of how management is responding to the market. if you only look at a companys earnings, you are already two steps behind. knowing what managers focus on and their execution style is important, he says. tang looks at companies with long-term, sustainable business models that can provide profit certainty in any economic cycle  those with relatively conservative expansion plans and very low debt levels. he cites the example of an oil and gas company that appeared on his radar screen before the 2008 global financial crisis. i asked management why its competitors were borrowing a lot of money to expand their offshore facilities, and why hadnt the company? they told me that they didnt believe in borrowing, as the best time to borrow could turn out to be the worst  if credit tightened again and cash flow was squeezed, it would hurt the company. i also asked why the company was not competing with those going offshore and had a lot of projects. they said were not doing so because the weather was not something they could control. if you have an offshore platform and the weather condition does not allow it to operate, you will still have to pay the rental cost of the equipment. so, it is not about your ability but the weather. and the management would rather make plans in areas where it had more certainty. this is a very different philosophy and business approach. knowing how they run the company, i know it will never go bankrupt. the company was cash-rich at the time. this was in 2006 or 2007 when many exploration and production companies saw their share price double or triple. this company is doing very well now while others have seen their valuations fall. we look at certainty in terms of outcome or profits. this means these companies have to be consistent in delivering profit and have less volatile profit levels and share prices. tang says his team will continue to look at companies in asia because despite the challenging global economy, the region is still expected to have an average growth of 6% this year. asia is still a growing market. although its growth is slower than the 8% to 10% of the past few years, it is 2% to 2.5% higher than the us. we continue to look at growth and are identifying the sectors and companies that are adapting [to the new economic cycle]. these companies have to be nimble to rejig their product offerings so they can gain market share.  refining portfolios in a new cycle tang, who has been chairman of the malaysian association of asset managers since 2008, has more than 20 years experience in managing funds. he spent 11 years at cimb-principal asset management and served as chief investment officer for asean from 2011 to 2015. one of his main tasks since taking the helm at eastspring has been to refine its portfolio of local funds to make it relevant to the current investment cycle. what worked in the previous cycle may not work in the next. thus, we are refining and enhancing the investment models of our funds, says tang. small-cap stocks have outperformed in the last three years. before that it was the large caps that outperformed. that means the risks and returns can be very different in each cycle. he says refining the companys balanced funds is one way of making them more relevant to investors. this includes adding more real estate investment trusts (reits) to its portfolio. reits are becoming popular. it is an asset class that provides investors with a strong and stable income stream. for our balanced funds, we will have a heavier reit component in the equity portion of the portfolio. this is one way of enhancing yield while having low volatility, says tang. he and his team plan to make more company visits to look for those that can grow market share in challenging times like these. you need to be one or two steps ahead to find these companies. it is important to spot opportunities and execute before the others find out about them. so, this means going to the ground more often, making more company visits to find good companies, he says. in every cycle, there are companies that benefit from that cycle. for instance, when the ringgit is weak, the importers suffer. but exporters are able to capitalise on the weaker currency to grow global market share such as the rubber glove companies. tang also plans to offer investors more regional and global products. there arent enough global offerings here. some of them are managed by non-related external parties. by having internally managed [regional and global products], we can offer our retail and institutional investors more options, he says. eastspring has a proven track record. it has won the award for best equity group at the edge-thomson reuters lipper fund awards for the last three consecutive years. however, most of its regional and global funds had underperformed their benchmark (as at april). tang says his team will work more closely with its regional partners and the managers of those funds to address this issue. there will be continuous engagement with our colleagues in singapore on how our regional and global products are doing  what we have done right and how we can do better.  property sector looking attractive eastspring investments bhd ceo raymond tang says the malaysian stock markets performance is expected to be capped, owing to macroeconomic headwinds. malaysias equity performance will be capped in the near term as the market is focusing on external headwinds such as a potential us federal reserve interest rate hike. corporate earnings are expected to be lower in the second half of the year, in line with slowing global growth. analysts tend to start the year on a more bullish note because it is a new year and everything looks rosy and they feel more confident. but earnings expectations will get cut moving forward compared with what we have seen in the last two years. the environment is very challenging and it is hard to see earnings move upwards in the short term, says tang. meanwhile, he does not foresee oil prices rising above us$50 per barrel this year owing to the huge supply that is expected to come into the market. green technology is another factor that will keep oil prices low. as oil prices edged up, everybody said that at us$50 per barrel, us shale oil producers will begin to pump again. but because of the tenuous financial situation in venezuela, nigeria and russia, these countries will also pump out as much oil as they can. so, there is a bias towards higher supply [than demand] and oil prices will remain weak, says tang. also, everybody is more eco-conscious today and green technology is gaining traction. there is anecdotal evidence that tesla motors [which produces electric cars] is having its best year. crude palm oil (cpo) stocks, he says, have limited upside. meanwhile, the valuations of property stocks are cheap but sales will not be picking up in short term. the cpo sector has cooled in terms of share price over the past year and we have not had any newsflow coming out of the sector. when cpo prices fell, the [share] prices of these companies did not come down much. they are relatively more expensive than normal and the upside could be limited, says tang. the prices of property stocks are beginning to look attractive. but when we talk to the people on the ground, we found that property companies are scaling back their projects. the question is, has this been factored into their share prices? forward sales will be lower than this year. nobody has seen much clarity in the short term, but we will start accumulating property stocks again when we think the cycle is near its bottom. tang is underweight on the telecoms sector because telcos have been facing intense competition lately, which is largely reflected in the larger data packages being given out to users for free. in challenging times like these, tangs advice to investors is to stretch their investment view to three years instead of the next 6 to 12 months. some sectors or companies would only look attractive with a longer investment horizon. he also says investors could pay attention to equity income funds or high-dividend-yield stocks this year. given the low interest rate environment and negative policy rate for some countries such as japan, the income-oriented strategy and yield type of funds may continue to attract buying interest. investors should pay attention to equity income funds or high-yield stocks."}, "279": {"date_posted": "4/7/2016", "title": "myegs illegal foreign worker

registration was weaker than expected. we estimated as at last thursday, my eg services bhd (myeg) only registered around 300,000 ifws, 70% below our one million target. the government is targeting higher registration of ifws. it is unlikely, in our view, that the government would stop the rehiring programme until it meets a certain target. we have assumed in our earnings forecast that the government would reach registration of one million ifws by financial year ending june 30, 2017 (fy17). this would mean myeg would register an additional 700,000 ifws in fy17, which is possible. myeg has indicated in the past its management would not be able to handle the registration of ifws and the launch of the goods and services tax (gst) monitoring project at the same time. we expect the rehiring programme to continue for another few months and the launch of the gst monitoring project to be postponed from july 2016 to january 2017, a six- month delay. the gst monitoring project phase one, which involves installation of its dongles at 50,000 food and beverage (f&b) outlets nationwide, should start in january 2017. myeg gets paid rm1,000 per f&b outlet annually. phase two, which involves installation of its dongles at 500,000 retail outlets nationwide, should start one year after the start of phase one. in phase two, myeg also gets paid rm1,000 per retail outlet annually. in our earnings forecast, we have assumed gst monitoring project phase one to start in january 2017 and phase two to start in january 2018. we cut fy16 to fy18 forecast earnings per share (eps) by 20% to

the region still has plenty of potential for investors. patrick chang, chief investment officer at cimb-principal asset management bhd, says the regions economic growth, as a result of growing affluence and infrastructure spending, coupled with healthy dividend yields, makes it an attractive investment destination.  chang says today governments can either stimulate the economy through monetary stimulus such as rate cuts or fiscal policy expansion. the beauty of the us$120 oil price coming down to us$30 per barrel is that inflation expectations are very low in asean. some countries such as indonesia have cut interest rates by 75 basis points this year to stimulate their economies. they also need to stimulate the broader economy from a fiscal point of view. he points out that countries such as indonesia, thailand, malaysia and the philippines will embark on very loose fiscal policies to stimulate their economies. in turn, they will spend on infrastructure and tourism in the next decade. they will spend more money on infrastructure for several reasons. now that the commodity boom is over, these governments need infrastructure spending to support growth. if they dont improve on infrastructure, they will lose out on fdi and tourism. with fdi moving from china to asean, these governments will need the hard assets to attract foreign investors and tourists, says chang. the significant benefit of spending to improve infrastructure is the multiplier effect. people would think that infrastructure spending means mega projects such as highways, airports and railways. it is not necessarily the case. we have to factor in the multiplier effect, he says, giving the example of roads in countries such as thailand, indonesia and the philippines, many of which are not in good condition. the road maintenance projects to repair potholes and pavement cracks will be awarded to contractors. this kind of projects has a huge market. for less developed asean countries such as myanmar and cambodia, better airports, roads and facilities will take time to build. tourism is one of the soft assets in these countries and it is a multi-year story  it will take three to five years. these countries will need proper hard assets to tap it, says chang, adding that supportive monetary policy, fiscal spending and tourism are what will keep aseans growth engine going. within asean, the only market that cimb-principal asset management does not have exposure to is vietnam. but that will change soon as chang is looking very closely at the country and has personally invested in it over the past five years. china remains on the radar screen for chang as he likes its new economy. we like [existing] companies that have increased automation, robotic and e-commerce capabilities. these sectors are the reason we are bullish on china. he says. the power of smartphones has made a lot of things more accessible. this is the biggest disruptor out there. it has changed the consumption pattern of people, from going to a mall to buying everything online using alipay and tenpay. from a sector perspective, chang likes healthcare as it gives the fund house good exposure to the ageing economy in countries such as thailand, which even exports healthcare services to emerging markets such as laos, vietnam and myanmar. one such example is bangkok dusit medical services (bdms), which is one of the cimb-principal asean total return funds top holdings, owns and operates six hospitals in thailand and two in cambodia. bdms network includes thailand-based national healthcare systems co ltd, the largest and most advanced blood analysis centre in the country, and bangkok helicopter services, which is southeast asias first medical evacuation provider. in 2015, bdms was ranked no 5 in the world for revenue, recording us$1.8 billion. bloomberg data shows that the stock closed at thb24 on june 14, a 24.63% increase from a year ago, giving the company a market capitalisation of thb368.7 billion. the cimb-principal asean total return fund, which was launched in march last year, has outperformed its peers in the ringgit malaysia category. according to morningstar, the fund had delivered a one-year return of 6.3% as at june 9. according to the fund factsheet, as at end-april, the funds asset allocation was mostly in the industrial sector (23.86%), followed by consumer goods (11.88%) and trading/services (11.54%). the fund had invested mostly in indonesian stocks (28.16%), followed by malaysian counters (21.57%) and thai equities (21.27%). the funds top five holdings were telekomunikasi tbk pt (indonesia), airports of thailand pcl (thailand), sino thai engineering and construction pcl (thailand), bangkok dusit medical services (thailand) and ihh healthcare bhd (malaysia). going forward, chang says the process-driven, high conviction view of the fund house will see it continue being agile in its investment decisions. our funds did very well last year because we took the initiative to be out of the old economy sectors in china, including banks, commodities and energy. these helped us to outperform. he says the fund house likes internet and automation companies that will benefit from the so-called fourth industrial revolution. this refers to the current trends in automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies such as cyber-physical systems, the internet of things and cloud computing.  time to look at malaysia, says mobius mark mobius, executive chairman of templeton emerging markets group at franklin templeton investments (picture), believes that the negative interest rate policies in japan and europe are goodnews for emerging markets. i was looking into singapore reits, some of which give 7% to 8% yield, which is incredible. you also see companies in malaysia with much better yields on value. we are in a situation where a lower interest rate policy is good for emerging markets, says mobius, who spoke at the recent cimb preferreds 100th financial advisory series. he says investors should consider investing in malaysian stocks mainly for their low price-to-book value ratios and significant currency undervaluation. according to his estimate, the ringgit was 24% undervalued against the us dollar in april. the currency undervaluation was calculated using the purchasing power parity of the country versus the us, with a base date of january 1990. when you have this down trend, it will eventually go back up. we are seeing it happening already. it is not a bad idea to hold on to the ringgit because usually, the currency does not stay down long. if you believe commodity prices are bottoming out, the future looks pretty good for the ringgit, says mobius. he believes that the ringgit is at the lowest end against the us dollar as it is the highest percentage he has seen compared with many other asian currencies. the asian financial crisis [which saw the ringgit slump to a record 4.88 per us dollar] was a very unusual situation for malaysia. [the then prime minister tun] mahathir shut the window for people taking the ringgit out of the country, and malaysia was the only country in asia to do so. it destroyed the whole situation as it looked very bad in the offshore market. i hope that wont happen again. mobius says investors should take a longer view on sectors and countries to invest in and always diversify their portfolios. let me tell you what i have in my portfolio to give you an idea. i have 70% in equities  80% in asia and 20% in global markets  about 15% in fixed income, 5% in gold, palladium and platinum, and the rest in property. i allocate 70% to equities because in many cases, equities yield better than bonds. i think the weighting should [be maintained at this level]. for example, if your equity portfolio goes up to 80%, it will be a good idea to take profit, cut back and put it somewhere else. you need to keep watching and adjusting your portfolio. he says gold and precious metals become very attractive in a negative interest rate environment. it is not a bad idea to hold gold as this asset class has no yield. i think we will see a shift into precious metals going forward. according to marketwatch, gold prices hit levels not seen in weeks on june 13, as investors sought safety in the precious metal amid concerns over the brexit referendum and some high-profile central bank meetings. gold for august delivery rose 0.9% to settle at us$1,286.90 an ounce, marking the highest settlement since may 6. mobius says that out of the last 28 years, the emerging markets index has outperformed the world index for 17 years. on the msci emerging markets index, the longest bear markets declined 49% and lasted for 17 months while the longest bull market increased 619% and lasted for 116 months, he points out, adding that investors should stay invested in a bear market. he also shares a story on investment advice. many years ago, a young lady asked our founder john templeton when she should invest. john said the best time to invest is when she has money. he sounded like a mutual funds salesman. but what john really meant was you could be investing in a bear market or a bull market, but in the long run, you are going to be in good shape because the bear market is very short. buy more during the bear period and you will do very well over the longer term. value emerging in asean (pt 1)"}, "281": {"date_posted": "30/6/2016", "title": "value emerging in asean (pt 1)", "article": " this article first appeared in personal wealth, the edge malaysia weekly, on june 20 - june 26, 2016.  against a backdrop of negative yields globally, the region still has plenty of potential for investors. patrick chang, chief investment officer at cimb-principal asset management bhd, says the regions economic growth, as a result of growing affluence and infrastructure spending, coupled with healthy dividend yields, makes it an attractive investment destination.  asean economies will continue to outperform as they are healthier than those in north asia such as china. they also offer some of the highest dividend yields in the world, says patrick chang, chief investment officer at cimb-principal asset management bhd. asean economies are outperforming not only because of their higher dividend yields but also because they are relatively healthier than the north asian economies. although their currencies were bashed down last year when the us dollar strengthened, they are getting stronger now. the emerging markets in asean such as thailand, indonesia and the philippines will provide higher growth and higher earning companies, so this is a good opportunity to invest in the region, he tells personal wealth on the sidelines of the cimb preferreds 100th financial advisory series recently. according to bloomberg data as at june 15, the msci southeast asia had a dividend yield of 3.11% for the one-year period  more than the msci emerging markets, msci ac asia ex japan and msci world, which had yields of 2.85%, 2.85% and 2.75% respectively. chang is an asean markets specialist with 22 years experience. he is bullish on the region as he sees value emerging in these markets. if we look at the return on equity (roe) versus price-to-book value in asean over the last 15 years, we can see that the big jump since 2009 had been generated by a few factors, including the huge commodity boom from 2009 to 2011. in may 2013, the roe began to drop and it is now at 2009 levels, he says. we live in a world where japan and europe have negative yields, so investors in these countries can no longer keep their money in the bank. they need more returns. the yields in asean are much higher in the eyes of the europeans and japanese, so they will invest in these countries, says chang. that is the reason cimb-principal has added higher-yield companies to its malaysian and asean portfolios, he says. investors can look at real estate investment trusts, utilities and infrastructure-related companies to get higher dividend yields. a bloomberg article dated may 31 says japans investments in asean last year exceeded those in china and hong kong for the third year running. meanwhile, according to bank of japan data, its asean investments had tripled to u00a520.1 trillion from five years ago. the higher inflows were attributed to push and pull factors such as aseans low labour costs, low per capita income and relatively young population. also, tensions reduced chinas appeal in the eyes of some japanese businesses, causing them to explore other markets. the european union is one of aseans largest sources of foreign direct investment (fdi).  aspirational buying to boost industries asean is poised to become an economic powerhouse, making it an attractive region for investors. according to a mckinsey & co 2014 report, it would be the seventh largest economy in the world if it were a single country, based on its gdp of us$2.4 trillion in 2013. asean is expected to be the fourth largest economy by 2050, says the report. chang likes the long-term consumption trend in asean. he believes that gdp per capita will continue to rise and wages will increase in middle-income countries. these bode well for some companies, especially for automotive, cosmetic and luxury brands. aspirational buying across asean is huge. going forward, this is what middle-class consumption will be like. the beauty of this is that with smartphones, people can spend online easily. it has nothing to do with gdp, interest rates and all the noise you hear in the market. i think this is a very structural story, says chang. he cites an example of a rising affluent population where people plan to increase their aspirational buying over time. for example, he says, these people would buy toblerone chocolate once in a while instead of buying their usual low-quality milk chocolate all the time. if you are poor, your aspirational buying will increase. and this is the biggest phenomenon in terms of consumption among the middle class across asean. about 20 years ago, people used nokia. but today, in emerging markets such as the philippines, everyone wants an [apple] iphone. they are not earning a lot, but they will save just to buy an iphone. it is the same when it comes to owning a vehicle, he says. when people buy pick-up trucks in the philippines, their ultimate goal is the toyota hilux. that is why toyota has 40% market share in the country. but eventually, this market share will erode as the country brings in other high-end brands such as lexus and bmw. for example, philippine-based universal robina corp (urc)  which produces consumer goods such as flour, sugar, beverages, snacks, biscuits and candy  bought into new zealands largest snack food producer griffins foods for us$608 million in mid-2014 to gain access to premium brands. according to the nikkei asian review, urc also formed a joint venture with japan-based calbee inc in 2014 to launch the latters potato snacks in the philippines. as at june 14, urc shares were trading at 194.10 peso on the philippine stock exchange.  high-growth markets chang says asean today can be grouped into developing countries, such as singapore and thailand, and emerging countries such as laos, vietnam and myanmar. cimb-principal asset management has structured its asean portfolio to include overweight high-growth markets such as the philippines, indonesia and thailand. the political risks in the philippines have subsided, and it has become one of the most underleveraged economies in the region. the country has the largest business process outsourcing (bpo) business in the world. jp morgan and wells fargo have set up bpo centres in manila and cebu. the services provided include call centres to accounting and webpage creation. foreign direct investment will continue to come in as long as the labour cost is relatively cheap compared with chinas, he says. chang likes indonesia and is hopeful that its tax amnesty bill will pass. the bill  designed to make it attractive for tax evaders to come clean, declare and repatriate their funds  will be the biggest driver of consumption and the infrastructure boom as the governments coffers grow. we like thailand because it is the epicentre of indochina and will be the major supply chain for the whole region. so, this gives us exposure to the supply chain for many sectors, says chang, adding in jest that the country is also his favourite holiday destination. according to bloomberg data as at june 14, while the philippine stock exchanges psei index was offering a year-to-date return of 6.88% and the jakarta composite index had delivered a year-to-date return of 4.79%, the thailand set 50 index had provided a year-to-date return of 11.44%. in the first four months of this year, asean outperformed the rest of asia and the developed markets, says chang. he points out that normally emerging markets do well when the us dollar is weak. the outperformance of the asean market was caused by a few things. first, the us dollar found a little of its bottom; it is coming off a very high base. the prices of commodities such as oil have also rebounded, which is good news for asean as many of them, such as indonesia, malaysia and thailand, are commodity exporters. chang thinks the markets are in the process of adjustment and need recalibration in terms of things like interest rate expectation. overall, asia is in a very low growth environment. the slowing down of china  the biggest market in asia  impacts asean, especially when most of us are suffering from the commodity boom-bust cycle, although prices have started to stabilise, he says. value emerging in asean (pt 2)"}, "282": {"date_posted": "23/6/2016",

friday. the market rebounded last friday on bargain hunting. trading volume declined as the uncertainty in the markets made players stay on the sidelines. the average daily trading volume last week was only 1.5 billion shares, compared with 1.8 billion shares two weeks ago. foreign institutions continued to exit from the local market as ringgit weakened. net selling from foreign institutions last week was rm912 million. net buying from local institutions and local retailers were rm598 million and rm314 million respectively. the ringgit slightly strengthened against the us dollar from

this simply indicated that market confidence remained weak. the trend was bearish as the index was below both the short- and long-term 30- and 200-day moving averages. the index was also below the ichimoku cloud indicator. momentum indicators were indicating a stronger bearish momentum developed in the past one week. the relative strength index indicator was below its mid-level and the moving average convergence divergence indicator below its moving average. the index fell from the top band to the bottom band of the bollinger bands indicator. furthermore, the ichimoku cloud indicator was getting thicker and this indicated that we should be expecting stronger resistance. the fbm klci was back to the sideways range before the rebound two weeks ago, which was between 1,610 and 1,640 points. the index was near the support level and hence we expect some technical rebound this week. however, we expect the rebound in the market to be met with selling pressure as sentiment still has not improved and the trend is still bearish. after failing to break above the resistance level at 1,660 points two weeks ago, market sentiment is still bearish. in the short term, the fbm klci is expected to stay between 1,610 and 1,640 points until the brexit situation settles. benny lee is chief market strategist for jupiter securities sdn bhd. jupiter securities is a participating broker in

instalment of the billion ringgit club (brc), where they will be judged not only in terms of profit but in corporate responsibility (cr) as well. we are looking forward to unveiling the best-performing companies over the past three years in the various categories on aug 15, says ho kay tat, publisher and group chief executive officer (ceo) of the edge media group. stepping in to sponsor the brc this year are ocbc bank (m) bhd, swiss luxury watchmaker jaeger- lecoultre, qatar airways and mercedes-benz malaysia. i thank ocbc, jaeger-lecoultre and qatar airways for their continuous support of brc and welcome mercedes-benz back as our partner, ho adds. it is these partnerships that enable us to carry on with this prestigious corporate awards event. banking giant ocbc has been the main sponsor of brc since its inception in 2010. ocbc senior vice-president and head of corporate and commercial banking jeffrey teoh says ocbc is happy to support the edge media group in this event as it is something that is worthwhile and right to do. the recognition given to the winners of the various categories this year is a testament to their ability to achieve profitability in a tough global environment and commitment to corporate objectives and corporate conscience, he adds. the edge billion ringgit club has etched for itself a position as a holistic gold standard for the ranking of the top publicly-listed billion-ringgit companies in malaysia, built on the power of sustained relationships and their commitment to giving back to society. jaeger-lecoultres passion for corporate responsibility ties in perfectly with brcs objectives as well, which is why it is sponsoring the event for the second time. since 2008, it has worked tirelessly with united nations educational, scientific and cultural organization (unesco) to protect the 47 unesco world heritage marine sites. believing that ethics begins at home, the sourcing of all of jaeger-lecoultres diamonds, gold and leather are monitored carefully. besides that, it has stayed true to its origins by carefully controlling its expansion and meeting high standards in terms of construction, transport and energy, and water conservation. the ceo of the company of the year will receive a duomu00e8tre unique travel time watch, courtesy of jaeger-lecoultre. asserting itself as an absolute reference in terms of mechanical watchmaking, it is the first world-time watch that enables to-the-minute adjustment of the second time zone. this enables travellers to accurately set the second time zone for all continents and countries. the watch is divided into two distinct mechanisms: the first is devoted to displaying the local time and the second to showing the time in another time zone. each mechanism has a 50-hour power reserve and, to achieve ideal user-friendliness, the same crown serves to wind both barrels. coming back to sponsor the brc for the second time  the first was in 2010  is mercedes-benz malaysia, which relentlessly pursues its ambition to be the best or nothing. like companies in the brc, mercedes-benz malaysia seeks to uphold its innovative spirit and strives for perfection. this prestigious award, which recognises malaysian corporations par excellence, is certainly in line with our practices of pursuing a high-performance culture and excelling in our respective business fields, says mark raine, vice-president of sales and marketing at mercedes-benz malaysia. qatar airways is a second-time sponsor of the brc as well. country manager of malaysia & brunei datuk muzammil mohamad says the brc symbolises quality and growth borne from hard work, something that qatar airways identifies itself very closely with. in 2015, it won airline of the year at skytrax, something muzammil says inspired its staff to excel in the airline service industry. the recognition of elite companies creates an atmosphere of healthy competition that benefits consumers while sending a credible third-party signal to customers as to which are the businesses they can trust, he says. the brc recognises companies with a market capitalisation of rm1 billion and above as at march 31. companies are added to the annual list automatically once they fulfil the requirements and are evaluated based on growth in profit before tax, returns to shareholders and cr commitments, among others. the brc awards include the value creator: malaysias outstanding ceo, the edge brc most profitable company, the edge brc highest profit growth company, the edge brc best performing stock, the edge brc best cr initiatives and the coveted company of the year award. previous winners of the value creator: malaysias outstanding ceo award were public bank group chairman tan sri teh hong

awc", "article": " this article first appeared in corporate, the edge malaysia weekly, on may 23 - 29, 2016.  for years, investors hardly looked at awc bhd. but that has changed now, thanks to its positive financial results and newsflow. year to date, the integrated facility management (ifm) companys share price has shot up 88.5%, hitting a historical high of 77 sen last wednesday before closing at 73.5 sen on thursday for a market capitalisation of rm188.4 million. it is as if the market suddenly realised awcs value, group ceo and managing director datuk ahmad kabeer mohamed nagoor tells the edge. as an established ifm service provider, awc has held the concession for maintaining 37 federal government buildings in the southern region of the country since 1998. its last contract, worth rm46 million a year, expired in 2013, creating uncertainty about its earnings, which put investors off. the company also chose not to pay any dividends for two financial years, prudently conserving cash in case its long-standing concession was not renewed. however, such worries were put to rest when it secured two new concessions this year. one of them is actually an extension of its existing concession but with improved terms for the provision of ifm services. this contract runs from jan 1 this year to december 2025, earning awc rm52 million per annum in the first five years and a higher rm59 million per annum for the remaining five years. the other contract is a rm145 million critical asset refurbishment programme that involves a 10-year concession to replace old mechanical and electrical equipment in government buildings. ahmad kabeer says these long-term contracts have given awc high earnings visibility and put it back in a position to pay dividends again. as at its first half ended dec 31, 2015 (1h2016), awc had cash of rm60.96 million or net cash per share of about 24 sen. at the same time, the company has begun to diversify the earnings base of its facility division. in fy2015, concession work represented 65% of the divisions income, falling from 75% the year before. today, awc counts among its clients the heriot-watt university malaysia, johors educity as well as high-rises like menara celcom and menara felda. more importantly, the company is making inroads into the lucrative healthcare sector where maintenance services are provided by a small and tight group of specialised companies. building on its earlier success in maintaining the cheras rehabilitation hospital and all state clinics in johor, awc won a rm90 million contract in march to maintain the 300-bed shah alam hospital for five years. this is the kind of track record that makes awc competitive when bidding for jobs involving government and private healthcare centres, remarks ahmad kabeer. this is the first time we managed to penetrate the healthcare market, going against strong players. now, we would like more play in the sector, which is more challenging and price-sensitive, with reasonable margins in the private and government hospitals u2026 we have the base and now we can take it to the next level on the hospital side. in its facility division alone, awc has an outstanding order book of rm272 million  which is much larger than its current market capitalisation of rm189.64 million  that will keep it busy until fy2018. an existing tender book of rm120 million, meanwhile, indicates more jobs can be expected. imagine all the buildings coming up in greater kuala lumpur, all that is in the pipeline. a lot of buildings are being planted. the whole space is going to change and there is a lot of play coming up for us. it is a challenge for the building maintenance industry to go up the value chain, to have competent and technical expertise and to have a service culture, ahmad kabeer says. i think awc can meet the challenge to move up and keep improving its service level for its clientele. although the facility division has an abundance of contracts and is awcs largest revenue contributor, a competitive market means profit margins are suppressed. in fy2015, the division raked in rm73.7 million or 58% of the companys turnover but only 14% of its net profit  the least among awcs three divisions. a back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that the profit margin of the facility division was 3.65%. nevertheless, awc differentiates itself from its competitors  which provide plain vanilla maintenance services  by offering its clients an automated waste collection system through its environment division under the stream brand as well as plumbing and rainwater harvesting systems. these are among the sustainability initiatives that clients look for today, ahmad kabeer points out. awcs environment division  its largest profit generator  is also growing. the stream automated waste collection system is well known and awc has ongoing projects in malaysia, singapore, hong kong and abu dhabi that fill its outstanding order book of rm105 million. ahmad kabeer says a contract to implement the stream system at the cathay pacific catering centre has opened up new opportunities for awc in greater china. in fact, the company is looking to establish a team in hong kong to offer maintenance services under stream and to eventually win more jobs. this bodes well for the company as a whole because its environment arm is highly profitable, enjoying pre-tax margins of 20% to 25%. in malaysia, stream is the market leader with a 90% share. however, automated waste collection systems in the country are still underused, thus making it difficult for the industry to grow. ahmad kabber says his dream is to see the implementation of stream in affordable housing developments in malaysia, similar to what singapores housing development board has mandated in the refurbishment of its developments and in new projects. awc is pitching the idea to the malaysian government, whose economic transformation programme aims to implement an efficient waste collection mechanism. progress has been slow but ahmad kabeer says buy-in from government-linked development companies is promising. meanwhile, the benefits of awcs acquisition of premium plumbing outfit, qudotech sdn bhd, and rainwater harvesting company, dd techniche sdn bhd (ddt), under its engineering division will soon be seen. the two companies not only came with a profit guarantee of rm3.9 million per annum in fy2016 and fy2017 but are also able to secure high-value contracts. the latest example is qudotechs plumbing contracts for kl118 and the malaysia airlines bhd building worth rm62 million and rm19 million respectively. at the same time, ddts prospects are brighter with state regulations that make rainwater harvesting systems mandatory. on may 6, cimb research initiated coverage of awc with an add call. trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 11.67 times, the companys valuation seems compelling. but cimb researchs

airasia bhd\n(june 7, rm2.60)\nmaintain add with an unchanged target price of rm3.13: we hosted airasia bhd on the kuala lumpur leg of its global non-deal roadshow recently. fourteen local institutions sent more than 30 representatives to the well-attended meetings. unfortunately, many malaysian institutions, apart from major funds like the employees provident fund, permodalan nasional bhd and aia bhd, currently have zero or negligible holdings in airasia, having sold off the shares post the gmt research report in mid-2015. subsequently, airasia was pushed off their radar screens, and most are missing the current rally that is being driven by its recovering fundamentals. several local funds brought up the airlines share price volatility in the past year, which had made them wary of an investment in airasia. such sentiments are understandable, as airasia is constantly buffeted by factors beyond its immediate control, which at times, require investors to have total conviction in the long-term story. however, with a substantial improvement in earnings performance in the first quarter of 2016 (1q16), domestic investors may slowly inch their way back into the stock. several local investors were genuinely surprised by how well airasia had been doing on the revenue front, appearing, as it were, to buck the general weakness in consumer sentiment that had been hurting general retail spending in malaysia. airasia explained that this was mainly the result of a downward adjustment in malaysia airlines bhds capacity, malindo airways sdn bhds transfer from klia2 to kuala lumpur international airport main terminal and its transformation into a full-service airline, and possible passenger downtrading. malaysian investors, having seemingly missed the boat, or having got off the ride too early, may have to think hard if they want to commit new funds into airasia at the current price. all the better for the foreign investors who continue to pile into airasia for the many catalysts that are yet to come. for instance, airasia said that demand across the region remains strong in 2q16 and likely into 3q16 as well, benefiting all of its airlines. our own analysis suggests the same. airasia is currently evaluating an offer by a trade buyer to take a majority stake in asia aviation capital ltd (aac), with strong interest among chinese and middle east investors. the best offer on the table so far values aacs equity at us$1 billion (rm4.06 billion), calculated based on the market value of aacs current portfolio of aircraft, as well as imputing some of the value of aacs future portfolio underwritten by airasias large order book with airbus. an initial public offering via dividend-in-specie is possible, but unlikely in our view. without too many details, it is difficult to precisely calculate how the partial sale of aac can flow down to airasias shareholders. but airasia said that it could retain the sales proceeds to pare down its debt, or declare the proceeds as special dividends. both options crystallise the value of airasias in-house leasing business with its own network of carriers, and also the value of its order book with airbus that can be used to grow the business with third-party airlines. whatever minority stake airasia retains in aac can continue to grow in value in the hands of the new owner, which will probably inject fresh funds to buy and leaseback aircraft from non-airasia airlines, and order boeing aircraft for an eventual third-party placement, which will diversify aacs revenue stream from its sole reliance on a320s. although airasias share price has been rerated, we believe there is plenty of upside left; hence, we keep our add call. general risks include resurgence of competition, higher oil prices, and a weaker ringgit-to-us dollar exchange rate.  cimb research, june 7"}, "288": {"date_posted": "8/6/2016", "title": "market still well supported ", "article": "  this article first appeared in the edge

week, but rebounded towards the end to close marginally lower from the previous week. the stocks performances in the first quarter of 2016 were generally weaker than expected. the fbm klci closed marginally lower from the previous week at 1,636.46 points last friday. trading volume remained firm compared to the past few weeks at 1.8 billion shares. however, the average trading value jumped from rm1.8 billion to rm3 billion. nearly rm7 billion was traded last tuesday alone when the index fell. selling pressure continued to come from foreign institutions. net selling from foreign institutions was rm1.2 billion and net buyers were local institutions. local retailers were even. therefore, the support came from local institutions. the ringgit strengthened after a sharp decline in the us dollar last friday, but on a week-to-week basis, the ringgit was firm at rm4.09. in the fbm klci, decliners beat gainers eight to five. the top gainers for the week were sapurakencana petroleum

throughout last week and the price (commodity exchange gold) increased 2.6% to us$1,244.50 (rm5,052.67). crude palm oil on bursa malaysia increased 4.2% in a week to rm2,665 per tonne. if you still remember, last week i mentioned that the market would still be in correction as long as the fbm klci remained in the sideways support and at resistance levels of between 1,610 and 1,640 points. technically, the trend is still bearish below the downtrend line and short-term 30-day moving average. however, momentum indicators like the relative strength index and moving average convergence divergence show that market confidence is getting stronger. the fbm klci is below the ichimoku cloud indicator, but is currently below a thin cloud. this indicates that the fbm klci is set to move into correction after staying sideways for the past one month. furthermore, the bollinger bands have become very narrow, and hence a strong movement is expected if the bottom top band is broken. the market may rebound or continue its bearish trend and this depends at which level the fbm klci breaks. if the index breaks above the resistance level at 1,640 points, then we expect the index to at least test the short- and long-term 30-day and 200-day moving averages at 1,660 points. however, a breakout below the support level at 1,610 points could push the fbm klci lower to the next support at 1,510 points. lets see at which level the fbm klci breaks, but there is a higher chance for the index to rebound as it is now closer to test the resistance level. benny lee is chief market strategist

"weaker ringgit not seen to push inflation higher than expected", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on june 6, 2016.  kuala lumpur: concerns over the drop in the ringgit against the us dollar  reaching as low as 4.176  leading to higher headline inflation this year are exaggerated, according to economists. julia goh, economist at united overseas bank (malaysia) bhd, told the edge financial daily that her projection for the ringgit to close the year around 4.10 to a us dollar has been unchanged since march  when it first flirted below 4.0 against the greenback. goh said direct imports of final goods account for only about 15.9% of the overall consumer price index basket. and citing bank negara malaysias study, the direct impact of exchange rate changes on consumer prices is often not pervasive and limited to selected items. inflation and cost of living are quite separate. the rate of inflation may look low, but what we individually experience in terms of costs of living depends on the basket of goods you consume, which probably differs from the average basket used to compute the cpi (consumer price index), she said. of the more than 500 items that make up the basket, the food and non-alcoholic beverages group has the biggest weightage  at 30.2%, while food away from home is just a third of that. items that had notable price increases last year, however, like cigarettes and liquor, and automobiles or hire purchase payments, have only single-digit weightages, when in fact people tend to spend a considerable percentage of their incomes on them.  inflation for the first four months came in at 3.2%, with february recording the biggest rise of 4.3% before tapering off subsequently, slowing to 2.1% in april. the major contributor to this increase was the alcohol and tobacco group, but the overall rise paled in comparison with the groups 22% jump, given its weightage of a mere 2.9%. goh projects the cpi to grow by 2.8% for the full year  which doesnt stray much from the five-year average increase of 2.44%. but recall that inflation last year was only 2.1% when the ringgit lost over 20% of its value against the greenback, plummeting to as low as 4.457. furthermore, the goods and services tax (gst) was introduced, which forced many business owners to adjust their selling prices upwards. she said currency exchanges effects on inflation tend to have a lag effect. typically, current consumer prices are based on stock bought at the previous rate. hence, if the weakness sustains, it will only affect future prices once the old stock is run down. last year saw exceptional volatility in the ringgit and as a result we did see a number of producers adjust their prices upwards this year such as car manufacturers. however, i dont think the degree of ringgit weakness in recent period warrants another round of adjustment, moreover, the ringgit strengthened in the earlier months this year. if importers hedged correctly, the impact would be less severe, she explained. although the ringgit never recouped all its losses from last year, the local currencys close at 4.145 against the us dollar last friday was still 3.48% higher from dec 31, 2015. nonetheless, mays nikkei manufacturing purchasing managers index, a gauge of national factory activity, indicated that manufacturers continued to cut back on their purchasing activity for the 12th straight month as the weak ringgit meant that imported raw material costs increased. goh said that manufacturers tend to adjust their profit margins instead of prices, which then reduces the sensitivity of consumer prices to exchange rate. but given the resilience in domestic consumption in the first quarter this year, she did not discount the possibility of businesses passing on cost increases to consumers. but it is likely to be selective because in this day and age, i think consumers are more discerning and with greater competition, choices and the use of technology and internet, consumers can sniff out a rotten deal. cimb investment bank bhd director and chief economist for malaysia maslynnawati ahmad seconded gohs view, saying there will be limited opportunity for such a move if businesses want to maintain market share, given the weaker domestic demand anticipated ahead. she projected the ringgit to hover between 4.10 and 4.20 to the us dollar this year, and said that inflation this year will come from base effect factors, domestic fuel prices, and adjustments in prices of administered items. maslynnawati projected the cpi to rise by 3.1%, a rate that she has maintained since april. lower petrol prices last year softened the blow  if any  from the weaker ringgit and gst. recently, crude oil prices managed to trend upwards  with benchmark brent spot rising 34.23% so far this year to us$50.04 (rm204.16) per barrel last thursday  deviating from last years pattern of near-synchronised drop with the ringgit, as concerns over 1malaysia development bhds dollar-denominated bond default saw the ringgit giving back more than half of its gain earlier this year against the dollar. but domestic fuel prices are still slow to adjust as i think the product prices have yet to catch up with the rise in crude oil prices, said maslynnawati. hence, we expect domestic fuel prices would rise, albeit at a gradual pace and that would contribute to the likely faster rise in cpi in the second half of 2016. given that imported petroleum products are priced in dollars, goh said there will be a foreign exchange impact on petrol pump prices as consumers pay in ringgit. consequently, the rebound in oil prices and ringgits recent fall should bring higher petrol prices in theory. what we pay at the pump is affected by global oil prices and ringgit. the fuel component for personal transport carries 7.8% weight in the overall cpi basket. this month, petrol and diesel prices are the same as two months prior, to my relief, she said. regardless, the ringgits weakening should leave some people and businesses fretting, depending on their exposure to foreign currencies. forextime ltd chief market analyst jameel ahmad said the local currency is going to remain under pressure if investors continue to bet on an impending us interest rate rise. economic data showed last tuesday that us consumer spending has climbed to its highest levels in around seven years, which is extremely positive for the united states when you consider consumer spending accounts for the highest proportion of its gdp output at around a reported 70%. he said."}, "290": {"date_posted": "3/6/2016", "title": "s p setia, e&o, mega first, jadi imaging, scomi engineering, cimb, rex industry, hwa tai, tune protect, hap seng

below consensus estimates. they have cut their full-year earnings per share (eps) growth forecasts to as low as 1.8%, with some expecting the figure to fall into negative territory. hong leong investment bank (hlib) research head sia ket ee has revised lower his 2016 eps growth forecast into negative territory of -5.4%, compared to 3.9% previously. this marks the third straight year of contraction. describing the 1q16 reporting season as disappointing, sia said 42% of the stocks under hlib researchs coverage had fallen short of expectations, while a mere 9% surprised on the upside. sia said corporate earnings had been in a recessionary mode despite resilient gross domestic product growth. in the near term, [the] squeeze in margins could still persist given cost pressure[s] such as [rising] wages, energy prices and a weak ringgit, and challenging fiscal position (government squeezing from the private sector), he said in his 1q16 report card yesterday. sia expects a lacklustre june and 3q16 given external uncertainties such as major central bank meetings and the ongoing brexit fears. locally, investors need assurance of earnings certainty before turning positive. however,

estimates are revised marginally lower. nonetheless, we continue to maintain our end-2016 [benchmark] index target of 1,725 points, as analysts have started to roll over their valuation base year to

that investors may consider bottom fishing, as the discount between the fbm klci and consensus target of 5.3% has corrected below its three-year average of 4.7%, indicating lower pricing risk. we

target price (tp) of rm2.40: the nine months of the financial year ended 2016 (9mfy16) revenue and core net profit grew 19.4% and 15.7% year-on-year (y-o-y) respectively. the main drivers were increased orders to commercial markets and favourable operating environment [lower latex prices, stronger us dollar/ringgit rate, especially in the first half of fy16 (1hfy16)]. however, 9mfy16 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation margin declined by a slight 1.9% to 23.4% due to higher operating expenditure from the acquisition of medical latex dua sdn bhd and expanding its own brand manufacturing (obm) segment. the third quarter of fy16 (3qfy16) results were softer quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q)and y-o-y, as we had expected. in line with a revenue drop of 8.7% q-o-q, net profit fell to rm9.6 million (-36% q-o-q). adding back foreign exchange losses of rm5.9 million, core net profit would have been rm15.5 million. however, this was excluded due to karexs export-orientated business. we attribute the weaker earnings to: i) lower average selling prices (asps); ii) less favourable exchange rate; and iii) lower production due to seasonality and lumpy tender orders. we anticipate better earnings performance in 4qfy16 from the ramp-up of capacity added (one billion pieces per annum) in december 2015. we understand that the one billion was not fully capitalised in 3qfy16 as certain production lines were waiting for validation by the thailand government (likely by 4qfy16). we expect utilisation rates to rise from a two-year low of 65.6% to the typical range of 70% to 75%. however, the ringgit has weakened by 5.4% over the march 31 to may 27 period this year. we have assumed us dollar/ringgit rates of 4.10/3.90/3.85 for fy16/fy17/fy18. the group announced the 100% acquisition of pasante healthcare ltd, a united kingdom condom-manufacturing company for u00a36 million (rm35.9 million) last friday. although pasante is expected to contribute minimally to karexs earnings in 1qfy17, we view this acquisition as a good fit as it allows karex to tap into pasantes existing distribution network to expand further into the uk and european markets, particularly in the obm segment. this acquisition did not come as a surprise and we have already factored it into our forecast. post-briefing, we adjust down fy17 to fy18f (forecast) earnings per share slightly by 3.4% to 5.4% to reflect changes in karexs expansion plans, lower asps and acquisition of pasante. hence, we maintain hold, with a lower discounted cash flow-based tp of rm 2.40. although we think the stock is fairly valued, we believe its long-term outlook remains bright, driven by its expanding obm segment and unrivalled position as an original equipment manufacturer. upside risk to our tp is sharp appreciation of the ringgit/us dollar rate and key downside risk is lower condom sales.  cimb research, may 29"}, "294": {"date_posted": "30/5/2016",

administration costs, a lower revenue and weaker property margin. eastern & oriental bhd (e&o) slipped into losses in the fourth quarter of 2016 due mainly to higher admin costs and foreign exchange losses. about rm425 million worth of properties were sold in the quarter, lifting fy16 sales by 12% y-o-y to rm1.1 billion. in a separate announcement, e&o said that its deputy managing director eric chan was resigning, citing expiry of contract and family as the reasons. chan has been overseeing the companys operations for more than a decade and we are negatively surprised by his sudden departure. during the analysts briefing, e&o assured investors that there will be a proper leadership transition as chans replacement, kok tuck cheong, the former chief executive officer and marketing director of aminvestment bank bhd, will join the group before chan officially resigns. chan also gave an assurance that e&o will be in good hands as his replacement will be supported by the existing management team. however, his resignation coincided with a delay in stake sale in seri tanjung pinang 2a (stp2a), a land reclamation project in penang. e&o previously guided that it would secure strategic investors for stp2a by june 2016, but during the analysts briefing it was disclosed that the deadline was probably unachievable. chans departure could exacerbate concerns over a further delay in the stake sale. we still have high hopes that e&o will eventually secure strategic investors for its stp2a project. the strategic investors entry price should set the benchmark for the valuation of the bigger stp2b and 2c projects, which currently accounts for 57% of its total realised net asset value, based on our estimate. however, poor earnings, the unexpected leadership transition and a missed deadline for the stake sale, in our view, could reduce the markets confidence in the stock in the near term. the only silver lining comes from the high unbilled sales of rm1.2 billion as at end-fy16, which should boost e&os earnings in fy17 and fy18. but earnings improvement in fy17 is unlikely to rerate the stock as its fy17 price-earnings ratio (per) of 25 times is the highest among all the developers we cover. while we think the stocks risk reward remains favourable in the long run, management did not commit to a new timeline for the stake sale. the absence of a firm timeline, in our view, is a major hindrance to the stocks rerating. we upgraded e&o to add from hold in february this year as we had anticipated the group to secure strategic investors for stp2a by june 2016. based on the land price of a comparable transaction, stp2 could potentially be worth rm19.5 billion, or almost 10 times e&os market capitalisation. although we had also expected unexciting near-term earnings due to weak economic conditions and the sluggish property market, the potential value of stp2 and the committed timeline for the stake sale made the upside of e&os share price too big to ignore. the key downside risk to our hold recommendation is weaker-than-expected property sales, while the key upside risk is the sooner-than-expected stake sale.  cimb research, may

declined by 42.2% y-o-y to rm18.4 million. this was below expectations, accounting for 19% and 18% of our and consensus full-year estimates. the weaker-than-expected earnings were due to higher overall expenses in the logistics and distribution segment; and higher amortisation charges from its pharmacy information system (phis). accordingly, 1qfy16 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation margin declined by 0.3 percentage points y-o-y to 8.9%. although revenue for the groups logistics division increased 17.6% y-o-y, pre-tax profit (pbt) plunged 92.3%

about 97% of 1qfy16 pbt). the groups 1qfy16 earnings continued to be negatively affected by amortisation charges that rose 83% y-o-y to rm8.4 million, mainly for its phis. to recap, pharmaniaga has spent about rm183 million on phis, which is expected to be amortised across the tenure of its concession agreement that ends in november 2019. we expect the bulk of the amortisation charges to be booked in fy16 to fy17f (forecast). the group declared a four sen dividend per share for 1qfy16. this translates into a 56% payout ratio, which is below our expectations. thus, we have revised our dividend payout ratio forecasts from 85% to 70% for fy16 to fy18f. this leads to lower dividend yields of 3.4% to 4.5%, instead of 5.3% to 6.4%, for fy16 to fy18. given the weaker-than-expected 1qfy16 results, we lower our fy16 to fy18f earnings per share (eps) estimates by 22.3% to 23.4%. this takes into account lower profit margins and increases in operating costs, especially finance costs. as a result, we expect a eps decline in fy16 and an unexciting eps in fy17 to fy18f, on top of amortisation charges for phis. following our eps cuts, we downgrade the stock from hold to reduce. we think

daily, on may 9, 2016.   kuala lumpur: the depressed milk prices may not be good news for farmers but it is a blessing for food and beverages (f&b) companies with products that have milk as the key ingredient. lower milk prices will translate into better margins, and hence better earnings for dairy product manufacturers. according to reports, global dairy prices have fallen around 60% since early 2014, mainly due to weaker demand from china after it stockpiled milk powder. the slower global economic growth has also weighed on the demand for milk. often seen as the darlings of investors seeking defensive investment in a turbulent stock market, bursa malaysia-listed f&b counters have been trending upwards since the beginning of the year. year-to-date, fraser & neave holdings bhd (f&n) has risen 22.6%, dutch lady milk industries bhd is up 13.27% and nestle (m) bhd has gained 2.13%. however, the weak ringgit and soft consumer spending would also mitigate some of the cost savings from the lower milk price as this would mean higher cost of importing the raw material. interestingly, analysts and fund manager are not too concerned about that. kaf investment funds bhd chief investment officer gan kong yik, who closely monitors essential consumer stocks, said the prospects of these stocks remain bright as most of the products they sell are not luxury goods, although consumer spending has slowed down. he said dairy products companies enjoy better margins due to the lower milk prices. the price of milk has declined significantly but there is no change at all in the average selling price, if you notice, he said. gan noted that most of the milk is imported from new zealand. the countrys central bank has cut interest rates in march, triggering a slide in the new zealand dollar. this, in turn, would mean cheaper dairy products from the country. these counters are evergreen and safe. during challenging times, some of the funds will usually have some allocation in these defensive stocks, he noted. as long as they continue to report improving quarterly results, there will be rerating of the stocks, he said, when asked if there is limited upside for these counters. among the three f&b counters, gan preferred dutch lady as it gives better dividends and for the branding it has. dutch lady, which saw its net profit almost double to rm33.89 million in the first quarter ended march 31 (1qfy16) from rm17.03 million a year ago, mainly focuses on dairy products such as milk and yogurt. kenanga research analyst soong wei siang, who covers dutch lady and nestle, said the weakening of the ringgit and the cautious consumer sentiment may not have strong impact on the two companies, looking at their earnings growth. their gross margins are expanding, it shows that they are enjoying better margins, he told the edge financial daily via telephone. as for the weakening of the ringgit, he noted that these companies usually hedge their foreign currency requirements. the current low milk price environment is benefiting them and there is still upside for the current share price, he said, when asked if these counters have already priced in the lower input cost scenario. soong said kenanga has given dutch lady and nestle outperform calls and his target prices for the two counters are rm59.20 and rm82.10 respectively. at this juncture, there is no big issue regarding the supply of milk, but the demand for milk is not strong due to weaker global economic growth. unless there is a strong recovery in global economic growth, the price of milk would not rebound too soon, he added. cimb research analyst kristine wong noticed that milk prices have declined by about 11% year-to-date and 30% year-on-year. she noted that f&n hedges a considerable portion of its us dollars on its committed raw material purchases. thus, we believe that it will continue to reap the benefits of lower milk prices and that margins should remain stable even if the us dollar were to strengthen against the ringgit, she wrote in a note dated may 5. the stock is currently trading at attractive valuations of 18 to 19 times fy16 to fy17 price-earnings ratio (per), which is below its five-year historical mean per of 22 times, and on the back of healthy three-year earnings compound annual growth rate of 18.6%. she maintained an add rating for f&n, with a higher target price of rm26.50. in her note dated may 2, wong said the management of nestle was positively surprised by the lower commodity prices and expects the low price environment to continue until the fourth quarter of 2016, during which it projects the prices of coffee beans and milk powder, particularly, to slowly inch up. she maintained a hold call for nestle, as she believes the company is fairly valued, with an unchanged target price of rm74.94. nestle closed 50 sen or 0.67% higher at rm75 last friday. within the consumer staples sector, wong said she prefers f&n. based on last fridays

performance of the malaysian stock market at the start of this month, which saw its first week skidding to 1,649.36 points, which was 1.4% or 23.36 points lower than the previous weeks 1,672.72 points on april 29.  similarly last year, may was not a good month for the local equities market. it fell 3.89% that month when the ringgit declined against the us dollar, as crude oil prices slumped, and 1malaysia development bhds (1mdb) woes hogged the headlines. but the saying does not always ring true, at least not in the case of the fbm klci. according to bloombergs statistics, the benchmark index gained in may 2011 (+1.52%), may 2012 (+0.64%), may 2013 (+3%) and may 2014 (+0.1%). still, based on the current technical indication, malacca securities sdn bhds technical analyst loui low ley yee thinks the selling may not be done yet this year. this is because the index now is below its 200-day moving average (suggesting a downtrend), which is quite similar with what happened last year, he told the edge financial daily over the phone. however, after the recent selldown that led to the index falling below 1,650 points, he is looking for a mild recovery in the immediate next two weeks, with resistance seen at 1,670 and 1,700 levels. nevertheless, he thinks the market is likely to trend lower in the next two months. he is not the only one. by and large, investment managers are pessimistic about the markets outlook due to lacklustre corporate earnings expectations, as the local currency heads south. first-quarter gross domestic product is also not anticipated to outperform, while the 1mdb default issue hovers over the market like unwelcome haze. on the external side, oil prices, and whether the us federal reserve (fed) will hike interests for the second time since it was last raised in december last year, remain uncertain. as such, negative factors are expected to linger until july. chris eng, the head of research of etiqa insurance & takaful, believes the market will continue to slide and end lower by then, compared with the current level. the index is definitely vulnerable towards the mid-1,500 points, and the technical structure does not look strong without another sharp drop, said james lau, investment director of pheim asset management asia, which manages assets worth over us$250 million (rm1 billion). lau, who described 2016 as a difficult year, also said corporate earnings downgrades are inevitable as key economies remain unresponsive to even negative interest rates. looking for catalysts now is like looking for clear skies through the thick haze that has become a daily feature, he said in an email reply to the edge financial daily. jason lee wei chung, chief investment officer of equity at libra invest bhd, is also of the view that there is no catalyst in sight, and does not consider valuations are cheap yet. currency and oil price movements will be the main drivers for the market in the short term; corporate earnings will be the drivers in the longer term, he said in an email. his views are echoed by kaf investment funds bhd fund manager tan gan leong, who described the market direction as random and volatile in the near term. it will also look closely for cues from the feds federal open market committee meeting in june, he said. but in terms of valuation, he differed: i would say the market as a whole is fairly valued now, considering the current challenging business environment. he also pointed out that if one breaks up the components of the fbm klci, it would be difficult to see strong growth from any particular sector. to him, the financial sector (that is, the banks), which has the largest weightage in the fbm klci, has been very selective with the loans they give out as they are trying to improve their asset quality. meanwhile, he noted that the plantation sector is seeing higher crude palm oil prices being offset by lower production. sell in may and go away is a saying framed by ebullient fund managers in the northern hemisphere as they prepare to head for the greek islands with the beckoning of summer. or should it be make hay while the sun shines? to lau, may is a fertile time, with many rich pickings, especially with prices retracing as they are doing now. so, we are not going away. we are staying, lau said, even as he conceded that catalysts are nowhere in sight. one should look beyond the immediate horizon. i mean, commodity prices have surprised so many on the upside. for example, how many would have anticipated steel or iron prices to rally more than 40% from their lows? short-term recoveries like these are still possible in other sectors or stocks that are currently finding the floor, he said. he also cited stock-specific recoveries like cimb group holdings bhd, tenaga nasional bhd and press metal bhd. in terms of the sector that is worth watching, lau said there is a chance that plantation would break out from its long-holding pattern and surprise on the upside. with the us dollar/ringgit volatility continuing in 2016, he said, there is still some wind left in export-based companies. however, concerning stocks that are bombed out  for instance, certain technology and property stocks  he is selective. lau noted the low export growth and commodity prices are vunerable to the ringgits volatility, causing malaysias trade to not improve much lately. be patient and expect disappointments. dont equate disappointments with failures. sometimes, rewards come later. let time do its wonders, he said. however, eng advised caution. we have no sector and stock pick. we will revisit the market as it falls further, said eng, who downgraded the outlook for the utility and plantation sectors when the market reached its recent high of 1,727.99 points on april 15. meanwhile, lee said malaysia is very much a stock picker market, though he also felt that picking stocks is quite hard at present. sector-wise, he favours construction, services and education. libra invest likes services companies such as scicom (msc) bhd, which is expected to deliver strong earnings growth of over 20% to 30% per annum in the next few years in all their business segments, foreign student visa applications, and business process outsourcing. it said the company also has a strong balance sheet, with a 3.5% dividend yield. as for tan, he remained bullish on consumer staples, with top picks including dutch lady milk industries bhd, ajinomoto (malaysia) bhd and cocoaland holdings bhd. i like them because of their strong pricing power, which is reflected in the high gross margins they enjoy, tan said, adding that the combination of low commodity prices and strong pricing power should continue to drive their earnings. in addition, tan said these companies have strong cash-flow generation ability, and do not require intense capital reinvestment to sustain their earnings. it is also worth noting that these three firms are in a net cash position, he added."}, "302": {"date_posted": "4/5/2016", "title": "cimb niagas provision expenses remain elevated", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on may 4, 2016.  cimb group holdings bhd\nmay 3 (rm4.54)maintain buy with an unchanged target price (tp) of rm5.50: core net profit of pt bank cimb niaga rose by 224.1% year-on-year (y-o-y) in the first quarter of financial year 2016 (1qfy16), underpinned by higher non-interest income, and lower operating expenditure and provisions. it recorded a core net profit of 269 billion rupiah (rm80.2 million) in 1qfy16, which was up by 13% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) and 224.1% y-o-y. the improved earnings were contributed by higher non-interest income (18.5% y-o-y) from an improvement in the treasury business, lower operating expenditure (1.4% y-o-y) and provisions (7.3% y-o-y). its provision expenses remained elevated, but improved on a sequential and y-o-y basis. in 1qfy16, cimb niaga reported lower provisions of 1.34 trillion rupiah, down 3.5% q-o-q and 7.3% y-o-y. cimb niaga remains focused on managing its asset quality, and management is cautiously optimistic about the macroeconomic conditions in the second half of 2016. provisions are likely to remain elevated in 2qfy16, before improving in the second half of fy16. for 1qfy16, loan loss coverage at 116.09% was higher than the preceding quarters 111.53% and that in 1qfy15 of 102.55%. the net interest margin (nim) for 1qfy16 improved to 5.35%, contributed by its higher current account, savings account (casa) ratio of 52.05%. the nim for 1qfy16 rose by 13 basis points (bps) y-o-y to 5.35%, contributed by an improvement in its casa ratio, which continued to rise to 52.05%. its casa growth outpaced the industry with a growth of 13.9% y-o-y against the latters 9.2%. its casa deposits grew by 18.4% and 9.8% y-o-y respectively.  the nim is expected to be under pressure ahead due to its focus on high-quality, low-yielding loans, coupled with bank indonesias policy rate cut by 75bps to 6.75%. cimb niagas loan growth decelerated to 3.1% y-o-y due to the economic slowdown and its strategy to be prudent on asset growth. gross loan growth decelerated to a 3.1% drop y-o-y against a 0.6% growth y-o-y in the preceding quarter. growth in corporate loans continued to decelerate to a fall of 4.1% y-o-y as the group remained focused on rebalancing its corporate loans. its corporate bankings working capital loans grew by 12.2% y-o-y, while investment loans decelerated to a negative growth of 16.6% y-o-y. commercial banking loan growth slowed down further to -6.3% y-o-y. micro, small and medium enterprises (msme) banking loan growth slipped further by 5.8% y-o-y due to the recalibration of its micro business that impacted growth of micro linkage and micro finance loans. gross non-performing loans (npl) in 1qfy16 were 3.9%, versus 4.07% in 1qfy15 and 3.74% in 4qfy15. the rise was contributed by a q-o-q increase in gross npl ratios of corporate (up 10bps to 4.6%), commercial (up 60bps to 6.6%), msme (up 30bps to 3.2%) and consumer loans (up 10bps to 2%). we hold on to our view that the gross impaired loan (gil) ratio is a more forward-looking indicator of asset quality. in 1qfy16, the gil ratio improved to 4.97%, versus 5.03% in the preceding quarter and 5.33% in 1qfy15. the percentage of cimb niaga loans classified under special mention was 10.37% in 1qfy16, versus 8.16% in 4qfy15. the macroeconomic conditions in indonesia remain challenging with uncertainties. nevertheless, the group has already taken conservative provisions, and any recoveries from coal and coal-related loans will be positive for its earnings. we maintain our earnings forecasts for cimb group holdings bhd. although provisions remain elevated, we have not seen further deterioration in provisions for loan impairment. cimb niagas gil ratio has improved y-o-y and sequentially. cost initiatives have taken effect with more efforts to lower operating expenditure in the near future. apart from the mutual separation scheme exercise, the merger of its auto finance business and recalibration of the micro business are expected to yield cost savings ahead. the cost-to-income ratio for cimb niaga has improved to 51.27%, versus 51.63% in 4qfy15 and 54.31% in 1qfy15. we maintain our buy recommendation on cimb group with an unchanged tp of rm5.50, pegging the stock to one times price-to-book multiple of fy17 book value per share.  midf research, may 3"}, "303": {"date_posted": "27/4/2016", "title": "trade wise: can myeg's earnings match its valuations?", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on april 11 - 17, 2016. the justification for the valuations at which myeg services bhd trades rests on the shoulders of the millions of migrant workers  documented and undocumented  in malaysia. the companys shares have come off their peak of rm2.38 seen in april 2015. but, at rm2.10, the counter is still trading at earnings multiples of 50 times  a valuation that several analysts polled by the edge described as on the high side. but, the premium the market accords to the electronic services provider is rooted in the two government contracts it received in the last year and the potential earnings that will flow from them. myeg was appointed to process applications for the renewal of migrant worker permits online starting may 2015. its work includes the compiling and maintaining of a database on the countrys documented and undocumented workers. the company was also picked to process applications for the rehiring of eligible undocumented workers. the new contracts add to the companys already extensive portfolio of government jobs from processing automotive insurance and road tax to the collection of summonses on behalf of local authorities. macquarie research (mer) has a target price of rm2.60 on the stock. in a march 31 note, it estimates that myegs earnings will quadruple by the end of the financial year ending dec 31, 2018 (fy2018), after seeing early indications of what the two migrant worker-related contracts mean for myeg in the companys 1h2016 financial results. it writes, cessation of over-the-counter foreign worker permit renewal services in may 2015 channels transactions to myegs online portal. together with an increase in foreign worker permit quotas under the ongoing illegal foreign worker rehiring programme, mer forecasts myegs foreign worker permit revenue to jump from rm40 million in fy2015 to rm260 million in fy2018. cimb research, meanwhile, calls the nationwide foreign worker permit renewal services an earnings booster for myeg. the house has a higher target price of rm2.83 and a forecast of rm541 million in revenue and rm252.4 million net profit for fy2017.  the bullish sentiment on the stock is not unexpected. compulsory online renewal of migrant worker permits started in may last year and myeg has a monopoly. a march 25 report by uob kay hian research says myeg processes an average of 130,000 applications a month, indicating that the company has successfully helped employers transition to the online platform despite early protests. the number of applications a month is expected to grow to as high as 180,000. myeg charges a transaction fee of rm35 per migrant worker for its online services and is also an agent selling compulsory insurance for these workers. myeg earns average revenue of rm100 for every work permit renewal, analysts say. in just over six months after the implementation, revenue from the renewal of migrant worker permits has grown to contribute half of myegs earnings for the first half of 2016. during the six-month period, revenue more than doubled to rm124.2 million from rm57.5 million while net profit grew 123% to rm58.8 million. so, analysts covering the stock expect the success of the implementation of the migrant worker permit renewal to be replicated in the rehiring scheme for undocumented workers. the rehiring scheme runs from feb 15 to june 30 this year. each registration under the rehiring programme could bring in an average of rm100 for myeg. both mer and cimb research are conservatively expecting that a million out of the estimated five million undocumented workers will be registered during the period. cimb research, in fact, argues that if myeg registers a total of two million workers as the government intends, its fy2016 and fy2017 earnings per share (eps) would rise as much as 18% to 22%. earnings contribution from the rehiring scheme should start showing in myegs third quarter 2016 financials. but, high expectations of the contribution may well be misplaced. while the number of undocumented workers in malaysia appears high, far fewer are eligible to be registered by myeg under the scheme. first, the immigration department has set strict requirements that an undocumented worker and his employer must fulfil. undocumented workers who do not hold valid travel documents, such as a passport, and those who did not enter the country through legitimate means are automatically excluded from the rehiring programme. refugees who are currently working for malaysian employers also do not qualify. in other words, only migrant workers who have overstayed their original work permits will qualify. myeg is one of a few agencies authorised to carry out the front-end registration process for the rehiring programme. specifically, myeg does not process applications for indonesian and myanmar nationals. according to data collected by the world bank, indonesians are malaysias main migrant group at 39%. further, feedback from large employers and industry representatives suggests that businesses find the cost of the rehiring scheme too high and the 6 to 12-month processing period so long that it disrupts existing work schedules. according to myeg, the cost of registration is rm1,134.52, excluding the compound which employers will have to pay to the immigration department for a workers overstaying. even if you are willing to make the payment and wait that long, there is no guarantee that your application will be approved. in the meantime, the migrant worker is not allowed to work. it should be easier, matthew tee, president of the master builders association malaysia tells the edge. the number of applications, tee says, speaks for itself. cimb research reported that myeg processed 13,000 applications in the first month, despite the short duration of the rehiring scheme. questions directed to myeg on the progress of the rehiring programme after february went unanswered. it is also worth noting that myeg bears the cost of repatriating workers who have registered for rehiring but fail to obtain approval from the immigration department. the forecast numbers for the registration for the renewal of migrant worker permits and the rehiring scheme is kind of a toss-up, isnt it? no one knows how many workers will be registered every month and when the number will stop growing. it will take time for these numbers to show, says a local equity analyst. more cautious market observers point out that even if myeg benefits from these migrant worker-related contracts, the sustainability of the companys earnings in the longer term is questionable. danny wong, a fund manager at areca capital, says myeg migrant worker-related contracts are for relatively short periods of time, have no guarantee of renewal and are subject to unpredictable changes in immigration policy. for example, myeg imposed a fee of rm38 for the online renewal of migrants permits when it was first introduced. it was then asked by the government to reduce the fee to rm35. the government eventually agreed to bear the cost of the fee. another instance is the governments decision to impose a temporary but indefinite ban on the entry of migrant workers into malaysia shortly after it signed a government-to-government agreement with bangladesh to bring in 1.5 million bangladeshi workers over three years. also, recall that the malaysia competition commission (mycc) has proposed to impose a financial penalty of rm307,200 on myeg for abusing its dominant position in the provision and management of online migrant worker permit renewal applications. on top of that, there is an additional penalty of rm15,000 for each day myeg fails to comply with remedial actions. the decision is not final and it could take years for the case to conclude. but, cimb estimates that its eps could fall by 21% to 19% if the company complies with myccs remedial actions. from the viewpoint of the stocks current valuation, wong says, for me, the valuation is high at this point. the share price has grown too fast without proof of its earnings resilience. it is not necessarily overvalued, but from a risk angle we dont know if it will deliver the expected earnings. similarly, bimb securities research has a sell rating on the stock due to its high valuations and a target price ex-bonus of rm1.61. as a growth stock, myegs share price performance rarely disappoints. in the last year, its share price has grown 52%. but, now the companys earnings must match its soaring share price.

"}, "305": {"date_posted": "21/4/2016", "title": "cover story: revitalising cimb", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on april 4 - 10, 2016. the dna of cimb group holdings bhd is changing. just in the past year alone, malaysias second largest banking group undertook several cost-cutting initiatives that included major mutual separation schemes (mss) and restructuring exercises in a few markets, costing it nearly rm720 million. it also saw the changing of the guard and reorganised its businesses as well as structure. today, more than 50% of the top guard at cimb group is new. additionally, investment banking, its jewel in the crown, is no longer as big a revenue driver as before. cimb groups consumer banking business is gaining ground. it contributed the most to its profit before tax for the financial year ended dec 31, 2015. it is obvious that the group, which had started off as an investment bank, is no longer as reliant on its investment banking business as before. the increase in contribution from the consumer segment, industry observers say, is also partly due to the headwinds the investment banking environment is facing. so, as the fee income drops owing to fewer deals, the contribution from the other segments such as consumer banking will show an increase. the first year has been very challenging, admits group ceo tengku datuk seri zafrul aziz. when he first took over the post from datuk seri nazir razak, zafrul says, the market was already showing signs that it would slow down.  what we didnt expect was the volatility and the extent of the challenges that we would face, he says. he took over as acting ceo in september 2014 and assumed the role officially in february 2015. in an exclusive interview with the edge, a candid zafrul shares that the journey at the driving seat of the group thus far has been an eye-opening experience. you cant plan for everything. but what is important is the ability to adapt and execute some of the things that we needed to do. in a way, you have seen our results. it is still very much a journey. t18 (target 2018) is towards 2018 but what we wanted to do is to make sure that we hit the milestones for 2015, he says. he adds that cimb group saw a positive jaws ratio in fy2015. a positive jaws ratio shows an entitys income growth rate exceeding its expenses growth rate, measured as a percentage. this is the first time we have managed to get a positive jaws. the last four years were all negative, where cost grew more than income. to change that ratio to a positive 6.9% is a massive step, he says. people were very sceptical about our cost management programme because cimb group is not normally known to cut cost. when cimb group said it would cut cost, nobody believed it ... but weve shown that [we can]. and when people said ... no way the management would do certain things ... weve shown that our guys can adapt to changes. on top of controlling cost last year, zafrul says, the cimb team managed to ensure that the engine was still strong. so, we recorded our highest-ever revenue for the group last year, despite the challenges. people were also worried about our capital, saying that we were a company that was very good at consuming capital but not generating enough returns on capital. weve showed that in the last quarter, our cet-1 (common equity tier-1), from 9.3% in september 2015, went all the way up to 10.3%, because we changed the way we approached capital, he says.  for fy2015, cimb group saw its top line growing 9% year on year to rm15.4 billion. its net profit dropped 8% to rm2.85 billion due to higher provisioning expenses. its return on equity (roe) stood at 7.3%, down from 9.2% in fy2014. cost to income ratio dropped to 55.6% from 59.1% for the same period while total capital ratio improved to 15.8% from 14.7% in the same period. cimb group made rm2.2 billion worth of provisions for fy2015  of which 71.7% came from cimb niaga, 22.7% from cimb thai and 5.6% from cimb bank. zafrul shares that the higher-than-expected provisions were a disappointment. we budgeted for it in indonesia, but we didnt budget for it this large. so, we hope that we learnt from that and this year, we need to make sure we put in place all the right systems and learn from the mistakes, he says (see accompanying story). despite concerns that the asset quality of local loans may deteriorate, he says, the group has yet to see an uptick in provisions here. we are pleasantly surprised. for malaysia, it depends on the economy. but whether this [asset quality remaining intact] is sustainable or not is another question, he says, adding that factors such as the macroeconomic environment and the operating landscape are very volatile. malaysia accounted for 79% of cimb groups profit before tax in fy2015 while indonesia and singapore both contributed 8% each, and thailand, 3%.  cost optimisation, divesting non-core acknowledging that income growth is still one of the top concerns of the industry today, zafrul says the group will continue to focus on optimising cost as well as divesting its non-core assets. i think now is a test for all of us to see how we address these concerns. we were lucky because we started the t18 initiative at the right time, he notes, adding that when markets are tough, one has to make tough decisions. we are looking at selling off non-core  this will free up some capital. last year also was a tough year because the whole restructuring cost was about close to rm718 million, so that eats into capital. and provisions also eat into capital. so, we need to make sure that its a one-off. this year, the restructuring cost wont be that high. aside from its major core banking businesses in southeast asia, cimb group also has a 20% stake in bank of yingkou in china that is parked under its private equity business. banking analysts say given that it is only a 20% stake, the chinese bank is a non-core asset. they also have a stake in the touch n go business, and there is also a view that the private equity business could be a potential non-core asset, says an analyst who covers the stock. the edge wrote in february, citing sources, that the group was in talks with foreign financial institutions to form partnerships for its securities business. the working relationship options it is exploring include selling part of the groups stake in the securities business. it was reported by singapore media recently that cimb group is in talks to sell at least part of its brokerage in singapore to a chinese broking house. just a fortnight ago, cimb group announced that it had signed a conditional pact to sell a 51% stake in pt cimb sun life to its joint-venture partner sun life assurance company for us$42 million. the group is on a mission to get its groove back. in february last year, cimb group outlined its new t18 plans with a target of achieving an roe of 15%, cet-1 ratio of over 11%, a cost income ratio of below 50%, and a 60% consumer banking income contribution by end-2018. industry observers point out that given the tougher operating landscape in the banking industry, banking groups that are stronger in the investment banking segment, such as cimb group, were harder hit as the pipeline for deals dried up and fee-based income fell. this, banking analysts say, could be one of the reasons why cimb group is looking to strengthen its consumer banking division contribution. consumer banking  the bread and butter business of traditional banks  provides a stable income flow. it may not be as sexy as investment banking, but it is a steady and predictable business. the investment banking heydays are over, says one analyst.  at the start of this year, cimb group retrenched 30 staff at its hong kong investment banking and equities operations. in 2015, cimb group cut over 150 jobs, mainly in the investment banking space outside malaysia and indonesia. the majority of them were from the royal bank of scotland, which cimb group bought in 2012. the rm800 million deal (consideration rm431.8 million with an additional rm417.6 million injected as capital) catapulted cimb group into an asia-pacific investment banking player. it had led some to question whether it may have overstretched itself as it led to a significant cost increase at cimb group. last year, cimb group also undertook a mss for its malaysian and indonesian businesses in which a total of 3,614 applications (1,908 from malaysia and 1,706 from indonesia) were approved. the group also saw a changing of the guard. today, more than 50% of its heads are new, including tigor m siahaan as president director of cimb niaga and rafe haneef as ceo of cimb islamic. a number of cimb groups heads, who were viewed as lieutenants of nazir, have left the operations side, giving zafrul space to shape his own team. they include former ceo of corporate banking, treasury and markets datuk lee kok kwan and former group cfo and ceo of group strategy and strategic investments kenny kim. lee and kim are now in advisory roles. lee is also a board member. zafrul shares that forming the team has been a high point for him. its not easy to take over from someone whos done so much for the company, right? ... and leaving it to me to take it to the next level. so, when i asked for advice, everyone kept telling me the most important ingredient is to make sure you have the right people, he says. he believes he has managed to form a good team with the right mix of people  both old and new to cimb group  who are strong in the industry.  stamping his mark when news broke over a year ago that nazir would be passing the ceos baton to zafrul, some people were not convinced that the latter could fill the formers big shoes. fast forward to a year after, and the scepticism seems to be fading away. give him credit for the cost cutting. it takes guts for someone to not be worried about the politics and go ahead ... it was the first major staff rationalisation exercise in the banking industry and it had to be done. revenue was suffering ... banks have no choice, says a director at a foreign financial services company. nazir has loosened his grip on cimb. they do consult him but from what i understand, he does not control the reins as much anymore, he adds. a team head at cimb group, who had worked with nazir and now reports to zafrul, acknowledges that cimb group has morphed quite a bit in recent times. under nazir, cimb was a one-man, one-personality banking group. that has changed under zafrul. some of the changes implemented recently, apart from the reorganising, also included regionalising consumer banking. we are also a balance sheet business now  funding and lending  and not just mainly advising, he says. he may not be as suave an operator as nazir, but he has so far done things that made sense for the group when the winds drastically changed so quickly. the hard decisions that he had made could have been disastrous but so far, i think we can all see that they are starting to pay off, he adds. asked what is it like to have worked for the both of them, he says, both have their own strengths, and also their own peculiarities. please, do not mention my name, he laughs. a managing director of a business unit at rival banking group maybank says zafrul gave room for existing talent to grow when he was ceo of the investment bank there. he played everyone to their respective strengths, which is a skill in its own right. i think its too early to tell whether or not he has made a positive impact at cimb group but to be fair to him, he did join the group at almost its lowest pointu2026 it was not exactly the best of times, says the senior banker, who had worked with zafrul in maybank. investors seem to be taking notice of the stock again. falling to below rm4 earlier this year, touching a six-year low of rm3.85 on jan 21, the stock has risen to close at rm4.77 last friday.  cimb group  notable events 1987 - bank of commerce lists on bursa malaysia. 1991 - bank of commerce merges with united asian bank. in a major restructuring, the

launching the melaka cultural and trade center in zhuhai. it comprises a cultural museum, one-stop tourism centre and exhibition hall to showcase the rich heritage of malaysia. interestingly, uob kay

in the near term and provide a significant boost to its current high yield of 7%. meanwhile, in a report dated march 2, cimb research analyst saw xiao jun estimates that the parcel at zic is worth rm440 million. he says lbs may monetise the land through a sale or partnership with a china-based developer to develop the site. if this materialises, it could trigger another round of special dividends and provide ammunition to lbs for further landbanking activities in malaysia, he adds. uob kay hian has a buy call on the company with a target price of rm1.73, while cimb research has an

frames to a recent april 2016 high of rm1.45. as the share price broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of rm1.26 and rm1.31, look to buy csc steel on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term uptrend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, oscillator and stochastic) have issued clear buy

the share price of conglomerate drb-hicom bhd fell to a 5u00bd-year low of 94 sen on march 9, prompting bargain hunters to sit up and take notice of the counter. after all, its stock valuation appears attractive, with a price-to-book (p/b) ratio of 0.27 times. in other words, it is at a 73% discount to its net tangible assets (nta) per share of rm3.80 as at dec 31 last year. drb-hicoms stock was hit recently following the release of its latest quarterly results that came in below expectations as well as its announcement that it plans to inject kl airport services sdn bhd (klas) into pos malaysia bhd. the plan was not well-received by investors. based on its closing price of rm1.04 last friday, the counter has not only declined 16% year to date but also almost halved from its 52-week high of rm2.03 on march 24 last year. is it time to bottom fish its shares? a senior corporate observer, who keeps track of the conglomerate, tells the edge that after a massive sell-off in the past few months  mainly due to concerns over proton holdings bhd and pos malaysia  the counter is now considered oversold. if you ask me, now is a very good time to accumulate drb-hicom shares because the recent sell-off has resulted in an attractive entry point for the stock, and it has plenty of upside, he says. in a report dated feb 26, rhb research institute head of research alexander chia hock lon says drb-hicom is already at rock bottom. he thinks the downside is limited as the counter is trading at trough valuations and presents a strong case from a risk-reward perspective. drb-hicom owns many profitable businesses and valuable assets but trades at a fraction of its book value, he explains. chia has upgraded the company from neutral to buy, with a target price of rm1.14  applying an undemanding p/b ratio of 0.3 times. drb-hicom, in which tycoon tan sri syed mokhtar albukhary has a 55.92% stake, has more than 80 active companies in its stable. they are involved in the automotive, logistics, financial service, property and construction sectors. last december, the group had proposed to dispose of klas  its logistics operation  and a parcel of land to pos malaysia for over rm800 million. in return, it would be issued with new shares in pos malaysia at rm3.33 apiece, which is expected to raise drb-hicoms holding in pos malaysia from 32.2% to at least 54%. the proposal did not go down well with the market as seen in pos malaysias share price, which has been heading south since the announcement of the plan. this subsequently impacted drb-hicoms share price. it is worth noting that mmc corp bhd, another of syed mokhtars flagship companies, also has a p/b ratio of less than one  0.7 times. in comparison, sime darby bhd and umw holdings bhd are currently trading at relatively higher p/b ratios of 1.6 times and 1.26 times respectively. meanwhile, tycoon-owned diversified groups such as ytl corp bhd, genting bhd and ppb group bhd are fairly valued, with p/b ratios of 1.2 times, 1.08 times and 0.99 times respectively.  proton continues to drag down drb-hicom hlib research analyst daniel wong says drb-hicoms shares are very undervalued at the moment. yes, their valuations are undemanding. it could be the right time to buy drb-hicoms shares as a long-term investment, but it is difficult to say whether the stock has hit rock bottom or not, he tells the edge. wong says it all depends on investors holding power  whether they can afford to hold on to drb-hicom while waiting for national car maker proton to turn around. at the end of the day, proton is the largest slice of the pie in drb-hicom. if it continues to make losses, it will drag down the whole group, he comments. to recap, drb-hicom bought khazanah nasional bhds 42.7% stake in proton for rm1.29 billion in 2012, before it launched a general offer for the then public-listed automaker. in the nine months ended dec 31, 2015 (9mfy2016), drb-hicoms revenue has declined 9% year on year to rm9.54 billion, mainly due to a lower contribution from its automotive segment. proton continued to disappoint with negative sales growth of 10%, bringing its total sale units to 74,000 in 9mfy2016. impacted by the losses at its automotive division, drb-hicom registered a net loss of rm201.14 million in 9mfy2016 compared with a net profit of rm210.39 million a year ago. proton accounted for 70% to 80% of the auto segments losses. an equity analyst for a local bank-backed research house says drb-hicoms overall performance was dragged down by proton and hence, the automaker continues to be the major concern of investors. since drb-hicom acquired proton, the automotive unit has been dragging down the group. the thing is, most people, including myself, are still not convinced that proton will improve anytime soon, he says. hlib researchs wong opines that if drb-hicom continues to make losses, its nta may shrink in the coming quarters. by then, its stock valuation may look less attractive. in his march 15 report, wong highlights that the downside risks of drb-hicom include the slow integration of proton and pos malaysia, a global automotive supply chain disruption, and the slowdown of the local economy affecting car sales. hlib research maintains its hold recommendation on the counter, with an unchanged target price of rm1.05. although automotive sales are expected to remain weak, public invest researchs nur farah syifaa mohamad fuad likes drb-hicom for the lucrative value of the assets embedded in the group, which can be unlocked and monetised when the opportunity arises. for instance, drb-hicom had sold its 90% stake in the six-storey the verge shopping mall, formerly known as tekka mall, in singapore for s$285.3 million. the disposal translated into net sale proceeds of s$189.07 million, which the company plans to use for working capital. public invest research maintains an outperform call on drb-hicom with a relatively high target price of rm1.39. in contrast, cimb research analyst azman hussin is discouraged by the continued operating losses at drb-hicoms auto division, which he believes is mainly attributable to the continued losses at proton. we downgrade our call [on drb-hicom] to hold due to its limited upside potential. we prefer berjaya auto [bhd] for exposure to malaysian autos, he says. the kenanga research team, which maintains its underperform rating on drb-hicom, had on feb 26 downgraded its target price from rm1.06 to 80 sen  the lowest among the six research houses that cover the stock (see table). due to the erratic quarterly earnings, we are applying a 35% discount to its sum-of-parts valuations, the research firm explains."}, "318": {"date_posted": "13/4/2016", "title": "march palm oil stock level 5% ahead of estimates",

"article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on march 28 - april 3, 2016.  in under two weeks, felda global ventures holdings bhds (fgv) deadline to satisfy the conditions precedent for its rm976.3 million acquisition of a 55% stake in china-based zhong ling nutri-oil holdings ltd will end. the ministry of finance has given its blessing for the deal to proceed, but fgv still has to convince bank negara malaysia and its own shareholders by april 8. according to fgvs announcement to bursa malaysia, the central bank has not replied to its application for the acquisition, which was submitted in april last year. shareholders, too, have yet to receive any circulars seeking consent to the acquisition. nevertheless, it is worth noting that the april 8 deadline is a soft one and may be mutually extended by the parties to the proposed acquisition. prior to this, it had been extended from march 4 to march 18. so far, the finer details of the zhong ling acquisition are sketchy and shareholders are unlikely to overlook the gaps in what has been announced. zhong ling is a cayman island- incorporated company with subsidiaries in the refining and production of peanut and other vegetable oils. it has 135,000 tonnes of refining capacity in nantong city in jiangsu province and a 45 million packing capacity. it can boast a customer network of 60,000 retail outlets in five chinese provinces. fgv premised its acquisition of zhong ling on three factors. first, the company impressed with its established operations and proven profit track record. second, fgv intends to boost its downstream capabilities in line with its global strategic blueprint. third, fgv is looking to use zhong ling to penetrate the chinese market. this reasoning, though, may be problematic. based on zhong lings audited accounts, the company generated rm144 million in profit on the back of revenue of rm1.2 billion in fy2013. this translates into a price-earnings ratio (per) of 12.3 times and price-to-book value of three times. there are no audited accounts for fy2014 and fy2015, but zhong ling is expected to rake in a net profit of rm199 million and rm201 million respectively, translating into a per of 10 times for fy2014 and nine times for fy2015. analysts polled by the edge say the acquisition is attractive in terms of its valuations, but they caution shareholders not to jump to conclusions without the benefit of salient details of zhong lings financials, operating statistics, assets and governance issues. the question is, if you can buy a profitable company at such low valuations, why isnt someone else in on it? with the available numbers, what we can infer is that zhong ling has impressive double-digit margins, compared with the industrys single digit. what we dont know is where the earnings are coming from, whether there were one-off items that bumped them up and whether or not they are sustainable. on the face of it, it can be earnings accretive, but you cant say if it is a good or a bad deal at this point, says an analyst. others question whether the structure of the deal enhances shareholder value. under the sales and purchase agreement, fgv will be entitled to more zhong ling shares if zhong ling underperforms in fy2014 and fy2015. the management of zhong ling is slated to issue shares to make up the shortfall. why would fgv want to have more shares of an underperforming company? wouldnt it better if it is compensated with cash instead? the analyst asks. fgv calls the purchase of the zhong ling stake a strategic move because it will protect the companys margins by establishing a strong downstream presence in china. however, the extent to which fgv can derive synergistic benefits from the acquisition is questionable. another analyst from a bank-backed research house questions the rationale and asks, why not buy a palm oil refiner instead? cimb research, which is negative on the acquisition, points out in a feb 26 note that there are a lack of synergies from the assets to be acquired with fgvs existing business because the feedstock required by zhong lings subsidiaries includes peanut oil, not purely palm oil.  even if the deal is mutually beneficial to the negotiating parties, maybank ib research highlights in its feb 29 report that integration and synergy will take time. many are also suspicious of fgvs decision to buy the zhong ling stake, given its track record of overseas downstream ventures. fgv just sold its oilseed processing plant in canada for rm567.1 million in november last year, after three loss-making years. further, while there is appeal in the size and potential of the chinese market, it will not be easy for fgv to grow its presence through zhong ling. market observers say the chinese market is a volume game, with the biggest market share holders controlling the edible oil scene. wilmar international ltd, chinas leading cooking oil producer, had 34% share of the market in 2013. in contrast, zhong lings notable brands, which include tuoniao, youerlang and chuayi, are relatively trivial, at 0.9%. while fgv can muscle in and build these brands to eventually command a bigger share of the market, a slowing chinese economy and more subdued domestic demand can hinder that progress. i believe buying zhong ling can be a good deal if fgv wants to enter a new market. but, everything boils down to future earnings and, at the moment, the buying interest in china is not that strong. so, we will have to see how this goes, says chong hoe leong, an analyst with publicinvest research. investors are likely to get more clarity on the questions surrounding the acquisition when fgv finally calls for a shareholders meeting. in the meantime, the red flags are waving. fgvs stock, meanwhile, has been lacklustre since the announcement of the proposed zhong ling acquisition. fgv ended trading at rm1.48 last friday, 5.7% down from the time the proposed acquisition was first announced last month.

to answer that question, first we must look at what has been driving the sectors valuation down  return on equity (roe). as shown in chart 2, the sectors valuation is largely driven by roe, which has indeed been on a downtrend since reaching its peak in 2010. increased capital requirements and compliance costs have resulted in a lower roe for most malaysian banks, which traditionally have high roes. over the past four years, total equity has increased an outsized 78% while net profit has increased just 2%, pushing roe down from 16% in 2012 to 11% in 2015.  enlarged equity bases arising from capital-raising exercises aside, another reason for the falling roe is the slowing earnings growth momentum  net profit growth slowed from 29% in 2012 to 0.5% in 2014 and a contraction of 4.5% last year. earnings, the numerator in the roe ratio, is generally driven by four factors. the first two are loan growth rate and net interest margin (nim), which are by and large determined by the external macroeconomic environment and capital markets. on the other hand, banks typically have more control over the other two factors, that is, cost-to-income ratio (cir) and gross impaired loans (gil) ratio. aggregate loan growth for banks grew a respectable 10.3% in 2015, albeit somewhat helped by foreign exchange translation, from 11.5% a year ago (see chart 3). as expected, nim continued to compress to 2.6% in 2015 as deposit competition remained intense amid tighter liquidity conditions. meanwhile, cost-to-income ratios have been on the rise since 2012 (see chart 4) on negative jaws ratio (that is, expense growth of 16.8% outstripped income growth of 12.1% in the four-year period). in 2015, this ratio surged to an all-time high of 51.2% due to staff rationalisation exercises carried out by three banks. positively, asset quality is still holding up well with a healthy gil of 1.8% in 2015. that said, given its highly leveraged business model, a seemingly small increase in non-performing assets could hurt its profit and loss statement and balance sheet should the macroeconomic conditions deteriorate.  a return of higher roe in 2016? if roe is the single best indicator of the performance of bank shares, the questions are, did the sectors roe bottom out in 2015 and will it see a rebound in 2016? bank managements generally say that 2016 will be a challenging year, while most research houses are adopting a cautious wait and see stance on the sector. despite the cheap valuations, the key concern is asset quality  arguably the most important indicator to watch and possibly the key share price driver in the late stages of the credit cycle. for local banks, the vulnerable sectors that are at risk include steel, oil and gas (o&g) and commodities. notably, just-concluded 2015 results show huge losses incurred by the o&g sector, particularly the upstream segments such as exploration and production (e&p), shipbuilding and chartering and support services. that said, according to bank negaras financial stability and payment systems report 2015, total bank credit exposure to the o&g industry accounted for a manageable 2.2% of total credit exposure. however, alliancedbs research points out in a march 1 note that ammb holdings bhd has the highest o&g exposure at less than 5%, followed by cimb group holdings bhd (3%), rhb capital bhd (3%) and malayan banking bhd (2.8%) while public bank bhd, hong leong bank bhd and alliance financial group bhd have the least exposure (less than 1%). the research house also conservatively assumes that credit cost will remain high at cimb due to its indonesian operations. however, it expects credit costs to ease in 2h2016. nonetheless, not everyone thinks all is doom and gloom for the banking sector. affin hwang capital and cimb research opine that the sector is poised for a recovery this year, driven by a narrower increase in loan loss provisioning and a decline in operating expenses stemming from staff separation and related restructuring exercises carried out by three banks last year. nevertheless, alliancedbs research is of the view that earnings improvement in 2016, a result of kitchen sinking activities last year, will just be cosmetic and should not warrant too much excitement as there are no visible signs of improvement in the fundamentals of the malaysian banking sector.  which bank to bank on? while the industry indicators do not appear to be overwhelmingly encouraging, there are perhaps banks with particular industry positions and company-specific competitive advantages that might continue to do well even in bad times. alliancedbs research segregates the banks into three groups: (1) resilient banks with no capital-raising or asset quality issues and strong business drivers (public bank and hong leong bank are top picks); (2) banks that have raised capital, have moderate asset quality indicators and are looking to re-energise business growth (rhb capital, with maybank and cimb at the borderline); and (3) banks that may face capital-raising risks, have asset quality problems or struggle to find a business direction (affin holdings bhd and ammb). a popular choice of the analyst fraternity is public bank  one of the best credit underwriters in the region with a defensive low-risk loan book. the countrys third largest bank by assets delivered a respectable roe of 18.8% and year-on-year increase of 12% in net profit in 2015, aided by loan loss recoveries (see columns 3 and 4 of table 1). furthermore, its cost-to-income of 32.6% and gross impaired loans ratio of 0.5% remain way below the industry average, thanks to its strong cost efficiency profile and credit underwriting culture. another popular pick is maybank owing to its size and ability to attract deposits, well-diversified business portfolio with extensive regional exposure in asean (15.8% pre-tax profit from singapore, followed by 3.7% from indonesia) as well as its attractive 6% yield. nonetheless, the diversified portfolio also translates into volatile revenues, owing to currency rate movements and insurance operations. additionally, management also guided for higher impaired loans in 2016. for investors seeking deep value, a quick glance (see column 2 of table 1) reveals that rhbcap is the cheapest among the mid-sized banks with its share price trading 21% below its book value. although its roe is at the lower end among its peers (see column 3), its recent rationalisation exercise should boost its bottom line by up to rm200 million this year. in addition, management targets to complete the corporate restructuring exercise by transferring the listing status to rhb bank by 2q2016, which could be a rerating catalyst. as to what banks to avoid, analysts top choices are ammb and affin. ammb is the worst performing bank stock, which saw its share price plummet 27.7% in the past one year (see column 5). despite its 5% discount to book value and a decent 4% yield, ammb is weighed down by compliance weaknesses, ongoing nim compression and low current account, savings account (casa) base, analysts say. affin, the smallest banking group by market value, is the worst performing bank in terms of financial metrics. the bank has the lowest roe of 4.8% and the highest cost-to-income of 61.7%, owing in part to transaction and integration costs incurred to acquire hwangdbs business. in 2015, net profit plunged 37.7% from a year before while the share price declined 19.6%  the third steepest after ammb and cimb. unless its earnings growth gains traction, the huge 50% discount is probably reflective of its single-digit roe and potential capital-raising risks, which will in turn lower roe. apart from roe, what is perhaps the quickest way to boost valuations is the presence of suitors who are willing to pay at least 1.5 times book value. at a time when banks are rationalising to emerge stronger, some may well be just ripe for the picking.

lumpur: airasia bhd shares edged up to a nine-month high yesterday on news of a proposed rm1.01 billion injection by its two founders  tan sri tony fernandes and datuk kamarudin meranun. the stock rose 5.46% or 10 sen to close at the days high of rm1.93, with 62.57 million shares changing hands, making it the second-most actively traded counter on bursa malaysia. its market capitalisation stood at rm5.23 billion. however, analysts tracking the stock said while the subscription price of rm1.84 is fair, the proposed share issue may not sit well with its minority shareholders as it would result in a 15.3% dilution in its earnings per share (eps). in a note to clients yesterday, cimb research said from a quantitative perspective, the higher share base will dilute eps. investors typically dislike dilution. some investors may wonder why airasia needs to raise equity now when operating cashflows are strong as a result of low oil prices and the stable competitive environment, it said. last friday, airasia announced a proposed placement of 559 million new shares to fernandes and kamarudin at rm1.84 apiece to potentially raise rm1.01 billion, which will increase its share base by 20% once completed by the third quarter of 2016. the exercise is subject to shareholder approval. maybank investment bank research (maybank ib) opined that when founding shareholders inject new capital into a business, it is often when the business is in distress or debt financing is no longer attainable. however, it noted that in airasias case, the low-cost carrier is far from distress and is instead on track to deliver strong earnings growth in 2016. while the capital injection will benefit the group, it is not critical as airasia had a manageable net gearing of 2.29 times as at the end of 2015. furthermore, minority shareholders will lose out as their shareholdings will be diluted, and some might not be happy that they are not given the option to participate, said maybank ib in a note yesterday. midf research stated that while the placement would cause an unwelcome dilution of 15.3% in eps to existing shareholders, what they would actually be getting in return is a reduction in debt by rm342 million, which reduces financing costs by rm10.7 million. higher equity and lower debt reduce net gearing from 2.29 times to 1.8 times, and another point to note is 65.5% of the proceeds are to fund the airlines expansion, said the research firm. cimb research said investors should take note of the two qualitative aspects that standout in the proposal. firstly, the founders are willing to put in additional cash at the existing undiscounted share price, which suggests that they believe airasia is worth much more. secondly, they will raise their stake from 18.9% to 32.4%, meaning that they will have even greater commitment and incentive to make it work, it added. cimb research believes that investors will ultimately take their cue from the positive qualitative aspects of the placement exercise and so, near-term pressure on the share price should be eventually absorbed. the issue price represents a 0.6% premium to the airlines closing price last thursday of rm1.83 and a 31.4% premium to the 12-month volume-weighted average price of rm1.41 per share. post the proposed share issuance, fernandes and kamarudin will hold a 32.5% stake in airasia, just slightly under the 33% threshold to make a mandatory general offer to the airlines minority shareholders."}, "324": {"date_posted": "4/4/2016", "title": "uchi technologies riding on europeans love for coffee",

is banking on europeans love affair with coffee to improve its profitability. the group currently derives its earnings entirely from the european market, of which analysts like affin hwang capital research has expressed concern over uchi technologies over-reliance on a single market in generating income, noting that demand for high-end automatic coffee machines has slowed in the past few years, in tandem with the sluggish economy in that region. however, uchi technologies executive director edward kao te-pei is unfazed by the challenges, saying the group has no intention of changing its market focus. the nature of our current product line and its application are towards the high-end market, where the main players are from europe, he told the edge financial daily in an interview at the groups headquarters in penang. as a designer, we do not want to end up competing with chinese players that will compromise our profit margins (due to intense competition). as such, the lower-end market is not the market that we are aiming for. going forward, we will still focus on the high-end consumer appliance market, which mainly originates from europe, he said. according to the sept 19, 2013 findings from global research firm gfk, more than 18 million coffee machines are sold in europe every year. nevertheless, kao is cognisant that the european market has slowed down since 2002, which prompted many european firms to cut down their advertising and promotion, as well as research and development (r&d) expenditure. [however,] in recent meetings, our clients have indicated to us that the economic situation [in europe] is improving and they may consider increasing their orders again, he said. we dont know whether this is going to translate into actual orders. we have to wait until june when the ordering process [for the period of june 2016 to june 2017] takes place, he added. in view of rising demand, uchi technologies said it will be building a bigger r&d team to enhance its capability. currently, we have over 40 r&d personnel. we will increase our headcount at various stages in order not to burden our cash flow, said kao. in a note to clients on feb 25, affin hwang capital research said it remains cautiously optimistic about uchi technologies in view of sluggish revenue growth. so long as the bulk of sales head to the european markets, a region where the economies have remained relatively frail, the replacement cycle for consumer discretionary products such as high-end automatic coffee machines will likely remain lethargic, the research firm noted. affin hwang capital research has upgraded the stock to a buy after the recent pullback in its share price, with an unchanged target price (tp) of rm1.90. for cimb research, it sees limited upside to uchi technologies stock from the current level, given the sluggish industry demand outlook. however, the groups financial position remains strong, with net cash of rm174 million as of december 2015. hence, we see ample room for the group to increase dividends. the stock offers attractive dividend yields of 7.1% and 7.4% for the financial years ending dec 31, 2016 and 2017 (fy16 and fy17) respectively, it said, maintaining a hold call with a tp of rm1.71. to sustain earnings growth, kao said the group actively participates in international exhibitions every year to exhibit its capability. meanwhile, uchi technologies expects revenue to remain flat in fy16 due to the volatile economic environment. despite this, we shall endeavour to maintain the average five-year profit margin of 40% this year, said kao. he also said uchi technologies is in the process of developing a new electronic control module for coffee machines with a mid-range price tag. in addition, it is developing new products for use in the laboratory and biotech equipment segment, which will create new income streams for the group this year. uchi technologies has two manufacturing plants located in prai, penang, and dongguan, china, with an average utilisation rate of 80%. we have allocated about rm5 million in capital expenditure for fy16 and fy17. this includes r&d expenses for coming up with new products, kao added. in the fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2015 (4qfy15), its net profit surged 71.2% to rm15.84 million, a seven-year high, from rm9.23 million a year ago, mainly underpinned by a strong us dollar rather than volume expansion. revenue grew 24.4% to rm30.4 million from rm24.43 million in 4qfy14. for the full year (fy15), it posted a 23% jump in net profit to rm49.3 million from rm40.11 million, while revenue was at rm112.61 million, an 18% increase from fy14s rm95.43 million. year to date, uchi technologies share price has fallen by seven sen or 4% from rm1.74 on dec 31, 2015. the stock closed unchanged at rm1.67 last friday, bringing a market capitalisation of rm660.47 million."}, "325": {"date_posted": "4/4/2016", "title": "cimb to sell non-core assets -

negara malaysia, valued the stake at a price-to-book (pb) multiple of between 1.45 and 1.6 times, sources say. daiwa is aiming for a 25% to 30% stake in affin hwang ib and valuing it at a healthy pb multiple of between 1.45 and 1.6 times. if all goes well, the new shareholder should be in by the middle of this year, a source familiar with the matter tells the edge. the valuation represents a significant premium to the pb multiple of 1.28 times that affin holdings bhd was subject to when it acquired hwangdbs investment bank, which now forms part of affin hwang ib, back in 2014. it is also a premium over the average pb multiple of 1.3 times for mergers and acquisitions (m&a) in the malaysian investment banking space since 2000. if approved by the central bank, the transaction would be a coup for affin hwang ib, considering that it is being done amid a more challenging economic backdrop. deals done in a downwards cycle are typically done at a discount, rather than a premium, to the average, notes an industry observer. affin hwang ib is the investment banking arm of affin holdings, the countrys second smallest banking group. that daiwa is willing to pay a decent premium for a minority stake in affin hwang ib could indicate that it has larger plans for the investment bank. with a 25% to 30% stake, it is likely that daiwa will have some oversight in the running of affin hwang ib, which could include board representation. according to sources, one of the terms of the proposed deal is that affin hwang ib will have the option to partner daiwa should the japanese investor make any acquisition moves in asean. this is significant for affin hwang ib as it could pave the way for its expansion into the region. while most of its larger peers, such as cimb investment bank and rhb investment bank, already have a presence in asean, affin hwang ib has yet to venture abroad. it has, instead, business alliances with foreign partners. in fact, its relationship with daiwa  japans second largest brokerage after nomura securities  started off that way. the two forged a business alliance in december 2013, sharing equity research reports with each others clients and facilitating equity trades. daiwa, in its bid to generate more income from abroad, has been looking to expand in asia through acquisitions. at present, its only equity investment in an asean brokerage is vietnam-listed saigon securities inc, in which it has a 10% stake. it plans to boost its stake in vietnams largest brokerage to 15% and have a larger say in its management, the nikkei asian review reported last month. as a global franchise, however, the daiwa group has a presence in most key markets, which is one of the main reasons affin hwang ib is said to be keen to have daiwa as its shareholder  to leverage the latters regional connectivity. in asia, daiwa has offices in singapore, hong kong, south korea, taiwan, india and the philippines, among others. its been tough for affin hwang ib to compete with the big investment banks at home that have strong regional presence, an industry observer remarks. meanwhile, industry sources wonder whether daiwas potential entry into affin hwang ib would upset another japanese investor. nikko asset management asia  a subsidiary of japans nikko asset management co ltd  holds a 30% stake in the groups asset management business, affin hwang asset management bhd. it has been a shareholder for close to five years now. it will be interesting to see how nikko reacts to another japanese investor coming in at the parent company level. nikko and daiwa are fierce rivals in japan, a source says. on april 29 last year, bank negara allowed daiwa to commence talks on acquiring a minority stake in affin hwang ib, with the condition that the parties conclude their negotiations within six months. they were unable to do so within the stipulated period, but managed to to get a four-month extension from the central bank. on feb 29, the date of the extended deadline, affin holdings announced in a stock exchange filing that an application had been made for bank negara to approve the proposal. industry players say the central bank typically takes a month or so to approve deals involving minority stakes. if so, it may be the last m&a deal to be approved by governor tan sri zeti akhtar aziz before she retires on april 30, after 16 years at the helm. apart from asset management, affin hwang ib operates three other businesses  investment banking, securities and treasury. in fy2015, it reported a lower profit before tax (pbt) of rm59.8 million compared with rm88.9 million in the previous year, mainly due to an increase in overhead expenses of rm53.9 million, which included rm16.9 million from a staff rationalisation

every cloud has a silver lining  value is emerging from regional equities and bonds for long-term investors. impact of low oil prices to last low crude oil prices have had a negative effect  a revised budget 2016 at home and capital expenditure cuts in many countries. oil-producing nations have been urged to stop pumping at record levels to bolster crude oil prices, but many of these countries are unwilling to do so. by doing so, they could lose market share, which may be hard to win back. if we look at crude oil prices over the last 20 years, they have gone up and down several times. when the price was around us$130 per barrel, everyone seemed bullish and pundits even predicted that it would rise to us$200 a barrel, which never happened. likewise, the price is at the lower end of the band now and everyone seems bearish and pundits are suggesting it can go even lower, says pmb investment bhd ceo ameer ali mohamed. with the current development, it is a matter of time before crude oil prices recover. this, in turn, will help the ringgit recover. any significant change in crude oil prices and the ringgit will definitely have an impact on most of the listed companies. therefore, we will need to restrategise based on the latest variables. pheims tan says it is unlikely that the current oil price rally will be sustained over the short term, given the difficulty in reaching an effective and binding consensus among producers. oil prices of between us$30 and us$40 per barrel would be good for the global economy. we prefer to remain conservative and look for gems in the current circumstances. on the domestic front, following the significant outflow of foreign funds in 2015, any recovery in oil prices or upside to the ringgit may attract an inflow of foreign funds, which will help underpin the local stock market. government-linked funds, which are reducing their foreign investments in favour of domestic equities, will help provide buying support for stocks on bursa malaysia.  asia ex-japan still the fastest growing region despite the record outflow from emerging markets last year following the increase in us interest rates, asia is still among the fastest growing economies in the world, says ken goh, cimb-principal asset managements acting chief investment officer for asean. with about a third of the worlds population, asias consumer spending base will develop at an accelerated rate. although chinas annual gross domestic product (gdp) growth is expected to stabilise at about 5%, its gdp is still expected to reach us$15.4 trillion in the next four years. more importantly, in asia, we do not foresee a sharp deterioration in employment, investment spending, inflation or consumer spending within the countries our funds invest in, he adds. but the firm is not sanguine that oil prices will improve this year as oversupply is likely to persist, says goh. although we still believe there is downside risk to the ringgit, we do not foresee the same drop in magnitude we saw last year as a lot of negative sentiment has been priced in. amfunds management bhd (aminvest) chief investment officer for equities andrew wong says growth is expected from asean, with indonesia and the philippines in the lead. the macro picture is currently clearer with regard to asean. we see an opportunity in the technology sector, especially once more clarity surfaces and when we see limited downside, he adds. market conditions, such as volatility, continuous earnings downgrades and slowing growth, would affect all strategies. in order to limit downside risks, we will focus on dividend yielders, countries with better fiscal and monetary policies, and non-discretionary sectors such as medical tourism. wong advises avoiding the banking and technology sectors as a result of the rising cost of credit and softening demand in the internet of things sector. cimbs goh remains slightly guarded about malaysias economic growth rate and the governments commitment to fiscal rationalisation. we stay cautious on malaysian funds with the portfolios defensively positioned. we think the current strength in the ringgit is not sustainable. hence, we continue to like exporters, but will rotate into lower price-earnings ratios and [companies] with high growth [potential]. we like construction companies for infrastructure plays, he says. the ringgit fell to a 17-year low in august last year, below the psychological level of 4.00 against the us dollar. aminvest chief investment officer for fixed income goh wee peng says there may be further cuts in bank negara malaysias statutory reserve requirement or an adjustment in interest rates in the second quarter of the year if growth prospects worsen locally. we will be avoiding sectors that are cyclical in nature and that require high capital expenditure in the coming years, for example, the oil and gas, automotive and technology sectors. she adds that there are pockets of opportunities in various asset classes and in different trading spaces. via active management, we will take advantage of volatility to enhance the returns of the funds. it can be a combination of asset allocation, duration positioning and spread trading. with strong conviction and a disciplined investment process, we are confident of continuing to deliver consistent above average returns.  sectors poised for growth in the light of the uncertainties, asset managers are overweight on sectors that could potentially be resilient such as infrastructure, utilities, telecommunications and consumer staples. public mutuals yeoh says sectors with secular growth trends, such as healthcare and technology, are also something to look out for. companies that are able to increase sales by growing market share or by introducing new products, as well as sectors that benefit from ongoing changes in lifestyle and demographic trends are anticipated to perform well, she adds. however, given the challenging economic circumstances, yeoh advises caution when buying into companies that are highly geared or have poor operating cash flow. with the uncertainty in foreign currency movements, we are cautious on companies that have a high proportion of operating expenses or borrowings denominated in foreign currencies, she says, adding that public mutuals strategy is to focus on markets and companies with strong fundamentals. despite the headwinds in the market, she advises investors to continue investing on a regular basis as market down cycles offer potentially good investment opportunities for long-term investors. investors are advised to maintain a diversified portfolio with allocations to select domestic, regional and global equity funds as well as fixed-income funds. while it is difficult to predict the movement of equities, sheila is positive about high single-digit returns. the fund house has its bets on sectors such as construction, plantation and industrial products. we will continue investing in the manufacturing and consumer sectors, which are expanding capacity and markets, rather than just depending on the benefit of a stronger us dollar against the ringgit. additionally, a weakening against the us dollar could provide a further boost to the plantation sector. ameer recommends that investors have a minimum three-year investment horizon. make sure you know the investment objective, investment strategy and asset allocation strategy of the fund in which you invest. if the fund has a historical performance, make sure you know its geometric annual performance and volatility level. make sure you invest in a fund that suits your risk appetite, he says. if you are in a savings mode, then you should invest periodically, preferably on a monthly basis, in the same fund. do not be afraid to add on to your investment when the market is down. keep yourself updated on the performance of the fund  not on a daily or monthly basis, but on a quarterly basis."}, "333":

chua ma yus emergence as a substantial shareholder in malaysia building society bhd (mbsb) last week, not surprisingly, generated strong interest in the non-bank lenders shares. chua, a billionaire investor known for his savvy stock-market moves, acquired a 3.76% direct stake (or 106.67 million shares) and a 2.3% indirect stake (65.23 million shares) in mbsb on monday, according to a filing to bursa malaysia on wednesday. with that, he now holds 6.05% equity interest in mbsb and is the second largest shareholder after the employees provident fund (epf), which has a controlling 65% stake. the following day, mbsbs share price jumped 6.1% or 8 sen to close at rm1.40 on stronger-than-usual trading volume of 3.79 million shares. the volume was more than twice that of the previous day. the stock edged up a further four sen on friday, closing at rm1.44 on 3.26 million shares. analysts tend to see the stock as a merger and acquisition (m&a) play, given how mbsb has often stated that it plans to become a full-fledged islamic financial institution by merging with a rival islamic lender. given chuas astute stock-market moves in the past, some are wondering if his entry is in anticipation of a potential corporate development at mbsb. it isnt the first time chua has acquired shares in mbsb. in the groups 2013 annual report, the 63-year-olds name was in the list of its 30 largest shareholders via three pledged securities accounts, with a collective interest of 1.61% as at feb 28, 2014. that was about four months before bank negara malaysia gave the green light for mbsb, cimb group holdings bhd and rhb capital bhd to commence discussions on a merger that would create the countrys largest standalone islamic lender. however, the merger was called off in january last year after six months of talks, as economic conditions deteriorated. a few months later, mbsb started merger talks with bank muamalat malaysia bhd. but that too was aborted just last month, as the parties could not agree on a deal. analysts and industry sources say it is unlikely mbsb will attempt another m&a exercise so soon, after two failed attempts over the last 12 months. the stock is one of the most undervalued financial stocks. i suspect he [chua] might have got in because he saw value in it, hoping to ride on any m&a that might come later. mbsbs financial results havent been all that great of late, but thats mainly because of its impairment programme, says an industry source familiar with chuas dealings. another source points out that mbsbs cost-to-income ratio, at 22.7%, is one of the lowest in the industry. its asset quality has improved, with the net impaired loans and financing ratio at 2.81% as at fy2015, a marked reduction from 4.05% a year earlier. president and ceo datuk ahmad zaini othman reiterates that mbsb isnt looking at any merger options at the moment. he says the focus this year is to strengthen the company, so that in the event it decides to embark on a corporate exercise later, it would be in a better position to do so. we get many proposals coming our way, but well take our time, he tells the edge in response to emailed questions. he declines to comment on chuas emergence as a substantial shareholder. mbsb reported a drastic 75% drop in net profit to rm257.59 million in fy2015, mainly because of higher allowances for impairment losses on loans, advances and financing. they came up to a sizeable rm697 million that year. the groups revenue, however, rose to rm3.05 billion from rm2.61 billion before. higher-than-expected impairments led it to suffer a net loss of rm15.81 million in the final quarter  its first quarterly loss in many years. the higher 4q2015 allowance for impairment losses was mainly due to impairment of a legacy corporate account and increase in retail non-performing loans and financing. as disclosed in our results, the impairment for the coming quarters would be related to credit cost for our impairment programme, estimated at 2% per annum, ahmad zaini explains. higher allowances for impairments have been a drag on mbsbs earnings since it embarked on an impairment programme in the fourth quarter of 2014 as part of its initiatives to become more like a bank and be in line with banking standards and best practices. the programme was initially expected to last for two years until fy2016, but mbsb recently reiterated to analysts that it would go on until fy2017. this is due to the adoption of a new methodology coinciding with frs 9 bnm guidelines. thus, management guided that credit costs, which was at 2.1% for fy2015, will remain around 2% for fy2016/fy2017, kenanga research says in a march 1 report on mbsb. as such, analysts have mostly maintained their neutral call on the stock. kenangas target price is rm1.40 while midf researchs is rm1.31. despite the fact that the impairment programme will propel the group further in the long term, it has to continue to bite the bullet for these two years, midf research says in a feb 29 report. chua is no stranger to the corporate world, having co-founded rashid hussain securities and rhb bank. his son-in-law is quek kon sean, the youngest son of hong leong group tycoon tan sri quek leng chan.

appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on february 29 - march 6, 2016  those who have been keeping track of the employees provident funds (epf) earnings in recent years, would know that equities  essentially stock price gains and dividends  have brought in 55% to 60% of its investment income for the past three years, despite the asset class making up only 42% to 44% of its total investment assets. while the epf still keeps just over 50% of its assets in fixed income instruments, including government bonds and other investment grade debt paper, it should be no surprise in the current low yield environment that interest from fixed income instruments only brought in 35% to 40% of its annual investment income from 2013 to 2015. it is worth noting, however, that dividends from local stocks could have contributed up to a quarter of the epfs earnings in 2015, back-of-the-envelope calculations show. can investors also profit from tracking the epf? based on its top 30 domestic equity holdings as at end-2015, it is estimated that dividend income from these stocks came up to between rm1.8 billion and rm3.2 billion  that is easily 15% to 25% of the epfs local equities income for 2015  assuming that local equities accounted for 50% of its equities income, or rm13 billion. the epf acknowledged the contribution from the equities asset class when it declared its record dividend payout of rm38.24 billion for 2015, up 4.3% from rm36.66 billion in 2014 (albeit on a lower 6.4% rate versus 2014s 6.75%, but still above fixed deposit rates and the risk-free rate of below 4%). during the year in review, equities continued to be the main contributor of income with 58.81% amounting to rm26.01 billion, up 13.54% compared with rm22.91 billion in 2014, its feb 20 statement read. the epf went on to say that the foreign equity portfolio played a significant role in 2015 by generating more than 50% of the income from equity investment. the significance of dividend income from investments in local equities to total earnings goes up if foreign equities account for a lot more than 50% of equities income in 2015. the epf reports its top 30 local equity holdings on a quarterly basis but not foreign equities. what is known is that epf ceo datuk shahril ridza ridzuan previously said the epf invests in quality blue-chips overseas, much like its domestic strategy. it is estimated that the epfs foreign assets were worth about rm171.13 billion, given that they make up 25% of the provident funds total investment assets of rm684.53 billion as at end-2015. according to its 2015 earnings briefing slides, 43.4% of the epfs foreign assets are in asia, of which 97% were in equities. a quarter of its foreign assets were in north america, of which 60% were in equities and 39% fixed income. europe accounted for 22.9% of investment assets, of which 64% were in equities. australia has an allocation of 5.2%, of which 29% was in equities and 56% in fixed income instruments. at 25% (rm171 billion) in 2015, the growth in the proportion of foreign assets to local assets has slowed year on year, from 23% (rm146 billion) in 2014. foreign assets accounted for 20% (about rm118 billion) of the epfs total assets in 2013, 17% (about rm90 billion) in 2012 and 13% (about rm61 billion) in 2011. but, just like the equities asset class, the epfs foreign assets accounted for a significantly higher portion of total earnings in 2015  a testament to its structured overseas investment programme, which it said formally started in 2006. overseas income was also higher in ringgit terms with the ringgit sharply lowere last year. despite making up only 25% of total investment size, foreign investments contributed 48% of the epfs total rm44.23 billion investment income in 2015, thus outperforming domestic assets, epf chairman tan sri samsudin osman said in the feb 20 statement. the epf is reportedly looking to increase its foreign assets to 27% over the coming two years to diversify its portfolio. it is worth noting, however, that the epfs foreign assets touched 27% as at end-september 2015. it is not immediately certain why foreign assets reduced from 3q2015 to 4q2015, but the change in the strength of the ringgit could be a factor. to the question of whether the epf faces constraints in diversifying overseas, given putrajayas recent instruction to repatriate foreign investments, the epf ceo reportedly said the government had never stopped the epf from acquiring overseas assets as it understood the need for diversification. another outperformer is the predictable income stream from the alternative investment class, namely the real estate and infrastructure asset class, which contributed rm1.7 billion in investment income in 2015, up 22.2% from 2014. this asset class  which includes foreign investments and was initiated in 2010, which the epf said showed encouraging performance  reportedly accounts for about 4% of total earnings, while making up 3% of total assets. the intent is to have this asset class make up about 8% to 10% of investments over the next three to five years. for investors interested in tracking the epfs equities investments, a quick comparison of its top 30 local stock investments found that it broadly increased its holdings in stocks whose prices ended lower year on year in 2015, except for media prima bhd, sime darby bhd and ijm plantations bhd, in which the provident fund reduced its exposure even as stock prices fell. similarly, the epf pared holdings in stocks whose prices ended higher year on year in 2015, except for public bank bhd, united plantations bhd, ijm corp bhd and dialog group bhd, in which it raised holdings year on year, even as share prices rose. it should be noted that an end-2014 to end-2015 holdings comparison only shows a year-on-year change in portfolio standings and is simplistic as it might not capture a change in buy or sell directions between the 12 months. put another way, the epf and its portfolio managers could have taken profit while share prices moved higher and bought shares again when prices fell. according to stock exchange filings, as at feb 24 this year, the epf was still buying united plantations and dialog while paring its exposure to sime darby and ijm plantations. it is also worth noting that purchases of bimb holdings bhd shares were among the largest year-on-year increases in shareholding by the epf among its top 30 domestic equity holdings. as at end-2015, the epf held 12.6% of bimb, up more than 3% from 9.49% at end-2014. the epfs stake in bimb rose further to 12.99% as at feb 22, stock exchange filings show. the epf also bought tenaga nasional bhd shares, which fell on fears of it overpaying for acquisitions as well as a surprise tax bill. other sizeable year-on-year increases in holdings in 2015 were banking stocks, including malayan banking bhd, where its shareholding went from 13.3% as at end-2014 to 17.06% at end-2015, but this had been reduced to 15.49% at the time of writing. the epf also raised its stake in cimb group holdings bhd from 14.65% as at end-2014 to 17.41% at end-2015 while it currently holds 16.92%. the epfs shareholding in ammb holdings bhd rose from 14.36% as at end-2014 to 16.45% at end-2015 and stood at 15.98% at the time of writing. [see table] meanwhile, a new addition to its top 30 holdings list last year was malakoff corp bhd, which had an initial public offering in may last year. the epf reduced its equity interest from 30% to 17.45% by offering part of its stake for sale. its shareholding was 18.83% as at end-2015 but had fallen to 17.5% at the time of writing. more importantly, 90% of the epfs top 30 investments paid some form of dividend in 2014 and at least 60% are likely to do the same for 2015. in 2014, total dividends from its top 30 holdings are estimated at rm3.2 billion. while the reporting season for 2015 was still ongoing at the time of writing, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that at least rm1.8 billion had been paid to the epf by those that have announced fy2015 dividends  a testament to the importance of yield to bolster ones portfolio.

we understand the premium includes the cost of potential operational delays for the company and shifting costs, which we believe is fair, said the research house in a note. the company intends to

perform with a reduced target price (tp) of rm1.40: after an analysts briefing with the management last friday, we reduced our tp to rm1.40 (previously rm1.53) for malaysia building society bhd (mbsb), but maintained our market perform call. at the briefing, while reviewing its financial year 2015 (fy15) results, the management gave guidance on its loan-loss provisions for the next two financial years and reiterated its aspiration to become an islamic bank.  to recap, mbsb reported a net profit of rm258 million in fy15, a fall of 75%, dragged down by higher impairment allowances amounting to rm697 million. higher impairment allowances have been the bane of mbsbs earnings since it embarked on a collective assessment programme in late 2014. the programme is part of its efforts to adopt banking industry standards, as it strives to become a full-fledged banking entity. recall that the proposed cimb group holdings bhd-rhb capital bhd-mbsb merger was called off last year, which we believed was partly due to the differences in mbsbs provisioning standards. the collective assessment programme was expected to last until the first half of 2016, but the management reiterated that it will instead continue until 2017. this is due to the adoption of a new methodology coinciding with the frs 9 bank negara malaysia (bnm) guidelines. thus the management guided that credit cost, which was at 2.1% for fy15, will remain around 2% for fy16/fy17. we understand that the management expects loan growth of between 5% and 6% for fy16 (fy15: 4.4%) as it strives for higher composition of corporate loans and financing, which currently stands at 15% of total loans and financing. the management also guided that net interest margin (nim) will be under 3% (fy15 nim: 3.4%) as it strives to boost its liquidity funding. despite the failure of two merger talks, the management reiterated that its still aspiring to become an islamic bank, and is still open to corporate exercises that will achieve or accelerate its aspiration and transformation plans. hence, its possible that we may see the group in another merger and acquisition scenario, although we believe this could be unlikely to happen in the short term. the management believes that the rapid adherence of the bnm guidelines will support its claims in future pre-merger talks. with this new guidance, we revised our assumptions for fy16/fy17; our new assumptions for fy16/fy17 are loan growth at 5%/5% (previously at 3%/3%), deposits growth at 6%/6% (previously at 4.5%/4.4%), nims at 3%/3% (previously at 3.2%/3.1) and credit charge at 2% for fy16/fy17 (previously 1.3%). our fy16/fy17 earnings are slashed downward by 63%/57% to rm152 million/rm166 million. we maintain our market perform rating with the tp reduced to

rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,671.82 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,503.68 (low) and 1,727.41 (high). the indexs decline from 1,867.53 (april 2015) to 1,503.68 (august 2015) was

which was also a perfect upward 62% retracement of the 1,867.53 to 1,503.68 move. the indexs next two minor swings comprised a minor low of 1,622.84, which then stalled at the 1,706.25 minor high on dec 30, 2015. its persistent weaker price action in january 2016 was in tandem with the softer tone for global markets and the index troughed at 1,600.92 on jan 21, 2016. the indexs next rebound from the 1,600.92 low surged to a new recent high of 1,699.96 yesterday. the indexs daily signals are all positive, with its commodity channel index (cci), directional movement index (dmi), oscillator, stochastic and moving average convergence divergence (macd) indicators showing chart buy signals. as such, the indexs firm support levels are seen at 1,600, 1,651 and 1,688, while obvious profit-taking at the resistance areas of 1,699, 1,727 and 1,744 may cap any index rebound. the fbm klcis 18-day and 40-day simple moving averages (sma) depict an emerging trend for its short-term daily chart. the indexs price bars are finally above the 50-day and 200-day sma and this depicts a better upward phase for the fbm klci in the medium to longer term too. due to the upbeat tone for the fbm klci, we are recommending a chart buy on ntpm holdings bhd. a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that two research houses cover this stock with hold calls. ntpm manufactures and trades tissue papers, toilet rolls, serviettes and paper-related products. maybank investment bank bhd does not cover ntpm fundamentally. however, we initiated some technical buy coverage at 96 sen on feb 19 and 22. ntpm currently trades at marginally elevated historical price-earnings ratio of 19.8 times and price-to-book ratio at 2.88 times. its return-on-equity ratio stood at a decent 15.4%. ntpms chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is firmly up. its share price has made an obvious surge since its major weekly wave-2 low of 62 sen in august 2015. since that 62 sen low, ntpm rose to its recent all-time high of rm1.02 this month. as its price broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of 88 sen and 93 sen, look to buy ntpm on any dip to its support areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term uptrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, oscillator and stochastic) have issued clear buy signals and now show firm and obvious indications of ntpms eventual rise towards much higher level. it would attract firm buying activities at the support levels of 88 sen, 93 sen and 99.5 sen. we expect ntpm to witness some mild profit-taking activities at its resistance level and all-time high of rm1.02. its clear upside targets are located at rm1.14, rm1.29, rm1.41 and rm1.58.  lee cheng

carlsberg brewery malaysia bhd emerged relatively unscathed from an excise duty revision on beer and liquor on tuesday.  carlsbergs share price slipped 0.95% to an intraday low of rm12.50 yesterday, but eased back to close at rm12.60, down two sen or 0.16% from the previous days close. its market capitalisation stood at rm3.9 billion. shares in gab, meanwhile, were down two sen or 0.14% to close at rm14, with a market capitalisation of rm4.2 billion. the stock hit an intraday low of rm13.94 in early trading. effective march 1, the government revised the excise duty structure by eliminating ad valorem tax, which effectively resulted in a 10% hike in excise duty on malt beer. we are neutral on the excise duty hike as we think that it is likely for the brewery companies to pass through any additional cost arising from the hike by increasing selling prices, kenanga research said in a note to clients yesterday. the research firm does not think that the brewers are able to capitalise on the excise duty hike by increasing prices beyond the excise duty hike quantum as the anti-profiteering act is effective until june 30, 2016. thus, we do not expect earnings accretion to brewery companies from the excise duty hike, its analyst soong wei siang said in the note. meanwhile, cimb research said the change in tax structure for malt liquor will lead to an estimated hike of 10% to 12% from current levels. hard liquor will face an even harsher increase in excise duty from 75 sen for every 1% of alcohol content per litre to rm1.50. we estimate that this will translate into an increase of almost 100% in excise duty for hard liquor, the firm added. hong leong investment bank research (hlib research) said the news was not a surprise as the market was bracing for an overdue revision in excise duty. the revision in excise duty calculation can be construed as a slight hike. it is akin to the revaluation method imposed by the customs on nov 1, 2013, in which advertising and promotion spending must be imputed into the calculation, said its deputy head of research sia ket ee in his note to clients yesterday. hlib research welcomed this revision as it removes the risk of a substantial adjustment to excise duty to the brewery sector later this year. our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the increase in excise duty in absolute terms is about 85 sen per litre. a standard can of beer is 320ml with about 5% alcoholic content, translating into a duty hike of about 28.3 sen per can."}, "345": {"date_posted": "2/3/2016", "title": "warrants update:hevea-wb offers

response, saying the contents of the blog posts were untrue, defamatory and malicious in nature. cimb research analyst marcus chan reckons that management addressed the issues well and his sense is that institutional investors were comfortable with the explanation. we urge investors not to be distracted by these ongoing non-fundamental and frivolous allegations. in our view, any share price correction is an excellent opportunity for bottom fishing, he says. in an exclusive interview with the edge last month, group managing director yoong hau chun said it was business as usual at heveaboard and stressed that the companys fundamentals were intact. in fact, he said, heveaboard had a happy problem  its production plants in gemas, despite having two manufacturing lines with a

y-o-y from rm42 million in 1hfy15 to rm77 million in 1hfy16. we expect supermax to deliver stronger earnings performance in 2hfy16, driven by new capacity expansion at plants 10 and 11, which should increase capacity by 17% from december 2014 or 2.2 billion pieces per annum. supermax is in the midst of installing another 10 new lines, due to be completed by june. it has already installed 20 new lines, of which, eight have started operations. the stock trades at 12.7 times calendar year 2016 (cy16) price-earnings ratio (per), below its three-year historical mean of 14 times and close to 30% below the sector mean of 18 times. we expect supermaxs discount to its peers to narrow moving forward, given its positive earnings outlook, driven by capacity expansion in the rubber glove business and a new earnings driver from its contact lens business. in addition, we believe that the stock is a laggard relative to its domestic peers and see potential for its share price to catch up. we maintain our add rating, with a higher tp of rm5.25, still based on 18.4 times cy17 per (at a 20% discount to hartalega holdings bhds target per of 23 times). we see improving earnings prospects for supermax, on the back of an estimated fy15 to fy18 earnings per share compound annual growth rate of 29%. stronger earnings performance, better capacity delivery and higher contact lens contributions

this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on february 29, 2016.  kuala lumpur: shares in my eg services bhd (myeg) saw some choppy trade following news that the government had frozen recruitment of foreign workers.  its share price is down 7% from its five-year high of rm2.30 on jan 11. news that the government had decided to suspend the recruitment of all foreign workers to malaysia as it reviews the current pool of foreign labour in the country sent myegs share price tumbling nearly 5% to close at rm2.06 on feb 19 as investors were worried that the freeze would affect the e-government service providers earnings outlook. it closed three sen or 1.39% lower at rm2.13 last friday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm5.12 billion. analysts, however, believe that it is a knee-jerk reaction, with cimb research advising investors to take this short-term share price weakness as an opportunity to accumulate the stock. the news [of the foreign worker freeze] is negative as investors have been factoring in [the] income stream from higher foreign labour registration via new intakes or the amnesty programme. there could be some follow-through modest selling pressure, uob-kay hian head of research vincent khoo told the edge financial daily. however, he opined that the negative impact is likely to be temporary, as the suspension will be eventually lifted given malaysias labour requirement. myeg on feb 11 announced that it had been appointed by the home ministry to manage the rehiring programme for illegal foreign workers. this was an enhancement contract to the appointment letter dated sept 4, 2015. the group had told bursa malaysia that this project would take effect from feb 15 to aug 15, and was expected to contribute positively to its earnings for the financial years ending june 30, 2016 and 2017. no value was disclosed, as myeg said it is dependent on the number of illegal foreign workers successfully registered. there is no official data on the number of illegal workers in malaysia, but it is believed to be in the range of two million to four million. while the number of illegal workers to be legalised by the government is unclear now, it should not be lesser than the number recorded under the previous 6p programme of 1.3 million workers, said khoo. based on our rough estimate, processing one million illegal workers could lift myegs revenue by rm100 million, he added. khoo also recognised that the potential contribution from the illegal worker registration is significant, estimating that by handling one million illegal worker registrations, net profit could come in at rm50 million (trailing-12-month net profit: rm84 million). as for the courier service licence, he is of the view that the contribution would be small at the beginning stage, but this is a low-hanging fruit for myeg as it is tapping its existing infrastructure (delivery of road tax) to run this new business. however, khoo opined that these near-term prospects had already been priced in. we note that there could be other potential earnings growth angles, such as its tie-up with celcom axiata bhd in providing sim cards to foreign workers. myegs share price would be sustainable should it show its capability in rolling out its new projects on hand, khoo added. he believes that myeg has thus far shown its ability to clinch contracts and execute its contracts smoothly. prospects remain positive. opportunities lie in its ability to build more value-added services for its growing database of customers, he said. for cimb research, it believes that investors should take this short-term share price weakness as an opportunity to accumulate myeg shares. potential rerating catalysts include stronger-than-expected registration of illegal foreign workers and [a] successful launch of the customs service tax monitoring project in mid-2016, it said in a note to clients on feb 21. myeg more than doubled its net profit in the first quarter ended sept 30, 2015 (1qfy16) to rm28.5 million from rm12.04 million a year ago, on the back of a 119% increase in revenue to rm60.74 million from rm27.72 million in 1qfy15."}, "351":

currently, we have six medical mushrooms ready for commercial production, including the top seller  cordyceps sinensis and a medical mushroom that has been marketed since 2008. we have also started marketing the second medical mushroom [known as] the tiger milk mushroom, traditionally used to cure respiratory problems, he said. hon said bioalpha also plans to expand its pharmacy network through merger and acquisition (m&a) exercises, and open new retail outlets, in a bid to double sales of its in-house products. we are in talks with several individual pharmacies and retail pharmacy chains for a proposed m&a, said hon. the opening of new retail and pharmacy outlets will be primarily located in the klang valley and johor. currently, bioalpha has one retail pharmacy outlet called lifesprings at solaris mont kiara here. it is also the operator of 12 mediconstant pharmacies after acquiring the chain from ng see hein and loh peng yeow for rm5 million last year. hon said all future expansions will be under the brand of mediconstant, which is a well-known brand in the market. retailing business is interesting and the acquisition of mediconstant holding sdn bhd [in december last year] is expected to provide synergies to our existing healthcare supplement manufacturing business and reduce marketing costs, he said. it also allows us to reach the end customers faster with any new developed product formulations, as in-house marketing would generate greater awareness than through third-party retail pharmacies, he added. bioalpha has also set up a 70:30 joint venture with myangkasa holdings sdn bhd, the countrys largest cooperative organisation, to establish a chain of retail outlets nationwide. under the plan, we will offer a business opportunity to the cooperative members to invest in our pharmacy outlets through franchising, so that we will be able to recover our invested capital. but we will still have ultimate control over the operations and we collect a certain amount of management fees from them, he added. myangkasa currently has around 12,000 cooperatives nationwide and eight million members. we also plan to invite individual members of the cooperatives to be members of mediconstants chain of pharmacies with certain membership privileges, he added. bioalpha is 51.4%-owned by the finance ministry, of which 22.4% is held via khazanah nasional bhd. permodalan nasional bhd also owns a 16.69% stake in the group. the groups revenue has grown at a 20% compound annual growth rate over the past five years. for the fourth quarter ended

higher exports of its herbal products to china. cimb research expects bioalphas net profit to grow 65% over the next two years. excluding 2015s rm2.3 million initial public offering (ipo) expenses, net profit growth over the next two years should be around 40% per year, the research firm said, adding that stronger-than-expected china sales, more pharmacies to be opened or an unexpected

westports", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on february 5, 2016.  westports holdings bhd\n(feb 4, rm3.99)\nmaintain hold with a lower target price of rm4: financial year 2015 (fy15) was a relatively good year for westports holdings bhd. despite global containerised trade volume growth at just 2% year-on-year (y-o-y), westports lifted 8% more volume in fy15, as it gained market share from other regional ports after the formation of the ocean three (o3) alliance at the start of 2015. it secured approval to raise its gateway tariff by 15% effective last november. the fall in oil prices also helped it deliver a 12% rise in pre-tax profits, although the expiry of its tax allowance from end-2014 resulted in a 2.7% fall in core net profit. so why is its share price showing signs of tiredness? investors have derated the stock by 8% over the past three months, as they consider two major issues that will impact westports in 2016. first, gateway volumes have declined 5% to 6% y-o-y for two consecutive quarters, with both import and export cargoes lower y-o-y, while cargoes to/from china showed sustained weakness. second, the container shipping alliance realignment may move in an unfavourable direction for westports, with china shipping container lines co ltd (cscl) likely leaving and neptune orient lines ltd (nol) not coming in. gateway imports fell in the second half of 2015, due to ringgit depreciation and weak malaysian consumer sentiment, but gateway exports surprisingly also fell, mainly due to the weaker chinese economy. we were disappointed that exports did not benefit from the ringgit weakness. this situation is likely to continue in 2016, so we have revised down our gateway volume forecast for fy16 to a 3% y-o-y fall from a 3% y-o-y increase previously. we think gateway volumes should resume single-digit growth from 2017. cscl contributed 8% of westports total container volume in fy15, mostly in trans-shipment (t/s) boxes. after cosco container lines co ltd (coscon) takes over cscl, the latters t/s volume could move to singapore in 2017, which is coscons port of choice in asean. this will be compensated by organic growth from other customers, resulting in flat t/s volumes. we have reflected the worst-case scenario for westports t/s business, but there is room for upside surprises. cma cgm sa is pursuing another partner to replace cscl in the o3 alliance, and this new partner could bring t/s volumes into westports. while cma cgm will retain a base load of nols volume in singapore, westports may enjoy the lions share of future growth of the merged group. it is not impossible that coscon-cscl will also need a two-hub strategy like cma cgm-nol. with one of the lowest t/s tariffs in asean, westports offers carriers an unbeatable value proposition that speaks for itself.  cimb research, feb 4"}, "361": {"date_posted": "5/2/2016", "title": "astro edges up 0.75% on securing epl

chinese investment to be bigger", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on december 23, 2015.  kuala lumpur: despite chinas economic slowdown and the yuans weakness, investors may see a second wave of chinese investment flowing into malaysia,focusing on infrastructure, energy and advanced manufacturing. the establishment of the asian infrastructure investment bank, one belt, one road strategy focusing on infrastructure and interconnectivity, as well as chinas trillion us dollar foreign-exchange reserves are expected to lead to chinese companies investing more in asia, including malaysia. china is a global investor and will put money in countries that fit into its investment position, and malaysia fits into the silk road economic belt, independent economist lee heng guie said, adding that chinas position as malaysias second-largest trading partner and third-largest foreign investor bears testimony to china investing more in malaysia.  based on malaysian investment development authority data, chinas approved manufacturing projects in malaysia jumped from a cumulative capital investment of rm1 billion in 1990 to 2000 to rm2.6 billion in 2001 to 2007, representing an increase of 77.6% per annum (pa). the approved investment rose further by 16.7% pa to rm11.8 billion in 2008 to 2014. in the first nine months of 2015, chinas total approved manufacturing investment amounted to rm1.2 billion. the share of chinas approved manufacturing projects to total foreign approvals in malaysia also rose from a mere 0.2% in 2000 to 12% in 2014, while that of total approved investment (both domestic and foreign investors) also saw a steady rise to 6.6% in 2014 from 0.1% in 2000. lee believes that the second wave of chinese investment will be bigger and targeted in terms of project scale and capital intensity. this is also an expectation, given chinas potential interest to take part in malaysias major infrastructure and economic development projects in public transportation, lee, former chief economist of cimb research, told the edge financial daily. chinas investment flows have in recent years moved into infrastructure, real estate, oil and gas, energy-related, financial service, high-technology, capital-intensive and consumption-oriented sectors, according to lee. for instance, the gemas to johor baru electrified double-tracking project is expected to be awarded to china railway construction corp ltd, and 1malaysia development bhd agreed to sell its power assets under edra global energy bhd to china general nuclear power corp for rm9.83 billion. interestingly, china and japan have expressed keen interest to participate in the high speed rail project between malaysia and singapore. lee said southeast asias infrastructure remains underdeveloped, and expects malaysias planned nuclear power plant to be chinas next potential investment here. the project is estimated to cost rm23.1 billion for a capacity of 2,000mw. lee also noted that chinas manufacturing investment had diversified and become more broad-based. from concentrating in resource- or commodity-based industries such as rubber products and food manufacturing in the 1990s, china now invests in chemicals and chemical products, machinery and equipment, plastic products, basic metal products, electronics and electrical products, as well as non-metallic mineral products. besides, lee highlighted, china is no longer an outcast in the global financial world given its large stock of foreign reserves of us$3.52 trillion (rm15.17 trillion) as at end-october. last month, the international monetary fund announced the inclusion of the yuan as one of its special drawing rights (sdr) currencies. also last month, china said it would grant a 50 billion yuan (rm33.19 billion) quota to malaysia under the renminbi qualified foreign institutional investor programme, invest more in malaysian treasury bonds, and issue yuan-denominated bonds in malaysia. although yuan-denominated trade settlement in the asia-pacific region has increased to 21% now from 7% in 2012, yuan-denominated trades in malaysia only accounted for 2.3% of total trade. lee attributed the current low usage of yuan-denominated trades in malaysia to the preference of multinational corporations operating here for the us dollar and other major foreign currencies for trade settlement, mainly for electronics and electrical products. in contrast, home-grown companies and exporters in the agricultural and resource-based industries have increased the usage of yuan in trades between china and malaysia. however, lee foresees an increasing trend of the usage of yuan for payment in malaysia given its inclusion in the sdr basket, which is a game changer to enhance the yuans status as a global reserve currency. china hopes this inclusion will increase the yuans desirability as a reserve currency for investors and undermine the supremacy of the [us] dollar as a global reserve currency. as long as investors get more comfortable with the stability of the yuan as a store of value, it will rise in prominence as the main currency for payment in trade and investment between china and the rest of the world. he said. besides, he also sees the renewal of the currency swap arrangement between china and malaysia as reinforcing the ongoing commitment by both central banks in promoting the use of local currencies for payment settlement. china and malaysia have renewed the currency swap arrangement of 80 billion yuan for rm90 billion for a further three years, starting april this year."}, "382": {"date_posted": "17/12/2015", "title": "cimb is joint lead manager for us$3.5b issue", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily,

0.27 of a point to 2,088.87, while the dow jones industrial average gained 1.2 points to end at 17,813.39. the fbm klci moved in a quiet range of 27.2 points for the week with high volumes of 2.33 billion to 2.95 billion shares traded. the index closed at 1,683.09 yesterday, down 1.33 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like cimb group holdings bhd, genting malaysia bhd, kuala lumpur kepong bhd, petronas chemicals group bhd and petronas dagangan bhd caused the index to inch down on minor profit-taking activities. the ringgit strengthened to 4.2220 against the us dollar as brent crude turned firmer to us$44.10 (rm186.10) per barrel. the index rose on a rally from a 801.27 low (october 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014), and this represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements after july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,837.28 (low), 1,879.62 (high), 1,766.22 (low), 1,858.09 (high), 1,671.82 (low), 1,810.21 (high), 1,706.18 (low), 1,831.41 (high), 1,774.3 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,685.03 (low), 1,744.19 (high), 1,503.68 (low), 1,691.93 (high), 1,595.22 (low), 1,727.41 (high) and 1,644.29 (low). the indexs daily signals are mainly positive, with the cci, dmi, stochastic and macd indicators showing obvious buy signals. the oscillator indicator remains only marginally negative for now. as such, the indexs obvious support levels are seen at 1,595, 1,644 and 1,683, while heavy profit-taking in resistance areas of 1,688, 1,727 and 1,744 may cap any index advances. the klcis 18-day and 40-day simple moving averages (smas) depict an emerging uptrend for its short-term daily chart. the indexs price bars are now between the 50-day and 200-day smas, and this depicts a neutral phase for the klci in the medium term. due to the better tone for the klci, we are recommending a chart buy on can-one bhd (can-one). a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that no research house covers this stock. maybank investment bank bhd does not cover this stock fundamentally, too.  can-one manufactures tin cans and jerry cans for the edible oil and food industries. its current price-earnings ratio is at a very low level of 7.7 times, while its price-to-book ratio is at a marginally elevated level of 1.19 times. its return on equity is at a fine 14.8%. for the past five years, the companys sales revenue and net income have increased steadily. there was no significant news on the stock recently. can-ones chart trend in the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly up. its share price has made an obvious surge since its major weekly wave-2 low of rm2 in august. since that rm2 low, can-one has risen to its recent high of rm4.70 this month. as its share price broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of rm2.89 and rm3.97, look to buy can-one on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term uptrend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) have issued clear buy signals, and now show firm and obvious indications of can-ones eventual surge towards higher levels. it would attract firm buying activities at the support levels of rm2.97, rm3.97 and rm4.35. we expect can-one to witness minor profit-taking at the resistance levels of rm4.38, rm4.47 and rm4.70. its upside targets are located at rm5.60, rm6.20, rm6.52 and rm6.75. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed in the article

bats profit margin intact", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on november 9 - november 15, 2015.  british american tobacco (m) bhd has raised the prices of its cigarettes again. this, says the company in a press release, is because the excise duty on cigarettes was increased by more than 40% from nov 3. the price hike ranges between 23% and 26%. a 20-stick pack of dunhill cigarettes now costs rm17 compared with rm13.80 before while bats value-for-money brands like pall mall and peter stuyvesant are now priced at rm15.50 compared with rm12.30 previously. the nov 4 announcement sent bats share price down by almost 2% to rm59.62 on that day while five analysts immediately downgraded the heavyweight stock, one to neutral and four to sell. currently, there are 10 sell, six hold and one buy recommendations on bat, according to bloomberg data.  cimb research says in a note that it is difficult to predict by how much sales will decline because the industry has never seen such a steep hike in excise duty before. this could weigh on investor sentiment for at least a year, it adds. we advise investors to switch from tobacco companies to brewers, whose dividend yields are safer. bats dividend yield in fy2016 to fy2017 is now below 5% compared with the brewers over 6%. the brewers exhibit clearer earnings visibility, says the research house, which has a reduce call on the stock and a lower target price of rm55.40. most analysts are concerned that the cigarette manufacturers sales will suffer, although they believe the impact on profit margins will be minimal. the excise duty on cigarettes was hiked in 2013 (by 14%) and 2014 (by 12%) but bat (valuation: 1.50; fundamental: 1.35) managed to keep its net profit margin intact at about 18% by raising its selling prices. nevertheless, amresearch says in a report that it does not expect bats margins and net profit to expand significantly after the latest round of tax hikes. but it opines that the 23% to 26% hike is sufficient to counter any potential contraction in total cigarette sales. this is in view of the anti-profiteering act [currently in force] and a breakdown of the price increase, which shows that the excise duty-related share of the total price hike is 79%. this is higher than the 42% in 2014 and 47% in 2013 but lower than the 90% in 2010 and 70% in 2009. the ratio of price increase to excise increase has also normalised to 1.3 times from 2.5 times previously, amresearch adds. while shrinking profit margins may not be a concern for the cigarette makers, analysts are in agreement about bat potentially losing sales to the illegal cigarette market due to the sharp upward revision of its selling prices. affin hwang research opines that smokers might shift not only towards the illegal market but also e-cigarettes. according to statistics from bat, the illegal cigarette market accounts for about 33.7% of the tobacco industry despite the governments efforts to clamp down on it in recent times. midf research, meanwhile, says historical trends show that a drop in sales due to a price hike is usually followed by a rebound after two to three months. but it warns that things could prove difficult for bat this time around, given the potential threat from vaping, which is gaining in popularity, while illegal cigarettes continue to be widely available. in view of the massive rise in cigarette prices, there is a strong likelihood that some smokers might switch to a cheaper brand or illicit cigarettes or shift to vaping, which is now seen as cheaper than smoking conventional cigarettes. the research house has revised bats earnings for fy2015 and fy2016 downwards by 4% and 5.1%. in its third quarter ended sept 30, bats revenue declined 4% from a year ago to rm1.16 billion while net profit rose 6.4% to rm256.1 million. the company announced that as at sept 30, domestic sales had contracted 10% from a year ago. however, this is an industry-wide issue. statistics show that the total industry volume of legal cigarettes has been shrinking over the last three years. from 13.57 billion sticks in 2012, volume had dropped to 12.18 billion sticks as at the end of 2014. interestingly, bats share price rose steadily despite the excise duty hikes in the last two years. it climbed from rm54 in early 2013 to a new peak of rm70 in december last year. some attributed the upward trend to the quantitative easing in the us that resulted in ample liquidity flowing into asian markets searching for good yields, and bat was one such choice. with the latest gargantuan rise in excise duty, bats shareholders may wonder if the cigarette manufacturer can sustain its generous dividend payments."}, "402": {"date_posted": "23/11/2015",

in the edge financial daily, on november 23, 2015.  kuala lumpur: in a year when foreign investors withdrew from malaysia on the back of declining commodity prices and slowing economic growth, local retail investors have become net buyers so far this month. remisiers and analysts contacted by the edge financial daily said retail investors had been targeting lower-liner stocks highlighted recently. this had been reflected in the fbm small cap indexs 1.54% gain to 15,925.32 points last friday since nov 2, contributing to the 19.22% gain from this years low of 13,357.88 points on aug 25. the fbm ace index shot up by 41.52% to 6,914.53 points last friday in less than three months. at this level, it was nearing its highest close of 7,458.03 points on april 21, 2015. the small cap index comprises the top 98% of companies listed on the main market, but excludes the fbm top 100 index constituents. although there were arguments by market observers and analysts that many small-cap stocks recently favoured by retail investors were backed by strong fundamentals, can the interest be sustained? a senior dealer from kenanga investment bank said the market sentiment so far has been recovering, and retail investors  just like any investor  will start to pull out when the market turns bearish. back-of-the-envelope calculations showed this class of investors daily trade averaging rm1.02 billion between nov 1 and 19, increasing by rm10 million every month since august, when the average stood at rm988.6 million. they (local retail investors) are coming back slowly, as there are more stories on small-caps with good fundamentals coming out. however, im not discounting that many retail participants are there to make a quick buck, the dealer told the edge financial daily. a head of research said plenty of ace market stocks were highlighted and written about recently, and they became trading ideas for retail investors. he listed examples of those stocks as ifca msc bhd, puc founder (msc) bhd and instacom group bhd. notably, their stock prices rose between 4% and 40% last week. instacom, for example, jumped 36.96% to 31.5 sen last friday in just two days after cimb research initiated coverage on the company. the research outfit gave a target price of 72 sen for the telecommunications tower builder, which will soon become an in-house contractor for china railway construction co ltd via an asset injection exercise. to compare, its share price was 23 sen the day before the note was published. however, how the momentum will fare depends on what happens if valuecap sdn bhd enters the market this week. if they choose to go for lower liners, then retail investors might just pull out as the big boys have come to play in their field. people have been speculating whether valuecap will buy the lower liners because they are looking for undervalued stocks, but we have to see if that is the case, said the head of research. the government recently announced that state-owned valuecap would be allocated rm20 billion to help boost the overall market sentiment. up to last thursday, retail investors bought a total of rm7.17 billion worth of shares in november, with net buying amounting to rm88.39 million. while the net buying value is nothing to shout about at a first glance, the value for the three weeks in november already exceeded only two months of this year that saw net buying from local retail investors.  local retail investors share of total trading value on bursa malaysia between nov 1 and 19 was 26.6%, according to data provided by the stock exchange. this was higher than the average of 22.77% recorded in the first 10 months of this year. to note, local retailers total net buying was valued at rm276.15 million in november 2014. trading participation came to 25.9%, with total shares bought amounting to rm9.73 billion and the total value of shares sold at rm9.46 billion. but will this trend be sustainable? thats a very good question, inter-pacific securities sdn bhd head of research pong teng siew mused. i dont think so. he said that historically, whenever there is a sudden deluge in trading volume, it is a sign that the market has peaked. last thursday, 3.41 billion shares were traded in the broader market  according to pong  this was one of the highest daily turnover recorded. history shows that when

since peaking at 19,338.1 points on aug 19, 2014. it subsequently fell 27.93% to 13,937.01 in just four months. nevertheless, pong noted many small caps do have strong fundamentals, which have contributed to the retail investors confidence in those stocks. according to his calculations, the top 300 most profitable companies on bursa malaysia saw an average 12% on-year decline in net profit. but earnings of the bottom 300 companies grew an average 64% year-on-year. but now, the share prices [of some of these small-caps] might have run way ahead of the fundamentals. a lot of expectations

(we are) unsure of pmis move, although they (pmi and jti) are both legally bound to raise prices by a minimum of rm2.60, it added. yesterday, british american tobacco (m) bhd (bat) raised the prices of all its cigarette brands by as much as rm3.20 per pack of 20 sticks, in response to the governments move to increase the tobacco excise duty by more than 40%. the market and analysts were taken aback by the quantum of the excise and bats price hikes, both of which they said were unprecedented. previous excise duty hikes had averaged at 12%, with the last largest increase (+36%) reported in 2005, while cigarette pack price increases averaged at 8% since 2000, said amresearch. hong leong ib research (hlib research) likened the move to the the straw that broke the camels back. the research house said while the off-budget excise duty hike was expected, the magnitude of the hike was not. we believe this development will decimate the legal industry volume, which was down 11% year-on-year in the month of september. we expect the volume to decline further against the challenging economic backdrop and diminishing consumer spending power, said hlib research. kenanga research warned that the price increase will strengthen the illicit cigarettes trade. we turn negative on bat as well as the legal tobacco industry as a whole as the illicit [cigarette] trade might grow by capitalising on the situation and thus pose a greater threat to the legal industry. to recap, the illicit market share [had been reduced by the authorities] from a high of 38.9% [as at] 2013 to 32.3% [as at] 2014, said kenanga research in its note. cimb research said despite the increase in prices, the impact on bats bottom line is likely to be minimal. however, in terms of dividend yields, the research house is advising investors to switch to breweries. we advise investors to switch from tobacco to the brewers as they are safer dividend yielders. bats dividend yield in financial years ending dec 31, 2016 and 2017 is now below 5% compared with the brewers, which are yielding over 6%, said cimb research. the growing presence of vapes (electronic cigarettes) would also pose a challenge to bat, said midf research. in view of the massive price hike in cigarettes, there is a strong likelihood for some smokers to either switch to a cheaper brand, illicit cigarettes or shift to vapes as it is now arguably cheaper than smoking conventional cigarettes, it added. the market reacted negatively to bats (valuation:1.5; fundamental: 1.35) cigarette price hike, with its shares closing down rm1.48, or 2.38%, to

khazanah nasional bhd plans to divest its entire 30% stake in bank muamalat malaysia bhd in the proposed merger between the lender and malaysia building society bhd (mbsb), sources say. it doesnt plan to stay on as a shareholder in the merged entity. it has been looking to sell for a long time now ... it wants cash to exit, a source familiar with the matter tells the edge. another reason for the planned divestment, the source adds, is that bank negara malaysia is not keen on the government investment arm owning major stakes in more than one bank. it already owns 29.34% in cimb group holdings bhd. that it plans to sell the entire 30% stake isnt exactly surprising considering that khazanah has long made it known that it considers the stake a non-core holding, which meant that it was open to letting it go at the right price. last thursday, mbsb said in a stock exchange filing that it obtained the central banks nod to commence talks with bank muamalats shareholders for a proposed merger between the two financial institutions. bank negara has given them three months to complete the negotiations. conglomerate drb-hicom bhd holds the remaining 70% in bank muamalat. mbsb, a non-bank lender, is 65%-owned by the employees provident fund and is about twice the size of bank muamalat in terms of assets and loans.  if it takes off, the merged entity would be the second largest islamic bank in the country, after maybank islamic bank bhd. a merger will enable mbsb to address its high funding cost issue by using bank muamalats wide network of 60 branches nationwide, say analysts. this is because mbsb (fundamental: 1.20; valuation: 3) will be able to tap bank muamalats branches and self-service machines to grow its deposit base. mbsb has only 46 branches. and more importantly, it will allow mbsb to become a full-fledged islamic bank that can tap the interbank money market for funds. the merger will allow mbsb access to bank muamalats branch network, and they can also access the interbank money market, a source of funding currently not available to mbsb as it is not a bank, says an analyst who tracks mbsb. assuming no branches are closed, the merged entity would have 106 branches across the country. a larger network will allow the merged entity to get better access to deposits from retail customers. individual deposits is generally the cheapest form of funding for banks, with interest below the official inflation level. however, the merged entity will still have to address the issue of low retail-based deposits, as both mbsb and bank muamalats deposits from individuals make up 7% to 8% of total deposits, observes analyst david chong of rhb research. cost synergy is a possible merger benefit while asset quality and deposit gathering are potential areas the merged entity may need to address, chong says in an oct 2 report. the combined entity will have total assets of rm62.1 billion and gross loans of rm47.5 billion. this leaves maybank islamic still far ahead in size, with assets and loans of rm160.9 billion and rm121.9 billion respectively. talk of a possible merger between mbsb and bank muamalat has surfaced ever since a planned three-way merger between mbsb, cimb and rhb capital bhd was aborted in january because of unfavourable economic conditions. affin hwang investment bank says that earlier merger talks involving bank muamalat were unsuccessful due to asset quality issues. the edge reported earlier in july that the central bank had given drb-hicom up till february next year  said to be the final extension  to pare down its stake in bank muamalat to at least 40%. drb-hicom, controlled by prominent businessman tan sri syed mokhtar albukhary, had bought the stake from bukhary capital sdn bhd  also controlled by syed mokhtar  in a rm1.069 billion deal back in october 2008. bank negaras condition was for it to eventually pare down the stake. drb-hicom had previously tried to sell down its stake to affin holdings bhd, bank islam malaysia bhd and bahrain-based islamic lender al baraka. industry sources say it has been difficult for drb-hicom to close a deal with the parties it has spoken to so far for two reasons  it wanted to maintain control of the bank and its price expectations were deemed too high. this move to merge with mbsb might work because drb-hicom is being pushed into a corner with the bank negara deadline looming, an industry source says. the conglomerate, which is involved in other businesses like automotive, property and construction, considers banking one of its core businesses. bank muamalat accounted for about 7% of drb-hicoms rm13.687 billion revenue for the financial year ended march 31, 2015 (fy2015). bank muamalat was priced at slightly less than 1.2 times book value when drb-hicom bought its controlling stake. the last islamic banking transaction in the country, in december 2013, was done at a price-to-book value of 1.8 times. this was when bimb holdings bhd bought the remaining 49% stake that it didnt already own in bank islam malaysia bhd for rm2.86 billion from lembaga tabung haji and dubai financial group. analysts said the price was decent relative to the banks return on equity (roe) of 15% to 16%. bank muamalats roe is lower, at 5% in fy2015. the merger will likely be a cash-and-stock deal."}, "413": {"date_posted": "15/10/2015", "title": "auto sector in catch 22 with ringgit in doldrums", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on october 15, 2015.  kuala lumpur: the protracted slump in the ringgits value against all major currencies, particularly the us dollar, is eroding carmakers profit margins, with some expected to lose 6% of their net profits from every 1% weakening of the local currency against the us dollar. year to date (ytd), the ringgit, which ended trading hours on tuesday at 4.1860 against the us dollar, has fallen 19.69% against the greenback, 19.81% against the yen, and 12.08% against the euro. the situation is worsened by slower global growth this year and the prevailing soft consumer sentiment. already, vehicle sales for the first eight months of the year dropped 2.3% on-year to 434,282 units, prompting the malaysian automotive association (maa) to cut its 2015 total industry volume (tiv) forecast to 670,000 units from 680,000. this leaves carmakers in a dilemma. if they raise car prices to mitigate rising costs due to the weaker ringgit, consumers may defer buying now as their disposable income shrinks due to higher costs of living, not just from the multiplier effects from the newly introduced goods and services tax, but also the sweeping toll rate hike announced on monday that is expected to take effect today.  although this did not not deter umw toyota motor sdn bhd from raising the prices of toyota and lexus cars that it distributes by between 4% and 16% from january next year, it has certainly held back the distributors of other marques from going ahead with any price hike  so far. kenanga research analyst desmond chong said umw toyotas move could partially buffer the rising cost pressure, particularly imports (complete built-up vehicles) and components (complete knocked-down kits) costs, but he did not discount the possibility that it could weaken the marques sales volume. as it is, toyota, which was the best-selling non-national brand in 2014, has fallen behind honda malaysia sdn bhd in the passenger marques in the the first seven months of the year (see 2015 ytd market share pie chart). on the other hand, the move could prompt consumers to buy before price adjustment, leading to a sales rise, according to ta securities researchs analyst angeline chin. regardless, chin, does not see the price hike announcement having any more than a minimal impact on parent company umw holdings bhds earnings for the financial year ending dec 31, 2015. meanwhile, local carmakers proton holdings bhd (controlled by drb-hicom bhd) and perusahaan otomobil kedua sdn bhd (perodua) have both said they would maintain their car prices for the time being. foreign carmakers or distributors  including mercedes-benz malaysia sdn bhd, berjaya auto bhd (distributor of mazda), ford motor co and bmw malaysia sdn bhd  have also decided to keep the status quo, though each does not rule out the possibility of a price hike should the ringgit continue to deteriorate. volvo car malaysia sdn bhd managing director keith schafer told the edge financial daily on tuesday that volvos car prices too will remain unchanged for now. it is still too early to decide [to raise prices]. we are trying to balance our portfolio and will continue monitoring the situation. if it gets more expensive to produce here, we may consider it, schafer said over the phone. but the ringgit has regained some losses in value against the us dollar in the past week  it staged its strongest rally since 1998 on oct 7 when it strengthened to 4.2175 against the us dollar. as such, ta securities chin does not expect other carmakers to follow in umw toyotas footsteps. the ringgit has gained in value against the us dollar; i think carmakers may need further consideration before making a decision, she added. but chong pointed out that tan chong motor holdings bhd, which distributes nissan cars, may bow to cost pressures soon and raise prices as it has us-dollar denominated costs. our sensitivity test has showed that every 1% depreciation in the ringgit against the greenback could impact the bottom line of tan chong motor by 6%, he said. nevertheless, kenanga research is neutral on the auto sectors outlook, with an unchanged 2015 tiv forecast of 667,000 units, as it believes auto sales will gain momentum  driven by aggressive advertising and promotion (a&p), festivities and stronger seasonal patterns  though margins will shrink. hong leong investment bank research(hlib), meanwhile, downgraded its sector call to underweight in a report dated sept 18, and reduced its tiv assumption for 2015 by 2% to 649,800 units. hlib analyst daniel wong said the industry suffers from lower margins as a result of higher input costs, while domestic selling prices are fixed in ringgit. even national original equipment manufacturers such as proton and perodua, which have high localisation rates of average 90% are

valuation: 1.65) is currently trading on low valuations, with end-fy16 (ending dec 31, 2016) forward book value per share (p/bv) of 0.7 times and fy16 forward price-earnings (p/e) of seven times. we are excited about its long-term prospects (given its drive for regional expansion, backed by a strong management team and the employees provident fund as its shareholder). rhbcap is ranked fifth highest on our list in terms of upside to long-term target price. the other four stocks ahead of it are all smaller caps, and owg is in pole position, he said. wong said owg is a unique combination of captive food and beverage and a tourism play on genting highlands and penang. if the company executes well, the upside to its share price, according to our calculations, is massive over the next three to five years, he said. as for myeg (fundamental: 2.3; valuation: 1.1), wong said although the stock has appreciated many fold over the past three years, he believes that the companys outlook remains bright and it has several aces up its sleeve. wong likes ghl systems (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 0.4) as its new business model of acquiring merchants and sharing fees charged for credit card usage could potentially transform the company tremendously in the coming years. meanwhile, wong said gamuda scored highest in its long-term stock-picking matrix because of its proven capability to better leverage its strength and expertise into executing larger-scale projects over longer periods of time. assuming that the execution of the penang transport master plan kicks off with the rm5.3 billion high-priority light rail transit project and is completed within the next five to six years, this could translate into new potential reclaimed land bank of 800 acres (323.7ha) based on rm150 per sq ft break-even reclamation cost. imputing this component based on the groups (gamudas) 60% stake in the project delivery partner joint venture would raise the target price further to rm7.20 based on a similar discount to revised net asset value, he added. cimb researchs end-2018 target price for rhbcap is rm13.12, which is more than double yesterdays closing price of rm6.22. we think that the target price is reasonable, as it only implies a fy19 price-earnings ratio of 10 times and end-fy18 price to book value of 1.2 times, said wong. the end-2020 target price is set at rm15.28. owg is given a 2018 target price of rm6.67, and rm14.66 for 2020, while cimb ib has a 2018 target price on myeg at rm6.65 and 2020 target price of rm9.65. cimb researchs 2018 target price on ghl is rm2.40, more than double the closing price of rm1.13 yesterday. the stocks 2020 target price is set at rm3.65. in the healthcare field, cimb research plucked drug maker hovid to have the best long-term earnings upside, with a major assumption that the clinical trials for its tocovid suprabio vitamin will enjoy some positive progress. the stocks 2018 target price is rm1, while 2020s target price is rm1.30."}, "420": {"date_posted": "9/10/2015", "title": "cimb 'strategically placed' to help asean startups -tengku zafrul", "article": " kuala lumpur (oct 9): cimb group holdings bhd's group chief executive officer tengku datuk zafrul aziz said the financial services provider was \"strategically placed\" to help budding entrepreneurs, due to the group's regional presence. in a statement today, tengku zafrul said malaysia-based cimb could help startups established a presence in countries like thailand and indonesia, where cimb had set up operations. tengku zafrul's statement was in conjunction with cimb's partnership with startupbootcamp fintech singapore. as a leading asean universal banking group, cimb is strategically placed to assist businesses, including startups in the region, to realise their potential. we are certainly excited to partner startupbootcamp fintech to not only advance financial innovation in the region, but also create in-roads for these fintech businesses in growing markets, such as thailand and indonesia. \"furthermore, as cimb continues to spur our own innovation space, this partnership also opens up further avenues for collaboration and cross-pollination of ideas with these startups to grow fintech in asia. i am confident that cimb would be able to adopt some of the innovative solutions that are brought to fruition through our investment into this partnership, tengku zafrul said.\n\nstartupbootcamp fintech's website indicates that the company serves as a platform for budding entrepreneurs to gain access to investors and mentorship.\n\n\"in return, we ask for 6% equity. all contracts are simple, transparent, and available for all to see,\" startupbootcamp fintech wrote on its website. in malaysia, cimb's shares rose three sen or 0.6% at 3:27pm today to rm4.95, for a market capitalisation of rm42.03 billion. the stock saw some 10 billion shares transacted.

price (tp) of rm5.43: malaysia airports holdings bhds (mahb) stock has declined close to 40% since peaking in late 2013 due to a variety of factors, including capacity cuts and a network rationalisation of major airlines in malaysia, the step-up in costs after the commissioning of klia2 from may 2014, and a dilution from two equity issues in 2014 and 2015. passenger traffic at mahbs malaysian airports grew just 1.9% on-year for the cumulative eight months in 2015, against 4.7% growth in 2014 and 18.4% growth in 2013.  the strong 2013 traffic growth was driven by the entry of malindo air from march 2013, which triggered a strong capacity response from incumbents malaysia airlines (mas) and airasia. demand responded enthusiastically to the decline in domestic airfares. a much slower pace of passenger traffic growth last year was caused by the mh370 and mh17 incidents, which discouraged tourist inflows into malaysia, coupled with airlines reigning in capacity growth to limit the fare deterioration. this continued into 2015, and mas began cutting its capacity earnestly from august onwards. looking into 2016, the weaker ringgit will likely discourage malaysian outbound tourists, leading to weak passenger traffic growth forecasts of less than 5%. the opening of klia2 from may 2014 caused operating and interest costs to surge from a quarterly average of rm540 million in 2013 to almost rm700 million in the past four quarters. this could not be recouped given the weaker traffic growth, even with government compensation from february 2014 onwards equivalent to about 10% of the current passenger service charges (psc). our financial year 2015 (fy15) core earnings forecasts are 70% lower than the peak in fy12, while our fy15 core earnings per share forecasts are 77% lower given the two equity issues in 2014 and 2015. we expect mahbs earnings to bottom out in 2015, and recover gradually thereafter with a slow passenger volume expansion. mahbs share price has probably also hit bottom, as it is currently being valued at a price-to-book value of only 1 time. the ultimate prize is the eventual raising of klia2s psc to close the current gap with the psc at the main terminal building. this can enhance earnings substantially and lift our tp to above rm7.  cimb research, oct 8"}, "422": {"date_posted": "7/10/2015", "title": "malaysian

the region for three consecutive days after a short-lived rebound last week. the concern about china, the worlds second-largest economy, heading to a slower growth track continued to take centre stage in the investing community. chinas official purchasing managers indexs drop to 49.7 in august, was seen as evidence of an economic slowdown. meanwhile, manufacturing sector growth in the united states slowed to its weakest pace in more than two years which also posed a concern. on the home front, equity strategists started cutting their year-end target for the fbm klci following the disappointing corporate results for the financial quarter ended june 30. yesterday, the klci dropped below the 1,600 level again. the benchmark index shed 19.02 points or 1.2% to 1,590.19 points. oil prices made a u-turn falling back to below us$50 (rm211) per barrel, dampening the local sentiment further. west texas intermediate october crude fell 2.16% to us$44.43 per barrel, while brent crude declined 1.57% to us$48.78 per barrel. hlib research has cut its year-end target to 1,710 against a forecast of 1,880 previously amid anticipation of a contraction in earnings per share (eps) for 2015. post-reporting season earnings revisions, the 2015 eps is now expected to contract by 1.6% (versus a growth of 2.6%), the second consecutive year of contraction. however, due to a lower base, the 2016 eps growth has been revised higher to 8.3%. with contraction in the 2015 eps, as well as lingering external and internal uncertainties, fbm klci year-end target has been lowered to 1,710, based on lowered 15 times 2016 earnings, said hlib research. on the other hand, cimb investment bank bhd expects the 2015 eps to fall 1.4% compared with its forecast of 2.6% earlier, and has reduced its year-end target to 1,700 points from 1,800 points. in view of the earnings cuts, our end-2015 klci target has been lowered from 1,800 points to 1,700 points, based on an unchanged 15.5 times price-earning ratio target. we introduce our end-2016 klci target of 1,850 times, based on the same target basis. our preferred sectors remain the construction and utilities sector, and selective smaller-cap stocks, said cimb. ta securities also revised down its target for the klci to 1,710 from 1,810, and downgraded earnings forecasts for 2015 and 2016 by 3.8% and 3.2% respectively. with the revisions, we now expect 2015 earnings to grow by only 2% year-on-year (y-o-y). the 2016 earnings are projected to grow by 12.3% y-o-y, mostly on the assumption that the economic cycle and commodity prices will gradually recover, benefiting sectors such as banking, oil and gas, and plantation, said the research house. maybank investment bank bhd has a gloomier outlook on the klci, cutting its end-2015 target to 1,610 from 1,830, saying that its initial target was unrealistic. the research house also introduced an end-2016 target of 1,750 points, assuming the political environment in malaysia quietens down as 2015 ends. a more defined target for end-2016 would depend on several factors which are still volatile at this juncture. our base case assumes that political noises will quieten down by this year end, said maybank. jupiter securities chief market strategist benny lee told the digitaledge daily that banking stocks were still leading the decline in the benchmark index. banking stocks were leading the decline in the klci, as i noticed that malayan banking bhd (maybank) has fallen a lot. the rebound yesterday (tuesday) was probably just a technical rebound, as the market is still bearish, lee said. it is noted that maybank (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 2.25) led the decline in banking stocks after it fell 35 sen or 4% to close at rm8.42, while rhb capital bhd (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 2.1) and cimb group holdings bhd (fundamental: 1.05; valuation: 2.25) fell 1.5% and 1.9% respectively. lee added that there are no signs of recovery for the local market anytime soon, and expects the index to continue trading below the 1,600 level, with an immediate support level of 1,560 for the week. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys

jumped to 1.90 sen for the current quarter, from 1.10 sen.</p> <p>in a filing with bursa malaysia today, the company said the increase in revenue and profit is primarily attributable to an increase in revenue contributions from its online renewal of fwp and ancillary services, as well as higher transaction volume from its existing services, as compared to the preceding quarter, which was offset by an impairment of investment amounting to rm857,000.</p> <p>for the full year (fy15), the company saw its annual net profit up by 36% to rm68.14 million, from rm50.11 million previously.</p>

jaeger-lecoultre step in as sponsors", "article": "  ocbc bank (m) bhd and swiss luxury watchmaker jaeger-lecoultre have stepped in as sponsors for the edge billion ringgit club (brc) 2015. in its sixth installation, the brc aims to recognise malaysias largest corporates for jobs well done  not only in raking in profits but also in corporate responsibility (cr) efforts. ocbc has been the main sponsor since brcs inception in 2010. senior vice-president and corporate and commercial banking head jeffrey teoh says awards like the brc act as an incentive for companies to adopt a holistic approach to doing business. he says that the purpose of business is increasingly recognised as a platform for providing meaningful service to humanity, with profits being the means by which to keep such a meaningful entity viable. i think a company exists as part of a whole ecosystem in terms of regulators, shareholders and stakeholders, he says. so, if you dont have an event to recognise that, it is all for naught, it is not sustainable. he says ocbc enjoys being a part of the annual event, not so much as an aid to brand building, but because it is the right thing to do. i think the not-so-obvious elements [in business] such as how you operate in an environment where there is growing awareness of cr, how we function in an economic manner without destroying the environment and how we operate in a manner where we give opportunities for malaysians to broaden their talent ... these things do not get much coverage, but thats why i think the brc is very different compared with other awards, he says. it is more holistic. it is a more balanced scorecard. jaeger-lecoultre malaysia country manager reena tan says brcs high standard of assessment, which is based on quantitative and qualitative criteria, sets the event apart from the others in the business community. i think it is important to give recognition to corporations that have done tremendously well all round, not just in terms of profits but also their contributions to the malaysian society, she says. as jaeger-lecoultre, too, plays a big role in cr, it has had a strong partnership with unesco (united nations educational, scientific and cultural organization) since 2008, to protect the 47 marine areas listed as world heritage sites. she says that the company has even made a short video titled the guardians on glacier bay national park. the us national park is a hotbed for marine biodiversity, recognising the work of scientists and project managers in preserving the site. the chief executive officer (ceo) of the brc company of the year award winner will receive a master eight days perpetual 40 watch. the watch has a perpetual calendar and boasts an eight-day power reserve, thanks to its twin barrels that store up a considerable amount of energy.  technically programmed to require no manual correction before the year 2100  even the noblest mechanisms cannot keep track of the century years that are not leap years  it will continue to provide an accurate display of the date, the day of the week, the month and the year in four digits, along with the power reserve, the moon phase, the alternation between night and day, and even the security zone between 10pm and 3am during which no changes must be made. tan says the watch is a symbol of the values inherent in exemplary leadership and for steering a company to the billion-ringgit mark. jaeger-lecoultre is a visionary brand that celebrates accomplishment in fine watchmaking, combining elegance and confidence, she adds. hence, our values are, in a way, a fine representation of the corporation/ceo who will be receiving the jaeger-lecoultre timepiece. the brc recognises companies with a market capitalisation of rm1 billion and above as at march 31 each year. the shortlisted companies, which are added to the annual list automatically once they fulfil the requirements, are evaluated based on growth in profit before tax, returns to shareholders and cr commitments, among others. the cr initiative component is evaluated by a panel of judges, which includes an ocbc representative. the brc awards include malaysias outstanding ceo, most profitable company, highest profit growth company and best performing stock. previous winners of the malaysias outstanding ceo award were public bank group chairman tan sri teh hong piow, cimb group chairman datuk seri nazir razak, ammb holdings bhd chairman tan sri azman hashim, airasia group ceo tan sri tony fernandes, former malayan banking bhd president and ceo datuk

" kuala lumpur: lady luck is on the side of the two public-listed number forecast operators (nfos)  berjaya sports toto bhd (btoto) and magnum bhd, both of which achieved double-digit net profit growth in the latest quarterly earnings. however, investment analysts warned that investors should not get overly excited about the higher-than-usual profit growth, noting that there has been a consistent decline in ticket sales per draw for the past few quarters. btotos (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 2.1) net profit jumped 11.8% to rm77.51 million for the fourth quarter ended april 30, 2015 (4qfy15). its annual net profit grew 9.6% to rm360.15 million. for magnum (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 2), its net profit rose 10% to rm90.76 million for the first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1qfy15). it seems exciting, judging by the latest profit numbers. however, at a closer look, the revenue from the gaming segment is shrinking. btoto, which offers the most lotto games among the three nfos in peninsular malaysia, saw its gaming revenue fall 4.1% year-on-year (y-o-y) due to lower ticket sales plus a fewer number of draws, compared with the previous year. meanwhile, magnums gaming revenue fell 0.15% y-o-y due to one less draw, which was mitigated by higher sales from the jackpot game and contributions from the new game. cimb analyst marcus chan told the edge financial daily that ticket sales per draw of the nfos have been contracting for the past six to seven quarters. i think it (the trend) will continue for the next one year, as the operators face competition from illegal operators due to the lack of enforcement, chan said. chan noted that the implementation of the goods and services tax (gst) also posed challenges to the nfos  as they had indicated that they would absorb the 6% gst  which he believes would impact about 10% of their bottom line. he said magnum is more appealing than btoto in terms of dividend payments. according to him, magnum has committed a dividend payout of five sen per share for every quarter, which translates into a dividend yield of about 7.4%, based on last fridays closing of rm2.70. meanwhile, btoto paid out 21.5 sen for fy15, which translated into a lower-than-expected dividend yield of 6.5% over a share price of rm3.25, he added. alliancedbs cheah king yoong pointed out that it could be overly simplistic to examine the nfos financial results based purely on the quarterly performance because some quarters could be good due to seasonality, luck factors or the accumulation of jackpot/lotto prizes that attracted stronger buying interests. if we review the nfos gaming revenues on an annual basis, the operating environment remained challenging over the past few years as ticket sales were on a declining trend, while the higher profits could be supported by lower prize payouts and contributions from other operations, he told the edge financial daily in a phone interview. in the case of btoto, cheah said its quarterly profit increased y-o-y partly due to a lower prize payout ratio (better luck factor) and contributions from hr owen, while its core gaming operations remained competitive. as such, investors should not be too excited about its strong y-o-y earnings growth for 4qfy15, he said. although we have imputed the gst impact to our earnings model, we remain cautious that the groups near-term earnings prospects could be dragged by lower ticket sales due to the weaker consumer sentiment post-implementation of the gst, which is difficult to gauge at this juncture, cheah added. an analyst at a local investment bank told the edge financial daily that despite the drop in ticket sales per draw of both companies for the past three years, the pace of 2% to 3% is not alarming. basically, i expect an approximately 3% growth of ticket sales at gross level [inclusive of the gst] for both companies this year, said the analyst, who wished to remain anonymous. he said btoto had better luck for fy15, as its payout rate was around 60%, and it had a relatively lower risk than magnum due to more games to diversify its risk. for magnum, he said, the payout rate was theoretically 66% to 67%, but it was 65% from 69% for the last two years, so his assumption was 65%. he also said he focuses on the valuations of companies that have come down sharply, which lead to attractive yields. over the past one year, btotos share price went down 9.82%, while magnum went down 4.96%. the analyst said btotos share price dropped more than the 6% of the gst, so the share price is likely bottoming out, and he believes now is the time to accumulate the shares. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based

"title": "banking outlook still weak", "article": " banking stocks, once a hot favourite among investors, wont be making a comeback anytime soon, going by the weak financial results that have trickled in for the first quarter and ongoing concerns about asset quality. the mostly neutral calls that analysts have on the sector are likely to stay, even as a slew of earnings downgrades kicks in following the disappointing results of banks like cimb group holdings bhd and affin holdings bhd (ahb). ammb holdings bhd, which last friday reported its earnings for the full year ended march 31, 2015, revised downwards its growth targets for the current year to reflect the more challenging operating environment ahead. david chong, a banking analyst at rhb research institute, says there are no catalysts to prompt an upgrade of the banking sector as yet. he points out that the first quarter has seasonally been a weak one for banks. the environment is still challenging  loan growth has slowed, margins are still under intense pressure, and on the fee-based side, capital market activities havent really kicked in to give banks a boost. additionally, asset quality  not an issue in the previous years  is now something they need to watch, he tells the edge. he currently has a buy call on only one banking stock, public bank bhd. half of the eight malaysian banking groups  public bank (fundamental: 1.8; valuation: 0.91), cimb group (fundamental: 1.05; valuation: 2.1), ahb (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 2.25) and ammb (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 3.0)  have already turned in their results for the quarter ended march 31. except for public banks, the report cards were deemed poor. the results of ahb, the countrys second smallest lender, in particular, caught analysts by surprise. its first-quarter net profit fell  by 79% from a year ago and by 86% from the preceding quarter (4qfy2014)  to rm30 million. this accounted for a mere 5% of analysts consensus forecast for the full year. the shortfall was caused by ahbs one-off loan loss provision of rm124.1 million that quarter  the highest quarterly provision the group has made since the fourth quarter of 2005  at its commercial banking arm, affin bank. it had provided just rm51.5 million in 4qfy2014. with that, ahbs asset quality, as measured by the gross impaired loan (gil) ratio, worsened to 2% compared with 1.8% in the preceding quarter. we observe a jump in impairment of loans extended to the finance, insurance and business services sector by rm149.3 million in 1qfy15 as compared with the preceding quarter, notes midf research analyst kelvin ong. the weak results prompted several analysts to lower their earnings estimates for ahb. rhb research cut its fy2015-fy2017 net profit forecasts by 12%, to 25%. while 2015 will see the first full-year consolidation of (ahbs) hwangdbs investment bank acquisition, we expect asset quality to hog the spotlight instead, following the deterioration noted in 1q2015 results, the research house said in a recent note to clients. last wednesday, cimb, the countrys second largest lender, announced a first-quarter net profit of rm580.1 million, which came in at just 14% of analysts consensus estimates for the full year. it missed expectations largely because of high loan loss provisions at its indonesian bank and a one-time restructuring cost of rm202 million relating to the rationalisation of its investment banking business. the net profit was 45.6% lower than that of the previous corresponding quarter because of a 379.4% rise in loan loss provisions to rm534.3 million. the provisions in the quarter were nevertheless lower than the rm919.2 million in 4qfy2014, which helped cimbs earnings jump 189.6% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. its gil ratio worsened slightly to 3.18% from 3.09% as at end-december. cimb told analysts that provisions for bad loans in indonesia would remain high in the second quarter, but less than that in the previous two quarters. if provisions from indonesia continue to trend lower and if there is a boost in capital market activity, then cimbs second-quarter earnings should be better than the first. but then, there is also the question of how much restructuring costs they will take in, rhbs chong observes. just two weeks ago, cimb announced a mutual separation scheme (mss) for its employees in malaysia and indonesia in a bid to reduce costs within the group. staff costs make up 55% of the groups total cost. cimb had incurred a cost of rm217 million in its last mss exercise in 2013, which saw 1,217 staff take up the offer. this time around, the cost could double, as the mss also involves the indonesian operations, cimb told analysts last week. its weak start to the year also has analysts questioning whether it will be able to meet its return on equity (roe) target of 11% (excluding restructuring costs) for fy2015. cimb cited higher-than-expected net interest margin (nim) pressure and challenging economic conditions as key challenges to the target. while cimb had earlier guided for nim compression of 5 to 15 basis points, management now thinks nim may compress by around 20 basis points, says rhb research. it cut its fy2015 net profit forecast for cimb by 16%. meanwhile, mid-sized lender ammb reported an 8% growth in net profit for the full year (fy2015) to rm1.92 billion, but analysts point out that the earnings were boosted by exceptional gains. underlying profit was down by 3%. the groups revenue fell by 4.8% to rm9.14 billion, while roe came in at 13.8%. following the results, ammbs management guided for a more moderate net profit growth of 3% to 5% for fy2016, and roe of 12% to 12.5%. it had earlier eyed net profit growth of 6% to 10% and roe of 14%. the issue is that nim is still expected to contract by 15 to 20 basis points in fy2016, an analyst notes. in the fourth quarter of fy2015, ammbs net profit grew 12% to rm519.2 million, mainly because of write-backs that mitigated the impact of lower revenue. its gil ratio improved to 1.79% from 1.88%. public bank fared the best among the banks. last month, it reported a 15.2% rise in its first quarter net profit to rm1.17 billion despite the tougher environment, helped by a decent increase in net interest income and non-interest income. the results came in within analysts expectations. its gil improved to 0.6% from 0.7%. according to bloomberg data, public bank has performed the best among the eight banking groups in the stock market for the year to date, with a total return of 6.36%, followed by malayan banking bhd (maybank) (4.58%) and cimb (4.26%).  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on may 25 - 31, 2015."}, "451": {"date_posted":

million in convertible bonds. in total, the two associates will receive rm1.11 billion, most of which will be used to repay amounts owing to airasia. the announcement will likely put a floor on airasias share price, or even result in a relief rally, particularly when the short sellers cover their positions. in the long term, airasia still has to make iaa and aap sustainably profitable

from monday to friday last week, net selling by foreign institutions was rm852.7 million and net buying by local institutions was rm852 million. decliners continued to outpace gainers two-to-one on the klci. the top gainers were petronas dagangan bhd (+4.2% from last friday), ppb group bhd (+2.3%) and cimb group holdings bhd (+2.1%). the top three decliners on the index were felda global ventures holdings bhd (-8.5%), sapurakencana petroleum bhd (-7%) and ioi properties group bhd (-4.5%). markets in asia were bearish and even the strong bullish china market is taking a breather.

established another temporary support at 1,718 points after it rebounded yesterday. the trend remained bearish below the short- and long-term 30- and 200-day moving averages and the index stayed below the ichimoku cloud indicator. the cloud is currently thin, and normally the market rebounds. momentum indicators like the rsi and momentum oscillator were flat despite the decline and this weak bullish divergence indicates some support. the rsi indicator and other oscillators indicate that the klci is oversold and as i mentioned last week, this may create some buying interest. the index remained below the middle band of the bollinger bands indicator but the bands are starting to contract. this indicates that the bearish momentum is slightly weakening. the market remains bearish but the momentum has started to ease. however, a strong reversal is needed to boost market confidence. this can only happen if the klci can climb above the immediate resistance level range of between 1,750 and 1,760 points. failure to overcome this level indicates that sentiment is still bearish and the index may start to decline, especially when the temporary support level at 1,718 points is broken. a breakout below this level means that the index is set to trend towards a stronger support level at 1,675 points. there is no opportunity in the market as most sector indices are declining. even the bullish technology sector is starting to face resistance. second-liners started to take a beating last week and this may continue in the next one or two weeks. hence, it is better to stay out of the market. benny lee is chief market strategist for jupiter securities sdn bhd. jupiter securities is a participating broker in bursa malaysia. he can be contacted at [emailprotected]. the views

etfs see low trading volume", "article": " although exchange-traded funds (etfs) are widely traded in developed markets, it is not the case here, with only seven such instruments listed on bursa malaysia. the local bourse saw just 7.86 million units of etfs worth rm9.96 million traded in the first quarter of this year. last year, only 54.15 million units of etfs worth rm59.15 million changed hands, according to bursa. in fact, the fbm klcis single-day trading volume of about two billion shares easily surpasses etfs total volume traded in a year. heavyweights such as malayan banking bhd garnered an average daily trading volume of about 10 million shares. bursa malaysia director of securities market ong li lee tells the edge that awareness of the benefits of etf investing is still very low in malaysia. unlike a conventional unit trust, etfs do not have commissioned sales agents to promote them, she says. the annual fee for managers of etfs is low at between 0.1% and 0.65%. a remisier tells the edge that even if etfs are performing, the market  being sentiment and momentum driven  would shun away from perceived illiquid counters. as at end-march, assets under management of etfs listed on bursa had increased 83.5% to rm1.04 billion from 10 years ago, when the first etf was listed on the local bourse. globally, us$2.7 trillion were allocated to etfs as at the end of last year, singapore exchange said in an update on april 20, 2015. according to singapore exchange, bmo global asset management anticipates that over the next five years, the global etf industry will double to us$6 trillion. the seven etfs listed on bursa are abf malaysia bond index fund, ftse bursa malaysia klci (fbm klci-ea), myetf dow jones islamic market malaysia (djim) titan 25 (myetf-djim25), cimb ftse asean 40 malaysia, cimb ftse china 50, myetf msci malaysia islamic dividend (myetf-mmid) and myetf msci sea islamic dividend (myetf-msead). fbm klci-ea, managed by aminvestment services bhd, offers exposure to the 30 biggest listed companies in the malaysian stock market. it reaped 1.2% annual returns as at end-march this year. in the same period, the fbm klci grew 0.33% to 1,830.78 points (see graph). cimb ftse china 50, which tracks the ftse china 50 index that gives exposure to the 50 largest and most liquid chinese stocks listed and traded on hong kongs stock exchange, posted a 42.43% annual return as at end-march. meanwhile, the ftse china 50 index soared 25.61% during the same period. one of the benefits of etf investing is diversification. as an etf is a fund consisting of many stocks, investors will be able to minimise single-stock risks that they are subject to in their portfolio, says ong. even more diversification benefits can be obtained by investing in different asset classes, such as a bond etf or foreign market etf, that have low correlation with the malaysian stock market. no sales charges and low annual management fees mean a low breakeven point for investors, she adds. an etf is traded like a stock during market hours. for example, if a market rises during the day, an investor who buys the etf in the morning will be able to benefit from the rising prices. etf shareholders are entitled to a share of the profits, such as earned interest or dividends paid. most etfs pay dividends to their holders either half-yearly or yearly. also, the etfs underlying constituents are announced daily via bursa, which allows investors to make more informed investment decisions, she says. cimb-principal asset management chief investment officer arnold lim says an etf is liquid and flexible as units can be acquired or disposed of in standard lot sizes as prescribed in the prospectuses. the objective of an etf is to track an index as closely as possible. etfs tend to be fully invested in the underlying securities that are the constituents of the index at all times. etfs are passively-managed funds designed to mirror an index. they have lower expense ratios compared with traditional unit trust funds, lim says, adding that they provide the diversification advantages of an index unit trust fund. meanwhile, i-vcap management sdn bhd ceo mahdzir othman tells the edge that awareness and interest among the public in etfs have increased, albeit slowly. in the secondary market, there has been some improvement in the trading volume of selected etfs, particularly china-underlying etfs, given the interest in chinas equity market, he notes. investors have yet to fully warm to the idea of investing in etfs given their low liquidity trading, even though investors are generally aware of the cost-efficiency of an etf against the high cost or charges of other investment fund products, says mahdzir. i-vcap, a subsidiary of valuecap sdn bhd, is the fund manager of three etfs, namely myetf-djim25, myetf-mmid and myetf-msead. valuecap is an investment firm jointly owned by khazanah nasional bhd, kumpulan wang persaraan (diperbadankan) and permodalan nasional bhd. myetf-msead, which was listed last week, is an open-ended fund with an approved size of 500 million units and an initial price of rm1 per unit. it closed 1.03% higher at 99 sen last friday against its closing price on may 7, the day that it got listed. the fund tracks the msci south east asia imi islamic high dividend yield 10/40 index, which comprises up to 30 shariah-compliant yielding stocks including keppel corp ltd, singapore telecommunications ltd, philippine long distance telephone company and ascendas india trust, which are all listed on the stock exchanges of southeast asian countries. the distribution channel for etfs can be further enhanced by engaging more financial intermediaries such as stockbrokers, remisiers and financial planners to further promote etfs to the investing public, says mahdzir. he explains that the unit prices of etfs on bursa are made available by the market makers of the etf. the unit prices quoted are based on the prevailing net asset value per unit of the etfs. instead of buying all the component stocks that represent an index, investors can replicate and have similar exposure at a very cheap price for as low as 100 units when they buy an etf, he says.  this article first appeared in capital, the edge malaysia weekly, on may 18 - 24, 2015."}, "466": {"date_posted": "28/5/2015", "title": "thong guan

bearish momentum eased yesterday as the decline was weaker and the movement formed a doji-like japanese candlesticks chart pattern that indicates uncertainty. it also indicates support when the trend is bearish. momentum indicators like the rsi, macd and momentum oscillator continued to decline, indicating strong bearish momentum. furthermore, the klci is trading at the bottom band of the expanding bollinger bands indicator. however, the rsi indicator is moving towards its oversold level and therefore the market may stage a technical rebound. market sentiment and the klci trend remained bearish, and this may continue in the short term unless the index climbs back above the broken support level at 1,775 points. however, the doji pattern at oversold levels could attract bargain hunters. therefore, we expect a technical rebound this week but the increase may be capped at 1,775 points. if the index is unable to break above this level, further downside is expected for the index and the next support level can only be found at 1,700 points.  benny lee is chief market strategist for jupiter securities sdn bhd. jupiter securities is a participating broker in bursa

valuation: 1.80) will be able to sustain its profitability for the rest of the year. due to the strong us dollar, it raked in a net profit of rm50.19 million in 1qfy2015 ended dec 31, up 65.89% from rm30.25 million a year ago. jcys gross profit would improve 5% if it trimmed its workforce by 5,000 to 13,000 in the next three to five years, wong remarks. labour accounts for a substantial amount of my cost of sales, thus [theres] room for cost-cutting via automation. we will spend rm200 million to rm300 million on automating our plants over the next five years. he is positive about the companys current order book following quality issues among its peers. a stronger us dollar, coupled with low crude oil prices, will benefit jcy in the near future, wong observes. the slump in oil prices has lowered the cost of the companys raw materials, like aluminium and steel, he says. in fact, since the drop in oil prices, aluminium ingot prices have fallen from almost us$2,300 per tonne to around us$1,800. on the average selling price of the four components, wong believes it will continue to decrease as new technology is introduced that is more cost-effective. as for potential mergers and acquisitions, he says jcy is in talks with several parties but nothing has been finalised yet. the price has to be right, he remarks. as at dec 31, 2014, the group had cash and bank balances of rm320.62 million and total short-term borrowings of rm111.56 million. talking about the hdd sector, wong says there may be some m&a but the problem for hdd parts manufacturers lies in their capability to make multiple products. its a consolidation [mode in the industry]. if you dont have economies of scale, it will be very challenging for the companies, he cautions. he opines that the catalysts in the hdd market include pent-up demand from new gaming consoles (xbox and playstation), increased usage of surveillance cameras and equipment on aircraft that record engine performances. meanwhile, jcy is contemplating building another plant in johor baru. it all depends on the land cost and degree of savings we achieve in the future, says wong. the group also has plants in china and thailand. as a supplier, jcy would benefit if hitachi global storage technologies (hitachis hard drive business) and western digital merge in china (see accompanying story). that aside, seagate is reportedly investing rm1.05 billion in penang, where it will purchase land to support its operations. this is good news for jcy because its plants are mainly in malaysia while seagates are located in thailand and china. the company supplies limited volumes of base plates, top covers and anti-discs to seagate, which accounted for only about 10% of its income in fy2014. in an april 10 report, cimb research analyst mohd shanaz noor azam says robust cloud storage growth is expected to spur hdd storage demand. although we see a mixed outlook for hdd shipments this year, we think data storage requirements will continue to rise, driven by enterprise hdd storage demand.  note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers. a score of 3 suggests strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. visit www.theedgemarkets.com for more details on a companys financial dashboard.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on april 27 - may 3, 2015.

valuation: 2.4) said some of the contracts included delivering offshore crane and tower crane to oil and gas clients. the group is expected to deliver the cranes to the respective customers between 2015 and 2016. higher loan impairment and overhead expenses have eroded affin holdings bhds net profit by 79% to rm30.09 million or 1.55 sen per share for the first quarter ended march 31,2015, from rm142.73 million or 9.55 sen per share a year ago.  in a filing to bursa malaysian, affin (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 2.25 ) said the lower profit before tax was mainly due to higher allowance for loan impairment of rm130.4 million and higher overhead expenses of rm88.6 million. this was despite the net of increase in other operating income and islamic banking income of rm76.3 million of rm5.5 million, respectively. however, affin's 1qfy15 revenue increased to rm448.93 million, against rm317.09million last year  an increase of 20.97%. moving forward, the group expects its commercial banking sector to face stiff competition in the retail and fixed deposits market, against existing competitors, as well as players from the non-financial services sector. cimb group holdings bhd, the country's second-biggest lender, saw its net profit plunged 45.6% to rm580.12 million or 6.89 sen per share in the first quarter ended march 31, 2105 (1qfy15), from rm1.07 billion or 13.15 sen per share a year ago, mainly due to higher corporate loan provisions from indonesia. revenue for 1qfy15, however, rose 4% to rm3.68 billion, from rm3.54 billion in 1qfy14. going forward, cimb group chief executive tengku datuk zafrul tengku abdul aziz said 2015 looks challenging and the group is remaining cautious, given the regional economic environment and the moderation in consumer spending in malaysia. we will continue to focus on cost management and operational streamlining, at the same time continue to ensure core operations remain robust, he said. kuala lumpur kepong bhd (klk)s net profit shed 29% to rm222.5 million in the second quarter ended march 31, 2015, from rm314.6 million in the previous corresponding quarter. revenue, however, grew 4.5% to rm3.07 billion, from rm2.93 billion a year ago. klk declared an interim single tier dividend of 15 sen per share for the financial year ending sept 30, 2015. on prospects ahead, klk said the global economy remains uncertain, amid the current low palm oil prices trading in a narrow range of rm2,150 per mt and rm2,250 per mt. the group said its current financial year's plantation profit is expected to be lower than that of the previous financial year. batu kawan bhds net profit declined 26% to rm120.9 million in the second quarter ended mar 31, 2015, from rm163.2 million in the previous corresponding quarter. the groups revenue, however, rose 4.5% to rm3.16 billion, from rm3.02 billion a year ago, as all segments reported higher revenues. the group declared an interim single tier dividend of 15 sen per share for the financial year ending sept 30, 2015. on prospects ahead, batu kawans plantation profit for the current financial year is expected to be lower than last financial years, in view of the prevailing low palm oil prices. deleum bhds net profit fell 15.6% to rm8.2 million in the first quarter ended march 31, 2015, from rm9.8 million in the previous corresponding quarter. revenue however, jumped 34% to rm135.9 million, from rm101.4 million previously. in a statement, deleum (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 2.1) said the lower profit was due to lower contributions from its oilfield services segment and maintenance, repair and overhaul (mro) segment.

weak start to fy2015", "article": " cimb group holdings bhd is likely to have a weak start to the year, if the first quarter financial results of its indonesian and thai banking subsidiaries are any indication. higher levels of provision for bad loans in pt bank cimb niaga tbk and cimb thai bank pcl saw each of them turning in a worse-than-expected performance last week. this will continue to weigh on cimb groups earnings, say analysts. the group had one of its worst quarterly performances in the fourth quarter of last year, mainly because of high provisions. cimb group (fundamental: 1.05; valuation: 1.65) is expected to announce its first quarter results next month. generally, we expected a weak quarter because of cimb niaga, alliancedbs says in a research note. however, the malaysian business should see a better quarter in the absence of goodwill impairment for the investment banking business and a one-off large provision related to a legacy corporate account that was booked in the fourth quarter of 2014 (4q2014), the research house adds. the malaysia operation still accounts for the biggest chunk of cimb groups earnings. indonesia made up 19% of the groups full-year earnings in 2014, but in better years, it used to be about 30%. last wednesday, cimb groups 97.94%-owned indonesian bank, cimb niaga, reported a 92.4% drop in net profit to idr83 billion for the first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1qfy2015). this accounted for just 2% to 3% of analyst consensus estimates for the full year. the dismal performance was mainly due to a 619.4% year-on-year increase in provision expenses, to idr1.45 trillion. the provisions were, nevertheless, lower by 26.2% than that in 4q2014. this helped cimb niagas net profit rise by 80.4% on a quarter-on-quarter basis from a low base of idr46 billion in 4q2014. in an interview with the edge last month, cimb group ceo tengku datuk zafrul aziz indicated that cimb niagas provisions in the first quarter would be lower than in 4q2014. we are hopeful that the second quarter onwards will be better. nobody can foresee the future [but] we can safely say the fourth quarter [of 2014] is the worst, he said. analysts, however, think provisions will remain high in the second quarter too. provision for loan losses are likely to remain elevated in 2q2015 but lower than the preceding two quarters, midf research banking analyst kelvin ong says following a results briefing by cimb niagas management last week. given the weaker economic environment, loan growth slowed to 9.6%, while non-interest income fell by 29.4% because of weaker treasury market activities and lower bancassurance fees. cimb niagas asset quality continued to deteriorate, with the gross non-performing loan (npl) ratio rising to 4.1% compared with 2.57% a year ago, and 3.9% as at end-december 2014. vice-president and director d james rompas blames this on the tougher economic conditions, volatile rupiah and softer commodity prices. nonetheless, some analysts question whether the bank could have fared better if its credit controls in the past had been tighter. about 4% to 5% of cimb niagas total loan book is exposed to the troubled coal and coal-related segments. of these, 40% are classified as non-performing. the coal segment aside, analysts say the banks management is also wary of asset quality in the manufacturing sector. management expects the weak operating environment to persist into 2q2015 and guides for ongoing net interest margin (nim) compression. provisioning levels are expected to remain elevated in 2q2015, but management does not expect the gross npl ratio to breach 5%, maybank investment bank researchs desmond chng says in a note to clients last thursday. while we think that our provisioning assumptions are sufficiently conservative, the operating environment has been weaker than expected. cutting our nim and non-interest income assumptions, we downgrade cimb niagas fy2015 and fy2016 net profit forecasts by 23% and 11% [respectively], with an estimated 6% and 3% impact on cimb groups earnings, he adds. meanwhile, last tuesday, the groups 93.71%-owned thai bank, cimb thai, reported a 70.4% slump in first quarter net profit to thb130.6 million. this accounted for only 15% of analysts full-year forecast. unlike cimb niaga, however, cimb thais contribution to cimb group is small, at less than 3%. cimb thais results are reflective of the still challenging economic environment prevalent in the country, evidenced by the 117.6% year-on-year spike in provisions, says publicinvest research. the provision was 41.9% higher than that in the preceding quarter. cimb thais loan growth was a tepid 2.7%. gross npl worsened to 3.7% from 3.3% as at end-december due to lower repayments from several corporate accounts. just last monday, public bank bhd kicked off the reporting season for the january-march quarter among banks. despite a tougher operating environment, the banking group turned in a 15% rise in net profit to rm1.17 billion, which was within analysts expectations. maybank ib research cut its call on cimb group to sell from hold, but kept its target price at rm5.70 pending the release of its results. according to bloomberg data, most analysts have a hold call on the stock. the stock, which has gained 10.4% this year, closed at rm6.09 last friday.  note: the edge researchs

"}, "473": {"date_posted": "20/5/2015", "title": "the state of the nation: 1mdb hits confidence, compounds ringgit weakness", "article": " the ringgit has gained a much-needed respite as brent crude oil rebounded above us$60 a barrel and straw polls leaned towards the likelihood of a delay in us federal reserves much-discussed interest rate hike. it was also helpful that last wednesdays announcement of bank negara malaysias foreign reserves of us$105.6 billion (rm391.4 billion) as at april 15, showed the possibility of the first month-on-month increase after five straight months of declines wiped out over us$23 billion in value. but there continues to be a lot of negative news out there that is affecting the valuation of the ringgit and also investor sentiment in general in terms of the performance of the stock market, says datuk seri nazir razak, chairman of cimb group that co-hosted this years invest malaysia kuala lumpur with bursa malaysia. i think it is important for all malaysian companies to go out and engage investors and share the investment fundamentals of malaysia, nazir says, calling for more aggressive engagement to win back investor confidence. you also cannot just spin, youve got to deal with the substance of the questions. this could be why nazir chose to voice his disappointment over 1malaysia development bhds (1mdb) refusal to engage investors at invest malaysia. they declined to participate and im disappointed because they would have been an important element of invest malaysia given the backchatter on the topic, he says. controversies surrounding debt-laden government-owned 1mdb is among investors top concerns about malaysia  the reason its absence at invest malaysia is a bugbear  though not surprising to anyone familiar with malaysia. i didnt expect [1mdb] to participate but i would have been happy to be wrong. instead were here whispering and pretending there is no elephant in the room and talking about who is lonely and whos not, one foreign financial executive tells the edge on the sidelines of the invest malaysia conference that took place on april 23 and 24, on the back of fresh exposu00e9s by whistleblower site sarawak report on 1mdb and its links to 34-year-old billionaire investor low taek jho. the silence over the 1mdb elephant-in-the-room was confounded by fresh salvos launched online by former prime minister tun dr mahathir mohamad on his blog against prime minister datuk seri najib razak, questioning the latter over what he sees as some rm27 billion in unaccounted assets on 1mdbs books. yet the show must go on at invest malaysia and nazir says the conference remains a platform to highlight malaysias top companies and the countrys fundamental strengths, which won over investors at a recent us$1.5 billion global islamic debt offering that was hugely oversubscribed and priced better than expected. speaking to reporters on sidelines of the conference, nazir stresses that the issue of 1mdb is one isolated case but is unfortunately a bit of an eyesore that is better earlier solved because people tend to expect the worst when issues are not cleared up. the damage is already showing. bank negaras reserves are at their lowest since november 2010, despite hopes of a turnaround this month. closing at rm3.58 to the us dollar last friday, the ringgit was down 8.67% the past year and is the third worst performing in bloombergs basket of asian currencies after the yen and rupiah, which have weakened 14.38% and 10.21% over the same period respectively. more importantly, while the rupiah and ringgit have both weakened about 10% against the us dollar the past year, bank indonesias foreign reserves are 5.7% higher year on year whereas bank negaras reserves have fallen by nearly a fifth. bank negaras reserves fell to us$105.1 billion as at end-march 2015 from us$131.17 billion as at end-april 2014. indonesias central bank, meanwhile, added about us$6 billion in reserves over the period to us$111.55 billion as at end-march 2015, ceic data shows. rhb research institute executive chairman and chief economist lim chee sing says this is because malaysia suffered more foreign selling in the capital markets than in indonesia on all fronts, be it in equities, malaysian government securities and bank negara malaysia bills. its is no surprise, then, that malaysias bellwether fbm klci performance the past year lagged that of benchmarks in indonesia, singapore, thailand and the philippines. at the same time, malaysian asset management companies, unit trust funds and pension funds are diversifying their investments overseas. in addition, unlike indonesia, malaysia has been a net exporter of productive capital over the last eight consecutive years, lim says, referring to the net outflow of direct investment where the amount foreigners invest in malaysia is less than the amount corporate malaysia is investing abroad. while the net outflow narrowed from rm24.4 billion in 2012 to rm17.1 billion in 2014, he says these investments added to the total outflow of capital from malaysia and is, therefore, a contributing factor to the fall in bank negaras reserves. that the central banks reserves have fallen from us$134.9 billion as at end-2013 to us$105.6 billion as at mid-april 2015 represents a significant erosion of bank negaras reserves, says rajiv biswas, asia-pacific chief economist at ihs global. this partly reflects net portfolio capital outflows on the malaysian balance of payments of rm27.9 billion in 2014 as well as a rm76.5 billion net outflow on the financial account. although bank negara has not been attempting to defend the ringgit against depreciation, nevertheless central banks do operate to maintain the pace of depreciation to try to prevent disorderly exchange rate movements, biswas says. indonesias foreign reserves, meanwhile, increased by us$12.5 billion to us$112 billion as at end-2014, helped by a balance of payments surplus of us$15.2 billion. this was due to a narrowing current account deficit and a doubling in the capital and financial account surplus to us$43.6 billion from increased net inflows of portfolio capital and foreign direct investment, he explains. biswas is quick to add that bank negaras reserves remain substantial and sufficient to cover over six months of imports, which is still very strong by international standards among emerging markets. malaysias external account remains a source of macroeconomic strength, with a long track record of large current account surpluses. even with the lower oil price factored into the 2015 forecast, the malaysian current account is forecast to remain in surplus of around 2% of gross domestic product, strengthening to over 3% of gdp in 2016. with oil prices forecast by ihs to gradually strengthen from 2016 onwards, malaysias current account surplus is expected to improve further over the medium term, biswas adds. chua hak bin, head of emerging asia economics at bank of america merrill lynch disagrees, pointing out that bank negaras reserves cover to import of 6.1 months is lowest in more than a decade. in addition, reserves cover to short-term external debt has fallen below one time. the ringgit will likely come under pressure when liquefied natural gas prices fall more significantly and worsen current account in 2h2015, on top of 1mdb risks and prospects of fed rate hikes, chua says in an april 22 note. foreign reserves have been falling on large capital outflows. foreign reserves declined us$5.4 billion in march to us$105.1 billion, closing in on the us$100 billion psychological threshold. we estimate that bank negara ran down reserves by us$3.8 billion in march to defend the ringgit [with the rest largely due to translation losses]. we also see growing tail-risks given the political developments and 1mdb. a ratings downgrade from fitch is also more likely than not in may/june. on fitch ratings potential downgrade of malaysias sovereign ratings by end-june, nazir says, i think fitch just needs to be engaged and hopefully, they will not downgrade malaysia because as i said, if their concern is what they hear about 1mdb or whatever, it is not systemic. people just need to go into the numbers and see what is the real magnitude of concerns. rhbs lim agrees that it is not all gloom and doom for malaysia, but neither is it just a perception issue. to begin with, malaysias equity market valuations were relatively rich without earnings growth to bring down valuations to a more attractive level. subsequently, we became the only casualty in the region from the rapid drop in oil and gas prices as malaysia is the only net oil and gas exporter in the region. added to these were the 1mdb issue, the risk of an impending sovereign rating downgrade by fitchu2026 given the high foreign holdings of financial assets in the country, malaysia bore the brunt of foreign selling and hence, a sharper-than-expected weakening of the ringgit, he says. still, there are always two sides to a coin and malaysia will be the regions only net beneficiary if oil and gas prices stage a convincing rebound. incidentally, the ringgits close of rm3.58 to the us dollar last friday is its strongest in 10 weeks as brent prices went up to us$65.58 a barrel  the highest since dec 9, 2014. if this lifts the ringgit to a stronger level vis-u00e0-vis the us dollar and corporate earnings start to rebound, the outlook may begin to improve as time progresses, lim says, reminding that corporate malaysia has been investing to build new capacity over the last two to three years. addressing participants at invest malaysia, bank negara governor tan sri zeti akhtar aziz said malaysia has over several decades demonstrated time and again the ability to emerge from commodity price shocks, financial crisis and the spillovers from the disruptions generated from other parts of the world. having made the trip to kuala lumpur, foreign participants havent given up hope on malaysia. but the heightened global uncertainties that are causing large and precipitous movements in global liquidity means malaysia can ill afford to have the 1mdb elephant-in-the-room impact the countrys investability.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on april 27 - may 3, 2015."}, "474": {"date_posted":

a 2.5% growth in non-interest income. geographically, cimb said non-malaysian pre-tax profit contribution to the group was lower at 20% in 1qfy15 compared with 38% in 1qfy14, principally due to the

operations performed better. cimb said its total gross loans (excluding the declining bad bank loan book) expanded 12.8% y-o-y. over the same period, total deposits grew by a similar 12.8% y-o-y, with loan to deposit ratio (ldr) slightly lower at 90.3% compared to 90.7% previously. the groups gross impairment ratio rose to 3.2% as at march 2015 from 3.1% in march 2014, with a higher allowance

the changes and decisions we have taken in line with target 18 plans (t18) are starting to show some results, and we will continue to be single minded and focused on the execution our plans, he added. tengku zafrul noted that cimb singapore continues to perform positively with continued business growth, while cimb thai will likely show operational improvements despite the uncertain macroeconomic

two companies are in the area of brownfield services which requires workbarges and workboats. the research house pointed out that perdana currently has five workbarges and a workboat deployed to dayang on long-term charters. the control of perdana would give dayang better access to perdanas young fleet of 19 vessels, of which 17 are in operation and two are due for delivery in financial year 2016 (fy16), it said. meanwhile, kenanga research noted that it is no secret that dayang intends to take perdana private. this is due to the more compelling valuation of perdana following the crude oil price slump while synergistic benefits can also be achieved with perdanas fleet of vessels complementing dayangs hook-up and commissioning (huc) capabilities. we believe the deal could put dayang in a better position to target a bigger slice of the next round of the pan malaysia huc umbrella contract (possibly worth rm10 billion) expected to be awarded in 2018 to 2019, said kenanga. it added that perdana is likely to be the least exposed offshore support vessel player to renegotiation of rates by petronas as it is already providing relatively low rates compared to its peers given

general meeting (egm) yesterday. cypark in february 2012 received the approval-in-principle from the federal government for the ladang tanah merah project. the project involves the development of a sanitary landfill along with the required infrastructure, besides a waste segregation facility and renewable energy plant. daud deems the internal rate of return for the project as reasonable, but declined to provide the exact figure or any other indicative financial details of the project, citing confidentiality as a reason. as for the tipping fees for the collection of municipal solid waste

exceed 1,000 tonnes per day. moving forward, daud said cypark is in favour of entering into concession contracts as they provide recurring income to the group. we tend to focus more on this kind of build-operate-transfer concession contracts, rather than short-term contracts, he said. for the first financial quarter ended jan 31, 2015 (1qfy15), cypark posted a 10.4% increase in net profit to

and they touched as low as rm2,082 per tonne at the end of last month. the export levies were reportedly imposed to fund indonesias recently announced biodiesel subsidies and it could help to underpin palm oil prices if biodiesel demand picks up. in a statement yesterday, minister of plantation industry and commodities datuk amar douglas uggah embas said the government is closely monitoring the situation and analysing any possible impact of indonesias export levies on the malaysian palm oil industry. he said a task force was formed to discuss and recommend policy options to the government. cimb researchs analyst ivy ng lee fang told the edge financial daily that the research house was not surprised by the news as the market had been anticipating the implementation of the levies since early april. details on the new regulations like whether all or selected processed palm oil products will be taxed remain unclear, she said. ng pointed that the export levies will not go down well with indonesian plantation owners because the tax will result in refiners squeezing the planters for lower prices. however, this could be offset by medium-term gains from higher cpo prices if the move boosts biodiesel usage significantly, she said. an analyst explained that the impact on companies like sime darby (fundamental: 1.0; valuation: 1.1) and klk (fundamental: 1.0; valuation: 0.5) would not be significant as both have exposure of merely 30% to 40%. kenanga research analyst voon yee ping said the new policy would reduce export volume from indonesia, thus benefiting malaysian palm oil producers. there will be restricted supply in the market in the short to medium term, she said. a public-listed cpo players executive said his management team understood that the new policy was

late, has been urged to be more focused and prudent in its merger and acquisition (m&a) activities, in addition to continuously improving its operational efficiency. fgvs (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 1.4) share price has plunged by 53.85% from its offer price of rm4.55 in its initial public offering (ipo) in 2012. earnings have also been on the decline due to various factors, including low commodity prices, primarily crude palm oil (cpo), of which fgv said it is the worlds largest producer. two weeks ago, petaling jaya utara member of parliament tony pua raised concerns that felda settlers lost an estimated rm177 million due to the drastic drop in fgvs share price. the cpo price has been trending lower since mid-2012. for fgv, the low price environment was exacerbated by low fresh fruit bunch yield and oil extraction rates due to the high percentage (43%) of old trees and operational inefficiencies.  cimb research plantations analyst ivy ng said, historically, fgvs performance has been weak compared with its peers, hence the group should continue to increase efficiency to improve its earnings prospects.  the cpo price is beyond the companys control. at the end of the day, as a commodities player, it has to strive to be among the most efficient at the estate level to be competitive in this industry, ng said.  cpo futures have fallen 18.85% over the last year, to last fridays close of rm2,148 per tonne. the slump in cpo prices last year was brought about by higher-than-expected production of soyoil, which led to narrower price margins between cpo and soyoil. demand for cpo has also fallen from major importers such as china and india. on fgvs operations, ng noted that it would take time for it to improve its efficiency at the estate level and reduce cost of production.  this is not something new, and every company should be embarking on this continuously, she said.  on the drastic drop in fgvs share price, she said it was affected by various factors, including the weaker net profit and that several major shareholders have been disposing of their shares. for its financial year ended december 2014, fgvs net profit plunged 68.81% to rm306.37 million from rm982.25 million the year before. this is despite revenue strengthening by 30.76% to rm16.434 billion from rm12.568 billion. cimb research has a reduce call on fgv, with a target price of rm2.30. ng was also negative on fgvs acquisition of asian plantations ltd (apl) last year, saying in a report last august that the acquisition was expensive for a loss-making entity. according to bloomberg, apl posted a net loss of around rm101 million for the 10 months to oct 31, 2014. the acquisition was completed in october. other analysts have expressed concern about fgvs m&a activities, with some saying the group should acquire companies with positive earnings to improve its own prospects. fgv should be more focused when committing to m&a, an analyst told the edge financial daily, as she noted the group is too ambitious in expanding its footprint in all the business segments it is involved in. she said the agri-business giant should focus on developing its upstream plantation business by acquiring brownfield oil palm plantations as these will contribute immediately to the group.  the group should spend the remaining ipo proceeds prudently, she said. according to fgvs latest financial statement, it has utilised rm4.012 billion of the proceeds from the ipo, leaving rm446.33 million as at dec 31, 2014. of the balance, it said rm183.116 million would be allocated for the acquisition of plantation assets, rm242.544 million for the construction or acquisition of mills and refineries, with the remaining rm20.67 million set aside for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes. another analyst noted fgv has been actively replanting to improve the age profile of its trees. it plans to replant some 15,000ha a year within the next three years.  however, he said it would take time to see the results. so you have to hold the stock for at least another three years, he said. thus, the most immediate way to boost its earnings was to acquire other companies, he said. another analyst with a local bank said fgvs main challenge now should be to restore investor confidence by raising profitability in its core segments. i think operationally there are still a number of things they can do, like management has mentioned how it will keep trying to bring down production costs, he said.fgvs downstream refining and crushing segments are probably looking at reaching the necessary volumes, as those businesses have proved that they can be profitable for other players. at press time, attempts to get comments from fgv proved unsuccessful. the stock closed unchanged at rm2.10 last friday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm7.624 billion.  the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and

restructuring and rights issue, the dilutive effect on earnings per share (eps)  expected to range between 10% and 30%  weighed on its share price yesterday. rhbcaps share price fell as much as 3.05% or 25 sen to rm7.95 before closing at rm7.96, with 1.65 million shares done yesterday. this translated into a market capitalisation of rm20.48 billion. rhbcap (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 2.1) proposed on monday an internal reorganisation that will see rhb bank bhd take over its parents listing status. the group has also proposed a rights issue of new shares to raise up to rm2.5 billion for its working capital and to meet the requirements of basel iii.  in a note yesterday, cimb research analyst winson ng estimated that the rights issue will dilute the groups eps by 10% to 12% for the financial year ending dec 31, 2016 (fy16). however, he said the dilution will be partly offset by tax savings and the withdrawal of the holding-company discount for the valuation of the stock. the swap ratio of rhbcap and rhb bank shares has yet to be determined at this juncture, but we think that investors exposure to rhbcaps business profile will not materially change following the exercise, though all of its business units will be housed under the newly listed entity of rhb bank, he said. meanwhile, maybank investment bank research analyst desmond chng said the positives of the exercise include an enhanced common equity tier 1 (cet1) ratio of 11% at group level, reduced goodwill from rm5.2 billion to rm3 billion, and improved return on equity (roe) from about 10.2% to 11.2% for fy16. he said the exercise would eliminate the groups double leverage problem, reduce interest costs and uplift earnings of about rm120 million per annum. on the flip side, we estimate a 29% dilution of fy16 eps as a result of this exercise, he said in his note yesterday. meanwhile, hong leong investment bank research analyst low yee huap expects the eps dilution to be about 30% but said there is a potential roe enhancement of 186 basis points following the completion of the proposals. he is positive about the proposed exercise despite the eps dilution as it would enhance profitability and roe on top of addressing capital issues and inefficiency of the group structure. the higher roe and bank holding structure suggest that the new rhb bank entity could garner higher valuation and benefit shareholders, he added. alliancedbs analyst lynette cheng said while rhbcaps corporate exercise is positive for the group, the research firm is mindful of the malaysian banking sector remaining challenging in 2015 with moderate loan growth. she said the banking sectors net interest margin is expected to be pressured by higher funding cost as capital market slows. she also cited higher credit and operating costs due to the goods and services tax as challenges affecting the banking sector. cheng estimated that the entire corporate exercise would diluteepsby around 10% but would be roe accretive (by 1.6 percentage points) because of higher earnings from interest cost-savings and a smaller equity base because of lower goodwill. most analysts have maintained their earnings forecasts, target prices and ratings on rhbcap, pending more details. maybank ib research, however, changed its call on rhbcap from buy to hold. on monday, rhbcap group managing director kellee kam said the restructuring would see the group move towards a bank holding company structure in line with major regional banking groups acrossasean. the move would also give rhbcap better capital and tax efficiency for profit growth. the proposals are expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2015. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet

beneficiaries of the goods and services tax (gst), expects to sustain its strong growth momentum in 2015, driven by the launch of new cloud-based solutions for small and medium enterprises (smes), and high growth from the china market. there is still a huge potential for us to grow our recurring income as we launch our software as a service (saas) in june, which is designed specifically for the smes, ifca chief executive officer ken yong keang cheun told the edge financial daily in an interview. saas allows smaller property companies to rent ifcas (fundamental: 3; valuation: 1.1) software. smes can subscribe to our software services by paying a monthly subscription fee of rm4,000 to rm5,000 instead of forking out hundreds of thousands of ringgit upfront, said yong. the business software solutions provider, which is seeking to transfer its listing from the ace market of bursa malaysia to the main market by year end, posted a 1,119.7% surge in net profit to rm21.07 million for the financial year ended dec 31, 2014 (fy14), from rm1.73 million in fy13, mainly due to the scalable nature of the software business. revenue for fy14 rose 71.59% to rm89.24 million from rm52 million. ifca is the countrys largest maker of cloud-based software for property companies, with around 80% market share of the domestic property sector. it serves major property developers including s p setia bhd (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 1.4), mah sing group bhd (fundamental: 2; valuation: 2.4) and eco world development group bhd (fundamental: 0.5; valuation: 0.3). with the implementation of the gst on april 1, which forces smaller companies to computerise and upgrade their software, yong believed its a very good time for ifca to launch saas. the group will launch four saas products this year, covering business accounting solutions for contracting business, standard operating procedures, marketing and contract management. yong said ifca will not restrict itself to the property industry but will expand its services in the information technology, construction and engineering sectors. this year, ifca is also banking on growth from its china market. it is business as usual in china. our existing business is growing there and we plan to open eight to 10 offices in china this year, he said. yong expects the china market to grow significantly this year, leveraging on its reputation and proven products. it accounted for 30% of the groups revenue in fy14. its very competitive in china, but if you can provide the best product, people will buy from you, he said.  ifcas clients in china include big names like the wanda and r&f groups, and country garden holdings co ltd. other regional clients include japans mitsui fudosan co ltd and singapores capitaland ltd.  some may think ifcas recent share price rally and stellar financial performance ride mainly on the gst theme, but yong said the good results it recorded in fy14 were not solely from gst software upgrade jobs, which only contributed 20% to its revenue in fy14. our new software and cloud-based products targeted at bigger property players like s p setia, eco world and sunway bhd (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 1.8) had helped boost our profitability, he said. yong conceded, however, that ifca, together with other software and technology companies, have benefited from the gst imposition. the implementation of the gst actually triggered the trend of computerisation. it makes computerisation a must for all companies as they have to prepare reports to the customs now, he said. the group, with a market capitalisation of rm759.38 million, has caught the attention of institutional investors, which currently hold a combined 20% stake. yong said he will be participating in roadshows to further promote ifca to fund managers in hong kong and singapore. as at jan 23, yong has a direct interest of 0.51% and an indirect interest of 42.48% in ifca, according to bursa malaysia. some believe the gst theme would end two quarters later when companies finish their upgrades, and that the current share price of the gst-related stocks is not sustainable, but cimb research senior analyst nigel foo said ifca may be the exception. ifca has its contribution from china and it will still benefit from the migration from the windows platform to a mobile-based platform. saas and its plan to transfer to the main market are the potential catalysts, he added. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score

malaysian drug globally", "article": "  kuala lumpur: ipoh-based hovid bhd may soon be the first malaysian company with a pharmaceutical product that can be marketed globally, if one of its products  touted as one that can reduce the risk of a mini stroke  passes the us food and drug administrations trials this year, according to the companys managing director and chief executive officer david ho sue san. ho said about one in three people who suffer from a transient ischemic attack (tia), also known as mini-stroke, will eventually have a major episode  with half of them occurring within a year after the first tia. the studies on our drug should finish this year and if that proves to be positive, our company will initiate an ind (investigational new drug) filing. that would make it the first malaysian pharma product in the world, said ho, but did not reveal a specific time frame for that. the product, named tocovid suprabio, contains a compound extracted from palm oil named tocotrienol, a little known but potent part of the vitamin e family which ho claims can protect brain cells and prevent risks of stroke. tocovid suprabio has been sold locally as a health supplement for 15 years, for which hovid is increasingly known for, besides its ho yan hor herbal tea. the company is also studying the effects of the drug on diabetic patients to see whether it can slow down the risk of diabetic neuropathy, said ho. diabetic neuropathy is nerve damage which occurs in individuals as a result of diabetes, which damages nerve fibres throughout the body. while that is ongoing, business-wise, ho said hovid (fundamental 2.1; valuation 1.2) will be focusing on three key initiatives this year, namely improve its manufacturing facilities in ipoh, set up a research and development (r&d) facility in penang, and establish a centralised logistic warehouse in perak. chief financial officer andrew goh said the three initiatives  to cost some rm70 million  will be mostly financed by borrowings (80%), while the remainder (20%) will be borne by internally generated funds. ho said the improvement of its manufacturing facilities in ipoh will be split into two phases where the company will focus on improving its physical packaging in the first phase and its capsule facility in the second. he said the improvement will double hovids existing production capacity and aid in exports where higher manufacturing standards are required. ho estimates the improvements to be concluded by this year. he estimates a contribution of 20%-30% to its top and bottom line from its improved manufacturing facilities for the companys next financial year. for the financial year ended june 30, 2014 (fy14), hovid reported a net profit of rm18 million, down 11% from rm20.33 it saw in the previous year  due to higher operational expenses and unscheduled repairs and maintenance and lower sales mix margin  even though its revenue rose 6% to rm183.54 million from rm172.51 million. on the companys r&d facility, ho said the new facility will help the company conduct more clinical trials and bio-equivalent studies on its existing products. ho explains that in laymen terms bio-equivalence equates to the rate of absorption when compared to a certified drug. the new facility will help us conduct clinical trials as it is equipped with hospital beds and staff. this will give us faster development time for our products. on the companys centralised logistic warehouse, ho said the fully automated facility will help the company reduce wastage of inventory and streamline its distribution. being an exporter of pharmaceutical products to over 50 countries, the company is also a beneficiary of the weakening ringgit. about 60% of its business come from exports while the remainder is made up by local customers. cimbs pharmaceutical analyst saw xiao jun said in his note to clients dated march 26 that he expects hovids new capacity for its ipoh facility to be operational by the middle of this year. the first phase of its new tablet and capsule plant is on track to commence operations by mid-2015, and may take 4-5 months to ramp up production. the second phase of the same plant is expected to start by early-2016, said saw in his note. hovid shares closed at 49.5 sen last friday, up 2.5 sen or 5.32%, with a market capitalisation of rm362.86 million.

silverlake (fundamental: 3; valuation: 2.1) was founded by malaysian goh peng ooi and is a provider of digital economy solutions and services for its clients in the banking, insurance, payment, retail and logistics industries. he said the group has been ahead of competitors in what he calls the flow of time wherein companies evolve from being technology-based to information-based, followed by capability and subsequently intelligence. right from the start our end point is intelligence. we have worked on it for 27 years. we have a winning formula, im not surprised if the group quantum leaps again, goh, the group executive chairman of silverlake, said in an exclusive interview. silverlake is a leading software provider to the banking sector in malaysia, singapore, indonesia, thailand, the philippines and vietnam. in fact, he does not discount the group penetrating europe and the united states at some point in the future. last december, silverlake acquired finzsoft solutions ltd, a software development company based in new zealand and listed on the new zealand stock exchange. there are strong synergies between silverlake and finzsofts products and solutions, and a natural alignment of target customers in the asia-pacific region being tier-1 banks, said dr raymond kwong, silverlake chief executive officer and group managing director. finzsoft had last year fully acquired sush mobile, which develops end-to-end mobile solutions, and specialising in applications for businesses primarily in the enterprise space. kwong does not discount any future acquisitions with good recurring income, which could add value to its customers digital economy businesses. note that silverlake was in a net cash position of rm334.3 million as at dec 31 last year, after deducting borrowings of rm3.16 million. from 2010 to 2014, silverlake made acquisitions to broaden its suite of software solutions and service offerings. during the same period, it registered a compound annual growth rate (cagr) of close to 30% for its revenue and 40% for its net profit. over the medium to long term, kwong said silverlakes earnings will grow at the mid-teens level  in line with revenue growth. for the first half of financial year 2015 ended december 2014 (1hfy15), silverlake registered slower revenue growth although profit rose at a faster pace and margins expanded. but this raised concerns among analysts of the lack of major sizeable order wins that may limit future earnings growth. but the software giant is unperturbed, and is determined to continue its focus on its two main business segments  software licensing, and maintenance and enhancement services  which rake in higher margins. silverlakes business is based on quality recurring income. during 1hfy15, we had a better mix of higher margin revenues which resulted in higher profit growth over revenue. we will continue to focus on growing the higher quality earnings segments of our business, kwong said. for 1hfy15, software licensing as well as maintenance and enhancement services were the only segments that reported an increase in revenue  of 26% and 21%, respectively. the former accounted for 30%

services, sale of software and hardware products, credit and cards processing, and insurance processing  all of which saw a drop in revenue. these four segments accounted for 19% of group revenue in 1hfy15. for 1hfy15, net profit grew 18% to rm131.3 million while revenue rose 6% to rm240.9 million. as a result, gross profit margin improved to 66% from 60%, while net profit margin rose to 58%,

to fy17 seem decent. it maintained a buy on the counter with a target price of s$1.66. given the jumpy nature of orders, it would not be surprising to see marginal volatility in revenue year-on-year. however, beyond the short-term order book fluctuations, silverlakes backlog of orders and its stable business model would allow the group to steer through revenue volatility, said analyst bennett lee. meanwhile, maybank kim eng is of the view that silverlake will benefit from the weakening ringgit, as it generates revenue largely in singapore dollars and us dollars while costs are mainly denominated in ringgit. the research house maintained its buy call on the stock with a target price of s$1.40. silverlake closed at s$1.36 last friday, giving it a market capitalisation of s$3.042

although its share price had rallied 34% from late january, poor quarterly earnings announced last week sparked a sell-off, wiping out some 38% of that gain in just one day. the counter fell a sharp 13% to close at rm2.56 last wednesday, a day after the agri-business giant announced its results for its financial year ended dec 31, 2014 (fy2014). it now stands at just over 56% of its initial public offering (ipo) price of rm4.55. while shareholders who had bought into its ipo in mid-2012 would not have much to shout about, could the present low price indicate a buying opportunity? granted, there have been grumblings from some quarters about the lacklustre performance of fgv (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 0.6) on the stock market. while the company has problems and legacy issues to deal with, it also has 450,000ha of plantation land  one of the largest in the world  not including the almost 500,000ha leased from the federal land development authority. to be fair, fgv timed its listing right at the apex of the crude palm oil (cpo) price boom in mid-2012. however, cpo took a downward turn and is today trading below rm2,300 per tonne compared with almost rm3,600 per tonne at the time fgv was listed. this means that the valuation of plantation companies across the board is at quite a big discount at this point in time. if you are taking a long-term view, then yes, this would be a good price point to buy into fgv. but you must be prepared to hold the stock for at least three to five years, says an analyst with a local research house. thats how long it would take for its replanting efforts to kick in. since its listing, fgv has been actively replanting its estates to spruce up its old-age profile  about 50% of its palm trees are more than 18 years old. the groups replanting target is 15,000ha a year and last year, it spent rm327 million on replanting, according to a cimb research report. if cpo prices head towards an up cycle just as fgvs new plantings come onstream in a few years, then it would be a star performer, another analyst notes. the analyst community has so far forecast cpo to average between rm2,100 and rm2,650 per tonne this year compared with 2014s average of rm2,400 per tonne. midf research, which has one of the higher projections, expects to adjust its rm2,650 forecast downwards. beyond this year, analysts expect cpo to perk up and rise above rm2,600 per tonne by 2017. but even if fgvs young palm trees begin producing as cpo prices increase, an analyst notes that this would still be in a small portion of its landbank. based on fgvs 15,000ha replanting target since its listing, this portion would make up barely 4% of the total landbank under its management. fgvs upstream performance hinges on cpo prices, so it will tend to see a lot of volatility in earnings. the present cpo market is not a good one but in an up market, fgv could be a darling, says an analyst with a local bank-backed research house. he adds, however, that investors should also look at fgvs cost of production, which could eat into its bottom line even if cpo prices are strong. another swing factor for the group when taking a long-term view is the profitability of its downstream division. in fy2014, this segment posted a loss before tax of rm125.2 million  more than double its loss of rm52.5 million in fy2013  dragging down overall earnings. the group attributed the decline to lower margins from its soy and canola crushing unit in canada as well as negative margins from its refining operations in malaysia. it is difficult to take a long-term stance on fgv because its downstream operations are still variable in terms of future performance, says the analyst with the bank-backed research house. other crushing players in america seem to be getting good prices, but not fgv. to be fair, it could be a one-off stroke of bad luck because of cold weather last year, which crimped production. but this is not something we can be sure of in the long term and fgv has to prove itself first. fgvs upstream segment also took a beating in fy2014, slipping 39% to rm704.6 million from rm1.16 billion the year before. overall, the groups results came in below expectations with its fourth quarter net profit falling 96% year on year to rm20.2 million. this brought full-year net profit to rm306.4 million, down 68.8% y-o-y. fgvs bottom line was squeezed even though it saw revenue grow 16% y-o-y to rm4.3 billion in 4qfy2014, bringing its full-year revenue to rm16.4 billion, up 30.7% from the year before. as a result, many analysts have downgraded the stock post the results (see table). in fact, the edge researchs scores for the company have declined from a month ago. where its fundamental score was 2.1, it is now 1.55 while its valuation score has fallen to 0.6 from 2.4. the valuation score reflects the decline in both fgvs share price and earnings to date. its net asset value per share has also dropped to 1.74 sen from 1.8 sen the year before. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if

ka-shing last month to separate his businesses into two distinct listed (property and non-property) entities  creating shareholder value through the elimination of holding company discount  has set financial markets abuzz. while such a move is not considered groundbreaking, it reportedly got asian conglomerates looking at whether they could do the same with their businesses. among the listed companies on bursa malaysia, several could unlock value through a reorganisation of their businesses for a more efficient structure. one of the reasons li ka-shing restructured and demerged the cheung kong and hutchison whampoa groups is because a lot of the values are trapped. when the assets are at the bottom, investors always give discounts on the value of the group itself, says astramina advisory sdn bhd managing director wong muh rong. by flipping the assets to the holding group and swapping the shares, he actually guides the investors and shareholders that the values of the stocks should be at that particular level. the move by li, 86, has addedus$2.5 billionto the combined market value of cheung kong (holdings) ltd and its 52.45% subsidiary hutchison whampoa ltd. the li ka-shing unity trust owns 39.43% of cheung kong. under the reorganisation, the real estate assets held by cheung kong and hutchison whampoa will be folded into cheung kong property holdings, possibly making it hong kongs largest listed property company. the more internationally focused and non-property assets, which include ports, retail, energy and telecommunications, will be listed as ck hutchison holdings. the reorganisation is aimed at removing the 23% discount that cheung kong trades at compared with its book value, which includes its holdings in hutchison, the company said. both have joint stakes in chinese real estate assets, as well as hotels in hong kong and china. a number of listed entities on bursa, such as ytl corp bhd, genting bhd and berjaya corp bhd, are investment holding companies without a core business of their own. instead, the businesses are held by their subsidiaries, grouped either by type of business or geography. usually, investment holding companies do not reflect the sum-of-parts value of their holdings in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associate companies, says areca capital sdn bhd chief executive danny wong. in most cases, when there is a holding company, it is usually traded at a discount, he says, adding that this is because the holding company is rarely a takeover target.  furthermore, in valuing the holding company, it takes into account the values of the individual businesses, and not all the businesses will do well. so, those that are not doing well will drag down the value of the group, he adds.  holding companies are usually at a discount because of investors perception of them  rojak. but such companies have their advantages u2026 they are big caps  meaning more liquidity, better earnings stability and lower risk [because of the various businesses]. by right, they deserve a premium, says phillip capital management sdn bhd chief investment officer ang kok heng. some investors argue that the structure whereby a holding company holds shares in multiple subsidiaries through a two-tier, or more, shareholding level is not efficient, as the value of the assets at the bottom is not likely to be fully appreciated by the market. however, some corporate advisers note that this conglomerate structure, whereby a holding company holds shares in several other listed and privately held firms, exists because the major shareholders want to maintain control of the groups vast businesses. such a structure is more prevalent in family-owned businesses, as the holding company will be where the founding family oversees and exercises management control over subsidiaries and associate companies. what ytl did was in a manner for the family structure; it is not so much about realising trapped values. it is for them to hold all the family members together, by holding the investments at ytl corp. then, they control from there, says muh rong. whether a holding company structure is efficient or not, it depends on what the owner thinks and wants. if the owner wants to maintain control in the sense of wrapping the entire group, it will be through an investment holding company. but, for investors, is it the best to have a structure like that? not necessarily. for investors, no one is stopping them from investing directly. if they dont like the holding company, they can always invest in the subsidiaries. despite the fact that ytl corp (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 1.2) trades at a lower price-to-earnings multiple compared with some of its bursa-listed subsidiaries, the yeoh family is seen as being comfortable with the groups structure as the profits from these companies still flow back to the top. ytl group comprises bursa-listed ytl power international bhd, ytl land & development bhd, ytl e-solutions bhd and ytl hospitality real estate investment trust (reit) and singapore-listed starhill global reit. ytl power (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 2.4) operates power plants and treats waste water, besides owning ytl communications sdn bhd, which is the 4g mobile telecommunications operator. ytl land (fundamental: 0.7; valuation: 0.9) is a property development company and ytl reit (fundamental: 0.15; valuation: 3) manages the groups hospitality properties. as at feb 16, ytl corp was traded at 14 times its historical earnings per share, while ytl land and ytl e-solutions were valued at 30.6 times and 20.8 times respectively. in a report dated feb 13, cimb research ascribed a 20% discount to ytl corps revalued net asset value (rnav) of rm2.92 per share, giving it a fair value of rm2.34. while investors can always choose to bet on either ytl corp or any of its listed subsidiaries, for instance, they have no choice when it comes to investing in malaysian resources corp bhd (mrcb). this is because the group is the only listed entity, holding all the property development assets and construction and concession businesses. in a report dated dec 16, 2014, rhb research institute values the rnav of mrcb (fundamental: 0.45; valuation: 0.6) at rm2 per share. the group was trading at rm1.42 last tuesday, a discount of almost 30% to its rnav. the emergence of conglomerates the conglomerate corporate structure came in vogue in the 1990s in asia. the decade saw the emergence of big conglomerates in major asian economies, ranging from state-owned enterprises to family-owned groups. also, as a corporation grows, it usually embarks on an expansion drive through mergers and acquisitions. often these corporations end up having multiple businesses, which could be grouped under a separate stand-alone entity.  the growth will come to a point where the corporation has become too big with multiple core businesses.shareholders would soon realise that investors are not rewarding the group for the high-growth areas that they have invested in. when a conglomerate comes to a situation like that, they will start to think of ways to unlock the values of their businesses. there are two ways to do that: by injecting assets into another public-listed company to get shares in that company, and by asset disposals, says muh rong. the 1998 asian financial crisis proved to be the undoing of some of the conglomerates that grew too fast. the rapid expansion of these corporations involved debt accumulation, which proved to be unsustainable. the rapid depreciation of the baht, won, ringgit and rupiah led to prominent conglomerates being broken up as they struggled under the weight of mounting foreign currency debt. in malaysia, the restructuring of the renong-uem group and the listing of mrcbs media businesses are some of the examples of conglomerates being restructured to pare down debts. the disposal of multi-purpose holdings bhds (mphb) associate stake in sarawak enterprise (now sarawak energy bhd) was to unlock value. conglomerates seem to be less favoured by investors today compared with the 1990s. one of the after-effects of the asian financial crisis is that investors are quite averse to conglomerate structures and are keener to invest in groups with two or three focused businesses. this is because while it is easier for conglomerates to raise funds, their sheer size and multiple core businesses make them very difficult for the top management to focus sometimes, says danny. i am among those who like stand-alone businesses more than conglomerates. first, the structure is better because each of the businesses will have a better view of debt-to-equity ratio. there could also be a different dividend policy, he says. companies with capital-intensive businesses may pay lower dividends compared with those with more mature businesses, as they will have to reserve cash for reinvestments. investing in stand-alone businesses allows the investor to choose the kind of dividend payout ratio that he is comfortable with. if i am investing in a conglomerate, the dividend policy would have to consider the capital requirements of all its businesses, danny explains. in recent years, some major shareholders of listed corporations in malaysia have undertaken restructuring to unlock value within the group. in the past, there had been several such restructurings, thus benefiting shareholders. the more prominent ones include the relisting of ioi properties group bhd by ioi corp bhd, the demerger of mphb into magnum bhd and mphb capital bhd, and the demerger of telekom malaysia bhd (see corporate exercises  boon or bane for investors?). the demerger of the gaming and financial service businesses of mphb also unlocked the values of the property assets owned by both groups, which was almost similar to the case of the restructuring of the cheung kong-hutchison whampoa group. ioi corps (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 2.1) listing of its property development business has also unlocked values and separates the growth needs of that arm from those of the plantation business. berjaya corp (fundamental: 0.35; valuation: 1.2) has over the last few years undertaken a few rounds of successful listing of its food, retail and motor businesses, making the major shareholder many times richer. for instance, the listing of berjaya auto bhd has increased the value of berjaya corps 67.6% stake in the business by at least four times. conglomerate sime darby bhd is now working on the listing of its automotive arm this year to unlock value for its shareholders. sime darby motors distributes bmw cars in hong kong, china, vietnam and australia. this could be followed by the listing of its indonesian plantation assets. it is worth noting that sime darby (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.3) is the result of the synergy drive mega merger of nine plantation and property companies owned by permodalan nasional bhd. the enlarged sime darby was relisted on bursa in 2007.  the merger was initially seen as beneficial to shareholders of the companies involved, including the original sime darby, golden hope plantations bhd and guthrie bhd, as a bigger conglomerate would be able to expand its businesses more rapidly. however, sime darbys shares have been trading at less than rm10 over the last six years. from the relisting on nov 27, 2007, to last tuesday, the share price of sime darby has depreciated 12.9%, supporting the argument that the mega merger has failed to create value for its shareholders. nevertheless, an investor who had bought sime darby shares in early 2007, before the mega merger, would still be better off  making a capital gain of at least 50% on the original investment  if he had held on to his shares up to last tuesday. corporate advisers believe that the owners and top management of conglomerates know what they want and have strategies to achieve their internal objectives. restructuring should be done for the right reasons. i am sure there are always values to be unlocked in a conglomerate, but it all boils down to the strategy of the management. we can make a lot of assumptions, but the management knows better what it wants to do. for example, if sime darby were to list any of its businesses, it should be done so that it is easier for the individual businesses to raise funds for future expansion, says kenny yee, head of research of bimb securities. although conglomerates are less favoured these days, muh rong believes that there could come a time when the diversified group structure is back as the darling of investors. this is when groups can prove to investors that they can undertake big projects more efficiently than smaller stand-alone companies, she says. when the market realises that diversified groups can do big deals in an efficient manner, then the market will start paying premium on the stocks. they need to be big but do smart deals, deals that bring value to their shareholders. if they can do that, investors will trust their judgements, she adds.  note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength,

those with downstream exposure, the sectors latest reporting season is likely to disappoint. while this is largely anticipated, the outlook for the sector is looking dim as well. in their financials for the quarter ended dec 31, 2014, plantation giants ioi corp bhd and kuala lumpur kepong bhd showed margin compression due mainly to lower average selling prices. crude palm oil (cpo) prices lost as much as 33% last year to close at rm1,929 per tonne at the end of august from rm2,885 in march, bringing the average price for 2014 to about rm2,400 per tonne. early this month, however, the commodity recovered some 9% to rm2,300 per tonne. prices never quite got the much-needed boost last year from a potential el niu00f1o, which would have curtailed production. in its second quarter ended dec 31, 2014, ioi corp (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 2.1) saw net profit tumble 96% to rm19.6 million from a year ago on the back of a slight decrease in revenue to rm2.88 billion from rm2.94 billion previously. klks (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 0.7) net profit for the quarter dipped as well  to rm214.2 million from rm292.68 million the year before  although revenue rose to rm3.1 billion from rm2.49 billion in 2013. plantation [pre-tax] profit dropped 5.7% [year on year] to rm242.1 million due mainly to the weaker selling prices of cpo and rubber, reduced crop production of both fresh fruit bunches (ffb) and rubber, and higher production cost of cpo, klk says in a filing with bursa malaysia. its average selling price for cpo fell 6.8% year on year to rm2,138 per tonne while that of ioi corp contracted 9.7% to rm2,187. ioi corp said its plantation profit decreased 4% y-o-y to rm297.3 million during the quarter, due mainly to lower cpo and palm kernel oil prices. its downstream segment was also hit hard, declining 19% y-o-y to rm215 million on lower margins from the oleochemical subsector. the company also saw huge foreign exchange translation losses of rm274 million mainly from us dollar denominated debt. this pattern will follow across the board this reporting season for all plantation counters exposed to downstream operations and us dollar denominated debt because of the way the ringgit has depreciated against the us dollar, says an analyst with an international banking institution. note that unrealised forex translation losses are not actual cash transactions but are reflected in the profit and loss account as a result of fluctuating currencies, like in ioi corps case. the downstream players will be worst hit because their inventories must be marked-to-market and this will reflect lower cpo prices, says the analyst. but this is not to say the upstream players are insulated. they too suffer a direct impact from cpo price changes. maybank investment bank research points out in a feb 13 report that while zero cpo export duty has benefited the upstream players (with no export taxes), it has been a bane for refiners in the region that are suffering from overcapacity. malaysia has 58 operating refineries worth rm2.9 billion, according to the palm oil refiners association of malaysia (poram). the biggest refiners include ioi corp, felda global ventures holdings bhd, mewah international inc and wilmar international ltd. as it is, many refiners in malaysia have been in negative margin territory for almost half a year now, says poram chief executive mohammad jaaffar ahmad. this is because the government decided to suspend export duty on cpo in september 2014. following the slight recovery in cpo prices early this month, the market was expecting the tax to resume in march. but the government has since announced that march will remain duty free as the average price has yet to exceed the rm2,250 threshold. for as long as there is no export tax on cpo, refiners will generally suffer negative margins as the price differential between refined palm oil and cpo is currently insufficient to cover costs. as long as the price of cpo is below the threshold price of rm2,250, there should be zero cpo export tax, jaaffar tells the edge. based on the current price trend, futures market, stock levels, market demand and stock levels in importing countries, plus parameters beyond our control, such as the overhanging high production and stock of other vegetable oils and depressed crude oil prices, we see the price of cpo subdued in the first quarter of 2015. this will be reflected in the next reporting season, he adds. jaafar is not the only one forecasting lacklustre prices. we forecast cpo prices to average rm2,100 in 2015 after taking into account the weaker ringgit, says insider asia. we expect single-digit earnings contraction for the sector as a whole this year with output growth partially offsetting the price decline. this seems to be at the lower end of expectations with some analysts keeping cpo price forecasts as high as rm2,650. im waiting for the indonesian biodiesel mandate to be confirmed and planting intentions of the us at the end of march before adjusting the price forecast. it is still too early to tell, says an analyst. the indonesian government recently raised its subsidy for biodiesel to idr4,000 per litre from idr1,500 to support biodiesel usage amidst the decline in crude oil prices. crude oil prices have more than halved since august 2014, making biodiesel blends less competitive in contrast. if the government has strong willpower, then the economics of crude oil to biodiesel blending may not be as important a factor as cpo prices, cimb research analyst ivy ng says. but she notes that at the present crude oil prices, subsidies are required to keep biodiesel in demand. despite the expectation of slightly lower production in malaysia on the back of floods in december, palm oil stocks came in at 2.015 million tonnes in 2014 compared with 1.987 million tonnes in 2013. that said, forecasters are expecting inventory levels to come off this year  conventionally, a boon for prices. but one must take into account the bumper soybean crop in the us, which was estimated at 4 billion bushels last year. that is forecast to grow 11% this year, says the analyst with the international bank. all things considered, it is not easy to see light at the end of the tunnel for the plantation sector.  note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet

"510": {"date_posted": "17/3/2015", "title": "mbsb focuses on next phase of growth", "article": " an aborted merger behind it, non-bank lender malaysia building society bhd (mbsb) is now fully focused on carrying out its five-year business plan that charts its next phase of growth amid a tougher operating environment. the 2015-2019 business plan, which mbsbs (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 2.4) board approved two weeks ago, includes moves to trim possibly a tenth of its 1,300-odd workforce as it looks to keep a tighter lid on costs. the plan is to keep its cost-to-income ratio (cir)  already one of the lowest in the industry at 22.36% last year  consistently below 23% over the five-year period. it also includes plans for mbsb to embark on a merger and acquisition (m&a) exercise in about a year or so as the group looks to migrate towards a banking platform as part of its aspiration to become an islamic financial institution (fi), ceo datuk ahmad zaini othman says. for mbsb, moving forward, we want to place ourselves in a situation to conform to all the best practices and standards of an fi. and for us to do that, to accelerate that, we do need to look at a potential corporate exercise, but this is ultimately subject to our shareholders endorsement. we call it corporate exercise because we dont know whos going to take over who. a potential corporate exercise is something that we must seriously look at, at least within the next year or so, for us to continue to carry mbsb into the next phase of our business plan, ahmad zaini tells the edge in his first one-on-one media interview since the proposed merger with cimb group holdings bhd and rhb capital bhd fell through last month. the merger, had it gone through, would have seen mbsb being acquired by cimb-rhbs islamic banking operations to become a mega islamic bank. ahmad zaini says mbsb, which is 64.14% owned by the employees provident fund (epf), had little choice but to agree to being swallowed in that planned exercise because it was dealing with much bigger entities  cimb and rhb. any future m&a exercises, however, could see mbsb taking the lead, he says. this time around, of course with the blessing of the major shareholder, we should take the lead, really. i think we should, he remarks. he declines to name potential acquisition targets but says they need not necessarily be smaller in size. analysts and industry observers speculate that bank islam malaysia bhd, bank simpanan nasional bhd and bank muamalat malaysia bhd are likely to be on mbsbs radar. mbsb is slightly smaller than the lembaga tabung haji-controlled bank islam in terms of asset size, but is far more profitable and has better control of costs. analysts say bank muamalat, controlled by tycoon tan sri syed mokhtar albukharys drb-hicom bhd, could make a good merger partner but it could be tough to strike a deal as the latter would want to be in the drivers seat of the merged entity. drb-hicom owns 70% of bank muamalat and has been given multiple extensions by the central bank to pare down its stake to 40%. ahmad zaini says another option mbsb could explore to expand, apart from an m&a with a local entity, is a business collaboration with a partner in indonesia. he says that it was something mbsb had been exploring in earnest before the cimb-rhb merger was proposed last july. these are the kinds of things well look at again  80% of our assets are already islamic, so its a natural progression for us to aspire to become an islamic fi, either as a standalone [entity] or through some form of corporate exercise. he says the aborted merger was a costly exercise for the group as it had invested much time and effort in it. however, there were lessons to be learnt from it and the group can go into its next m&a exercise wiser, he claims. we spent about six to seven months on this exercise [and] we stopped a lot of the things we wanted to do. we could not recruit people  they didnt want to join us because of the uncertainty the merger brought about  and we lost a few people along the way. business opportunities were also lost, in a sense. so from that point of view, it was costly. whats positive, however, is that weve learnt a lot  ive learnt a lot  so next time around, we know what to do, what not to do and what to expect. so in that sense, weve gained. from the monetary sense, yes, weve lost quite a bit because advisers and legal fees need to be paid, regardless. i call these heavy tuition fees, he laughs. ahmad zaini joined the group in 2009 and went on to spearhead mbsbs first five-year transformation plan that led to the group posting a record net profit every year to 2014, helped by a focus on the once-profitable personal financing (pf) business for government servants. just last week, mbsb announced a net profit of rm1.02 billion for the year ended dec 31, 2014 (fy2014), compared with just rm57.2 million back in fy2009. its fy2014 profit was 70% higher than that a year ago despite having adopted more stringent loan provisioning standards last year in its bid to become more like a bank. the profit was boosted by the recognition of rm366.06 million in deferred tax assets. the groups net non-performing loan (npl) ratio improved to 4.1% from 5.4% a year ago. beginning january 2014, mbsb had moved towards the industrys npl classification of three months in arrears, from the previous six months in arrears. but the banking environment has since become more turbulent and the next five years are not expected to be easy for fis. the most significant thing about the next five years is that it is a totally new ball game. its a new economic environment, new challenges, new regulatory expectations and the stakeholders expectations are different. so, we cant carry on business as usual like we did five years ago. before, we could be a bit more aggressive in certain things, but now, we just have to align ourselves back to the banking environment. and this is the big challenge for us for the next five years, he says. mbsbs loan growth target for that period is a more sober 7% to 8% annually. this compares with a gross loan growth of 51.4% in fy2012 and 18.4% in fy2013. last year, because of the more difficult environment and having reduced its dependency on the pf businesses after the central bank introduced more stringent rules, growth was just 2.4%. according to ahmad zaini, pf is something the group will continue to focus on, but it also plans to develop more products that leverage its angkasa bpa code and the ag (accountant general) code, which allow mbsb to directly deduct from the salaries of civil servants in the servicing of loans. under the new five-year plan, mbsb aims to increase the contribution of its fee-based activities, which currently constitute just 4% of its total income, in a bid to diversify. were trying to push it up to 7% to 10% over the next two years or so, he says. mbsb also plans to accelerate its credit collection. ahmad zaini himself heads the task force created to accelerate and manage bad debt collection. this is mostly on the retail side. the corporate side is good u2026 weve only got one legacy loan under corporate and the rest are small ones. thats a big achievement for us. the ones in the pf portfolio u2026 these are actually what i call performing npls  the borrowers are paying but they are paying us late because theyve already left the government service and are hence no longer under the automatic salary deductions. so, what we need to do is work out some restructuring exercise with them, he explains. on the planned job cuts, ahmad zaini says: what we want to do first is look at all our contract staff and those under agency roles. well maybe trim down those first. i look at this right sizing exercise as achieving two key objectives  one is, of course, the cost aspect as youre going to get some savings there. but a more important thing is that were also delivering a message to the rest of the staff that they do need to increase their competency. he says the right sizing exercise will involve cutting maybe 10% of mbsbs workforce, some of which will be done this year. if i can maintain our cir at under 23% and see out this period of turbulence, i think were going to come out well in terms of the numbers. right now, our cir is 22.36% u2026 well have to give and take some of this because of the prudential costs that were going to incur. this right sizing exercise is important because if we were to go into any form of corporate exercise, at least we will be a bit more lean for our eventual partners, so we do need to do this well, he says. on hindsight, mbsbs aborted merger with cimb and rhb could well be a blessing in disguise, he says. all parties had decided to cease talks due to bad timing as economic conditions had turned unfavourable. still, the epf also owns a 41.49% stake in rhb, and it has long been speculated that any m&a that involves either rhb or mbsb would also involve the other. all eyes will be on ahmad zaini to see how well he handles the groups next growth phase and whether it will remain a standalone entity.  note: the edge researchs

seen quite a number of senior-level movements and resignations over the last few months, leading to management revamps in at least six banks. the changes, which began last year, seem to have picked up steam this year. in less than six months, four local banking groups (cimb group holdings bhd, ammb holdings bhd, rhb capital bhd and alliance bank malaysia bhd) and four foreign banks (citibank bhd, standard chartered bank malaysia bhd, kuwait finance house malaysia bhd and al rajhi banking & investment corp malaysia bhd) have either announced new leaders or that their leaders are leaving. others, like hong leong bank bhd, have made key management appointments. i think these changes are happening for different reasons  some are the result of long-serving staff wanting to leave while others are moving up the career ladder  and its purely coincidental that it all seems to be taking place at around the same time, says a senior industry official, who has been in banking for over 20 years. but a change of guard is good, in most instances. were a small market ... we need new blood, new energy, new ideas every few years. this is especially so in banking and investment banking  theres always a need to refresh as there are so many changes in it, changes to the rules. the environment has got a lot tougher, so people also need to change. i dont see any cause for concern. the ball started rolling in september last year when tengku datuk zafrul aziz of cimb (fundamental: 1.35; valuation: 2.1)  who had joined the group in january from malayan banking bhd  took the helm from datuk seri nazir razak. nazir vacated the ceos seat to become the group chairman while zafrul became acting ceo of the countrys second largest banking group. then, in october, citibank appointed lee lung nien as its new ceo. lee succeeded sanjeev nanavati, citibanks longest-serving ceo, who left in july last year. on jan 1 this year, alliance financial group bhd (afg) appointed joel kornreich as the group ceo of its banking unit alliance bank malaysia. kornreich, who was the country business manager of citibanks global consumer group in south korea, took over from singaporean sng seow wah, who left the group in october last year. two months later, it was announced that sng would be made president director of indonesian lender pt bank danamon indonesia tbk when its current leader, henry ho, retires this year. singapores investment arm, temasek holdings, is a substantial shareholder of both bank danamon and afg (fundamental: 2; valuation: 2.2). just last week, rhb (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 2.1) announced that its group managing director kellee kam had resigned. sources told the edge financial daily that rhbs deputy group managing director datuk khairussaleh ramli was among the shortlisted names to succeed kam. kam, who had taken on his current role four years ago in 2011, had been with the rhb group for 13 years. it will be interesting to see where he emerges. in its announcement to bursa malaysia on feb 12, rhb said the group had a succession plan in place and will execute a transition plan for the smooth handover of responsibilities to kams potential successor. sources also tell the edge that ong ju yan, head of rhb investment banks group corporate and investment banking services, has resigned and will be joining his family business. ong is the eldest son of tan sri ong leong huat, a major shareholder of rhb and the founder of the osk group. on jan 29, ammb (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 3) announced that its group managing director ashok ramamurthy would be stepping down as part of a planned transition, confirming an earlier report by theedgemarkets.com that a major shake-up at the top level of ambank group was on the cards. sources also told theedgemarkets.com last month that the managing director of wholesale banking coverage, pushpa rajadurai, and the managing director of aminvestment bank bhd, kok tuck cheong, would also be leaving the group when their contracts expire. in a statement to the stock exchange, ammb said it had commenced the process of identifying a replacement for the group managing directors position. it also said pushpa, kok and group chief financial officer mandy simpson had existing contracts and would continue to serve the group in accordance with them. ammb also announced last week that it had appointed datuk seri ahmad johan raslan as its senior adviser and board member. johan is the former executive chairman of pricewaterhousecoopers malaysia. last tuesday, standard chartered bank said it had appointed mahendra gursahani as its managing director and ceo for malaysia with immediate effect. mahendra, who has been with standard chartered for over 20 years, succeeds osman morad, who has retired. late last year, al rajhis ceo datuk azrulnizam abdul aziz quit after 2u00bd years at the helm. the bank has since appointed selamat sirat as its acting ceo. and then in november, another foreign islamic bank  kfh malaysia  announced that its ceo datuk seri abdul hamidy abdul hafiz had tendered his resignation. the board then appointed chief recovery officer datuk mohamad aslam khan gulam hassan as the acting ceo. earlier this month, cimb announced a further management reshuffle as part of its new mid-term strategy plan. the reshuffle also came about because three key staff members  datuk lee kok kwan (ceo of corporate banking, treasury and markets), kenny kim (group cfo and ceo of group strategy and strategic investments) and arwin rashid (president director and ceo of bank cimb niaga)  expressed their desire to eventually leave the group, the edge reported, citing sources. all three no longer hold management roles in the new line-up. lee and kim, in particular, who have been with the group for many years and are among nazirs trusted lieutenants, were given advisory roles. lee will also become a board member while arwin retires in a few months. meanwhile, hong leong bank made two senior appointments to its management team. dominic mascrinas was made chief operating officer for group strategic support while charles sik was made chief operating officer for

{"date_posted": "16/3/2015", "title": "trade wise: ghl cashes in on imminent payment reforms", "article": " bank negara malaysias renewed push to speed up the countrys transition to a cashless society has helped open doors for ghl systems bhd (fundamental: 1.40; valuation: 0.30) in expanding its transaction payment acquisition (tpa) business. the central bank is targeting debit card transactions to multiply from 90 million per year now to a billion annually by 2020 while the number of point-of-sale terminals is expected to balloon to 800,000 by 2020 from 280,000 now. to encourage the use of debit cards, bank negara has imposed a ceiling on interchange fees payable by the acquiring banks to the banks that issue the payment cards. for domestic debit card payments, the fees shall not exceed 0.15% of the transaction value or 50 sen plus 0.01% of the transaction value, whichever is lower. it was music to our ears when bank negara announced this framework ... it will open doors for us, says ghl ceo lorenz raj. tpa is intended to be ghls growth engine going forward. this business segment involves acquiring merchants, for example shops or dining outlets that accept card payments by deploying ghls payment system. as the third-party acquirer, ghl will talk to the commercial banks to become the merchants banks that authorise the transactions. in the process, it will earn a fraction of the transaction fee that the merchants are charged for payments received. lorenz acknowledges that there has been little progress in the past year or so in terms of getting merchants to sign up for accepting card payments. we have been knocking on doors in the past one year ... i must say the progress has been slow. but with the new targets that bank negara has set, i think the banks are incentivised to promote debit card usage ... all this while, the commercial banks have been concentrating on credit cards. stressing that there is a role for ghl to play in getting more merchants to accept debit card payments, lorenz says, the banks have been focusing on the big merchants. most of the time, small businesses like mechanic shops or beauty salons are neglected. ghl will acquire these so-called small merchants, something that the banks find tedious and costly to do. he notes that it would be difficult for the commercial banks to meet bank negaras targets unless the small businesses also accept debit card payments. in fact, most of the banks are already ghls clients but this is mostly for credit-card operations. the group plans to acquire 4,000 small merchants this year, which would grow its recurring income base substantially. if we can handle just 2,000 merchants a month that would already make us the largest merchant acquirer in asean. we are making inroads into thailand and the philippines as well, both of which are underserved markets, says lorenz. the group looks well positioned to ride this broad market reform, which could translate into steady earnings growth if it gains traction. recently, the group entered into an agreement with global payments card processing malaysia sdn bhd to act as a payment facilitator and payment service provider using the tpa model. lorenz sees the partnership with global payments as a milestone for ghl. under the agreement, it will, among others, acquire eligible new merchants by providing sales, marketing and onboarding services on behalf of global payments. additionally, ghl will facilitate transactions and the settlement of funds between global payments and the new merchants. following global payments, which is partnering hsbc bank, we are in discussions with another significant malaysian bank and we are hopeful of a positive outcome soon, says lorenz. an agreement with micro-lender amanah ikhtiar malaysia sdn bhd (aim) two weeks ago entails the deployment of 8,000 payment terminals to facilitate e-payments by the companys 350,000 borrowers. the tpa business appears to be promising and will enable ghl to have a recurring income base from fees earned from each transaction. nonetheless, it will also be exposed to credit risks. yes, there is credit risk, so we need to have a risk management system to monitor all the merchants that have signed up with us, says lorenz. we have spent millions on developing the [monitoring] system that will raise red flags whenever a merchant acts suspicious. we have hired officers who were formerly working for banks for our risk management system. meanwhile, revenue generated from debit card transactions is minimal, says lorenz. earnings from the tpa division are largely contributed by e-pay asia ltd (epy), which ghl has bought over from its controlling shareholder, simon loh, who holds a 36% stake in ghl. epy provides payment solutions for uploading prepaid phones, utility bill payments and so forth. for the nine months ended sept 30, ghl posted a net profit of rm6.41 million, up 14% from rm5.61 million in the previous corresponding period. revenue grew to rm115.8 million from rm50.97 million. in a feb 12 note, cimb research says this could translate into an additional net profit of up to rm2.7 million in fy2015 and fy2016. it projects a revenue of rm216 million and net profit of rm16.06 million for ghl in fy2015. the research house has pegged a fair value of rm1.10 to the stock, which closed at 85.5 sen last tuesday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm547.6 million. the target price is based on a forward earnings multiple of 23.8 times as well as ghls strong expected compound annual growth rate of 76% in its

construction sector\nmaintain overweight. the malaysian reserve reported that selangor menteri besar mohamed azmin ali said the state government will scrutinise all federal infrastructure proposals in selangor, following the disagreement over the water deals. as at december 2014, the selangor government has yet to begin executing 494, or 64.7%, of the 763 development projects approved under the 10th malaysia plan (10mp). sources said that the state government may also call off the damansara-shah alam elevated expressway (dash) highway project, amid pressure from anti-dash lobbyists. this news is unexpected, but we believe the negative impact on the construction and materials sector and stocks under our coverage is likely to be minimal. seven major highway jobs under the 10mp worth rm21 billion make up less than 15% of the rm150 billion overall incoming jobs. from our analysis, we conclude that major highways that have been approved and awarded (east klang valley expressway, duta-ulu kelang expressway extension and west coast expressway) should be safe, but dash, sungai besi-ulu kelang expressway and serdang-kinrara-putrajaya expressway could be under heavy scrutiny, going by the cancellation of kinrara-damansara expressway recently. the good news is that tender books of most contractors under our coverage are not heavily exposed to new highways, except for mudajaya group bhd. we would not interpret this news as a major setback at this juncture, and still prefer the sectors big cap and liquid stocks with strong order book growth potential like gamuda

story: with confidence down, can wages keep growing?", "article": " last year was a good year for malaysian employees, who saw above-average increments and bonuses, while robust recruitment throughout the year offered many opportunities for job hoppers vying for better pay. but on the back of several high-profile layoffs late last year and early this year, 2015 might not be such a good year. consumer sentiment is cautious, the property market is softening, interest rates are up, the stock market is down and the economic outlook as a whole simply isnt as bullish. and when businesses lose confidence, salaries and hiring tend to slow down too. in such an environment, what can malaysian workers expect from the job market this year? a good year actually, but only if you are a skilled professional in the mid-to-top level of your field, say the countrys top recruiters. we genuinely do not see any evidence of a slowdown at all for the skilled workforce from the mid to senior level, not even within oil and gas. the need for local skilled individuals is as high as ever, says hays specialist recruitment (malaysia) ltd country manager tom osborne. osbornes focus,however, is on the mid to high end of the job market where hays operates. at the lower end, there has been a steady stream of news that has driven concern about a softening job market  nothing that will see unemployment rise, but slower wage growth and possibly fewer opportunities. compared with 2014, more employers say they will be hiring less this year, while fewer employers say they will be hiring more this year. as a lead indicator, it suggests that confidence of the market is weaker, but that doesnt mean it will be a bad year. 2014 was a very good year for us, says jobstreet country manager chook yuh yng. she points out that postings on the recruitment site have not shown any signs of slowing down in january. however, listings in march, the peak recruitment period, will be more telling of 2015s outlook. jobstreet primarily covers white-collar recruitment ads from entry to mid-level positions. the companys survey in late 2014 shows only 37% of managers plan to hire more staff this year, compared with 49% in 2014. at the same time, 24% of survey takers said they would be hiring less this year, compared with 14% in 2014 (see employers planning to hire less below). it doesnt help that one of the countrys largest employers, malaysian airline system bhd, is in the midst of trimming 6,000 staff from its 20,000 strong headcount. even if most of the staff are reskilled and redeployed among other companies, it would still soak up a large number of vacancies. while one could argue that mass layoffs could have been expected, it came as a surprise when standard chartered bank announced the shutdown of its equities business in asia resulting in 11% of its malaysian workforce being laid off. not long after, cimb group holdings bhd announced that it would be closing its australian investment banking business. it may not be local, but the bank will have a number of australia-based staff to redeploy locally. adding to the concern, there has been talk in the market of voluntary separation schemes being undertaken in some of the big local banks. strangely enough, financial services had been one of the most aggressive sectors in hiring last year. according to chook, jobstreet saw a 27% increase in recruitment ads for positions in banking and financial services in 2014, making it the fastest growing sector in terms of recruitment. it is also the second largest sector by jobstreet recruitment ads (see top five job postings by industry). there might be some slowdown at the investment banking and equities level, but that only makes a small portion of recruitment in financial services. commercial and retail banking continues to do well, and there continues to be high demand for front office, revenue-generating positions, says sally raj, managing director of robert walters malaysia, a professional recruitment consultancy. it is not going to be a hunky-dory year. there is a lot of perceived negativity in the market and there are industries that will face a dip. but there is not going to be a complete downturn, adds sally. meanwhile, the fall in crude oil prices to less than us$50 a barrel in the past few months also puts the oil and gas (o&g) sector in the limelight. upstream operations that have on- going long-term supply contracts should not be substantially affected but the o&g service and support businesses are expecting a slowdown. after all, the countrys largest employer in the sector, petroliam nasional bhd (petronas), plans to slash capital expenditure and operational expenditure by up to 15%, and between 25% and 30%, respectively, this year. we dont cover the technical o&g, in relation to drilling engineers and rotation engineers. but based on the cvs that we have received, there are a lot of these people approaching us now for jobs. their contracts have ended prematurely or their rates have come down, notes sally. although he has observed some retrenchment in malaysia, hays osborne maintains that the skills shortage in the industry remains, especially for highly specialised and senior roles. the downturn in oil prices does not have an immediate effect on salaries. however the longer the oil price stays low, the greater the impact will be on overall staffing demand, which will ultimately impact salaries as competition for jobs increases, he adds. nonetheless, malaysian salaries remained relatively competitive in terms of increments, when compared with the region. according to a survey by hays, 40% of malaysians received an increment of more than 6% last year, compared with the 29% average across countries like china, hong kong, japan and singapore. looking ahead, even more employees are expected to get increments exceeding 6%. forty-three per cent of malaysian companies surveyed plan to hand out increments of more than 6%. in comparison, the average among countries surveyed was only 30% (see salary increases below). divergence within job market at the lower end of the job market however, jobstreets survey paints a slightly different picture, with less bonuses planned for this year as well as smaller than expected increments. the survey shows that employers only plan to reward about 31% of employees with a bonus of two months or more this year. in comparison, 35% of staff were rewarded with bonuses exceeding two months last year. employees are also expecting bigger increments than employers are willing to give, notes chook. according to the survey, employers are only planning to give 31% of staff an increment exceeding 6%. however, over 54% of employees are expecting such a raise. in a nutshell, it will continue to be an employees market for highly skilled professionals and specialists. meanwhile, the lower end of the job market may see slower hiring and smaller increments. this is not unusual. it is something we see in many countries. companies are willing to pay a high premium for skilled and experienced employees because there is a huge skills shortage, says hays managing director christine wright. as malaysias economy grows and businesses grow, it creates new roles and increases vacancies. businesses then need to compete for talent. it is a trend we have seen in other developing economies, she explains. on the other hand, companies are not willing to pay a high price for candidates without experience, since the firms are basically paying for soft skills  the candidates potential to develop, she adds. nonetheless, graduates tend to have very high expectations, says chook. on average, graduates pay is about rm2,100 a month. while this isnt very high, it has been increasing over the years. however, the graduates on average are expecting to be paid rm3,500. this is a very large gap and it needs to be lowered, she says. poaching vs developing according to a robert walters report, employees can expect from 22% to as high as 30% increments when they change jobs, particularly those who have the right skills and experience. this is largely due to the shortage of talent to fill the ever-growing number of mid to high-level vacancies. so, what about candidates who lack the skills? at the moment, companies would rather pay cash for people with the right skills than invest the resources to develop these candidates themselves. however, as the skills gap continues to grow, this will change, says wright. companies need to invest in developing their employees to fill their vacancies and retain staff. employees need to see an upward career trajectory and want to be part of a company that is growing, she says. in fact, lack of career development is the main reason why three quarters of respondents were unhappy with their current jobs, according to the jobstreet survey. only 45.6% of respondents see themselves staying with the company for less than one year while 36% would likely leave after three years. lack of career growth was the main reason cited. multinational companies are ahead of local businesses in people development, osborne says, i think that is recognised internally and within the local businesses. they are making strides to gear up to that level of standard. the candidates are aware of that as well. if local companies divert more resources into developing talent instead of poaching it from rivals, it would certainly narrow the skills gap in the country, adds wright. however, the government and industry would have to work closely with educational institutions to make sure the right skills are being developed for the workforce of the future. companies will always want someone who can meet the job description, 10/10. but most of the time, the candidates are only a 6/10 or 7/10. the question is whether these candidates have the soft skills, the potential to be developed into a 10/10, says osborne. malaysians traditionally travel very well throughout the world. they are very diverse in their soft skills. when exposed to lots of different situations, when they need to use their soft skills, they do excel, he adds.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on february 16 - 22, 2015."}, "515": {"date_posted": "13/3/2015", "title": "cimb makes changes at the top",

valuation: 0.3) and carlsberg brewery malaysia bhd (fundamental: 2.3; valuation: 2.1) as currency winners. etiqa insurance & takaful head of research chris eng believes e&e firms could be a positive surprise. these companies are beneficiaries of the strong greenback and higher demand for white goods (heavy consumer durables such as refrigerators and air conditioners), he tells the edge over the telephone. despite the electricity tariff reduction announced early last month, analysts continue to favour the utility sector, particularly tenaga nasional bhd (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.8). the government has announced a 5.8% or 2.25 sen per kwh electricity tariff reduction for peninsular malaysia. this will come into effect between march 1 and june 30. tariffs in sabah will also be reduced by 3.5% or 1.2 sen per kwh in the same period. eng says tenaga is likely to perform well despite the temporary rebate. he adds that it will be netted off against the reversals from the over-recovery of tenagas fuel costs. tenaga still has a strong core net profit. so, it is not an issue. over the long term, yee says tenaga will benefit from lower fuel costs and capacity expansion in excess of 1,000mw. revision in tariff is only a short-term knee-jerk reaction, as we believe in the longer run. on the whole, rhb research institute head of research alexander chia says companies with expanded capacity will be instrumental in bringing about earnings growth.\ncapital expenditure investment in new capacity is largely completed, therefore, new facilities are beginning to contribute new revenue, he says, citing examples of hartalega holdings bhd (fundamental: 2.6; valuation: 0.3), hovid bhd (fundamental: 2.1; valuation: 0.3) and cahya mata sarawak bhd (fundamental: 3.0; valuation: 1.5). sectors that may underperform this year include plantation and property. these two sectors could see some downside risks due to the lack of growth drivers, says chia. bimbs yee says the less efficient plantation companies are most likely to find it tough, given market pressure capping cpo prices. so long as cpo prices remain at current levels, maintaining margins is of utmost importance. he says developers offering properties in less alluring locations may suffer from selective demand, given that loans are more restrictive now. uob kay hians khoo notes that there could be pockets of mild downside risk this year for some companies due to situational triggers. umw holdings bhd (fundamental: 2.2; valuation: 1.2) could be a loser of a weaker ringgit due to us dollar-denominated costs in its automotive division, and axiata group bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 0.9) for poor underlying performance at its indonesian telecoms business and foreign exchange losses. genting malaysia bhd (fundamental: 2.4; valuation: 0.6) would incorporate one-off costs related to its failed new york casino bid. he notes that cimb group holdings bhd (fundamental: 1.35; valuation: 2.1) is also a potential loser amid a likely spike in credit costs, moderating loans growth, funding cost pressures and continued weakness in investment banking deal flows. the oil and gas sector, which has been snagging headlines since the second half of last year, will continue to be in the spotlight this year as the market will diligently track crude oil prices, chia opines. much depends on where oil prices are heading  if they make a reversal and go down again, the market will head downwards as a result, he says. lower crude oil prices will translate into lower revenue for oil and gas firms, and consequently see margins shrink.

under saas, smaller property companies can rent, instead of buy, ifcas software. these companies will pay a monthly subscription fee to ifca, which will contribute to the companys recurring income. we

surprise on the upside. ifca looks like its heading for another record year in fy15, with growth coming from the china market and gst software upgrade jobs. we are particularly excited about saas. in the next few years, saas could boost recurring income so the company will be less dependent on revenue from just selling software. interestingly, the impending implementation of gst on april 1 is

low oil prices", "article": " loss-making asia bioenergy technologies bhd (asiabio), which is listed on bursa malaysia as an incubator fund, wants to diversify into the oil and gas (o&g) transport sector. such plan raises eyebrows as the o&g industry has been going through a rough patch. the news put the companys share price on a roller-coaster ride in the past few weeks, with its trading volume surging above the daily average. the counter climbed 29% to 24.5 sen after the announcement on jan 30, its highest level since march 2009, before slipping nearly 33% to 16.5 sen on feb 4. year to date, asiabio (fundamental: 1.20; valuation: 0.0) has appreciated 32%. there are doubts as to whether the plan for asiabio, which is currently involved in biodiesel business, would ever take off, let alone being a lifesaver for the company. in an interview with the edge, asiabio executive director steve tan sik eek says now is a good time for the group to acquire petroleum tanker companies as operating costs are low. the low oil prices actually make a lot of difference. moving forward, a company like semua shipping is good for investment because the operating costs have come down. we may not be able to seize this opportunity when oil is at us$100 per barrel, he says. to recap, on jan 27, asiabio announced that it had entered into a heads of agreement (hoa) with hoe leong corp ltd, sumatec resources bhd and reachmont logistics sdn bhd in relation to a series of transactions for the eventual acquisitions of semua shipping and semado maritime. according to the hoa, the acquisitions will be satisfied with the issuance of new asiabio shares worth up to rm168 million, or about 20% of the companys enlarged share base, as a consideration. the entire shares of semua shipping and semado maritime will be transferred to a special purpose vehicle (spv). the vendors will then enter into a shareholders agreement, whereby hoe leong and sumatec (fundamental: 2.60; valuation: 0.30) will hold stakes in the spv, based on their respective stakes in semua international. sumatecs 49% stake in the spv will be transferred to reachmont logistics. in return, reachmont logistics will pay off part of the rm56 million debts owed by sumatec to its bondholders as a consideration for the spv stake. information is scarce on the identity of reachmont logistics. according to the companies commission of malaysia, the shareholders of the company are radijah abdul razak and aziah musa. the due diligence process will only start this week. it is learnt that the vendors are looking at a sale price of rm168 million. asiabios optimism is understandable, considering the surge in demand for tankers to transport petroleum and petroleum products as many energy-hungry asian countries are taking advantage of the current weak oil prices to stockpile fuel. there is also rising demand for fuel storage space. according to tanker brokers, requests for vessels to be converted into storage spaces for fuel products have been increasing. as a result, supply of shipping tankers will be tighter, thus pushing up rates, say the brokers. furthermore, the low crude oil prices would be a boon because bunker fuel accounts for 30% to 35% of the total operating costs of a shipping company, tan explains. cimb research analyst gan jian bo anticipates tanker rates to rise 40% this year, continuing from last years increase of about 70%. the demand for tanker transport services is also expected to outstrip new deliveries for the second consecutive year. based on the expected new building deliveries and scrapping rates this year, we believe tanker supply growth will be mild at just 1.1% year on year. meanwhile, demand is estimated to grow 2.1% amid stronger imports from asia, states gan in a jan 22 report. asiabio has been making losses since its financial year ended jan 31, 2012 (fy2012). for the nine months to oct 31, 2014, the company posted a net loss of rm1.28 million on revenue of rm36.1 million. at the press conference to announce the deal, tan says the spv is expected to achieve a profit after tax (pat) of rm14 million for fy2015. the combined pat of semua shipping and semado maritime last year was rm8 million, he adds. according to tan, both semua shipping and semado maritime have ongoing contracts worth rm200 million to transport refined petroleum from the refineries in miri to major ports in peninsular malaysia. however, these contracts are at the tail end of their tenure, raising uncertainties over earnings prospects. the managements of semua shipping and semado maritime will renegotiate with the client, which is an oil major in sarawak, to extend the contracts by at least another two years, he says. we want to grow this business. when the time is right, we will acquire new ships. in the industry at the moment, petroleum producers will only give out logistics contracts if the bidding company already owns a vessel. however, most companies would only place an order for a tanker if they have already secured a contract. the issue is cost  it ranges from us$20 million to us$30 million per vessel. this industry is definitely not for the faint-hearted, he says. asiabio is confident that it will be able to raise the required capital to grow its petroleum tanker business as it is backed by strong shareholders. besides cpe capital growth ltd, a china-based private equity firm that owns a 11.13% stake in asiabio, perlaburan mara bhd also holds a 10% stake in the group. while the transaction price has not been finalised, hoe leong and reachmont logistics are expected to hold substantial stakes in asiabio, should the acquisitions materialise. however, it is not clear whether hoe leong will retain its stake in asiabio given that semua shippings performance has been below its expectations. however, due to below-expectation performance of the semua group, the company believes that the proposed transactions would allow the company to free up cash and strengthen its balance sheet, settle various liabilities and disputes with third parties, hoe leong states in the announcement to the singapore exchange. when hoe leong first acquired a block of shares in semua international back in 2010, it was guaranteed a pat of at least rm31 million for the financial year ended dec 31, 2011, by sumatec. however, semua international only recorded a pat of rm14.25 million. should the deal materialise, it would be interesting to see how asiabio would grow this cyclical business, which prospects hinge on the movements of crude oil prices. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if

the ringgit was much weaker against the us dollar at 3.654 as brent crude oil remained steady at us$60.20 per barrel. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 had key swings of 1,837.28

macd and stochastic but positive readings for its dmi and oscillator. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at the 1,738, 1,770 and 1,800 levels, while the resistance areas of 1,806, 1,831 and 1,858 will cap any index rebound. the fbm klcis 18 and 40 simple moving averages (sma) depict a neutral trend for its daily chart. however, the price bars of the index are now between the 50 and 200 sma and remains in a neutral position on that front. the recent fall from its all-time high of 1,896.23 saw a trough at 1,671.82. the price rebound from 1,671.82 stalled at 1,831.41 (on feb 4 2015) and remains below the 200-sma line of 1,828.61. due to the poorer tone for the fbm klci index, we are recommending a chart sell on brahims holdings bhd (brahims). recently, brahims made the news after agreeing to new terms for its in-flight supplies agreement with malaysian airlines (mas). as part of the mas cost restructuring by khazanah nasional, brahims 25-year rm6.25 billion exclusive contract will take a 25% cut in monthly bills, pending a new catering deal. brahims also agreed to a 60% cut in payments withheld by mas. the negative news flow has triggered the wave of recent selling that drove brahims share price down below rm1. looking at its fourth quarter of financial year 2014 (4qfy14) results announcement, brahims recorded a 27.5% fall in revenue to rm79 million in this quarter from rm109 million in 4qfy13. the group also recorded a pre-tax loss of rm58 million in 4qfy14 compared with a profit of rm22 million in 4qfy13. the poor profitability was due to concessions given to mas under its recovery plan amounting to rm56 million by its subsidiary. brahims also pointed out that the in-flight catering segment continues to remain challenging despite the expected increase in passenger load as its profit margins may be adversely impacted by the implementation of a new pricing methodology. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that only two research houses have coverage on brahims. of the two research houses there is one sell call and one hold call. brahims 12-month trailing earnings per share on bloomberg indicate a loss of 14 sen. its price-to-book value ratio of 0.68 times indicates that its share price is trading at a discount to its book value. brahims chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly down. its share price made a massive decline since its all-time high of rm2.71 on march 7, 2014. since that rm2.71 high, brahims fell to its recent low of 81 sen this month. as prices broke below its recent key critical support levels of rm1.16 and rm1.12, look to sell brahims on any rebounds to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term downtrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, stochastic and oscillator) have issued sell signals and now depict very firm indications of brahims eventual move towards much lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of 81 sen, rm1.12 and rm1.16. we expect brahims to witness weak buying interest at its supports of 55 sen, 74 sen and 80 sen. its downside targets are located at 40 sen, 36 sen, 30 sen and 18 sen.  lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed in the article are the opinions of the writer

holdings bhd, which include a business reorganisation, a management reshuffle and plans to cut costs substantially, underscore efforts to ride out a tougher banking environment. industry observers say the restructuring  cimbs third major one since 2005  is necessary to stem the slide in the groups performance in recent years. the changes, announced last friday, are also seen as a stamping of the mark by the groups new leader, acting ceo tengku datuk zafrul aziz. zafrul, 42 this year, had joined cimb (fundamental 1.35; valuation: 2.10) in january 2014 from malayan banking bhd. later in september, he took on the top post at the group, replacing datuk seri nazir razak who went on to become the chairman. sources say the management reshuffle, which includes the creation of a few new posts, also came about because three key individuals  datuk lee kok kwan (ceo of corporate banking, treasury and markets), kenny kim (group cfo and ceo of group strategy and strategic investments) and arwin rashid (country head for indonesia as well as president director and ceo of bank cimb niaga)  had expressed their desire to eventually leave. all three are no longer in management roles in the new line-up. lee and kim, in particular, are some of nazirs trusted lieutenants who have been with the group through thick and thin over the years. thus, it is no surprise that they have been given advisory roles in the new line-up. lee, 48, who has been with the group since 1996 and helped set up its risk management department, will go on to become a board member while arwin, 57, plans to retire in a few months. kim, 46, has played a key role in cimbs major corporate exercises, including all its mergers, acquisitions and disposals since 2004, as well as the regional integration of all the businesses under the group. analysts believe the reshuffle is part of a bigger plan where zafrul is reorganising the team to adjust to the changing banking landscape. they believe the stalwarts will stay on to ensure a smooth transition. theedgemarkets.com had reported earlier last friday that there would be a management reshuffle at cimb. the relatively new management team will see to the implementation of the groups mid-term strategy, known as t18 (short for target 2018). zafrul, in a press release, said as part of t18, a new regional commercial and sme banking division would be created. there will also be a new integrated wholesale banking division (combining investment banking, treasury markets and corporate banking) as well as a regional consumer banking division. analysts believe there may be job cuts in the offing. under t18, cimb is looking at cutting investment banking operating costs by about 30% this year as part of a plan to reassess its investment banking presence in asia-pacific. it gained that presence after buying most of the royal bank of scotlands investment banking assets in asia-pacific in 2012, a move that raised its costs substantially. we will be rightsizing, toughening our regional operating model and streamlining processes. and this is just phase 1 of a long list of cost management measures the firm is undertaking, zafrul said. t18 came about from a strategic review exercise that the group began in january last year. elaborating on the groups t18 targets, zafrul said he expects cimb to achieve, by the end of the financial year 2018, a return on equity (roe) of more than 15%, cet-1 of more than 11% and a cost-to-income ratio of less than 50%, and consumer banking to contribute about 60% to its income. cimbs roe has been on a downward trend since fy2012 while its cost-to-income ratio has been trending upwards since fy2011. from 16.4% in fy2011, roe had dropped to 16% in fy2012 and 15.5% in fy2013. the groups annualised 9mfy2014 net roe stood at 11.6%, its cost-to-income ratio at 57.8% and cet-1 at 9.7%. its consumer banking segment accounted for 44.2% of profit before tax for the nine months to sept 30, 2014, while corporate, treasury and markets contributed 44.8%, investment 10.5% and investment banking 0.5%. meanwhile, the cost-to-income ratio has been rising, from 55.68% in fy2010 to 54.69% in fy2011, 56.4% in fy2012 and 57.6% in fy2013.  it looks like they are serious about cost but it is a long-term target of three years. cimb will have to demonstrate to the market that they can execute this. they have set targets before and not met them. for example, their roe target for 2014 of 13.5% to 14% is likely to be missed. the market will want to see more evidence of a concrete action plan before they are willing to take their word for it, says a banking analyst.  also from the announcement, it looks like some of the old guard are vacating their positions. the market already assumed this will be happening. all eyes will be on whether this new reorganisation will bring about the results that cimb says it expects to achieve. a reorganisation is a reorganisation, whether it will work or not u2026 only time will tell. another banking analyst says bringing down the ib cost by 30% is a big task. if they succeed, it will be good for the group. another interesting point is that in order for them to achieve the 15% roe, cimb will likely have to double their current profits by 2018. they must have at least rm7.5 billion to rm8 billion in net profit to achieve their 15% roe target. actually, what they are doing is bold and long-term positive if executed well. the change of roles for lee and kim will cushion a bigger fallout than if they were to completely leave the bank now. a head of a foreign securities firm says, it gives the perception that there is some form of continuity. in the short term, with this new reorganisation, there will definitely be uncertainty, which will distract management time and potentially, they may lose some business. this is the groups third major reorganisation since a restructuring in 2005 gave birth to the second largest banking group in the country. cimb last embarked on one in 2011, when the group management committee led by nazir was narrowed to 15 from 21. similarities between the current revamp and the one in 2011 are that the exercises resulted in the group ceo holding more than one function. as a result of the revamp in september 2011, nazir held dual roles of group ceo and head of the malaysian consumer bank. he was also involved in investment banking. in the current reorganisation, zafrul will be acting ceo of the group and will also assume the post of ceo of wholesale banking. we will recalibrate many things in 2015, then have three full years to accelerate based on those stronger foundations to reach our targets for 2018. the t18 initiatives are focused on streamlining to get our cost structure right, focusing on priority areas where we have traditionally under-punched and strengthening the organisation culture, zafrul said of the t18 strategy. we have grown aggressively over the years and have a fantastic platform and brand. however, we have weaknesses and we can no longer depend on a high-growth operating environment. the strategic review has been about identifying areas where we are but should not be, areas where we need to be better and areas where we are already strong. these form the basis of an action plan to get us to our targets for 2018, which will no doubt require some near-term sacrifices, he added.  note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score

prove itself after deia approval", "article": " while investors have responded positively to the approval of the detailed environmental impact assessment (deia) study for benalec holdings bhds reclamation works for the tanjung piai integrated petroleum & petrochemical hub project, the group still has to prove itself by securing offtakers for its land sales. this is positive for the company, having waited so long [for the approval]. it gives legitimacy to the tanjung piai project, and now they (benalec) can approach clients that its the real deal. without the approval, clients may not want to commit, even to pricing, as there isnt any certainty, says a fund manager. theyve got a good deal, the onus is now on them to prove it to secure the clients, he adds, noting that obtaining approval for the study was the hardest obstacle. the project is expected to provide benalec (fundamental: 1.65; valuation: 1.2) with earnings visibility for the next 10 to 15 years. to recap, benalec announced last week that the report  submitted jointly by its 70%-owned subsidiary spektrum kukuh sdn bhd and state secretary, johor inc  was officially approved on jan 23. the approval is valid for two years from the date of the department of environments letter of approval. the study was submitted last october following objections from residents who were concerned that the project would damage the forest and fishing grounds in the area. according to its announcement to bursa malaysia, benalec will commence work on phase 1 of the project in february, which will include the construction of an oil terminal, a jetty and a bridge linking the island to the mainland, and dredging. the 1,410.33ha (3,485 acres) tanjung piai project comprises a man-made island to be sited off the southwestern coast of johor. this is the second major approval for land reclamation works in johor after country garden pacific view sdn bhds 1,368ha forest city development just two weeks ago. an offtake agreement, which is usually negotiated prior to the construction of a facility, seeks to secure a market or purchaser for the future output of the facility, thus making it easier to obtain financing to construct the facility. in terms of funding, kenanga research believes that benalec will fund phase 1  estimated at 1,000 acres  through the groups recent issuance of rm200 million in convertible bonds last september. based on a reclamation cost of rm30 per sq ft (10% higher than malaccas average reclamation cost), for every 100 acres of land reclamation in tanjung piai, the group needs to fork out rm130.7 million. hence, we believe that benalec will be actively looking for potential offtaker(s) for the initial 100 acres that are soon to be reclaimed to sustain its cash flow, says kenanga research analyst iqbal zainal in a jan 28 report. as at sept 30, 2014, benalec had net cash of rm47.78 million, after deducting borrowings of rm14.87 million. with 173 acres of land worth rm312 million for sale, and the rm203.9 million coastal reclamation contract from oriental boon siew (m) sdn bhd in may last year, benalec said it will have a stable revenue stream of about rm515 million for fy2015 to fy2017. analysts see benalec inking the 1,000-acre land sales with 1my strategic terminal oil  the binding term sheet which has been extended four times since march 2013 to june 11, 2015  as sizeable and a rerating catalyst for the stock. kenanga research estimates that the group could fetch a total revenue of rm2.2 billion, with a selling price of rm50 psf, over four to five years. based on the groups historical net margin of 30% from its land sales, this could translate into rm660 million in net profit over five years, or rm132 million per year. meanwhile, cimb research estimates that benalec could gain rm566 million in net profit over five years, based on a rm52 psf average reclamation cost and a rm65 psf selling price, hence a rm13 psf surplus value. based on these estimates, benalec could surpass even its highest net profit of rm96.1 million for fy2011. for the first quarter ended sept 30, 2014, benalec reported a net profit of rm14.17 million, compared with a net loss of rm4.66 million in the previous quarter. its revenue also more than tripled to rm47.93 million from rm14.1 million, most of which were from land disposals. the fund manager opines that the demand for tanjung piai is there, and its just a matter of pricing. he adds that the project could garner a little more premium compared with asia petroleum hubs man-made island due to its close proximity to jurong. however, with 1my strategic terminal oil, as 1,000 acres is a big chunk, the pricing might be lower. also, at that point of discussion (back in 2013), the price point could be higher as costs were higher u2026 now, both parties might need to renegotiate, he says. meanwhile, another analyst says benalec need not rush to obtain offtakers at one go, as the project spans 10 to 15 years. it all depends on whether benalec is willing to compromise its pricing. amresearch, which maintains its buy call on benalec with a fair value of rm1.25, believes that the real litmus test for benalec starts now. undeniably, tanjung piais deepwater depth and close proximity to the jurong petrochemical hub put it in a prime position to tap into spillover demand for oil storage from the various multinational corporations that are currently operating in singapore, analyst mak hoy ken says in a jan 28 report. kenanga research maintains its outperform call with a target price of 83 sen, implying a price-earnings ratio of 10.3 times fy2015 earnings per share. affin hwang capital, while maintaining its target price of 74 sen, has downgraded its call from buy to hold, citing the rebound in benalecs share price from a low of 53 sen. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the

valuation: 2.1) held an analyst meeting last wednesday and shared that its 4q2014 and 1q2015 results will likely show a spike in provisions and that there will be a group-wide spring cleaning (see accompanying story).  on the same day, cimb released the fy2014 ended dec 31 results of its 93.71%-owned subsidiary cimb thai pcl. net profit was down 33.6% to thb988.8 million, gross npls stood at thb6.4 billion and the gross npl ratio was at 3.3%, up from 2.5% as at dec 31, 2013. the increase in npls was mainly due to economic disruptions, which affected the borrowers repayment ability and an increase in certain sizeable corporate accounts and retail segments, cimb noted in a statement last wednesday. tough banking this year  the tell-tale signs of a challenging environment for banks emerged in the september quarter of last year with half of the eight listed malaysian banking groups  cimb, affin holdings bhd (fundamental: 1.10; valuation: 2.10), malayan banking bhd (fundamental: 1.50; valuation: 1.30) and rhb capital bhd (fundamental: 1.50; valuation: 2.10)  registering lower year-on-year quarterly earnings. interestingly, for the cumulative nine months ended sept 30, 2014, three of the five banks that saw lower earnings were affin, maybank and cimb. public bank bhd (fundamental: 2.8; valuation: 1.2) and rhb stood out from the crowd, registering year-on-year net profit growth of 7.4% and 15.5% to rm3.296 billion and rm1.56 billion respectively. meanwhile, banking analysts have started to cut their earnings projections for the industry. uob kay hian research, in a jan 6 note, acknowledges that there is a potential risk of earnings disappointment. we are projecting aggregate fy2014 and fy2015 earnings growth of 1.9% and 7.8% for the banking stocks under our coverage. we see an earnings downside risk in both consensus and our earnings recovery expectations for 2015 because much of it is premised on relatively stronger investment banking non-interest income growth recovery, which remains uncertain given the current volatile capital market condition. in addition, we are only at the early stage of an upward reversal in the provision cycle, it notes. the sector will continue to be plagued by slower-than-expected loan growth, persistent net interest margin compression and pockets of npl stress translating into earnings disappointment. the sharp drop in oil prices will contribute to slower corporate loan growth. in contrast to earlier expectations, the implementation of the base rate, which replaces the base lending rate, did not have the intended effect of alleviating yield pressure on consumer loans. in a jan 13 note, affin hwang research note says it maintains its neutral rating on the malaysian banking sector, given concerns of cascading macro risks for the economy from 4q2014 to 2q2015, ranging from concerns of defaults in the commodity-related industries, the risk of a major scaling down of government projects and worries of foreign selldown on malaysian bonds. for sector exposure, we favour public bank and hong leong bank bhd (fundamental: 2.8;

flags that are affecting the economy globally that may have repercussions for the malaysian economy. we must stay omniscient of the reality that is hitting us, and the speed of which it is happening. who would have thought that in a short period of time, crude oil prices have dropped to levels of us$50 (rm178) per barrel [from about us$115 per barrel in june 2014], and our ringgit has depreciated to a level not seen since the asian financial crisis [in 1997 and 1998], he said in his keynote address at the affin hwang capital conference series 2015 yesterday. daim was addressing a roomful of investment bankers, analysts, fund managers as well as members of the press on the current economic situation in the country which he labelled as the elephant in the room, but reiterated prime minister datuk seri najib razaks stance that the country is not in a crisis. we are not in a crisis, but we cannot deny that we are in turbulent times. it will be foolish and nearsighted to deal with these turbulent times using unconvincing responses; we must think out of the box and resist conventional approaches, and make decisions that are strategic and have a long-lasting effect, said daim. the former finance minister stressed the importance of transparency in a time of turbulence. when i was the executive director of the national economic action council, as part of the national [economic] recovery plan, we knew the importance of enhancing domestic and international confidence through the release of timely, coordinated and accurate economic data which restored investor confidence and enhanced transparency, said daim. he also called on the government to be more transparent in the dealings of sovereign wealth fund 1malaysia development bhd (1mdb), which is wholly owned by the ministry of finance, and said the rakyat have the right to question the dealings of the fund. there are so many confusing statements on 1mdb and [the status of its finances]. if it is doing well, why isnt it paying its debts? why is so much money borrowed? the rakyat want to know [the answers to these questions], and i think there is no harm to being truthful. let us be honest, the more you try to hide, the more people become suspicious, daim said. he added that 1mdbs debt was one of the factors causing the weakening of the ringgit, stating that the sovereign funds debt had caused uncertainty in the domestic economy. it is difficult to say when exactly the ringgit will stabilise, as its [fluctuation] is tied to many things. 1mdb is one of the factors that causes uncertainty [in the economy] as its [debts] are big. its [estimated debt] is at [some] rm40 billion, daim told reporters after his keynote address. the ringgit was traded at 3.5805 against the us dollar at about noon yesterday. this compared with 3.1415 in august 2014. the edge financial daily (tefd), quoting sources, reported last friday that based on auditors feedback given to bank negara malaysia, the rm2 billion loan extended to 1mdb by several banks, was likely to be categorised as a non-performing loan (npl) by the lenders. malayan banking bhd (fundamental:1.50; valuation: 1.30) and rhb capital bhd (fundamental:1.50; valuation: 2.10) are the lead lenders with 58.99% and 32.41% respectively of the rm2 billion loan. the other lenders are alliance investment bank bhd (4.06%), malaysia building society bhd (fundamental: 1.20; valuation: 2.40) (3.24%) and hwangdbs investment bhd (1.29%), tefd reported. tefd also reported that the lenders were expected to revert on whether to officially declare the loan a default by feb 18. daim opined that 1mdbs loan should be categorised as a npl. i think it is time the loan be recognised as a npl, as they (1mdb) have been given extensions by the banks for the loan, and it is difficult to understand why they cannot settle the loan as they have already redeemed the funds [from the cayman islands], said daim. however, according to a recent news report by singapores business times, 1mdb executive director arul kanda kandasamy said 1mdb had no plans to repatriate the us$1.103 billion (rm3.95 billion) redeemed from its investments in the cayman islands. arul said the money would be used to service interest payments on 1mdbs us dollar-denominated debts. on the banking sectors role in turbulent times, daim said banks need to be financially strong and well-capitalised to weather the tough times. when i was the finance minister, i pushed for consolidation in the banking industry so as to avoid a financial crisis. our financial sector needs to be adequately capitalised and effectively supervised, he said. he added that the recent failed merger among cimb group holdings bhd (fundamental: 1.8; valuation: 1.8), rhb capital bhd and malaysia building society bhd should not hinder future consolidation efforts in the banking industry, as the country needs stronger banks to compete globally. the edge researchs

direction unclear", "article": " last week, puncak niaga holdings bhds shareholders approved the sale of its water concession business, which will bring in rm1.56 billion cash for the group. its exit from selangors water concession segment will enable the group to diversify and expand, which may excite investors in the coming months. but risks linger because puncaks board has yet to determine how it will invest the rm1 billion it received from the sale of water treatment operator puncak niaga sdn bhd (pnsb)  the groups breadwinner  and distributor syarikat bekalan air selangor sdn bhd. analysts say they cannot predict the groups prospects because it might take years to meet the 50% shortfall in earnings. at puncaks egm last wednesday, executive chairman tan sri rozali ismail reiterated the groups intention to venture into the plantation sector while remaining in the water, wastewater and environment engineering business and bolstering its oil and gas division. however, he did not commit to a concrete plan on how puncak was going to spend the cash earmarked for investment. a minority shareholder who attended the egm told the edge that he was undecided whether to keep the stock after the group has made its rm1 per share dividend disbursement. i will have to wait and see what puncak niaga announces [on its business plan]. rozali assured the shareholders that puncak would be careful about its investments. it took the group nearly a year to finalise the sale of selangor-related water concessions, he explained, as it had to get proper valuations and assessments done on the likely impact of the sale on the groups operations. in june last year, rozali agreed in principle to put an end to a six-year battle for control of selangors water assets between the private concessionaires and the state government. in november, a deal was formally tabledat rm1.56 billion cash. acquirer pengurusan air selangor sdn bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of state investment arm kumpulan darul ehsan bhd, is only taking over the states concessions and will allow puncak to keep its other water businesses, such as its concessions in china and its construction arm. after the sale agreement, which is [expected] to be completed on jan 16, we will have more time to look at investment opportunities, rozali told reporters after the egm before joking that the group was previously busy tending to complaints about water service in selangor. he also revealed that the group has made overtures to plantation companies with assets in malaysia. currently, puncak is evaluating the potential investment returns and valuations of these assets. with crude palm oil (cpo) price expected to soften further this year, the value of plantation estates will go down in tandem. our top priority is to look at oil palm estates in malaysia. over the past year, spot cpo price has dropped nearly 8% to rm2,316.50 per tonne. however, analysts are doubtful about puncaks decision to penetrate the sector, citing unattractive prospects and the groups lack of expertise in the field. cimb research plantation analyst ivy ng lee fang tellsthe edgethat if puncak wants immediate earnings contribution from its plantation venture, it needs to acquire assets that are well managed. as for buying opportunities, it might find them in sabah and sarawak. some assets have been acquired there over the past few years and the prices are cheaper too. she points out two recent notable acquisitions there: ioi corp bhds rm1 billion purchase of unico-desa plantations bhd and felda global ventures holdings bhds takeover of pontian united plantations bhd for rm1.22 billion. the estates of both the targeted companies are predominantly in sabah. nevertheless, rozali has said puncak will not put all its eggs in one basket. so, it is anyones guess how much the group will spend on plantation assets. but according to ng, rm1 billion acquisitions will only make the entity a small planter. unico-desas net profit for its financial year ended march 31, 2013 (fy2013)  its final full year before it was acquired  was rm25.47 million while revenue was rm166.91 million. pnsbs latest audited normalised profit after tax for its fy2013 ended dec 31 was about eight times larger at rm234.37 million while revenue was rm684.41 million. another wild card is puncaks future acquisitions in the oil and gas sector. with crude oil prices down more than 50% since last year, there is no telling how the sector will fare, especially if oil producers cut their spending. rozali, however, remains unfazed because puncaks wholly-owned oil and gas subsidiary is involved in the service sector. when oil prices drop, the companies dont look at investing in exploration and production but they will continue to do maintenance and servicing so that they can maintain their assets, he observed. according to rhb research institute, puncak oil & gas sdn bhd owns a derrick lay barge and has secured package b of the pan malaysia integrated offshore installation contract worth rm1.8 billion for three years from 2014 to 2016. alliancedbs research analyst arhnue tan agrees with rozali that oil and gas service providers are shielded from falling oil prices because their contracts are locked in advance. however, she remarks that a recent report that petroliam nasional bhd plans to cut its operational expenditure by up to 30% does not bode well for service players as well. this will result in a slowdown in activity. another analyst comments that this could be an opportune time for puncak to accumulate oil assets as they might be priced lower or there could be consolidation ahead to ride out the storm. rozali also told reporters that the group will remain in the water business and that it had talked to several asean members on providing its services. but as amresearch analyst max koh points out, puncaks concessions in china are still loss-making. still, another analyst says the stock will remain attractive until the ex-date for the bumper dividend of rm1 per share. on a fully diluted basis, the rm534.3 million earmarked for special dividend will translate into a 35.5% yield on the stocks close of rm2.82 last thursday. where else can you find a yield as big as that? asks the analyst. rozali admitted that he was happy with the payout. after all, he owns 169.12 million shares or a 40.86% stake in puncak.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on january 12 - 18 , 2015."}, "546": {"date_posted": "6/2/2015", "title": "management

chart sell on ioi properties group bhd. ioi properties released its first quarter of financial year 2015 (1qfy15) results at the end of november 2014 and is expected to announce its 2qfy15 results sometime late this month. it has three main operating divisions which contribute towards the groups operating profit in 1qfy15. these divisions are property development which contributes approximately 83%, property investment which chips in about 11%, while leisure and hospitality and others make up the remaining 6%. in the results announcement, ioi properties revenue rose by about 34% year-on-year (y-o-y) to rm375 million for 1qfy15 from rm280 million in 1qfy14, while profit before tax expanded correspondingly by 12.8% y-o-y to rm150 million in 1qfy15 from rm133 million in 1qfy14. according to ioi properties announcement, the improved profitability was attributed to positive contributions from all its operating segments. going forward, ioi properties pointed out that the malaysian property sector remains challenging with tighter financial criteria by banks on loan approvals. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that eight research houses cover ioi properties, of which there are six hold calls and two buy calls. this stock currently trades at a low price-earnings ratio of 6.7 times while its price-to-book value ratio of 0.62 times indicates that its share price is trading at a huge discount to its book value. ioi properties chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly down. its share price has made a large decline since its all-time high of rm3.36 on jan 15, 2014. since that rm3.36 high, ioi properties fell to its all-time low of rm2.06 in january 2015. as prices broke below their recent key critical support levels of rm2.45 and rm2.27, look to sell ioi properties on any rebounds to its resistance areas as the mas depict very firm short- to long- term downtrends for this stock. the daily and weekly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) have issued sell signals and now depict very firm indications of ioi properties eventual move towards much lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance

together point to a strong possibility that the proposed banking mega merger of cimb group holdings bhd, rhb capital bhd and malaysia building society bhd (mbsb) could be called off, sources familiar with the deal say. the economic landscape today is so different from what it was when the merger was first announced in july last year. circumstances have changed so much that it has come to a point where the merger may not be palatable for the parties involved. they are currently accessing the situation, says a source. two separate sources say there is a strong chance the merger wont happen based on current indications from key parties. one of the reasons is that rhb is seeking a revision of the terms, having seen how substantially cimbs share price has fallen since the merger was first proposed last july. instead of an all-share deal, rhb now wants shares and cash for its merger with cimb. this means cimb has to put up more cash and valuations will go up, so the deal may no longer be feasible to cimb, one of the sources tells the edge. added to that is the fact that the economic situation, both at home and the region, has turned more challenging since the merger was proposed, the source adds. cimb, the more regional player of the three, has seen its financial performance suffer the most in recent quarters, mainly because of the tougher operating landscape in indonesia. given the economic situation, the depreciating ringgit and problems in indonesia, the dynamics are now such that its just a bad time to go into a merger, especially one where the pricing is not that cheap, the source remarks. in mid-december 2014, the edge, citing sources, reported that the due diligence undertaken for the merger had showed up provisioning issues that could also affect valuations. the sources hadpointed out that mbsb did not come within the purview of bank negara malaysia up until the financial services act was enforced in 2013 and as such, the non-bank lender applied a different provisioning standard for many years from the two other banking groups involved in the merger. meanwhile, another source familiar with the deal says given the current operating landscape, the merger is unlikely to achieve the desired synergies, estimated at over rm1 billion. when the modelling was done for the proposed merger, it was done based on certain assumptions but the market has changed so much since then. for example, the aspired revenue that the merger wants to achieve is looking tough to achieve now given the current operating landscape. loans growth has gone down, margin compression is worse than the industry thought and asset quality could be worse than what the industry expects, says the source. from the cost synergies point of view, think about it, how many people would take up a vss (voluntary separation scheme) in this current market environment? surely people will think twice before accepting it. in a normal market environment, the take-up rate of a vss is about 60% to 70% u2026 but would that rate be the same in the current environment? the source adds. on top of these factors, there is also the falling stock price of cimb. the edge had on nov 3 written that if the divergence in share prices were to continue, it could lead to a recalibration of the relative values of the three entities. cimbs stock has shed 24.2% to rm5.29 last thursday since the structure of the mega merger was first announced on oct 9. rhbs has fallen 13.7% to rm7.51 over the same period, while mbsbs has risen 3.8% to rm2.46. last thursday, bloomberg reported, citing sources, that the terms of the merger between cimb and rhb could be renegotiated following the tumble in cimbs share price. industry observers say should the merger plans fall through, an alternative potential buyer could emerge for rhb. rhb did catch the eye of a few potential suitors, including maybank. so if the merger is off the table, it is possible that others may make a move on it, says an industry observer. according to another source, long-talked-about plans for a merger between rhb and mbsb may be re-explored. the parties may rope in a smaller islamic outfit into the mix, the person says. as it stands, the proposed cimb-rhb-mbsb mergerhas been structured such that rhb will acquire cimbs assets and liabilities via a share swap at an exchange ratio of 1.38 (one rhb share for every 1.38 cimb share). this is based on a benchmark price of rm7.27 per cimb share and rm10.03 per rhb share, translating into a price-to-book value (p/bv) ratio of 1.7 times and 1.44 times for cimb and rhb respectively. their islamic operations, which will then come under cimb islamic bank, will then acquirembsb to form a mega islamic bank, at a price of rm7.77 billion or rm2.82 per share. this translates into a p/bv of 1.32 times and mbsb shareholdershave a choice to either accept cash or new shares in the unlisted cimb islamic group.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia

grip on ytl corp bhd, ytl power international bhd and ytl land & development bhd, at a time when the share prices of the three companies were falling. within the sprawling business empire of the ytl group, there are five listed vehicles: ytl corp, ytl power, ytl land, ytl hospitality reit and ytl e-solutions bhd. ytl corp, one of the largest conglomerates in malaysia, is the parent company of the other four, with a 49.88% direct stake in ytl power, 65.26% in ytl land, 56.44% in ytl reit and 74.12% in ytl e-solutions (see chart).  some notable share transactions were made last december, namely ytl corp mopping up shares in ytl power and ytl land, and the yeoh family accumulating shares in ytl corp. it is worth noting that last year, ytl power and ytl land saw their share prices fall 10.4% and 16% respectively. ytl corps share price had also fallen 4% from a 52-week high of rm1.662 on may 21. research analysts who cover the ytl stocks tell the edge that attractive valuation and positive outlook for the companies dividend payments could have led to the yeoh familys move. a financial analyst, who tracks the yeoh family closely, opines that purchasing more shares of these companies as prices declined could be perceived as a value buy for them. if the yeoh family doesnt support the share prices, they might fall further. as the family members are sitting on the board, they should know the intrinsic value (of these companies) better than third-party investors, he says. tiong lay, 84, the patriarch of the yeoh family, is the executive chairman of ytl corp and ytl power. his eldest son tan sri francis yeoh sock ping is the managing director of ytl corp, ytl power and ytl land, and all his six siblings are on the boards of ytl corp and ytl power. the analyst adds that at ytl power, the yeoh family members have been actively converting their warrants into mother shares, while ytl corp has been buying back more shares in the utility group. no businessmen will do that unless they know they will receive something in return. minority shareholders are likely to benefit from this kind of situation, he says. another equity analyst from a local investment bank concurs, adding that the low share prices provided the opportunity for the yeoh family to raise its stakes in these companies. if we look at the price-to-book value (p/bv), their shares are undervalued, he says. a check on bloomberg shows that ytl corp was traded at an average p/bv of 1.39 times in the financial year ended june 30, 2013 (fy2013), before it dropped to 1.26 times in fy2014. the counter is currently traded at 1.17 times. similarly, the p/bv of ytl power had fallen from 2.3 times in fy2011 to 1.55 times in fy2012 and 1.25 times in fy2013. it is currently traded at 0.96 times. meanwhile, ytl lands p/bv had declined from 2.04 times in fy2011, 1.62 times in fy2012 0.85 times in fy2013 to 0.82 times in fy2014. the stock is currently traded at 0.63 times. to recap, ytl corp had purchased close to 70 million ytl power shares last month. the yeoh siblings have also converted at least 49 million warrants to ytl power shares since early october. the derivatives will only expire in 2018, thus raising the question of what prompted them to convert the warrants now. although ytl corp owned directly and indirectly 57.76% in ytl power as at sept 26, 2014, its latest shareholding is 56.78%, despite the buying. this is due to the dilutive effect of the warrant conversion. on dec 2, ytl corp purchased a 7.37% stake in ytl land, raising its stake to 65.26% from 57.89%. this was the first time ytl corp had bought ytl land shares since april 2011. meanwhile, yeoh tiong lay & sons holdings sdn bhd, the private investment vehicle of the yeoh family, had on dec 18 bought 93.1 million shares in ytl corp, raising its stake from 48.66% to 49.56%. the family had not accumulated any shares in ytl corp since october 2012. interestingly, the management of ytl corp has been holding back on paying out dividends for more than two decades as its various units needed cash to expand their businesses or for mergers and acquisitions. however, with the rm14 billion consolidated cash that ytl

as the employees provident fund (epf) and permodalan nasional bhd (pnb) have been scooping up local equities, capitalising on the weak market sentiment caused by fresh concern about the countrys economy amid falling crude oil prices and the weaker ringgit. when contacted, areca capital sdn bhd chief executive officer danny wong, said fallen local equity prices have presented a buying opportunity for government-linked funds. he noted that only during such weak market sentiment that large institutional funds could acquire a sizeable number of shares without triggering a rally in stock prices. taking a pension fund as an example, when the market is on an uptrend, its hard to collect sizeable shares, without further boosting its prices, he said. according to data compiled by the edge financial daily, the epf had, from jan 1 to jan 27, 2015, recorded substantial net purchases of shares in beaten down oil and gas companies, namely sapurakencana petroleum bhd (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.8), bumi armada bhd (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 0.6) and dialog group bhd (fundamental: 0.7; valuation: 1.7). (see table) it also recorded substantial net purchases of shares in banking groups cimb group holdings bhd (fundamental: 2.1; valuation: 1.35) and bimb holdings bhd (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 1.8). also in the same period, pnb recorded substantial net purchases of shares in government-linked companies (glcs) such as sime darby bhd (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.3), umw holdings bhd (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 2.2), telekom malaysia bhd (fundamental: 0.9; valuation: 1.1) and tenaga nasional bhd [tnb] (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.8). fund managers said these purchases reflected the funds confidence in the long-term prospects of the said major corporations, despite the temporary blip in some of their business operations. for instance, sapurakencana, which also recorded net purchases of shares by pnb in january, besides epf, saw its share price decline sharply since last october, tumbling from about rm4.10 to a low of rm2.10 in december, in line with the sharp drop in global oil prices. nevertheless, with recent purchases by local institutions such as the epf and pnb, the stock has rebounded to about rm2.80 recently. from jan 1 to 27, epf and pnb had recorded net purchases of some 37.46 million shares and seven million shares respectively in sapurakencana. meanwhile, among the top net purchases by epf was cimb, in which the retirement fund recorded a net purchase of 25.05 million shares during the jan 1 to 27 period. cimbs share price recovered somewhat after news came out on jan 14 on the cancellation of the tripartite merger involving the group, rhb capital bhd (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 2.1) and malaysia building society bhd (fundamental: 2.4; valuation: 1.2). the banking group had seen a sharp drop in its share price since it unveiled the merger structure on oct 9 last year, due to market concerns over the viability of the exercise. hence, following the cancellation of the deal, interests in the stock had been revived to a certain extent. the epf is the second largest shareholder of cimb with total holding of 1.27 billion shares or a 15.13% equity interest. pnb, on the other hand, had also taken the opportunity to increase its stakes in glcs such as telekom by 1.25%, and in tnb by 0.56% during the jan 1 to 27 period. through its trust fund amanahraya trustees bhd-skim amanah saham bumiputera, pnb is the third largest shareholder of both corporations, with some 12.64% stake in telekom and an 8.43% stake in tnb. pnb capitalised on the drop in share prices of both entities at the beginning of the month to increase its shareholdings. for instance, it purchased a block of 15.63 million shares representing a 0.42% stake in telekom on jan 5 when the stock was trading at levels of rm6.81. telekom shares closed at rm6.99 last friday. similarly, tnb shares which closed at rm14.50 last friday, were trading at levels of rm13.74 to rm13.80 at the beginning of the month (jan 2 to 7), with pnb snapping up 18.07 million shares during the period, representing a 0.32% stake in the utility giant. unlike foreign funds, the weaker ringgit is not a cause for concern for local funds when investing in local equities, said wong. (the ringgit was traded at rm3.64 against the us dollar as at time of writing). when foreign funds exit local equities partly due to concerns of the ringgit, local long-term funds may take advantage to accumulate. [and when the] foreign funds do return to local equities, it will be the local institutions turn to take profit; its quite a normal cycle for emerging markets, he said. according to a report by maybank ib research on jan 29, bursa malaysias fund flow data showed that foreign investors had net sold rm2.4 billion worth of malaysian equities since early this year until jan 22, adding on to a net sale of rm6.9 billion in 2014. rhb research institute head of research alexander chia said that government-linked funds with long-term investment horizons typically tend to choose stocks that possess sound fundamentals, decent market liquidity, high corporate governance standards, good growth prospects and attractive yields. over the years, the growing size of these funds and their need to buy on market weakness have earned the malaysian market a reputation for being defensive and low beta, as these funds are perceived to be supporting the market. however, this perception is somewhat unfair as it is very much a function of the size of their funds, said chia.   the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers. a score of 3 suggests strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. go to www.theedgemarkets.com for more details on a companys financial dashboard.   this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on february 4, 2015."}, "553": {"date_posted": "28/1/2015", "title": "ghl system share price climbs on partnership with global payments ", "article": " kuala lumpur (jan 28): electronic payment solutions provider ghl system bhds share price climbs today, after it signed a transaction payment acquisition (tpa) arrangement with global payments malaysia. at 3.30pm, the stock gained 9.15% or seven sen to 83.5 sen, with 19 million shares changing hands. it is one of the actively-traded counters today. ghl systems (fundamental: 1.40; valuation: 0.30) said in an announcement with bursa malaysia yesterday, that its wholly-owned subsidiaries ghl cardpay sdn bhd and ghl epayments sdn bhd have each entered into an agreement with global payments malaysia. ghls subsidiaries would act as payment facilitator (pf) and payment service provider (psp) for global payments malaysia. they have an initial target to acquire 3,000 to 4,000 merchants this year. meanwhile, in a note today, cimb research said the announcement did not come as a complete surprise; it was nevertheless a relief that ghl has finally secured the agreement, after recent delays. we understand that given gpms partnership with hsbc bank malaysia, the bank will act as a local clearinghouse for the payment transaction, as required by bank negara. thus, ghl can officially begin its merchant acquisition process, and start generating revenue from merchant discount rates and terminal rental from the smaller third- and fourth-tier merchants, it said. cimb research has projected 10,000 merchants will sign up for its tpa service in 2015, mainly driven from malaysia and the philippines which is expected to reach over 9,000 merchants, while there will be minimal growth from thailand. the research house has an add rating on ghl shares, as it thinks the companys growth prospect is intact and cimb reserach is confident of execution strategy.

furthermore, the index climbed above the top band of the bollinger bands indicator and this indicates a strong bullish momentum in the short term. however, after two weeks of increase, the market may attract sellers to book short-term profits and hence we may see some resistance. the bullish momentum is expected to continue but the market may face some short-term resistance. once the market corrects in the short term (which may take a few days), we expect the index to continue climbing higher with a possibility of the index testing the long-term 200-day ma. the chances would be higher for the fbm klci to continue its bullish momentum if it can stay above the broken resistance level at 1,765 points.   benny lee is chief market strategist for jupiter securities sdn bhd. jupiter

already tight margins this year as the upcoming goods and services tax (gst) and weaker ringgit are likely to add to cost pressure, said analysts. this is because it is unlikely that automotive players could raise prices and pass on additional costs to car buyers, with the heightened competition in the market and the tightening of loan criteria by banks. as it is, automotive players have already been forced to throw out promotions and discounts in what is seen to be a prelude to a possible price war.  ta securities research analyst angeline chin told the edge financial daily that automotive players, especially in the most affordable a segment (mini cars) and b segment (sub-compact cars), would risk further margin erosion to keep their market share. competition is already heating up. to vigorously defend market share, we expect more discounts and promotions to be given to lure buyers, she said in an email. midf research analyst annuar rahman told the edge financial daily that competition could pick up this year, especially post-gst. while most car manufacturers indicated that there would be some downward adjustment in prices, the softer demand as a result of the gst imposition could see competition increasing, he said. players such as umw holdings bhd (fundamental: 2.2; valuation: 1.2) and tan chong motor holdings bhd (fundamental: 0.8; valuation: 1.8) could also see their margins coming under pressure as a result of the higher us dollar apart from competition, he said. umw carries the toyota brand, while tan chong is the distributor of nissan vehicles. chin agreed that umw would be hit by the stronger greenback as the bulk of its purchases are in us dollar. the weakening ringgit is worrying and it may drive up the price of imported spare parts, she wrote in her report dated jan 22. meanwhile, annuar said he would not rule out a further tightening of lending requirements by bank negara malaysia to contain the level of household indebtedness. given the industry headwinds, most analysts have kept a neutral rating for the automotive sector this year, citing a lack of exciting near-term catalysts. the effects of these headwinds were already felt as early as the last quarter of 2014, when automotive players reported lower operating profit in their latest quarterly financial results compared with the same quarter in the previous year. we maintain our neutral stance on the sector as we believe that the sector is fairly valued and has limited rerating catalysts, said affin hwang investment bank bhd research analyst ong boon leong in a report dated jan 22. ongs sentiment was also shared by annuar in his sector update report, saying we believe earnings risks are largely priced in. despite the challenging operating environment, analysts still see some worthy pickings, like mbm resource bhd (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 1.2) and berjaya auto bhd (fundamental: 2.35; valuation: 0.9) that may perform reasonably well, if not better than expectations. midfs annuar sees potential positive in the turnaround of mbm resourcess alloy-rim business, oriental metal industries (m) sdn bhd, which should see higher utilisation rate. he also noted that mbm resources may see stronger contributions from its associate companies, perusahaan otomobil kedua sdn bhd (perodua) and hino motors manufacturing (m) sdn bhd, despite weaker earnings recorded last year due to start-up costs from new manufacturing facilities. perodua is expected to see strong sales from the new perodua axia and the recently-launched perodua myvi facelift, said annuar, who recommended a buy on mbm resources with a target price of rm4.80. mbm resources is also maybank investment bank research analyst ivan yaps top pick, given its more attractive valuations and exposure to the small-car segment via perodua. hence, yap too has a buy call on the stock, but with a lower tp of rm3.50. meanwhile, berjaya auto, which markets the mazda brand, is cimb investment bank research analyst azman hussins top pick for the sector. the firm, which he has an add call on, is expected to launch a slew of new models that will help sustain its strong growth trajectory this year, he said. kenanga research analyst desmond chong also thinks berjaya auto is the apparent winner in the automotive sector, due to the weakening yen against the ringgit as approximately 50% of its total costs is exposed to the yen. hence, chong has an outperform call on the stock with a tp of rm4.29. we expect the yen to stay soft, he said in a recent report, adding

[with] the sizewe have now, we can be significant and relevant to provide allthat we promised our customers, he said in august. when news of the mega-merger broke, there was intense speculation that maybank would join the fray and make a bid for rhb cap. after all, the largest bank in the country had competed head-to-head with cimb for rhb cap in 2011. however, both banks decided to walk away from rhb cap at the time because aabar investments pjs acquired the stake from abu dhabi commercial bank (adcb) at rm10.80 per share or 2.25 times book value. on aug 2, 2013, farid replaced datuk seri abdul wahid omar, who had resigned in june to take over as minister in the prime ministers department in charge of the economic planning unit. prior to that, the harvard business school alumni was deputy president and head of maybanks global wholesale banking. farid has over two decades of banking and finance experience and also worked at jp morgan and schroders and was a director of

now and has been involved in countless corporate deals. while he initiates and executes deals for his clients, ongs businesses have had their fair share of corporate exercises too. this year, the veteran banker made the headlines for two mega-mergers  one involving his interest in rhb cap and the other involving his property companies. just two years after ong sold his investment banking arm to rhb cap for rm2.09 billion (he was paid via a combination of cash and shares in the latter), he is back in the spotlight, thanks to the proposed merger between cimb, rhb cap and mbsb. with ong controlling osks 9.9% stake in rhb cap, he has a say in the mega-merger. following bursa malaysias decision to disallow the epf from voting on the merger, osk is the second-largest shareholder in rhb cap, after aabar, that will be voting on the merger. osk has yet to reveal its cards but its founder ong will be able to sniff out a lousy deal in a flash. while the banking and investment fraternity awaits the outcome of the mega-merger, ong is involved in a three-way merger between osk, osk property holdings bhd and pj development holdings bhd (pjd), which will create a first-tier property group.  jho lowceo, jynwel capital penangite low taek jho, better known as jho low, is still drawing attention despite spending less time in the country. this is because the 32-year-old continues to be involved in the local corporate world partly due to his strong middle-eastern connections. one of the more notable corporate deals which low was instrumental in facilitating was the entry of adcb into rhb capital bhd in 2008. at the time, adcb had paid rm7.20 per share for a 24.9% stake in rhb cap at a valuation of 2.2 times price to book. the stake was then sold to its sister company aabar investments for rm10.20 per share in 2012. with its current 21.2% interest in rhb cap, aabar has a say in the cimb-rhb cap-mbsb mega-merger. while low may not be directly involved in the deal, industry observers say he is very much behind the scenes, safeguarding the interests of his middle-eastern friends. the wharton alumni also made the headlines this year, thanks to his family investment vehicle jynwel capital. since 2012, jynwel has advised on investments of up to us$7 billion, say reports. this year alone, jynwel, together with abu dhabi government-linked funds, made an offer to adidas ag to buy the fitness brand reebok for u20ac1.7 billion, says the wall street journal. jynwel also made an offer to acquire london-listed salamander energy plc in october but recently decided not to pursue it . in 2009, low was involved in the setting-up of the terengganu investment authority, in which he served as an adviser. he left in mid-may 2009 and the prime minister

committee on oct 31. it wants a chance to plead its case via an oral presentation.  shahril has publicly shared his belief that the epf, as the major shareholder of both rhb cap and cimb, has the right to vote on the merger of the two banking groups. in making the epfs case, he said the retirement fund had the interest of 14 million members to protect and that it only wanted to vote on the merger between rhb cap and cimb. it will sit out the exercise involving mbsb. the epf owns 14.6% of cimb, 41.5% of rhb cap and 64.6% of mbsb. the 44-year-old shahril took over as ceo of the epf from

rhb capital bhd (rhbcap) and malaysia building society bhd (mbsb) last week, sending share prices of cimb and rhbcap higher as investors deemed the deal cancellation a prudent move amid a tougher economic environment. however, it would be hard to imagine that tycoon tan sri ong leong huat would be part of the cheering crowd. ong controls 41.08% of osk holdings bhd (oskh), which in turn owns 255.8 million shares or a 9.94% stake in rhbcap (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 2.1)  valued at rm2.6 billion based on the rm10.028 per share that rhbcap was priced in the mega-merger with cimb and mbsb. the market had anticipated that oskh (fundamental: 1.65; valuation: 1.2) would seek the opportunity to cash out from rhbcap once the mega merger is completed. the rationale being, as oskhs interests in rhbcap gets diluted in a much larger merged entity, it would be easier for it to unload all or a partial of its investments at a desirable price, said market observers. oskhs cost for the rhbcap shares came up to rm7.36. the company has got the shares as main payment consideration for selling its investment banking unit to rhbcap for rm1.95 billion in 2012. such a huge war chest, should oskh unload its investments in rhbcap, it would have come in handy for the group as it strives to build a larger business out of property development. indeed, ong would have factored in the potential cashing out of rhbcap to raise capital for his bigger ambition in the real estate sector. just three months after the cimb-rhbcap-mbsb deal was mooted in july 2014, ong in october initiated a deal to merge oskh with osk property holdings bhd and pj development holdings bhd (pjd)  two property outfits that he personally has stakes in. the property exercise would see oskh paying either cash or issuing new shares to osk property (fundamental: 2.3; valuation: 3) and pjds (fundamental: 2.6; valuation: 3) minority shareholders for their stakes, to form a large property development entity with a combined market capitalisation of over rm3.3 billion. but now that the mega bank merger deal is off; all eyes will be on oskhs decision on its 9.94% stake in rhbcap. according to industry sources, there is no holding period for oskh and it has the option to let go of the rhbcap shares at any time. ong might have some sort of verbal agreement to not sell everything in the open market. but other than that, theres nothing to really hold him back if he wants to let it go, one source told the edge financial daily. nevertheless, pricing remains the key. without an m&a exercise, it would be difficult for oskh to unload such a substantial stake in rhbcap at a desirable price. unfortunately, another m&a exercise is unlikely to happen in the banking industry at this juncture, says a banker. he pointed out that malaysian banks were expensive, with the acquirer often having to pay a premium, with arguably mediocre returns. for a local bank to acquire another local bank to gain market share, what would be the point if there was no synergy? all you would see is a lot of overlap in many areas, he said. of course, there is always a possibility of a m&a in the sector, but at this point, if banks are really looking for a value-accretive deal, its better to look regionally. acquiring banks outside malaysia is much cheaper. in the mean time, oskh would just have to contend itself with earning average dividends from its investment in rhbcap.  the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on

confirming the edge financial dailys reporton tuesday. cimb, in a letter, informed the other two banking groups yesterday that it had decided to abort the merger in light of the current economic conditions. we had thoroughly deliberated the merger, and while we remain convinced that the combination of our three franchises follows sound strategic logic, we ultimately were not able to arrive at a value-creating transaction for all stakeholders. the decision to cease discussions was arrived at after a detailed review of potential synergies that could be realistically delivered, especially in the current economic environment, cimbs acting group chief executive, tengku datuk zafrul aziz, said in a joint statement yesterday. accordingly, the three parties have ceased discussions. thiscomes six months after the proposed merger, which would have created the countrys largest banking group and a mega islamic bank, was first announced in july 2014. cimb and rhbcap said they had withdrawn a joint application to bank negara malaysia to seek approval for the merger. the three parties have also terminated the exclusivity agreement that they had entered into. this means, other parties that are speculated to be keen on exploring a merger with rhbcap, such as malayan banking bhd, can now approachthe former if they want to. cimb, in an internal memo to its staff on the aborted deal yesterday, said following the detailed discussions over the last few months and the shift in the economic outlook, the group had concluded that its ability to realise targeted merger synergies would be impacted. as such, it said there was no longer a compelling case for the merger to proceed. when the merger was first proposed last year, we had made certain assumptions based on the economic conditions and outlook that were reflective of the environment at that point in time. however, many of these assumptions needed to be revisited, with the major changes in economic environment, such as the significant change in oil prices and currency exchange rates, as well as the challenging outlook for the financial services industry, tengku zafrul said in the memo that was viewed by the edge financial daily. he went on to say that while he was disappointedthat the merger would not be realised cimb would move on with its own plans as it had not pinned all its hopes on the merger. in fact, we have been working very hard behind the scenes on our new mid-term strategy and roadmap to 2018, since we announced the strategic review last year. now that the merger is no longer proceeding, we are ready to start implementing our strategic plans, he said, adding that its strategy would involve key focus areas such as culture, productivity, transaction banking, islamic banking and small and medium enterprises. rhbcap group managing director kellee kam in a separate internal memo to staff said while the prospect of creating the countrys largest banking group was exciting, the changing economic environment and market conditions had created significant challenges for the group to be able to realise synergies. the group would not have been able to deliver a value-enhancing proposal to stakeholders, he said. part of the decision to terminate the discussions was also premised on the strong standalone proposition the rhb group brings to the table, he said. he said the group would now refocus its energy on accelerating its five-year transformation plan, known as ignite 2017. as for mbsb, it is understood that the non-bank lender will now continue with its efforts to become a bank. its president and ceo datuk ahmad zaini othman said the opportunity to be a part of a mega islamic bank had been an exciting one. given that the discussions have ceased, we can now continue to focus on the strength of our franchise and achieving the goals that we have originally set for ourselves, he said in a statement. the edge financial daily on tuesdayreported that an announcement on the mega merger being called off was expected before the end of the week. the edge weekly had in its jan 10 issue also reported that therewas a strong possibility the merger could be called offdue to several factors, including that the economic landscape had become more challenging compared to six months ago, making it a bad time to go into a merger of this size. another factor was that rhbcap was seeking a revision of the terms, having seen how substantially cimbs share price had fallen since the structure of the merger was first announced onoct 9last year. the report cited sources as saying that instead of an all-share deal in its merger with cimb, it now wanted a cash portion to be included, making a deal potentially more expensive for cimb. when met by reporters at an event early yesterday, cimb chairman datuk seri nazir razak said there was no change to the terms of the proposed deal. he saidthe due diligence exercise conducted for the proposed merger had been completed, and that the three parties were validating the business case of the merger. cimb shares closed down 17 sen at rm5.75 yesterday. rhbcap shares eased 15 sen to rm7.65, while mbsbs share price gained 10 sen to end

the blue-chip stock has gained around 7% this year to close at rm5 on dec 22, outperforming the fbm klcis x% decline. several short-term catalysts may drive the stock over the next five months, including an increase in revenue contribution from property sales as well as the klang valley mass rapid transit (kvmrt) line 1 construction project, which should improve investor sentiment in the stock after a year of market-beating gains. gamuda-wd, which expires on may 25, carries a strike price of rm2.66 and has a one-to-one conversion ratio. the warrant has gained about 10% this year to close at rm2.28 on dec 22, a modest 0.4% premium to the mother share. note that gamuda-wd continues to trade at near-zero premiums to its mother share, which indicates an active buying interest in the

theoretically be worth rm3.34 (rm6 less rm2.66), or a 46% upside, if the research houses fair value is reached. in a dec 17 note, maybank ib research analyst chai li shin says gamuda holds the advantage of having a strong balance sheet and recurring income from various concessions, which would mitigate the risks of a potential downturn in the economy. gamuda is our top pick for the construction sector as it is a major beneficiary of major infrastructure projects. the rm5 billion penang transport project is also a major catalyst for the group, which is a candidate for the project delivery partner (pdp) role. cimb research analyst sharizan rosely concurs, adding that other short to medium-term catalysts for gamuda include the signing of the pdp terms for the kvmrt line 2 project and the expected disposal of its 40%-owned syarikat pengeluar air sungai selangor sdn bhd (splash) to the selangor government. gamudas stock is down about 9% from its 52-week high of rm5.31

estimates, wrote cimb ibs analyst winson ng in a report dated jan 6. on tuesday, the edge financial daily reported that 1mdb had failed to repay the rm2 billion loan to local lenders due on dec 31, 2014. it quoted sources saying 1mdb was given until jan 30, 2015 to settle the debt that was originally due on nov 30, 2014. maybank and rhb capital bhd are the lead lenders of the loan. assuming the worst-case scenario, cimb ibs ng said a full impairment of maybanks loans to 1mdb would slash 56% of his estimated net profit for maybank in fy15 and cut the target price by about 44 sen to rm12.06. but he believes an impairment of the loan is unlikely to occur as it is guaranteed by the government of abu dhabi. furthermore, the loans would be settled if the sovereign wealth fund successfully lists its energy unit edra global energy bhd this year. hence, we do not see a high likelihood of full impairment of the loans, said ng. the maybank management declined to comment on its loan exposure to 1mdb, citing the banking secrecy act. a market observer said maybanks earnings will not be impacted at all as any impairment of the loan, if defaulted, is not likely to occur. the loan was due in november, but it was never impaired. then, it got extended to december, which was also never impaired. it (the repayment) will forever be due and forever never be impaired, she told the edge financial daily over the telephone. so, if it is never impaired, how will it impact the [maybank] financials? she said rhetorically. the market observer, however, warned that maybank could suffer in terms of investor sentiment on its stock, citing that there would be an overhang until the issue surrounding the 1mdb loan is resolved. meanwhile, pkr lawmaker wong chen told the edge financial daily that 1mdbs failure to repay its rm2 billion loans to rhbcap and maybank on time was very worrying. we wish to remind the government that the rakyat via the employees provident fund (epf), own substantial stakes in both rhbcap (41%) and maybank (14%). as such, 1mdb should not be given special national interest treatment and all dealings by the banks must be transparent and above board, he said. according to wong, legal proceedings should immediately proceed should 1mdb miss the new jan 30, 2015 deadline. considering the size of the loans, he urged maybank and rhbcap to publicly commit to this tough position to safeguard the reputation of the banking sector. we are also very worried about the damage this episode has on the expected march 2015 ipo (initial public offering) of 1mdb energy (now known as edra global energy). it sends a very negative perception of the viability of the ipo when the parent company cant get its financial act together, wong said, adding that 1mdb should immediately return the cayman island money and use that to pay off the rm2 billion debt. sources told the edge financial daily that the inability of 1mdb to meet its debt obligation on time showed how it is struggling with its cash flow. sources also said the matter was brought to the attention of bank negara malaysia, whereby 1mdb chairman tan sri lodin wok kamaruddin, director tan sri

tonne, are likely to get a lift in the near term as the current flood crisis negatively impacts the harvesting and processing of palm oil, said analysts. they said, however, the lower fourth-quarter earnings outlook should keep upside limited for planters share price in the short term. in a note dated dec 28, cimb investment bank bhd plantation analyst ivy ng lee fang sees the floods in the east coast reducing palm oil output, identifying felda global ventures holdings bhd (fgv), ioi corp bhd, sime darby bhd and kuala lumpur kepong bhd (klk) as planters with the highest estate exposure to the states impacted by the floods. we expect this event to lift cpo prices in the near term on concerns about palm oil supply. but the upside to cpo prices may be capped by worries over slower global growth, weak crude oil prices and higher soybean supplies, she said, projecting cpo prices to average at rm2,460 per tonne next year. however, ng noted that the rise in cpo price may not be sufficient to cover the loss in production from some of the estates impacted by the floods. as such, this news is negative for planters that are impacted by the floods. among the planters under our coverage, fgv currently has the highest proportion (67%) of estates located in the nine states that are reportedly hit by the floods. sime darby, ioi corp and klk have around 26% to 29% of their total oil palm estates located in these states, followed by genting plantations bhd with 14%, she said, maintaining a neutral rating on the plantation sector. ng said it is early days to assess the exact impact of the flooding on cpo output as this will be dependent on the severity and length of the ongoing monsoon. it was reported that the malaysian palmoilassociation had forecast cpo production to fall 21% in the dec 1 to 20 period compared with a month ago. onsept 2, cpo price hit its lowest in five years to rm1,914 per tonne, resulting in the government stepping in to temporarily waive the export levy until december, which has since been extended to end-february next year. since the temporary suspension, prices have rebounded. bloomberg reported that prices entered a bullish market onnov 3, after they rose more than 20% from rm1,929 per tonne onaug 29. low crude oil prices are unlikely to dent cpo prices, said malaysian palm oil council (mpoc) chairman datuk lee yeow chor as demand for food outweighs the effects of low crude oil prices. brentoilfell to a 5u00bd-year low under us$57 (rm199.50) per barrel yesterday as persistent worries about a global supply glut offset concerns about output disruptions inlibya. a lot of people put an emphasis on crude oil prices when analysing cpo prices. but the fact is only about 3% of global production of cpo is used for biodiesel, he told the edge financial daily. so the sharply lower price of crude oil will not be a major determining factor for palm oil price, he said. lee, who is ioi corp chief executive officer, foresees cpo prices rallying at rm2,500 per tonne next year due to favourable supply fundamentals for cpo prices. we think after january and february onwards supply fundamentals will be favourable to cpo prices. demand has been very resilient for food, he said. a lot depends on the supply [of cpo]. we expect the palm oil stock to decrease in the coming months and more sharply in january and february, he said, adding that factors affecting palm oil output include the current heavy rainfall in the east coast. lee does not expect the implementation of the goods and services tax (gst) at 6% in april next year to affect the malaysian palm oil industry as close to 90% of the supply is exported, which entails a zero rate. there will be additional administrative costs, maybe, but otherwise, the gst has minimal impact on the industry, he said. on government policies that may affect the industry, uncertainties over the proposed capping of foreign ownership to 30% in indonesian plantation companies may deter oil palm plantation companies from expanding in indonesia, jf apex securities bhd research analyst jessica low jze tieng said. she said the proposed policy is unlikely to be revived if newly-elected indonesian president joko widodo, popularly known as jokowi, intends to encourage foreign direct investment in the country. the proposed policy has led to the outcry from plantation companies and we see that the uncertainties may lead to the expansion in indonesia of plantation companies being put on hold, she told the edge financial daily via email. in our view, we think that the proposed policy is unlikely to be resuscitated if the newly- elected jokowi is to encourage foreign direct investment in the country. a bill calling for foreign ownership to be limited to 30% in plantations had been mooted in the indonesian parliament. upon opposition from foreign plantation business owners, the bill was passed on sept 29 this year without the proposed limitation of foreign ownership. the new policy, however, requires indonesian plantation firms to allocate 20% of their concessions to local residents. it also stipulates that the firms help local smallholders who own plantations and companies be given five years to comply with the new ruling. low said the research firm is expecting cpo prices to hit rm2,400 per tonne by year-end and to climb up further to rm2,500 per tonne in the first quarter of 2015. this is expected to be due to the low production season coupled with an increased demand for palm oil during the chinese new year, she said. low said the research house anticipates a lower-than-expected cpo production in the coming months as the lagged impact of a dry spell in the first quarter of 2014 would hit production. cpo production in the first half of 2015 (1h15) may come under pressure on lagged impact of the drought in 2014, she said. she also said that the shortage of labour remains a challenge in the plantations sector as the booming economy in indonesia and the competitive plantations industry there had resulted in fewer foreign workers being able to work in malaysia. the effect is intensified as there has been no concrete solution in addressing the labour issue, she added. jf apexs top pick in the industry is genting plantations.  this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on december 31, 2014."}, "589":

citys financial regulator. the damage from these outages is going to be larger than any benefit from reducing the board lot sizes, hughes said. given that the outages happened in a short period of time, it certainly had an impact on sgxs reputation. shares move\nsgx sharesare poised for a 7.9 percent gain in 2014, compared with the bloomberg world exchanges indexs 3.8 percent advance. singapores benchmark straits times index has climbed 6.3 percent, while the msci singapore small cap index fell 5.7 percent, declining for a second year. cutting the board lot sizes should help encourage more retail investors to enter the market, said jimmy ho, president of the society of remisiers, which represents stockbrokers who work entirely on commissions. retail investors can now afford to buy the more expensive blue chip shares, which were previously out of reach for some retail investors. these are more attractive and less risky investments than penny stocks. the number of young professionals starting to invest in the stock market has been increasing, lynn gaspar, head of retail investors at sgx, said by phone on dec 19. about 29 percent of the 71,000 individuals who opened new trading accounts with the singapore bourses central depository in the past 12 months were people aged 25 years and under, compared with 19 percent three years ago, she said. the reduction of the minimum board lot really opens up the market in a big way and allows the average singaporean to be included, gaspar said. we see more investors moving into the blue chips, both existing and new ones. new investors \none such investor is michael thong, a 20-year-old student who has just started his two-year national service with the military. he was accompanied on dec 18 by his brother christopher, a 27 year-old airforce pilot, to open his first stock trading account at phillip securities' branch in the eastern suburb of marine parade. i have done well in the stock market, said christopher thong, who said he started buying shares 10 years ago with $3,000 in capital, which has grown to a six-figure sum. im encouraging my brother to get started. he has a lot of time to read up on finance and investing in the army camp. nicholas wong, who started working as a remisier a year ago with phillip securities, singapores largest brokerage by number of clients, said hes getting more interest from new investors ahead of the change. there were a total 1.66 million trading accounts with the central depository as of the end of november, compared with 1.3 million in 2008, according to sgx data. so far, ive got a number of retail investors opening new trading accounts, ahead of the reduction in board lot size, wong said as he helped a new client fill out documents at the brokerages

million credit cards. this is positive for ghl as unionpay and jcb cards are predominantly used for making prepaid payments in the philippines. moreover, omnipay plans to issue six to eight million cards under the unionpay and jcb brands in 2015, versus 2.7 million currently; this should help ghls merchant acquiring process. our suggestion is to accumulate the shares. the stock had a good run

to get bursa malaysia to allow it to have a vote in the proposed merger of cimb group holdings bhd, rhb capital bhd (rhbcap) and malaysia building society bhd (mbsb). yesterday, bursas appeals committee (ac) rejected the epfs appeal to vote in the mega merger. an epf spokesman told the edge financial daily that the pension fund will now explore other avenues, but did not elaborate. the ac, said to be chaired by committee memberdatuk mohammed adnan shuaib, had allowed epf officials to plead their case by making a presentation at a meeting yesterday. however, the committee stood by anoct 21decision by bursas listing committee that the pension fund cannot have a vote on account of it being a common major shareholder of all three entities involved in the merger. we are appreciative of the opportunity to have oral representation at the meeting. even though we dont necessarily agree with the decision, we are respectful of it. we will look at what other avenues are available to us as we need to ensure that the interests of our members are protected, the epf spokesman said. analysts said they were not surprised by the decision as a reversal of stance would have set an unhealthy precedent. under bursas listing rules, the epf cannot vote as it has a 41.5% stake in rhbcap, 64.6% in mbsb and 14.6% in cimb, which gives rise to a potential conflict of interest. rhbcap and mbsb announced in stock exchange filings last night that they had each received a letter from bursa informing them of the rejection the ac decided that the matters raised and the grounds of appeal put forth did not justify a departure from the decision of the listing committee. in particular, there are no adequate justifications that the potential conflict of interests involving the epf has been eliminated or sufficiently mitigated. accordingly, the ac decided to dismiss the appeal and uphold the decision of the listing committee, the letter had read. if the epf was allowed to vote in rhbcap with its 41.5% stake, the merger would pretty much be a done deal if it was for the merger. this is because as the acquirer, rhbcap needs only 50%-plus-one share approval for the deal to go through. the merger has been structured such that rhbcap will acquire larger rival cimbs assets and liabilities via a share swap, after which their respective islamic banks will merge with mbsb to form a mega islamic bank. now that the epf cannot vote, rhbcaps second largest shareholder, abu dhabis aabar investments pjs with its 21.2% stake, has a larger say in the mergers outcome. without the epf, aabar will hold a 36.2% vote, which means that if it does not agree to a deal, it would be tougher  though not impossible  for the merger to go through. for it to go through, it will need the support of rhbcaps other substantial shareholder,osk holdings bhd with its 9.9% stake (but a 16.9% vote with the epf out of the picture) and most of rhbs minority shareholders, which include investment funds like skim amanah saham bumiputera and kumpulan wang persaraan. this merger will now have to go on the merits of the deal, a source close to the merger told the edge financial daily. it is no secret that aabar could be a stumbling block to any merger as it has been seeking a high price of rm12 a share for its stake in rhbcap  much higher than the rm10.03 rhbcap was valued at in this deal. aabar acquired the shares at rm10.80 each in 2011 from its sister company abu dhabi commercial bank, a left-to-right-hand transaction.  this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on december

fund (epf) to vote in the proposed merger of cimb group holdings bhd, rhb capital bhd and malaysia building society bhd only if there are fresh reasons to evaluate, sources say. on oct 21, bursas 10-man listing committee had ruled, after hours of deliberation, that the epf cannot vote in the proposed mega merger on the grounds that there was potential conflict of interest, given that the provident fund is a common major shareholder in all three entities. it is understood that the decision by the committee members that day was unanimous. on oct 31, however, rhb and mbsb had each, at the epfs request, submitted an appeal to bursa to reconsider that decision, a move analysts say indicates that the epf will likely pursue every opportunity it has to be able to vote in the proposed merger. bursa has since come back with a written reply, asking if there are any fresh reasons. it indicated that it will only consider an appeal if there are fresh reasons. but the epf has yet to come up with any, a source tells the edge. bursa has also verbally indicated to the companies that if at all it allows the parties to present an appeal, it would likely happen by nov 28, the source adds. yet another source familiar with bursas operations says that if an appeal is to be heard, it would no longer be deliberated at the listing committee level. it will go one level higher, probably to bursas board of directors, the source says. nevertheless, industry observers and analysts believe that even if bursa were to accommodate an appeal, it is unlikely to budge from its stand of not allowing the epf to vote. i doubt it will suddenly change its mind on the matter, even if the epf provides new reasons. questions will be asked when the stock exchange can reverse important decisions just like that, and it will set an unhealthy precedent, says a banking analyst from a local research firm. others wonder what new line of argument the epf can possibly present to change bursas mind. i think, if its so important for them to vote, they should just express their views to bursa and the public on whether the proposed merger is good or bad for them. its interesting that they have yet to state their opinion on that. theyre just saying that they should be allowed to vote because the interests of their 14 million members are at stake, says another analyst. under bursas listing rules on related-party transactions, the epf cannot vote as it owns substantial stakes in all three entities. it is the single largest shareholder in rhb and mbsb with a 41.5% and 64.6% stake respectively, and holds a 14.6% stake in cimb. prior to the oct 21 rejection, the epf had instructed rhb and mbsb to get bursa to grant it a waiver from the listing rules. sometimes, the way you present your reasons can make all the difference. dont forget that pnb (permodalan nasional bhd) voted in the mega merger of several companies that formed sime darby bhd back in 2007, and the epfs situation in this [banking] merger is not dissimilar to that. so, there is actually a precedent for a supposedly interested party to vote in a big merger, an industry observer says. bursa, in explaining its rejection to rhb and mbsb on oct 21, pointed out that the epfs position is not the same as the other shareholders in the companies. it said its controlling stakes in the two companies put it in a position of significant influence. it also pointed out that the epf had prior knowledge of the proposed merger as it was notified by cimb. it also noted that the epfs overall position in the three entities would differ from that of other shareholders, given the differing terms and valuations applied to the three companies. the merger, which will also bring about a mega islamic bank, has been structured such that rhb will be acquiring larger rival cimbs assets and liabilities via a share swap. after the cimb-rhb merger, their respective islamic banks  cimb islamic and rhb islamic  will merge with mbsb to form the mega islamic bank. if the epf is allowed to vote with its 41.5% stake in rhb, the merger is pretty much in the bag, if it is for the deal. this is because as the acquirer, rhb needs only 50%-plus-one share approval for the deal to go through. if it were the selling party, it would have needed a 75% vote. if the epf has to abstain from voting, then rhbs 21.2% shareholder from abu dhabi  aabar investments pjs  will hold the trump card. without the epf, aabar will hold a 36.2% vote, which means that if it does not agree to the deal, it will be tougher  though not impossible  for the merger to go through. however, the edge reported in its oct 27 issue, quoting a source, that aabar is now leaning towards voting in favour of the deal. it is not clear why this is so, but it is understood that there have been top-level government-to-government discussions. abu dhabi also has other promised investments in malaysia, including a plan to develop a rm21 billion petroleum reserve facility in johor. aabar had earlier been seen as a potential stumbling block to any merger, as it had been seeking a high price of rm12 a share for its stake in rhb  much higher than the rm10.03 rhb was valued at in this deal. aabar acquired the shares at rm10.80 apiece in 2011 from its sister company abu dhabi commercial bank, a left-to-right-hand transaction, which inevitably set a high floor price for any potential merger transactions. rhbs share price, however, has yet to cross the rm10 level in over five years. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on november 10 -

not to restrict oil output and petronas proposed move to cut next years capital expenditure by 15% to 20%. bank of america merril lynchs asean economist chua hak bin said the collapse in oil prices would impact the bottom-lines of petronas and other o&g firms. it is estimated that every dollar change in oil price has a rm1 billion impact on petronas pre-tax profit. it would also hurt investment activities, he said in a note yesterday. in deeming the cut in petronas capex in 2015 as worse than expected, affin investment bank research analyst isaac chow said other o&g companies may follow suit. this will translate into lower earnings and weaker investor appetite for the domestic o&g stocks, he said in his report yesterday. however, the earnings impact may not be reflected immediately, but will likely be skewed towards late 2015, alliancedbs research analyst tan arhnue told the edge financial daily. nevertheless, analysts are of the view that o&g firms with strong order books are likely to prevail over falling crude oil prices. chow prefers companies with integrated business models that have a good geographical spread, on top of a strong order book log. avoid single business stocks that may see earnings downgrade, he advised. public investment bank research in a note yesterday warned that o&g firms could face long-term sustainability issues if they are solely reliant on petronas awards. cimb investment bank research analyst norziana mohd inon said one of her preferred stocks is sapurakencana due to its good leverage in the international and regional markets. she maintained her add rating on the stock with an unchanged target price of rm6.84. comparatively, she maintained her overweight call on the o&g sector. aviation stocks, however, gained on the prospect of cheap jet fuel on falling oil prices. analysts said the lower crude oil prices are a boon for airline companies, with expectation of higher earnings. alliancedbs aviation analyst tan kee hoong

additional rm18 million and rm12 million respectively in fy15 and fy16 for every us$1 cut in jet fuel price, tan added. midf research analyst chua boon kian concurred, saying the current scenario bodes well for airlines as fuel expense makes up 45% to 50% of the two airlines operational expenditure. it will save them substantial operational expenses to report higher earnings, he said. chua

{"date_posted": "24/11/2014", "title": "possible recalibration of mega merger valuation?", "article": " it is difficult to ignore the differences in the stock performance of the three financial groups involved in the mega merger. the sharp decline in the stock price of cimb group holdings bhd compared with rhb capital bhd and malaysia building society bhd (mbsb) since the announcement of the merger begs the question: if the divergence in share prices continues, could it lead to a recalibration of the relative values of the three banks for the merger deal? prior to the announcement of the structure of the mega merger on oct 9, when it was officially revealed that rhb cap would be buying the assets and liabilities of cimb, the share price of cimb had been on a downward trend, while rhb cap and mbsb saw their stocks rise. cimbs share price closed at rm6.98 on oct 8 and it has since nosedived 11.6% over a 2u00bd-week period to a one-year closing low of rm6.17 on oct 27. it recovered to close at rm6.50 on oct 30. meanwhile, rhb caps share price, which closed at rm8.70 on oct 8, rose to rm8.77 on oct 30. mbsb closed at rm2.37 on oct 8, and ended at rm2.61 on oct 30. interestingly, the sharp movement in its stock price during this period had caused cimbs market capitalisation relative to the merged entity to drop to 70.8% as at oct 30, compared with 72.4% on oct 8. meanwhile, rhb caps market capitalisation vis-u00e0-vis the merged entity increased to 29.2% from 27.6% in the same period. while there is a shift in the ratios, the total market capitalisation of the merged entity is about the same for the period. given that the proposals are now being put together for the consideration of shareholders at the coming egm, is the change in valuation significant enough to fbe factored into the merger deal? if it is, it could be positive for shareholders of rhb, which include aabar investments pjs. however, banking analysts say a change in valuations is unlikely. yes, the stock prices of the banks have deviated from the valuation offered but i dont think they will change the offer if the ratios are not that far apart. there are investors watching the stocks and would arbitrage either way, and that could help maintain the ratio, says an analyst. he adds that cimb had a closed-door meeting with analysts on tuesday. cimbs stock price clawed back some ground to rm6.50 on thursday, from its one-year closing low of rm6.17 on monday. on friday, cimb closed at rm6.49. cimb management shared with analysts how they were going to realise the cost synergies. an integration cost of rm1.4 billion is huge. that is obviously a concern they are addressing. they also shared with analysts about the accounting of goodwill for the deal, where it would be rhbs goodwill that will be accounted for, the analyst says. while the topic of recalibrating the relative values of the three banks emerges due to their recent stock performances, it should be noted that rhb cap had already been given a premium in the proposed share swap. according to sources familiar with the matter, the ratios were calculated based on a number of factors that include the composite of market prices and price to book value. therefore, despite the price decline of cimb relative to rhb, it does not necessarily imply that the relative share exchange ratios should be changed, says a source. the proposed acquisition of cimbs assets and liabilities by rhb cap is at a share swap ratio of one rhb cap share to 1.38 cimb shares. rhb cap shares are valued at rm10.03, while cimb shares are valued at rm7.27. the proposed offer values rhb cap at 1.4 times price to book of june 14 and 1.7 times for cimb. what is interesting, industry observers and analysts say, is that cimbs share price has fallen relative to rhb cap, which is contrary to the norm in takeover deals, where it is the acquirer  in this case, rhb cap  that should see a fall in its stock price. so why did cimbs stock fall? there are mixed views on this. some analysts say it is likely specific to cimb and not a result of the merger proposal. cimb niagas results were disappointing and cimb groups recent june quarter results were not that great as well, says a banking analyst. cimbs 97.94%-owned indonesian unit pt bank cimb niaga tbks net profit for the first nine months ended sept 30, 2014 fell 28.5% to idr2.3 trillion (rm628.2 million) from idr3.21 trillion a year ago mainly due to higher interest expense and provisions. uob kay hian research on oct 29 noted that the roe of cimb group remains under pressure and the potential merger adds to the overhang. given the persistent challenges of npl (non-performing loans) and the overall growth outlook in indonesia, it would be increasingly challenging for the group to meet its 13.5-14.0% roe target. with this rather bleak outlook in indonesia, moderating consumer loans growth in malaysia and lacklustre capital market activities impacting overall income growth, the groups roe is likely to settle closer to the 12.5% level in 2014, it states. another analyst points out that while rhb cap is acquiring the assets and liabilities of cimb, the market views cimb as the deemed acquirer in this merger. meanwhile, epf ceo datuk shahril ridza ridzuan told the edge financial daily last week that the epf will not pare down its stake in cimb although bursa malaysia has disallowed it from voting on the merger of the three banks in which it holds substantial stakes. there is a lot of speculation in the market ... we will not change our investment strategy, he said on the sidelines of the 10th world islamic economic forum in dubai when asked about talk of the epf trimming its stake in cimb to garner voting rights. he also reiterated that there was no real conflict of interest for the epf to vote on the merger involving cimb, rhb cap and mbsb. in separate announcements to bursa malaysia last friday, rhb cap and mbsb said that upon the request of the epf to both banks, they have submitted separate appeal applications on oct 31 with regard to bursas decision on epfs voting rights in the merger. this article first appeared in the

down 59% y-o-y, mainly due to higher raw material and electricity costs. the flexible packaging converter has been facing problems managing its operating costs since mid-2012. as such, we were relieved to see tomypaks earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) margin for the third quarter (3q) of fy14 bounce back to 12.4% compared with only 8.4% in 2q. we need

tomypaks balance sheet showed rm18 million net debt, or only 0.2 times net gearing as at end-september. we believe this land purchase is long overdue as the operations at its existing factory in johor

ask for a seat on the board. we are upgrading tomypak from reduce to hold. we have been negative on the stock since may due to the weak quarterly earnings results. since then, its share price has been

three-a resources bhd, bimb holdings bhd and tomypak holdings bhd. dialog group bhd (dialog) has entered into a shareholders agreement with petronas gas bhd (pgas) in relation to a rm2.7 billion development of liquefied natural gas (lng) regasification facilities at pengerang, johor. the project, according to dialog, is to develop a regasification unit and two units of 200,000 m3 lng storage tanks with an initial send out capacity of 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of natural gas. in a filing with bursa malaysia today, dialog said it was entered into the sha with pgas through its wholly-owned subsidiaries dialog lng sdn bhd (dialog lng) and pengerang lng (two) sdn bhd (plng-2). dialog said plng-2 will act as the special purpose vehicle to undertake the aforesaid project. \"plng-2 will be restructured whereby pgas will acquire 65% in plng-2 with dialog lng to hold 25% and the state secretary, johor (incorporated) to hold the remaining 10%,\" the filing read. on the funding, dialog said it would be satisfied by equity injection, shareholders loan and external borrowings. \"the pengerang lng project is expected to provide additional sources of long\nterm sustainable and recurring income in the future for dialog,\" it said, adding that it will also synergise with the group's investment in petroleum and petrochemical storage terminals in pengerang, kertih and tanjung langsat. in a separate filing, pgas said the project is expected to commence construction by second quarter next year and to achieve commercial operations date by fourth quarter of 2017. dialog closed at rm1.56 today giving it a market capitalisation of rm7.69 billion while petgas inched up 20 sen to close at rm21.66, translating into a market capitalisation of rm42.86 billion. airasia bhd expects strong growth next year in anticipation of lower fuel costs and airfares will generate higher demand for the low-cost airline's services. group ceo tan sri tony fernandes said airfares had risen about 11%, which was deemed substantial. but the current backdrop of cheaper jet fuel has lifted airasia's optimism to lower fares whilst stimulating more demand, moving forward, according to fernandes. \"2015 will be one of our best years, coupled with all our ancillary initiatives that we have launched, like our wifi, where we see almost 40% of our passengers using the service when they fly, including our duty-free products that we have launched. \"if oil prices continues to go down, maybe we can get rid of oil surcharges, and that will stimulate more people to

was secured at the company's bondholder meeting today. the sukuk holders also released silk holdings from its obligation under the corporate guarantee for the sukuk, the company said. holders of silk's rm2 billion sukuk include cimb bank bhd, bank islam malaysia bhd and etiqa takaful bhd. silk is a wholly-owned subsidiary of silk holdings bhd and the concession holder for the 37km kajang silk highway. the highway links the northern and southern parts of kajang, selangor. silk holdings is selling toll expressway to unlock the value of its investment in silk. the sale will enable silk

market capitalisation of rm585.78 million. three-a resources bhd recorded a net profit of rm4.68million in the third quarter ended sept 30, up 163% from rm1.78million a year ago due to lower material and finance costs. earnings per share (eps) grew to 1.19 sen from 0.45 sen a year ago. in an announcement to bursa malaysia today, the soy food manufacturer attributed improved profit to lower materials and finance costs plus higher operational efficiency. furthermore, there was an impairment of trade receivables in the previous corresponding quarter. however, the revenue for 3q14 dropped slightly by 2.4% to rm72.96million from rm74.77million last year, as a result of lower sales of the group's products ranging from soy sauce to glucose syrup. the stock closed 0.5 sen lower at 92 sen, giving it a market capitalisation of rm362.11 million. malaysia's largest islamic fund manager, lembaga tabung haji (tabung haji), has been accumulating shares in bimb holdings bhd (bimb) in the past week, and now holds a 54.5% equity stake in the bank. a filing with bursa malaysia showed tabung haji had bought a total of 6.12 million shares over five transactions between nov 7 and 13 when bimb's share price was on the decline. the latest shopping spree brings tabung haji's stake in bimb to 54.5% or 814.03 million shares. bimb's share continued a week-long downward trend to close at rm1.15, down three sen. this gives bimb a market capitalisation of rm6.19 billion. tomypak holdings bhd (tomypak) saw its net profit suffered in the third quarter ended sep 30, 2014 (3q14). the flexible packaging manufacturer's earnings was almost halved to rm2.23 million year-on-year, from rm4.02 million the same period last year. revenue for the quarter declined 11.6% year-on-year to rm51.57 million from rm58.3 million in 3q13. earnings per share (eps) clocks in at 2.04 sen compared to 3.68 sen the same time last year. despite the sharp drop on earnings, tomypak declares dividend per

increase. \"with the anticipated growth in sales revenue, the group had purchased an industrial land for future expansion purpose,\" it added. tomypak's share price has also been drifiting lower,

committee to discuss epf vote on oct 21", "article": " bursa malaysias listing committee is set to meet tuesday to discuss whether it will allow the employees provident fund (epf) to vote on the proposed mega merger of cimb group holdings bhd, rhb capital bhd and malaysia building society bhd (mbsb), says a source familiar with the matter. it (the epf vote) is on the agenda. a decision should be made that day, the source tells the edge. the epf is keen on voting to protect its investments. however, under bursas listing rules, it cannot vote as it would be deemed a conflict of interest as it is the common major shareholder in all three entities. it is the single largest shareholder in rhbcap and mbsb with stakes of 41.5% and 64.6% stakes respectively, and owns a 14.6% stake in cimb. bursa, however, can make an exemption. the listing committee, comprising 10 individuals led by chairman datuk md tap salleh, will be the one to make the call. md tap is president of the malaysian institute of integrity. it is understood that the epf only wants the right to vote at the shareholders meetings of rhbcap and mbsb. both rhb and mbsb had, at the epfs behest, written to bursa to put forwardthe pension funds request for a waiver of the listing rules. bursa, however, required more information from the two companies. according to a bursa source, before the bourse could make a decision on the waiver, it wanted, among other things, the boards of the two companies to make a stand on whether they thought the epf should be allowed to vote on the proposed merger, the edge financial daily reported on oct 10, following a bursa listing committee meeting the previous day. it is understood that by the end of last tuesday, the boards of rhbcap and mbsb had forwarded separate letters to bursa, clarifying some matters that the stock exchange required. the letters were cautiously worded u2026 im not sure that they amount to making a stand, a source familiar with the merger discussions tells the edge. it is against this backdrop that bursas listing committee meets on tuesday. the merger, which will also spawn a mega islamic bank, has been structured such that rhbcap will be acquiring larger rival cimbs assets and liabilities via a share swap. after the cimb-rhbcap merger, their respective islamic banks  cimb islamic and rhb islamic  will merge with mbsb to form the mega islamic bank. if the epf is allowed to vote with its 41.5% stake in rhbcap, the merger is pretty much in the bag if it is for the deal. this is because as the acquirer, rhbcap needs only 50%-plus-one share approval for the deal to go through. if it were the selling party, it would have needed a 75% vote. however, if bursa rules that the epf must abstain from voting, then rhbcaps 21.2% shareholder from the middle east  aabar investments pjs u2013 will hold the trump card. without the epf, aabar will hold a 36.2% vote, which means that if it does not agree to the deal, it will be tougher  though not impossible  for the merger to go through. for it to go through, the merger will need the support of rhbcaps other substantial shareholder, osk holdings bhd, with its 9.9% stake (but a 16.9% vote if epf were out of the picture) and most of rhbcaps minority shareholders, which include investment funds such as skim amanah saham bumiputera and kumpulan wang persaraan. while theres no telling which way aabar will vote, it is no secret that aabar could be a stumbling block to any merger as it has been seeking a high price of rm12 a share for its stake in rhbcap  much higher than the rm10.03 rhbcap was valued at in this deal. aabar acquired the shares at rm10.80 each in 2011 from its sister company abu dhabi commercial bank, a left-to-right-hand transaction, which inevitably set a high floor price for any potential merger transactions. rhbcaps share price, however, has yet to cross the rm10 level in over five years. bursas decision still matters. if the epf is able to vote, it improves the chances of the deal going through. if not, then rhbcap has to bring the deal to shareholders to see if it can get enough votes to see it through, a source told the edge two weeks ago. at the mbsb level, industry observers say whether or not the epf is allowed to vote with its 64.6% stake, the deal is likely to go through as the offer for mbsbs assets and liabilities  at rm2.82 a share  is attractive. mbsb was accorded the highest valuation of the three financial institutions at 1.93 times price-to-book, and the price was a 20.5% premium to its rm2.34 share price on july 9, the day before the parties proposed to discuss a three-way merger. shareholders have the choice of receiving cash or shares in the enlarged islamic bank.  epf ceo datuk shahril ridza ridzuan, in an interview with the edge in mid-september on the funds investments, pointed out that bursas decision on the vote would have implications on the pension funds investments in other listed companies. he highlighted that since the epf owns more than 5% in more than 100 companies, there is a chance it could get caught in a similar situation in the future. that is precisely why we want a ruling decision from bursa because what they rule today will have implications on our investments in the rest of the companies. when asked what would happen if bursa ruled that the epf cannot vote, shahril said: if that happens, then technically we have to be very careful with our investments in the future, like how much we hold in a company. we now have stakes in many companies, like all the big banks, plantation companies, and so on. if we cannot have voting rights in these institutions and they try to do deals with each other, it is very dangerous for us. (if there is) any merger in the banking sector, we would be cut out if we cannot vote because we own stakes in all the banks  maybank, ambank, and so on  so what do we do? he went on to say that the epf needs to decide on a strategy to avoid this kind of situation in the future. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on october 20 - 26, 2014."}, "602": {"date_posted":

foreign selling activities. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since may 2013 were trapped in rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15

signals have turned negative recently. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at the 1,766, 1,800 and 1,810-levels, whilst the resistance areas of 1,815, 1,858 and 1,896 would offer very heavy liquidation and profit-taking activities. the klcis 18 and 40 simple moving averages (sma) depict a downtrend for its daily chart. in addition, the 50 and 200 sma have also issued a dead cross and the index prices are still below these two longer-term smas and below the shorter-term 18 and 40 smas. therefore, the recent rebound from the 1,766.22 low has obviously stalled at 1,858.09. this has opened up downside possibilities for the index once again. due to the bearish tone for the klci index, we are recommending a chart sell on malaysian resources corporation berhad (mrcb). mrcb released its second quarter financial year 2014 (2qfy14) results at the end of august and is expected to announce its 3qfy14 results some time this month. looking at the results announcement, group revenue increased to rm530.3 million in first half financial year 2014 (1hfy14) from rm447.8 million in 1hfy13, while net profit for the cumulative 1hfy14 rose to rm162.7 million from myr18.2 million. the improved profitability was attributed to higher revenue contributions from the property development division mainly from ongoing development projects of q sentral offices and the sentral residences, as well as an exceptional item from the disposal of investment in duke highway. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that nine research houses cover mrcb. of these, eight are buy calls and a single hold call on the stock. this stock currently trades at an expensive 2014 estimated price-earnings ratio of 38.4 times, while its price-to-book value ratio, which is on the high side, trades at 1.29 times. mrcbs gearing remains extremely high at 4.1 times. the return on equity remains low at just 0.6% while its debt-to-assets ratio is marginally above the 50% mark. the reported shareholding changes on bloomberg revealed there was minor net buying from local investors over the past month. mrcbs chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly timeframes is very firmly down. its share price made a decline since its major weekly wave-2 high of rm2.27 in feb 2012. since that rm2.27 high, mrcb fell to its recent october 2014 low of rm1.42. as prices broke below its recent key critical support levels of rm1.70 and rm1.66, look to sell mrcb on any rebounds to its resistance areas, as the moving averages depict very firm short- to medium-term downtrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi and stochastic) have issued sell signals and now depict very firm indications of mrcbs eventual move towards much lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm1.46, rm1.66 and rm1.70. we expect mrcb to witness weak buying interest at its support levels of rm1.21, rm1.23 and rm1.42. its

bfood once they turn profitable. first in the pipeline could be papa johns pizza in two years time, writes cimb, which also reckons that bfood will see another earnings boost from distributing

following the completion of its rm71.8 million acquisition of the remaining 50% of starbucks malaysia on sept 18 this year. assuming bfood owns 100% of starbucks malaysia in fy2014, the latter should

"time to accumulate construction stocks?", "article": " disappointing earnings in the quarter ended june 30 resulted in rather heavy profit-taking in construction stocks, which had risen substantially in the first half of the year. analysts see the share price weakness as a buying opportunity for those who had missed the boat earlier amid expectations that the construction sector would be a beneficiary of the upcoming budget 2015, to be tabled in parliament this friday. besides, they point out, most of the construction companies have healthy order books that would sustain them over the next two years. the selling of construction stocks has dragged bursa malaysias construction index down over the past month. it had slid to a four-month low of 299.89 points last thursday from a peak of 313.12 points in august. it is not surprising that investors are selling as most of the stocks under our coverage have good order books, although they posted lower net profits, says an analyst, adding that this is not a concern. the financial progress of construction is lagging behind. the lower revenue and earnings were mainly due to less project recognition during the quarter. gamuda bhd, for example, saw the net profit of its constructionsegment drop 36.1% year on year to rm32.9million in its fourth quarter ended july 31 (4qfy2014) while revenue plunged 65.7% to rm361 million due to the large recognition boost last year from the electrified doubletrack project. other construction players attributed their lower net profit to less billings, foreign exchange losses, smaller operating profit because of higher operating costs and an increase in material costs, among others. now that the shares of the construction companies have come down, it may be a good time to get back into the industry, which is expected to benefit from upcoming projects, says the analyst, adding that the sector remains robust with several more contracts to be awarded next year. we still have an outperform rating on the sector as there are projects in the pipeline. the construction stocks that saw a sell-off include wct holdings bhd, ijm corp bhd and hock seng lee bhd. investor disappointment stemmed from high expectations of improved earnings, given the strong order books of the companies. wct, for example, has an order book of about rm3.1 billion, ijm some rm5 billion and hock seng lee rm1.1 billion. yet, wcts net profit dropped to rm34.3 million in 2qfy2014 ended june 30 from rm56.7 million in the previous corresponding quarter. revenue fell to rm401 million from rm482.5 million. the stock declined 7% or 16 sen to rm2.16 last thursday from rm2.32 onaug 6. ijm lost 3.5% or 23 sen from rm6.65 onaug 19 to close at rm6.42 last thursday. its net profit shrank to rm133.4 million in 1qfy2015 ended june 30 from rm164.3 million previously. revenue was stagnant at rm1.4 billion. hock seng lee closed at rm1.85 last thursday, down 7% fromrm1.99 onaug 21. it posted a lower net profit of rm18.9 million in 2qfy2014 ended june 30 compared with rm22.6 million previously. revenue was rm140 million. despite the sectors recent poorer earnings, rhb researchs joshua ng is positive on its outlook and maintains his overweight recommendation. while the quarterly numbers of ijm corp, kimlun corp bhd, protasco bhd and hock seng lee fell short on an annualised basis, we expect them to report stronger quarters ahead. he adds that the sector will not lose its momentum and expects the current strong activities to continue and drive medium-term earnings growth. the construction industrys bright prospects have, in fact, attracted newplayers with an eye on future mega projects, such as the klang valley mrt 2, west coast expressway, kuantan port expansion, rapid projects, monorail extension from kl sentral to bandar sunway and the gemas-johor double track railway. two weeks ago, sunway bhd announced its plan to list its construction arm, sunway construction group bhd, in the second quarter of 2015. the proposal does not come as a surprise because the construction sector is now in the spotlight, thanks to increasing infrastructure work in the klang valley. at the same time, the property sector is taking a breather, post cooling measures effected by the government. moving forward, cimb researchs sharizan rosely advises investors to accumulate potential beneficiaries of budget 2015. hepoints out that this time, the total allocation for construction and infrastructure is likely to be higher than budget 2014s rm8.8 billion. the allocation for basic infrastructure projects should be more relevant to medium-sized contractors such as malaysian resources corp bhd, puncak niaga holdings bhd, ahmad zaki resources bhd, salcon bhd and the pipe players. the likely greater emphasis on mrt 2 should be positive for gamuda. he adds that although the new budgets theme would be more relevant to the smaller players, our expectation of a 54% average growth in the order books of contractors we cover remains intact as it is also driven by private sector contracts. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on october 06 - 12, 2014."}, "610":

appreciated 29.3% over six months to reach rm73.36 on sept 12. while the stock has given up some of those gains  especially following the sept 22 reversal of its sept 8 price hike  its rm70.46 close on oct 1 (wednesday) was above all target prices of the 17 analysts polled by bloomberg, ranging from jp morgans rm54.30 to credit suisses rm70 apiece. it is worth noting that bat, which commands 62% of the domestic cigarette market, earlier said it needed to raise prices to offset higher costs. jt international bhd, which has a market share of 22%, followed suit on sept 12, but philip morris international (pmi)  with 16% market share  did not raise its prices. amresearch analyst cheryl tan says pmis decision may have been guided by a desire to capture a larger share of the shrinking legal

pending bats financial results in october. in any case, bat-cd  issued on sept 11, a few days after bats rm1 price hike  was trading at a 5% premium to the underlying share at its 6.5 sen close on oct

prices, especially when pmi did not follow suit. eing, who has a rm58.10 target price in a sept 22 note, tells clients to reduce exposure to bat, adding its dividend yields are also not attractive enough. that said, bat increased its first-half financial year 2014 dividends to 78 sen, from 68 sen in 1hfy2013. it is noteworthy that the government will be tabling budget 2015 on oct 10, when it

and have had their fair share of controversies. the most recent merger  between hong leong bank and eon bank  was completed in 2011 and had many twists and turns. it eventually ended up in court before finally being inked after 17 months. the merger had dragged on for so long because one significant shareholder of eon bank objected to it and went to court to fight its case but lost. the current cimb-rhb-mbsb merger proposal is also in a sticky situation because a significant shareholder of rhb capital  abu dhabi-based aabar investments pjs  has indicated that it will not accept any deal if its asking price is not met. almost three months since the announcement, the dynamics are getting more complex and intriguing. while negotiators from all three parties are beavering away to come up with a concrete structure (the biggest hurdle is always pricing), the outcome will very much depend on bursa malaysias decision on whether the employees provident fund (epf) can vote. industry observers even say that if the epf is not allowed to vote, there is really little point in coming up with a deal because the outcome is a foregone conclusion: rhbcaps 21.2% shareholder aabar investments will not vote yes unless it is paid rm11.80 a share and, apparently, it must be a cash deal. and the indications so far are that neither of the other parties involved  the epf and cimb  is willing to value rhbcap at rm11.80 apiece. bursa malaysia meets on oct 9 to decide whether or not the epf can vote. under the exchanges listing rules, the epf cannot vote because it is deemed a related party as it holds stakes in all three financial institutions. bursa, however, has the power to grant an exemption. coincidentally or by design, the bursa meeting is taking place one day after the end of the 90-day exclusivity period for the three parties to come up with a deal. the talk now is that bank negara malaysia will grant an extension. the bursa decision, whatever it is, will be a landmark one. pressure is already mounting, the latest being a letter sent by abu dhabis deputy prime minister sheikh mansor zayed al nahyan to putrajaya protesting against letting the epf vote. bursa is indeed caught between a rock and a hard place. if it allows the epf a waiver so that it can vote, there are concerns that it could set a precedent for the future with others in a similar situation also asking for, and expecting to be given, an exemption. yet, the epf is unlike the typical substantial shareholders of companies. it is unique because it is a pension fund for all malaysian workers and it does hold more than 5% equity interest in over 100 companies listed on the local stock exchange because the malaysian capital market lacks the depth and breadth for the pension fund to have a more diversified portfolio. while negotiators from all three parties are working on a concrete structure, the outcome will very much depend on whether bursa allows the epf to vote on the merger. - photo by kenny yap inevitably, at any point in time, the epf will be involved in related-party transactions. is it fair, therefore, to deny it the right to vote to protect its own interest? as a major shareholder, and given its unique position, shouldnt the pension fund have a say in a corporate exercise of this magnitude? so, what can be done to overcome this sticky situation? perhaps, one way out is for the epf to be allowed to vote, but with a condition that it set up three separate investment committees, each of which will independently decide whether the merger is in the interest of cimb, rhb and mbsb respectively. this will remove any conflict that could arise if the existing investment committee of the epf is to decide on how it will vote at all three entities. the main epf investment panel must abide by whatever decision is made by each of the three independent committees, even if it means voting against the merger. there must be transparency and governance. that is at the epf level. as for pressure from abu dhabi, it cannot be stressed enough that bursas decision on oct 9 should not in any way be influenced by it. the decision must be based on what is right for the epf, its members as well as the minority shareholders of all three financial institutions. it should not succumb to the demands of abu dhabi or even putrajaya. indeed, putrajaya should not give in to the threat from abu dhabi that it will pull out investments from malaysia. past experiences have shown how volatile and unreliable foreign direct investment flows from the middle east are, such as in iskandar malaysia where all the promised billions in investments never materialised. one can even question how much of abu dhabis investments in malaysia has really translated into money spent on projects. some of the promised projects involving investments from abu dhabi include the tun razak exchange and bandar malaysia, a joint venture with 1malaysia development bhd, and the development of a rm21 billion strategic petroleum reserve facility in johor. until now, these are all still words. not a single sen has been spent. abu dhabi has said it wants rm11.80 to rm12 or its no deal, one of its arguments being that it had acquired its stake in rhbcap in 2011 at rm10.80 a share. it must be noted, however, that the figure was a related-party valuation as aabar had bought its stake from abu dhabi commercial bank, and that it was higher than rhbs market price at the time. abu dhabi commercial bank had acquired the shares at rm7.20 each in 2008. the rm11.80 to rm12 a share price is said to have been arrived at after taking into account aabars holding cost, including interest payments and foreign exchange losses. rhbcaps share price, however, has not breached the rm10 level since 2008. the highest it has risen is rm9.98 on june 3, 2011. any investor knows that all investments involve risk and that returns are not guaranteed. of course, aabar investments can include its holding cost in the equation when coming up with the price at which it is willing to sell, but at the end of the day, the right price should be determined by the market. and in any case, the epf cannot take out aabar alone at rm12 because the same price must be offered to all other shareholders of rhbcap. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on october 06 - 12, 2014."}, "612":

equity sell-off and a cut to germanys growth forecasts stirred memories of the eurozones sovereign-debt crisis in 2011. a bigger-than-expected drop in us retail sales also ignited concern about the impact of the global slowdown on the american economy. the s&p 500 index plunged 15.21 points to close at 1,862.49 points whilst the dow tumbled 173.45 points to end at 16,141.74. the fbm klci index traded in a wider range of 41.18 points for the week with lower volumes of 1.81 billion to 2.58 billion shares traded. the index closed at 1,767.77 points on oct 16, down 19.07 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks such as axiata group bhd, cimb group holdings bhd, genting bhd, sapurakencana petroleum bhd and umw holdings bhd caused the index to fall on persistent selling activities. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements, since may 2013, have been trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69 (high), 1,802.88 (low), 1,896.23 (high), 1,837.28 (low) and 1,879.62 (high). all the indexs daily signals turned negative recently. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at 1,700, 1,727 and 1,759, while the resistance areas of 1,767 and 1,800 and 1,829 would offer heavy liquidation and selling activities. the klcis simple-moving averages (18, 40 and 20) depict an emerging downtrend for its daily and weekly charts. with the prices breaking below the larger and lower rising wedge support line on sept 15, 2014, we foresee longer-term selling activities for the index. the selling pressure would be intense and persistent if and when the index rebounds. downside targets for this move are at 1,730 (in the short term) and 1,682 (in the medium term). due to the softer tone for the klci index, we are recommending a chart sell on british american tobacco (m) bhd (bat). bat turned into downtrend since hitting its recent 52-week high of rm73.48 in august 2014. at maybank investment bank bhd, our fundamental analyst has an unchanged sell call on bat and target price of rm62. in a surprise move in early september 2014, bat announced an 8% to 9% price hike per cigarette box. this was its third price increase in just over a year, but bat reversed its decision after two weeks. despite the surprising u-turn to pre-sept 8 price hikes, our analysts forecast remains unchanged as he had expected higher operating costs and assumed a larger 12% year-on-year volume contraction will mitigate the higher revenue from the price hike. with the reversion of the price hike, our analyst currently assumes a 6% per annum contraction. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that 17 research houses have coverage on bat. of the 17, there are only two buy calls, seven hold calls and eight sell calls. this stock currently trades at expensive price-to-earnings ratio of 21.6 times while its price-to-book value ratio of 34.9 times indicates that its share price is trading at a premium to its book value. the reported shareholding changes on bloomberg revealed net selling by mostly foreign institution funds over the past month. bats chart trend on the daily time frame is very weak and is firmly down. its share price made a large plunge since its daily wave-5 and recent all-time high of rm73.48 in august 2014. since that rm73.48 high, bat plunged to its recent october 2014 low of rm65.14. as prices broke above their recent key critical support levels of rm71.50 and rm71.20, look to sell bat on any rebound to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to medium-term downtrends for this stock. the daily indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) have issued sell signals and now depict very firm indications of bats eventual move towards much lower levels. it would attract very weak buying interest at the support levels of rm63.05, rm65.14 and rm65.50. we expect bat to attract major liquidation towards its resistance levels of rm66.72, rm71.20 and rm71.50. its downside targets are located at rm62.75, rm61.90 and rm56.90.  \nlee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at

million took full-year earnings to rm335 million. this is only 94% and 90% of our and consensus estimates. the major variation was the higher prize payout, although we understand the group made

investment bank (june 17): we expect indonesia to remain the main driver for ijmps overall fresh fruit bunch (ffb) output growth, underpinned by more planted areas reaching maturity (5,000ha to 8,000ha a year over the next three years). we projected overall ffb production to grow 10% to 13% in fy03/15-17 (versus 9.3% to 10% previously), underpinned by a 26% to 43% increase in ffb production in indonesia over the next three years. we are raising our fy03/15-16 net profit forecasts by 5.3% and 12% respectively, largely to account for higher ffb yield and lower production cost assumptions for its indonesian operations. based on our sensitivity analysis, every rm100 per tonne increase in our average cpo price assumption will raise our fy03/15-17 net profit forecasts by 8.3% to 8.6%. we raise our target price on the stock by 12.1% to rm3.81, based on unchanged 17 times revised fy03/16 eps of 22.4 sen. although we like its strong balance sheet and young age profile, we believe ijmps

the p3 alliance on june 17 as it thinks the proposed vessel-pooling accord will restrict competition on the busiest asia-europe routes. the p3 members (maersk, msc and cma cgm) have announced that the p3 plan will now be scrapped. despite its solid earnings delivery and strong non-p3 volume growth, westports share price performance has been lacklustre since its listing in october 2013 because of concerns about p3. given the latest development, we believe westports will see an overdue re-rating. it trades at an implied forward per of 18 times, below its regional peers average of 22 times. we are reversing the potential impact and raising our full-year container volume growth to 10% and 9% for fy14 and fy15 respectively. consequently, our fy14-fy16 eps forecasts are raised by 2%, 4% and 4%

gloves 9mfy14 net profit came in below expectations, at 69.2% and 66% of our and consensus full-year forecasts respectively. meanwhile, 9mfy14 revenue dropped 3.9% y-o-y owing to lower selling prices while core net profit declined 4.6% because of the poorer performance from china and the higher effective tax rate. thus, we are reducing our fy14-fy16 net profit forecasts by 5% to 8%, trimming our target price, still based on 14.5 times per (about 20% discount to hartalega). we maintain a hold on top glove but prefer kossan. top glove declared its first dividend for fy14, a single-tier dividend per share of 7 sen, in line with our forecast. we think that top glove has been able to contain its operating costs quite well through aggressive cost-optimisation initiatives. this can be seen from the stronger ebitda margin, although it was impacted by the large foreign exchange loss in 9mfy14. the higher ebitda margin was also driven by higher sales contribution from nitrile. sapurakencana

group announced an acquisition of the remaining 20% in f&b nutrition sdn bhd (f&b) for rm112.9 million via the issuance of 39.753 million shares at rm2.84 apiece. the price tag implies a valuation of

the groups huge borrowings of rm388.2 million (as at march 31, 2014) against that amount leaves us with a residual of rm658.5 million, valuing can-one at rm3.43 per share on the enlarged share base.

(thailand) co ltd (somt), for a total cash consideration of us$162.9 million (rm522.9 million). the disposals are expected to be completed this month. the disposals do not come as a surprise, as sime darby sold off its malaysian power plant in april for rm300 million in a bid to dispose of its non-core assets. we maintain our sum-of-parts (sop)-based fair value of rm10.40 and our neutral recommendation. although we are still positive on the plantation sector as a whole, the weaknesses at sime darbys heavy equipment and motor division could be a threat to earnings growth, despite its sensitivity to crude palm oil (cpo) prices. hence, we advocate shifting away from the more integrated players to the purer planters, which would benefit more significantly from cpo price movements. sarawak cable bhd\nfair value: rm1.70 hold \namresearch (june 17): we place our fair value rating for scable under review, pending further details on the proposed acquisitions that were announced

the offer will fortify scable as the leading cable manufacturer in the country with an estimated market share of more than 50%. we understand that following the acquisition, scable will essentially supply all the cables for the 500kv job on a consolidated basis. the acquiree companies are two of the top suppliers in peninsular malaysia. margins are likely to be similar with that of scables existing power cable business. note that non-independent and non-executive director datuk seri hng bok san is the controlling shareholder of hng. if accepted, we expect the share sale agreement to be

will seek shareholders approval for a series of restructuring exercises, which will see a backdoor listing of hlis infrastructure business into narra. we see a trading buy opportunity as there could be significant upside to our sum-of-parts (sop) valuation should narras current implied valuation hold up. the implied post-exercise value of narra at rm4.49 per hli share is well above our rm2.30 for hli. narras implied post-exercise market cap is rm2 billion, implying a share price of rm4.16. while we doubt narras present lofty valuation can sustain after the exercise, we acknowledge that it could fetch a valuation that is significantly above our appraised valuation. should narras valuation hold up after the restructuring, our adjusted sop valuation and target price for hli would be rm10.39 and rm9.26 respectively. this compares with our target price of rm6.86, which assumes narra shares at rm2.30 per hli share and a 20% holding company discount to our sop valuation of rm5.70 for

management. management is striving to achieve key performance indicators for fy15 by replicating fy14s loan growth of 14.1% y-o-y in fy15e, and achieving a higher return on equity of above 14% in

attractive dividends, with a net yield of 4.8% to 5.8% in fy15-fy17, subsequent to a slight increase in the payout ratio from 50% to 60% (which was announced during the last results quarter). management is more proactive and will continue to focus on achieving near-term strategic priorities, such as a 30% non-interest income ratio. malaysia airports holdings bhd\ntarget price: rm10.55

of chinese incidents. we believe mas as the main airline operator in klias main terminal building (-3.2% y-o-y in may) severely affected mahb. since mid-may, local airlines  mas, airasia group

(june 10): talkmed group ltd is an established medical oncology and palliative care services provider. our discounted cash flow (dcf) derived target price of s$1.20 translates into a cy15 per of 21.4 times, compared to singapores healthcare sector average cy15 per of 27 times. in singapore, cancer has been the leading cause of death since 2006, and the governments efforts to raise awareness will prompt more people to seek early treatment.  medical oncology is a highly specialised branch of medicine. the collective medical expertise of the professionals at talkmed is not easily duplicated. such entry barriers have resulted in strong operating profit margins (fy10-13 average of 76%) and return on equity (87.5%, annualising 1qfy14). the business requires no capex due to the collaboration with parkway cancer centre. as such, the strong free cash flow allows talkmed to target a 75% payout ratio.  talkmeds challenge is the scalability of its oncology medical services, given that 69.2% of 1hfy13s revenue was derived from its key founder, dr ang peng tiam. whether or not the singapore talkmed franchise can be successfully replicated in the rest of asia remains to be seen. offsetting the attractive 75% dividend payout target are poor liquidity and likely low organic growth.av concept holdings ltdtarget price: hk$0.84 buyebs international (june 10): owing to the strong demand for mobile internet and the rolling out of 3g and 4g services worldwide, demand for smartphones was robust in the past few years. taking into account that the mobile internet penetration rate was less than 30% in 2013, we expect the near-term demand for smartphones to remain strong. av concept is not only the exclusive distributor of samsung cis (cmos image sensors) in china, but also the distributor of mcp (multi-chip package) and ap (arn processors) for samsung. those products are widely used in portable electronic devices, like smartphones and tablets. we expect this business to grow substantially in the coming years. because of lack of scale, av concepts soul headphone business is expected to make a small loss in fy14. with geographical expansion and a new product line coming to the market, we expect this business segment to turn around in fy15. given the huge growth opportunities, the mobile internet business may become its key growth driver later. we are optimistic about the near-term earnings outlook and expect earnings to enjoy good growth in the coming two years. in view of its past volatile earnings, we conservatively set our target price at hk$0.84, equivalent to 0.8 times fy14 estimated price to book or four-year average forward pb. initiate buy. mega financial holding companytarget price: twd27 outperformsinopac research (june 10): we have downgraded mega financial holding company (mega fhc), given the lack of strong drivers for further potential earnings upside. with in-line earnings and having factored in the potential earnings dilution from state-owned m&a, we left our target price unchanged as we believe our 1.3 times book value is justified. 1q14 preliminary net profit reached twd8 billion (30% y-o-y) with eps of twd0.65. the growth mainly came from net interest income (nii) with 15% y-o-y growth. net fee income showed a mild growth of 7% y-o-y. considering the asset quality concerns and one time book value cap, which mega fhc has reached 92% in 1q14, loan growth will slow down while a 1-2 bps net interest margin (nim) expansion quarterly would be achievable amid chinas tight liquidity scenario. net fee income showed a mild 7% y-o-y growth as the strong growth from its securities arm (29% y-o-y) was offset by the decline in the banking arm (-5% y-o-y). for the banking arm, despite an 18% y-o-y fees growth from mutual fund sales on the back of stronger stock market performance, significant renminbi depreciation in 1q14 led to plunges in fees from structured products (-61% y-o-y) and wealth management net fee income (-18% y-o-y). we expect sustainable mild growth in net fee income in 2h14. sri rejeki ismantarget price: idr333 buymaybank kim eng (june 11): sritex has ambitious plans to double its production capacity in five years, guided by its garment-focused strategy. it expects this years growth to be driven by h&m for fashion garments and the indonesian military. h&m is expected to order six million pieces in fy14e, which is equivalent to us$30 million in revenue. production capacity has already been allocated for h&m until end-fy14e. the indonesian armed forces, comprising the army and the police, is expected to double its orders from us$25 million in fy13 to us$50 million in fy14e as the army opens up to a two-uniform yearly allotment. production has already started for these higher-margin products. in may, the vietnamese factories of more than 100 taiwanese companies, including textile companies such as texhong textile, were attacked by mobs in an anti-china riot, the most serious in the country in two decades. such unrest in vietnam, a major garment producer, could cause textile buyers to diversify their sourcing to indonesia. texhong is a major competitor of sritex for yarn. management also confirmed that the effective tax rate on current-year profits would drop from the statutory 25% to 20% in fy14e as sritex has met the 40% minimum free-float requirement. we have factored in the lower tax rate into our forecast. singapore post ltdtarget price: s$1.86cimb research (june 11): we hosted cfo ng hin lee and deputy cfo daniel phua at our 4th annual asia pacific conference. discussions centred on the recently announced collaboration with alibaba and its m&a plans. while details of the jv with alibaba have yet to be set in stone, singpost believes that its partnership with alibaba could increase shipment volumes by three to four times. these volumes will come gradually as both parties will need to integrate their back-end systems, and singpost will over time build significant scale across the region, funded by alibabas s$312 million investment and its net cash of s$170 million. singpost has identified indonesia as a key market in southeast asia, where it is lacking sufficient presence. its subsidiary and key logistics arm, quantium solutions, set up a jv in indonesia this year after the government relaxed laws that previously restricted foreign firms from owning a stake in logistics companies. singpost sees more room for growth through m&a in indonesia as the current jv only serves java and there is also a need to establish delivery networks in other parts of the country. a study by emarketer forecasts that b2c e-commerce sales in indonesia will rise by 37% in 2015. singpost offers an attractive dividend yield of 4% and provides potential earnings upside from the collaboration with alibaba and its m&a activities as it expands its regional e-commerce logistics operations. stay invested. vingroup jsctarget price: vnd78,900 buymaybank kim eng (june 10): the market often overlooks vingroups potential due to concerns about its large and complex structure. however, it is one of the easier stocks for foreign investors to buy, with high liquidity and sufficient room for foreign ownership. vingroup is the market leader in many key real estate sectors in vietnam. thanks to the scale of its business, the company has built significant barriers to entry in a highly competitive market with leading market shares across segments, an excellent relationship with the authorities, and a reputation for timely delivery of large-scale projects. any new capital raised by the company in the planned ipo on sgx could be put into new projects to add value to its asset base. on average, it has been adding five projects, or 2,000ha, to its land bank every year for the past three years. we value vingroup at an rnav per share of vnd78,900, a 17% discount from rnav or 20% upside. most of the latent, incremental value not reflected in the book comes from the development properties in its 7,000ha land bank. we believe the valuation is compelling for a market leader with recurring income as downside protection. in our low-case scenario, we value all early-stage development projects using the sales comparison approach. we assume it can only liquidate each of its development projects at the current market value for land in the vicinity. the fair value derived from our low-case scenario analysis is vnd65,700.venture corp ltdfair value: s$8.24 buyocbc investment research (june 12): we believe venture corp (vms) will be able to benefit from the trend of accommodative policies being implemented by major central banks and governments to support economic growth. these measures have been undertaken because although recent macroeconomic data have largely pointed to a recovery, it appears to be modest and still fraught with uncertainties and downside risks. vms expects improving contribution from customers secured in recent years and also the ramp-up of new programmes from a number of existing customers. recent commentaries by some of vms key customers on their outlook have largely affirmed this. however, there are still pockets of weaknesses, especially in emerging markets, which are facing challenging conditions.  with the 10-year us treasury bond yield and 10-year singapore government bond yield still remaining at low levels and economists also lowering their year-end target on where the former should be heading, we view vms 6.7% fy14f dividend yield as an attractive investment proposition. coupled with a forecasted cyclical earnings recovery growth of 8.7% in fy14 and 11.6% in fy15, which would mark its first positive net profit growth since fy10, we deem it appropriate to upgrade vms from hold to buy, with a higher fair value estimate of s$8.24 from s$7.78 previously. this story first appeared in the edge weekly edition of june 16-22, 2014."}, "623": {"date_posted":

in any opportunities to participate in the project or other new power plants on a competitive basis. this came as a negative surprise. in light of the controversy surrounding the award of the project

to call for an open tender for project 4a, albeit on an accelerated basis due to the urgent need for the plant. we expect the project 4a open tender to be completed in three to six months. we are confident that ytl power is capable of winning project 4a in the competitive bidding process, given that: (i) it was the lowest bidder for the previous power plant, project 3b, which was won by 1malaysia development bhd; (ii) its 1bestarinet 4g education project award was similar to project 4a in that the initial directly-negotiated contract with the government was cancelled but ytl power subsequently emerged as the winner of the open tender beating 19 other contenders; and (iii) it has done well in competitive bids worldwide as demonstrated by wessex water in the uk and power seraya

the world reacted positively to the feds commitment to a low-interest rate regime. in the us, the sp 500 and the dow jones industrial average indices gained ground on wednesday after the feds statement. the sp 500 index gained 14.99 points to close at 1,956.98 points while the dow rose 98.13 points to end at 16,906.62. the fbm klci traded in a very narrow range of 11.38 points for the week with volumes of 1.36 billion to 2.04 billion shares traded. the index closed at 1,881.48 yesterday, up 4.9 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like cimb group holdings bhd, digi.com bhd, fgv holdings bhd, genting bhd and sapurakencana petroleum bhd caused the index to rise on some nibbling activities. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the indexs price movements in the next few months following may 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69 (high), 1,802.88 (low) and 1,889.47 (high). the indexs daily signals are positive, as the cci, dmi, macd oscillator and stochastic have issued buy readings. as such, the indexs obvious support levels are seen at 1,845, 1,860 and 1,881, while the resistance level of 1,883 and all-time high of 1,889 will offer some liquidation and profit-taking. its simple moving averages depict a marginal uptrend for its daily, weekly and monthly charts. despite its upbeat chart signals, we believe investors will adopt a range trading tone for the klci. with the very obvious bearish divergence signals on its indicators, currently the chance for a significant upside for the index is greatly diminished. for now, the index will remain rangebound between 1,860 and 1,889. despite the mixed tone for the klci, we are recommending a chart buy on mnrb holdings bhd. on tuesday, mnrbs stock closed at a new 52-week high of rm4.90. for financial year 2014 ended march 31 (fy14), the groups revenue and profit before tax improved by about 3% and 38% year-on-year respectively. the improvement in profit was attributed to an increase in gross premiums and contribution by the companys re-insurance and takaful subsidiaries respectively. mnrb has four core segments, namely investment holding, reinsurance business, takaful business and retakaful business. all business segments reported improved bottom line growth. a check of bloomberg consensus revealed that no research houses have coverage on mnrb. the stock is currently trading at a very attractive historical price-earnings ratio of 6.63 times and its price-to-book value ratio of 0.89 times indicates that it is still trading at a discount to its book value. mnrbs 12-month dividend yield is at a very high of 6.6%. looking at the reported shareholding changes on bloomberg, no major acquisition and disposal of shares were reported recently. mnrbs chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is up. its share price has made an obvious surge since its daily wave-2 low of rm3.75 on may 27, 2014. since that rm3.75 low, mnrb surged to its recent june 2014 high of rm4.90. mnrbs chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to its recent june 2014 high of rm4.90. as it broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of rm4.37 and rm4.70, look to buy mnrb on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term uptrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) are very strong and now depict the firm indications of mnrbs

share price up 102.5% year to date. however, some say the construction outfit turned property developer, which has a strong presence in sabah, needs to have landbank in more locations.  the jq project, announced a year ago, has a gross development value of rm1.8 billion and is a joint venture with landowner suria capital holdings bhd. sbc has exclusive rights to develop the project and will be required to make staggered payments to suria capital for land use. suria capital is entitled to 18% of the gdv, with the balance going to sbc.  the jv with the local-listed port operator is expected to be a significant potential earnings driver, leading to analysts giving the stock a consensus target price of rm4.50.  sbc managing director sia teong heng says the group has a healthy gdv pipeline, rm200 million of which will be launched by year-end. our modest rm200 million launch for financial year 2014 includes phase one of the jq development, the peak collection, kiara east, cantonment exchange and genting vale in the foothills of genting highlands, he says.  sbc has property projects in peninsular malaysia and sabah, with a landbank of about 1,100 acres.  the group is working on several property projects with a combined gdv of rm6.2 billion over the next 10 years. these projects are the jq development, the peak collection in kota kinabalu (gdv: rm500 million), kiara east in jalan ipoh, kuala lumpur (rm1.5 billion) and cantonment exchange also in jalan ipoh (rm200 million), bandar ligamas in batang kali with pkns (rm1.7 billion) and a 50-acre development in batang kali (rm500 million).  nevertheless, despite the large potential gdv contribution from its projects, some are of the view that sbc lacks prime land to grow further and gain a stronger foothold in the property market.  as more property developers expand their landbank, especially in prime locations, sbc has remained in its comfort zone of kota kinabalu, the klang valley and kuantan. sia points out that the group will continue to replenish its landbank in areas it is familiar with. sbc has been focusing on the kota kinabalu property market for over a decade while developing mid-range properties in the klang valley.  sia says the group will continue to see strong contributions from the kota kinabalu property market.  2014 is an exciting year as we push towards the commencement of jq, arguably kota kinabalus most exciting central business district and waterfront transformation project, he says.  jq offers residential towers that are expected to be priced as high as rm1,000 psf, commercial elements going for a maximum of rm1,200 psf and retail lots starting from rm2,000 psf.  the project also has several tourist elements, including an international cruise terminal, a convention centre, a hotel and retail components. at the moment, we are looking forward to the commencement at jesselton quay, since our joint-venture condition precedents have almost been fully met with the landowner, suria capital, just having paid up for the land at the end of april 2014, says sia. despite concerns over slowing demand for property, he believes now is a good time for buyers to look at the market. there is fresh impetus. as the traditional property buying quarters  the second and third quarters  start, people will begin to factor in the significance of inflation-push cost, urban migration and lifestyle as well as demographic changes, he says. he points out that these are the key drivers of property purchases. he adds that the cooling measures by bank negara malaysia will only curb speculators.  pockets of opportunities continue to exist to sustain developers, in terms of better design and affordability as well as genuine demand in undiscovered, old neighbourhoods throughout the country, says sia. cimb researchs nigel foo is of the view that demand will normalise by mid-2014 and strengthen by year-end.  we think that demand will strengthen later in the year as potential buyers realise that property prices will rise before the implementation of the goods and services tax of 6% in april 2015, he says.  nevertheless, he points out that although sbc is able to sustain its high profit margin with its current projects, the group needs to expand further in the klang valley.  sbc is involved in developing affordable, mid-range properties in the klang valley, which enjoy strong demand. its landbank is cheap, which means that the company will be able to sustain its high profit margin, says foo.  however, the company needs to raise its profile in the klang valley. although sbc is a household name in kota kinabalu, not many investors are aware of the company.  he says sbc is a small-cap property company that is worth looking into. he has given the stock an add rating and a target price of rm3.96.  rhb researchs alia arwina is another analyst who sees potential in the stock, with a target price of rm2.98 on the counter.  as one of rhbs 30 small-cap jewels, she says sbc is expected to see long-term earnings growth from its jq development.  earnings over the next five to eight years will likely be underpinned by its jq project. its projects in kiara east and batang kali should also provide the company with steady earnings growth, she adds.  for sbcs financial year ended march 31, 2013, the group posted a higher net profit of rm27.9 million, compared with last years rm22.7 million.  this was achieved on the back of lower revenue of rm126 million, compared with rm153.7 million previously. earnings per share rose to 34 sen in fy2013 from 28

gross development value of rm1.8 billion and is a joint venture with landowner suria capital holdings bhd. sbc has exclusive rights to develop the project and will be required to make staggered payments to suria capital for land use. suria capital is entitled to 18% of the gdv, with the balance going to sbc.  the jv with the local-listed port operator is expected to be a significant potential earnings driver, leading to analysts giving the stock a consensus target price of rm4.50.  sbc managing director sia teong heng says the group has a healthy gdv pipeline, rm200 million of which will be launched by year-end. our modest rm200 million launch for financial year 2014 includes phase one of the jq development, the peak collection, kiara east, cantonment exchange and genting vale in the foothills of genting highlands, he says.  sbc has property projects in peninsular malaysia and sabah, with a landbank of about 1,100 acres.  the group is working on several property projects with a combined gdv of rm6.2 billion over the next 10 years. these projects are the jq development, the peak collection in kota kinabalu (gdv: rm500 million), kiara east in jalan ipoh, kuala lumpur (rm1.5 billion) and cantonment exchange also in jalan ipoh (rm200 million), bandar ligamas in batang kali with pkns (rm1.7 billion) and a 50-acre development in batang kali (rm500 million).  nevertheless, despite the large potential gdv contribution from its projects, some are of the view that sbc lacks prime land to grow further and gain a stronger foothold in the property market.  as more property developers expand their landbank, especially in prime locations, sbc has remained in its comfort zone of kota kinabalu, the klang valley and kuantan. sia points out that the group will continue to replenish its landbank in areas it is familiar with. sbc has been focusing on the kota kinabalu property market for over a decade while developing mid-range properties in the klang valley.  sia says the group will continue to see strong contributions from the kota kinabalu property market.  2014 is an exciting year as we push towards the commencement of jq, arguably kota kinabalus most exciting central business district and waterfront transformation project, he says.  jq offers residential towers that are expected to be priced as high as rm1,000 psf, commercial elements going for a maximum of rm1,200 psf and retail lots starting from rm2,000 psf.  the project also has several tourist elements, including an international cruise terminal, a convention centre, a hotel and retail components. at the moment, we are looking forward to the commencement at jesselton quay, since our joint-venture condition precedents have almost been fully met with the landowner, suria capital, just having paid up for the land at the end of april 2014, says sia. despite concerns over slowing demand for property, he believes now is a good time for buyers to look at the market. there is fresh impetus. as the traditional property buying quarters  the second and third quarters  start, people will begin to factor in the significance of inflation-push cost, urban migration and lifestyle as well as demographic changes, he says. he points out that these are the key drivers of property purchases. he adds that the cooling measures by bank negara malaysia will only curb speculators.  pockets of opportunities continue to exist to sustain developers, in terms of better design and affordability as well as genuine demand in undiscovered, old neighbourhoods throughout the country, says sia. cimb researchs nigel foo is of the view that demand will normalise by mid-2014 and strengthen by year-end.  we think that demand will strengthen later in the year as potential buyers realise that property prices will rise before the implementation of the goods and services tax of 6% in april 2015, he says.  nevertheless, he points out that although sbc is able to sustain its high profit margin with its current projects, the group needs to expand further in the klang valley.  sbc is involved in developing affordable, mid-range properties in the klang valley, which enjoy strong demand. its landbank is cheap, which means that the company will be able to sustain its high profit margin, says foo.  however, the company needs to raise its profile in the klang valley. although sbc is a household name in kota kinabalu, not many investors are aware of the company.  he says sbc is a small-cap property company that is worth looking into. he has given the stock an add rating and a target price of rm3.96.  rhb researchs alia arwina is another analyst who sees potential in the stock, with a target price of rm2.98 on the counter.  as one of rhbs 30 small-cap jewels, she says sbc is expected to see long-term earnings growth from its jq development.  earnings over the next five to eight years will likely be underpinned by its jq project. its projects in kiara east and batang kali should also provide the company with steady earnings growth, she adds.  for sbcs financial year ended march 31, 2013, the group posted a higher net profit of rm27.9 million, compared with last years rm22.7 million.  this was achieved on the back of lower revenue of rm126 million, compared with rm153.7 million previously. earnings per share rose to 34 sen in fy2013 from 28 sen in fy2012. this

gic pte and temasek holdings pte, singapores state-owned investment firms, are set to lead global sovereign investors in acquisitions for a second year, after emerging as the most active in 2013. the us$15.7 billion (rm50.87 billion) spent by both companies accounted for about a third of direct investments by state investors globally last year, according to data compiled by the london-based institutional investors sovereign wealth centre. temasek and one of its units, announced two purchases in march that amounted to us$8.9 billion or 57% what the two companies invested last year, according to data compiled by bloomberg. the acquisitions may set the momentum for temasek and gic, amid signs of a global recovery. us data on exports and consumer confidence released during the present month of may, added to a spate of data showing that the worlds largest economy is gaining steam, heading into the second quarter. i wouldnt be surprised if gic and temasek beat last years level of investments, said song seng wun, a singapore-based economist at cimb group holdings bhd. the global recovery is becoming more entrenched. investors should buy assets before they get more expensive, and gic and temasek are faster than other state funds, in seizing the opportunities. direct investments refer to strategic acquisitions, rather than investments made as part of an index-linked portfolio, usually intermediated by an asset manager or bank, according to the sovereign wealth center. temasek in march, agreed to buy a 25% stake in the retail arm of hutchison whampoa ltd for hk$44 billion (rm18.3 billion), and one of its units in the same month, offered to take over olam international ltd, in a deal that values the commodity trader at s$5.3 billion (rm13.7 billion). gic was part of a group that bought the time warner headquarters in new york for us$1.3 billion in january. the combined us$15.7 billion spent last year by gic and temasek, accounted for 32% of all transactions among their peers, according to the sovereign wealth centre. thats the biggest share of all direct investments by state investors, the data showed. it dwarfs the percentage of investments by state funds of norway, abu dhabi and china, according to the sovereign wealth centres website. norways state fund, the worlds biggest, deployed us$5.3 billion last year and china investment corp, us$1.9 billion, according to the research. temasek is set up as a holding company, and mergers and acquisitions are where its expertise lies, said enrico soddu, an analyst at the sovereign wealth centre. gic has been increasing its direct investments only recently, in line with the insourcing trend among sovereign funds to save on fees to asset management companies, but also because their capabilities have grown, he said. soddu added that the increase in transactions this year is not surprising, because they will mainly stem from the two large deals by temasek and also because 2013 was a relatively quiet year. the total value of the 184 direct investments by sovereign wealth funds in 2013, reached us$43.5 billion  23% less from the previous year in value  mainly in line with a drop in cross-border mergers and acquisitions, according to the data. in 2012, the qatar investment authority was the biggest sovereign investor worldwide, with a share of 32% of global investments, equalling us$16.4 billion, according to data by the sovereign wealth centre. gic made 40 direct investments last year and temasek 38, the data showed. among gics major transactions in 2013 were the purchase of a 50% stake in londons broadgate office complex and the acquisition of a 28.5% stake in goldman sachs group incs european insurance business. temasek bought a 5.04% stake in spanish oil company, repsol sa, for u20ac1 billion (rm4.42 billion) last year. the firms liquefied natural gas unit, pavilion energy pte, in november, said it would pay us$1.3 billion for a 20% stake in three gas blocks offshore tanzania in east africa. this years purchase of the stake in as watson & co, the retail arm of billionaire li ka-shings hutchison whampoa ltd, was temaseks biggest so far, and gives the singapore state-owned investment company, a stake in a business, with more than 10,000 stores worldwide. breedens investments pte, the wholly-owned unit of temasek offering for the shares in olam, on april 29 said that 10.3% of the shareholders already accepted the offer. if breedens bought all the shares not already owned at the time of the offer by a temasek unit, it could pay as much as s$4 billion. temasek and its unit, seatown holdings international, together with investment firm, rrj capital ltd, agreed to invest in nn group, the insurance business of dutch lender ing groep nv, according to a april 30 statement by ing. temasek and seatown are contributing a combined u20ac525 million, according to the statement. temaseks holdings jumped to a record s$215 billion in the year ended march 2013, as surging global stock markets bolstered assets. the firm is the ninth biggest state investor, with an estimated us$173 billion of assets. its total investments were s$20 billion in the 12 months ended march 31, 2013, according to the singapore investment firms latest annual report, published in july. thats more than double the amount invested four years earlier. gic

endorsement have been obtained,\" it said. malaysian airline system bhd's (mas) first-quarter earnings released on thursday is set to show how badly the disappearance of mh370 on march 8 affected the carrier's finances. the airline unveiled a business plan in late 2011 with the aim of turning a profit by 2013, by ending unprofitable routes and investing in new aircraft. however, mas reported an annual loss for the past three years, prompting a change in direction. reuters reported last week that mas is in talks with banks for a strategic overhaul, which may include the partial sale of its engineering unit and an upgrade of its ageing fleet. struggling to cope with high costs and nimbler regional and international rivals, mas' quarterly performance has been made so uncertain by reduced traffic and potential costs linked to the jet's unexplained disappearance that analysts say they simply can't issue january-march estimates. the carrier known as mas reported a net loss of 343 million malaysian ringgit ($106 million) for the last quarter of 2013, squeezed between airasia bhd on short-haul routes, and gulf carriers and airasia x in the medium and long-haul market. the first-quarter numbers are expected after the close of trading on the malaysian stock exchange on thursday. its worst quarter on record was in october-december 2011, when a series of one-off provisions related to jet deliveries and maintenance pushed it to a 1.28 billion ringgit net loss. the airline said last month that passenger numbers dropped sharply after mh370's disappearance, its load factor - or percentage of seats sold - slipping to 74.1 percent, close to january 2013's record monthly low of 73.9 percent. analysts expect the uncertainty over mh370 to continue to deter travelers from using the airline, 69 percent-owned by malaysian state investor khazanah. \"if there is new political will to restructure, mas can be saved from itself, and our forecasts, target price, and perhaps even our recommendation may be raised,\" cimb said in a report this week. but the brokerage, which has a 'reduce' rating on the shares, said the path forward remains risky. analysts have long urged change at the carrier. as part of a strategic overhaul of the company, mas is looking to sell a stake in its profitable aircraft maintenance unit, sources told reuters this week. uncertain times regular customers like ray tan highlight the problem facing mas. for the past two years, the singapore-based technology executive flew mas for business trips to kuala lumpur every fortnight. since flight mh370 disappeared, though, he has shunned the airline. \"if it's just the incident alone, i would think it's an isolated one, but right after it, there were a couple more breakdowns with the planes and that kind of really eroded confidence i had for mas,\" said the 31-year-old, who won't even take the airline for leisure now. since last year, mas has adopted a strategy of lowering fares to try and bolster traffic. yet hampered by a strong trade union, it has also been unable to slash costs and improve productivity. analysts have argued that bringing in private investment and reducing the role of state investor khazanah might promote change at the airline, improving competitiveness. that prospect appears remote. khazanah attempted to cut its stake in mas in 2012, but the airline's main union successfully blocked a share swap deal with airasia that would have brought in a profitable airline with experience of competing aggressively. \"their operating costs are still so high, they need to relook at the business model,\" said kuala lumpur-based ang kok heng, chief investment officer at phillip capital. \"whatever restructuring they go through, they will have to overcome union opposition which is very difficult to do.\" with no near-term improvement seen, investors including khazanah may see the value of their holdings further eroded. since mh370 disappeared, mas shares have slumped as much as 20 percent. its market value has tumbled about 80 percent over the past five years, while the broader malaysian market has risen about 80 percent.

however, as the companys selling prices are renewed quarterly with its major multinational corporation (mnc) customers (70% turnover), 2qfy14 profit margin should recover if the raw material prices stabilise in the current quarter.  a continued rise in raw material costs in 2qfy14 will be negative for the company. daibochi has started using energy-saving devices, and will be able to cut its electricity costs by 50%. the company will accelerate the full installation of these devices by end-2014, which will result in full cost savings from fy15. demand for the companys products remains strong, particularly in the export market. it started commercial production for a global mnc food and beverage player from 3qfy13 and could see more orders from this customer in the next few months.  we upgraded daibochi to add from hold last november. however, since the start of the year, its share price has risen 8% versus the klcis flat performance and ftse bursa malaysia small cap indexs 10% gain.  the stocks valuation is not cheap anymore as it is trading above the sectors 2015 thirteen times price-earnings ratio target.  downside risks could come from continued raw material price increases in the current quarter. as such, we downgrade the stock to hold from add.  cimb research, may 14 this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on may 15, 2014."}, "655":

after a court ordered yingluck to step down after finding her guilty of abuse of power. thailand's consumer confidence fell for the thirteenth month in april, reflecting worries about the prolonged political uncertainty. the thai stock market was asia's second-worst performer on the day after vietnam, which was the worst, thomson reuters data showed. \"it's no surprise that the political

shares.  we\ndowngrade the stock to hold from add following the 154% share price\noutperformance versus the klci since our double upgrade in november 2010, said\ncimb in a note today. the\ngroup reported net profit of rm155.1 million for 1qfy14, down 35% year-on-year,\ndespite y-o-y revenue growth of 9% to rm8.29 billion. we\nare encouraged by petronas dagangan's topline growth, which continued to\nbenefit from a wider network of petrol stations and higher demand for key\nnon-retail products, in particular lpg and jet fuel.  however,\nthe topline expansion was achieved at the

announced a single-tier interim dividend of 12 sen per share,\nwhich is lower than the usual quarterly dividend of 13.1 sen per share. despite\nthe weaker performance in 1qfy14, cimb said the companys

bearish divergence on the fbm klci that indicated a weak bullish momentum and that the klci was expected to consolidate sideways between 1,850 and 1,870 points. jittery and mixed performances at global markets caused investors and traders to be cautious, especially about slower china economic growth. the market was also directionless in the past one week. the klci was almost unchanged in a week, rising only a point to 1,860.43 points after trading in a range of between 1,852.27 and 1,871.69 points. being cautious, trading volume continued to decline and this time it was drastic. the average daily trading volume in the past one week was only 1.5 billion shares compared with 2.3 billion shares two weeks ago. the average trading value was at rm1.7 billion compared with rm2.0 billion two weeks ago, indicating that institutions were probably the main players on bursa malaysia in the past one week as higher priced stocks were being traded. foreign institutions continued to be net buyers from last monday to friday. the stronger ringgit may be the catalyst for foreign buying. net buying from foreign institutions amounted to rm402.4 million while net selling by local institutions and retail investors came to rm288.6 and rm113.8 million respectively. in the klci, gainers marginally beat decliners 16 to 13. gainers were led by digi.com bhd (+3.0%), astro malaysia holdings bhd

against the us dollar from 3.26 last week to 3.25. crude palm oil continued to be pressured, falling 2.7% in a week and 10% in two months to rm2,568 per tonne yesterday. the klci has remained in a sideways correction of a short-term uptrend and has formed a triangle chart pattern. the index has pulled back to slightly above the 30-day moving average. the index is still bullish in the long term and there are no signs that the trend may change except for the weaker bullish momentum in the short term. the short-term or immediate support level is at 1,845 points. the immediate resistance level is at 1,870 points. the bullish trend should be able to continue if the index is able to break above the immediate resistance level. however, the weak momentum indicates that the possibility of the index climbing higher is low. momentum indicators like the rsi and macd are still in a divergence against the klci and this indicates that the resistance is getting stronger and hence the weaker bullish momentum. the bollinger bands is contracting and the index is at the middle band of this indicator. this indicates uncertainty. the market is hanging in a balance between the bull and the bear. the indicators basically show that the market is uncertain. however, this will change if the index breaks above the resistance level of 1,870 points or below the support level of 1,845 points.a breakout above 1,870 points will confirm the triangle chart pattern with a target of 1,900 points. a break below 1,845 points will cause confidence to weaken and the next support level the index will test is 1,800 points. continue to expect the klci to consolidate further between 1,850 and 1,870 points with a bias towards the lower level because of the rising resistance. benny lee is chief market

concerns", "article": " kuala lumpur: the drastic share price plunge of four small-cap stocks  visdynamics holdings bhd, mnc wireless bhd, industronics bhd and solution engineering holdings bhd  over the past two trading days has raised concerns over their fundamentals among analysts and fund managers. visdynamics share price dropped the most among the four stocks yesterday, tumbling by 41.49% or 19.5 sen to end at 27.5 sen. the stock opened at 17 sen, also its intra-day low. on monday, it lost 39% or 30 sen to close at 47 sen. industronics shares extended their losses to end 15.58% or six sen down to 32.5 sen yesterday. the stock dropped 43.8% to 38.5 sen on monday to hit limit down. however, share prices of mnc wireless and solution engineering recovered from their monday losses to rise 16.67% and 7.69% to 17.5 sen and 14 sen respectively. mnc wireless topped the losers list on monday, falling 60.5% or 23 sen to close at 15 sen, while solution engineering shares slid 52.7% to 13 sen. the fbm klci rose marginally by 0.19% or 3.6 points to 1,859.34 yesterday. eastspring investments bhd fund manager tung yin wai said it is time for investors to revisit the fundamentals of these stocks, and to replace them with those that have good fundamentals. even though some of these stocks tend to be illiquid, they would not plunge that much, he said. a [share price] plunge of below 10% is acceptable [for fundamentally sound stocks]. we rarely see a 50% plunge, tung told the edge financial daily yesterday.  cimb research senior analyst nigel foo, who tracks small- to mid-cap stocks, said: my guess is that some of these penny stocks have gone up quite a lot without any fundamentals.  foo is of the view that the heavy selling in the four small-cap stocks was due to a clampdown by stock broking houses and banks, which are lenders of these share margins, on these stocks. sj securities senior remisier goh kay chong concurred. he noted that as a result of lenders of credit starting to pull the line in margin financing, investors or speculators would have to sell down.  when asked if a similar scenario would be seen in other small-cap stocks, he said it all depends on the lenders of credit whether they feel comfortable to continue extending the line of credit. he is of the view that some syndicates might be behind this, where the playing of these stocks in a basket belongs to the same group of people.  goh deems the four stocks share price plunge as unusual, adding that he had noted money flowing out of these stocks in the first two weeks of april, based on what is seen in the technical charts. based on technical analysis, there are weaknesses in these stocks [visdynamics, mnc wireless, industronics and solution engineering] based on money flow index and the institutional behaviour, he said. financially, the four firms are also not doing so well. visdynamics, a manufacturer of automated test equipment, saw its net loss widen to rm2.4 million for the financial year ended oct 30, 2013 (fy13) from rm438,000 a year ago. revenue also fell to rm3.62 million from rm9.75 million in fy12. however, its financial performance improved in the first quarter ended jan 31, 2014, boosted by segment revenue coming in from north asia.  industronics, which designs, manufactures and installs electronics and microprocessor controlled products, also saw its net loss double to rm4.04 million for fy13 ended dec 31 from rm2.24 million the previous year, while revenue dropped to rm42.8 million from rm50.7 million.  mnc wireless, a mobile technology firm, also posted a net loss of rm1.63 million for its fy13 ended dec 31, but smaller than the rm3.85 million net loss in the previous year. revenue dipped marginally to rm13.06 million from rm13.54 million. in a reply to bursa malaysias query yesterday, industronics said it was unaware of the reasons for the fall in its share price, but added that it is exploring a proposal for a corporate restructuring. it stated that the proposal for the internal reorganisation of the group is preliminary in nature. meanwhile, in separate filings, mnc wireless and visdynamic said they were unaware of any corporate development in their companies which might have triggered the sharp decline in their share price. solution engineering, which is 7.84% owned by industronics, was the only company among the four that was not slapped with an unusual market activity query by bursa, and the only company which showed the most improvement in its latest financial results. for the 12 months ended dec 31, 2013, it

fundamentals of these stocks, and to replace them with those that have good fundamentals. even though some of these stocks tend to be illiquid, they would not plunge that much, he said. a [share

was due to a clampdown by stock broking houses and banks, which are lenders of these share margins, on these stocks. sj securities senior remisier goh kay chong concurred. he noted that as a result of lenders of credit starting to pull the line in margin financing, investors or speculators would have to sell down.  when asked if a similar scenario would be seen in other small-cap stocks, he said it all depends on the lenders of credit whether they feel comfortable to continue extending the line of credit. he is of the view that some syndicates might be behind this, where the playing of these stocks in a basket belongs to the same group of people.  goh deems the four stocks share price plunge as unusual, adding that he had noted money flowing out of these stocks in the first two weeks of

money flow index and the institutional behaviour, he said. financially, the four firms are also not doing so well. visdynamics, a manufacturer of automated test equipment, saw its net loss widen to

in the first quarter ended jan 31, 2014, boosted by segment revenue coming in from north asia.  industronics, which designs, manufactures and installs electronics and microprocessor controlled products, also saw its net loss double to rm4.04 million for fy13 ended dec 31 from rm2.24 million the previous year, while revenue dropped to rm42.8 million from rm50.7 million.  mnc wireless, a

for a corporate restructuring. it stated that the proposal for the internal reorganisation of the group is preliminary in nature. meanwhile, in separate filings, mnc wireless and visdynamic said they were unaware of any corporate development in their companies which might have triggered the sharp decline in their share price. solution engineering, which is 7.84% owned by industronics, was the only company among the four that was not slapped with an unusual market activity query by bursa, and the only company which showed the most improvement in its latest financial results. for the 12 months

to be around 9.5%-10% this year. last year, the business loan momentum was adversely impacted by the weakening of business sentiment prior to the general elections in may 13, although it recovered in 2h13, ngs comments came in a note following a recent banking roadshow by cimb in taiwan which focused primarily on topics such as islamic banking (ib), sector backgrounds and stock picks. he added that although there is significant interest in ib, things could take time to materialise as there is still a lack of infrastructure and comprehensive legal framework in these countries to support ib

call and target price of rm2: our target price is based on a 20% discount to revised net asset value and offers an upside potential of 29%. a group-wide privatisation exercise could act as a key catalyst for the stock, while the express rail link (erl) extension to klia2 and new capacity at ytl cement bhd (ytlc) are immediate earnings drivers. ytl is believed to have gone ex-growth because of its size and reliance on ytl power international bhd (ytlp) for its earnings. not only did it manage to deliver an earnings compound annual growth rate (cagr) of 14.7% over financial year 2010 ended june 30 (fy10) to fy13, but the contribution of ytlp to its bottom line also fell from 73% to 48% during the same period. this was mainly due to the privatisation of ytlc but the trend in earnings rebalancing and growth is expected to continue with 30% more capacity at ytlc kicking in and the extension of the erl to klia2 expected to increase ridership levels by 36%. both these cumulative factors are the reasons why our fy15 earnings per share estimate is 14% above consensus. we forecast an earnings cagr of 7.7% over the next three years, largely capped by the decommissioning of ytlps malaysian power plants in fy16 in the event its power purchase agreement is not renewed. however, we are more than confident that ytl will be able to fill the vacuum with a new stream of earnings. the privatisation of ytlc illustrated how much value ytl can unlock with restructuring. if ytl repeats the same share swap exercise for its remaining listed subsidiaries  ytlp, ytl land & development bhd and ytl e-solutions bhd  we estimate a potential fy15 earnings per share accretion of 8.9%, with return on equities improving from 10.9% to 12.3% and dividend per share almost doubling. ytls valuations are likely to significantly rerate if all three subsidiaries are folded into one singular entity.  cimb research, april 22 this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on april

rm7.75: cimb groups thai unit, cimb thai bank plc, saw its net profit for the first quarter ended march 31 of financial year 2014 (1qfy14) rising 40.8% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 440.7 million baht (rm44.4 million) driven primarily by more robust top line contribution from non-interest income, which saw sharper gains on foreign exchange (forex) and investments. as these gains are deemed non-recurring, we believe the robust earnings will taper off in the coming quarters. based on our fy14 net profit forecast of rm4,866.5 million for cimb group, the thai units annualised results amount to a share of about 9% and is ahead of our forecast, which is close to 8% of groups earnings. among others, the key operating income drivers for cimb thais 1qfy14 results were a 27% y-o-y expansion in net interest income, underpinned by early redemption of hybrid instruments and improved net interest margins to 3.27% from 3.18% y-o-y, net fee and services income growth of 23.1% y-o-y, and a robust 106% expansion in non-interest income, on the back of a 137% gain in forex profit and a fourfold increase in investment gain of 200 million baht. asset quality however saw some deterioration as a result of thailands economic slowdown and an increase in certain sizeable corporate accounts (which do not represent the overall trend) and retail defaults. hence, there was an uptick in gross non-performing loans ratio to 3.1% at end-1qfy14, from 2.5% at end-4qfy13 and 2.8% at end-fy12. as a result of this, the loan loss coverage ratio decreased to 100.6% in 1qfy14 from 107.8% in 4qfy13 though the group had stepped up gross provisions for the period. on a positive note, the capital adequacy of cimb thai remains well above regulatory requirement subsequent to the capital injection last year  tier-1 capital stood at 10.1% while the group bis (bank for international settlements) ratio stood at 13.4% in 1qfy14. our target price for cimb group remains unchanged at rm7.75, based on an fy15e return on equity of 13.6%, a cost of equity of 11.2% and a growth rate of 7%, which translates into a price-to-book value (p/bv) multiple of 1.56 times. at rm7.39, the stock remains undervalued, as implied by fy14e and fy15e p/bvs of 1.6 times and 1.5 times respectively, which are below its seven-year forward average of 1.9 times. meanwhile, foreign shareholdings have continued to decline and stood at 33.4% (as at end-march 2014) from a high of 42.7% in may 2013. despite regulatory curbs on loose credit, we view a recovery in regional trade and the healthy level of private investments as rerating catalysts for stronger 2014 and 2015 business loan growth.  affin investment bank, april 21 this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on april 22, 2014."},

adding to its sugar cane, palm oil and rubber plantations, chief executive officer nguyen van su said in an april 16 interview. the company is also pursuing deals to sell its rubber to michelin cgde

exchange next year to raise capital for further expansion and meet terms of convertible and non-convertible bond sales to temasek holdings pte and credit suisse group ag, su said, without giving a target price. the farming division is valued at more than $1 billion, said nguyen the anh, ho chi minh city-based analyst at cimb securities vietnam. commodities transformation a singapore listing would make hagl the second vietnam- based company to trade in the country, according to data compiled by bloomberg. the companys transformation from a real estate company to the countrys largest owner of agricultural land, with crops in vietnam, cambodia and laos, in just a few years is a good sign, anh of cimb securities said. real estate accounts for 6 percent of the companys revenue today and is expected to drop to 200 billion dong ($9.5 million) in 2014, down from 247 billion dong last year, according to a company statement released april 18 at the annual shareholders meeting. hagl, which has said it has 100,000 hectares under cultivation, counted on real estate and rubber for about 74 percent of revenue in 2012, according to data compiled by bloomberg. the pleiku, vietnam-based company forecasts a 50 percent jump in 2014 after-tax profit to 1.46 trillion dong, according to a statement from hagl. listing on the singapore exchange will make it easier for investors to trade our

percent as of 9:46am local time. the company is relying on crops such as corn to generate cash quickly while newly planted rubber trees grow to maturity and become productive. revenue from sugar cane, about 34 percent of total sales, is forecast to increase to 1.1 trillion dong this year, up from 838 billion last year, according to an april 18 statement. rubber trees, which take about six years to reach maturity, are expected to generate 341 billion dong this year, or 10 percent of total revenue. revenue from the companys newest crop, corn, is expected to be 300 billion dong in 2014. the company is also relying on quicker crops as rubber prices have declined to a more than four-year low. rubber glut rubber futures traded in tokyo have fallen 25 percent this year and closed at 206.4 yen a kilogram on april 18, the lowest settlement since october 2009. prices slumped as the global surplus expanded. the glut will be 78 percent more than estimated in december as demand slows and production in thailand exceeds forecasts, according to the rubber economist ltd., a london-based industry adviser. the company forecasts 2014 revenue will rise to 3.4 trillion dong, it reported in the shareholders meeting document. that compares with 2.8 trillion dong last year, according to data compiled by bloomberg. we started to have revenue and profit from agriculture beginning in 2013, duc said at the shareholders meeting last week. over the 2008-2013 period, we just spent money on the sector and didnt get income. when the company began to exit vietnams property market in 2009-2010, its

kuala lumpur: pipe manufacturers are once again in the spotlight, with engtex group bhd being a frontrunner for the potential rm200 million pipe supply contract for the langat 2 water treatment plant (wtp) project, said analysts. last wednesday pengurusan asset air bhd, the national water asset management company, awarded the long-awaited langat 2 wtp contract to a consortium comprising salcon bhd, mmc corp bhd and ahmad zaki resources bhd. the langat 2 wtp contract is worth rm994 million for the first phase, with the companies in the consortium holding stakes of 36%, 34% and 30% respectively engtex, which is the only listed pipe manufacturer that has been a supplier to all the three winning contractors, is seen to be a frontrunner for the langat 2 pipe contract. tender estimated at 20% of the rm994 million project value is likely to be called by the joint-venture (jv) company as pipe contract, and this is likely to happen in the next three months, said cimb researchs sharizan rosely. he is of the view that the tender is likely to be called by the jv contractor soon, adding that the development order is expected to be granted as early as the second half of this year. as the pipe supply contract for the langat 2 wtp will be restricted to pipes of larger diameter  with specifications of between 1.6m and 2.2m in diameter  this narrows the possible winners. sharizan pointed out that there are only two local pipe manufacturers that have the capacity to mass produce up to 500km of pipes with larger specifications  boon & cheah steel pipes sdn bhd and engtex group. the group (engtex) should command a good chance of winning, in our view, even if the rm200 million pipe contract is split between the two players, said sharizan. he highlighted that engtex still has ample capacity to handle orders for langat 2 wtp, without the need to undertake a major expansion. the groups overall average plant utilisation rates for both ductile iron and mild steel pipes have been running at a profitable level of 30% to 53% over the last five years, he said. meanwhile, another analyst from a local brokerage pointed out that investors had shown interest in engtex, resulting in the share price of the company to spike 225.2% from last may to its all-time high of rm2.10 last friday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm412.93 million. the stock had been trading at a weighted average of 90 sen in the past two years. our fair value for the stock is as high as rm2.65. its current level suggests a 26% upside potential, the analyst told the edge financial daily. taking on a landmark water contract, which is the largest single water contract in malaysia, will bode well for engtex. it has the capacity to do so and this will instil confidence for other future projects, she said. she pointed out that engtex, being the largest player in malaysia for the duopolistic ductile iron sector, is a stock worth investing, as there are also other growth contributors in the pipeline. going forward, we also see engtex as a frontrunner for the pipe orders for iskandars rapid project, she added. this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on

currently, the market in the us is in the process of unwinding, with prices retracing, amid the occasional thematic sell-off, such as that witnessed last week (april 07-11), with the technology sector

charge (psc) at klia2 would be the same as that currently charged at the low-cost carrier terminal (lcct). he, however, said it would be treated as a promotional rate for the first year only, with the possibility of an upward revision after that.  this was one of the rare occasions the government had publically acknowledged its move to narrow down or close the psc tariff gap between the main terminal building (mtb) and klia2. the deputy ministers statement was not entirely a surprise, as we had already highlighted this potential in our nov 21, 2013 report.  the current psc for international flights is rm65 at the mtb against rm32 at the lcct. for domestic flights, it is rm9 at the mtb versus rm6 at the lcct.  if the psc increases, airasia will most likely have to cut its fares to keep the cost of travel down. its fares (excluding ancillary) averaged rm166 per pax in 2013. when singapores budget terminal was shut in september 2012, tiger airways saw an increase in its psc from s$18 to s$34 per pax. tiger only managed to pass through 60% of this increase, absorbing the remaining 40% by way of lower fares, causing  in our estimation  a deterioration in yields and earnings.  separately, acting transport minister datuk seri hishammuddin hussein said he had directed the international civil aviation organisation (icao) to perform safety checks on kliaa2, probably in response to airasias concerns on safety issues, but he sounded very unhappy with airasias demands.  with its relations with the government frayed, airasia will not be able to easily convince the government not to proceed with the tariff equalisation moves between klia2 and mtb. airasia was given a reprieve when the 9% to 10% psc hike in february 2014 was put on hold, but it may not be so lucky in 2015. another risk is the imposition of the 6% goods and services tax (gst) on domestic flights from april 1, 2015, which could deflate airasias fares.  we maintain our hold call on airasia, with an unchanged target price of rm2.40, based on its liquidation value. while airasias share price is now below our target, we see few catalysts for the stock due to yields remaining weak over the next year as the industry is not rationalising excess capacity.  cimb research, april 14 this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on april 15, 2014."}, "682": {"date_posted":

from malaysian equity amounted to rm5.55 billion as of last week. however, this was a 20% reduction from the cumulative peak of rm6.9 billion. zulkifli said wall street remains the worlds bellwether market for equity. currently, the market in the us is in the process of unwinding, with prices retracing amid the occasional thematic sell-off, such as that witnessed last week with the technology sector rout. he is cautious over the impact of wall street activity. the earnings reporting season for 1q14 financials may turn unsavoury if many companies reports fall behind expectations. the sell-off of technology stocks last week, amid worries over earnings, is probably a taste of things to come. the market is heading into may, which is historically not a good month for wall street.  he said uncertainty on wall street may be the catalyst for funds to hunt for value elsewhere, and asia appears to be a prime target as seen by the flow of fund data in the past few weeks. however, the risk of a reversal also heightens, said zulkifli. this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on april 15, 2014."}, "683": {"date_posted": "14/4/2014", "title": "#brokers digest* local

research (sept 25): in 1qfy2013, we expect glomac to record strong net profit growth of 18% y-o-y to rm20 million to rm22 million, 20% of our full-year estimates, driven by record unbilled sales of rm731 million at end-fy2012. however, q-o-q growth will likely be flat or marginally softer. overall operating margins should stay above 20% on greater contributions from the high-margin glomac damansara. glomacs 1qfy2013 results are likely to meet our expectations.  we maintain our earnings forecasts and rm1.10 target price (40% discount to revised net asset value) for now. our buy call is based on a 12-month investment horizon. as at april, township projects (including glomac puchong and the newly acquired ijok and dengkil land) account for 82% of glomacs rm5.8 billion in remaining gross development value, providing a strong base for future earnings. glomac is trading at a steep 30% discount to its nta (as at april) and 57% discount to our rm1.82 rnav. it also offers an attractive reit-like net yield of 5.6% (compared with large-cap reits 5%). airasia x bhdtarget price: rm0.75 neutral alliance research (march 31): we remain cautious on airasia xs (aax) yield in fy14 as we believe it will continue to face intense competition in the australian routes in the near term following substantial additional capacity by both aax and malaysian airline system bhd in 3qfy13. this is in line with the managements guidance that pressure on its australian yields is expected to persist over the next few quarters.  we are concerned about the potential spill-over effect from the recent mh370 tragedy as it may lead to aversion among chinese tourists to visit malaysia, which may drag aaxs yields further. as such, we are tweaking our yields growth assumption downwards to 2% in fy14 from 5% which was too optimistic, considering the recent developments.  we still believe that aaxs yields will rise slightly in fy14 due to the withdrawal of the poor-yielding maldives route that had affected yields in 4qfy13 and improvement in its jeddah yields as travel demand normalises. we expect aaxs yields to increase by 5% in fy15 following its relocation to klia2.  cypark resources bhd target price: rm3.09 add cimb research (march 31): revenue growth for 1qf14 was flattish as it only grew by 1% to rm51.5 million. this was due to lower revenue from its environmental engineering that declined by 3.6%, but was balanced out by landscaping and renewable energy (re) for which revenues grew by 66% and 72% respectively.  we had previously highlighted that the sustainable energy development authority (seda) was expected to release its new re quota under the feed-in-tariff programme (fit) by the end of march. however, news reports suggest that the new quota is only expected by april. cypark is aiming for at least another 10mw of new re quota from seda. 1malaysia development bhds move (1mdb) to be the first to build a solar power plant outside of the fit quota is positive for cypark, as this means that it too can propose a similar project, given its current status as the largest re player in malaysia. a mega solar farm such as 1mdbs 50mw would almost double cyparks end-fy14 re capacity target of 50mw.petronas gas bhdtarget price: rm21.98 neutral rhb research (april 1): petronas gas (petgas) has entered into a new 20-year gas sale agreement with petronas,

services agreement. the new gpa includes gta sabah for the additional gas transport services provided to petronas for its customers in kimanis that started in january 2014. the new agreements allow

international holdings, the majority shareholder of jti malaysia, has made a buyout offer of rm808.5 million for the remaining 39.6% stake of jti.  we are pleasantly surprised by the privatisation offer price, which is significantly higher than our previous dividend-discount-model- (ddm) derived target price of rm6. in addition to the offer price, this represents a 20% premium to jtis pre-suspension price and a 21% premium to jtis six-month volume weighted average price trading of shares. at rm7.80 per share, jti is being valued at a 15 times fy15 2015 estimation eps and a cy14 estimation per-nta of 5.7 times as at end-december 2013.  in view of the challenging prospects for the tobacco industry and the strong offer on hand, we think that there is no reason for minorities to reject the deal. while we upgrade the stock to buy and raise our ddm-based target to rm7.80, we expect the stock to trade near its offer price upon re-quotation.  astro malaysia holdings bhdtarget price: rm3.60 buy hwangdbs vickers research (april 1): astro malaysia holdings fy14 earnings of rm448 million is within our and consensus expectations at 96% and 98% of respective earnings estimates.  astro will continue to enjoy average revenue per user uplift from improving take-up of b.yond hd channels as well as full-year recognition of package price increases. this would also be bolstered by full-year recognition of revenue from astros barclays premier league channel-supply partnership with telekom malaysia bhd. margins are expected to be resilient as its set-up box swap-out exercise eases and depreciation tapers off in the longer term. its share of advertising expenditure in the overall market is also steadily rising, which will add to its strong subscription revenue. the stock offers bright earnings growth prospects in a fairly defensive market, and could surprise on the back of utilisation of new transponder capacity through its satellite launch, which is expected in 2q14.  eastern & oriental bhdfair value: rm3 buy amresearch (april 3): we reaffirm our buy recommendation on eastern & oriental (e&o) with an unchanged fair value of rm3 per share  a 35% discount to our nav of rm4.61 per share, including the significant accretion from seri tanjung pinang 2 (stp2).  a local daily reported that e&os share price has risen to reflect the progress in stp2 and the timeline of events of its stp project. our key investment thesis on e&o is centred on the crystallisation of stp2 given the tripling of nav and the deep development potential of the 760-acre prime land. e&o is awaiting the department of environments approval for the detailed environment impact assessment study on the commencement of reclamation works on stp2. we recommend that investors accumulate e&o ahead of the sustained news flow momentum as stp2 moves closer to realisation. this may lead to a narrowing of the current nav discount of 52% via an accelerated share price discovery of its fair value.padini holdings bhdtarget price: rm2.40 buy hwang dbs vickers research (april 3): padini plans to open three brands outlet (bo) and two padini concept stores (pcs) before end-june. this will add 40,000 sq ft to 50,000 sq ft of floor area to take total new area to 96,000 sq ft to 120,000 sq ft in fy14. going forward, padini wants to open at least five outlets a year. we raised fy15 to fy16 forecast eps by 3% to 8% after imputing larger earnings contribution from bo and pcs. the near-term earnings growth driver will likely be bo. bo focuses on offering a wide variety of value-for-money products targeted at the low- to middle-income consumers. we believe bo margins are higher given fitting cost is 45% lower than pcs. bo has an impressive track record with five-year pbt cagr of 118%. bo contributed 25% of fy13 revenue. current valuation is attractive at 11 times fy15 eps given the resilient earnings, continuous expansion plans, 25% return on equity and a strong balance sheet. dividends could surprise as expanding bo generally requires lower capital expenditure and costs. our 70% payout ratio for fy14f implies 5% yield. sentoria group bhdtarget price: rm1.20 buy ta securities (april 2): last year was eventful for sentoria group as it has proposed two massive integrated resort cities in morib and kuching. the group should see busy years ahead given that bandar samariang and morib bay will commence in 2014 and 2015 respectively. we like sentorias synergistic business model, which allows it to enjoy earnings upside from property development and at the same time, benefit from its strong cash-generating leisure and hospitality business.  sentoria is operating in two business divisions, namely property development and leisure and hospitality. the group has around 1,500 acres of undeveloped landbank with an estimated gross development value of rm6.6 billion. the groups leisure and hospitality operation consists of two theme parks and two resorts within bukit gambang resort city. our target price is at a 38% discount to the groups fully-diluted rnav of rm1.95 per share. there could be further upside to rnav as we have conservatively assumed a 70% take-up rate for properties in morib bay rc and borneo samariang rc.sapurakencana petroleum bhdtarget price: rm5.36 buy midf research (april 2): sapurakencana petroleum has bagged one fresh contract and three contract extensions. the newly secured jobs are worth a collective us$454 million. although we have factored in these potential job wins, we are taking this opportunity to adjust our fy15 earnings estimates slightly higher by 2.4%. we are assuming lower financing costs from the recently undertaken debt restructuring exercise and also a higher fleet utilisation rate of over 65%. sapurakencanas order book remains strong at us$8.3 billion. broken down geographically, 49% of the jobs are from brazil, 31% from malaysia, 14% from southeast asia, 5% from australia and the rest from africa. tender book value is almost similar to the current order book at rm25 billion.we are still bullish on sapurakencana and we are reiterating our buy recommendation at a revised target price of rm5.36 per share. this is based on fy15 eps of 23.3 sen, pegged to fy15 per of 23 times. our target per is a slight premium to our large-cap sector per of 20 times. uzma bhdtarget price: rm7.30 outperform kenanga research (april 2): uzma and its partner eq petroleum developments malaysia sdn bhd announced that they have signed a small field risk service contract (sfrsc) with petroliam nasional bhd to carry out the development and production of petroleum from the tanjung baram fields for a period of nine years.  the development phase of the entire sfrsc is expected to cost us$100 million and first oil is anticipated in 2015. eq petroleum developments has a 70% stake whilst uzma has a 30% stake in the venture. assuming a 80:20 equity-to-debt ratio; 6% cost of debt and 15 % internal rate of return, we believe uzmas 30% stake will yield accretive earnings of rm5.2 million in fy15. our new target price is rm7.30 is based on an unchanged targeted fy15 per of 16 times. our per is justifiable given that the stock has successfully moved up the value chain instead of just being a service provider. as its share base is pretty illiquid, the share price gains can be significant. this story first appeared in the edge weekly edition of april 07-13, 2014."}, "684": {"date_posted": "14/4/2014", "title": "#hot stock* karex shares rise 10%, call warrants soar 153%",

market capitalisation of rm1.1 billion.  a major reason for this rise  apart from the groups internal consolidation process which has improved profit margins  is said to be the increased level of institutional shareholdings in the company.  currently, institutional shareholdings in bonia stand at 40%, compared with an estimated 15% to 20% a year ago. for instance, milingtonia ltd has emerged as one of the substantial shareholders of bonia in august 2013, and currently holds a 7.25% stake in the group. milingtonia is said to be linked with creador group, a long-term private equity firm focused on growth-orientated businesses. group finance director chong chin look told the edge financial daily that creador is deemed a strategic investor as it has introduced bonia to the management of several shopping complexes in indonesia, and has also assisted in the market survey of bonias branding in indonesia.  the institutional shareholdings in bonia are also more diverse compared with several years ago, considering that permodalan nasional bhd (pnb) once held a dominant 32.99% stake in the retail group in june 2011. pnb has now ceased to be a shareholder of bonia, having divested

jti at rm7.80", "article": " kuala lumpur: the takeover offer for jt international bhd (jti) by its parent company japan tobacco inc, at rm7.80 per share  a 20% premium to its pre-suspension price of rm6.50  could lure minorities into parting with their stock, said analysts covering the tobacco company known for its mild seven brand. jti announced to bursa malaysia yesterday that it had received a conditional takeover offer from jt international holding bv (jtih), a wholly-owned subsidiary of japan tobacco inc, to acquire the remaining 39.63% stake or 103.6 million shares it does not already own in jti. jtih, which has an issued and paid-up capital of us$1.8 billion (rm5.88 billion), currently holds 157.9 million shares, representing approximately 60.37% of the issued and share capital of jti. in making the offer, it does not intend to maintain the listing status of jti. other major shareholders of jti include the employees provident fund (8.13%) and kumpulan wang persaraan (6.84%). analysts viewed the offer price of rm7.80 per share as attractive, considering jtis thin trading volume and the fact that the company is operating in an already matured industry faced with constant challenges. in the notice of the conditional takeover offer, cimb investment bank, which advises jtih, stated that the offer price of rm7.80 represents more than five times jtis audited and announced unaudited net assets per share of rm1.35and rm1.37 respectively, as at dec 31, 2012 and 2013. the offer price also represents a premium of between 20% and 23.8% to the price and [5-days to 1-year] volume-weighted average market prices of jti shares up to and including march 27. the premium offered provides a good opportunity for shareholders to exit. with a thin trading volume, it is hard for investors to get out, said an analyst with uob kay hian research. based on bloomberg data, jti had an average trading volume of only 41,986 shares per day, for the past 90 days. compared with its total issued share base of 261.5 million, trading had been negligible. it is also worth noting that jti shares have not traded at or above the offer price for the past 15 years. it is a good offer, at a time where the consumption outlook is becoming more challenging in malaysia, and with the tobacco industry volume expected to contract by 15% this year, the analyst noted. the tobacco industry is a very mature industry, how much more can you grow? taking it private is a good thing, said another analyst who tracks the stock. he noted constant challenges such as excise duty hikes, which have resulted in the sharp increases in cigarette prices over the years, and that the growing presence of illicit cigarettes have made the industry tougher. it is also a matter where the parent has spotted value, said the uob analyst, stating that with an offer price of rm7.80, it translates to a price-earnings ratio (per) of about 13x [based on its earnings forecast], which is at a sharp discount to its much bigger rival, british american tobacco malaysia bhd (bat) that is valued at 20x per. but he noted that bat has always commanded a sharper premium to jti, due to its much larger market capitalisation of almost rm17 billion, that is eight to nine times jtis and a dominant market share. jti will appoint an independent adviser in relation to the offer, which it will announce in due course. this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on april 1, 2014."}, "707": {"date_posted": "28/3/2014", "title": "#stock focus* gamudas potential loss of rm920m in water asset

ppb group bhd caused the index to rise. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the index price movements in the next few months following may 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high) and 1,769.80 (low). the indexs daily signals (cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) are mainly positive except its stochastic. as such, the indexs obvious support levels are seen at the 1,769, 1,799 and 1,831 levels, while the resistance areas of 1,833, 1,839 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some very heavy profit taking.  our rebound retracement target of 1,839.26 (62% level) may cap the index in the short to medium term. the index must penetrate this key level with high volumes to be certain of an eventual test of the 1,882.20 high again. its simple moving averages (ma) depict a triple timeframe for its daily, weekly and monthly chart. due to its firmer chart signals, we believe investors may adopt a nibble on dips philosophy for the klci.  due to the uncertain tone of the klci, we are recommending a chart sell on pos malaysia bhd. it fell on strong selling on feb 20 backed by high volumes suggesting an overly pessimistic view of its results for the third quarter ended dec 31, 2013 of financial year 2014 (3qfy14). its 3q pre-tax profit was 19.3% lower at rm33.8 million.  looking at the current reported shareholding changes on bloomberg, we observe that the employees provident fund and aberdeen asset (which hold 11.05% and 9.31% respectively) reduced their stakes this month and this could have led to the huge price decline. a check on bloomberg consensus indicates that five research house have coverage on the stock. only one of them has a buy call on the stock, while the remaining four have a hold call. the stock is currently trading at a historical price-earnings ratio of 18 times and a high price-to-book value of 2.6 times. pos malaysias chart trends on the daily and weekly timeframes are very weak. its share price made an obvious decline since its weekly wave-5 high of rm6.05 last november. since that rm6.05 high, pos malaysia fell to its recent february low of rm4.32. its chart has moved into very strong daily and weekly downtrends to its recent february low of rm4.32. as it broke above its recent key critical support levels of rm5.31 and rm5.23, look to sell pos malaysia on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to medium term downtrends for this stock.  the daily and weekly indicators (such as the cci, dmi, oscillator and macd) are very negative and now depict the obvious indications of pos malaysias eventual decline towards much lower levels.  we expect pos malaysia to remain very weak towards its support levels of rm3.94, rm4.32 and rm4.49. it will attract major selling and liquidation activities at the resistance levels of rm4.71, rm5.23 and rm6.05. its downside targets are now at rm3.57, rm2.24 and rm1.05.lee cheng

cancelled its plans to list its malaysian number forecast operator (nfo) division in singapore.  nonetheless, the stock is still a buy, as its appealing 6.6% to 6.9% annual yield, makes it the most attractive dividend play under our gaming coverage. our discounted cash flow-based fair value, now stands at rm4.46 (from rm5.01), following a revision in our earnings forecasts and weighted average cost of capital assumptions. btoto commands an estimated 41% share of the nfo market, vis-u00e0-vis magnum bhds 35% share. we believe that btotos niche as the only nfo offering lotto games, puts it in a position of strength, compared with other nfos, whose traditional 4d games are facing competition from illegal operators. the companys move to call off its listing, may have been a blessing in disguise, as the proposal would have eventually diluted btotos interest in the nfo, to 28.7% (from 100%), which would then subject btoto to a holding company discount, due to the loss of a directly-owned business. perdana petroleum bhdtarget price: rm2 add cimb research (dec 26): perdana has taken delivery of its 16th vessel, which will be deployed to dayang on a long-term job, wrapping up a year of exceptional turnaround, following several washout years. keep an eye on this company, as it takes on more deliveries in 2014. we continue to value the stock at a 2015 per of 15.8 times, applying a 30% discount to the average per of the oil and gas big caps. the stronger earnings uptick expected in fy14, is the potential re-rating catalyst that supports our add call. we are encouraged that perdanas fleet expansion programme is on track. the operating environment in the marine support space, has been very conducive, with improvement in both charter and utilisation rates. perdana currently fetches a charter rate of around us$2 per horsepower, for a 5,000-horsepower anchor handling tug supply vessel  higher than the us$1.50 to us$1.80, netted in 2012.  meanwhile, the companys utilisation rate shot up to a robust 83% in 3q13, from an estimated 74% in 3q12. malaysia airports holdings bhdtarget price: rm7.63 neutral midf research (dec 24): mahb exercised its right of first refusal to acquire construction conglomerate gmrs 40% stake in the two companies that operate the istanbul sabiha gokcen (isg) airport, and the hotel, retail outlets and lounge services (lgm). gmr is one of mahbs joint-venture partners. the acquisition will be settled via a total cash consideration of u20ac225 million (equivalent to rm1 billion). the successful deal is expected to lift mahbs stake in isg airport, from 20% to 60%, while the remaining 40% shareholding is still held by limak holdings. the ev/ebitda multiple of the isg and lgm transactions, are calculated at 15 times. based on comparable airports acquisition in europe, in the past eight years, the ev/ebitda multiple was transacted in the range of 9 to 35 times, with an average of 19.6 times.  while isg airport is still loss-making, albeit blessed with good traffic growth factor, we view that the transaction is within the mid-range of the ev/ebitda multiple, and fair in terms of valuation.bimb holdings bhdtarget price: rm4.80 buy maybank ib research (dec 23): we are positive on the price that bimb has paid for the remaining 49% stake in bank islam, which translates into a decent september price-to-book value of 1.8 times, for a bank that offers return on equities of 15% to 16%. the deal is eps accretive, by 10% to 11%. fundamentals remain intact and we project a strong two-year eps cagr of 29%, due in part to earnings accretion from the recent corporate move. with the recent weakness in the share price, we take this opportunity to raise our call to a buy. bimbs net profit is upped 53% to 56% for fy14 and fy15, with expectations that bank islam will account for 88% of group pre-tax profit in fy14. eps accretion is projected to be a lower 10% to 11%, due to the dilutive impact of the rights issue, which contributed to a 40% enlargement in share capital.  overall, we are positive on bimbs prospects. we forecast above-industry financing growth of 16% in fy14 (against the industrys 9% to 10%). ijm corp bhdtarget price: rm6.75 buy maybank ib research (dec 24): ijms 38.4% west coast expressway concession has met all conditions and construction can commence, after the government gave its approval on dec 23, 2013. this is positive for ijm, which is eyeing a significant portion of the works available, potentially boosting its outstanding order book to rm6 billion, from rm2.5 billion. we, however, maintain our earnings forecasts for now, pending the actual award of works. ijm remains as our top buy in construction. ijm has a direct 20% stake in west coast expressway sdn bhd (wcesb). together with its stake in kumpulan europlus, ijm has an effective 38.4% stake in wcesb. our estimate is for the concession to enhance ijms valuations by rm100 million, or 7.8 sen per share, assuming 10% project internal rate of return. ijm hopes to win 70% of the rm5 billion wce work packages, translating into rm3.5 billion. this would significantly boost its outstanding order book, which stood at rm2.5 billion as at end-september 2013, after winning rm538 million, year-to-date. gamuda bhdtarget price: rm5.25 outperform kenanga research (dec 24): just a few days after the deadline for the remaining kesas shareholders acceptance (of which only amcorp properties bhd accepted), gamuda has made fresh offers to the kesas shareholders, that had rejected the earlier offer, namely permodalan nasional bhd (pnb, 20% stake) and perbadanan kemajuan negeri selangor (pkns, 30% stake). gamuda increased the offer price by 12% to rm280 million and rm420 million, for pnb and pkns respectively. gamuda is also increasing amcorps offer value to rm280 million. altogether, gamudas offer price for the 70% stake in kesas, is rm980 million (rm1.4 billion for 100% stake). we are of the view that the 12% increase in the offer price, is still fair, judging from the valuation of normalised per of 12 times (average net profit of rm120 million) against its peer, litrak holdings 17 times. it is also still below our valuation for kesas holdings, at rm1.63 billion. we believe that gamudas strong fundamentals have yet to be fully-priced in its share price.  malaysian resources corp bhdtarget price: rm2.06 buy hlib research (dec 24): mrcb has entered into an agreement with arch angel dmc sdn bhd (aadmc), to acquire a 70% stake in arch angel capital sdn bhd (aac) for rm34 million. the offer price consists of: 1) rm2.5 million for shares in aac from aadmc; 2) rm1.5 million for new shares in aac; and 3) rm30 million for redeemable convertible preference shares in aac. aac has entered into a sale and purchase agreement with putrajaya holdings, for a 1.84-acre freehold parcel, known as plot 2c4, precinct 2, putrajaya. the acquisition has yet to be completed. we understand that the proposed development is for a 13-storey commercial building, with a potential gdv of rm300 million to rm400 million. we are positive on the move to diversify from kl sentral, for development profits. however, the deal will only be meaningful, if the development can be monetised quickly. based on 3qfy13 numbers, mrcb has a cash pile of rm473.8 million, and total debt/sukuk of rm3.4 billion. hence, this acquisition has minimal impact on its balance sheet.datasonic group bhdfair value: rm2.58 buy rhb research (dec 23): datasonics share price went ex on dec 23, 2013, following the completion of its 1-to-5 share split. with that, we foresee improvements in its trading liquidity. we believe fy13 earnings could surpass our rm80.8 million full-year estimate, with dividend surprise, likely on the cards. maintain buy with our fair value increased to rm2.58 (from rm2.36), as we ascribe a higher forecast fy14 target per of 18 times. datasonics daily traded volume averaged at 500,000 shares over the last two months, compared with 200,000, prior to our initiation. the completion of the share split exercise will boost its outstanding share base to 675 million (from 135 million).  this, in our view, could entice participation from retail investors and improve trading liquidity, over the near-to-medium term. we believe that its fy13 earnings, due to be released by mid-february 2014 (at the time of writing), could potentially surpass our full-year estimate of rm80.8 million. we gather that improvements in overall profitability, are likely on higher economies of scale, given that both its mykad and passport contracts have gained further traction in 4q13.tenaga nasional bhdtarget price: rm12.29 add cimb research (dec 23): we have gathered that: 1) future tariff reviews after six months, remain very much the governments prerogative; 2) piped gas prices from petronas could be raised again, assuming there is another round of tariff hike, after six months; and 3) tenagas return on assets (roa) is expected to match its weighted average cost of capital (wacc) by 2017.  the clarification with regards to the tariff hike provides investors with more comfort for tenagas outlook, moving forward. the base tariff hike would improve tenagas roa, to match its wacc by 2017, thus implying that it would drive earnings higher, to a certain extent. although fuel costs remain a concern, we believe that they would not leave tenaga worse off, in the longer run. our target price is unchanged at rm12.29, based on 12.6 times fy15 eps, in line with its historical five-year average per. we maintain our add rating. rerating catalysts include improved earnings for fy14 to fy17, arising from the base tariff hike that is expected to increase tenagas roa. mkh bhdfair value: rm3.05 trading buy kenanga research (dec 26): mkh is a fundamentally strong property developer with a solid 19-year track record of profitability since its listing in 1995.we gather that most of mkhs housing projects are located in kajang and they mainly offer affordable units priced below rm600,000 per unit. this should place mkh in a good position as we believe developers with significant exposure to affordable housing should fare better under the current economic scenario. mkhs fy13 core net profit surged 60% y-o-y to rm123 million. this was mainly due to the strong performance from its property development and construction division in which pbt jumped 69% y-o-y to rm143 million. the plantation divisions core pbt also increased to rm24 million (from last years rm5 million). we have excluded the impact of unrealised forex loss and a gain on asset disposal (rm31 million) in the plantation division. our fair value of rm3.05 is based on a 35% discount to our sop rnav of rm4.69, implying 1.02 times price-to-book value on fy14e book value per share of rm3 or 7.1 times fy14e per.bumi armada bhdtarget price: rm4.43 trading buy alliance research (dec 24): bumi armada has formalised its contract with enquest, to supply the kraken floating production, storage and offloading (fpso) vessel. the contract is worth rm4.6 billion and covers the bareboat charter, as well as the operation and maintenance of the fpso vessel, for a fixed period of eight years, with 17 yearly optional extensions. the contract value is within our estimates.  fy14 is looking to be a good year for bumi armada, with a potential for more news flow on another fpso contract in indonesia. we maintain our trading buy recommendation, given that the long-awaited fpso contracts are finally starting to materialise. there could be some upside from fy16 onwards, from the commencement of operational and maintenance (o&m) works. however, values tend to vary for o&m works, as they depend on the work volume, which may be minimal in the early years of an fpso vessels operations. based on our observation of other fpso contracts, o&m work can sometimes not be profitable. we make no changes to our estimates, at this juncture.tambun indah land bhdfair value: rm2.08 buy rhb research (dec 26): tambun indah has entered into an agreement with gems maju sdn bhd, to construct a campus on an eight-acre site, and thereafter, lease it to the latter for 30 years. while the construction of phase 1, will cost tambun indah rm38 million, gems maju will invest another rm32 million for the campus fittings. phase 1 will have a built-up area of 200,000 sq ft, and according to the management, the rental for the first eight years is fixed at 8% of the construction costs, plus 4% of the land value.  from the ninth year onwards, there will be a step up of 2% annually. this translates into about rm3.5 million per annum, or an attractive 7% yield, based on the net market value of rm35 psf, after a rm5 psf discount for the land. we make no changes to our forecast. we continue to hold our positive view on the penang mainland, as more investments are expected to flow in, in 2014, with tambun indah

misunderstood as normal equity stock. \"more investors are also currently shifting into property,\" he told reporters after launching the fund here today. the initial take-up rate for the fund is targeted to be between 20 million-100 million units at rm1.00 per unit, with a minimum subscription size of 1,000 units. mahdzir said the company would launch several advertisements and campaigns in order to raise awareness about the etf among investors. \"islamic etfs are suitable for investors seeking a low cost, passive approach to investing in an equity portfolio which comprises shariah-compliant companies. \"islamic etfs can either be used for long-term investment, as an asset allocation tool, or as a flexible intra-day trading instrument,\" he added. the myetf-mmid is

said that it was time to buy on sept 29, 2011, prestariang was near its all-time low of 49 sen. highlighting its 50% payout policy, he said that dividend yields were at least 10%. the stock rocketed 172%, within 10 months. on jan 8, 2013, when prices were at rm1.16, kong told clients that prestariang should be worth a buck more. those who followed, would have more-than-doubled their money, as the stock gained as much as 152% to rm2.85 apiece, on dec 13. at the time of writing, there was still another 18% upside potential to his rm3.37 price target, with 4.2% potential yield, going by his

special mention, because those that bought prestariang when he initiated coverage with a buy in mid-august 2012, would have seen gains of as much as 149% at its peak. chong has since cut prestariang

overlooked is genting plantations some 6,600 acres of prime landbank, worth rm4 billion, in iskandar and sepang, he said, telling clients that at rm8.50 levels, they were getting the iskandar landbank for free.  raising his recommendation to a buy and price target from rm8 to rm10.30, he said that there was already a 20% discount to the rm13 apiece that he had calculated the assets to be worth.  genting plantations rose as much as 33.6% to rm11.53 apiece on nov 18, 2013, gaining as much as rm2.2 billion in market cap, before the latest round of property cooling measures doused investor

analytica sdn bhds kevin khoo, who was the first to issue an extensive report in september 2005. muhibbah, which started 2006 near 20 sen levels, reached rm3.50 levels by july 2007. by october 2008, however, the stock had fallen to 60 sen levels and largely hovered around the rm1 levels, until early 2013. on march 27, 2013, hwangdbs analysts kevin wong and chong tjen-san, reintroduced the niche marine, and oil and gas contractor  which also makes cranes and ships, as well as takes on civil engineering jobs  to investors.  with an increasingly-crowded civil infrastructure space, we think that this spread of business differentiates muhibbah from the average contractor, they said, when initiating coverage with a rm2.15 target price. at the time, the company  which stood to benefit from a new wave of petronas offshore service vessel contracts  was also among those shortlisted for myanmars mandalay international airport concession. from rm1.18 apiece, muhibbah jumped 130% to reach rm2.72, on july 27, 2013. even at rm2.33 on dec 16, 2013, the stock has appreciated 97%, since coverage was initiated. although this is smaller than its 182% gain year-to-date, it is still a great comeback

the most bullish, among analysts polled on bloomberg. however, hers was the best among submissions received for consideration, when it came to recommendations in the alternative real estate developer space. investors who paid attention when law said butterworth-based tambun indah should be worth as much as 34% more, based on what its assets and landbank were worth, stood to benefit as the stock rose 70%, from 89 sen on april 2, 2013, to as high as rm1.51 on aug 19. she had a price target of rm1.70 at the time of writing, implying just over 20% upside, for the company that she reckons will

analyst low yee huaps calls on uzma bhd uzma bhd may not be a big name among oil and gas counters, but with its stock up over 200% in year 2013, it is one of those counters that with hindsight, many would kick themselves for not buying. part of the gains was spurred by investors gravitation towards the esoteric oil and gas business in 2013. it is due to the quantum of the gains that bimb securities researchs chiong tong chai and hong leong investment banks (hlib) low yee huap, both merit notable mentions. bimb, which started covering uzma in 2011, has the stock as its top pick in year 2013.  hlib too, began covering the company, ahead of its rally in 2013. as the edge best call awards usually go to new calls made during the year, both recommendations would not normally have made the list, as they are not entirely new. the decision to make an exception, took into consideration that some calls will take time to be proved right, and investors who took action should be laughing all the way to the bank. petroliam nasional bhds strategy to enhance oil recovery on existing and new oilfields augurs well for uzma, which is also eyeing risk-sharing contracts (rsc) for marginal oilfield developments.  chiong is now neutral on uzma, with a rm5.05 price target, but foresees the successful bagging of an rsc, bringing the company better fortunes. low, on the other hand, still has a buy call and rm5.20 target price. time will tell, who has the better call. cimb research analyst norziana mohd inon and kaf-seagroatt & campbell securities analyst dharmini thuraisingams calls

leapt from 50 sen in october 2012, to around 85 sen. from there, the stock nearly doubled, in less than four months, to as high as rm1.67 in july 2013. it was still up 122% at its rm1.52 close, on dec 16, 2013. norziana, who started coverage on alam maritim in march 2008, continues to be bullish on the company, due to its ballooning order book and the anticipation of improvements in utilisation and charter rates, amid a significant pick-up in offshore drilling activities. her target price was rm1.90, at the time of writing. another long-time believer of alam maritim is kaf-seagroatt & campbell securities dharmini thuraisingam, who also saw the recovery on charter rates for offshore vessels. in january 2013, she told clients that the earlier spike in share price was just the beginning of a larger structural re-rating of the stock. she has a target price of rm1.80. due to the strong gains seen at alam maritim in 2013, both analysts earn notable mentions for their continued conviction that proved propitious for clients, although their calls have been maintained for years. cimb research analyst nigel foos call on my eg services bhd if my eg services bhds shares ran harder in 2012, cimb researchs nigel foo might have earned the best discovery award in 2012. the delayed response by the market notwithstanding, investors who picked up my eg shares at 73 sen levels, when foo started coverage with a buy on aug 6, 2012, would have more-than-tripled their investments in just 16 months. my egs lowest point in 2013, was 74 sen on feb 6, during which, foo told clients that the shares were worth rm1.34 apiece. those who bought back the shares would have been sitting on 260% of gains, as they touched rm2.67 apiece on nov 27. total returns were still 249%, if measured between the initiation on aug 6, 2012, and dec 16s rm2.54 close. in his initiation note, foo said that my eg could even thrive in recessions, as consumers are encouraged to use its cheaper and more convenient services. it also enjoys some recurring income, he said in a note, on sept 19, 2013, which highlighted potential income stream from the custom service tax monitoring system and road safety diagnostic services, that had not been pencilled into its forecasts. foo has since cut my eg to hold on dec 12, 2013, with there being only 6.1% upside potential to his rm2.78 target price, from its rm2.62 close that day. thats conservative relative to macquarie research, which became the second house to start coverage on my eg, on aug 15, 2013. the latter still says buy, with a rm3 target price. amresearch

rm1.45. the counter hardly moved, but eight months later, soon saw reason to raise his price target, from rm1.80 to rm1.91 apiece, on april 19, 2013. citing information from kkbs 2012 annual report, soon flagged kkb chairman datuk kho kak bengs statement, that the group stands ready to expand further into fabrication, for the oil and gas sector, in the near future, having more-than-tripled its yard capacity, to 50,000 tonnes in 2012.  its prospects have also brightened considerably, since its 43%-owned associate oceanmight sdn bhd secured a three-year petronas approved supplier licence, which allows it to tender for offshore facility fabrication jobs. among the jobs that it has since bagged, include a rm17.1 million fabrication job for petronas proposed lng train 9 project in bintulu, sarawak. incidentally, kkb was also hovering at rm1.45 levels, on april 19, 2013. investors who bought on soons cue, would have seen 96% gains in about six months, as the stock reached as high as rm2.84 on oct 31, 2013  exceeding his target price of rm2.50, at the time. he has since downgraded his recommendation to hold, with a target price of rm2.71  a level the stock hit on dec 16. the price target had worked in a 5% discount to his rm2.85 sum-of-parts valuation of the company, which is 20% owned by cahya mata sarawak bhd. alliance research analyst ian wans call on carlsberg brewery malaysia bhd if alliance researchs ian wan had a crystal ball, he might have chosen to tell clients to buy a little more carlsberg brewery malaysia bhd shares at rm12 levels, given that the stock did appreciate another 42%, to reach a peak of rm17.06 on may 31, 2013. what impressed the judges, that they gave him a coveted spot in 2013, however, was how he rightly told clients to buy the stock, up to about the rm12 levels, and then correctly cut his recommendation to sell, on may 30, 2013  just before carlsberg peaked and began sliding. this was after the brewerys 1qfy2013 results came in below expectations, making up only 23.3% of alliance researchs full-year forecast. when the stock had shed some 29% to reach the rm12 levels again, wan raised his call to neutral on nov 19, 2013, despite the companys 3qfy2013 results, coming in below expectations yet again. he justified that the overall downside is limited, after the share price slid 24%, since his sell call on may 30. we believe, at its current valuation, market has largely priced in the challenging outlook. as such, we upgrade the stock from sell to neutral, he said in the report, while revising the target price to rm11.24, which implies 18.9 times earnings and a 5.3% yield for fy2014. will his call continue to prove prescient? dbs vickers research analyst quah he weis call on dayang enterprise holdings bhd dbs vickers researchs quah he wei, once wrote in his note, that dayang enterprise holdings bhd had [hit] a jackpot! investors who paid attention when he recommended that they buy dayang, as far back as july 2011, when the stock was going for rm1.80 apiece, would have hit a small jackpot of their own, as the stock price rallied in 2013. if measured from a low of rm2.302 in late-february 2013, dayangs shares had increased 147%, as it hit a 52-week high of rm5.69, on dec 13, 2013. on hindsight, the call would have been near perfect, had he only started coverage about a year earlier, when the stock was going for rm1.77. seven out of eight analysts polled on bloomberg, still have a buy on dayang, according to bloomberg data, at the time of writing. quahs rm5.90 target price is the most conservative, being rm1.08 or 15.5% below the most-bullish target price of rm6.98 apiece. at dec 16s rm5.59 close, quahs price target implied only 5.5% upside potential. regardless of whether a downgrade is in store, or if he will turn out to be overly conservative, he has earned a spot for the best recommendation, among the submissions received for consideration. that, in itself, warrants a pat on the back. this story first appeared in the edge weekly edition of dec 23-29, 2013."}, "739": {"date_posted": "19/2/2014", "title": "market close: klci posts 11th-hour gains on high trades of

the klci", "article": " the market whipsawed last week as the fbm klci approached the next resistance level at 1,840 points and was getting technically overbought in the short term. the market is still bullish as the index was able to stay above the previous resistance level at 1,820 points. a slew of positive corporate results helped support the bullish trend. furthermore, malaysias gross domestic product grew 5.1% in the last quarter of 2013, beating market expectations. this provided some boost to market confidence. however, the malaysian economy grew by 4.7% for the whole of 2013, compared with 5.6% in 2012. the klci remained almost firm from last week at 1,825.24 points after trading between 1,813.90 and 1,833.39 points. the close at the middle of the trading range indicates market uncertainty. average daily trading volume for the past one week was higher at 2.9 billion shares, compared with 1.8 billion shares two weeks ago. however, the average trading value was rm2.2 billion indicating that penny stocks were the focus. last week, net sellers in bursa malaysia continued to be foreign institutions at rm760.2 million and another rm40.4 million from local retail. net buyers were local institutions. in the klci, gainers equalled decliners. the gainers were led by misc bhd (+4.4%), tenaga nasional bhd (+3%) and ihh healthcare bhd (+2.7%) while decliners were led by sapurakencana petroleum bhd (-3.1%), cimb group holdings bhd (-1.8%) and ammb holdings bhd (-1.8%). global markets continued to rally higher last week and asian markets continued to increase after a rebound two weeks ago. singapores straits times index rose 1.3% in a week to 3,070.78 points. hong kongs hang seng index increased 2.9% to 22,587.72 points. chinas stock exchange composite index increased only 0.7% to 2,119.07 points. the japanese market rebounded strongly yesterday to close higher. japans nikkei 225 index rose 0.8% in a week to 14,843.24 points. us and european shares continued to increase last week but the markets are expected to be cautious on subdued us economic data that caused the us dollar to slump to a three-week low against the euro. the us dow jones industrial average increased 2.2% in a week to 16,154.39 points last friday. the market was closed on monday for a public holiday. londons ftse100 index increased 2.2% in a week to 6,736.00 points while germans dax index jumped 3.9% to 9,656.6 points. commodity prices were bullish on a weak us dollar as investors are now hedging against the greenback and equity markets uncertainty. commodity exchange gold rose 2.3% in a week to us$1,320.30 (rm4,343) an ounce. new york mercantile exchange crude oil closed marginally higher in a week at us$100.34 per barrel. the us dollar index declined to 80.24 points from 80.73 points in the previous week, the lowest level in slightly more than a month. the ringgit slightly strengthened against the us dollar from 3.33 to 3.30. crude palm oil futures rallied on a bullish trend, increasing 3.9% in a week to rm2,714 per tonne. the klci is in a bullish mode after climbing above the short term 30-day moving average last week and managed to stay above this level despite the whipsaw in the past week. it is still early to say whether the klci correction is over and the bullish trend may continue. the index has so far retraced 50% from the downward correction since early january. the 61% fibonacci retracement level is at 1,839 points and the klci may still remain bearish if it stays under this level. furthermore, the klci is still below the ichimoku cloud which currently ranges between 1,830 and 1,850 points. momentum indicators like the rsi continued to increase after climbing above its middle level last week and this signals that the momentum has turned bullish. the macd has also crossed above its trigger line or nine-day moving average early last week. the index has climbed above the mid-band of the bollinger bands but not near the top band of this indicator. this indicates that the bullish momentum is still weak. we are probably going to see a cautious market this week and although the klci momentum is bullish, it may struggle to climb higher. higher commodity prices show that the market has shifted its focus from the equity markets. locally, foreign institutions have been net sellers for a few months now and there are no indications of slowing down. this would also dampen market confidence. henceforth, i am expecting the klci to trade sideways between 1,808 and 1,835 points. benny lee is chief market strategist

indonesian, malaysian and philippine equities by at least 1.8 percentage points. stocks sank as data showed home purchases tumbled last year to a four-year low and retail sales dropped, while manufacturing growth weakened in china, singapores biggest export market. the singapore selloff is due in large part to the sputtering domestic economy, said david ross, maryland, washington-based managing director of chevy chase trust co., which oversees about $15 billion. the weakening consumer economy portends weakness in the property segment that could send ripples through the financial system. while not the most likely scenario, the odds of a bursting property bubble are increasing. singapore shares posted the third-biggest decline among developed markets this year after as much as $3 trillion was wiped from equities worldwide on concern the global economic recovery is faltering. the citys regulators said feb. 7 they may introduce a minimum price for stocks and impose collaterals and other restrictions for trades after a slump in the shares of three commodity companies erased $6.9 billion in market value over three days in october. singapore companies will struggle

a library. prime minister lee hsien loong is pushing companies to produce more with fewer employees as the island confronts an aging population and voter discontent about foreign workers. policies ranging from higher levies for overseas labor to tighter limits on non-singaporeans in some industries, have boosted costs for companies including sia engineering co., which said higher wages helped

the market is drifting lower as there are no visible catalysts. cost pressures, particularly on wages, for singapore companies is quite high and thats going to eat into their profits. shares on the

salem and camel cigarettes in malaysia, has warned of a tough year ahead, given an expected further decline in sales volume and higher marketing expenses amid inflationary pressures. jti managing director rob stanworth said following the latest excise duty hike of 14% in october last year which saw tobacco companies raising cigarette prices by rm1.50 per pack of 20 sticks, the tobacco industry saw a more than 10% drop in sales volume in the fourth quarter of last year and this is likely to drop even further this year. i think we will see further contractions this year (as more smokers switch to buying illicit cigarettes which cost about half the price of legal ones). these events (increases in tobacco taxes) rarely moderate quickly, stanworth told the edge financial daily in an interview. research houses are forecasting total cigarette industry volume to decline by between 10% and 15% year-on-year in 2014. despite the challenging operating environment, stanworth said the group seeks to generate the same profit margin as it has over the years. for the nine months ended sept 30, 2013 (9mfy13) and 9mfy12, its pre-tax profit margin stood at 13.4% and 13.1% respectively, while net margin stood at about 10%. in the third quarter ended sept 30, 2013 (3qfy13), jti reported a 7.7% decline in sales volume, causing its revenue to dip to rm307.3 million from rm319.2 million in the year-ago quarter. however, this was offset partially by higher cigarette prices in the quarter. stanworth said the group can only conclude that the vast majority of consumers had simply moved to illegal cigarettes, which accounted for some 35% of the market. according to the asia-11: illicit tobacco indicator 2012 study by oxford economics, malaysia has the third highest level of illicit tobacco use, after brunei and hong kong.as such, our outlook for jti and the overall industry depends very much on the [legal] market size rather than just the economic situation as malaysia still has a stubbornly high illicit trade issue, said stanworth. sales down... jti managing director rob stanworth says the tobacco industry saw a more than 10% drop in sales volume in the fourth quarter of last inflationary pressures have also led consumers to cut back on their spending, stanworth said. he remains cautiously optimistic for sustained financial performance for the financial year ending dec 31, 2014 (fy14). he explained that while the group is optimistic about its efforts to offer consumers more for their money with new product launches, it remains cautious as the size of the market and its development are not within its control. on its part, jti will be intensifying its marketing efforts this year to maintain its competitiveness. investing more in the product itself and marketing are two ways that we can try to win (market share) regardless of the prevailing economic and market environment, stanworth said. jti recently launched mevius airstream, the first slide cigarette pack in the country, which includes a special filter that delivers smoke in a different way, thereby creating a different smoking experience. this launch is a clear example that we believe in investing in the product itself, thereby giving consumers something new and something more, and it is one of the key ways we can outperform in the market, stanworth said. he said response to the new product has been excellent so far, adding that jti may export the new format to other asian markets in the future. the slide packs are currently manufactured at jtis plant in shah alam, selangor. there will always be something (new for consumers). we are always looking to do the most that we can for them, stanworth said, when asked if there will be other new product launches this year. mevius, salem and camel fall under jtis premium brands, while winston falls under the value for money (vfm) segment. however, stanworth preferred to refer its vfm segment as a sub-premium segment for the quality winston possesses and that it sells for only rm1.50 below the price of mainstream premium brands. unfortunately, consumers view illicit cigarettes as real vfm [at a price per pack of about rm3.50], he said. while acknowledging that comprehensive regulations are already in place, stanworth said new regulations imposed by the malaysian government need to be fact based, and not emotionally or ideologically driven to prevent unintended consequences like driving the illegal market. ultimately, the government can implement any legislation it sees fit and the legitimate cigarette industry will comply. however, the government must also be mindful that it also has to live with the consequences as well, be that in lost tax revenues or undermining their own health agenda, he said. for 9mfy13, jti posted higher net profit of rm101.5 million from rm98.3 million a year ago, despite a marginal decrease in revenue to rm942.4 million from rm944 million due to a 4.4% decline in sales volume.on its 4qfy13 performance, stanworth said it has met management expectations but declined to elaborate as results will be released by the end of this month. year-to-date, jti stock rose 7.35% to close at rm6.50 last friday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm1.7 billion. trading down by consumers to impact vfm segment morekuala lumpur: although consumers do trade down from the premium cigarettes segment to value for money (vfm) brands with each cigarette price increase, sales volume in the premium segment has been growing while that in the vfm segment has declined, said jt international bhd (jti) managing director rob stanworth. smokers will reach a point where the absolutely high price causes them to leave the legal cigarette market completely or look for alternatives within the total offering available such as going straight from premium cigarettes to illegal ones, he told the edge financial daily. however, stanworth said with jti having more than 50% share of the sub-premium segment with its winston brand, it is in a good position to capture consumers who trade down within the legitimate market. to what extent would any downgrade from premium cigarettes stop at the sub-premium level? only time would tell, he said. the reason why jti does not have plans to penetrate the e-cigarette market at the moment, as stanworth cited, is due to the availability of very cheap illegal cigarettes, thus making the rate of penetration of e-cigarettes relatively low in malaysia. in its malaysia strategy report for the first half of the year, uob kay hian research is of the view that jti stands to benefit from recent multiple cigarette price hikes as well as potential trading down by consumers to the vfm segment. it has a buy call on the stock at rm6.60, with a target price of rm7.70. the research firm said with a sizeable net cash pile of rm174 million or 67 sen per share, there is upside to dividends as jti is currently only paying out half of its profits. meanwhile, cimb research expects the vfm volume to see a bigger plunge as a result of the recent sharp price increase of rm1.50 per pack, given its more price-sensitive consumers. it sees the volume reduction in the premium segment, which accounts for more than 70% of british american tobacco (m) bhds revenue, to be milder as smokers in this segment tend to be less price sensitive. cimb research also highlighted that under the current tough operating environment, product innovation is of utmost importance, acknowledging that jti is upgrading machines to improve the packaging of its products. cimb has a reduce call on jti, with a target price of rm5.30.  by wei lynn tang this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on february 10, 2014."}, "755": {"date_posted": "7/2/2014",

investor confidence in the stock. is the selldown in the groups shares in recent days justified? at rm6.90, cimb group is trading at about 12 times price-earnings ratio based on the forecast earnings for 2013 and a price-to-book value of about 1.7 times. when compared with key industry players such as malayan banking bhd and public bank bhd, cimb groups valuations are not expensive. if investors are selling because they are worried that cimb groups balance sheet has been impaired by cimb niaga, the concern may be a tad overdone. the banking group has been posting strong earnings growth in recent years. moving forward, analysts generally expect this uptrend to continue, although the growth momentum this year and the next may not be as strong as before. in fact, the overall banking industry is unlikely to chart the robust growth rates that it did in the last few years. based on net earnings of rm3.502 billion recorded during the first nine months of 2013, cimb group looks set to

to fall 4% during the period. indonesia contributes some 30% to cimb groups earnings, compared with about 10% for maybank, the other banking group with a huge presence there. while indonesia has turned more challenging, the outlook isnt all doom and gloom as the government there is already taking steps to address the problems. a financial crisis is unlikely, barring black swan events. what will happen is that loans growth will come down from the 30% growth levels to the mid-teens, and asset quality may face some erosion as interest rates rise.  thus, the fund-raising exercise is a pre-emptive move by cimb group to cushion itself against a further weakening in the rupiah, which could prevent it from achieving its internal target of 9.5% to 10% for common equity tier 1 (cet-1) by 2015. we believe this is a wise move given that a further fall in the rupiah could erode the groups cet-1 capital to below 8% without the additional rm3.55 billion raised. if the rupiah falls further and cimb group fails to meet its internal cet-1 target, the market could become more nervous.  the rm3.55 billion helped boost its cet-1 to 9.7% from the current 8.2%, in line with the industry

exploration and production (e&p) sector. the improvement in the overall 9m13 gross margins (31.2%, from 29.3% in 9m12), came from the addition of mid-high-tier vessels with higher margins.  eleven such units were added as at sept 30, 2013, while we had only expected eight for the whole year. mid-higher-tier vessels, now account for 60% of its fleet, while utilisation remains at 75%. gross margins for owned vessels, jumped to 51% in 9m13 (9m12: 46.4%). the strict implementation of the cabotage rule, restricted supply and supported an increase in day rates. a stronger us dollar also helped to widen margins, as wages and costs are in rupiah. with an uptick in e&p, 9m13 chartered vessel revenue surged 82% y-o-y. margins also improved to 6.2% (9m12: 5.4%). with the strict

consumer sentiments over the next one to two years, with adjustments in spending patterns. the introduction of gst in april 2015, will bring forth another wave of fluctuations in spending, as customers frontload their purchases prior to the increase, turning around the decline in sales in fy14.  subsequently, a dip in sales would likely occur. meanwhile, the indonesian market boasts strong consumer demand, with rising affluence in the growing middle class. we estimate the first two stores to contribute about 4% and 5.9% to the top line, in fy15f and fy16f respectively, assuming its operations are similar to its malaysian counterpart.  the first megastore, which begins operations in 2014, will offer the full range of products to the bekasi population of 2.4 million residents. we

that in 2q13.  therefore, actual revenue generated from electricity, only reached vnd45 billion in 3q13  similar to that in 2q13, and declining 21% y-o-y.  the rest was revenue from environment protection tax (vnd20/kwh) for 2011 and 2012. although vsh has yet to sign a power purchase agreement for 2010-2013, we believe that it will conclude the contract, before auditing 2013 financial reports. we apply the desired selling price of vnd562/kwh to 2013 earnings. in that case, revenue and pbt are expected to reach vnd400 billion and vnd324 billion. in 2014, we believe output will achieve the normal level of 850 million kwh. revenue and net profit are expected to reach vnd483 billion and vnd339 billion, increasing 21% and 14% y-o-y, respectively. profit margin is expected to

international research (dec 3): anhui conch shares rallied 12% in november 2013, as cement prices gained strength in eastern and south central china  as anticipated.  while its sales volume was as solid as expected, cement prices exceeded its expectation. in october 2013, the average selling price (asp) of cement was up rmb30 per tonne, m-o-m. in november 2013, there was another rmb30 per tonne hike, in the eastern region. the strong prices bode well for 4q earnings, which accounted for 38% of full-year earnings in 2012. according to digital cement, the asp of cement in the southern part of jiangsu rose between rmb20 and rmb30 per tonne (to rmb400 and rmb410 per tonne) during the week of dec 2-8, 2013. because of energy-saving and pollution-reduction measures, some producers had to suspend production, thus causing a shortage in supply and a temporary increase in prices. anhui conch is trading at 15.4 times 2013 per, or 13.5 times 2014 per. we roll over our eps estimate to 2014 (rmb1.85) and apply the same target multiple of 15 times  which is the companys five-year average historical per.  we arrive at a new target price of hk$34 (previous: hk$30.70) and maintain an

annual earnings. the acquisition boosts our dcf target price by thb2.50 per share. pttep and pertamina have jointly signed a 50:50 share purchase agreement to buy hess assets in indonesia  a 75% stake in the pangkah field, and 23% in the natuna sea a field. the latter transaction should be closed by year-end (2013), and the former by 1q14.  as natuna sea a transaction is expected to be finalised soon, pttep will be able to book reserves from the field by year-end (and for pangkah, in 2014).  as both projects are producing assets, the firms petroleum sales will increase by 9,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day (fy14 output will be boosted 3%), so profit is anticipated to expand by thb1.6 billion per year (a 2.3% boost to fy14 npat). pttep said that the total transaction price for the

high-margin product in order to satisfy european demand and offset the recent hike in energy prices.  the big four glove makers  hartalega holdings bhd, top glove corp bhd, kossan rubber industries bhd and supermax corp bhd  are moving towards realigning their product mix, putting emphasis on nitrile glove production over that of natural rubber (nr) and vinyl gloves. top glove and hartalega are the leading players in the nitrile segment. hartalega is the worlds largest nitrile glove producer with a production capacity of 14 billion pieces per annum while top glove currently produces 10 billion pieces. all four firms plan to increase their nitrile production capacity by at least 22% by the end of this year. in a pre-emptive move, kossan is already gearing up to become the worlds biggest nitrile producer by end-2015, overtaking both hartalega and top glove in the process. the firm plans to ramp up its capacity by 59% this year to 13.5 billion pieces, from 8.5 billion presently.  as part of its aggressive expansion plan, kossan recently acquired land in klang to house its new manufacturing plant, which is expected to add another five billion pieces per annum in capacity.  we hope to have a product mix ratio of 70:30 between nitrile and nr products by the end of this year. there are three new plants in the pipeline, with the first one expected to be operational very soon, says edward yip, kossans general manager of corporate affairs and business development, at the spotlight on malaysia 2014 forum organised by bursa malaysia last week. nitriles appeal comes from its position as a premium product over nr gloves. synthetic rubber products have become the preferred choice by consumers due to the increasing prevalence of latex allergies, which may occur with prolonged contact to nr gloves. hartalega is the clear leader in this segment because of its consistently high utilisation rates and its preference for nitrile production, which contributed 92% of total sales during the first half of its financial year ending march 31, 2014 (1hfy14). alongside kossan, supermax is looking to replicate this strategy with a planned expansion of its nitrile capacity by 128% this year, according to data compiled by maybank ib research. while top glove plans to increase its own nitrile capacity by 22%, the company is currently encumbered by the margin squeeze in its nr gloves segment due to higher latex prices and low average selling price. also, it is still seeing operating losses at its manufacturing plants in china.  the rising production of nitrile gloves is an ongoing trend as the product offers higher margins due to its higher selling price. however, with an additional 13 billion pieces expected to hit the market this year, one wonders if it would contribute to an oversupply in the market. in a jan 16 note, maybank ib research says demand will likely come from europe, where nitrile gloves command a 50% market share, compared with 80% in the us. global demand is also expected to pick up by 15%-20% this year. over the longer term, the demand for nitrile remains favourable with room for growth. capacity expansion in 2014 is expected to be led by kossan and supermax, which have already put in the infrastructure and secured the gas supply for their production lines, it says. kossans yip points out that in spite of the recent hike in electricity and gas tariffs, the group remains confident of maintaining its profit margins with its nitrile growth expansion plan. we had already anticipated and prepared for this [energy hikes]. labour costs also increased by 44% following the minimum wage implementation in july last year, but our margins kept increasing anyway, he says. to deal with escalating energy prices, glove makers have raised their asp by 1% to pass through the higher electricity costs beginning this month.  however, cheaper raw materials, which make up nearly half of the production costs, could ensure that margins remain stable in spite of the energy cost inflation. it is worth noting that latex prices have fallen to a four-year low of rm4.84 per kg due to expectation of rising supply. the main beneficiary of this would be top glove as it is the largest nr glove producer, says maybank ib research. analysts say that the persisting nitrile theme may continue to boost the stock prices of the big four firms. cimb research has an outperform call on both kossan and supermax, while maybank ib research has a buy call on kossan and top glove. in terms of share price performance, top glove has lagged its peers after recording only a 0.65% gain between jan 2 and dec 31 last year. during the same period, kossans shares gained 161%, followed by hartalega (54%) and supermax (46%). a useful metric for comparing the production efficiency among the big four glove makers is the gross earnings generated per thousand gloves produced. in the third quarter of last year (3qcy13), hartalega registered gross earnings of rm28.90 per thousand gloves, followed by kossan (rm12.50), supermax (rm10) and top glove (rm7.70). according to a jan 7 note by alliance research, the glove makers will be

weaker ringgit against the usd, and (3) healthy competition which could foster a stronger glove manufacturing industry in malaysia, it says.  while there will be stiff competition among the glove players in the nitrile segment, it is also important to note that having the highest production capacity alone does not necessarily guarantee higher margins.  the firms will have to focus on

initial public offering (ipo) issue price of rm2.80 per share, which implied a total capitalisation of rm6.05 billion. according to umw-og president rohaizad darus, the incoming deliveries of new jack-up (ju) drilling rigs will boost the groups earnings substantially over the next two years. drilling services contributed 94% to its total revenue for the first nine months of last year (9m2013). its simple mathematics. our four operational rigs currently generate a certain amount of revenue. if we add another one, our bottom line will increase by 25%, he says during a media briefing last thursday. rohaizad was referring to naga 5, the groups latest premium ju rig, which is scheduled for delivery in may. umw-og has already secured a us$7 million contract from nido petroleum philippines pty ltd for the provision of drilling services by the new rig. apart from its ju fleet, the group is also the sole malaysian operator of hydraulic workover units (hwus), with four currently being deployed in three countries on short- and long-term tenures. coupled with a rm1 billion war chest from its ipo proceeds after deducting last years expenses, rohaizad is confident that the group can leverage on its working relationship with petroliam nasional bhd and other oil majors to secure new contracts for its ju rigs and hwus. we believe we are able to finance a significant number of new rigs and also secure new contracts due to the increasing regional demand. despite its recent share price gains, there are contrasting valuations on the company by research houses. according to bloomberg data, the consensus analyst view is mostly bearish with 9 out of 13 research houses issuing a neutral or sell rating on umw-og. the most bullish are maybank ib research and cimb research, which set a target price of rm4.80 and rm4.63 respectively. at the other end of the spectrum is goldman sachs research, which set a fair value of a mere rm2.70 on the oil and gas operator. in a jan 20 note, maybank ib argues that the delivery of another two ju rigs  naga 6 and naga 7  by 2015 warrants a premium valuation on the stock. at rm4.80 per share, the research firm has pegged umw-ogs shares at 23 times projected earnings for fy2015. in its calculations, maybank ib projected that umw-ogs core net profit and core earnings per share will triple within two years after taking into account the additional revenue boost from the three upcoming ju rigs. the market now demands new, premium jus, favoured for their superior security, cost and operating features. more importantly, umw-og has the balance sheet strength to expand its ju fleet size beyond the projected five units, it says. however, it is worth noting that new contracts are the lifeblood of oil and gas companies. umw-ogs contract backlog stands at rm1.45 billion, a small figure compared with the order books of other big caps such as sapurakencana petroleum bhd (rm28 billion) and bumi armada bhd (rm10.8 billion), says alliance research, which has a sell call on the stock, pegging the fair value at rm3.16. the research outfit says umw-ogs valuation has exceeded its peers, whose shares are currently trading at lower price-earnings multiples. while the growth outlook for umw-og is promising, especially if the group adds on new rigs, we view that valuations have run too far ahead of peers at this juncture, it says. at the moment, a huge chunk of umw-ogs revenue comes from contracts awarded by petronas carigali sdn bhd (pcsb), with three out of four rigs deployed for the upstream players needs. apart from pcsb, umw-ogs client base for the ju rigs consists of hess, japan vietnam petroleum co and nido petroleum. underlining its regional expansion plans, rohaizad says the group is working towards achieving a 50-50 revenue contribution from domestic and overseas operations respectively. for 9m2013, 66% of its revenue came from malaysia. naga 3 will be moved to vietnam while naga 5 will be operating in the philippines, where we have never been to before. we also have a presence in china, thailand, indonesia and turkmenistan in various capacities. the bullish outlook is mainly supported by the upcoming expiration of a whopping 41 ju rig contracts in southeast asia this year. in malaysia, there are currently 18 jus, of which 16 are foreign owned. in line with the growing demand, daily charter rates for jus have accordingly risen over the past four years. according to maybank ib, average day rates are now holding steadily at us$150,000 and should rise to between us$160,000 and us$170,000 levels due to the favourable oil price environment as well as a mismatch between demand and supply. however, it is apparent that the group will have to aggressively expand its operations and secure new contracts on a consistent basis, either one of which is no small task. the drilling services industry also remains highly competitive, and there is no shortage of international oil and gas operators bidding for the same projects that umw-og is gunning for. umw-og will be spending its cash pile on two new rigs  naga 6 and naga 7. will petronas, which is the companys major client, also deploy the

company by research houses. according to bloomberg data, the consensus analyst view is mostly bearish with 9 out of 13 research houses issuing a neutral or sell rating on umw-og. the most bullish are maybank ib research and cimb research, which set a target price of rm4.80 and rm4.63 respectively. at the other end of the spectrum is goldman sachs research, which set a fair value of a mere rm2.70 on the oil and gas operator. in a jan 20 note, maybank ib argues that the delivery of another two ju rigs  naga 6 and naga 7  by 2015 warrants a premium valuation on the stock. at rm4.80 per share, the research firm has pegged umw-ogs shares at 23 times projected earnings for fy2015. in its calculations, maybank ib projected that umw-ogs core net profit and core earnings per share will triple within two years after taking into account the additional revenue boost from the three upcoming ju rigs. the market now demands new, premium jus, favoured for their superior security, cost and operating features. more importantly, umw-og has the balance sheet strength to expand its ju fleet size beyond the projected five units, it says. however, it is worth noting that new contracts are the lifeblood of oil and gas companies. umw-ogs contract backlog stands at rm1.45 billion, a small figure compared with the order books of other big caps such as sapurakencana petroleum bhd (rm28 billion) and bumi armada bhd (rm10.8 billion), says alliance research, which has a sell call on the stock, pegging the fair value at rm3.16. the research outfit says umw-ogs valuation has exceeded its peers, whose shares are currently trading at lower price-earnings multiples. while the growth outlook for umw-og is promising, especially if the group adds on new rigs, we view that valuations have run too far ahead of peers at this juncture, it says. at the moment, a huge chunk of umw-ogs revenue comes from contracts awarded by petronas carigali sdn bhd (pcsb), with three out of four rigs deployed for the upstream players needs. apart from pcsb, umw-ogs client base for the ju rigs consists of hess, japan vietnam petroleum co and nido petroleum. underlining its regional expansion plans, rohaizad says the group is working towards achieving a 50-50 revenue contribution from domestic and overseas operations respectively. for 9m2013, 66% of its revenue came from malaysia. naga 3 will be moved to vietnam while naga 5 will be operating in the philippines, where we have never been to before. we also have a presence in china, thailand, indonesia and turkmenistan in various capacities. the bullish outlook is mainly supported by the upcoming expiration of a whopping 41 ju rig contracts in southeast asia this year. in malaysia, there are currently 18 jus, of which 16 are foreign owned. in line with the growing demand, daily charter rates for jus have accordingly risen over the past four years. according to maybank ib, average day rates are now holding steadily at us$150,000 and should rise to between us$160,000 and us$170,000 levels due to the favourable oil price environment as well as a mismatch between demand and supply. however, it is apparent that the group will have to aggressively expand its operations and secure new contracts on a consistent basis, either one of which is no small task. the drilling services industry also remains highly competitive, and there is no shortage of international oil and gas operators bidding for the same projects that umw-og is gunning for. umw-og will be spending its cash pile on two new rigs  naga 6 and naga 7. will petronas, which is the companys major client, also deploy the new jack-up rigs? that will determine whether the bullishness on the stock is justifiable. this story first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly edition,

months. the market continued to be bearish last week as markets globally pulled back sharply. the index failed to rebound last week and the index broke below the support level at 1,800 points. the index even closed below the november 2013 support level at 1,780 points on monday to 1,778,88 points, the lowest level in three months. a weakening ringgit caused capital outflows. the malaysian currency was not the only one weakening, emerging asian markets faced the same consequences. foreign institutions were net sellers on bursa malaysia every week for the past month. the klci has declined for the 4th consecutive week since its historical high at the end of last year. the index has declined 4.5% year-to-date. the fbm klci fell 34.1 points or 1.9% in a week to 1,781.25 points yesterday after trading in a range between 1,777.62 and 1,816.57 points. the index once again closed near the low of the trading range and this indicates a very bearish market. trading volume declined to a daily average of 1.6 billion shares in the past week compared with two billion shares two weeks ago. only three out of 30 counters on the klci were up since last week. the gainers were misc bhd (2.1%), hong leong bank bhd (0.4%) and petronas dagangan bhd (0.4%). the decliners were led by sapurakencana petroleum bhd (5.7%), genting malaysia bhd (4.3%) and cimb group holdings bhd (3.8%) global

over china data. the dow jones industrial average declined 3.7% in a week to 15,837.88 points on monday. the steep decline in the us market last friday put pressure on european markets. londons ftse100 index declined 4.2% to 6,550.66 points while germans dax index declined 3.8% to 9,349.22 points.  commodities prices rebounded last week as the us dollar pulled back from its uptrend. the us dollar index fell from 81.28 points a week ago to 80.61 points. the ringgit weakened further from rm3.32 per us dollar to rm3.34. west texas intermediate crude oil futures rose 1.7% in week to us$95.63 per barrel after pulling back from us$97.35 last thursday. commodity exchange gold futures increased only 0.2% in a week to us$1,256.40 an ounce. the weakened ringgit and rising crude oil

past week compared with the previous week, indicating a stronger short-term bearish momentum. the index fell below the uptrend support line at 1,800 points and rebounded from the november 2013 support level yesterday. the rebound, however, was weak. the trend is bearish in the short term as it continued to stay below the short-term 30-day moving average. the worrying indication is that the index has slightly fallen below the ichimoku cloud, which indicates a possible trend reversal. momentum indicators like the rsi, macd and momentum oscillator are indicating strong bearish momentum but near oversold levels in the short term. i mentioned in my previous article three weeks ago that the index may only find a support level at 1,780 to 1,790 points. now that the index is at this level, we may expect prices to consolidate or rebound. the strong bearish momentum may cause a rebound to be difficult as it represents a bearish sentiment. henceforth, we may expect prices to consolidate at this level this week as the market is expected to be quieter in the next two weeks due to the lunar new year festival and holiday. it may be a bearish start for the new year but there may be opportunities in this current downtrend as it is a correction of the long-term uptrend. therefore, it is good to keep an eye on any strong indications of a reversal to confirm that the market is being supported and ready to continue the uptrend. until then, i think it is better to stay out of the market and have a good short week in ushering in the year of the horse. heres wishing everyone gong xi fa cai and

lacklustre trading. ibm, amd and coach posted lower revenue numbers. the sp500 index inched up 1.06 points to close at 1,844.86 points while the dow jones industrial average fell 41.10 points to end at 16,373.34. in malaysia, the fbm klci traded in a downward range of 15.63 points for the week with volumes of 1.52 billion to 1.84 billion done. the index closed at 1,808.31 yesterday, down 5.79 points from wednesday as blue-chip stocks such as british american tobacco (m) bhd, cimb group holdings bhd, felda global ventures holdings bhd, ppb group bhd and rhb capital bhd caused the index to decline on foreign selling yesterday. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed.  the price movements in the index in the months following may 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low) and 1,882.20 (high). the indexs daily signals are mainly negative. the cci, dmi, oscillator and macd are negative while the stochastic is positive. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at 1,759, 1,780 and 1,801 points, while the resistance areas of 1,808, 1,838 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some heavy profit-taking activities.  our downside targets of 1,795, 1,760 and 1,730 for the index in the short term have now emerged out of the bearish price moves since dec 31, 2013. its simple moving averages (ma) depict a mixed tone for its chart time frames. its daily chart has turned negative, while the weekly chart is neutral but the monthly chart appears buoyant for now.  due to its mixed chart signals, we believe investors may adopt a take profit philosophy as the klci remains at fairly lofty levels with bearish divergent signals. as such, profit-taking on index components as well as small to mid caps will persist into the next fortnight before and after the chinese new year holidays. concerns over the local higher bond yields (especially on the 10-year bonds), a consistent weaker tone for regional currencies against the us dollar and persistent foreign fund equity selling may keep the index and local markets under further pressure for a potential decline. due to the lofty tone of the klci, we are recommending a chart sell on kpj healthcare bhd, which is a rm3.4 billion market cap company with a return on equity of 10.3% based on its 12-month trailing earnings. it seems that the recent weakening of the ringgit and the downward klci movement are causing investors to shift towards a more defensive position towards more cash.  despite kpj being a healthcare bellwether, it was not spared. the steady decline in its stock price could be attributed to weaker profitability and losses at the groups three newly opened hospitals, namely kpj bandar baru klang, kpj pasir gudang and pt khasanah putera jakarta medica. maybank ib does not have fundamental coverage on kpj. a check on bloomberg consensus reveals 13 brokers have coverage on the stock, with two brokers having a buy call on the stock, six sell calls and five hold. the stock is currently trading at a lofty historical price-earnings ratio of 30 times and a price-to-book value of 3.3 times. kpjs indicated dividend yield is at a low 1.86%. kpjs chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames are weak indeed. its share price made an obvious plunge since its monthly wave-2 high of rm4.14 in december 2013. since that high, kpj declined to its recent january 2014 low of rm3.30.  its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly downtrends to its recent low of rm3.30. as it broke above its recent key critical supports of rm4.23 and rm4.02, look to sell kpj on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term downtrends for this stock.  the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci and macd) are negative and now depict the obvious indications of kpjs eventual decline to much lower levels.  we expect kpj to remain weak towards its support levels of rm3.04, rm3.11 and rm3.30. it will attract major liquidation activities at the resistance levels of rm3.52, rm4.02 and rm4.23. its downside targets are now located at rm2.89, rm2.13 and rm2.00.lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed in the article are the opinions of the writer and should not be construed as investment advice. please

retaining our target per of 30 times fy14f earnings. both market statistics and our channel checks indicate diverging sales performance across different product categories. the instant noodle industry saw lacklustre sales continue on weak demand, due to the discretionary nature of the product.  on the other hand, chinese traditional fusion juice drinks continue to grow in popularity, against traditional diluted juice drinks.  there was also a sharp slowdown in the sales of hot items in recent years, such as milk tea, crystal sugar clear pear juice and spicy pickled beef-flavoured noodles. demand for bottled water continued to be strong. we believe tingyis more aggressive product innovation since 2h12, and its growing product diversity, should strengthen its competitiveness ahead. the groups pepsi unit also saw improved profitability on enhanced business scale and supply chain integration. new products have been introduced to balance the seasonality in the sales of carbonated

guided that the deal includes a 3.5% yearly step up in rental rates, that has been built into leightons lease.  on top of that, the weighted average lease expiry is 10 years, for 76% of the buildings total net lettable area (nla). leighton intends to sublet the remaining 24% nla, with suntec collecting the market rent attained, or pay a guaranteed net property income of a$724 per sq m per year, with an annual escalation of 3.5% in rental rate  whichever is higher.  payment for construction will also be progressive over a two-year period, and the s$500 million loan is only at 3% interest all-in. the purchase price and recurring rental income will be fully-hedged against currency fluctuations. we believe the progressive payment for the acquisition, will keep suntec reits gearing at a comfortable level of below 40%. the divestment of park mall, if the right offer comes along, is an option for suntec reit to lower gearing.  although the high average translated net property income (npi) of a$724 per sq m per year (versus downtown sydneys a$520 per sq m per year) remains a concern, even if rental drops to the current market rate, the buildings yield remains at an attractive 6.4%. pt indo tambangraya megah tbktarget price: idr27,050 neutral rhb research (nov 18): itms 9mfy13 production and revenue were in line, while profit came in at 71% of our fy13f estimate, due to the omission of a non-operating expense. third-quarter production rose 9% y-o-y (+4% q-o-q) and gross margin grew 510bps q-o-q, aided by lower strip ratios  the volume of waste material needed to be handled, to extract coal. itm reported lower strip ratios in 3qfy13 at its indominco and bharinto mines, which are due to start operations in new pit areas. the company is guiding to maintain similar strip ratios in 4qfy13. we estimate that the strip ratios will rise, as coal production in the new pit areas increase.  nevertheless, our revised strip ratios are lower than earlier estimates. we lower our fy13-15 strip ratios by 2% to 6%, resulting in a 2% to 3% drop in total cash costs. despite lower cash costs, we reduce our fy14-15 profit estimates by 7-11%, to account for the inclusion of new non-operating expenses and higher selling expenses, which will be needed, as itm expands its export destinations to india, the philippines and vietnam. itms strong cash flow generation is evident from its ability to maintain us$300 million in annual net cash in fy14-15, despite total capex of us$264 million and a 75% dividend payout, which translates into a sector-leading yield of 6.2-7%, over fy14-15. ecs holdings ltdfair value: s$0.585 buy ocbc investment research (nov 19): we expect ecs to benefit from new product launches, by major it vendors that it has established a strong working relationship with. one example is apple, which launched its ipad air in november 2013.  we also expect some contribution from apples iphone 5s, but by a smaller amount, given the android operating systems continued market share gain. lenovo  another important it vendor for ecs  highlighted during its recent 2qfy14 analyst briefing, that it expects its core pc business to benefit from the corporate refresh cycle and gradual recovery in chinas pc market. this will provide a boost to ecs prospects. industry watcher gartner also forecast it spending to grow 5.5% and 8.7% in asia-pacific and china, in 2014 respectively. we fine-tune our assumptions, after taking into account this latest set of results, and raise our fair value estimate from s$0.56 to s$0.585, as we roll forward our valuations to six times fy14f eps.  ecs share price has performed well, since we highlighted it as our top pick in the tech sector on july 15, 2013, rising 13.5%, compared with the stis 1% decline during the same period. maintain buy as valuations remain undemanding, with the stock trading at fy14f 0.55 times net total assets, and 5.6 times earnings. sa sa international holdings ltdtarget price: hk$9.97 buy uobkayhian research (nov 19): sa sas 1hfy14 net profit growth of 26.7% y-o-y, to hk$357 million, beat market expectations and represented 35.4% of our fy14 full-year forecasts  in line with historical trends.  to stimulate sales, the company tweaked its marketing strategy from heavily promoting new products, to focusing on best-sellers. as a result, in-house brand products contributed to 44.2% of total sales in 1hfy14  up from 42.5% in fy13, lifting overall gross margins. despite weaker consumer sentiment in 2013, sa sas hong kong stores continued to deliver impressive growth rates, with same-store sales growth (sssg) of 18%, as at november 2013.  sssg, however, fell 6.9% in china, as the company has yet to gain strong traction with consumers there. 1hfy14 net losses from china expanded to hk$27 million, from hk$19.8 million in 1hfy13. weak inventory management was partly to blame, but we think the strategy to focus on in-house brands with higher margins, will take more time.  sa sa plans to have house brands account for 50% of total sales, in three to five years time, and is looking to cooperate with south korean companies, to achieve this. on the back of our earnings upgrades and rolling forward of our target valuation from fy14 to fy15, our new target price is hk$9.97, being 22 times earnings. ayala corptarget price: php768 buy maybank kim eng research (nov 19): we reiterate our buy rating on ayala and increase our target price to php768, from php759 previously, as we align our forecasts with the 3qfy13 results. our new target price factors in its recent acquisition of an additional 4.3% stake in bank of the philippine islands (bpi). the acquisition price of php84 per share, is lower than our fair-value estimate for bpi of php96 per share, thus the transaction will increase ayalas net asset value (nav) by php3 per share. at our new target price, the potential upside is 29%. ayala land inc contributed php13.96 billion or 80% of ayalas earnings, while globe telecom inc and manila water co inc contributed php2.85 billion, or the remaining 20%.  global telecoms reported that income declined 48% to php3.5 billion, but excluding the impact of the accelerated depreciation from the modernisation programme, core income grew 9% to php9.5 billion. we lowered our earnings forecasts on ayala by 10%, to php14.26 billion for 2013, to reflect our lower trading income assumption for bpi. although the banks core banking business performed broadly as expected, trading income fell short of our target. thus, we reduce our 2013 earnings estimate on bpi, by 16%.pt mitrabahtera segara sejati tbktarget price: idr1,400 buy rhb research (nov 20): we believe mitrabahtera should be able to book higher coal volumes in 2013 and 2014, despite the possibility of clients renegotiating their rates, as long-term customers will bulk up volumes to compensate for lower fees.  we trim our 2013 and 2014 earnings estimates by 5% and 9% respectively, as 9mfy13 net profit fell short of our expectations, accounting for 67% of fy13f numbers. although total coal volume transported in 9mfy13 reached 57 million tonnes (77% of fy13f), mitrabahtera charged rates that were lower than our expectations. thus, we cut our blended fee per tonne assumptions across its segments, by 10% and 18%, for 2013 and 2014 respectively, as we predict that it would shift to shorter-distance trips and offer competitive or lower rates to customers, amid a challenging coal market. we also raise our aggregate coal volume assumption by 8-19%, for 2013-14. with mitrabahtera having a cash pile of us$30 million as at 9mfy13, we are assuming a reasonable 25% dividend payout policy for 2013 earnings, which translates into an attractive 6% dividend yield for 2014. despite cutting its estimates, the stock is still trading at a very cheap four times 2013-14 earnings. we maintain a buy call, but lower our discounted cash flow-based target price to idr1,400 (from idr1,500), while trimming our earnings estimates for 2013 and 2014. midas holdings ltdfair value: s$0.67 buy ocbc investment research (nov 18): midas 3qfy13 results exceeded our expectations, with revenue jumping 48.5% y-o-y to rmb301 million, or 15.8% above our forecast.  gross margin of 20.8%, down 10.7 percentage points, disappointed due to a change in the product mix, as more aluminium extrusion profile deliveries were made to the lower margin freight wagons, while there was also an increase in per unit production cost. nevertheless, the bottom line reversed from a rmb6.1 million net loss in 3qfy12, to a net profit of rmb16.4 million. midas recently clinched rmb167.5 million of contracts to supply aluminium alloy extrusion profiles, for the manufacture of high-speed railway (hsr) train cars. we expect the bulk of this contribution to be booked in 4qfy13, with the remainder in 1qfy14, due to the tight delivery schedules from customers. meanwhile, china railway corporation recently opened the second round of hsr train car tenders. this involves a total of 258 train car sets, of which 78 are for a speed of 250kph, and 180 for a speed of 350kph (higher value). we believe the potential market size for aluminium alloy extrusion profile suppliers, may amount to rmb715.5 million. we estimate that midas could secure rmb325 million to rmb380 million of contracts from its customers, from this procurement exercise, in late december 2013 or early january 2014. this story first appeared in the edge weekly edition of nov 25-dec 1, 2013."}, "785":

equities had a good run in 2013, with the 30-stock benchmark fbm klci touching an all-time intra-day high of 1,882.2 on the last trading day of the year, closing at 1,866.96. against 2013s gain of 10.54% for the klci, research houses targets for 2014 appear slightly muted. a look at some research houses klci targets for 2014 showed year-end forecasts ranging from 1,920 to 2,030 points, with cimb research having the most optimistic forecast. the research house cited a well-executed economic transformation programme as a key catalyst for its optimism in the broader market as well as more subdued political risks after the 13th general election. maybank investment bank research, which has a klci target of 1,940 points, pointed out that malaysias strong macro-economic fundamentals and corporate balance sheet strength bodes well despite expensive valuations for malaysian equities. political concerns have diminished, fiscal balance issues are being addressed and domestic liquidity remains ample. while the klcis16.3 times one-year forward per [price-earnings ratio] on an 8.1% earnings growth offering implies a rather pricey price-earnings to growth of two times, the sustainability of malaysias longer term growth on strong macro-economic policies and banking and corporate balance sheet strength will continue to lend support to the premium rating, said the research house in its strategy report. we expect malaysian equities defensiveness to stand out yet again amid external volatilities in 2014, albeit at a milder level with the us qe [quantitative easing] taper being priced in, it added. the seven research houses targets averaged out to 1,957, equating to a 4.8% increase for the index, which closed at 1,866.96 on tuesday. this is lower than the 10.54% increase in the klci in 2013. the lower growth expectations came amidst concerns mainly of a pullback of foreign funds as a result of federal reserve tapering of its quantitative easing policy and poorer consumer sentiment due to fiscal consolidation. a pullback in foreign investor funds in asian markets is expected after the fed announced its decision to taper by us$10 billion (rm32.8 billion)

malaysia, along with indonesia, india and thailand appear to be the most vulnerable to a disorderly qe unwind scenario. this is due to higher than average equity inflows to local stocks since 2011, non-financial sector corporate net debt, and economy-wide private-sector debt, it said. michael kurtz, global head of equity strategy at nomura equity research, said that the best performing sectors in 2014 are likely to be externally focused. we are not negative on domestic cyclical stocks per se  malaysia is one of the economies we feel more confident with, along with philippines and south korea, he said in a phone interview with the edge financial daily. however, defensive stocks such as telcos, utilities and consumer staples are likely to underperform in 2014 and we have recently downgraded telcos to underweight, he said. according to bharat, the education and healthcare sector are key focus areas in malaysian equities for 2014, while consumer staples and telcos are on the wary watchlist. generally, investors are looking at where malaysias strengths are  malaysia wants to be the education and healthcare hub, and the reason for that is because we have plenty of landbank. we are tapping on both singapores expensive healthcare  where we see singaporeans coming over to johor  and benefiting from the setting up of education hubs in johor and private schools around kuala lumpur, said bharat. well-to-do indonesians who are looking for good healthcare but who do not wish to pay singapore prices are coming to malaysia, he said. on the education sector, he said education providers who are keen on expanding are an indicator of the positive outlook on the sector, pointing to epsom college set up by airasia bhds tan sri tony fernandes. bharat said: the government is also trying to push visit malaysia 2014  we are seeing theme parks coming into the market and that could be a pull factor.  increased tourism should play quite a role because when local domestic consumption slows, they can easily take over and thats quite crucial because we still need to iron the chains of consumption  if people are not consuming, at least your tourism sector picks up, so thats positive. what we are going to see is more intra-asean trade in certain sectors taking a role rather than fdis from the west coming into the market, he said, adding that he foresees consumer staples, property and reits underperforming in the coming year. meanwhile, most research houses are neutral on the telco sector due to intensifying competition, decline in sms revenues and increased capital expenditure. they remain bullish on oil and gas, construction, aviation and utilities. the sectors most have a cautious view on are consumer, property, automotive and gaming. nevertheless, cimb is bullish on gaming and property. it said it believes the governments measures to curb speculation will be short lived and buyers appetite will return in the second half of 2014. meanwhile, bharat is neutral on telcos and consumers. i would say that consumer names which have been very strong this year and the last would see some profit taking  companies the likes of nestle (malaysia) bhd, dutch lady milk industries bhd, fraser & neave holdings bhd might experience some headwinds in terms of being able to grow their topline, so they would be the ones that might see some profit-taking as valuations for the consumer sector are not cheap, he said. i think that the outlook for 2014 is going to be slightly below expectations and a lot more cautious and the reason for that is because there is a lot more challenges, both external and internal, he added. this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on january 02, 2014."}, "796": {"date_posted": "2/1/2014",

airasia bhd has often been regarded as one of the cheapest low-cost carriers in the world and at its current valuation; some investors may find its stock attractive. airasias share price has declined by more than 10% since the budget airline announced its nine-month results ended sept 30, 2013 that came below expectations. airasia group chief executive officer tan sri tony fernandes told the edge financial daily that investors should pick up the undervalued stock given its prospects. he said shareholders should be in it for long term as the group moves into its next phase of development to become the emirates of the asia-pacific region.  i am in for the long term and want to give shareholders value, he said in a recent interview. fernandes and his partner datuk kamarudin meranun have deemed interest of 23% in airasia via tune air sdn bhd. he advised shareholders to be patient despite the fluctuating share prices of airasia. we are not the hot girl in town but if you are a long-time investor, the upsides will be good, he said without elaborating further. the drop in airasias share price was mainly due to a sell-down by foreign shareholders, paring their shareholding to 49% as at end november from 52% in the first half of 2013. at the current level, airasia shares are trading at an undemanding financial year 2014 price-to-earnings ratio of just over seven times. the counter closed at rm2.22 on dec 31, 2013, down 12.9% for the year. however, not all analysts recommend a buy on the stock due to the increasingly competitive environment at home. cimb research, for one, lowered the target price of airasia from rm3.05 to rm2.55 and downgraded it from outperform to neutral. the research house noted that yield pressure on the budget airline will persist in 2014 with newcomer malindo air and national carrier malaysian airline system bhd (mas). however, rhb research in a december note said airasias share price may have hit the bottom at the rm2.22-level, and view the stock as a bargain. it also believes that airasia will continue to be more prudent on costs come 2014 and more importantly, should malindo air and mas get more conservative in their future expansion plans and pricing strategies, the downward pressure on air asias yields will dissipate. meanwhile, airasia said that it is not overly worried about the rising fare war in the domestic market, where the airline commands a 60% share, and intends to hit back in the competition. fernandes: i am in for the long term and want to give shareholders value. furthermore, fernandes and kamarudin, who was recently redesignated as executive chairman of airasia, have announced that they will now play a more active role in the airline with emphasis on further cost reduction.fernandes and kamarudin announced last month their return to malaysia just over a year, after passing on the baton to new airasia ceo aireen omar to lead domestic operations while the duo lead regional operations out of jakarta, indonesia. additionally, fernandes said the airasia story will also include its plans for its 13.76% affiliate airasia x bhd. airasia x, with 16 planes to date, will have 57 planes including six leased ones by 2019, said fernandes.  the long-haul budget carrier had earlier this month made its largest single order of airbus sas wide-body aircraft for us$6 billion (rm19.68 billion). with the fleet expansion, fernandes said the plan is for airasia x to resume european routes and likely add new york to its list of new routes to the us. he added that the group is already putting into plans for airasia x to return to paris and london by 2016 after it axed the routes in 2012. fernandes said with airasias extensive network, the group is adding a new dimension that will enable airasia x and airasia to offer a seamless experience where the baggage system and one fare price will be applicable to passengers. this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on
