[the impact of] brent, at us$70 (rm275.10) per barrel today, is the same as us$85 per barrel before, because their (o&g firms) cost has come down for about us$15. i think the rally will continue. im actually a little bit excited about o&g sector, he said. he pointed out that he appreciates the efforts by malaysian companies such as sime darby group in enhancing shareholders value by undertaking restructuring exercises. im looking forward to more restructuring efforts as such, from the likes of malayan banking bhd and cimb group holdings bhd, he said. meanwhile, cheah said bursa malaysia should consider setting up a new board that allows local technology companies to undertake a dual-class-share structure listing. the promoters and founders of technology companies typically want to retain control, even if they have sold some shares. you must allow that (dual-class shares) to attract them.\n"}, "1": {"date_posted": "24/1/2018", "title": "kpj, digi.com, igb reit, axis reit, caring

(petchem) financial year 2017 (fy17) results (tentatively out on feb 20) could be slightly ahead of our expectations on a stronger-than-expected average selling price (asp), which is benefiting from the uptrend in crude oil prices. petchems share price has spiked 9% in the past month and is now close to our tp of rm8.50 (9.1 times 2018 enterprise value against earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) (10% premium to industry peers). due to a limited upside to our tp, the stock is now a hold. we estimate a core profit after tax and minority interest (patmi) of rm1.15 bilion for the fourth quarter of fy17 (4qfy17) (+11% year-on-year [y-o-y]; +25% quarter-on-quarter [q-o-q]) based on an 8.5% higher y-o-y asp of rm3,397 per tonne. we forecast its 4qfy17 factory utilisation rate to be lower at 82% (-13 percentage points [ppts] y-o-y; -4ppts q-o-q); this is due to closure of the labuan methanol plant due to a scheduled turnaround. the cumulative fy17 patmi of rm4.34 billion represents 103% and 105% of our full fy17 and consensus forecasts. year to date, the blended asp is flattish y-o-y at rm3,384 per tonne, consistent with our fy18 forecast for a flat y-o-y asp. however, given that crude oil prices have been rising, and given the fact that petrochemical prices tend to track crude oil prices, there is an upside potential to our asp assumption. a 1% change in naphtha prices versus our base case (on a full-year basis) will move our fy18 earnings forecast by rm50 million, or 1.2%. however, it is still early in 2018 and we will monitor the situation closely. petchems valuations are already above the industry peer average, justified by its superior balance sheet and cash flows. for now, the stock is a hold and we recommend holding its shares for a

the world including malaysia since the start of the year has caught many off guard. the excitement is set to continue for bursa malaysia ahead of the 14th general election (ge14), with the local market showing first signs of the much-anticipated pre-election rally since jan 3. the market has been on a strong upward trend amid the recovering ringgit and stronger oil price. talk of a pre-election rally has resurfaced among investors, as well as in the media. while we see some profit-taking activities as we approach the end of our second week of trading, we believe the weakness in the market presents a good buying opportunity for investors and traders, rakuten trade sdn bhd head of research kenny yee told the edge financial daily. we think that the high spirits leading to the elections, as well as the euphoria in the stock market seen in the developed markets will fuel the momentum in the domestic stock market, he added. echoing the same sentiment, ta securities research head kaladher govindan is of the view that the strong run in the benchmark index so far this year is in line with expectations. it was within our expectations if you follow our strategy reports. we expect the fbm klci to hit 1,890 points in the first half of 2018 (1h18), especially in the first quarter before retreating in 2h18, kaladher said via email. in its annual strategy report published on dec 8 last year, ta securities wrote that expectations of a ge14 rally should propel the fbm klci higher in 1h18, premised on the assumption the elections will be held in march or april this year. however, kaladher highlighted a possible correction in the market in 1h18. a barisan nasional victory could hold up on the market momentarily, but we reckon the fbm klci could be due for a correction in 2h18 as concerns over the us monetary tightening and ringgit weakness reverberate across the market and translate into heavy foreign selling and a risk-averse strategy among investors, he added. however, kaladher noted that the downside pressure can emerge sooner in 1h18 if the current ruling coalitions power base crumbles after the elections. affin hwang asset management is also optimistic about a better year in 2018 and expects the fbm klci to see a 6% to 8% upside, tracking market earnings growth. analysts are starting the year with a projection of 9% to 10% [growth]. the expectation is that the stronger ringgit will lead to margin expansion [as opposed to contraction] for domestic-oriented companies, its senior associate director of equities cheryl pola said. the fbm klci has climbed 8.6% over the past year. however, cimb investment bank head of malaysia research ivy ng believes the market still has legs to run, maintaining an end-2018 fbm klci target of 1,880 points. the local market ended the week on a positive note last week, with the fbm klci closing 5.79 points or 0.32% higher at 1,822.67. market breadth was positive with 643 gainers versus 389 losers. taking a look at the 30 constituents of the fbm klci, the best-performing stock so far is sime darby bhd. the counter climbed 22.2% year to date (ytd) to close at rm2.70 last friday. this was followed by petronas gas bhd and ytl corp bhd, with gains of 8.7% and 8% respectively. six of the fbm klci component stocks were on a downtrend, with klccp stapled group emerging as the worst performer ytd, falling 9.1% to close unchanged at rm7.85 last friday. apart from axiata group bhd, the telecommunication sector has turned out to be a laggard ytd, with shares in digi.com bhd and telekom malaysia

the opposite direction of sime darby. despite a strong start to the year, the fbm klci is still underperforming its regional peers and developed markets. the edge financial daily has spoken to several heads of research on some of the potential stocks they see among the component stocks that could run higher on the back of the positive sentiment in the global equity market, recovering oil prices and the ringgit, as well as the boost from the upcoming ge14. 1) tenaga nasional bhd a screaming buy among analysts, tenaga nasional bhd (tnb) rose 3.4% in the first two weeks of the year. most analysts continue to favour tnb as bloomberg data shows that 20 out of 25 analysts that cover the stock have a buy call. according to rakuten trades yee, the utility companys valuation is undemanding and provides decent dividend yield. at its closing price of rm15.78 last friday, tnb is trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio (per) of 12.9 times and has a dividend yield of about 3.9%. tnb is also cimbs top three big caps for 2018 as ng sees the stock offer a resilient organic earnings growth potential. according to her, it is building four new power plants in malaysia, which could raise its generation earnings in 2017 to 2020. she also pointed out that stronger earnings driven by the new assets tnb acquired in the past year are another potential rerating catalyst. ta securities, which has a target price (tp) of rm17.38 for tnb, indicating a potential return of about 10%, has also picked the utility company as one of its top picks. ta securities analyst kylie chan sze zan said in an annual strategy report that tnb is attractive on most valuation metrics, including a 10.9 times forward per, which is one standard deviation below historical average, 7.1 times forward enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, which is an 18% discount to regional peers. based on bloombergs consensus data, the 12-month tp for tnb is at rm16.61, indicating a potential return of 5.3%. tnb was also one of the stocks that featured on the edge financial dailys top 10 picks for 2018. 2) axiata group bhd axiata group bhd is expected to perform in 2018 as the telecommunication company is expected to see an improvement in its earnings after witnessing four consecutive years of earnings contraction at its operating companies  celcom axiata bhd and indonesias pt xl axiata tbk. the turnaround appears to be expected by the market as seen by the gain of 1.1% in the first 10 trading days of 2018. this was in contrast to its share price performance in the last three years where it fell by about 14.6%. according to cimbs ng, axiatas core earnings per share is expected to rebound by a strong 29% and 50% for its forecast for financial years ending dec 31, 2018 and 2019 respectively due to much higher contributions from xl, net profit break-even for airtel bangladesh ltd by end-2018 and cessation in equity accounting for ideas losses post-merger with vodafone. rakutens yee concurred, noting that axiatas digital transformation is expected to bring an improvement to its earnings. other than that, the news flow of a potential initial public offering of its tower unit, edotco group sdn bhd, this year is also another catalyst for axiata, he said. 3) banking sector cimb, maybank affin hwang asset managements pola is of the view that banks are among those that could do well in 2018. this year has been about improvement in asset quality. in 2018, we should see stronger pre-provision growth, especially if interest rates rise, which will lead to net interest margin expansion [but to a lesser extent compared to its singapore counterparts], she said. she added that loan growth should be slightly stronger after the disappointing 2017. pola, however, noted that there is still an overhang on the sector as the impact of malaysian financial reporting standards 9 (mfrs9) has yet to be fully known but if the impact on provisions or book values is low as expected, it would clear another uncertainty that remains for the banking sector. our top picks are cimb group holdings bhd (inexpensive valuations) and malayan banking bhd (maybank) (possibility of capital management after mfrs9, better cash dividends, the possible listing of etiqa). hong leong bank bhd has impressive fundamentals but valuations are a bit stretched, she added. similar to pola, rakutens yee highlighted that both cimb and maybank could be proxy for foreign buying into the banking sector. maybank is also a defensive play with its relatively high dividend yield of over 5%, he added. ta securities also picked cimb as one of its top picks for 2018 in its annual strategy report. its analyst wong li hsia said cimb has been outpacing its peers in terms of yearly profit growth since the fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2015. she also pointed that better prospects in cimb niaga and cimb thai as one of the investment themes that will drive cimb. credit charges have eased. while we forecast the overall credit charge to remain elevated, we believe the worst  in terms of asset quality may be over, led by further recoveries in its overseas operations, wong said. cimbs share price gained 3.7% ytd to close at rm6.78 last friday, while maybanks share price edged higher by 0.5% to rm9.85. 4. petronas gas bhd the selldown at the end of last year created a value proportion for those who are interested in investing in petronas gas bhd (petgas). the share price fell by 4.8% compared with three years ago to its closing price of rm19.00 last friday. petgas share price fell to its low of rm15.88 in november last year compared with its three-year peak of rm22.02 in october 2015. yee believes that the selldown was overdone and was mainly due to third-party access framework concern. while the market has recovered by 19.6% from its low since then, petgas is still trading at about 4.9% below its three-year average price of rm19.93.\n"}, "5": {"date_posted": "4/1/2018", "title": "capital: the edge best call awards 2017", "article": " pickings were better this year, with several stocks performing much better than expected

tracking the stock  implying only 6.4% upside potential. risks to his forecast include a sharply weaker greenback, lower aluminium prices and unexpected production disruptions. a notable mention also goes to kenanga researchs voon yee ping, who also rightly stuck with a buy recommendation this year despite the strong price gains. two other houses had neutral calls from april and august when the stock was below rm3.50, bloomberg data show. it remains to be seen if press metal will provide reasons for further bullishness but the stock did reach rm5.47 intraday on dec 4, although its highest close so far was rm5.184 on nov 6.  nomura researchs tushar mohatas call on sunway construction group bhd in a nutshell, this is a winning call because the stock price ran shortly after an upgrade to buy from hold. but theres more depth than that. when nomura researchs tushar mohata upgraded sunway construction group bhd to buy on march 9 this year, the share price rose 45% within nine months to as high as rm2.41 on dec 11, before retracing to rm2.38 on dec 15. before the upgrade, the stock price had largely been hovering between rm1.50 and rm1.60 for about a year. his decision to upgrade sunway construction resulted from what he calls an earnings-cash flow matrix as well as the law of diminishing returns at a time when most construction companies were already sitting on record-sized order books. a high base means small and medium-sized project awards could mean very little incremental impact on future earnings and share price. that came after he revisited nomuras investment thesis for the malaysian construction sector. while net profit remains the best long-term predictor for stock price returns, he told clients that the cash conversion of reported earnings was becoming equally important due to rising gearing in a weak property market. the latter was the reason tushar preferred pure-play malaysian contractors like sunway construction to diversified contractors with exposure to property development. according to him, sunway constructions earnings fairly accurately track its actual cash flows, reflective of its healthy margins and timely collection from customers. thats a better position than companies which may have good reported earnings but subpar conversion of it to operating cash flow due to reasons such as non-cash earnings stream and growing working capital, which leads to higher gearing (thus burdening the balance sheet). a notable mention also goes to macquarie researchs aiman mohamad, who has had a buy call on sunway construction since at least march 2016, according to bloomberg data. both nomura and macquarie currently have the streets most bullish target price of rm2.80.  affin hwang capital researchs kevin lows call on inari amertron bhd inari amertron saw its stock price more than double this year. affin hwangs kevin low, started coverage as early as april 23, 2013, when the comparable stock price was 16 sen. he continues to like inari, calling it a preferred pick for the local technology sector due to its solid growth in the rf segment given new drivers, including the osram iris ir chip, and its data server chip business from broadcom. key downside risks to his recommendation include a slowdown in global demand for smart devices, rapid average sale price (asp) erosion, loss of customer base and the introduction of new technologies that may render inaris products obsolete. according to bloomberg data, there is currently one fully valued call from dbs vickers with a rm2.25 target price. six analysts have hold or neutral calls on inari while the remaining six (including low) recommend as buy. time will tell who will prove prescient this time next year. this year, a notable mention also goes to macquarie researchs anand pathmakanthan, as clients would have benefited from his upgrade from neutral to outperform in january when the stock price was rm1.60. similarly, rhb researchs kong heng siong upgraded his call to buy when the stock price was rm1.90 on march 22. credit suisses danny chan, who started coverage with an outperform call on july 11 when the stock was at rm2.13 apiece, also deserves a notable mention.   affin hwang capital researchs kevin lows call on kesm industries bhd when starting coverage on kesm industries on aug 15, 2016, affin hwangs kevin low told clients the company was a good proxy for the stable and growing automotive semiconductor segment, going by growing demand for electronics for vehicles from safety to infotainment and autonomous vehicles. in just four months, the stock has gained 34%  making him a winner last year. he continues his winning ways this year: at rm19.50 on dec 15, kesm shares had doubled from the start of the year  and theres still upside if lows rm21.80 target price is to be believed. in fact, kesm reached as high as rm20.50 intraday on nov 23 before closing at rm20.40. we favour kesm for its exposure to the automotive space, an area we believe will continue to benefit from structural growth underpinned by increased semiconductor content in automobiles as well as growth in demand for hybrid and autonomous vehicles, low wrote in a dec 18 note, reiterating his buy call. in an earlier note dated nov 24, he told clients that kesms revenue and earnings momentum remained strong, underpinned by aggressive capital expenditure into the automotive burn and test business. he also noted that 1qfy7/2018 net profit would have been stronger if not for higher effective tax rate of 15.5% versus 10.4% in 1qfy7/2017. key downside risks include a loss of customers and a reduction in the outsourcing opportunities as customers increase their in-house burn-in and test function, he says. two other analysts have since started coverage on kesm this year, according to bloomberg data. cimb research has an add rating and rm22 target price while kenanga research is going against consensus with an underperform call and rm18.40 target price, which is below open market prices. it would be interesting to see if low will make it a hat trick next year.   kaf seagroatt & campbell securities mak hoy kens call on econpile holdings bhd econpile holdings shares have gained as much as 77.6% this year, closing at rm3.195 on dec 4. even measured from this years cut-off date of dec 15, gains came to an enviable 73%. in a dec 29 note last year, kafs mak hoy ken retained his buy call. he sees econpile as the research houses top small-cap construction pick for its burgeoning order book, sustained job momentum and attractive margins. the civil engineering contractors market capitalisation breached rm1 billion in late october 2016. back then, he also told clients that more strategic opportunities could stem from econpiles 60:40 tie-up with china communications construction co (m) sdn bhd (cccc) for a substructure and ancillary works package for suke highway, as it was a strong endorsement of econpiles position as a piling specialist in malaysia. at the time of writing, maks target price of rm3.33 implies only 7% upside potential from rm3.11 on dec 15. it remains to be seen just how much comfort should be drawn from his oct 20 note, where he said econpiles earnings visibility remains solid, backed by a healthy outstanding order book of rm1.2 billion or around 2.1 times its construction revenue. meanwhile, macquarie researchs aiman mohamad, who started coverage with an outperform call on feb 23 this year when the stock price was at rm2.07 apiece, also deserves a notable mention, with econpile shares up 50.2% to rm3.11 apiece in about 10 months. macquarie has a rm3.50 target price.  \nkaf seagroatt & campbell securities mak hoy kens call on ann joo resources bhd with shares of ann joo resources bhd up 83% to rm3.80 as at dec 15 this year, investors who bought the stock at the start of the year would be sitting on good portfolio gains. kafs mak hoy ken maintained a buy on the stock with a higher target price of rm2.42 (from rm2.38) on jan 5. the stock dipped to rm2.17  its lowest this year  on jan 3. at its peak, it closed as high as rm3.91 on nov 9. back then, ann joos share price had just gained 224% in 2016 and there were doubts in the market on whether the stock would continue to perform, especially with the direction of international steel prices being mixed at best. mak was held to his belief that there was more upside to ann joo. among other things, he argued that domestic steel prices would see support from provisional safeguard duties on imported bars and wire rods. with the counter trading at only eight to 10 times forward earnings multiples, he was convinced it was a cheaper alternative play to the malaysian infrastructure supercycle. there is also a potential lift from a continued recovery in chinese steel prices as capacity cuts in that country gathers pace. chinese steel prices have been on a general upward trend this year as the countrys supply-side reforms took effect. a notable mention goes to maybank investment bank researchs lee yen ling, who upgraded her call for ann joo on aug 16, 2016, when the stock price was at rm1.72. at the time of writing, maybanks lee has since downgraded her call to hold with a rm3.85 target price while kafs mak continues to call a buy with a rm4.10 target price. watch this space.  \nkenanga researchs desmond chongs call on malaysian pacific industries bhd it was almost as if he had a crystal ball. when kenanga researchs desmond chong upgraded his call on malaysian pacific industries (mpi) from market perform to buy on jan 27, the stock price ran up 79% from rm7.97 to rm14.291 on oct 11. helping the gains were the better sales that mpi was seeing of its automotive electronics and power management chips as well as improved efficiency. he subsequently raised his target price three more times to as high as rm15.70 on aug 18. thats not all. when chong turned cautious on its outlook and downgraded mpi to market perform or a neutral stance on nov 10, the stock price retraced 12% fromrm13.64 to rm12 on dec 15. in a nov 10 note issued following a briefing, he highlighted the mounting pressure on margins coupled with a potential setback from a longer gestation period for its product rationalisation exercise. a special mention also goes to kaf seagroatt & campbell securities shafiq kadir and ta securitiess paul yap, who earlier had buy calls that also proved right. kenangas call got more points as mpi shares ran shortly after his upgrade compared with the two existing buy calls. all three currently have hold calls on mpi, in line with consensus. at the time of writing, affin hwang capital research had the only sell on the stock, with a target price of rm12, according to bloomberg data. will he have the last laugh next year?  \nuob kay hian researchs ridhwan effendys call on kerjaya prospek group bhd investors who made money might recall that uob kay hians retail research team started coverage on kerjaya prospek as far back as january 2016 when it was still called fututech bhd. the team called the stock an upcoming mid-cap construction company that would emerge as an end-to-end building contractor with rm2.7 billion order book after completing the acquisition of two privately-run construction companies. at the time, the (adjusted) stock price was rm1.69. as at dec 15, it had gained 134% to rm3.97, although that is off as high as rm4.08 on nov 3. this year, alone, kerjaya shares were up 83% at the time of writing. on jan 3, uobs ridhwan effendy told clients that 2017 would continue to be an eventful year for kerjaya  which stands out as a potential capital management play  given its strong cash pile of rm107 million or 10% of its market capitalisation back then. according to bloomberg data at the time of writing, uob is the only house still calling a buy on kerjaya, while the remaining two houses with active coverage have neutral or underperform. the underperform call, made in early august when the share price was rm3.54, but the stock is at rm3.97 currently. uob upgraded the stock to buy again on nov 23 with a higher target price of rm4.53 (from rm3.81) after raising its earnings estimates as well as order book win assumptions. ridhwan continues to like kerjaya for its superior margins, high order book cover, net cash of rm163 million (28.9 sen per share) and ability to clinch new contracts.  \nuob kay hian researchs ridhwan effendys call on sunsuria bhd uob kay hian was the first house to initiate coverage on sunsuria nearly three years ago. at the time, the headline recommendation was hold, based on a 50% discount to its sum-of-parts valuation. nonetheless, the research house told clients that it expected the company to take on a major asset acquisition strategy: investors with the risk appetite for small-caps should consider re-entering ahead of the announcement which is expected to be in 1q2015, it said in a brief note dated feb 18, 2015. that gives this submission an edge over others. based on where the stock is today post the corporate developments, the equivalent (adjusted) stock price would be 86.8 sen. a simplistic measurement would show a 78.6% gain at its recent peak of rm1.55 on july 14, 2017. uob kay hians ridhwan effendy raised his target price to rm1.25 (from rm1) when reiterating a buy call on jan 12 this year as he expected sunsuria to enter a multi-year growth phase. riding on the success of xiamen university, ridhwan expects its flagship sunsuria city development to be a key driver for sales and earnings. sunsurias stock price took only about a month to reach the new target price and on feb28, ridhwan raised the target price to rm1.50  which the stock hit on april 10 before retracing to rm1.40-levels. on may 25, ridhwan downgraded the stock to hold with an unchanged target price after the release of the companys 2qfy2017 earnings, telling investors to capitalise on their gains as he believed its near-term potential had been reflected after a 42% year-to-date climb. at the time, the stock price was rm1.41 and the highest it went was a 9.9% rise to a recent high of rm1.55 on july 17 before retracing to rm1.34, about 5% lower than at the point of downgrade.  \naminvestment bank researchs alex gohs call on petronas gas bhd aminvestment banks alex goh got it right when he cut petronas gas to sell from hold on nov 18 with a rm16.65 target price while the stock was trading at rm20-levels. from there, the price skidded 22% to as low as rm15.88 on nov 30. the magnitude of the fall is considerably sharp, given that petronas gas is a big-cap counter with a market capitalisation of rm33.6 billion. in fact, between nov 18 last year and the recent low on nov 30, it lost a whopping rm10.1 billion in market capitalisation. when downgrading his call more than a year ago, goh told clients about the chances of impending earnings erosion given the energy commissions upcoming plan to implement incentive-based regulation (ibr) tariffs on the groups gas transport tariff. that made it hard to justify the companys valuation and share price of above rm20. on dec 5, goh seemed to have also rightly upgraded petronas gas to a hold with a rm16.65 target price when the share price was at rm16.10. closing at rm16.96 on dec 21, the stock had gained 5.3%. meanwhile, it is worth noting that ta securities analyst kylie chan also had a sell call on the stock, according to bloomberg data, when many others on the street still said hold.  \ninter-pacific securities researchs wong ling lings call on uchi technologies bhd 2017 has been a spectacular year for uchi technology, as was inter-pacific securities researchs wong ling lings buy call on the company. the companys share price had gained between 13% and 30% a year between 2012 and 2016 and this year was beginning to look that way as well until a sharp rally occurred from the middle of the year, barely a fortnight from the time she started coverage on the stock with a buy call. uchis performance likely surprised even her. only three analysts are actively tracking uchi, according to bloomberg data. when wong started coverage on june 15, uchi shares were at rm1.84 a share. from there, it rocketed 93% in just over five months to rm3.55 on nov 29. at rm3.45 on dec 15, uchis market capitalisation stood at rm1.57 billion compared with about rm800 million just six months earlier. wongs buy recommendation was premised on the companys stable earnings growth, unique business model, a minimum dividend payout ratio of 70% of profit after tax, very comfortable profit margins and a clientele comprised of industry market leaders. it would be interesting to see if uchi, which specialises in the design of electronic control systems for a number of multinational companies that are global leaders in their respective industries, can continue to surprise on the upside next year.  \nhong leong investment bank researchs jeremy gohs call on george kent (m) bhd this time last year, hlib researchs jeremy goh was the only analyst actively tracking george kent, telling clients that the water meter-turned-engineering company had rm5.1 billion engineering order book and can no longer be ignored. today, he is one of three analysts calling a buy on the company he described as one with 68 sen per share net cash and a key rail play with exposure to the lrt extensions. his target price is currently rm3.90. closing at rm3.62 on dec 15, george kent shares had gained 83% year to date, continuing its ascent from the year before. in a dec 7 note after the companys third quarter earnings briefing, goh noted that george kent  which is the leader for water meters in malaysia, with over a 50% market share  could see the opening of a whole new market for itself when it commercialises its automated meter reading (amr) product, which allows remote reading of water meters. selangor is expected to call tenders for amr meters in two months for a pilot project while johor and penang are also looking to replace traditional meters, goh said. the company (via a joint venture with siemens) is also preparing to put in a bid for the kuala lumpur-singapore high-speed rail (hsr) asset company (assetsco) that will help develop key parts of the project. that may provide further catalysts for the stock next year.  \nuob kay hian researchs kong ho mengs call on sapura energy bhd when analysts rushed to revise their buy and neutral calls on sapura energy bhd in early december, after a large quarterly net loss, uob kay hian researchs kong ho meng stood out as he had had a sell call for close to six months. the stock tumbled 20% in a single day on dec 7, after the group announced a quarterly net loss of rm274.4 million for the third quarter ended oct 31, a sharp contrast to a net profit of rm158 million the year before. looking back, we see that the share price had in fact been drifting lower since mid-june when the consensus view was that the oil and gas giant was in calmer waters as the recovery of global crude oil prices gathered steam. kongs timely downgrade of his call from neutral to sell on june 20 would have saved clients from sizeable portfolio losses. from rm1.67, the stock price tumbled 53% to 78.5 sen at our award evaluation cut-off date of dec 15. when the edge went to print, the stock price had slid further to a record low of 71.5 sen on dec 21. a notable mention goes to credit suisses danny chan, who also went against the grain with a contrarian sell call since june, although he prematurely upped his recommendation to neutral while the counter was still heading south.  \naffin hwang capital researchs ng chi hoongs call on jaks resources bhd jaks resources is not well tracked by analysts, many of whom may feel the need to observe the company from the sidelines for the time being since its power generation project in vietnam will only start contributing in 2020 and be a good source of recurring income. the lack of coverage makes affin hwang capitals ng chi hoongs buy recommendation and analysis stand out even more. those familiar with the company would know jaks is undertaking a us$1.87 billion 1,200mw coal-fired thermal power plant project near hai duong, together with china power engineering consulting group co ltd (cpecc). jaks holds a 30% stake in the joint venture and cpecc the remaining 70%. in a jan 4 note, ng raised his target price for jaks to rm2 (from rm1.60) following a review of its assets after the company said it was realigning its focus on vietnam given the slowdown in the property market in malaysia. at the time, jaks share price was at rm1.01. it took barely three months to jump 70% to reach rm1.72 on april 5 before retracing. following the strong rally, ng downgraded his call to hold on may 25 when the price was rm1.58. when it skidded to rm1.38 on oct 17, however, he saw reason to upgrade to buy again with rm1.75 target price. jaks closed at rm1.50 as at dec 20, up 48.5% from the time ng reiterated his buy call with a higher target price. a special mention goes to affins lim yee tang, who initiated coverage on jaks before he moved to equity sales. ng assumed coverage from november 2016.  \nkenanga researchs raymond choos call on hartalega holdings bhd at the start of 2017, kenanga investment researchs raymond choo boldly recommended that clients buy hartalega holdings shares. he was the only one of 20 analysts tracking the stock to do so, according to bloomberg data. in fact, there was as many as five sell calls. the lack of enthusiasm may have stemmed from the fact that hartalega shares were down 17% year on year in 2016 after gaining 72% y-o-y in 2015. a long-time favourite of investors, the leading nitrile glove maker sprang a surprise rebound this year, rising more than120%. the stock moved from rm4.76 as at end-2016 to rm9.75 on dec 15, our award evaluation cut-off date. as at dec 20, the stock price reached rm11.40! investors who bought shares early this year would have choo to thank. his contrarian stance stemmed from the conviction that hartalega was capitalising on its new capacity from the ngc plant in sepang on the back of robust demand and a slower-than-expected production ramp-up in the other rubber glove players. he was convinced by hartalegas constant desire to move up the value chain by offering superior product innovation and automating its production processes. hartalegas recently announced first non-leaching antimicrobial nitrile examination glove is also expected to be a game changer in the rubber glove industry. inter-pacific securities david lai yoon hui also deserves a notable mention for also having a buy for the most part, save for a blip in may.  \nmidf researchs ng bei shans call on superlon holdings bhd at its peak, superlon holdings bhds market capitalisation reached rm463.7 million when its share price rose to rm2.92 on sept 18. while some institutional investors may consider this small, the market cap is already more than double the rm202.47 million the company was valued at on nov 22 last year  the day midf researchs ng bei shan initiated coverage on the maker of synthetic rubber insulators used mainly for heating, ventilation, air conditioning (hvac) and refrigeration  which are important for high-rise buildings and industrial use. the recommendation was based on the prospects for its new warehouse, which would improve lead time and sales; market dominance; and its sturdy balance sheet (rm39.13 million net cash) that spelt dividend payments. in fact, midf had been watching superlon for some months, starting with a non-rated report in march 2016, when its market cap stood at rm159.6 million. measured from nov 21, 2016, the share price appreciated as much as 137% to reach rm2.92 on sept 11 this year. part of the gains were thanks to a share split that the company had hoped would improve liquidity  a move that was rewarded with the entry of institutional investors, including the emergence of kumpulan wang persaraan (diperbadankan) as a substantial shareholder with a 10.49% stake. closing at rm2.15 on dec 15, the counter had skidded 26% from its recent peak but it remains about 75% above the time midf started calling a buy. ng, who had downgraded the stock to neutral on sept 27, when her target price was nearly met and its 1qfy2018 earnings were hit by a spike in raw material price, upgraded her call again to buy on dec 15 following the share price weakness. at the time of writing, its rm2.36 target price implies 9.8% upside potential from current levels.  \naffin hwang capital researchs tan jian yuans call on serba dinamik holdings bhd if you had bought serba dinamik holdings bhd shares when affin hwang researchs tan jian yuan started coverage with a buy and rm2.40 target price, you would have seen your holdings rise 67.7% over seven months from rm1.76 to rm3.22 on dec 15. thats if you did not get the initial public offering (ipo) shares for serba dinamik, which made a strong debut on the main market on feb 8 this year and went on to become the years best-performing ipo with a gain of 119% as at dec 15. kenanga investment bank was the ipo lead manager. when tan started tracking serba dinamik about two months from its debut, the stock price had already appreciated 10% from its ipo price. yet he was convinced that there was at least 45% more upside potential  and was proved right. at the time, tan was upbeat on its growth potential, expecting strong maintenance activity growth and expansion of engineering, procurement, construction and contracting (epcc) revenue to drive forward earnings. he also expected the group to pay out 25% to 30% of net profits in fy2017 to fy2019, translating into decent yields of3.3% to 5.2%, the initiation report read. a notable mention goes to rhb research institutes wan mohd zahidi, who initiated coverage on may 8 with a rm2.78 target price when the stock price was at rm1.92, as well as alliance dbs researchs inani rozidin, who initiated coverage on may 16 this year with a rm2.90 target price when the stock was at rm2. investors would also have made good money following their recommendations, despite the later initiation dates. at the time of writing, tans rm4 target price shows that he remains among the most bullish of all seven analysts calling a buy while rhbs is the lowest at rm3.10 "}, "6": {"date_posted": "4/1/2018", "title": "pre-election rally may be getting started", "article": " kuala lumpur: malaysias stock market showed first signs of the much-anticipated pre-election rally yesterday, as market breadth turned bullish with 771 stocks advanced compared with 305 declines. trading volume surpassed five billion shares for the first time since march last year, with 5.11 billion shares worth rm3.68 billion traded yesterday compared with tuesdays 3.7 billion shares worth rm2.11 billion. this has prompted some analysts to suggest a pre-election rally could be at play. stocks likely to benefit in the run-up to the 14th general election (ge14) also moved to the upside yesterday. shares in malaysian resources corp bhd (mrcb) climbed 7.8% to rm1.25, while drb-hicom bhd traded up 1.8% to rm2.30. my eg services bhd (myeg) gained more than 10% to rm2.46, and was among the top gainers. umw oil & gas corp bhd shares rose 1.5% to 33 sen, while kub malaysia bhd added 3.5% to 44.5 sen and felda global ventures holdings bhd (fgv) shares were up 3.3% at rm1.86. the stock market is showing a very positive trend upwards as volume hit 5.1 billion shares, while close to 800 counters were in positive territory. it is likely the momentum is in anticipation of the countrys general election [taking place] in the first half of this year, hong leong investment bank head of retail research loui low told the edge financial daily on the phone yesterday. this means the dissolution of parliament is likely to happen in february. historically, the malaysian equity market would see a rally before parliament is dissolved. maybank investment bank head of research wong chew hann said there could be a combination of factors contributing to yesterdays strong market performance, noting that regional markets were also on an uptrend. foreign investors have also turned net buyers recently, favourable to the equity market, she told the edge financial daily. in maybank kim eng researchs regional research report dated jan 2, wong is expecting a period of volatility in equities and the ringgit in the run-up to, and post polling day, with a sizeable political newsflow possibly having an impact on investors sentiments. assuming parliament is dissolved just after the chinese new year (feb 16 and 17), we could potentially see higher activity in equities from january to [the] ge14 and some trading opportunities may manifest. our end-2018 fbm klci target of 1,840 points is based on 15.6 times 12-month forward earnings, she added. affin hwang asset management director of equity strategies and advisory gan eng peng pointed out yesterdays spike in the stock market was initially seen on a few politically-linked counters such as mrcb, drb-hicom and fgv, which quickly spread to the rest of the market. retail participation was much higher than normal. this is probably the early stages of a second-tier rally. we expect active rotation among the names at high volume and this is a trading market, gan said via a text message. cimb investment bank head of malaysia research ivy ng also opines that yesterdays strong market performance signals the start of the pre-election rally. the strong klci performance could be due to the january effect and [the] pre-ge14 rally as a special barisan nasional (bn) supreme council meeting will be held today (yesterday) to discuss the preparations for ge14. january is historically a good month for bursa malaysia and historically, it has chalked up a gain of 1.9% month-on-month over the past 40 years, ng told the edge financial daily via an email. rakuten trade sdn bhd vice-president of research vincent lau concurs. this could be the beginning of the much anticipated pre-election rally. there was [a] news report talking about a special bn supreme council meeting on the preparations for the upcoming election. most investors probably didnt want to miss out on the rally and the positive sentiment eventually spilled over to the broader market. if you look at companies such as kub, fgv, myeg and mrcb, most of them are starting to pick up. i think this is just the start of the anticipated pre-election rally and there are still legs for the market to go further, lau said on the phone. he also opines that the current market provides a good opportunity for investors to trade, with the klci on track to breach the 1,800-point level. the klci closed up 10.09 points or 0.57% at 1,792.79 yesterday. however, inter-pacific securities sdn bhd head of research pong teng siew believes the stock market rally is not sustainable, recommending investors to take profit now as trading volume hovers above five billion shares. the last time we saw volume traded over six billion shares was in march last year. so, if the market continues to see higher volume in the near term, it is better to take profit and by the end of the month, you should have taken all the profit that you can, he said. rather, pong reckons yesterdays strong market performance was the result of continuous stimulus programmes by central banks worldwide except that in the us. the [global] market was very unnatural today (yesterday). practically everywhere is going through an upswing cycle including in malaysia due to the stimulus programme from central banks around the world. markets are awashed with money; investors are reacting the only way they can  being bullish, he said. pong opines that the market is overbought despite the good economic indicators in the country, as they did not translate into better corporate earnings during the third quarter ended sept 30, 2017. he also noted that cost escalation was obvious for malaysian companies as observed from the quarterly results. a fund manager with a local asset management reckons local institutional funds will gradually take profit as the election date draws closer. this (strong market performance) was obviously the beginning of the pre-election rally. we could take advantage of the rally by taking some profits as we approach the election. while it appears that the incumbents are on a stronger footing now, the risk of an unprecedented victory by the opposition at the ballot box has not been priced in. there will be a knee-jerk reaction if that happens, and we dont want to be caught off guard. i think when parliament is dissolved, foreign investors could turn net sellers or stay on the sidelines, he said."}, "7": {"date_posted": "3/1/2018", "title": "capital: broker write - eyeing pockets of opportunity ahead", "article": " by kenny yee head of research, rakuten trade bursa malaysia has had a jekyll and hyde performance this year. the fbm klci touched a high of 1,796.75 points before retreating to the current levels, amid subdued participation from foreign investors. at the height of the local bourses performance, total inflow of foreign funds surpassed the rm12 billion mark but the amount has dwindled to rm10.2 billion currently. nonetheless, following the rather severe foreign outflow in august, september and october, we noticed that foreign participation gathered momentum in december  foreign inflow passed the rm800 million threshold, and counting, at the time of writing. thus, we expect the malaysian stock market to experience improved trading activities in the first quarter of next year in the run-up to the general election. the recently released corporate results for 3q2017 were unexciting, hence the more conservative stance adopted by the research fraternity. despite the prevailing lacklustre performance of bursa malaysia, we believe interest will return when the realignment of portfolios takes place, thus we maintain our positive stance on the benchmark index. we remain staunch advocates of a stronger ringgit as the currency is still the most undervalued in the region. it has the closest correlation to the renminbi/us dollar movements, and we reckon this could only be positive for the ringgit going forward as the renminbi is set to gain its momentum vis-u00e0-vis the us dollar. we see the ringgit re-testing 4.00 against the us dollar and thereafter, to around the 3.80 level. our main concern over the local bourse would be the bubble on wall street, which may derail investors confidence, especially during the quantitative tightening. as for next year, we see pockets of opportunities in the local bourse. we expect the strengthening of the ringgit to be an important catalyst as foreign funds may consider this as a strong pull factor to preserve their investments in the country. it is interesting that the ringgit has remained steadfast over the last few months despite the weakness in the domestic equity market. foreign funds had liquidated their equity positions for the august to october period  totalling rm1.6 billion of foreign outflows. notwithstanding this, we believe foreign monies are staying put in the domestic financial system and are expected to return to the equity market anytime soon. additionally, we may see fresh foreign funds entering the country as the local asset class offers more stability compared with others in the region  we have underperformed the region. we reckon foreign participation will heighten since the valuation of the fbm klci is deemed attractive compared with its regional peers. thus, we expect the fbm klci to chart above 1,900 next year, with our target of 1,910 premised on a market valuation of 16 times and corporate earnings growth of 6.6%, supported by the banking sector that is projected to see earnings expand 8.3% next year. as seen in the table, the fbm klcis valuations are still at reasonable levels  the index is trading below its five-year average while the rest, except for singapore, are currently above or on a par with their respective five-year average per. meanwhile, from a macro perspective, brent crude has improved to above us$63  an 11% improvement from the start of the year. this is a positive sign for the budget 2018 as it was tabled based on crude prices of us$52 a barrel. this provides the government with some buffer when administering its expenditure going forward, without putting pressure on the fiscal deficit. for 2018, private consumption and construction activities, which are envisaged to grow at 7.5% and 6.8% respectively, are expected to be the main impetus to drive domestic economic activities. as for the performance of the sectors, even though there are no obvious outperformers, we favour the banking, construction and consumer sectors. banks: despite the outlook being clouded by concerns over mfrs9 on potential higher credit costs, loan growth is expected to be decent and is projected to grow 4% to 5% next year, spearheaded by household loans. we expect corporate loans/financing to moderate next year with corporates opting for the debt market for financing to mitigate the impact of higher interest rates. we still see good value propositions from affin holdings bhd, cimb group holdings bhd, hong leong bank bhd, rhb bank bhd and malayan banking bhd. construction: we expect construction news flow to improve in cy2018, predominantly from high-profile mega projects, namely the pan borneo highway and east coast rail line (ecrl). the ecrl (rm55 billion) has been pushed into the limelight after the release of budget 2018  the project is to be carried out next year. other transport-related projects such as the mass rapid transit line 2 (rm32 billion), light rail transit line 3 (rm9 billion) and kuala lumpur-singapore high speed rail (rm50 billion to rm60 billion) will also be in focus next year. we reckon recent market weakness presents an excellent opportunity for an accumulation exercise and we prefer the likes of advancecon holdings bhd, ahmad zaki resources bhd, gamuda bhd, hss engineers bhd, ijm corp bhd and kerjaya prospek group bhd. consumer: the retail sub-segment is expected to experience some improvement next year on the back of a 1% reduction in personal income tax. though the impact may be muted, we reckon the marginal improvement in disposable income will lead to more demand for household necessities. meanwhile, the stronger ringgit may play a part in terms of cheaper imports, hence potential margins expansion, particularly for players with a high import content. our picks within this sector include fraser & neave holdings bhd, bison consolidated bhd, 7-eleven malaysia holdings bhd and power root bhd. in view of the possible improvement in trading participation going forward, we believe interest in the small/mid-cap space will follow suit accordingly, buoyed by the pickup in liquidity in the local bourse. thus, for those seeking the alpha-play, we advocate that they look at fundamentally sound smaller-cap companies such as advancecon, azrb, hss, kelington group bhd, kub malaysia bhd, perak transit bhd and straits inter logistics bhd, which are looking attractive following recent price weaknesses. for those keen on the bigger caps, we like british american tobacco (m) bhd, lotte chemical titan holding bhd, petronas gas bhd and tenaga nasional bhd. "}, "8": {"date_posted": "2/1/2018", "title": "best privatisation: century bonds minorities get the elusive fair deal", "article": " this year, the soft stock market prompted a number of privatisations  some were successful, some were not. as the offeror  or offerors as the case may be  often attempt to take companies private at the lowest price possible, it is not surprising that many of the deals were deemed not fair by independent advisers, even if the prices were reasonable. this was one reason, at least, that made kumpulan perangsang selangor bhds (kps) privatisation of century bond bhd the privatisation of the year. at the time, century bond was a paper packaging manufacturer and a leader in cement packaging with a 60% market share. the deal, which was led by cimb investment bank bhd, was concluded on jan 18 when century bond was delisted after it was taken private by kps wholly-owned subsidiary, perangsang packaging sdn bhd. the deal, completed at the end of last year, did not create meaningful synergistic value for the acquirer. after all, kps had minimal operations in the sector and perangsang packaging itself was merely set up for the purpose of undertaking the rm194 million acquisition. instead, kps used the deal to put its balance sheet to work. channel checks reveal that the privatisation was largely funded by debt that kps was able to secure at highly competitive rates. couple that with century bonds stable earnings and strong operational cash flow that branded the company a cash cow asset and kps was set to make a modest spread from the acquisition. it fact, it is learnt that century bonds management is still relatively intact, ensuring that it will be business as usual at the company. looking back, the privatisation took place in two stages. it began on aug 11, 2016, when perangsang packaging made a bid to buy 85.73 million shares representing 71.44% equity interest from century bonds controlling shareholders-cum-managers  the tan family. once the shares were acquired, kps extended a mandatory general offer to all other shareholders at the same price of rm1.75 per share. the offer was deemed both fair and reasonable, according to a report by independent adviser public investment bank bhd. compared with the companys three-month volume weighted average price (vwap) leading up to the initial announcement to acquire the 71.44% stake, the rm1.75 offer came at an 8.02% premium. against the six-month vwap, the offer was at a 12.18% premium. while the premium may seem relatively narrow to privatise a company, it is important to note that century bonds share price enjoyed a relatively strong rally in 2016, prior to the initial offer by perangsang packaging. while the premium itself was not exceptional, the offer was relatively compelling from a valuation perspective. the independent advisers valued the firm based on enterprise value against earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ev/ebitda). at rm1.75 a share, century bond was valued at six times ev/ebitda. this was comparable to valuations of its peers, noted the independent advisers. muda holdings bhd, which had a market capitalisation of rm497.23 million compared with century bonds rm208.8 million, was valued at 7.87 times ev/ebitda. its smaller peer, box-pak (malaysia) bhd, with a market capitalisation of rm121.25 million, was valued at 5.89 times ev/ebitda. another peer, ornapaper bhd, with a market capitalisation of rm69.7 million, was valued at 4.48 times ev/ebitda. it should also be noted that century bond had been profitable in the five business years prior to the acquisition. of course, it can be argued that century bond managed to command favourable valuations overall because perangsang packaging had to buy the 71.44% block from the controlling shareholders in the first place, so the minorities simply got to enjoy the same pricing. in contrast, the other privatisations this year involved controlling shareholders taking their own companies private. one such example was the privatisation of wing tai malaysia bhd by controlling shareholder and management, wing tai investment & development pte ltd. the deal was advised by maybank investment bank bhd. the offeror took wing tai private at rm1.80 a share, almost 49% lower than its fair value per share of rm3.55 to rm3.59, as estimated by mercury securities, the independent adviser. thus, the offer was considered not fair. however, mercury securities added that the offer was reasonable and that this reasonable aspect outweighed its not fair view. after all, the offer price of rm1.80 was 61.75% higher than the one-year vwap, argued mercury securities. that said, it is important to note that wing tais share price had been on the decline for almost two years prior to the offer. another example of a privatisation that was not fair was that of hwang capital (malaysia) bhd by the hwang family, led by hwang lip teik. the privatisation had been expected ever since the companys asset management business was sold in 2014. but after the first offer of rm2.65 per share  made in late-may 2016  failed to go through, the offerors raised the offer price to rm2.94 per share. the deal was advised by affin hwang investment bank bhd. while the second offer ultimately succeeded, it was still seen as not fair by independent adviser rhb investment bank bhd. this was because the offer came at a 14% discount to the revised net asset value of the company, which was determined to be rm3.42 per share. however, given that the offer came at a 12.64% premium to the three-month vwap and there was no competing offer, the advisers deemed it a reasonable offer. still, it should be noted that hwang capitals shares had been suspended for over nine months since sept 2, 2016, before the revised offer was made on june 30, 2017. "}, "9": {"date_posted": "2/1/2018", "title": "best ipo: serba dinamik outperforms despite headwinds", "article": " the share price performance of serba dinamik holdings bhd this year has been stellar, which is remarkable considering it is an energy services group providing engineering solutions to the still-slow oil and gas sector as well as the power generation industry. from the day it debuted on bursa malaysias main market on feb 8, its share price has jumped 106.67% to rm3.10 per share as at dec 21, from the initial public offering price of rm1.50. that makes it the best ipo for 2017. affin hwang investment bank bhd and rhb investment bank bhd were the joint principal advisers and joint bookrunners. both institutions were joint underwriters for the deal, together with aminvestment bank bhd and kenanga investment bank bhd. rhb ib was also the managing underwriter. serba dinamiks business activities comprise operations and maintenance services (o&m), engineering, procurement, construction and commission (epcc), and other products and services in o&g and power generation. its o&m business involves maintenance, repair and overhaul (mro) of rotating equipment and inspection, as well as repair and maintenance (irm) of static equipment and structures. the company is ranked third and fifth in malaysia for mro and irm respectively in the o&g industry. the ipo offered a base size of 389.4 million shares at rm1.50 per share, or rm581.4 million, representing 29.2% of the companys enlarged share base, with an over-allotment option of 58.4 million shares or rm87.6 million. serba dinamik raised rm671.7 million, valuing the group at rm2 billion. at the time, it was touted as the biggest ipo in malaysia in 19 months in terms of value, before eco world international bhds listing in april. the ipo proceeds were used primarily for capital expenditure, with the balance going for debt repayment and working capital. the promoters of serba dinamik were datuk mohd abdul karim abdullah, datuk awang daud awang putera and abdul kadier sahib, who collectively owned 83.93% of the groups share base prior to the ipo. post-ipo, serba dinamiks largest shareholder is karim with a 25.27% stake followed by kadier with 20.77%, while daud awang owns 11.7%. kumpulan wang persaraan has a 5.78% stake as at dec 20, and the employees provident fund (epf) holds 5.3%. serba dinamiks ipo is especially noteworthy since it was launched in a volatile global environment when equity markets were affected by chinas slowdown, brexit and falling commodity prices, among other factors. oil prices that remained depressed longer than expected made marketing the exercise even more challenging. despite the headwinds, the listing was successfully executed within the timeline, and priced at the top of the rm1.30 and rm1.50 per share indicative price range. since then, the stock has benefitted from rising oil prices over the last 12 months. the production quotas set by the organisation of petroleum exporting countries and russia have boosted the crude oil price to more than us$60 per barrel, from us$45, in the past six months. a month after its debut, the stock closed at rm1.75, up 17% over its final ipo price. by nov 24, it had almost doubled to rm2.92. serba dinamiks slew of contract wins  totalling rm2.5 billion as at nov 30  which raised its outstanding order book to rm5.3 billion  was another major factor that boosted its share price. o&m jobs made up rm4 billion of total orders, with the remaining rm1.3 billion from epcc contracts. another listing that deserves notable mention is the april 3 debut of eco world international (ewi), which combined the joint expertise of eco world development group bhd  one of malaysias largest publicly listed property developers  and guoco group, which is among southeast asias biggest corporations. guoco group, through its unit guocoland ltd, took up 27% stake in ewi to become a strategic investor in the international arm of tan sri liew kee sins property development business. guoco group is controlled by tan sri quek leng chan. analysts and investors believe the partnership between liew and quek will turn ewi into a formidable property development player in asia. ewi has projects in australia and the uk while guocoland is an established brand in malaysia, singapore, china and vietnam. ewi raised rm2.58 billion by issuing 2.153 billion shares or 89.7% of the groups issued and paid-up capital, as well as a bonus issue of 960 million free warrants on the basis of two warrants for every five shares held by ewi shareholders. ewis ipo was a landmark deal in both malaysia and southeast asia at the time  it was the largest local ipo since june 2015 (before lotte chemical titan holdings bhds ipo later in the year in july, which raised rm3.77 billion), and the largest for a property developer in the region since november 2010, according to maybank investment bank bhd. maybank ib, cimb investment bank bhd and hong leong investment bank (hlib) were the joint principal advisers and joint managing underwriters for the deal. they also acted as joint bookrunners, together with uob kayhian securities (m) sdn bhd. maybank ib, cimb ib, hlib, alliance investment bank bhd, aminvestment bank and rhb ib were the joint underwriters. besides guoco group, the listing also saw permodalan nasional bhd, kumpulan wang persaraan and employees provident fund becoming cornerstone investors of ewi, taking up an aggregate 212.4 million shares, or 8.9% of the enlarged share capital. securing the countrys top public fund managers anchored the transaction and provided significant momentum for the ipo. within nine working days of the bookbuilding, it was 8.9 times oversubscribed. the offering was a resounding success, with the institutional tranche circa 9 times covered at the top end with no sensitivity across the price range, while demand for the retail tranche available to malaysian public was circa 9 times oversubscribed, says maybank ib. after the ipo, ecoworld remains the largest shareholder of ewi with a 30.28% stake while liew owns a direct stake of 10.27%."}, "10": {"date_posted": "2/1/2018", "title": "top 10 stock picks for 2018", "article": " the edge financial dailys picks are based on some of the investment themes that fund managers are exploring in 2018. these themes include the turnaround of the badly hit oil and gas industry where many companies share prices have tumbled to all-time lows; better corporate earnings growth amid a synchronised global economy recovery; interest rate hikes globally; and a strengthening ringgit. meanwhile, the e-commence boom that leads to stronger demand for logistics services and improved consumer sentiments that will boost private consumption could also be the buying impetus that drives investors interests. we did not make a selection based on the 14th general election theme as most research houses have said the market could return to fundamentals after the election.  1. umw oil & gas corp bhd - bouncing back umw oil & gas corp bhd (umw o&g) could turn around in 2018 as its earnings recovery is on sight. the countrys biggest jack-up rig operator has returned to the black in the third financial quarter ended sept 30, 2017 (3qfy17), with a net profit of rm3.4 million, or 0.16 sen per share, compared to a net loss of rm135.4 million, or 6.26 sen per share. umw o&g has seen its fleet utilisation improve from a dismal average of 21% in the 1qfy16 to 68% and 90% in 2qfy17 and 3qfy17 respectively. according to ta securities analyst abel goon, umw o&gs management expects the utilisation rate to be greater than 90% in 4qfy17, while fy18 will realise at least 80% utilisation rate. for umw o&g, one of the key risks is the idling costs incurred. with the utilisation rate now back to about 90% level, the company should see a turnaround in 2018. although the rates remain at a fairly low level, the company would turn profitable if the management could maintain the utilisation rate, goon told the edge financial daily over a phone call. he added that umw o&g should be able to secure more drilling contracts from petroliam nasional bhds (petronas) prioritising local content. based on umw o&g managements feedback, goon pointed that petronas requires at least 12 rigs in malaysia for fy18. umw o&g currently has seven premium jack-up rigs generating 99% of the groups revenue. further, it is on a stronger financial footing after the completion of rm1.8 billion rights issue. umw o&g has guided that a one-time write-off of unamortised transaction costs plus potential asset impairment loss arising from a year-end review in 4qfy17 could weigh on its annual earnings for the financial year ended dec 31, 2017 (fy17). goon reckons the market has priced in a large impairment in 4qfy17, which is why the share price remains at a subdued level. at the current price, umw o&g is trading at about 0.5 times its book value, one standard deviation below its historical average, despite the expected turnaround in its operations, alleviations of short-term liquidity risks and upwards trajectory seen in oil prices. ta securities has set a target price of 51 sen a share, indicating a potential upside of 67.2% from its closing price of 30.1 sen last friday. nonetheless, there remains downside risks for o&g players, especially if the crude oil price sees another sharp decline, which could lead to low utilisation rate. the higher-than-expected finance costs, despite the reduction in borrowings, could also hurt umw o&g, which has a relatively high gearing level.  by billy toh  2. inari amertron bhd - riding on continuous firm demand inari amertron bhd, one of the edge financial dailys stock picks for 2017, is also one of the top performers for the year on bursa malaysia. it remains as one of our stock picks amid expectations that demand for radio frequency (rf) filters to stay strong despite saturating growth in the global smartphone market. affin hwang analyst kevin low told the edge financial daily that demand is driven by the increase in bandwidths and complexity in expanding the long-term evolution coverage, and that demand for rf will likely remain robust. also, inaris customer, broadcom, is a major player in this space. the number of inaris rf testers grew to 960 units and was projected to reach 1,000 units by end-2017. this had far exceeded our assumptions for fy18 (ending june 30, 2018) to fy20, as we had only expected the 1,000-unit mark to be hit by fy20, low said, adding that the iris ir chip could be inaris new earnings driver. inari achieved a net profit growth of 42.4% in the first financial quarter ended sept 30, 2017 (1qfy17) to rm68.4 million, from rm48 million in the previous corresponding quarter, mainly due to increased demand for its existing and new products which came on stream during the past two quarters. the positive outlook is also supported by the upward forecast revision on global semiconductor sales by world semiconductor trade statistics, which raised its forecast to an annual growth of 20.6% in 2017 and 7% in 2018. similarly, other market researchers such as gartner inc and ic insights have revised their forecasts upwards on the semiconductor industry due to exceptional growth in the memory device market. inaris share price, which closed at rm3.40 last friday, has exceeded the average 12-month target price of rm3.09 by analysts based on data compiled by bloomberg. despite the optimism on demand, the slowdown in global demand for smart devices, loss of customer base, and the introduction of new technologies may render inaris products obsolete and could dampen its earnings prospects. investors should also pay heed to a recent report on the forecasts cut on apples iphone x shipment by analysts citing tepid demand. in the last five years, inaris investors would have seen an annualise gain of 101.3%. at the current level, the stock is trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio (p/e) of 27 times compared with apple incs 18 times. despite the downside risks, inari has a proven track record with a good management and is a leading rf test house in asia, which fit into our selections.  by billy toh  3. berjaya food bhd - extra shots from starbucks berjaya food bhd (bfood) is expected to see its earnings growth moving forward supported by starbucks due to its store expansion and recovery in same-store sales growth (sssg). the company will also benefit from a strong ringgit, which will help to expand its profit margin, as up to 50% of its materials are imported. according to the groups latest financial results, bfoods net profit grew 15.5% to rm5.8 million in the second financial quarter ended oct 30, 2017 (2qfy18) from rm5 million a year ago, thanks to higher profit recorded by starbucks operations in malaysia and lower losses incurred by kenny rogers roasters (krr) operations in indonesia arising from further closure of non-performing outlets. rhb research analyst soong wei siang told the edge financial daily that bfoods management is looking to turn around krr malaysia in fy18 and had implemented changes such as introducing a new menu and moderating the prices of dishes served. he said bfoods management also aims to improve service standards at krr malaysia to the level of starbucks. in previous quarters, bfoods earnings were dragged down by krrs operations. with a potential turnaround at krr malaysia and the starbucks-driven growth, soong said this provides a two-pronged avenue to spur earnings growth. the recent disposal of krr indonesia is earnings-accretive, and we believe it would continue to lift sentiments on the stock, he said. nonetheless, bfood is currently trading at a lofty valuation. at its closing price of rm1.85 last friday, bfood is trading at a trailing p/e of 55 times. in comparison, starbucks corp, listed in the us, is only trading at a trailing p/e of 26 times. the downside risks at the current price include a lower-than-expected sssg growth and rising operating costs.  by billy toh  4. straits inter logistics bhd - bunkering services fuel growth the company seems to have gained a new lease of life. its net profit jumped 63 times to rm631,000 in the latest third financial quarter ended sept 30, 2017 (3qfy17) from rm10,000 in 3qfy16, while its revenue grew 63.4% to rm33 million from rm20.2 million during the same period. it has secured a rm45 million bunkering services contract which will provide more stable revenue and wider margins compared with its oil trading operation. according to rakuten trade sdn bhd head of research kenny yee, straits inter logistics is the only listed bunkering company on bursa. bunkering is basically a floating petrol station for sea dwelling vessels. i think that while 3qfy17 shows a marked improvement, straits inter logistics future earnings and prospect are bright. currently, the trading and supply of oil products has been the main revenue contributor and the company is expected to move up the value chain with the acquisition of two bunkering vessels with a combined capacity of one million litres of premium oil, yee said. the two bunkering vessels are docked at pasir gudang, johor and labuan, according to yee, and he pointed out the bunkering operations from the pasir gudang port had only commenced in 4qfy17, indicating better results in the quarter. in august last year, straits inter logistics, formerly known as raya international bhd, unveiled a new corporate brand identity to reflect its new business direction, as a major marine logistics company providing premium oil bunkering services to marine and cargo bulk transporters, o&g vessels, floating production storage and offloading vessels, cruise ships and ferries. under new managing director datuk seri ho kam choy, who replaced datuk tan seng hu, and with a healthy balance sheet with net cash of rm16.5 million arising from a completed rights issue exercise, straits inter logistics is in a good position to expand its bunkering business. with its share price leaping 94% in 2017, straits inter logistics is trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio of 34.3 times; however, as earnings visibility improves with the start of its pasir gudang bunkering operations, the companys earnings are expected to catch up with the valuation. yee has a target price of 31 sen a share for straits inter logistics, indicating a potential upside of 19.2%.  by billy toh  5. serba dinamik holdings bhd - record high order book less than a year after its listing on bursa, serba dinamik holdings bhd shares more than doubled to end 2017 at rm3.24, versus its initial public offering price of rm1.50. it has a market capitalisation of rm4.33 billion. despite the volatility in crude oil prices leaving most of malaysias o&g players beleaguered, the company has seen earnings rise year-on-year. its net profit jumped nearly four times to rm229.5 million in the first nine months of 2017 due to improved contributions from its operations and maintenance as well as engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning services. serba dinamik, providing engineering solutions to o&g and power generation industries, is expected to benefit from a sector-wide recovery as oil prices stabilise, said publicinvest research deputy head of research ching weng jin. affin hwang capital research has raised its target price for the stock to rm4 from rm3.60, touting serba dinamiks rm4 billion order book target for the latest financial year ending dec 31, 2018 (fy18) as conservative as the company is expected to expand its asset ownership. an all-time high order book of rm5.3 billion should drive better earnings growth in the financial year ending dec 31, 2018, said the research house in a dec 13 note. it is screaming buy on the stock among analysts who track it, with consensus 12-month target price of rm3.61, according to bloomberg data.  by samantha ho  6. cimb group holdings bhd - in calmer waters an interest rate hike and improved loan growth amid stronger economic growth augur well for the banking sector in 2018. cimb group holdings bhd may benefit from healthier capital market activities going forward, according to ta securities. analysts opine that better growth prospects across its indonesian and thai operations are also likely to support earnings. while we forecast the overall credit charge to remain elevated, we believe the worst, in terms of asset quality, may be over, ta securities analyst li hsia wong wrote in the research firms annual strategy report. credit costs for cimb improved to 73 basis points in the third quarter ended sept 30, 2017 from 78 basis points a year ago, despite a 9% quarter-on-quarter increase in absolute gross impaired loans. also in its annual strategy report, ta securities highlights cimb is trading at an attractive price-book value of 1.12 times compared with an industry average of 1.15 times with its large market capitalisation at peers average of 1.5 times. having rallied to a one-year high of rm7.08 at end-august last year, the share price retraced to rm6.54 last friday. it has a market value of rm60.34 billion. the group commands 18 buy calls, four holds and two sells, according to bloomberg data. out of 24 analysts, 21 have a consensus 12-month target price of rm6.87 a share.  by samantha ho  7. muhibbah engineering (m) bhd - contract wins to buoy muhibbah new contract wins and positive prospects in the construction, o&g, marine and aviation sectors are expected to continue driving earnings at muhibbah engineering (m) bhd, which provides engineering and construction services. the group recently secured a rm70 million contract to build a reinforced concrete jetty and platform from tenaga nasional bhd, as well as a rm189 million work package for the mass rail transit 2. this brings its total order book to rm2.7 billion so far. according to midf research head of research mohd redza abdul rahman, muhibbah is among the companies expected to benefit as an exporter of services and commodities. the group is expected to benefit from its exposure to qatar and the tripling of its capacity there, mohd redza told the edge financial daily, noting the blockade on qatar by other gulf countries is unlikely to hamper the group. additionally, the group is expected to gain from higher aviation activity, with recurring income

last week following the governments decision to fork out rm929 million to subsidise electricity tariff for the first six months of 2018 and also to keep the base tariff at 38.53 sen/kwh until 2020. pending the release of regulatory period 2 (rp2) input details, most research houses have maintained their earnings forecasts and target prices for tnb. maybank ib research, in its latest research note dated dec 27, said every 0.5 percentage point lower weighted average cost of capital from 2018 impacts the research houses target by rm1.30, barring any unforeseen circumstances. we see room for tenaga to rerate as doubts over the pass-through mechanism eventually dissipate, said maybank ib research. tenaga is seen as a liquid proxy to gdp (gross domestic product) growth, midf researchs mohd redza told the edge financial daily on a phone call, adding the utility firm is likely to benefit from an expected economic expansion in 2018. he also pointed out the counter is among the stocks with a high trading velocity due to a strong following among local and foreign funds. over the past one year, the stock grew about 14.41% to rm15.26 last friday. according to bloomberg, of the 25 analysts covering the company, 20 of them have a buy call on the stock, four holds and one sell.  by wong ee lin  9. tasco bhd - clientele diversification the key driver tasco bhd has been strengthening its foothold in the logistics industry through diversifying its clientele and moving up the value chain by providing full-fledge logistics solutions to customers. going into 2018, analysts are sanguine on its future growth following its venture into the cold chain market. it took over gold cold transport sdn bhd, one of the largest cold chain logistics players in malaysia, and mils cold chain sdn bhd last year. midf research analyst adam mohamed rahim said the contribution from this segment, which started in the second quarter ended sept 30, 2017 (2qfy18), is expected to increase moving forward. adam added that tascos regional distribution centre in the digital free trade zone for renesas, one of the worlds largest producers of microcontrollers and microprocessors, is also one of the main drivers for tascos bright outlook in 2018. additionally, he noted that tasco has entered into a shareholder agreement with yee lee corp bhds wholly-owned subsidiary yee lee trading co sdn bhd, expected to provide expansion opportunities for tasco, enabling the logistics player to access new markets and distribution networks. on whether it is now a good time for investors to buy the stock, adam reckons so, explaining that tasco is currently trading at a p/e of 14 times  reasonable compared with most of its peers with a p/e of below 10 times and 20 times. over the past year, the stock has rallied 41.5% to close at rm2.08 in 2017. analysts target price is between rm2.55 and rm2.69, according to bloomberg data.  by wong ee lin  10. mkh - young trees to boost yield mkh bhd, having made its foray into the oil palm plantation business 10 years ago, sees most of its oil palm trees reaching prime age in 2017 and 2018. with the expectation of better fresh fruit bunch (ffb) production to improve in the next few years, the plantation division is expected to sustain strong earnings growth and contribution to the groups bottom line. mkhs share price fell nearly 68% to rm1.63 in 2017 after its net profit for the financial year ended sept 30, 2017 (fy17) declined 36.37% to rm130.48 million from rm205.04 million, mainly due to the absence on a net project grant worth rm11.7 million from the government and lower sales revenue. at the current level, mkh is trading at a trailing p/e of 5.8 times. in comparison, mkh trades at an average historical p/e of 9.5 times in the last five years. according to ta securities analyst steven soo, mkhs share price has bottomed to a reasonable price level. hence, he opines that the stock should recover in the second half of 2018. with expectations of the cpo price at a sustainable level above rm2,300 and the attractive valuation that mkh offers, the edge financial daily has selected mkh as one of the stock picks for 2018. mkhs exposure to the property and construction segment could also see a turnaround with its launches in kajang 2 if sales exceed expectations. mkh has deferred property launches on its prime land in kajang and semenyih over the past two years as it awaited the completion of key infrastructures such as the rm62 million flyover in kajang 2, and the sungai buloh-kajang mass rail transit line which has been operational since july 2017, according to alliancedbs researchs research report dated nov 29. the research house noted the stronger-than-expected sales from launches in kajang 2 could be a re-rating catalyst. nevertheless, the key risks alliancedbs pointed out is that mkh may face margin compression due to rising construction cost for property projects as well as exposure to fluctuations in crude palm oil prices which in turn could increase earnings volatility.  by wong ee lin"}, "11": {"date_posted": "2/1/2018", "title": "factors that swing the market", "article": " as we usher in the new year after the benchmark fbm klci closing in the positive zone in 2017  the first time in three years, many investors would ponder whether the strong momentum could continue into 2018. the following is the list of factors that could possibly swing the market moving forward:  malaysias ge14 the much anticipated 14th general election (ge14) did not materialise in 2017, will definitely take place in 2018 before aug 24 this year as the mandate of the ruling barisan national (bn) coalition will end in june 2018. analysts have in general expects the ge14 to be the main driver of investors sentiment in early 2018 before a return to fundamentals post ge14. so far, most research analysts view that the poll is likely to be in between february and april. the pre-election rally is expected to lift sentiments and improve the feel-good factor, which is important for incumbent governments. the election-play counters, companies that are perceived to have a political favour or have the potential to benefit from a good performance at the ballot box by the incumbents such as utusan melayu (m) bhd, george kent (m) bhd and felda global ventures holdings bhd, to name a few, would draw some interest from traders and investors. of course, just as with everything the upcoming ge14 could also pose a downside risk to the equity market as it might act as a short-term dampener on foreign investors who are wary of political risks. risks to the equity market also include the outcome of the election, especially since most analysts have not priced in the possibility of an unprecedented victory for the opposition. the return of malaysias longest-serving prime minister, tun dr mahathir mohamad, to active politics, has definitely added a new variable into the equation. should the unexpected happen, investors, both local and foreign alike, will most likely have to revisit the drawing board to evaluate the unchartered territory as bn has ruled since independence. this would lead to an immediate knee-jerk reaction to the stock market.  price stability in crude oil the positive outlook and price stability in crude oil are viewed as a positive driver for malaysias economy. the government has factored only a us$52 per barrel crude oil price in its budget 2018s revenue assumption. every addition of us$1 per barrel will add up to rm300 million in governments revenue and narrow the deficit by two basis points, according to ta securities. this is positive from a sovereign credit rating perspective, which could also attract foreign investors into both the domestic equity and bond markets in malaysia. the oil and gas companies that are listed on bursa malaysia will also benefit from a stronger and more stable oil price in 2018 after a disappointing performance in the last three years for most of the companies. with most of the impairments being done in previous years, some of these companies might return on investors radar as the oil price continues to make its climb. nonetheless, in petronas report on activity outlook 2018-2020, it highlighted three key factors that are critical for oil prices to gain strength. the first one is the compliance by organization of the petroleum exporting countries (opec) and non-opec countries on the output cut accord. the response from us tight oil players is also key to price recovery. it added that the ability to reduce breakeven cost from collaboration with service providers, especially deployment of innovative technology, has sustained the level of tight oil drilling activities in the us. on the demand side, petronas highlighted that a sustained healthy global demand growth will facilitate oil stock drawdowns and subsequently hasten global oil market rebalancing. ta securities also pointed out that saudi arabias resolve to maintain high crude oil prices may weaken post potential listing of saudi aramco in the second half of 2018. furthermore, a possible fix to us shale players shortcomings in boosting supply, such as storage of hydraulic fracking crew and equipment, could limit the upside for oil prices.  stronger ringgit the ringgit has make its comeback in 2017 and most research houses expect the trend of a firmer ringgit against the us dollar to continue this year. the local currency is viewed to have been oversold given the prolonged losses in 2014 to 2016. the ringgit is undervalued in view of the supportive fundamentals, a more stable oil price, external reserves rebuilding, sustained trade and current account surpluses, progress in fiscal consolidation, receding foreign holding risk in the bond market as well as resumption in the repatriation of export earnings. affin hwang investment bank bhd said in its malaysia strategy 2018 outlook report that typical beneficiaries from a stronger ringgit from an operational perspective includes airlines, auto and media companies on lower operating costs. as for the balance sheet, those with a higher proportion of us dollar-denominated borrowings are also likely to see improvement. the stronger ringgit would have a negative impact on exporters, such as rubber glove players and semiconductor companies but affin hwang noted that the negative currency impact on some of these players would be mitigated by the growth drivers in these sectors.  monetary tightening and unwinding of qe the us has started the ball rolling with its rate hike and unwinding of its quantitative easing (qe). in october last year, the us federal reserve started to unwind its balance sheet, starting at us$10 billion every month and this will rise by us$10 billion each quarter onwards to a maximum of us$50 billion per month. the market is expecting another three rounds of rate hikes in 2018. the latest us tax cuts in 2018 that have just recently been passed will also lead to a stronger us dollar and greater inflation. inflation could rise faster than expected when the higher disposable income from the us$1.4 trillion tax savings over the next decade filters through the economy. the faster-than-expected tightening in the developed markets could also induce volatility in financial markets due to rapid capital outflows from emerging markets such as malaysia. in malaysia, it is also likely that the central bank will follow suit as expectations of a hike in the overnight policy rate (opr) has increased on the back of a strong gross domestic product (gdp) growth in the first three quarters of 2017. the prospect of bank negara malaysia raising the opr will provide a near-term catalyst for the banking sector as banks benefit from an interest rate upcycle as loans are repriced quicker than deposits. of course, the malaysian banking sector could see some impact from the implementation of mfrs9 but research houses, such as affin hwang, do not foresee any material impact on earnings as asset quality remains healthy.  corporate earnings expected to grow corporate earnings among bursa-listed companies had been disappointing considering the strong gdp growth in 2017. moving forward, as global economy continues to show synchronised expansion, investors will need to see improvement in earnings to be convinced. according to maybank investment bank (ib) researchs report on 2018 outlook & lookouts, which was published in mid-december last year, global growth momentum is set to be maintained in 2018, expanding at 3.6%, the same pace as in 2017. maybank ib research expects a 5.3% growth in 2018, with domestic demand to continue as growth driver on the back of continued growth in consumer spending, public consumption and gross fixed capital formation on expansions in both private investment and public investment. maybank ib research has a core earnings growth estimate of 7.9% for 2017 and forecast of 9.7% for 2018 as compared to the no growth years between 2014 and 2016. similarly, ta securities expects earnings growth under its coverage to increase by 6.1% and 7.5% in 2018 and 2019 respectively.  external risks remain being an open economy, malaysia is highly exposed to external risks, such as trade protectionism and economic nasionalism, seen in the us under president donald trump. trump has repeatedly spoke of his intent to rectify persistent trade imbalances and trade barriers with other countries  with china being on top of that list  any trade war or implication of one among the two largest economies in the world will affect the world, including malaysia. the uncertainty revolving brexit as well as rising geopolitical tension between some of the countries could also impact investors sentiment. among the main concerns involving geopolitical tensions are the ongoing feud between the us and north korea, arab saudi and iran. a potential war would put synchronised global economy expansion at a halt."}, "12": {"date_posted": "14/12/2017", "title": "klci to sustain momentum, stay above 1,730-level ", "article": " kuala lumpur

said the market saw buying activity on dec 13 with the benchmark index crossing into the 1,730 zone to reach a high of 1,737.66. it said this suggested that market participants were willing to play a more aggressive buying game. the crossover of 1,730 was indeed encouraging because 1,730 was generally viewed a selling resistance level. the crossover of 1,730 had given certain amount of buying confidence. a closer study of the way this market carried itself on dec 13 revealed that a highly competitive trading activity was taking place in the area of 1,730, it said. the research house said this can be seen from the higher market volume of 2.5 billion shares compared to the average of 18.95 billion shares from nov 30 to dec 12. it said following the up close on dec 13, there should be buying attempt again with immediate hurdle at 1,738. it added that a crossover of 1,738 would see the market moving towards the next resistance at 1,750. the analysis of overall market action on dec

holdings bhd is expecting its timber business to recover despite a double whammy of lower timber export quota and drastic levy hike for hill logs that has dragged the division into the red. as both policy changes took effect on july 1, ta ann started feeling the effects in its third quarter ended sept 30 (3qfy2017). the timber division reported a pre-tax loss of rm5.3 million compared with a pre-tax profit of rm26.09 million in the previous corresponding period. revenue fell from rm152.6 million to rm101.6 million. to recap, the sarawak government reduced its timber export quota from 30% to 20% effective july. before that, in mid-april, it announced a substantial increase in its hill timber premium charge  its first in 31 years  from 80 sen per cu m to rm50. the net effect is on the domestic front, affecting the cost of both logs and plywood manufacturing, therefore squeezing the operators profit margins, ta ann says in a statement in response to questions from the edge. moving forward, ta ann says it hopes to mitigate the impact by passing on the cost via higher prices for both export logs and plywood products, particularly as the quota reduction will restrict the supply of export logs. the impact of the increase in the hill timber premium charge is magnified for the companys plywood business due to a 50% recovery rate. in other words, it takes two cubic metres of raw logs to produce one cubic metre of plywood  a net increase of nearly rm100 per cubic metre produced. ta ann typically transfers its non-exportable logs to downstream operations via inter-company sales at market price. about 50% of its log production involves hill logs. as for its plywood business, the higher cost of raw materials coincided with a lower supply as the timber export quota reduction also means a lower log production quota. up to september, ta anns log output was 195,000 cu m. it was expecting a total output of 350,000 cu m this year. last year, it produced 446,846 cu m, 19.6% of which came from its forest plantation and the rest from timber concessions. these factors pulled down log supply to ta anns plywood mills, affecting utilisation and cost per cubic metre this quarter. to mitigate the higher cost of hill logs, the company is now stepping up log output from its forest plantation, and using tasmanian veneer to make up for the shortfall. we have regularised our position by harvesting more logs from our forest plantation, which doesnt have any cutting restrictions, says ta ann, referring to the states restriction on timber concession logging to trees that are at least 45cm in diameter. the downstream challenges hit the companys overall performance in 3qfy2017. it saw quarterly revenue fall 11.9% year on year to rm308.2 million and net profit decrease 55.6% to rm23.1 million as sales of plywood and export logs declined, down 37% and 55% respectively. in fy2016, plywood made up 34% of ta anns revenue and 4% of its pre-tax profit while logging operations made up 12% and 35% respectively. the sawmill business contributed 2% to revenue and 1% to pre-tax profit. the slowing sales offset the improving performance of ta anns palm oil business, whose pre-tax profit rose 7% year on year to rm54.5 million on a 4.2% growth in revenue to rm205.5 million in 3qfy2017. though timber is ta anns legacy business, it ventured into oil palm soon after its listing in 1999. the latter started contributing to its bottom line in 2006. in fy2016, the palm oil division marked a milestone by contributing the most  52.9%  to the groups turnover for the first time, and accounted for 60% of the pre-tax profit. its total land bank stands at 87,151ha, of which 47.8% or 41.64ha are planted. about 88.4% of the planted area is mature, aged between 4 and 17 years. last year, the palm oil division produced 666,436 tonnes of fresh fruit bunches (ffb)  up 5% year on year  and saw a top yield of 21.06 tonnes per hectare for oil palm aged between seven and nine years. year to date, oil palm has driven the companys performance in 9mfy2017 with crude palm oil and ffb sales growing 11% and 13% respectively. average selling prices also increased 14% and 11% respectively, ta ann says. in the nine-month period to sept 30, the groups cumulative revenue hit rm880.1 million  up 5% year on year  while net profit rose 11% to rm113.7 million. last thursday, ta ann closed at rm3.50  down 8.9% year to date  giving the company a market capitalisation of rm1.56 billion. of the nine analysts tracking the counter, three have recommended a buy and the rest hold while target prices range from rm3.60 to rm4.50. the highest target price is by midf research, which has a buy call on the stock. in a nov 29 report, the research house says it expects the timber business to improve going forward. we expect things to normalise in 4qfy2017 and the division should return to a profitable position. however, maybank investment bank research, in a nov 29 report, says the timber division could see sustained losses in 4qfy2017. it has a hold call on the stock and a target price of rm3.86. looking ahead, ta ann expects stable demand for logs and plywood products in tandem with regional economic growth. it also expects its timber division to ride the olympics games in japan in 2020, which are expected to boost plywood exports and sale prices. it tells the edge that its plywood products have been accepted by the japanese government for infrastructure works ahead of the games. as for export log prices, they went up 5% in the third quarter of 2017 versus the previous quarter. plywood prices have similarly shown an upward trend, says ta ann. given the limited supply base for tropical logs, prices are expected to move upwards steadily with occasional seasonal adjustments."}, "16": {"date_posted": "7/12/2017", "title": "accumulate guocoland on stock price weakness, says maybank kim eng", "article": " singapore (dec 7): maybank kim eng is

is poised for better times in 2018, with corporate earnings ready for a rebound amid better-than-expected economic growth, according to credit suisse. it is not going to be a bull market [for malaysia], but it will be less worse, having been one of the worst-performing markets in asia for the last three years, credit suisse malaysia managing director stephen hagger said. speaking at the rehda institute ceo series 2017 regional property development conference here yesterday, hagger said malaysia, which the global financial services provider had termed the most unloved larger mainstream emerging market, will see earnings growth next year, with upside in the low teens for the fbm klci in 2018. malaysia is the only country in asia with no earnings per share (eps) growth in 2017. we now believe malaysian corporate earnings have bottomed, said hagger. this is on top of corporate restructuring involving some bigger players like sime darby bhd, which is splitting up into three pure-play companies, while malayan banking bhd is planning to create a separate class of syariah shares, said hagger. also hoped to have bottomed out, said hagger, is the global emerging market funds, which are currently underweight on the local market by 70%. global emerging market funds are almost zero-weighted in malaysia and that is a good thing  they have no more to sell. the only thing they can do is do nothing or buy some more, said hagger. credit suisse malaysia is positive on the oil and gas, construction, technology, banks and rubber sectors  while it expects plantation and property sectors to weigh on the market. the market may also pique investor interest next year as political risks are expected to subside after the upcoming election. broadly, markets dont like surprises. and [the] continuation of [the] present administration will be seen as positive for the market, he said. however, the countrys political direction is not seen by hagger as positive for the ringgit in the long term, despite the fact that selling pressure on bonds has eased so far. the currency will be linked to oil, politics u2026 given the direction in politics, the long-term outlook for the ringgit is not good, he said. hagger said the malaysian government could do away with getting involved in businesses to attract foreign investors. if you look at ownership in the stock market, it is mostly owned by government-linked institutions, and that is really bad news, he said. hagger blamed domestic fund inflow as a cause of expensive valuation across the malaysian stock market between 2014 and 2016, which also made the market unattractive. valuation-wise, malaysia has historically been quite expensive, he said. one of the reasons for that is the tremendous exit of foreign holdings, and government-linked funds had no choice but to keep on buying into this market [to keep it stable]. but valuation right now is back at [the] global financial crisis level in terms of price-to-book ratio, so it is not too stretched, said hagger. price-earnings ratio, too, is currently at a historic average, he added. the years 2014 to 2016 saw a bit of a shake-up in the nations political landscape. in that period, rm38.2 billion of domestic institution funds bought into the local stock market, bank negara malaysia data showed. at the same time, rm28.7 billion worth of foreign money exited the country. the trend is now on a reversal this year. to date, foreign inflow stood at rm10.4 billion against rm5.1 billion outflow of domestic institution funds. but foreign investments are very much underweight. inflow was going well since january this year, until the bandar malaysia debacle in may, said hagger. on may 3, finance ministry-owned trx city sdn bhd announced that its agreement with iwc crec sdn bhd for the sale of a 60% stake in bandar malaysia sdn bhd had lapsed, with trx claiming iwc crec failed to meet related payment obligations. that led into question the sanctity of government contracts. that really scared the market, said hagger. really, the role a government should play is that of a regulator. there are a lot of other more little things, but exiting businesses will be an excellent start, he added."}, "23": {"date_posted": "31/10/2017", "title": "hengyuan, petron shares rise on anticipation of hike in petrol pump prices",

we will see the result from the second quarter (ending dec 31). as for the scrapping of the cabotage policy in may, there has been no immediate impact, he says. but whether this will be the case in the longer term remains to be seen, he cautions. the policy, introduced in the 1980s, had limited the shipping of goods between peninsular malaysia and sabah and sarawak to malaysian-flagged vessels.  however, there has been partial liberalisation, allowing some foreign shipping lines such as mtt shipping to call at bintulu port directly. in fy2017, hlgbs revenue fell 11.73% year on year to rm521.5 million while net profit came in at rm26.8 million, down 52.31% year on year and the lowest in four consecutive financial years. it is worth noting that the shipping division contributed 60.1% to the groups revenue, the highest in six years. that helped the division bounce back to profitability after a making a loss in fy2016. pre-tax profit contribution stood at 29.7%, a four-year high. however, the improvement in the shipping division was offset by the slower performance of the logistics services and machinery division, which was dragged down by lower cargo volume and higher operating costs. the division accounted for 63% of the groups pre-tax income in fy2017. meanwhile, hlgbs engineering division slipped into the red due to the completion of projects while newer projects were still at the initial stages. in an aug 29 report, maybank ib research notes that mega infrastructure projects in sarawak, such as the upcoming baleh dam, will drive growth for hlgb on top of the low base in fy2017. the research house expects the companys core net profit to rise from rm22 million to rm31 million by fy2018. it upgraded the stock to a hold with a target price of 71 sen because it feels the counter has seen enough correction. the stock closed at 69.5 sen last thursday  down 15.2% year to date  giving the company a market capitalisation of rm278.28 million. maybank research pegs the fair value of the company at rm304.2 million. yong is more conservative. while he expects earnings to improve in fy2018, he does not see hlgbs financial performance matching that of fy2016, which was boosted by one-off gains at its property arm. in fy2016, net profit came in at rm56.2 million on revenue of rm590.8 million, both at the highest level since the company assumed the listing status of tongkah holdings bhd in 2004. looking ahead, yong expects the logistics division to at least maintain its performance. the division will be completing additional warehousing capacity by january, which will add 1,600 sq m to the existing 9,000 sq m, of which 5,000 sq m is leased. we hope to construct another 10,000 sq m in bintulu, says yong. we may start construction by the end of the current year and it will take about 12 months to complete. he adds that the cost will likely be around rm12 million, which is expected to be generated from 70% financing and 30% internal cash utilisation. as at june 30, 2017, hlgb had a cash pile of rm75.52 million, a current ratio of 2.07 times and gearing ratio of 0.21 times. but given that lower volume dragged down fy2017 revenue in the logistics services and machinery division, is it wise to essentially double the groups warehousing capacity? there is ample cargo to store, says yong, adding that the operation cost is not expected to rise significantly in fy2018. for fy2017, hlgb declared a dividend of 1.5 sen per share subject to shareholders approval in its upcoming annual general meeting. its payout ratio is 22.4%, the highest in four years. maybank research forecasts hlgbs net dividend to hit 2.1 sen in fy2018 and rise over the next two financial years. yong declines to provide the dividend outlook for fy2018 but reiterates the groups policy of paying out about 30% of profits. he expects to maintain that ratio barring unforeseen circumstances.

[the sale] does not imply a change in our view of the prospect of cimb going forward ... its very much an internally mufg/btmu-driven decision. in fact, there will be no change in the status of cimb as one of our alliance partners in asean, she says. in a press release posted on its website on sept 20, mufg says it sold its cimb stake as part of a larger plan to optimise capital management amid tightened international financial regulations and changes in the business environment. in such a context, mufg is conducting a review of existing strategic investments by the mufg group of companies from the viewpoint of strategy, capital efficiency and profitability of investment, among others, it says. nomura research, in a note on mufg, says it views the sale as a positive step in the japanese groups review of its existing investment portfolio, which forms part of its initiatives to improve productivity under the mufg re-imagining strategy, which it unveiled in may. given the size of the sale at over u00a560 billion, we think this move will send a clear message that mufg, as a megabank that has seen its profitability decline under its previous strategy of expansion, is becoming more selective in its portfolio in order to prioritise productivity and investment efficiency, its analyst ken takamiya says. mufg has branches in malaysia, and we think the importance of malaysia and the rest of southeast asia to mufg is unchanged. mufg got the equivalent of about u00a568 billion from the sale. the sale will have only a minor impact on mufgs and btmus financial results for the year ending march 31, 2018 (fy2018), mufg says. mufgs net profit has declined over the last two years, from u00a51.03 trillion in fy2015 to u00a5951.4 billion in fy2016 and u00a5926.4 billion in fy2017. its shareholding in cimb has varied over the years. in the last decade, the largest stake it held was 5.02%, in 2013. it has one representative on cimbs board, namely hiroaki demizu. now that it has exited the malaysian lender, it is understood that he will resign from the board. cimb, in response to questions from the edge, notes that, as with many banks around the world, capital optimisation is an important theme. the evolution of capital allocation and treatment over recent years means that capital management has become increasingly challenging for all banks, a spokesperson says. in fact, cimb, too, is in the process of divesting its 18.21% stake in bank of yingkou in china on the back of capital treatment and priorities, the spokesperson adds. mufgs exit comes during a year in which shares of banks, including cimbs, have run up as investors bet on a recovery in earnings after tepid growth in the previous year. cimbs share price has risen 43.86% so far this year, hitting a high of rm7.08 on aug 30. the counter closed at rm6.35 last thursday. nomura research believes the shares still have upside potential. it upgraded the stock to a buy from neutral last thursday and raised its target price by rm1.50 to rm7.90, citing cimb as the only stock within its coverage of malaysian banks to have a meaningful return on equity (roe) turnaround story. it expects cimbs roe to rise from 8.2% in 2016 to around 10% in 2018, notwithstanding the impact from the mfrs9 accounting standard, which will kick in from next year. maybank ib, meanwhile, maintains a buy on cimb with a rm7.50 target price. "}, "28": {"date_posted": "27/9/2017", "title": "not yet time to buy glove makers shares, say analysts ", "article": " the share prices of rubber glove makers have come off their highs in recent weeks after a good run from may to july, but analysts say it is not yet a good time to accumulate these stocks. pacific mutual fund sdn bhd ceo teh chi-cheun thinks glove makers are fairly valued at current levels despite the correction over the past two months. we think the glove sector is fairly valued. after the [recent] rally, most counters are trading at more than one standard deviation above mean. for those who bought earlier, they can continue to hold selected stocks, he tells the edge. bloomberg data shows that of the countrys four biggest glove makers, hartalega holdings bhd had the highest historical price-to-earnings ratio (per) of 33 times as at sept 14, 2017, while supermax corp bhd had the lowest at 17.34 times. kossan rubber industries bhds per was at 25.36 times, and top glove corp bhd, 22.78 times. inter-pacific research sdn bhd analyst david lai concurs, noting that the valuations of specific glove makers, in particular the bigger ones, are justified by their earnings. the bigger glove makers are fairly valued, but this is consistent with their earnings, he says. the smaller players are cheaper as their earnings tend to fluctuate, hence the market gives them a lower per, he explains. however, an industry player believes the resilience of glove makers justifies their current stock valuations. many investors claim glove counters are expensive but they probably overlook the reason they are pricey. there is no other industry that is as resilient, and moreover, this industry is recession-proof. regardless of good or bad economic conditions, all glove makers continue to maintain earnings and go on a continuous expansion spree, he tells the edge. the share prices of glove makers, except for supermax and rubberex corp (m) bhd, soared between may and july on lower latex costs. last month, rhb research analyst lim jia yi initiated coverage on comfort gloves bhd with a buy call, citing the groups specialisation in premium speciality gloves, ongoing capacity expansion for further business growth, potential steady growth in earnings, solid balance sheet and experienced management. our assigned per for comfort gloves remains below the big rubber glove players one-year forward per of 21 times, she says in her aug 14 report. last thursday, comfort glove traded at a per of 10.21 times. in a sept 14 report, maybank investment bank research analyst lee yen ling upgraded top glove to a buy with an unchanged target price of rm6.20, given the share price weakness and expectation of a positive fourth quarter ended aug 31, 2017 (fy2017) earnings growth on higher sales volume and lower raw material prices. however, pacific mutuals teh warns that the ringgits strengthening against the us dollar and a potential hike in average selling prices (asp) would affect smaller glove makers. gloves are a generic product and it is a volume game. customers dont have brand/supplier loyalty. while the big players can afford to take a lower asp and lower margins for a few quarters, small players dont have the economies of scale and the negative impact on their margins will be larger. the smaller players will be more affected by a reduction in volume post-asp hike, he says. last week, malaysian rubber glove manufacturers association president denis low jau foo urged industry players to raise their asp to reflect the rising production costs. low said in a statement that the higher raw material prices were due to the recent hurricane irma in the us, which severely affected the production of a raw material  butadiene  used in nitrile gloves, as well as the upcoming international tripartite rubber council, which will likely see rubber-producing nations introduce policies to induce higher rubber prices. low says the unfavourable foreign exchange rate has also put a dent on glove makers margins as the us dollar weakens against the ringgit. year to date, the ringgit has strengthened 6.37% against the greenback. in a note to investors last thursday, midf research analyst noor athila mohd razali downgraded kossan rubber to neutral, with an unchanged target price of rm7.57 due to the recent run-up in its share price. the malaysian rubber boards centrifuged latex price soared to a multi-year high of rm8.18 per kg on jan 31, the highest since oct 18, 2011, when it was trading at rm8.22 per kg. however, the price of the commodity declined to rm4.95 per kg on july 12  its lowest level since it hit rm4.94 per kg on oct 20 last year. since then, centrifuged latex price has pared its losses and appreciated 17.5% to trade at rm5.82 last thursday. "}, "29": {"date_posted": "27/9/2017", "title": "bonia starting to look attractive ", "article": " shares in bonia corp bhd rose with renewed vigour after the fashion retailer reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results on aug 30. between then and sept 12, the stock rose 17.7% to 66.5 sen. bonias net profit for the fourth quarter ended june 30 doubled to rm7.68 million from the previous corresponding period, which saw the group close fy2017 with a year-on-year earnings growth of 30.2% to rm31.73 million. the group attributed its improved bottom line to the higher gross profit margin it achieved during the year, thanks to its continuous effort to control operating costs. this was despite revenue slipping 4% year on year to rm153.39 million as the group consolidated its non-performing outlets and consignment counters. the marked improvement in its net profit prompted aminvestment bank research and cimb investment bank research to upgrade their recommendation on the stock to buy from hold. affin hwang investment bank research maintained its hold call on the counter. as bonia turns the corner, its stock could start looking attractive to investors, given its comparatively cheaper valuations. at 64 sen last thursday, bonia was trading at a trailing 12-month price-earnings ratio of 16.28 times  below that of its peers padini holdings bhd (19.02 times), hai-o enterprise bhd (27.35 times) and aeon co. (m) bhd (36.2 times). parkson holdings bhd is loss-making. the fashion retailer has been through some difficult times in recent years with the ringgit weakening against the us dollar and driving up the cost of goods, and the implementation of the goods and services tax hurting consumer sentiment. however, a change in strategy this year and less volatile foreign exchange rates seem to have helped bonia regain its footing. the company has been consolidating its operations by shutting down non-performing stores and consignment counters. aminvestment estimates that bonia has closed 22% of its consignment counters, leaving only 984 counters open as at 4qfy2017. also, instead of offering bigger discounts to drive sales as it did in the previous financial year, bonia has been adjusting its pricing strategy by introducing higher-margin products and reducing the discounts, especially for its upmarket brands bonia and braun bu00fcffel. aminvestment highlights in a research note that the companys gross margin for fy2017 improved by 3.5 percentage points to 58.6% on the back of higher average selling prices (asps). recall that margins contracted to a multi-year low in fy2016 (55%) from an average of 61%, off the back of higher us dollar-led input costs. given the stability of foreign exchange rates, there may be an upside for margins should management raise asps further in fy2018. apart from that, we expect the cost-savings associated with the closure of 22% of its consignment stores to trickle down to its earnings before interest and taxes (ebit) margins going into fy2018, says the research house. cimb opines that the better earnings are also a result of better cost control and lower advertising and promotional expenses during the year. the research house says the highlight of fy2017 is the growth of bonias indonesian business, which it believes is becoming a significant contributor to the groups sales and earnings. according to bonias 2016 annual report, indonesia contributed 2.9% to the groups revenue in fy2016. cimb estimates this to have grown to 6.3% in fy2017. this is mostly because of the opening of additional braun bu00fcffel boutiques and 23 counters in indonesia in september last year, it says. while analysts appear optimistic about bonias prospects going forward, the group is a bit more conservative. in its 4qfy2017 results announcement, the group says it expects prospects to remain challenging going forward, given the uncertain economic outlook. with the continued increase in imported merchandise cost due to the weakened ringgit, the group will continue to monitor its operating cost and cautiously adjust its selling price to cope with the rising cost of operation. bonia adds that it will also continue to consolidate its business by closing down non-performing outlets and strive to improve its gross margins. at the same time, it plans to develop and strengthen its markets in indonesia, vietnam and some of the middle eastern countries. though the group remains cautious, there is some good news for it. the consumer sentiments index inched up to 80.7 points in 2q2017, rising for the third consecutive quarter, although it is still below the 100-point threshold. at the same time, julys volume index of wholesale and retail trade  a key indicator of real private consumption  maintained its double-digit pace, growing 12.9% year on year for the fourth straight month, according to maybank investment bank research. this was attributed to seasonal spending during the fasting month and hari raya puasa celebrations in june and july. the research house says there are indications of consumer spending gaining momentum in the third quarter, evidenced by the fastest growth in domestic purchases by local credit cardholders in 11 months, and tourist spending, as tracked by local purchases by foreign credit cardholders, continuing to grow. at its 64 sen close last thursday, bonias share price had risen 16.8% year to date. the average target price for the stock, based on bloomberg consensus, is 71 sen.

"article": " throughout his career, lim tze chengs success at managing funds has been due to his ability to ignore market uncertainty and fear. this has enabled the ceo of inter-pacific asset management sdn bhd (interpac) to identify investment opportunities and outperform his peers. this ability was demonstrated during the 2008 global financial crisis when most investors were pulling out their investments from the equity market. in 2009, the selloff in global markets hit new lows. but instead of being fearful, lim  who was structuring the portfolio of corston smith asset management sdn bhds southeast asia equity fund  dove into the market looking for bargains. rather than viewing the market condition as a crisis, he saw it as a mega sale and bought into several blue-chip stocks in asean. they included the stocks of pt kalbe farma and unilever indonesia (which are listed on the indonesia stock exchange) and international container terminal services inc (which is on the philippine stock exchange), which were selling at a huge discount during the period. a fund manager friend at maybank asked if i was crazy as i was one of the few buying during the crisis. so, we made a bet that if there was no crash and the market recovered, he would treat me to a japanese lunch. but if it crashed, i would treat him instead, recalls lim. later on, he would be treated to a hearty japanese meal. the global markets did not totally collapse and after 2009, they embarked on a long recovery period and have not looked back since. lim says he knew this would be the case based on the data he had read on the level of cash us banks had deposited with the federal reserve at the time. the fed published a quarterly report on the total cash us banks deposit with the central bank. i remember that in the fourth quarter of 2008, i read one of these reports and noted that the banks had a high level of cash deposited with the fed. i decided to do more reading and concluded that it was not a real crisis. if the financial system has no cash, that is a real crisis. but if your banks have a high level of cash sitting with the fed, the so-called crisis is due to a lack of liquidity because banks are not giving out loans. this is not a real crisis, but a short-term phenomenon. that is why when the fed started to lower interest rates and the banks were forced to give out loans, the market recovered. that is what gave me the confidence to buy during the crisis. not many people took note of the reports because of the bad news reported in the media and there were fears that the market would crash. lim says that until he left corston smith in 2010, the firm held on to the stocks. i am not sure if they were sold off after that. but if they had kept them until today, they would have made huge returns. he joined osk-uob investment management bhd as a portfolio manager after leaving corston smith. the fund house then merged with rhb investment management sdn bhd in 2013. he joined interpac as ceo in december last year. before lim joined interpac, the companys unit trust funds had been experiencing negative performance since 2014. but under his leadership, the funds saw a turnaround. as at aug 26, the dynamic equity fund had generated a return of 52.91% year to date while the dana safi achieved a return of 57.65%, according to bloomberg data. the cash holdings of both funds were also reduced to 5% (as at end-june) from about 80%, with the rest reinvested in the market. as at end-june, the top three holdings of the interpac dynamic equity fund were visdynamics holdings bhd, united uli-corp bhd and sem kou resources bhd while interpac dana safis top three holdings were visdynamics holdings bhd, techfast holdings bhd and oka corp bhd.  a solid foundation lim attributes his ability to cut through market noise and remain true to his convictions when making investment decisions to his mentor tan teng boo, the founder, ceo and managing director of capital dynamics group. he had joined capital dynamics as an analyst in 2003 after a short stint as an accountant at bdo malaysia. it was very tough. every month, we lost a few analysts. they lasted only about three months on average. over the six years i was there, we lost about 60 people a year. at one point, i even plotted a chart and found that the peak month [for analysts leaving] was april, says lim. it was tough because he had to conduct thorough research on the entire value chain of an industry before visiting a company. he also had to meet up with all the relevant regulators to understand the industrys regulations. then, he had to talk with the representatives of government agencies such as the malaysian investment development authority to gain knowledge of government incentives and foreign investment flows. he also had to meet with the competitors of a particular company as well as its suppliers. company visits were the last thing we were allowed to do and many analysts did not have the patience to go through the process, says lim. more importantly, he had no access to brokers reports nor a bloomberg terminal, which are important sources of market information. this was due to the cost-saving measures implemented by the firm. another reason was to allow its analysts to make independent judgement calls and produce their own research reports instead of being affected by what was being said in the market. we did not have any bloomberg [terminals] and all the brokers reports went to tan. at the time, i did not even know there were brokers reports. this means that if you want to analyse something, you had to analyse it from scratch as you do not know what kind of calls the other brokers are making [about the companies you are looking at]. the independence is really there. lim took six months to produce his first analyst report. even then, he could not obtain tans approval easily. if you talked nonsense, he would challenge you. this was partly because he had access to brokers reports. but at the time, i was young. i also did not know he had access to this information and wondered how he knew all these things, he says. despite the challenges, lim appreciated tans patience in allowing him to take his time to learn things. he is very patient and does not compromise. that is one thing i admire about him. it is the same when it comes to investments. he really does not care what the market is saying, whether it is a buy or sell. if he likes a stock, he can wait years to buy, sell or hold on to it. his patience is really amazing and i respect him for this. that is one of the reasons why i worked for him for six years, he says.  bullish on test companies in tech sector while lim still describes his investment strategy as value investing  buying and holding undervalued stocks before realising gains in the long term  he prefers to avoid words such as value and long term. these words are overused. when you say long term, what do you really mean? when the stock rallies by 10% to 15% and it hits your target return in the short term, obviously the next logical step is to sell. that is not long term. also, what is value? how do you determine it and do you really stick to the intrinsic value and market value of your analyst report when investing? instead, lim calls his investment style business-centric, which means he has a very strong focus on the businesses of companies. he looks for companies with the ability to generate earnings by continually evolving their business models and expanding their businesses. share price volatility is not much of a concern as he can ride it out with patience and conviction. for now, lims favourite sector is technology due to its growth potential. he likes test companies that utilise technology to conduct tests on electrical and electronics (e&e) components such as light-emitting diode (led) lights and smartphone chips. many local companies belong to this category. these companies, which have seen their share prices more than double in the past 12 months, make up about 30% of interpacs portfolio. lim likes these companies because he believes that their earnings growth will increase further as the demand for e&e components continues to climb, driven mainly by cars rather than smartphones. five years ago, there was a massive overcapacity in e&e components. however, the demand for these components has surged in the past two years, he says. you would ask why as smartphone sales have not seen a huge increase. but smartphones are not the biggest consumer items globally  it is cars. according to statistics, 400 million smartphones and 90 million cars are sold every year. but what is the price of a smartphone compared with that of a car? globally, cars are becoming more electronic, says lim. not only are regular cars using more e&e components, there is the emerging trend of hybrid, electric and autonomous cars. hybrid and electric cars allow drivers to save on fuel costs while contributing to a greener environment. tesla has just introduced the first affordable autonomous car, the model 3, which costs us$35,000 each. cars today use more e&e components than they used to. and even more will be used in the future. so, it is the car industry that has been causing the surge in demand, not smartphones, says lim. companies he likes include elsoft research bhd, one of the core holdings of his funds. there are also vitrox corp bhd, which conducts visual testing for e&e components such as led lights, and aemulus holdings bhd, which conducts testing for wireless chips used in smartphones and other devices. [local companies] are quite strong in the testing business and they are supplying their services globally. these companies will be the beneficiaries of the bigger trend, says lim, adding that it is based on this strategy that he does not hold the stocks of some semiconductor companies that many other fund managers are holding.  bright outlook for manufacturers with strong export presence lim also likes companies with a regional or global presence in the consumer manufacturing sector. my portfolio is very manufacturing-centric. i wont touch things i dont understand. i need to see and touch them if i want to invest in them, he says. oriental food industries holdings bhd and power root bhd are two companies he likes in this sector. they have been expanding their export business, which has enabled them to generate good earnings despite weak local consumption in recent years. about 50% of their business comes from exports. that is why they are still able to perform when domestic consumption is soft, says lim. last year, people were talking about the weakening ringgit that would benefit export-oriented companies. these companies have also seen an increase in the sales volume of their products in new markets. he also looks at the evolution of these companies. one example is oriental food, whose product super ring has been popular since it was introduced more than a decade ago. but when the healthy food trend came along, the company replaced its artificial cheese flavouring with a natural one. it also expanded into healthier snacks such as jacker potato crisps. the companys latest product is biscuits, he says. you can see the companys evolution into manufacturing and selling higher-grade products. on top of that, it manufactures products for some japanese brands, which is not easy. this shows that management is thinking about the long term. in fact, the company has been around for more than 30 years, says lim. he adds that investors who look into companies like these have to accept that their revenue growth will not be exponential. the natural growth rate is 5% to 8% per annum. but there will be a bigger jump when they increase production capacity. while lim has a positive view on the tech and consumer product sectors, he is actually sector and capitalisation-neutral. it is a companys business that matters. i am very business-centric. as long as your business is good, i will invest in it. it just so happens that the companies i like are in these two sectors. they are not big caps. companies that are properly managed and have good earnings growth tend to be in the small and mid-cap categories, he says.  global economy recovering being a bottom-up stock picker, lim says the real risks of his investment style are those related to the companys business such as a change in management. lets say, the founder and ceo passes away and there is a complete change in management. this is definitely one of the key business risks. he also considers selling a stock when the company starts to diversify into sectors that are not relevant to its core businesses. based on his experience, most companies that embark on diversification fail to generate good earnings. it is a warning sign and i am usually quite worried when they do that. diversification does not work out most of the time based on history. it shows that the company is not so confident about the future of its core businesses, says lim. normally, with the excess capital you have, you invest in your core businesses. when you start diversifying, doesnt it mean that you are seeing something that is not quite right in your core businesses? he says companies should distribute their earnings via dividend payouts to shareholders instead of using it to diversify. for instance, a glove maker that diversifies into property. why do i need you to diversify? if i want to have property exposure, i can buy into another company that has a focus on the property business. why dont you distribute your earnings to shareholders? on the macroeconomic side, lim does not see a global economic crisis happening soon. in fact, he says the global economy is still in recovery and there are a few more years to go. the two indicative numbers he is looking at are the global gross domestic product and crude oil prices. lim says the global gdp has not seen as strong a recovery as in previous post-crisis periods. in fact, it has only increased gradually and is expected to climb slowly and steadily in the years to come. meanwhile, oil prices are currently low, compared with a spike during pre-crisis periods in the past. yes, people are saying that this is the longest global recovery in modern history. but look, it is also the slowest recovery. yes, gdp is growing, but it is not as strong as what we have seen in history, says lim. what i am trying to say is whatever efforts you have seen done by central banks and governments globally, such as lowering interest rates and fiscal pump-priming, the effects have only started to be felt since the second half of last year. the [global economic] engine has just started to move, not only in the us. meanwhile, he does not believe that north koreas missile threat is a possible black swan event that could trigger a global economic meltdown. it is market noise. if you track the countrys history, once every four years, it wants to launch missiles [but this has never translated into a war with the us]. looking at the big picture, china and russia do not want a war either. both countries will step in if a war breaks out. but their economies are doing very well, so why would they want that to happen?   fulfilling a dream one of the reasons why lim tze cheng became ceo of inter-pacific asset management sdn bhd (interpac) was to start a fund that could create a positive impact on society. the interpac social enterprise and social responsibility fund was introduced in may. this does not come as a surprise as lim has been donating half his salary to charity since 2007. while he can afford to have a luxurious life, he still drives a scooter to work every day and lives in a modest apartment. i would like to have a mercedes-benz and live in a bungalow; they are nice. but are they necessary? most of my money goes to charitable causes. i dont keep much for myself, says lim. he has always been involved in charitable causes, partly due to his humble family background. he was born and raised in muar, johor. his father was a bus conductor who worked on the buses that travelled between muar and batu pahat. lim, who is the youngest of six siblings, started working in factories when he was 13 to help reduce the familys burden and buy the things he wanted. in university, he started a business where he imported stationery from china and sold it to the cooperatives in schools and universities to pay for his education and living expenses. anything i wanted back then, i had to earn it myself. nothing was handed to me by my parents. that is also how i have been throughout my life, says lim. another incident that contributed to his involvement in charitable causes is the fact that his elder brother was a drug addict and he had seen how his brother asked for money from his parents to buy drugs. i can tell you that my eldest brother was a drug addict since i was a year old. what you read in the newspapers or see on the big screen about drug addicts is true, he says. because of this, lim has always wanted to do something more for society. when he joined interpac, he seized the opportunity to

fabrication in oil and gas segment (19%), construction (10%) and power plant (3%). maybank ib, in its note to clients, expressed concern on the amount owed by eversendais customers, and increasing

come, says economics professor", "article": " banks may introduce more attractive deposit schemes soon, either by raising deposit rates or providing other forms of incentives, due to the higher loan-to-deposit (ld) ratio of banks, says sunway university economics professor dr yeah kim leng. \"with the ld ratio hovering at the 90% level, banks are likely to intensify their campaigns to boost fixed and savings deposits,\" he points out. yeah says the competitiveness will be determined by the demand for loans, where strong growth will require banks to push for higher deposits or seek out more expensive funding via the debt capital markets. \"there will be more volatility as the debt capital markets are tied to the prevailing financial conditions,\" he adds. yeah says banks could also \"reduce lending to maintain the appropriate ld ratio, albeit at the expense of missed opportunities in terms of higher business volume and profit\". his comments come on the back of reports that malayan banking bhd (maybank) had the highest ld ratio in the local banking sector (99.2%) as at march while the banking sector as a whole was contending with slower deposit growth against loan expansion. in the report, a cimb analyst noted that the local banking sector's ld ratio had risen from 76.2% in february 2012 to 90.4% in june this year. however, he added that more indicators needed to be taken into consideration to come up with a more realistic assessment of liquidity. \"indicators such as loan-to-fund ratio and capital have increasingly become more reflective of the lending capacity of banks as they take into consideration the other sources of funding that can be tapped by the banks,\" he says. according to the analyst, one of the key reasons for the lagging ld ratio is the prevailing low interest rates which have caused depositors to shift to higher-yielding vehicles or assets, such as unit trusts and stock investments. \"a second reason is the decline in household savings due to weak wage and income growth. third, a rise in the cost of living has resulted in squeezed savings for households and this has affected deposits,\" says yeah."}, "36": {"date_posted":

appreciated by 25.4%, from rm12.49 to rm15.66, between april 1, 2014, and june 30, 2017  the period of review for the edge billion ringgit club (brc). while that only translates into a single-digit 7.2% annualised return over the period of three years and three months, it is ahead of six other large banking peers that are also brc members. this year alone, hong leong bank saw a 17.3% gain up to the cut-off date. the strong gain came on the back of a solid recovery in profitability at bank of chengdu co ltd (boc), a china-based lender in which hong leong bank has a 20% strategic stake. bocs profit contribution to hong leong bank improved 3.7% year on year to rm242 million in the nine months ended march 31 (9mfy2017), underpinned by a strong 25.9% y-o-y rebound in the third quarter. it accounted for 11.7% of hong leong banks profit before tax in 9mfy2017. bocs recovery, deemed to be sustainable after a strong bout of loan loss provisions since 1qfy2016, was the main reason for a slew of target price and earnings upgrades on hong leong bank by analysts right after the lender released its 3qfy2017 results on may 29. this led to a surge in its share price in june and july, with the counter peaking at the years high of rm16.30 on july 5. given the strong price appreciation, some now see limited upside for the stock, although they continue to like the lenders strong fundamentals. bloomberg data shows that of 18 analysts that track hong leong bank, 10 have a hold call and eight have a buy with a 12-month target price of rm15.26. its closing price on aug 1 was

says in a july 18 report. hong leong banks earnings in 9mfy2017 grew 24% y-o-y to rm1.66 billion, coming in within consensus estimates. the growth was supported by higher operating income, lower provisions and higher profit contribution from boc. annualised return on equity was at 10.4%, within the banks full-year target of 10% to 11%. the bank is in a good position to grow earnings further. it is the only one of the countrys eight local lenders that has managed to see sequential growth in net interest margins (nim) for four consecutive quarters. with the lowest loan-to-deposit ratio in the industry at 81.1% (industry: 88.8%), the group is in the strongest position to enhance nim via more aggressive asset utilisation and/or effectively manage funding cost by only focusing on expanding casa (current account and savings account deposits) versus more expensive time deposits, notes uob kay hian research in a june 16 report. the bank also continues to display strong asset quality, with one of the lowest gross impaired loans ratio in the industry, at 0.88%, and solid loan impairment coverage ratio of 106%. going forward, protection of our business franchise and

the previous financial year. nonetheless, the bottom line was lower, with brc members posting a collective pre-tax profit of rm112.5 billion in fy2016 compared with rm115.3 billion in fy2015. collective net profit was rm81.6 billion in fy2016 compared with rm85.4 billion in fy2015, rm87.8 billion in fy2014 and rm85.5 billion in fy2013. collective fy2016 earnings were weighed down by

chemical and ethnic origin", "article": " man, how time flies. its august already. and the nation turns 60 later this month. sixty! normally, celebrations of this milestone are raucous affairs, with bawdy tales of lives well-lived and warm wishes for many good years ahead. but we greeted august with tumult as lotte chemical titan holdings bhd displayed fgv-like attributes to lose a third of its market value in a matter of days. its listing was the biggest in malaysia since the heady days of felda global ventures holdings bhds debut  perhaps not a positive omen after all. so what happened at lotte chemical? was it such a stretch that an outage that was no secret  the disruption of its water supply had apparently been mentioned in its ipo prospectus  could have been so misunderstood as to result in such a savage drop in earnings and expectations? by all indications, the extent of the year-on-year drop in earnings took everyone by surprise. and how could eastspring investments, maybank and permodalan nasional have misread lotte chemical so badly? as long-term pension funds built on investment mandates of stability and predictability, lotte chemicals losses will only hurt risk-averse unitholders. the irony of ironies! while lotte chemical did not generate the kind of buzz normally reserved for big-ticket ipos, one indication of its buoyancy was a ta research report from early july that called a buy and a target price of  wait for it  rm7.41. a sign of lotte chemicals looming troubles could have come from the assorted errata in its prospectus, which had led ta to drop its target price from an earlier rm9.10, due to what it reasoned would equate to higher feedstock prices for the company. and to what extent should maybank, the listings arrangers, be made culpable? should it have been more careful in its assessment of lotte chemicals business? perhaps it should have been a little more guarded in terms of the way it sold the company to investors during bookbuild? assumed a greater duty of care for its pension fund cornerstone investors? the magnitude of lotte chemicals losses and the reach of the impact recall a move some five years earlier in hong kong. the securities and futures commission (sfc) had proposed to toughen the hong kong stock exchanges code of conduct for ipo sponsors and make them liable for the contents of listing prospectuses. the genesis of this proposal followed a string of scandals at chinese companies that had gone public in hong kong, only to face accusations  and in some cases, proof  of fraud shortly thereafter. while there remains no sign whatsoever of such misdeeds at lotte chemical, the volatility of todays markets could and should also engender more caution than necessary. and its not that lotte chemical should be 100% exempt of any suspicion. as financial times reporter song jung-a points out in an article last month, the companys original listing attempt was shelved as its parent, lotte group, had been engulfed by a corruption scandal. the seoul-based reporter writes: lotte groups chairman shin dong-bin (had been) on trial for charges of bribery, tax evasion and embezzlement u2026 (and) was also embroiled in a family feud over succession between mr shin and his older brother, shin dong-joo. the corruption investigation has had a negative impact on some of lottes businesses. he adds that lotte group last year scrapped a us$4.5 billion ipo for its hotel unit, which runs hotels and duty-free shops in south korea, russia, the us and vietnam. it is unfair (and probably invalid) for a direct read-across to be applied between both markets and entities. but as shareholders and unitholders alike grapple with their losses and wonder if the disruption was indeed an isolated incident (or otherwise), such questions will continue to be raised. speaking of anniversaries, 60 is an exalted number. certainly, most people of this vintage would have outgrown their petty prejudices and idiosyncrasies and settled into a life of rumination and reflection. but the too-public spat over former primeminister tun dr mahathir mohamads ethnic origin certainly was not becoming. so what if his father originated from the indian subcontinent? or for that matter, so what if certain cabinet ministers have javanese, thai or chinese blood? should it matter? especially for a country that spends hundreds of millions on a global ad campaign that supposedly celebrates its ethnic diversity? tell you one thing, though. donald trump may be a lot of things, but he is right about one thing: america is great. but lest we forget, americas greatness was built on the sweat, industry and toil of its immigrants, who came seeking a better life and were thus willing to work hard for it. why not malaysia too? as we approach our sixth decade as a country, shouldnt we focus on how to improve our economic competitiveness, the nations wealth and the well-being of the citizenry? this countrys politicians need to realise  now  that there are far more pressing matters at hand than the race of someones father or mother. the sooner they realise this, the more valid their existence will be, rather than the dubious platforms on which they wobble currently. khoo hsu chuang is contributing editor at the edge malaysia"}, "42": {"date_posted": "7/8/2017", "title": "better corporate earnings seen in second quarter", "article": " kuala lumpur: the road to recovery was the theme during the earnings reporting season for the first quarter of this year (1q17). as the 2q17 earnings season gets underway, investors are moving on to the next theme  that of sustainable revenue and earnings growth. all eyes will be on whether the companies can repeat their performances seen in 1q17. malaysias stock market has regained some ground, with the fbm klci and fbm small cap index earning a total return of 9.9% and 18.3% respectively so far this year. but will the companies 2q17 earnings keep pace with the rally in the local equity market? according to jf apex securities bhd head of research lee chung cheng, companies are likely to report better earnings in 2q17 compared with the year-ago period in line with the better outlook for the year on the back of improved economic activity. however, well have to wait for [malaysian company] earnings to catch up with the stock market valuation. the market wont be cheap, lee told the edge financial daily over the telephone. in a report dated aug 2, maybank investment bank research (maybank ib research) said data points to the country sustaining its growth momentum of 1q17, where gross domestic product (gdp) growth was 5.6%. our economics team forecasts 5.1% real gdp growth in 2017, while the official 2017 real gdp growth forecast of 4.3% to 4.8% could be raised soon, potentially together with the release of 2q17 gdp on aug 18, it added. still, going into 2h17, maybank ib research remains cautiously constructive on malaysian equities, with a slightly neutral bias after 1h17s gains. for malaysian equities, the key positives are the domestic macros which should remain positive throughout 2017 while market/corporate earnings growth looks set to resume. that said, we stay mindful of the prevailing external policy and geopolitical headwinds, amid an extended period of market calm and low volatility for most of 2017 year to date (ytd). volatility, as measured by the chicago board options exchange volatility index, has continued to stay at low levels. volatility has also retreated in the other asset classes with the exception of crude oil, it said. while optimism abounds, mercury securities sdn bhd head of research edmund tham said the market has become more cautious as reflected in its trading volume. if you look at the trading volume, it has gone down quite significantly. at one time, the average daily trading volume was consistently above three billion shares. right now, its only about one billion shares, tham told the edge financial daily. the average daily trading volume on bursa malaysia stood at 2.8 billion shares in 1h17 but it has since tapered off. last friday, trading volume totalled 1.42 billion shares worth rm1.47 billion. meanwhile, tham expects both upside and downside earnings surprises in this reporting season rather than things being good or bad for a specific industry. below are the expectations and views of analysts for the 2q17 earnings season in some of the sectors: construction according to public investment bank bhd research analyst tan siang hing, most of the construction companies under its coverage will continue to see good earnings. they (earnings) will still be good. the earnings visibility of most of them is still good. given the higher order book seen, technically, the earnings will also be higher, he said. while tan conceded that the valuations of construction stocks are not cheap, he said their share prices tend to move in tandem with news flow. if there is news flow to support, the share prices will be able to sustain, he said, pointing to the light rail vehicle work package valued at rm1.56 billion that was awarded to the consortium of crrc zhuzhou locomotive co ltd, siemens ltd china and tegap dinamik sdn bhd recently. in a report dated aug 3, maybank ib research construction analyst adrian wong said there are expectations of major civil packages (viaducts and guideways) to be awarded next, with potential beneficiaries including gamuda bhd, ijm corp bhd, sunway construction group bhd and kimlun corp bhd. ytd, the kuala lumpur construction index has outperformed the benchmark fbm klci index with a total return of 19.8%. semiconductor midf research analyst martin foo chuan loong is optimistic about semiconductor companies financial performance for 2q17. this is supported by the latest export data which showed malaysias exports rising 10% year-on-year to rm73.1 billion in june, as the country sold more electrical and electronics besides palm oil products. take a look at the events that will unfold in this quarter, with apple expected to launch the latest iphone and samsung a new note, and this is just the big players we are talking about. in order for these stocks to be ready, production is required in 2q17. thus, production volume would be ramped up which should lead to better earnings [for semiconductor companies], said foo. he also pointed to the improved global sales data, which should bode well for 2q17. on how a stronger ringgit would affect exporters such as the semiconductor players, foo said most of the players in this space have a natural hedge to the currency. usually, only about 50% of the cost is in us dollars. i dont think the impact from foreign exchange fluctuations will be significant, he added. nevertheless, foo agrees that the valuations of semiconductor stocks are currently on the high side, noting that the share prices have run ahead of earnings season. banking/finance the banking sector is expected to post muted earnings, with 2q17 results expected to be marginally higher from a year ago but would not reflect the strong earnings seen in 1q17, said hong leong investment bank research analyst khairul azizi kairudin. he pointed out that due to the hari raya festive holidays, which resulted in june being a shorter month, leading to lower loan applications, there could be a moderation in bank earnings growth in 2q17 compared with 1q17. on the outlook for the banking sector, we maintain our neutral stance due to modest growth outlook for earnings, loan and deposit growth. the modest earnings growth will result in lower roe (return on equity) and the lower expected return, he said. maybank ib research also has a neutral call on the sector but expects loan growth to pick up pace in 2h17. the pickup in non-household loan growth is encouraging, and we look forward to ongoing expansion in this segment if our industry loan growth estimate of 5.4% for 2017 is to be achieved, against annualised loan growth of 3.5% to date, said maybank ib research banking analyst desmond chng in his report dated aug 2. aviation cimb equities research regional transport analyst raymond yap is confident that airasia bhds 2q17 results will outperform that of 1q17. we believe the higher domestic market share will help improve 2q17 and 2h17 (second half of 2017) yields, helping reverse the yield pressures in malaysia felt during 1q17, he said. we believe load factors rose from 88% in 1q17 to an all-time high of 90% in 2q17. airasias 1q17 results disappointed the market due to the rm140 million to rm150 million one-off moving cost but we think this is unlikely to recur in 2q17. macro factors are also supportive of stronger earnings as the us dollar weakened 2.6% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) to an average of rm4.33 while jet fuel prices fell 4.3% q-o-q, yap said in a report dated july 17. midf research analyst tay yow ken also expects airasia to post better results in 2q17 based on its preliminary operating statistics. the operating statistics showed demand was slightly higher than expected, even though second quarter is traditionally a weak quarter, he said. on the industry outlook, tay is positive about both airasia and malaysia airports holdings bhd in 2h17, pointing to more sporting events as well as the easing of visa applications, which would lead to higher tourist arrival in the country. media the outlook for the media industry, meanwhile, remains challenging. although we see improvements in the macro environment, we have yet to see a substantial recovery in the media sector, largely because companies still remain cautious and adopt a wait-and-see approach to adex (advertising expenditure) spending, a media analyst who declined to be named said. in addition, media companies also face the gradual but long-term structural shift in consumer preference towards mostly free online content. although media and telecommunications players are trying to adapt and change by digitalising their business models, its not easy to monetise digital content in this information-exploding era. in malaysian newsprint industries sdn bhds (mni) case, its [liquidation] was mainly because of the cheap imports that rendered the local manufacturing firm with higher production costs uncompetitive, he said. last week, hong leong industries bhd and media prima bhd announced that mni had initiated creditors voluntary winding up proceedings amid declining newsprint demand and three straight years of losses. kenanga research analyst cheow ming liang also shared the same sentiment in his report dated july 20. he said while the countrys 2017 adex sentiment is set to be supported by several major events such as the [emailprotected]: golden celebration campaign, 29th southeast asian games, ninth asean para games, and a potential 14th general election, these feel-good factors are likely to be offset by a weak ringgit against the us dollar and the rising cost of doing business."}, "43": {"date_posted": "1/8/2017", "title": "declining share price makes bfood look attractive ", "article": " when michelin-starred hong kong dim sum restaurant tim ho wan and five other international brands announced their shutdown in malaysia, doubts were raised about other brands operations, particularly those in the intensely competitive food and beverage (f&b) industry. berjaya food bhd (bfood), which has three international brands in its portfolio  starbucks coffee, kenny rogers roasters (krr) and jollibean foods cafu00e9  saw its share price go downhill after hitting a 52-week high of rm1.95 on march 9. the f&b operators maiden quarterly net loss in its fourth quarter ended april 30, 2017 (4qfy2017) could further dampen sentiment. in the last four months or so, the counter has depreciated 27%, settling at rm1.44 last thursday  near its 52-week low of rm1.24  giving the company a market capitalisation of rm539.51 million. while some investors may be struggling to find the right time to cut their losses, there are others who see this as a bargain purchase opportunity. remember what warren buffett told berkshire hathaway [inc] investors earlier this year: widespread fear is your friend as an investor, because it serves up bargain purchases. that is whats happening with bfood now. the current share price is attractive, a fund manager tells the edge over the phone. bfoods downside is limited now after its restructuring ... it closed non-performing stores under broaster (berjaya roasters (m) sdn bhd). and we are buying on its starbucks growth story. it is worth noting that at rm1.44, the stock is trading at a historical price-earnings ratio (per) of 47.68 times, based on earnings per share of 3.02 sen for fy2017. in comparison, at its peak of rm1.95, the counter was traded at a per of 34.45 times. the company slipped into the red in 4qfy2017 with a net loss of rm3.37 million, compared with a net profit of rm3.17 million in the previous year. bfood blames the loss on the economic slowdown, which compelled the management to undertake measures to curtail further losses such as the closure of non-performing restaurants. an f&b industry veteran who is familiar with the group tells the edge that broaster, which operates krr  the main drag  had expanded too fast since bfoods listing in 2011. it took them about 17 years to grow from one store in 1994 to 51 stores in 2011, but in just five or six years, there were 100 krr stores. that is too fast. a lot of issues were not sorted out to support the business. it was like opening new stores for the sake of opening, he says. but that does not mean it is not a good business. krr has been making money since the listing and it has been cash flow positive all the time. but just one year of losses and everybody is feeling panicky. there were diverse views from the research community on bfoods 4qfy2017 performance. among the six research houses that cover bfood, two have buy calls; three, hold; and one, reduce. maybank ib research analyst kevin wong, who upgraded the stock from hold to buy, says while he remains cautious on krrs outlook, he is still upbeat on berjaya starbucks coffee co sdn bhds (bstarbucks) prospects. [we] upgrade [the stock] to buy as we believe the companys near-term earnings will stabilise. bfood currently offers a potential capital upside of 11%, he says in a june 15 note. wong has a target price of rm1.70 for the stock. cimb research analyst kristine wong, who downgraded bfood to reduce, believes that the stocks valuation is rich. she has a target price of rm1.38 for the counter. significant recovery in consumer spending is a key upside risk to our call, she says in a june 14 report, when bfood was trading at rm1.53 per share. even though bfoods earnings came in below expectations [in fy2017], we expect its performance to improve in fy2018 as krr losses narrow [with the closure of non-profitable outlets] and starbucks continues to expand. while some analysts suggest that disposing of krr could be a re-rating catalyst for bfood, an industry source who is close to the higher echelons of the group, says there is no immediate plan to do that. they are left with about 80 krr stores in the country, and all of them are making money. the only problem is [the] indonesia [business], but they are fixing it. from what i understand, there is no plan for a disposal now, he says. as for starbucks, they are trying to maintain the expansion at 30 outlets a year. it is still a growth story because of the branding, and its halal. people can drink up to four times a day; it is like a recurring business, unlike tim ho wan or krr. that kind of business is very competitive; people usually go there only once or twice a week.

over wavering sentiment following lukewarm response to the integrated petrochemical producers share offer that was cut to 580 million from 740.48 million. the institutional portion was cut by 23.4% to

by five cornerstone investors, namely permodalan nasional bhd, maybank asset management sdn bhd, maybank islamic asset management sdn bhd, eastspring investments bhd and great eastern life assurance

ipo has surpassed that of eco world international bhd worth rm2.58 billion in april. lotte chemical titan had wanted to go for listing last year but postponed it after south korea began to investigate conglomerate lotte group for alleged wrongdoing. the company has set aside rm2.8 billion of the proceeds to partially fund its rm15.5 billion integrated petrochemical facility in merak, indonesia. some rm620 million will go towards building a new polypropylene plant in johor and another rm220 million towards upgrading its existing naphtha cracker. the group operates 14 plants in malaysia and indonesia that are supported by on-site facilities such as co-generation plants, tank farms and wastewater treatment. its customers in malaysia and indonesia are mainly plastic fabricators serving the packaging, household, automotive and construction markets. last year, lotte chemical titan was the fourth largest manufacturer of polyolefin products in southeast asia by production capacity. it accounted for 42% of olefin production in malaysia and 29% of polyolefin production in indonesia. its capacity in polyethylene production was 53% in malaysia and 57% in indonesia while it produced all of the polypropylene in malaysia. polyolefins are used to make consumer and industrial products such as packaging film, trash bags, automotive parts, plastic bottles and caps, and compounds for wire and cable insulation while olefins are used as primary feedstock for the production of polyolefin goods. in the financial year ended dec 31, 2016 (fy2016), polyolefin product sales accounted for 80% of the companys revenue. net profit more than doubled to rm1.32 billion from rm613.21 million in fy2015 while revenue fell 0.14% to rm8.14 billion. prior to the cut in the ipo price, several research houses valued lotte chemical titan at more than rm8, and even as high as rm9.10. hong leong investment bank (hlib), however, valued the stock at rm7.39, being 12 times fy2018 earnings. in a june 28 note, hlib research analyst lim sin kiat says the reasons for the stocks lower valuation compared with its larger peers, like petronas chemicals group bhd (petchem), include higher volatility in product spread and lower earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) margin. according to lim, lotte chemical titans naphtha-based feedstock is highly correlated with oil prices, which explains the stocks volatility, while petchem uses ethane, a gas-based feedstock whose prices are more stable. post-2017, global polyolefin capacity surplus over demand is expected to widen further due to us shale-based capacity expansion and methanol-based china capacity additions, the note reads, adding that petchem would be adding 1.4 million tonnes of polyolefin capacity by 2020. the research house expects the expansion in global capacity to weigh on lotte chemical titans ebitda margins and revenue. still, the expected dividend yield of the stock is 3% in fy2017. according to its ipo prospectus, lotte chemical titan aims to pay out about 50% of its net profit every fiscal year on a consolidated basis after taking into account working capital and maintenance capital expenditure requirements. the company will still be controlled by lotte chemical corp post-ipo with a 74.9% stake. maybank investment bank bhd is the principal adviser, joint global

price surge by 82.23% in the first half of 2017 (1h17). inter-pacific research, which gave a buy call on the largest original manufacturer for nike in malaysia, has since upgraded the target price (tp) from rm5.72 at the beginning of the year to rm7.50 in the latest research report dated june 29. however, the research house has tweaked its view on the company to neutral. brian yeoh, the analyst who tracks the company, said in his report that he expects the garment maker to see its earnings in the financial year 2018 (fy18) and fy19 remain flat as its capacity utilisation is almost full. we have turned cautious about earnings growth as its top customer, nike, has been affected by a sluggish retail environment, slow us apparel industry sales and rising competitive pressure from adidas and under armour, yeoh said. the groups managing director, tan poay seng, however, told the edge financial daily that magni-tech still has capacity to grow from its current level with the construction of the first phase of its new factory in vietnam expected in the first quarter next year. we have started construction to build a modern and green flagship factory in vietnam on a 44.2 sq m strategic land in tien giang province, tan said. according to him, the first phase would see an additional output of 10 million pieces of garments per year. the second phase is targeted to be completed by the first quarter of 2019, which will increase the output of another 10 million pieces per year. the question on whether nike could maintain its earnings growth was posed at the beginning of 2017 but the sportswear giants latest financial results topped analysts expectations, helped by strong sales growth outside the us. it is also interesting to see how nikes latest collaboration with amazon and instagram will pan out as nike will soon start selling sneakers and other sporting goods through these platforms. while the latest tie-up could be a game changer and benefit magni-tech in the longer run, there has not been a lot of success by retail, luxury and beauty brands over selling to social media-addicted millennials. nonetheless, nikes decision to turn to amazon and instagram for the next phase of growth bodes well for investors as its share price jumped by 10.96% to us$59 (rm253.70) from us$53.17. as for magni-tech, despite a strong share-price performance, it is trading at a trailing

offloading (fpso) unit. the offshore oil and gas (o&g) services provider has seen a 15.15% return year to date, in terms of share price. the stock closed at 76 sen on june 30 up from 66 sen at the start of 2017. choo swee kee of ta investment management continues to remain positive about the stock for the next six months in light of the establishment of a new fpso in ghana. our hope is that all the bad news is out and moving forward earnings could start to pick up, he told the edge financial daily. net profit for the first financial quarter of fy17 (1qfy17) doubled to rm48.11 million on higher fpso contribution although revenue slipped 6.17% to rm404.17 million due to lower utilisation of its offshore support vessel (osv). however, the results marked a turnaround from a poor 4qfy16, with a net loss of rm1.29 billion due to impairment charges. according to bloomberg data, 10 analysts have a buy recommendation on the stock while eight recommend holding it. cimb research resumed coverage on the company, asias largest fpso and osv operator, in early june with an add call, saying that with two terrible years now behind it, the group can look forward to improved earnings and cash flow. however, aminvest research, which has a hold call on the stock, said that the cessation of fpso operations in nigeria warranted a cautious outlook for its near-term earnings trajectory.  by samantha ho   inari amertron bhd\none main catalyst for inari amertron bhd being chosen as one of the top picks for the year was the anticipated positive impact from iphones 10th anniversary this year especially with the company having a solid relationship with broadcom, which has a three-year supply agreement with apple until 2018. the initial fear of how trumps protectionism policy would affect inari has also subsided, which is positive for the group as well. affin hwang investment bank bhds analyst, kevin low, said in his report dated june 29, that inari should see a seasonal pickup in the radio frequency division to facilitate new builds for its us customer in 2h17. he said that inari is upgrading tester capacity by 10% to 770 units. according to low, production of the iris chips has gradually ramped up to its installed capacity of five million units per month after being fully qualified in february this year and he expected the capacity to double in july with further plans of capacity expansion by the third quarter of this year, bringing installed capacity closer to the 16 million units per month level. the iris chips are expected to contribute up to 14% of inaris earnings by fy18. besides near-term growth being fuelled by rising mobile device complexity, wider global lte coverage and broader adoption of the iris biometric scanning function, inari also has a foot in the data server business and vertical cavity surface emitting laser packaging should also allow inari to ride on the next wave of laser growth. in 1h17, the groups share price gained 29.63%. affin hwang

price had been expected to climb on proposed corporate restructuring following the appointment of tan sri abdul wahid omar as the chairman of sime darbys controlling shareholder, permodalan nasional

units sometime in 4q17. its share price had gained 16% as at june 30. according to bloomberg data, buy calls on the stock continue to outweigh hold calls by 11 to nine. out of 23 analysts who cover the stock, the consensus tp of 19 of them is rm9.81 per share in sime darby. however, moodys investors service has cautioned that it may downgrade the groups baa1 rating on uncertainties from the spin-offs as this would reduce diversification, scale and cash flow, thereby raising the groups business risks.  by samantha ho   genting malaysia bhd\nalthough genting malaysia bhd ended 1h17 as the second-best performer on the fbm klci with a 20.09% increase in share price, the party may not be over for the gaming counter just yet as more gaming and non-gaming revenue is expected to roll in throughout its upcoming quarters on full operations at its sky plaza. maybank ib researchs samuel yin shao yang lifted earnings estimates by 3% to 6% for the next three years on higher priced meals at sky avenue, a higher average price per ticket at 20th century fox world and a maiden 20th century fox world sponsorship income of some rm50 million effective mid-2017. the research house upgraded its call from hold to buy and the counters tp by 14% to rm6.15 from rm5.40, with earnings expected to grow in 3qfy17 supported by the opening of vip rooms and 250 suites at the sky plaza, genting highlands premium outlet and the theme park hotel. we also understand that most sky avenue tenants will begin paying rent in 3qfy17 after their rent-free period expires, yin noted. the 12-month consensus tp from 20 analysts is rm6.15, with seven having a buy call and 11 analysts having a hold call, while two are telling clients to sell the stock.  by samantha ho   ta ann holdings bhd\nexpected to see a turnaround in 2017, ta ann holdings bhd was the worst performer in 1h17 among the 10 stock picks as its share price fell by 10.4%. instead of bottom fishing, the experience of holding ta ann shares for investors would probably feel more like catching a falling knife instead. nonetheless, analysts remain positive about the company, with bloomberg compilation showing a 12-month tp of rm3.93, indicating an upside of 11.3%. however, of nine analysts, only two of them have a buy call with the rest recommending to hold. midf research recommended a buy call with a tp of rm4.30, which represents 21.8% upside to ta anns 1qfy17 core net income of rm42.2 million, which was above expectations. alan lim, the analyst from midf research, said that the strong result was caused by stellar performance of the plantation division as 1qfy17 fresh fruit bunch (ffb) production growth came in stronger than expected at 20% year-on-year to 148,715 tonnes. while the kl plantation index gained 3.9%, ta ann saw its share price fall by 10.4%. recall that the group also saw a lacklustre year in 2016 when its share price fell by 5.58%. lim said the recommendation being upgraded to buy was due to an expectation of plantation divisions earnings growth to remain strong on high ffb volume seen at 10%, the timber division to remain profitable due to support from high export log prices and it is a key laggard among plantation stocks.  by billy toh   protasco bhd\npicked as one of the construction players that were expected to benefit from the governments spending on infrastructure building, protasco bhd had not been up to the expectations, at least in terms of share price. the stock dropped nearly 8% in 1h17. nonetheless, the company saw its joint venture with kumpulan perangsang selangor bhd awarded a rm174.4 million contract for the proposed infrastructure works at pulau indah industrial park, which are for 18 months and scheduled for completion in january 2019. jeremy goh, an analyst with hong leong investment bank (ib), shared that protasco has a letter of intent for phase three of the 1malaysia housing project for civil servants in putrajaya. other than a potential election play, protasco also has a strong defensive nature for a construction player with its dividend yield of about 5.7%. hong leong ib has a tp of rm1.20 for protasco, indicating an upside of 14.3% based on its close last thursday.  by billy toh   sapura energy bhd\no&g services provider sapura energy bhd, previously sapurakencana petroleum bhd, saw its share price take a beating after reporting a 75% slump in its net profit for 1qfy18. a low oil price environment and worsening rig utilisation also did not help. its share price had seen a drop in profitability amid higher taxation. its revenue took a hit in 1qfy18, falling 9% on lower contributions from the drilling and exploration segment and the production segment. the results sent its share price down to rm1.57  the lowest level since early december last year. it closed at rm1.65 last friday, trading at a forward per of slightly more than 40%, according to bloomberg. bloomberg data indicates that a higher number of analysts  now seven  has a buy call on the stock compared with the five that recommended adding it at the beginning of the year. however, six analysts downgraded the stock within the past two months, lowering the consensus tp to rm3.19.  by samantha ho   classic scenic bhd\nwhile classic scenic bhd underperformed against the fbm klci, the company has proven to be a resilient counter that is suitable for a defensive strategy with a high dividend yield of about 6.04%. the wooden picture frame makers share price increased by 1.68% in 1h17. its latest quarterly financial results showed a 12.2% decline in net profit to rm3.7 million for 1qfy17 from rm4.2 million in the corresponding quarter a year ago, mainly attributed to a varying product mix and higher cost of labour and operating expenses as a result of lower fair value gain from foreign currency forward contracts. the company is primarily involved in the manufacturing and export of high-end wooden picture framework mouldings and about 90% of its sales come from the export market, mainly to the us and are denominated in us dollars. classic scenic continues to remain one of the best defensive counters given the strong balance sheet, with its net cash standing at rm26.4 million or 21.9 sen per share at end-march, an increase from rm23.9 million in 2016. the group also has a good track record of generous dividend payout. in 2016, classic scenic paid a total of 11 sen per share for dividends, up from 10 sen per share a year ago. insiderasia, which remains positive about the company, estimated a total dividend of 13 sen to 14 sen per share for 2017, giving an above-market average yield of above 7%. by billy toh   gamuda bhd\ngamuda bhd, whose shares soared 14.29% year-to-date to close at an eight-year high of rm5.50 per share, still appears to be riding on a wave of optimism towards the construction sector ahead of the upcoming elections. widely held as a proxy for the sector and beneficiary of expected infrastructure jobs to be awarded, the counter still commands a buy call by 18 out of 23 analysts covered by bloomberg data. the consensus tp is rm5.93 per share by 20 out of 23 analysts. cimb research kept the counter as its top pick as a beneficiary of the rail theme, with hong leong investment bank agreeing that gamuda would ride on upcoming mega rail projects such as the kuala lumpur-singapore high-speed rail, light rail transit line 3 and east coast rail link. meanwhile, affinhwang capital research had cut its earnings forecast by 5% to 6% to reflect lower property earnings and higher tax rates. however, it raised its tp for the stock to rm5.94 per share and highlighted that the group targeted a higher new contract target of rm10 billion from rm3 billion to rm4 billion this year. property sales recovered for gamuda in 3qfy17 at rm620 million compared with rm575 million in the year before. net profit had been on a climb over the past three quarters to rm170.93 million in 3qfy17. the group also announced that it would be paying a second interim dividend of six sen per share on july 28. by samantha ho\n"}, "48": {"date_posted":

when bermaz auto bhd released its full-year earnings on june 13, the market reaction was lacklustre. from its closing price of rm2.02 that day, the stock retreated further to rm1.96 last wednesday  a one-year low. the market indifference is despite an inherent yield play, given that the mazda car distributors dividend payout is expected to remain high for several financial years ahead. in addition, the tide is seen to be turning for the company after two consecutive financial years of earnings decline. many analysts are recommending the stock as they are upbeat about its prospects but some fund managers have a more cautious stance in view of weak car sales. net profit for the financial year ended april 30, 2017 (fy2017) fell 39.7% year on year to rm119.05 million amid a 20.8% decline in revenue to rm1.66 billion, bermaz auto said on june 13. it attributed the drop in profit to lower turnover and margin compression due to the persistent weakness of the ringgit against the yen. however, earnings are expected to pick up in fy2018 in what would be the first uptick since fy2015, according to analysts. a median estimate from six research houses compiled by bloomberg forecasts net profit rebounding 57% y-o-y to rm187.17 million, with individual estimates ranging from rm152 million to as high as rm201 million. notably, for fy2017, bermaz auto declared a total dividend of 11.65 sen, representing a 112% payout versus its earnings per share of 10.37 sen. in a june 14 note, uob kay hian estimates the payout to be at 105% for fy2018 and 80% in both fy2019 and fy2020, citing the companys strong net cash position of rm185.9 million and an asset-light business model. the high payout will likely continue for awhile since the management buyout was financed by debt, says an analyst when contacted. to recap, last july, bermaz autos senior management completed a management buyout that saw them and former major shareholder berjaya corp bhd consolidate their collective 31.88% stake in a special purpose vehicle (spv), dynamic milestone sdn bhd. the management team controls 66.7% of the spv. to make up the valuation difference, given berjaya corp had 21.88% equity interest in bermaz auto compared with their 10%, the senior management also paid rm406 million in cash raised via financing. dynamic milestone retains 17.11% as at the latest annual report. bermaz auto had yet to respond to queries from the edge at publication time as the senior management is overseas. that said, the yield play has been known for a while, a fund manager says, explaining why the market had not reacted much to the anticipated high dividend payouts. in addition, a soft domestic auto market means the sector is not very attractive to most investors anyway, he adds. however, prolonged weakness may represent an entry point for investors late to the story. in fy2018, six research houses surveyed by the edge expect full-year dividend per share (dps) of between 11.3 sen and 17.1 sen. going by last wednesdays closing price of rm1.96, the expected fy2018 dps implies yields of between 5.77% and 8.72%. benchmarked against the same closing price, the fy2019 dps expectations from the six research houses imply potential yields ranging from 6.07% to 10.46% for fy2019. all in, even with the weak car sales volumes, earnings growth will be supported by high potential value to be unlocked with the proposed listing of its philippines subsidiary where robust growth in the automotive market is anticipated, plus higher average selling price of around 4% for mazda 2017 variants, kenanga research says in a june 14 note. six of 11 analysts tracking the counter have buy calls, while the rest have a hold. the target prices among the buy ratings range from rm2.15 to rm2.50.  special dividends likely the proposed listing of the companys 60%-owned bermaz auto philippines is expected to take place within the first three months of 2018, raising about rm82 million for its philippines expansion. an analyst opines it may likely lead to special dividends of about two sen per bermaz auto share in fy2018. locally, bermaz auto may get a boost from the rollout of an all-new mazda cx-5 by 2qfy2018. to recap, sales incentives to dealers ahead of the roll-out had compressed earnings before interest and tax margins in 4qfy2017, bermaz auto said on june 13. analysts expect the new cx-5 to boost sales significantly as the model has been a strong performer historically, making up around 35% of bermaz auto sales volume in fy2017. bermaz auto is also expected to roll out the mazda cx-9 this year. with the new cx-5 targeted to be launched only by october this year, bermaz auto would likely see another two quarters of low operating margins before seeing some recovery, maybank research said on june 14, adding that the new cx-5 should lift group revenue as well as associates income as this new model is also earmarked for exports. the export push is part of mazda motor corporations regional goal of boosting sales in asean. in the financial year ended march 31, 2017, the japanese carmaker reportedly sold 100,000 cars in the region and aims to increase that to 150,000 over the next two financial years. bermaz auto owns a 30% stake in mazda malaysia sdn bhd, the local assembler of mazda vehicles. mazda motor owns the remaining 70%. bermaz auto also owns 29% in inokom corp sdn bhd, which undertakes contract assembly for mazda vehicles. we expect associates contribution (to bermaz auto) from mazda malaysia and inokom to improve dramatically as mazda malaysia begins its export activities in july 2017, ta securities noted on june 14. for perspective, the share of income from associates came to rm14.03 million in fy2017. an analyst the edge spoke to opines this may double over the next year barring unexpected headwinds. that said, a possible weakening of the ringgit against the yen remains the key risk for bermaz auto. the exposure comes from its purchase of completely built-up models for sale, which made up 61.3% of overall sales volume in fy2017.

other regions. china, south korea and taiwan are expected to play a big part of this growth. future drivers such as the one belt, one road initiative may lead to even stronger returns.  asian equities will continue to outperform in the second half of the year, due to accommodative monetary policies, robust consumption in domestic demand, strengthening currencies and progressive opening of trade channels in the region. according to an economist and investment experts, future drivers such as chinas one belt, one road (obor) initiative may lead to further growth in the region, including malaysia, resulting in better prospects for investment returns going forward. danny chang, head of managed investments and product management at standard chartered bank (m) bhd, says the bank will continue to favour equities in the region, especially with the market leaning towards a growth scenario. in general, asian companies have been producing capital gains of 2% to 3% this year. including dividends, these assets have provided returns of almost 10%. because of this, we are still overweight on asian equities. india outperformed in the first half of the year, therefore we have taken the gains off the table and are now biased towards northeast asia, towards countries with strong technology industries, such as south korea, taiwan and china. we are positive on these countries given the earnings growth recovery and attractive valuations. on a sectoral basis, we are constructive on chinas new economy, which focuses on e-commerce. earnings growth and valuations of companies in technology and related services are also higher than the broader market. asian equities have done well in the past six months. according to bloomberg data, the india nse nifty 50 index, taiwan stock exchange weighted index, shanghai stock exchange composite index and south koreas kospi index had risen 19.07%, 23.54%, 7.90% and 21.50% respectively over a one-year period as at june 6. economies

peng, head of equity strategies and advisory at affin hwang asset management bhd, says the prospect of more china investments will fuel growth as the country is now ready to exert its influence with initiatives such as obor. as prior concerns over a hard landing for its economy recedes, we think this could be the tide that lifts all boats and positively spills over to other asian markets as well. for the first time in five years, there is a positive earnings rerating for asian markets, with positive sales surprises from south korea, taiwan and china. in 2013, china president xi jinping proposed the obor initiative as a new economic framework that would connect the countrys silk road economic belt project in central asia with its maritime silk road through bodies of water. spanning more than 68 countries, the initiative represents 40% of global gross domestic product and involves more than 60% of the worlds population. according to a may 15 report by uk-based specialist investment banking provider exotix partners, the obor initiative will potentially create sustainable demand for chinese goods, which could help underpin its economic growth and foreign exchange rate in the long term. the initiative will also undoubtedly improve access to capital for countries with underdeveloped political and economic governance, such as those where sufficient domestic and foreign capital have not been mobilised to construct and maintain adequate public utility infrastructure. on may 14, china hosted the obor summit, calling for investment and support from asean countries. although it may not be immediate, the initiative will benefit assets in the region, among other positive implications, says chang. lim suet ling, executive director and ceo of uob asset

sectors such as utilities, sanitation, transport, education and tourism gain from the opening economy. thailand especially will strongly benefit from the initiative as it is strategically located in the middle of asean, sharing borders with myanmar, vietnam, cambodia and laos. since it is very difficult to play within these countries small and illiquid stock markets, an alternative for investors would be to invest in thai companies with exposure to these countries. china has committed rmb780 billion (rm490 billion) via state funds and banks for the first stage of the initiative. lim says that the country wants to continue using the renminbi in the initiative as an attempt to internationalise the currency. currently, projects are being evaluated and there will be a call for tenders to start building the infrastructure. that is where the companies of different countries, including malaysia, will bid for projects. when we get the projects that we bid for, they flow to the bottom line. but this is something that will take time, spanning years of development before we can see the impact, says lim. according to an estimate by the asian development bank, the obor initiative will need an annual infrastructure investment of us$1.7 trillion until 2030. lim says as long as there is investment in the region, jobs will be created, giving people in countries such as bangladesh and pakistan a higher quality of life. this will have a multiplier effect on consumer discretionary products in the region. from a global perspective, financial markets around the world have been leaning towards a reflationary scenario since january, and there is a possibility that the markets may go back to the structurally low-growth scenario, also known as the muddle-through scenario, says chang. most of the soft economic data such as consumer and business confidence seems to be supporting the reflation scenario coming true while only some of the hard economic data such as us jobs are supporting it, to some extent. that is why investors need to be mindful that there are economic data suggesting the possibility of a return to the muddle-through scenario or hanging in between these two scenarios, he adds.  therefore, we think it is best for investors to stay exposed and balanced in this environment to prepare for both possibilities. this means a balanced allocation of 60% equities and 40% bonds, depending on the investors risk profile. lim concurs, saying the data point towards a stalled reflation scenario. however, to take advantage of it, she says investors should go for earnings per share growth in equities instead of focusing on fixed income, which is currently providing low interest rates. at one point in the past 12 months, the 10-year us treasury rate went to a high of 2.6% to 2.7%. the market was expecting it to reach 2.9% if there was a pickup in inflation, but now it is hovering at 2.2%. it is very low and the yield curve is flat. while it is not showing recession, it is showing a stalled reflation, says lim. on the flip side, the earnings yield is growing around 5% to 6%, with the spread close to 400 basis points. as much as bonds are a safe asset with lower volatility, investors need to ask themselves whether it is worth the allocation with just over 2% interest rate. what they can do instead is look for equities that give higher income. these assets are able to provide 3% to 4% even without taking in potential capital gain. as long as the equities are fundamentally strong and the cash flow is strong, it is definitely something that investors can look into to implement a balanced allocation between fixed income and equities. economic outlook this year, global activity has improved amid a cyclical recovery in trade. according to an april 12 report by the world trade organization, global trade will likely expand within a range of 1.8% to 3.6% this year, compared with a very weak 1.3% last year. investments have risen following more upbeat business sentiment and improved corporate profits and industrial activity. in the us, markets have dialled back expectations of president donald trumps ability to carry out his policy reforms. according to julia goh, economist at united overseas bank (m) bhd, the year started full of enthusiasm for a stronger us dollar against a backdrop that the federal reserve will continue its well-communicated policy normalisation of a few interest rate hikes during the year. however, as the year progresses, things have continued to be increasingly challenging for trump as his administration is increasingly distracted by political troubles while making little headway into tax, infrastructure and other fiscal reforms. as a result, the dollar has pared all of its post-2016 us presidential election gains, she says. due to the lack of concrete details regarding trumps fiscal measures, the us dollar index fell to its lowest year-to-date (ytd) level in april. in a may 26 report by rabobank financial markets research, political scandal surrounding the us president, the difficulties associated with the passage of healthcare reform, the lack of details in the tax reform proposal and the white houses budgeting errors have all sapped the belief in the administrations ability to boost economic growth, souring the dollars outlook. although the trump administration is expected to eventually get some of the expansionary economic and fiscal policies approved, the timeline is highly uncertain and delayed, says lim. our current view is if trump is going to push for anything, it will most probably happen by the end of the year or next year. going forward, market sentiment and currencies may still be swayed by the feds tapering of its more than us$4.5 trillion balance sheet. while it depends on what fed chair janet yellen announces, we are seeing the central banks reaction as very conscious of its impact on the market. in our view, the fed will do a very gentle withdrawal of liquidity, slowly reducing the balance sheet. with the balance sheet tightening, the current 10-year us treasury rate of 2.2% may be closer to 2.6% by year end. goh says fears of political and economic uncertainty in europe have been eased by the victory of centralist emmanuel macron in the french presidential election. the eurozone is seeing more support from investment and consumption while the unemployment rate has fallen to an eight-year low  giving a boost to the regions sentiment. due to the stability and growth that exceed expectations in the first half of the year, uobam is currently overweight on europe, says lim. now that there is more stability in the region, the only challenge is britain. when theresa may called for an election on april 18, the conservative party was leading with quite a high margin over the labour party. but this has apparently been narrowing over time. we may see a hung parliament in britain. in the second half of the year, there are germanys and italys elections to watch for, while the brexit negotiations will officially begin after the uk election on june 8. we are cognisant of the upcoming italian election in 2018. although the french election reduced the risk of euro-sceptic parties assuming power, the italian polls remain due next year and are still uncertain. italy is the next hot spot where the sceptics will focus on the potential of anti-establishment parties gaining popularity, resulting in anti-euro policies or moves, says chang. meanwhile, malaysia is seeing an improvement in its economic fundamentals, buoyed by strong domestic consumption and export numbers, says gan. despite the higher inflation and high household leverage, the country saw robust private consumption in the first quarter of the year, growing 6.6% year on year, he adds. we think the markets are also bracing for a pre-election rally in the country and could see more pump-priming ahead of the 14th general election. we expect the fbm klci to breach 1,800 points by year end, if not higher, says gan. the fbm klci closed at 1,788 points on june 6, having risen 12.18% over a one-year period and 9.09% since the start of the year. the index was charging towards an all-time high of about 1,900 points in 2014 before the collapse in oil prices. we would only turn more cautious when the election is called as there is no certainty that the positive economic agenda, moderate politics and anti-corruption drive will be carried through after the election, says gan. meanwhile, the ringgit has strengthened over the past few months, riding the weakening us dollar and upswing in sentiment on the local currency. according to goh, the ringgits strength can prevail if the risk sentiment remains positive and inflows sustain, which could translate into higher or stable foreign holdings of malaysian equities and bonds. we had some initial reservations surrounding the impact of the fed balance sheet reduction on the us dollar and asian currency movements. however, it appears that if the feds actions to taper its balance sheet are well communicated and absorbed by the financial markets, the dollar may not move in such big ranges that allow further ringgit strength, she says. according to chang, the ringgit is one of the most undervalued currencies in asia, taking into account the countrys foreign direct investments. at this juncture, malaysias exports are more than its imports, but they are still very small. meanwhile, the government budget is in a small deficit of about 3%. therefore, unless the budget deficit shrinks significantly  either the government cuts back on spending, we pay a lot more in taxes or exports go up significantly  there will be very little immediate strong impetus to drive the ringgit below rm4 against the greenback. prospective returns and bright spots after three years of anaemic results, the return of growth has resulted in money flowing back into equities globally. with the rise of animal spirits in the markets and easing of fears over the us political turmoil and french and dutch elections, stock markets across the globe rallied, with the ftse 100, germanys dax and s&p 500 reaching record highs in the past 12 months, says gan. meanwhile, investors of high-yield bonds have made good returns over the past 12 months, earning more than 10% in capital gains and coupons. in the coming year, however, the capital gains will be harder to come by, says chang. the current spread for bonds is still very tight. investors will most likely be clipping coupons in the next 12 months. however, not all bonds are created equal. while investors may want to avoid long-dated government bonds, they may want to look at shorter-term us dollar emerging market (em) sovereign bonds, which are currently suggesting value, he says. in terms of commodities, uobam currently has a positive outlook on crude oil, says lim. citing analyst views, she says there is a chance for the commodity to move towards us$60 per barrel from us$47 currently. opec just agreed to reduce production in april. as crude oil takes about 53 days to reach the us storage, the deficit in supply and demand will result in inventory drawdowns in the us in the coming months. this will be reflected in the trading prices, says lim. analysts are positive that crude oil may move towards us$60, which may be good for malaysia because people tend to view the country as an oil exporter. in the shorter term, investors may want to play in this area by taking up oil and gas-related stocks. chang says stanchart has a slightly upwards bias towards oil and is expecting the opec cutback to have a positive effect on trading prices. while we think that it may be more than us$60, an outlook of us$70 or us$80 may be unlikely. sector-wise, the banking sector in developed markets is looking attractive, with the possibility of a widening profit margin in the event of a rising bond yield curve. in malaysia, the banking and property sectors are poised for a turnaround after recent lacklustre performances, says gan. banks have embarked onaggressive cost-cutting exercises and we are starting to see the results this year, with a recovery in top-line growth and better earnings. maybank, hong leong bank and public bank posted good returns and we believe there is a potential rerating catalyst with the improving business environment, he says. banks are leveraged to the economy. with improving fundamentals and positive macrodata, the rest of the sector should catch up on more attractive valuations and better earnings growth. meanwhile, in the local property sector, counters are due for a late cycle upturn after three years of softness, says gan. although not expecting significant price improvements, better sales volumes may be achieved in the coming months, he adds. with the general election looming, we believe there is an incentive for the government to loosen lending policies, including the real property gains tax and stamp duties. this will give the sector a boost as 60% of household wealth is tied to property. we think the downside is also limited as the prices of property stocks have not moved a lot and are supported by a 30% to 40% discount to their fair value, says gan. other attractive sectors in the country include those that will benefit from election pump-priming such as consumer-driven sectors as well as those set to benefit from increased spillover investments from china, such as the construction sector. while defensive, non-cyclical sectors such as utilities and consumer retail may be ideal in a muddle-through environment, these sectors may not be very exciting in a growth-chasing scenario, says chang. lim concurs, saying that it is structurally very challenging for the defensive sectors to outperform in the current environment. diversification alternatives although things are looking up with prospects of better returns for traditional asset classes, investors should still consider alternative assets to diversify their portfolios, says chang. while it is all right to have about 5% allocation to illiquid alternative investments such as wine and art, i believe that investors should focus on liquid alternative investments such as exchange-traded funds (etfs) and mutual funds. hedge funds are also an alternative investment to consider, says lim. these funds are meant for hedging. therefore, they are a long-shot investment. while they are slow moving, they will give investors extra alpha. however, it is crucial that they know what they are buying into. they must identify the fund benchmark and its volatility before deciding on the allocation of investment into any of the funds. she adds that sophisticated investors may want to look at private equity and venture capital, which can give substantial returns. however, as the investments are highly risky and illiquid, investors should make sure they are comfortable with the fund managers track record before putting their money into any funds or companies. an interesting asset class that is underappreciated and may be worthy of a place in an investors portfolio is em equities, says chang. asian equities, which have been doing well, are a significant component of em equities, which include stocks in latin america, the middle east, africa and eastern europe. the divergence of equity valuations between developed market and em equities is at its widest level in the past five years. since the taper tantrum, em equities have been neglected by investors. but now, we may see some value in em equities. it is a contrarian idea, but if investors are willing to consider this, then it may prove to be an interesting diversification to their portfolios, says chang. having said that, clients should be rightsizing their portfolios. em equities should not take up 50% of their allocation, but 15% to 30%. additionally, to normal malaysian investors, em stocks may be an uncharted territory. therefore, it is best for them to invest through a manager, perhaps through an etf or managed fund, because that is significantly diverse. since you are playing the initial updraft, the index will get carried upward. you may not make as much from an individual stock, but it is a good way to participate in em assets."}, "53":

that only caters for bumiputeras. the group hopes to gain more customers by introducing modern, culturally diverse products. we are trying our best to portray ourselves as a developer for all, says group managing director datuk ahmad abu bakar. i think the public still has the perception that we are subsidised by the ministry of finance, when in fact we are financially independent and do not receive grants for our projects, although we are 100% [owned by the ministry]. nonetheless, this perception is slowly changing, says ahmad. based on our take-up rates and sales lately, we have noticed that there is a wider range of buyers that are opting for our products. we believe we are gaining the confidence of the public. like other developers, we are looking for opportunities to maximise our profit. i believe we are heading towards the direction where our products will fit the needs of the mass market, he declares. uda holdings has a long history in the local property development industry. the urban development authority (uda) was first established by the government on nov 12, 1971, to spearhead the nations planned urban development. subsequently, uda holdings was formed on july 14, 1999, and listed on the main board of the kuala lumpur stock exchange on nov 19 the same year. about 50% of uda holdings shares were acquired by khazanah nasional bhd in 2004. the shares were transferred to the ministry of finance in 2008. the group had been placed under the ministry following the dissolution of the ministry of entrepreneur and cooperative development in 2009. some of uda holdings oldest developments  such as pasar besar taman tun dr ismail, hentian puduraya, sinar kota and dataran maybank  are now landmarks. ahmad maintains that the group has become bolder in terms of its developments in recent years. one of its notable ongoing projects is the bukit bintang city centre (bbcc). the rm8.7 billion regeneration of the 19.4-acre pudu jail site in kuala lumpur is being undertaken by bbcc development sdn bhd, a joint venture between uda holdings (40%), eco world development group bhd (40%) and the employees provident fund (20%). ahmad says uda holdings is constantly on the lookout for ways to speed up its processes, and adopt a more progressive work culture. however, these things do take time to cultivate. as at april, uda holdings had a land bank of 1,240 acres (of ongoing and upcoming projects) across all states in peninsular malaysia, with a total gross development value (gdv) of rm19.9 billion. we have acquired an additional 500 acres in pekan [in pahang for an undisclosed amount], says ahmad. we are looking to acquire more land in the klang valley, and for potential partners to work with at these strategic spots. we are also hoping to champion most waqf (bumiputera) land available in these states. uda holdings posted revenue of rm15.8 million as at april. the group also saw unbilled sales of rm472 million  rm264 million for residential and rm208 million for office and retail developments. this year, the company plans to launch rm713.1 million worth of projects at its ongoing and upcoming developments such as anggun residences at jalan sultan ismail and bbcc in kuala lumpur, kampung morten in melaka, and ipoh waqf centre in perak. the group also plans to develop affordable housing  priced below rm500,000  during the current soft market, says ahmad. our aim is to build more quality developments that are targeted at middle-income earners. meanwhile, uda holdings has named legasi residensi kampong bharu in kuala lumpur and swara at kl south in cheras as two of its highly anticipated projects for this year.  swara at kl south the name swara is derived from the word suara (malay for voice) to represent the voice of the new generation. the development represents a fresh point of view, and [the yearning] for a new space by the younger generation, explains ahmad. we are targeting first-time homebuyers who are seeking to buy houses in the southern part of kuala lumpur. swara has a gdv of rm183.4 million and is targeted to be launched in the third quarter. located on a freehold 5.68-acre parcel in bandar tun hussein onn, the 34-storey block will offer 341 residential and four retail units. the development will be made up of mostly 3-bedroom units with built-ups of 900 to 1,500 sq ft each, and priced from rm450,000. set to be completed by the third quarter of 2020, it will have facilities such as swimming pools, a multipurpose hall, cafeteria, gymnasium, amphitheatre and jogging track. swara is located near the bandar tun hussein onn mrt station (expected to be operational in 2018) and has access to five major highways  the cheras-kajang highway, silk highway, besraya highway, middle ring road 2 and south klang valley expressway, says ahmad. amenities nearby include an aeon big, citibank, hong leong bank, sekolah kebangsaan bandar tun hussein onn and smk bandar tun hussein onn.  legasi residensi kampong bharu this rm529 million project is set to become the next commercial hub in kampung baru, kuala lumpur. ground work at the 2.85-acre parcel, which was once the location of the villages sunday market, is progressing smoothly and is about 20% completed. we are positioning legasi residensi as a new landmark for urbanites to own their dream homes, especially in the middle of the city centre and at competitive prices. our prices are lower than those offered by other developers, especially in the golden triangle area, says ahmad. located in jalan raja muda musa, the mixed-use development will have 639 residential units spread across two towers as well as 83 offices and 43 retail units. it is expected to be completed by june 2020. the two 43-storey residential towers will offer a range of units, with built-ups of 807 to 1,907 sq ft. the rumah wilayah persekutuan (rumawip) units are priced at about rm300,000 each, with a 10-year moratorium period. other units, under the open category, have prices ranging from rm1.3 million to rm1.4 million for type a, and from rm716,200 to rm749,600 for type b. the office units are priced from rm1.2 million onwards while the retail units start at rm837,000. for legasi residensi, our target market is young executives, first-time homebuyers, young couples and families, and the bumiputera residents in kampung baru, says ahmad. so far, the response has been good, even though there has not been much publicity about the development since it was launched on jan 24. we have sold 165 out of the 206 units of affordable homes under the rumawip category. we have also successfully sold 45% of the open-category units, he adds. a variety of facilities will be offered, including a convenience store, swimming pool, cafu00e9, gymnasium, nursery, surau, library and multipurpose halls. the maintenance fee will be 30 sen psf. amenities nearby include universiti kuala lumpur, universiti teknologi malaysia, hospital kuala lumpur and suria klcc. the project is connected to the kampung baru lrt station, as well as near the medan tuanku monorail station and heritage area, and is easily accessible via the ampang-kuala lumpur elevated highway (akleh). we are hoping to develop a series of developments based on legasi residensi all over malaysia. we have one called legasi bertam in penang that is in the pipeline, reveals ahmad. located on a 1-acre parcel in bertam, the project has a gdv of rm3.4 million. with an indicative price of rm45,000 per unit, the 80 units (built-ups: 650 sq ft each) will have a similar design concept as legasi residensi.  future plans for the first quarter of next year, we are planning to launch our next project  a redevelopment of kompleks niaga utama in bangsar into fully furnished serviced apartments, reveals ahmad. the project has a gdv of rm277 million and is located in the affluent part of bangsar. further details will be revealed soon, he says. in terms of the property market, ahmad foresees that it will remain stagnant in the next one to two years. as developers, we should step up and build a stronger brand, despite the sluggish market. for uda holdings, we hope to continue to offer more products with long-term values."}, "54": {"date_posted": "20/6/2017", "title": "klci falls 8.19 points; maybank active", "article": " kuala lumpur (june 20): the fbm klci fell 8.19 points

"article": " it is understood that genting power, a unit of genting bhd, is looking to build another coal-fired power plant with a capacity of 680mw in banten, java. this is in addition to its 660mw coal-fired power plant there  via its 55% joint venture pt lestari banten energi  that started operations recently. asked for more details about the proposed new plant, genting says it has no comment at this juncture. it is unclear whether the terms and investment for the 680mw project will be similar to those for its 660mw plant  gentings maiden power venture in indonesia. however, analysts believe it will be, given that it will be in the same area and will have similar capacity. as the 660mw plant started operations in end-march, its revenue contribution will only commence from the second quarter of this year. the cost of this plant, for which construction started in 2013, was us$1 billion. it operates on a 25-year power purchase agreement on a build-operate-transfer basis. genting power is parked under genting energy, which oversees the power and oil and gas businesses of the group. last year, genting effectively had interest in 964mw of net attributable power generation capacity. this was through jointly controlled operations in china and associates in india. gentings total net attributable operating power capacity is expected to increase to over 2,000mw this year, following the commissioning of the 660mw plant in banten and its 1,343mw meizhou wan phase ii in china. in fy2016, the power segments revenue dropped 18% to rm1.01 billion from a year earlier. nevertheless, its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) more than doubled to rm124.2 million. in its 2016 annual report, genting says the lower revenue from the power division was due mainly to lower construction revenue recognised from the lower percentage of completion of the 660mw power plant as it approached completion and commissioning. it adds that the higher ebitda was due mainly to lower construction costs incurred on the power plant in the current financial year.  twentieth century fox theme park opening moved to 2q2018 compared with its other businesses, the power segment continues to be a small contributor for now. its largest contributor remains the leisure and hospitality segment, which registered adjusted ebitda of rm5.35 billion, representing 87% of gentings total adjusted ebitda of rm6.12 billion in fy2016. revenue stood at rm16.5 billion. analysts do not expect the tourism tax, which will come into effect on aug 1, to have much effect on gentings leisure and hospitality business in malaysia  parked under its 49.3%-owned genting malaysia bhd. about 30% of visitor arrivals to the highlands are hotel guests and the rest are day trippers. and about 70% of its 10,000 rooms are under the three-star category, which means only a rm5 tax per room per night. it is unlikely that the tax will impact the demand much, says an analyst who covers the stock. the tourism tax of between rm2.50 and rm20 per room per night is levied depending on the rating of the rooms. the tax for five-star accommodation is rm20; four-star, rm10; and one to three-star, rm5. for non-rated accommodation, including budget hotels, it is rm2.50. on a different note, it is understood that the opening of gentings twentieth century fox theme park, which was originally slated for this year, has been moved to the second quarter of next year. maybank investment bank research and amresearch, in recent reports, say the theme park is now scheduled to open by or in 2q2018. in the first quarter ended march 31, gentings revenue rose to rm4.768 billion from rm4.703 billion. despite the marginal increase in its top line, the groups profit before tax soared 168% to rm1.456 billion from a year before. the increase was due mainly to higher ebitda and a gain of rm302.2 million recognised from the completion of the disposal of

thanks to genting singapore and genting plantations. the research house raised its fy2017 to fy2019 ebitda estimates for genting by 3% to 5%. in our view, genting still has plenty of catalysts. utilising higher target prices for genting malaysia (rm5.40 versus rm5.30 previously) and genting singapore (s$1.25 versus s$1.10 previously) and an unchanged 21% discount to sop/sh valuation (20-year mean), our new sop-based target price is rm11.55 (+9%). in our view, gentings current valuations are attractive at -1sd to lt mean, it notes in a may 30 report. the research house lists the reasons to be optimistic about gentings future: at genting malaysia, sky plaza will contribute on a full-quarter basis from 2q2017; genting highlands premium outlets, 50%-owned by genting plantations, ought to boost visitor arrivals when it opens in mid-june; and theme park hotel will grow its total room inventory about 4% when it reopens by year end. at genting singapore, the redemption of its s$2.3

talks that the company is considering buying into indias direct-to-home business operator reliance digital tv. i read about it in the newspaper, astro group chief executive officer (ceo) datuk rohana rozhan told reporters after the pay tv service providers annual general meeting. as a matter of principle, we dont comment on rumours. pressed on whether astro is denying that it is in talks with reliance digital tv, rohana said: i dont know anything about it and i am the ceo of this company. the times of india newspaper, quoting sources, reported earlier this month that astro was performing due diligence to buy into reliance digital tv, an entity under reliance communications, which is controlled by indian tycoon anil ambani. on the outlook for the year, rohana said astro is being cautiously optimistic about its performance in the financial year ending jan 31, 2018 (fy18), as it is operating in a formidably challenging operating environment. for the first quarter ended april 30, 2017 (1qfy18), astros net profit dropped marginally by 3.14% to rm195.82 million from rm202.17 million a year ago, while revenue was down slightly by 2.69% to rm1.34 billion from rm1.36 billion in 1qfy17. the latest quarterly number was a soft number. it dropped because one of our business-to-business licensing agreement, which was there last year, was no longer in place. so, that was a one-off item, explained rohana. astros results appeared to have fallen largely in line with analyst expectations. according to bloomberg data, 18 out of 22 analysts with a rating on the stock currently have a consensus target price (tp) of rm3, with 11 buys, eight holds and one sell. yesterday, maybank investment bank bhd retained its hold call on the stock, but upgraded its 12-month tp by five sen to rm2.60. meanwhile, cimb investment bank bhd maintained its add rating with an unchanged tp of rm3.25 per share. both research houses cited lower content cost, growing average revenue per unit (arpu) and improved advertising expenditure (adex) as catalysts for stronger earnings for astro from 2qfy18. on adex, rohana said it shrank by 5% in 1qfy18, but it was still better than the industry average of 10%. the advertising income has consistently outperformed the industry average. our guidance this year is that astro will be a growth story, simply because we have started cultivating [a] new revenue stream which has a more immediate effect, she said, adding that astro will deliver top-line growth this year, anchored by adex and online shopping. our adex will start to pick up by around a single-digit growth this year, she added. as for arpu, rohana noted that it has shown an uptick trend, rising by 2% to rm100.8 million in 1qfy18, from rm99 in 1qfy17.\n"}, "58": {"date_posted":

catalysts from an impending rebound in home prices. in may, ura reported developers sold 1,024 private homes and 370 executive condos after aggressive launches in the past two months to capture market exuberance from the first sign of policy easing. this brings total private home sales to over 5,700 units ytd and is on track for maybanks forecast of 10,000 units this year, which will be 25% higher compared to 7,972 units in 2016. we believe robust sales should drive a further decline in unsold stock in the market... the ensuing improvement in inventory-to-sales ratio should allow developers to lift home prices, says analyst derrick heng in a thursday report. mid-to-mass market projects continue to drive sales with 341 and 617 units sold in the rcr and ocr segments. sales remain fairly slow in the luxury segment with 66 units sold in the ccr. cdls project, commonwealth towers, was the third best seller with 53 units sold in the month. uol and cdl with s$9.05 and s$12.05 offer the best proxy to this inflection point, says heng. heng also notices further improvement in sales at the santorini and the alps, two mass market projects located next to cdls recently acquired land parcel in tampines, which could mean less competition when the project gets launched next year. uol's projects principal garden and the clement canopy are also among the best-selling projects. with the pickup in private home sales, heng says developers have turned increasingly positive on the sector's outlook with more aggressive pricing seen at recent land deals. with improving affordability, ample liquidity and a decline in unsold stock, he sees scope for developers to raise prices in the coming year and see escalating land prices as a harbinger of higher home prices. this inflection point

[then], we will have enough buffer should the price of palm oil go down to rm2,000 per tonne again. the rationalisation plan entails the selling of five non-core assets, thp says. but one, thp gemas sdn bhd, has already been sold  for rm152 million last year. the sale included 2,819.27ha in negeri sembilan and a palm oil mill. the other four assets are spread across sabah and sarawak with two earmarked for disposal this year. thp aims to raise another rm150 million this year for its debt reduction programme. according to its 2016 annual report, thp has five subsidiaries in sabah that have assets with a net book value of between rm12.7 million and rm143.35 million. in sarawak, its eight subsidiaries control various assets worth rm30.1 million to rm525.9 million. however, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that to achieve 0.5 times gearing, thp will need to slash an estimated rm400 million off its total borrowings of rm1.29 billion  of which rm1.16 billion are long term  as at its first quarter ended march 31, 2017 (1qfy2017). this implies a mismatch between cash expected to be raised and the amount of debt that thp needs to reduce. among others, this will be bridged by shifting debt to profitable subsidiaries for which the debt was incurred in the first place, thp explains. the whole idea is for their debt to match their cash flow, says chief financial officer mohamed azman shah ishak. recall that thp had embarked on land bank expansion after its listing in april 2006, going from 15,000ha then to 105,000ha at present. this was primarily funded by a war chest of rm1.2 billion from its sukuk issuance, fully subscribed for by its majority shareholder, lembaga tabung haji (th). nearly half of this amount went into the acquisition and development of 80%-owned thp saribas sdn bhd in sarawak, through which thp controls 10,670ha of land under a single title. according to azman, thp saribas is now profitable and has raised its own sukuk financing of up to rm300 million for the debt rationalisation plan. another two subsidiaries are also expected to do the same over the next two years. thp aims to repay rm205 million of its debt by the end of 2qfy2017 via a combination of the thp gemas sale proceeds and funds from thp saribas refinancing. the remaining rm195 million or so will come from the disposal of two units slated for sale this year and the deconsolidation of debt. despite the degearing push and its recent strong 1qfy2017 numbers, thps shares have not seen much excitement. the day after the company released its results on may 23, the stock fell 2.59% to rm1.13. part of the problem may be a lack of liquidity  th holds 73.8% of the company while the employees provident fund owns 6.6%, leaving a free float of about 19.5%. zainal acknowledges the issue. we are going to engage with th to discuss ways and means of improving our liquidity, how to do placements and all that. we have not started that, but definitely we will, he says. the matter is set to be a fine balancing act as lth had pumped a significant amount into thps expansion in previous years. in order to reap returns from its heavy investments, the timing would need to be right. of the three analysts tracking the stock, two recommend a hold and one a sell. target prices range from 95 sen to rm1.22. in a may 25 report, maybank research cites thps high cost structure as a key concern at the moment. it estimates an all-in cost of production of around rm2,200 per tonne for fy2017. however, zainal expects an average cost of rm1,700 per tonne, which is pushed up by the external crops that thp is purchasing to boost the utilisation of its mills at an estimated average cost of rm2,000 a tonne. the expected average cost of its own crops this year is rm1,400 per tonne. looking ahead, the coming financial years may provide that return for thp and its shareholders. the palms in 51% of its planted areas are between four and nine years of age, meaning they will enter their peak production age over the next few years. another 21% are prime mature palms of between 10 and 19 years, which implies that by fy2020, thp would have about 60% of its planted areas in prime mature and mature ages. the upside potential for thp is fairly high, says zainal. in terms of output, we are expecting a 10% to 12% increase in ffb (fresh fruit bunch) production every year for the next three financial years, minimum. this growth projection is on the conservative side, the ceo adds. in 1qfy2017, thp saw a production surge of 17% year on year, which powered an 86% y-o-y increase in revenue to rm166.1 million and a return to the black with a net profit of rm15.2 million compared with a loss of rm9.4 million in 1qfy2016. thp is expecting at least a 10% ffb output improvement quarter on quarter in 2qfy2017. however, the average selling price (asp) realised may be lower than the rm2,997 per tonne achieved in 1qfy2017 as peak production season is kicking off in mid-june. the company had achieved an asp of rm2,463 per tonne in fy2016 and rm2,081 per tonne in fy2015. for the full year, my expectation [of realised asp] is between rm2,500 and rm2,700 per tonne, says zainal. in terms of its six mills, thp is targeting an average utilisation rate of 60% this year. it is also exploring the possibility of divesting up to a 40% stake in its rubber plantation arm, thp-bonggaya sdn bhd, in sabah, which controls 10,117ha under a 100-year lease that expires in 2098. at present, roughly 7,700ha are planted, of which 2,000ha will become available for tapping by 2018. at a book value of rm143.35 million, a 40% stake in the unit may be worth around rm57.34 million. when we go downstream at a later time via a processing factor and so on, we would like to ensure that we have some partners who can take up the volume, zainal says.

officer (ceo) datuk khairussaleh ramli, in an analyst briefing yesterday, said it would be issuing shares for ammbs assets and liabilities, and stressed that there would be no cash involved. this throws up questions as to how ammbs largest shareholder australia and new zealand banking group ltd (anz), which has been looking to sell its 23.78% stake, will exit. anz said last november that it planned to sell its stake over the next 12 to 18 month. an industry observer noted that as much as anz would likely want a cash exit, it would be too costly for rhb. both banks are trading just under one-time book value now, so if a share deal happens at book value, anz and any other shareholder could exit at a later date, the observer opined. khairussaleh told analysts that this was the right time for the two banks to go into a merger, particularly because both are trading at close to their bvs. so, if we can do it at book, that will be great. we minimise goodwill to optimise the financial outcome, he said. an all-share deal would be less dilutive, according to a banking analyst who attended rhbs briefing. they expect to overcome dilution in two to three years, he said. in a report yesterday, dbs group research noted that in may last year, anz wrote down its investment in ammb to 0.9 times bv, which fuelled speculation that anz might be willing to relinquish its stake for as low as one-time bv. sources said there is a strong possibility that the employees provident fund (epf), which is the common shareholder in both banks, will end up being the biggest shareholder of the merged entity. it currently has a 40.7% stake in rhb and 9.91% in ammb. rhb and ammb, in separate stock exchange filings yesterday, said they had obtained bank negara malaysias approval, which is valid until nov 30, to start discussions for a possible merger of their business and undertakings. this confirms a report in the the edge malaysia weeklys march 20 issue that cited sources as saying that the two were exploring a merger and that there had been preliminary talks among some of their key shareholders. the two banks have now entered into a three-month exclusivity agreement, which expires on aug 30, to negotiate and finalise the pricing, structure, and other terms and conditions. they said there could be an automatic extension of the exclusivity period, if needed. it is envisioned that the transaction will effectively be an all-share merger, they said in a joint press statement yesterday. in the statement, khairussaleh said: we are confident that if the proposed merger takes place, it will create greater synergy for the enlarged banking group, benefiting our shareholders, customers, employees and all other stakeholders. he told analysts that the merger would make the group no 1 in asset management, general insurance and equities broking, and no 2 in islamic banking. it would also make it the 9th largest bank by assets in asean, creating a bigger platform for it to grow further at home and regionally. in an email to staff yesterday, khairussaleh stressed that it would be business as usual at rhb. to be able to compete effectively in the banking industry, and provide the platform for future growth, we believe that having scale to our business is key. a merger will help accelerate this objective, he said. should the discussions lead to a merger, he assured the staff that the group would take the necessary steps to ensure a smooth integration of rhbs business and operations with that of ammb. at a town hall meeting with senior staff, he said that if all went well, the parties hoped to get the deal completed within a year. meanwhile, ammb, in its town hall with senior staff, said it would be good for the group to move up in the size rankings. rhb and ammb combined would have total assets of rm365.88 billion, only slightly behind the third largest banking group public bank bhds rm380.05 billion. ammb, on its own, is the sixth largest. this new chapter that is opening in the ambank groups history, comes at an opportune time for us as we have been moving closer to achieving our top 4 goals. i am positive that the proposed merger with rhb will create a stronger business and financial presence. our combined strength in key business segments, particularly in retail and investment banking, will bode well for us as we move forward to achieve our goal of becoming a formidable banking group, its group ceo datuk sulaiman mohd tahir said in the press statement. apart from the epf, rhbs other major shareholders are aabar investments pjs (17.75%) and osk groups tan sri ong leong huat (10.13%). over at ammb, founder and chairman tan sri azman hashim holds a 12.97% stake. he is retiring from all his positions within the group over the next two years, and hence, likely to be more open to paring down his stake. uob kay hian research, in a report early yesterday, opined that the merger would require a fair degree of cost rationalisation given the amount of operational and revenue duplication between ammb and rhb. the combined entity will have 453 branches versus maybanks 363 branches. both banking groups have sizable corporate and investment banking franchise. post merger, rhbs cost-to-income ratio, casa (current account savings account) ratio and loans-to-deposit ratio would deteriorate, given ammbs poorer financial metrics in these areas. in terms of loans profile, rhb would experience a slight uptick in overall consumer loans composition from 46.8% to 49.7%, as a result of ammbs relatively larger auto loans portfolio. given such a scenario, the synergies of the merger will have to come from a cost angle which was a key hurdle to the previous proposed merger between cimb-rhb-malaysia buildings society bhd, it said. both the stocks of ammb and rhb will resume trading today. as the revenue synergies between the two groups are not compelling, we expect the market to react negatively

a steady rally that started last december, cahya mata sarawak bhds (cms) shares tumbled this month. a prolonged share price weakness may present a buying opportunity ahead of an expected pick-up in earnings next year. last friday, the stock closed at rm4.27 per share, down 8.2% from its one-year high of rm4.65 on may 3  retracing part of its 30% rise over the preceding six months. the reversal is partly due to its dismal first-quarter earnings, which missed street estimates and prompted three rating downgrades from seven analysts tracking the company. the retreat puts the stock below most analysts target prices. of the seven analysts, there are two buy and five hold calls. among the hold recommendations, uob kay hian is the most conservative with a rm3.59 price target, followed by dbs vickers rm4.30. the other analysts had prices upwards of rm4.50, with the buy calls at between rm4.66 and rm5.15 per share  implying a potential upside of as much as 20.6% from last fridays close of rm 4.27. for the first quarter ended march 31, 2017 (1q2017), cms posted rm282.3 million in revenue and rm22.7 million in net profit, or just over 9% of consensus estimates, says maybank research. the numbers were dragged by sluggish construction materials sales, which have yet to be boosted by work on the pan-borneo highway. for perspective, in fy2016, cms cement and building materials division, together with trading, made up 73% of total revenue and 70% of pre-tax income. that said, analysts are expecting stronger quarters ahead. uob kay hian thinks the company will do better in 2hfy2017 as building material orders pick up. in a may 16 note, alliancedbs research forecasts earnings per share to rise from 15.7 sen in fy2016 to 19.9 sen this year and 22.3 sen in fy2018. an earnings wildcard would come from associate businesses, maybank research opines on may 18. these include the possibility of om materials sdn bhd  which operates a ferro alloy smelting plant in samalaju and in which cahya mata owns a 25% stake  breaking even earlier than expected, 50%-owned telco infrastructure concessionaire sacofa sdn bhd bagging further telco infrastructure projects, and even possible land sales to boost property earnings, it said. however, the conglomerate can expect an earnings lift-off next year from its main earnings driver, which is the building materials and cement divisions, according to midf research analyst fadhli dzulkifly. for cms, fy2018 will be an inflection year in terms of earnings because of the pan-borneo highway factor as well as the upcoming baleh dam construction, fadhli tells the edge. he says the progress rate of the pan-borneo highway is currently about 5%, meaning the land acquisition and site-clearing works are still ongoing. he expects cms earnings to see a boost from the highway project by mid-2018 after the progress rate hits the mid-teens. cms is the largest supplier of aggregate, cement and other construction materials in sarawak and is seen to reap the lions share of the financial benefits when the road construction and upgrades begin in earnest. that said, the highways project delivery partner, lebuhraya borneo utara sdn bhd (lbu), recently allowed tenderers for the project to nominate their own suppliers for the construction materials amid industry concerns that the job may be too big for local suppliers. this has raised worries that the potential boost for cms may not be as lucrative as initially thought. when contacted, the company dismissed the concerns and says it does not expect to see competition by way of imported cement. cms did explore earlier on with lbu the possibility of it and another group being appointed as a nominated supplier ... so as to reduce the risk of shortages and to better control prices. however, it was decided to leave the supply of such materials to the open market, says cms, adding it believes this decision will not impact cms earnings for many overwhelming reasons. in a brief email reply, cms says the financial cost and logistic challenges make it uneconomical and impractical for contractors to import cement into sarawak. it says most sarawak ports are shallow draft ports, restricting vessel sizes to 10,000 tonnes or less. the cap on shipment volume per vessel would add to logistic costs. it also points to a lack of space near existing ports to set up storage silos for raw cement, which would be necessary to keep transport costs manageable. from the problems of shallow draft ports, a lack of space in adjoining ports to locate silos, and cms capacity to supply current and projected cement demand pan state, we remain confident that imports of cement are unlikely to take place, says the conglomerate. cms adds that at its peak, additional demand for cement for the pan-borneo highway works is likely to absorb 20% of its cement production capacity. at present, cms cement division is only seeing a utilisation rate of 60% to meet a statewide demand of 1.6 million to 1.8 million tonnes. last month, cms group managing director datuk richard curtis said he expected the highway project to require one million tonnes of cement. that said, lbus move to open up the cement procurement aspect means possible opportunities for other local cement producers, such as kuching-based quality concrete holdings bhd and smaller, privately held players. a larger share of the pie for the other local players may be at cms expense. another longer-term catalyst for cms is the upcoming baleh dam, the construction of which is expected to kick off in june 2018. the 188m high concrete rockfill dam is estimated to require 1.2 million tonnes of concrete. the impact on earnings is expected from fy2019 onwards. we believe this would translate into a total of rm400 million of additional revenue to cms over seven years, or rm21.4 million quarterly and rm57 million annually, midf research wrote on may 5. in the interim, however, cms is working on a high-performance cement that may strengthen its dominance in the sarawak market. it tells the edge that it expects to complete trials and receive the requisite approvals by 3q2017 but says it is too early to discuss the potential financial impact. the high-performance cement would use, among other things, a by-product of om materials smelting. midf analyst fadhli feels the new product would entrench cms dominance in the sarawak market, which currently uses only portland cement. it would likely add about rm40 million annually to the topline beginning 2018. at last fridays price of rm4.27, cms had a market capitalisation of rm4.59 billion."}, "65": {"date_posted": "25/5/2017", "title": "klci rises with asian markets on us fed cue", "article": " kuala lumpur (may 25): the fbm klci rose

while it is acknowledged that we have strengthened the foundations of our many organisations, the world races on. if these newfound efficiencies are not rapidly leveraged in our path towards global championship, then the u00adpotential for regression in the way we compete and sustain advantage in markets at home and abroad will u00adremain high. in a digitally driven and fast-converging global economy, not only consumers but also public audiences determine business reputations and market values where performances reflected in stock prices are sometimes beyond the full control of companies and organisations. in the boardrooms of the branded, it is not just stock movements that are being actively tracked today. of equal importance is the impact of social media commentary as a parallel barometer on the health of companies, products and services. given that business agility remains important to corporate success, a critical aspect not yet dominant in our institutional mindset is how to relate business performance with market perception or stock price with consumer sentiment. the solution to strengthening this linkage is brand power  the ability to attract, manage and sustain market support better than the competition. malaysian companies are already strong but when not reinforced with the right foundations, the best of structures can break down. similarly, the strongest of businesses can quickly lose dominance without the support of loyal markets at home and elsewhere. the crucial next step, which will define our future efforts and legacy as a nation, is not just continuous transformation but the bastion of brand power. to effectively compete on the world stage, we need to build the essential pillars of brand building in form (identity), character (credibility) and delivery (experience). in other words, we cannot create brands only at design, marketing or communications level but elevate brand building to the policy level of the organisation to be championed by boards as a business strategy. if the future of any enterprise depends on the growth and retention of favourable markets, why is stronger brand learning and investment not a board policy to be instituted and monitored for strategic impact?  brand-aware, not brand-driven the answer to this question is that most of us are brand-aware but not yet brand-driven. as consumers, when we think of a brand, we recall a visual or a jingle: a name, symbol, tune or a combination of all to identify the producer or retailer of a certain product or service. in their tangible forms, brands are recognised through the familiarity of logos, colours, marketing materials and other physical or digital expressions. however, we also know that a brand is more than just a name and a logo. we connect with the brands we support as we like what we see, what we feel and what we remember in our experience with them better than the others. whether it is a bank, a detergent, a favourite apparel brand, a mobile service provider or the way we choose to transport ourselves, we remain faithful to our chosen brands like timeworn friends through the trust built and the promise of delivery between customer and producer. but what has this brand affinity got to do with the making of malaysias global champions? and why should companies be more brand-driven? consider this. if market goodwill drives bottom-line performances through how consumers applaud and differentiate organisations for their products and services, why is the building of brands (which includes the corporate or institutional brand) not embedded in business policy to guide and converge management thinking within current business planning objectives and processes? and why do we not invest enough in what our consumers see, feel and experience in our offerings, especially in markets populated by those with the power to attract and retain market support? why do we not enhance our competences to confidently enter and grow markets the same way as the branded?  barriers to better branding in malaysia, the barriers to better brand building and goodwill management are many: u2022 absence of essential brand pillars. as a developing economy, there is a tendency to adopt mature-market knowledge and practices to u00adshorten learning curves in everything we do, from strategic planning to production, operations, marketing, distribution and sales. while much of our success has been premised on the production and marketing of goods and services that is comparable to the best in the world, not many have achieved competitiveness through brand power without the convergence of the essential brand pillars  board policy, commitment, investment and knowhow; u2022 stage of market readiness. in transitioning from production to market orientation, there is an urgent need to evolve developed market practices to one that better suits our stage of market readiness for greater brand success. for example, brand responsibility still resides with product development, marketing or communications, and is not yet conceptualised and designed at strategic levels of the organisation. products and services are often developed without brand thinking, thereby negating the effectiveness of marketing and promotional support when it is left too late. finally, brand investments u00adbeyond marketing and advertising are seldom adequate to get the product or service brand right in the downstream phase of marketing and distribution; and u2022 brands as an expense, not strategic assets. without policy-driven investments to u00adensure the evolution of a living brand with the potential to become a market winner, measuring the impact of brand investments on business performance is seldom executed. this constraint continues to hamper better brand thinking and commitments at many of our organisations.  global champions with investment in brand building generally limited to advertising and promotions (a&p), in emerging markets, with the exception of a few in asia  toyota, samsung, sony, honda, hyundai, canon, nissan, panasonic, kia, huawei and lenovo  not many made it to interbrands top 100 as brand-driven global champions last year. in a 2016 regional exploration of consumer u00adattitudes, airasia (41) was the lone made in malaysia brand among asias top 100 brands ranked by global information and insight provider, nielsen. among asias top 1,000 brands in 2016 were maybank (397), mister potato (398), petronas (409), spritzer (470), poh kong (506), malaysia airlines (514), habib (607), boh (608), maxis (636), firefly (713), mamee (730), poslaju (737), cimb bank (741), caring pharmacy (760), celcom (871), bonia (913), digi (914), takaful malaysia (925) and mydin (938). the survey with 6,400 respondents from 13 asian markets (including australia) and across 14 major categories tracked the most popular brands in asia from a consumer perspective. the robustness of the malaysian brand will depend on the brand power of our homegrown champions. twenty-one brands or 2% of the 1,000 most-favoured asian brands is a start but if brand equity (the market value a brand potentially generates) is a significant business performance indicator, then more companies need to be empowered with the knowledge and capability. this is not only to retain the goodwill that drove returns on investments in the past but also to confidently compete for market support in the future. the endgame for malaysia is to champion at least five made in malaysia brands into interbrands top 100 and target 100 placements on asias top 1,000 brands by 2030. targeting 10 global championships and brand positions over 15 years, south korea, starting in the late 1990s, continues to run the fastest and most impressive brand race in asia. with the full commitment of malaysian boards, ceos and u00adrelated stakeholders, we will be able to u00adaccomplish the same, if not more. the sooner we start, the better. yasmin merican is the founder and principal of trax associates. a former ey malaysia partner and global client consultant, she is also the author of the right to brand."}, "67": {"date_posted": "15/5/2017", "title": "this top developer pick has room to keep on running", "article": " singapore (may 15): maybank kim eng is reiterating its buy call on uol as its top sector pick, raising its price target to s$8.30 from s$7.93 to reflect the higher market value of uic and target price of uob. in a monday report, analyst derrick heng says there were no surprises from uols latest results announcement, with the clement canopy enjoying a good launch as well as the renewal of all retail leases due for expiry this year.

us dollar requirements. analysts expect the weak ringgit to weigh on astros margins. maybank investment bank research, in a march 29 report, says it expects ebitda margins to remain compressed due to higher content cost because of the weak ringgit. astro now expects content cost to account for 34% to 36% of tv revenue, up from 33% to 35% previously, the reports says. it adds that astro intends to extract more arpu (average revenue per user) from wealthier subscribers with premium and on-demand content. in fact, astro targets its arpu to grow to rm103 to rm104 this year, it states. the research house has a hold call on the stock with a rm2.55 target price. meanwhile alliancedbs research has a buy call on the stock, with a rm3.15 target price. in a march 29 report, alliancedbs research says, astros resilient results and a significantly-hedged us dollar exposure for fy18 should alleviate investors concerns about potential earnings disappointment due to the weak consumer sentiment in malaysia. with other dividend-paying stocks such as telcos still facing earnings and cash-flow risks, we believe astro is a good alternative for yield-seeking investors. post relisting in 2012, astro has made tv advertising one of its main focus areas to drive revenue growth. due to the wider reach to the mass market with the introduction of njoi and also advertisers adopting a more targeted approach to advertising, astro managed to grow its tv adex by 9%-16% in fy12 to 14 and took market share from media prima. tv adex dipped 2% in fy15 owing to poor consumer sentiment before recovering by 6%-12% in fy16-17. we expect growth to be modest at 4% in fy18f, it adds. astro expects the growth driver for fy2018 to come from higher digital advertising expenditure through increasing viewership of njoi  its subscription-free tv service  which will in turn see a rise in prepaid consumption. in malaysia, it wants to add 400,000 njoi consumers this year. for fy2017, astros net profit

price also responded, gaining 7.44% over three trading days from the closing price of rm1.88 on march 31 to rm2.02 by april 5, though the gains have since moderated. while the sector is not out of choppy waters yet, it is understood that management is expecting conditions to improve significantly by mid-2019 as oil market rebalancing is tipped to soothe cautiousness among oil majors in terms of new capital expenditure. so far, brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, has remained around the us$55 a barrel level for most of the year, despite a brief dip towards us$50 in march. that stability is mainly due to the six-month global output cut led by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries. though the cut will be up for review in may, brent is expected to average us$57 this year, according to a wall street journal survey of 14 investment banks last month. that is just above sapura energys estimate of us$55 per barrel. the improved earnings in fy2017 were mainly from increased contribution from its pipe-laying works for petrobras, which contributed rm280 million last year. sapura energy was also able to trim about rm700 million in costs over the past two years, while analysts say it is pushing for another rm200 million in savings this year. to a lesser extent, the one-off reimbursement of rm37 million for the berantai risk-sharing contract (rsc) cessation in 2qfy2017 also helped, analysts say. out of 20 analysts tracking the group, six have buy calls with one sell rating and the rest hold. the target prices among the buy calls range from rm2.08 to rm2.35.  improved financial health another highlight from sapura energys fy2017 numbers was its improving financial health. that said, analysts say it is not yet plain sailing for the group in the near future. most analysts expect sapura energys earnings to fall in fy2018 before picking up momentum from fy2019 onwards. maybank ib research expects a 23% y-o-y decline in earnings per share from 3.5 sen in fy2017 due to loss of earnings from the berantai rsc. shahril has said in a statement that he expects the challenges to persist in the short term but emphasised sapura energys resilience to weather the turbulence. a key support will come from its strengthened balance sheet and strong cash flow. the financial year just ended saw its net gearing improve from 1.34 times to 1.15 times, thanks to a drastic 180% increase in its cash pile to rm3.52 billion as at jan 31. it achieved free cash flow of rm2.24 billion in fy2017, according to bloomberg data. while short-term borrowings increased from rm2.09 billion to rm3.51 billion over the past year, rm1.1 billion was repaid in february 2017, jpmorgan writes in a march 31 note. the strong cash flow enabled the group to fund its rm390 million capital expenditure in fy2017 internally without drawing down on debt facilities. moving forward, sapura energy has said the trend will continue over the next four years at least, says maybank ib research. this year, sapura energy is looking at about rm1 billion in total capex to drill seven infill wells at the sk 310 b15 field off sarawak. that said, there are potential hiccups ahead. one worry is whether more of its rigs will be idle in fy2018 compared with a 50% utilisation rate at present, uob kay hian says in an april 3 report. by 3qfy2018, rig utilisation may decline further with at least two more rig contracts set to expire. the group is actively securing contracts and guided that 4qfy2018 should see utilisation pick up, but the likelihood of immediate replenishments remains unclear, the research house says. however, management has indicated that it expects to be able to maintain a 50% utilisation rate this year and sees a worst-case scenario of only 5 out of 16 rigs working by the end of the current financial year. in addition, sapura energy is still burning through its order book faster than it is replenishing it, cautions ta securities. as at fy2017, the groups total outstanding order book stood at rm16.7 billion, having added rm6.3 billion in new contract wins. about one-third of the order book amount will be recognised in fy2018. it is understood that the group needs at least rm5 billion in new job wins annually to sustain earnings, and its tender book stands at us$7 billion. on the other hand, sapura energys competitiveness globally bodes well for the group. recall that it added rm6.2 billion to its order book in fy2016, which may indicate its consistency in winning jobs despite the turbulent environment. some 76% of the new job wins came from southeast asia. that highlights how much its earnings profile has diversified geographically amid the oil price downturn since mid-2014. according to bloomberg data, only 39.4% of its turnover in fy2016 came from malaysia, with another 39.3% coming from elsewhere across asia. that represents a considerable shift compared with fy2013, when 81% of its revenue came from the domestic oil and gas sector. its latest foray was into the european market via the rm510 million trans anatolian natural gas pipeline contract won last july. notably, sapura energy is expecting first gas from its sk310 b15 field by end-2017. while the early days of production may not be significant enough to lift earnings, it represents a new growth area coming from a low base. the groups net reserves stand at 243 million barrels of oil equivalents (mmboe), out of which 229 mmboe is for gas. with its more mature oilfields seeing a natural decline, the gas output would replenish its current production rate of about 10,000 barrels of oil per day. overall, the bulls peg sapura energy as the best proxy for the oil and gas recovery story, partly due to its position as the lowest-cost oil producer in malaysia. some feel it remains undervalued, given its price-to-book value of about 0.8 times. sapura energys net assets per share is at rm2.19 with the book value of its oil and gas assets pegged at us$45 a barrel. should oil prices remain steady at current levels for a more sustained period of time, the stock may regain wider favour among investors  only time will tell when.

ailing textile and garment business in the near future. this is in line with the company's plans to diversify its core business to tourism and cultural-related property development, it added. however, yong tai noted it has not entered into any formal negotiation or agreement with any third party recently to dispose of the loss-making textile and garment business held by its wholly-owned subsidiary syarikat koon fuat industries sdn bhd. it was responding to an article entitled 'yong tai expects to exit garment business by june' in the edge financial daily yesterday, which stated the company was in talks with the previous owner of syarikat koon fuat industries to dispose of the unit. china-based fabric manufacturer sinotop holdings bhd wants to dispose of an indirect 35.625% equity stake in suzhou xuande zhifu yihe investment management co ltd equity investment centre (limited partnership) (xuande) at cost, as the investment failed to provide returns. sinotop said its indirect

made available 1.52 billion rights shares for the exercise, on the basis of two rights shares for one existing share held (2-for-1). the property developer had fixed the rights issue price at 10 sen apiece which would see it raise as much as rm151.7 million from the exercise. the cash call was to raise funds for its property development projects, expansion plans, and working capital, as well as to repay its short-term bank borrowings. anzo holdings bhd has responded to the latest unusual market activity (uma) query posed by bursa malaysia, stating that the group is not aware of any corporate development that would have caused it. yesterday, anzo was slapped with the uma query, after its share price plunged by 19.5 sen or 35.14% to 36 sen. this is the second uma query received by the construction and timber product manufacturing group within a month; it was queried on march 28 after the share price jumped to 54.5 sen the previous day from 29 sen on march 13. in its reply today, anzo said that after making enquiries with the directors, major shareholders and any other relevant persons, it is not aware of any corporate development, rumour or report concerning its business and affairs that may have accounted for the uma. vivocom international holdings bhd says it has secured three contract wins with a combined value of rm44.71 million, for the installation of aluminium and glazing works. the company said two of the contracts were awarded by pjd construction sdn bhd, comprising a rm6.01 million contract for design, fabrication, supply, delivery and installation of

decision for an isononanol plant within the pengerang integrated complex in pengerang, johor, for a total investment cost of us$442 million. in a filing with bursa malaysia today, the petrochemical arm of petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) said the project is expected to come on-stream by the second half of 2019 and will be undertaken by a wholly-owned subsidiary. landmarks bhd is proposing a private placement to raise as much as rm36.93 million to revitalise and grow its business through the injection of fresh equity into the group, with an indicative issue price of 76 sen per placement

today with immediate support seen at 1,738 points as sentiment at the local bourse remains bearish. global equity markets and the dollar edged higher on thursday, helped by fresh data showing a tighter u.s. labor market, as investors stayed cautious before the first meeting between u.s. president donald trump and his chinese counterpart xi jinping, according to reuters. key stock indexes in europe and on wall street climbed but a gauge of global equities was little changed, with gains offset by a decline in emerging markets, it said. alliancedbs research in its evening edition yesterday said dampened by the down close in the preceding day, the fbm klci had on april 6 traded marginally lower to 1,738.83 as market participants continued to play on the selling side in anticipation of a lower market. it said under the persistent selling interest, the benchmark index was in the red throughout most of the trading sessions before settling near the days low at 1,739.56 (down 5.11 points or 0.29%). in the broader market, losers outnumbered gainers with 526 stocks ending lower and 452 stocks finishing higher. that gave a market breadth of 0.86 indicating the bears were in control, it said. alliancedbs research said the market saw selling activity again on april 6 with a lower low of 1,738.83. this suggested that market participants were unwilling to play a supportive buying game as the market was seen in need of consolidation after the recent run up to the high of 1,759.76. given the weak buying demand in the area of 1,745 and limited room for an immediate upside potential, market participants saw no good opportunity to establish stock positions at this market level. in other words, market participants would only put their investible money at risk when the trade reward is in their favour, it said. the research house said following the down close on april 6, there should be follow through selling interest again with immediate support at 1,738. it said a fall below 1,738 would see a test of next support at 1,726. the analysis of overall market action on april 6 revealed that buying power was weaker than selling pressure. as such, the fbm klci would likely trade below the 1,738.83 level on april 7, said alliancedbs research. based on corporate announcements and news flow yesterday, companies that may be in focus today could include the following: n2n connect

under the contract inked between pestech (cambodia) ltd (pcl) and alex corp co ltd, pestech said pcl will undertake the design, engineering, manufacturing, installation, testing and commissioning of approximately 220km of a 230kv double-circuit transmission line from stung tatay hydro power plant to phnom penh. it added that pcl will also supply, install and connect two 230kv line bays at stung

place its 3s offerings which cover sales, service and spare parts of yamaha marine outboard motor products. these outboard motor products comprise the whole range of lightweight, heavyweight and portable efficient power outboard motors, said hly marine in a statement. hly marine said its headquarters will be based in sungai buloh, selangor, and would house a central service centre outfitted by ymc. hiap teck venture bhd today clarified that it decided not to extend the deadline to complete its planned share swap deal with an steel international co ltd because negotiations to come to definitive agreements took too long. negotiations had taken more than nine months, it said, and the continued production suspension at its unit, eastern steel sdn bhd, was not in the best interest of the company, it said in a stock exchange filing today. boustead holdings bhd is banking on an anticipated pick-up in local economy, higher government spending and more foreign direct investments for better earnings this year. boustead deputy chairman and managing director tan sri lodin wok kamaruddin, who is expecting a much better year for malaysia, said boustead, as a diversified group, will

bring in more income. malayan banking bhd (maybank) says it is well prepared for the impact of additional provisions that will arise from the adoption of the malaysia financial reporting standard (mfrs) 9 come jan 1 next year. group president and ceo datuk abdul farid alias said that while additional provisions have become a certainty next year, maybank's capital position is sufficient to withstand the collision to profitability. \"the one-off provisions [are] going to result in higher provisions. that is a certainty, but the provisions can be charged off against our capital, that's why our capital is getting higher over the years, we are preparing for that,\" he told reporters after the group's annual general meeting today. mfrs 9 requirements for local banks, for which reporting will commence on jan 1 next year, are based largely on a forward-looking expected credit loss (ecl) impairment model and a substantially reformed approach to hedge accounting. ecl is expected to increase the provision amount required, which will potentially impact banks' profitability. jhm consolidation bhd received an unusual market activity (uma) query from bursa malaysia today, after its share price surged 24 sen or 5.77% this morning. over the past year, jhm's share price has soared almost 10 times from 47 sen. the new tourism tax bill that was just passed could impact and

(see also: singapore banks exposures to ezra lower than expected) in a tuesday report, maybank analyst ng li hiang says that although banks have already classified loans to ezra as non-performing loans (npls) and made provisions for it, there is reason to believe that provisions will remain elevated, while risks of further defaults also remain. however, the rate of new npl formation from the oil and gas (o&g) sector is likely to ease this year as we believe the chunky exposures have been recognised as npls. we currently estimate specific provisions over average net loans to be c.29-37bps across the banks for fy17e, explains ng.  the research house has therefore highlighted dbs as its preferred stock among the banking sector as it remains positive on the banks ability to drive pre-provision profits in the face of asset-quality deterioration, particularly for its o&g industry exposure. dbs has been rated hold at a target price of s$18.13, while ocbc and uob have been given sell and hold recommendations at target prices of s$8.05 and s$19.54 respectively. as at 11am, shares of dbs are trading 0.4% higher at s$19.08. ocbc is up 0.1% at s$9.64, while shares of uob are trading 3 singapore cents lower at s$21.83.

open sometime in january, however the management had wanted to ensure it has all necessary components ready to give maximum impact to its customers. nevertheless, with successful simulation exercise conducted daily on its facilities before opening, the resorts latest casino is expected to open its doors soon. genting malaysia revealed updated figures showing that a whopping 1.19 million passengers had boarded its new 2.8km awana skyway cable system between its official opening on dec 22 last year and feb 28. since the awana skyway began operations on dec 22, it has transported on average 10,000 to 12,000 passengers daily. the new skyway saw a record 42,000 passengers a day during the recent chinese new year holiday, compared with about 30,000 passengers a day on the genting skyway during the same festive period last year. genting malaysias stock has been on an upward trend since the end of last year  around the same time awana skyway and sky avenue mall opened. the stock rose 21.6% in just over two months. from a close of rm4.48 on dec 23, 2016, the stock has been rising steadily to close at a historic high of rm5.45 on march 6. the share price has since softened to close at rm5.35 last thursday. some 30% of analysts covering the stock polled by bloomberg recently downgraded their calls on genting malaysia to hold or neutral. those with hold calls say the fairly large uptick in the share price has already factored in genting malaysias near-term growth prospects and the upside potential has narrowed. nevertheless, they are still positive on the upcoming full launch of its genting integrated tourism plan (gitp). in its response to the edge, genting malaysia says the rm10.38 billion gitp is progressing smoothly, as seen with the opening of key projects such as the awana skyway cable system. the system has 99 gondolas, 10 of which have glass floors, and travels at a top speed of 6m per second. the ascent from the awana station at the awana transportation hub to the skyavenue station at the resort takes only 10 minutes. halfway through the ride, there is an option to stop at the chin swee temple station. with a capacity of 10 persons per gondola, the awana skyway can transport up to 3,000 passengers per hour each way, it says. visitors who disembark at level 4 of the skyavenue station can easily access top retail and restaurant brands from around the world at the skyavenue mall, which has a net lettable area of 600,000 sq ft. the brand-new mall has been designed for those who seek out new experiences in leisure, food and entertainment, particularly gen ys, millennials and young families. currently, only level 1, which is designated for food and beverage, and the high street fashion floor on level 3 are open. the other floors will open in stages. some of the top f&b brands brought in by resorts world genting are burger & lobsters, cafu00e9 richard and motorino as well as tampopo, kyochon 1991 and dragon-i. fashion brands include joy & peace, thomas sabo and loccitane. last year, resorts world genting had 20.2 million visitors, translating into 4% growth from 2015. about 71% of total visitor arrivals were day-trippers and 29% were hotel guests. last year, the occupancy rate at rwgs hotels stood at 93%. for its financial year ended dec 31, 2016 (fy2016), genting malaysia saw its revenue rise 6% year on year to rm8.93 billion. net profit soared 125% to rm2.8 billion from rm1.24 billion in 2015. the jump in earnings was partly due to the rm1.27 billion gain on the disposal of its genting hong kong shares. carving out the one-off gain from its investment, earnings were higher, at rm1.53 billion, compared with rm1.24 billion in 2015. the board declared a special single-tier dividend of 7.3 sen per share

the special dps and remain bullish on gitp, we opine that the risk-reward profile for genting malaysia is balanced after its share price rallied 19% year to date. we leave our fy2017/fy2018 estimates largely unchanged but trim our sum-of-parts valuation by five sen to rm5.30 to account for the special dps. we downgrade genting malaysia to hold only because upside potential has narrowed, says

although we remain upbeat on the gitp programme, the recent strong share price performance, which rallied 19% ytd, may have already priced in the positives. thus, we downgrade the stock to market

(bursa has 927 companies in total. the remaining 119 have different fiscal year-ends.) according to data compiled by the edge, 440 companies reported better year-on-year financial performance for 4q2016 while 368 reported the converse. of the 440 that performed better, 273 posted higher profits, 101 returned to the black while 66, though they still lost money, narrowed their losses. as for those that fared worse than a year ago, 209 reported lower profits, 91 slipped into the red while 68 saw wider losses. so, of the 808 companies, 583 are profitable while 225 are loss-making. overall, the situation is positive  unless, of course, the remaining 119 companies (13% of public limited companies) post poor 4q results later this month. this is consistent with aggregate headline corporate earnings (including extraordinary items), which grew 7% year on year to rm20.5 billion in 4q (see charts). note that these figures are based on only those companies that have reported their 4q results. when the figures of the remaining 119 are included, total corporate earnings are likely to be higher than rm20.5 billion. it is also worth noting that total corporate earnings contracted for four consecutive quarters  from 3q2015 to 2q2016  before growing in 3q and 4q last year. excluding those that have not reported their 4q results, sectors that pulled up corporate earnings are banking, conglomerate and hospitality. malayan banking bhd, the countrys largest lender, saw its net profit jump 43% to rm2.36 billion in 4q, buoyed by an improvement in revenue from a pick-up in loans as well as a robust fee income and underscored by disciplined cost management that resulted in a smaller rise in overhead expenses. hong leong bank bhds net profit rose as well, by 60% to rm549.94 million due to higher net income, lower operating expenses and lower charge on allowance for impairment losses on loans, advances and financing (see have banks traded ahead of fundamentals? on page 10). conglomerate sime darby bhds net profit more than doubled to rm644 million, driven by its plantation division, which benefited from an increase in crude palm oil prices and higher fresh fruit bunch production. in the hospitality sector, genting malaysia bhd saw a fourfold increase in net profit to rm1.69 billion while genting bhds net profit surged 237% to rm1.14 billion. note that there is double counting here as genting controls genting malaysia, whose earnings were boosted by a rm1.27 billion gain from the sale of its 16.8% stake in genting hong kong ltd to golden hope ltd. as for the oil and gas sector, downstream players benefited from recovering crude oil prices while upstream players that provide support services registered larger impairment losses. the sectors that dragged down corporate earnings were healthcare and telecommunications.  best performers oil and gas downstream thanks to higher oil prices, downstream players, such as petrol retailer petronas dagangan bhd (petdag), shell refining co federation of malaya bhd, petron malaysia refining & marketing bhd and gas malaysia bhd, saw their combined earnings almost triple to rm633.5 million in 4q, up from rm215.1 million a year ago. dated brent has recovered gradually, rising to an average of us$54 per barrel at end-2016 from as low as us$31 per barrel at the start of the year. petdags net profit soared 183% to rm261.49 million  mainly due to improved margins from petrol  in line with the upward trend in means of platts singapore prices in the second half of last year. shell posted a 115% rise in net profit to rm207.8 million, attributed to the gradual recovery in the prices of crude oil and other products. petron, meanwhile, recorded a near sevenfold increase in net profit to rm112.62 million on growing sales volume and higher margins. gas malaysia, which distributes natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas to residences and industries, saw its net profit multiply five times to rm51.86 million on higher volume of gas sold, toll fees and assets contributed by customers.  plantations after being overlooked in the past couple of years, plantation players seem to be gaining momentum as commodity prices stage a comeback. genting plantations bhd, th plantations bhd, boustead plantations bhd, tsh resources bhd and hap seng consolidated bhd all ended 2016 on a high note. kuala lumpur kepong bhd and ioi corp bhd may have weighed the sectors earnings down but this was due to a high base effect and the foreign exchange factor. klks net profit more than halved to rm360.68 million from a year ago when a one-off gain of rm485.7 million from the disposal of plantation land was booked. excluding this, the groups pre-tax profit should be 11% higher. iois net profit fell 98% to rm15.6 million due to a forex translation loss of rm330 million on its foreign currency-denominated borrowings. other than the two, most of the plantation players posted better earnings except tdm bhd, which suffered a loss of rm21.6 million due to bigger losses at its indonesian operation, mainly from the impairment of assets.  consumer finance the jump in the earnings of consumer finance companies may not seem as significant as that of traditional banking groups but malaysia building society bhd, aeon credit service m bhd and rce capital bhd have been quietly making profits by giving out loans. mbsb, aeon credit and rce capital saw their financial performance improve by rm61.45 million, rm13.69 million and rm8.77 million respectively in 4q2016. financial service provider mbsb returned to the black with a quarterly net profit of rm45.64 million versus a net loss of rm15.81 million a year earlier on higher islamic financing income and lower bad loan allowance.  worst performers  telecommunications telecoms players reported a mixed bag of 4q report cards. the financial results of axiata group bhd, telekom malaysia bhd (tm) and digi.com bhd were weaker while those of time dotcom bhd and maxis bhd were stronger. however, the overall corporate earnings of the sector were severely hit by axiata, which reported a net loss of rm309.5 million in 4q2016 versus a net profit of rm467.24 million the year before due to a significant increase in forex loss, a lower contribution from 20%-owned idea cellular ltd in india and the weaker performance of celcom. similarly, tm saw its net profit fall nearly 20% to rm154.3 million, also primarily due to forex losses from group borrowings, arising from the ringgits depreciation against the us dollar. digis net profit dropped 2% to rm374.63 million in 4q2016 as revenue also fell on lower prepaid income and the group registering higher taxes. the poorer performance of these companies raises the question of whether they can still pay out decent dividends to shareholders.  healthcare and pharmaceuticals most healthcare and pharmaceutical companies ended the year on a low note, save for kpj healthcare bhd and ysp southeast asia holdings bhd. pharmaniaga bhd, apex healthcare bhd and ccm duopharma biotech bhd saw their earnings shrink by rm16.9 million, rm7 million and rm5.4 million respectively. but the bombshell came from ihh healthcare bhd, which slipped into the red with a net loss of rm42.5 million compared with a net profit of rm415.8 million in the previous year. the hospital operator made an exchange loss of rm244.59 million in 4q2016 against an exchange gain of rm121.27 million the year before. besides, it recognised higher doubtful debt expenses of rm49 million in 4q2016 compared with rm9.9 million the year before.  oil and gas services although global oil prices are headed higher, upstream players such as bumi armada bhd, umw oil & gas corp bhd (umwog), th heavy engineering bhd, malaysia marine and heavy engineering holdings bhd, alam maritim resources bhd and petra energy bhd have yet to shine. a whopping impairment charge of rm1.15 billion resulted in bumi armadas net loss widening to rm1.29 billion. umwog saw its net loss double to rm918.4 million, due mainly to an additional asset impairment loss of rm780.2 million. it has not gone unnoticed that these companies took advantage of the present environment and conducted kitchen sinking in 4q. theoretically, if oil prices continue to recover gradually, more jobs should come in and these o&g service providers should come out of the woods.  worst may be over if the latest numbers are any indication, overall corporate earnings showed signs of improvement in 4q2016, suggesting that the worst may be over and things should get better in 1q this year. after all, crude oil prices are holding up well and commodity prices are recovering steadily. according to areca capital sdn bhd ceo danny wong teck meng, three years ago, the downward trend in corporate earnings was caused by higher costs and a shrinking top line, which squeezed margins. but today, corporate earnings are recovering in tandem with oil prices. im optimistic about the outlook for corporate earnings because the cost structure has become leaner. so, margins will improve even if revenue remains stagnant. there is also the low base effect, he tells the edge. but he warns, it was bad in the past three years. we were in a bearish and cautious mood, so the turnaround in mood may not be felt immediately. wong also points out how more americans appear to be accepting president donald trumps policies as he seems to be able to get things done. assuming he (trump) really manages to fulfil some of his pledges, such as the us$1 trillion worth of infrastructure, it bodes well for global growth. in short, if he manages to drive the american economy, there should also be an improvement in consumer spending and confidence as well as overall corporate earnings. hong leong investment bank bhd dealer representative frank lin concurs. in the last few months, the important stock indices, especially the dow jones, have been hitting new highs and american investors seem to have taken a liking to their president. despite its debt problems, europe is very stable while china is recovering, he tells the edge. lin believes that there is light at the end of the tunnel for corporate earnings and that the stock market is reacting to it at the moment. construction will continue to do well while plantations will pick up because of higher commodity prices. the consumer sector should perform fairly well too. as stock markets gain momentum, given time, real estate prices usually follow suit, which in turn will see new excitement in property counters, he says. however, he warns that once the global economy picks up, central bankers, especially the us federal reserve, may tighten their monetary policies by raising interest rates. in fact, the fed is expected to raise rates as early as this month. the [current] depressed interest rate is actually helping the economy a lot. this will be one of the major concerns now as the stock market usually reacts negatively to rate hikes. a head of research, who declined to be named, is, however, not too optimistic about earnings growth. we think there is still more downside risk for earnings, especially in 1h2017. we think earnings will hit bottom and recover [only] later in the year and in 2018, she says.

whats wrong with cathay pacific airways ltd. the city of about 7.3 million people may no longer be capable of supporting a premium-service airline, especially when the 48 passenger-service operators based across the border in mainland china routinely launch price wars. cathay reported its first annual loss since 2008, skipped a second-half dividend and warned that the year ahead may not be any better as travelers continually hunt for cheaper fares. the troubles are yet another economic blow for a city grappling with fewer chinese tourists, declining retail sales and falling rankings in quality-of-life surveys. cathay and hong kong have been dwarfed, completely overwhelmed, by chinas growth, said shukor yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm endau analytics in malaysia. china doesnt need hong kong as a gateway. its position has become a lot less important than 10 years ago. cathays net loss totaled hk$575 million (us$74 million) in 2016, while sales dropped 9.4% to hk$92.8 billion, the airline said wednesday. passenger yields, the money earned from flying a traveler for one kilometer, dropped 9.2% to 54.1 hong kong cents last year. losses from fuel hedging totaled hk$8.46 billion last year, compared with hk$8.47 billion in 2015. cathay said it expects more hedging losses this year, though they should be lower. the companys american depository receipts fell 3.7%

them there. china plans to build more than 50 airports by 2020 to accommodate the crowds, raising the nations total of civil transport facilities to 260. the government wants to build six airport

number of chinese passenger and cargo airlines increased 28% to 55 in just five years. the number of planes in the air more than tripled in a decade to 2,650, according to the civil aviation industry statistics report. chinese carriers are giving better prices, said mohshin aziz, an analyst at maybank investment bank bhd in kuala lumpur. chinas no. 1 priority is to get as many international flights for the next five or so years. because of this, hong kong is becoming less attractive as a hub. thats shown by an economy that grew by just 1.9% last year, compared with chinas 6.7%. retail sales by value fell for 21 straight months, as fewer chinese tourists visited hong kong for shopping, eating and taking trips to macau. not helping matters is the perception that hong kong isnt holding up well in comparison to its asian neighbours, when it comes to quality of life. the city ranked 71st in the index released this month by consulting firm, mercer, a unit of marsh & mclennan

vulnerable against the dollar in the near term, said hirofumi suzuki, an economist for sumitomo mitsui banking corporation (smbc) in singapore. \"the theme now is an acceleration of the pace of (fed)

[as for former deputy prime minister] tan sri muhyiddin [yassin], some [settlers] are neutral and some are positive towards him. 1malaysia development bhd [1mdb] was a very small concern. the satisfaction of the [settlers] with the way they lead their life is quite high. the survey covered 80% of the ordinary rakyat, and not party members; so the survey is reasonable, involving 400 people per constituency, all over johor, shahrir says. but a second generation felda u00adsettler disagrees with shahrir. maybe the older u00adgeneration, our fathers and mothers are not bothered. but the second generation is different, the settler tells the edge. the settler, who is in his 40s, says that some of the concerns include the loss of value in fgv, the acquisition of menara felda for rm640.77 million from naza group when it has more than 20 acres in jalan semarak, and the recent corruption charges involving the sturgeon fish-rearing project. persatuan anak peneroka felda

although the older generation may not understand 1mdb or the eagle high acquisition, they can feel the effects of the rising cost of living. so, there should be a [cause for] concern, he says. considering that the 54 constituencies are dominated by felda settlers, their worries cannot be ignored. these constituencies make up 24% of the 222 parliamentary seats. in 2013, sabah and sarawak  generally considered bn strongholds  contributed 47 seats or 35% of bns haul of 133 seats, also a testament to the strength of felda settlers. but much of the support from the agency came at a cost  the settlers were consistently paid duit raya. in june last year, najib announced the payment of duit raya amounting to rm49.5 million, or about rm500, to all 99,046 felda settlers. initially, the duit raya was only rm300 per settler, but najib upped the amount by another rm200. in july 2015, before hari raya aidilfitri, 98,688 settlers received rm88.8 million in dividends and duit raya paid by fgv. dividends totalled rm59.21 million, or rm600 per settler, while the duit raya was rm29.61 million or rm300 per person. but now, with so many problems and u00adincessant bad news, morale is low. shahrir will have a tough time putting the agency on its feet. what is needed in felda is to get back the confidence of the staff, settlers and the market. felda is something the settlers feel proud about. they dont want to hear stories about [the agency] buying hotels in london, [its officials] living like lords, whole family members going to london for a holiday u2026 the top [people] seem to enjoy everything. theres the popular notion that they are the capitalists who are exploiting the settlers, the downtrodden, shahrir says. if the leakages stop, the settlers will settle down, he adds. with a three-year contract, shahrir is u00adlikely to have his hands full changing the settlers (mis)perceptions about felda.  feldas depleting cash pile part of the negative perception surrounding the plantation agency stems from its weak financials. while the 2015 financials are set to be tabled in parliament soon, 2014 was not a good year for the agency. judging from its annual reports, felda has suffered two consecutive years of net losses  until the financial year ended dec 31, 2014 (fy2014)  notably after the listing of fgv in june 2012. at group level, felda suffered a net loss of rm1.04 billion for fy2014. in the preceding year, the loss amounted to rm1.99 billion. these losses resulted in feldas accumulated funds dipping 16.5% to rm13.47 billion as at end-fy2014, from rm16.12 billion in fy2012. the major factors that dragged down feldas bottom line for fy2013 and fy2014 were its replanting programmes, socio-economic activities, and staffs salary and bonuses and allowances which amounted to rm3.17 billion and rm2.45 billion respectively. in 2014, the agency spent rm729.42 million on replanting programmes, while rm241.26 million was used for socio-economic activities and rm259.83 million for salary, bonuses and allowances. it is worrying that feldas combination of cash in hand and fixed deposits has dropped by more than half to rm434.46 million in fy2014, from rm936.08 million the year before. it is also noteworthy that part of the fixed deposits was placed in banks in order for felda to obtain borrowings. the groups long-term borrowings from external institutions were higher at rm6.07 billion as at fy2014, from rm5.15 billion previously, while short-term loans jumped threefold to rm1.70 billion in the same period, from rm574.05 million as at fy2013. on whether he was going to look into the less-than-impressive financials, shahrir says, despite what people say, cash is king, it is needed. instead of keeping it in assets  frozen  [you] might as well unfreeze it. allow it to move into the system. if i sell hotels, i get some more cash, then i can add it to the cash flow, i can add to the investment fund, and move from there. if we are able to sell down some of our assets, and rearrange and restructure our assets to cash, we should be all right. for this year, we should be all right for cash flow, we have loans but they are backed by our assets. [as for] our assets, we will decide whether to sell or use [them] as collateral u2026 for this year, we should be all right, shahrir says. felda recently sold 35 million shares, or part of its shareholding in malayan banking bhd (maybank), at between rm8 and rm8.05 apiece, raising rm280 million. according to maybanks 2015 annual report, the agency held 1.9%, or 185.15 million shares, in maybank, which has a market value of about rm1.5 billion. apart from selling shares in maybank, the government agency is also looking to hive off its hotels, including its grand plaza kensington hotel in london, which was acquired for rm330 million at end-2014. also under its umbrella is the grand plaza serviced apartments in bayswater, london, which it acquired for rm500 million in 2013. in total, felda has 12 hotels and resorts, including the felda residence hotels, seri costa melaka, grand borneo kota kinabalu, grand beach resort port dickson, and grand merdeka palace kuching besides the two in the uk. the sale of the hotels in london could bring in between rm500 million and rm1 billion.  streamlining investments at present, felda, via wholly-owned fic, has a 72.27% equity interest in developer encorp bhd, a direct 21.33% interest in iris, a direct 9.73% stake in barakah offshore petroleum bhd, and 20% equity in fgv. other ventures are largely hospitality-based. in mid-november 2013, after a slew of acquisitions, the plantation agency held 26.71% equity interest or 526.37 million shares in iris. however, in april 2015, it disposed of a chunk of shares, trimming its stake to 25.31% or 516.37 million shares. since then there has been sporadic selling, and the agency now has cut its stake to 21.33% or 479.36 million shares. at a press conference earlier this year, felda officials had even suggested disposing of iris, but shahrir seems to be against it. i think iris still has its own technology, its own internet protocol (ip), its own competent and competitive technology. im confident that, given time, well sort it out, well see what we can do, he says. under a restructuring plan, fic will handle non-plantation assets and strategic investments, while felda handles plantation assets. but shahrir says encorp could end up under felda, which indicates that things are still pretty fluid. so, fic would be for strategic investments, but the idea is to look for returns, he says. for its financial year ended december 2015, fic suffered an after tax loss of rm35.70 million from rm206.85 million in revenue. as at end-december 2015, fic had rm3.48 billion in non-current assets, and rm942.28 million in current assets. on the other side of the balance sheet, it had current liabilities of rm2.16 billion and non-current liabilities of rm1.62 billion. similarly, there were talks about privatising fgv, which would entail the agency forking out billions for the 2.92 billion shares it does not own. at its close of rm1.87 last thursday, plus a 20% premium, felda would have to fork out rm6.55 billion. at its ipo price of rm4.55, it would need to cough out rm13.29 billion. for its nine months ended september 2016, fgv suffered a net loss of rm98.2 million from rm12.09 billion in revenue. as at end-september last year, fgv had deposits, cash and bank balances of rm2.51 billion; short-term debt commitments of rm3.83 billion; and long-term borrowings totalling rm128.68 million. while shahrir does not divulge much on fgv, he says, it is a problem. i cant interfere with the management of fgv, so i hope [tan sri] isa [samad, fgvs chairman] spends more time looking at it. i dont know, i dont want to overstep my boundary, but we do have the biggest stake. so, maybe my board representatives may have to be changed, but im starting with fic. it is undeniable that investing feldas spare cash in real estate or other assets-yielding returns could be a wise move. that said, the top executives should also keep in mind that the spare cash could also be spent on improving efficiency and production yield. after all, the orginal aim of felda was to improve the livelihood of the settlers. cash handouts are certainly not a sustainable way to do that.

mohshin aziz, analyst at maybank kim eng, noted that sia cargos earnings jump merely masked over the underlying weakness in the airlines overall business where passenger yields had fallen in all of its business segments. yields were distinctively weak owing to intense competition and overcapacity, [and] costs were in order thanks to lower fuel hedging losses and productivity gains, says aziz, adding that sias nine-month core earnings of s$457 million achieved just 69% of its full year estimates. maybank kim eng has a price target of s$9.70 for sia. dbs group researchs analyst paul yong agreed, and is forecasting sluggish growth in operating profits over the coming quarters amid the weak demand environment and higher non-fuel related expenses. while sia has enjoyed lower fuel costs in the last few quarters, lower revenue as a result of lower yields (for both the core sia passenger and cargo segments) and higher non-fuel costs such as maintenance, repair and overhaul (mro) and staff costs have eaten into these savings, explains yong in a note on wednesday. dbs has a price target of s$10.10 for the stock. in fact, cimbs yap believes the low-cost carrier business is not without its own set of troubles. scoot has delivered stronger y-o-y earnings for at least the past two years, as the delivery of its b787s led to aggressive cost-efficient expansion, coinciding with low oil prices and the decommissioning of aged 777-200s, he says in his note on wednesday. however, for the first time ever, scoots 3q revenue per available seat km (rask) fell by more than its cost per available seat km (cask), burdened as it were by 50% y-o-y available seat km (ask) expansion over the past four quarters, by promotional fares necessitated by its recent entry into india and by the negative impact of demonetisation in india. yap concedes sia has continued to invest in its longer term business, by refurbishing its lounges, installing premium economy seats on all of its 777-300er planes, and launching a new premium product for five of its a380s that will be delivered over the next two years. the group is also expected to relaunch direct flights to the us and complete the brand merger between scoot and tigerair within the year. however, yap continues to be pessimistic about the airlines fortunes. these far-sighted initiatives keep sia competitive against its peers, but the road ahead is tough. only a major global recovery can lift earnings from current depressed levels. cimb has a price target of s$10.50 for sia. furthermore, uob kay hians k ajith noted that the group has entered into a longer-dated brent hedge, hedging 33% to 39% of its fuel requirements at between us$53 to us$59 per barrel until 2022. these are attractive levels but will likely result in substantial forward commitments, which could affect dividend payout, says ajith who has a target of s$10.10. the key lies in the growing competition in the long haul market and the budget consciousness of its customers, according to maybanks aziz. sias misfortunes are due to market overcrowding on its key markets. this is structural in nature and despite managements best efforts; they dont seem to have an answer for it. it is very likely that the current mid single-digit net profit margins and return on equity is what sia could hope for in the future. that said, its best to avoid

of y-o-y decline. maybank says this means the worst is over and that the better-than-expected yield recovery will lift maybanks 2016 earnings estimate. 4q16 fresh fruit bunch yield rose 3.9% y-o-y to 5.3 tonne/ha, signalling that the lagged impact from the 2015 el nino may have ended, as sufficient rainfall returned to bumitama agris estates throughout 2016. in terms of output, ffb nucleus output

sales totalling 195,000mt to be delivered to wilmar between june and dec 2016. prices agreed ranged between idr7,182-7,364/kg (s$220-s$225). but as indonesias spot price has averaged idr9,000/kg in 4q16, bumitama agri will not fully benefit from the spike in spot prices. nonetheless, this was already made known to the market back in 2q16 and has been priced into the stock. by ongs estimates, bumitama agri will likely report 4q16 core patmi of idr300 billion (s$3.2 million), bringing its full-year core patmi to idr790 billion; 16% above maybanks existing estimates. we maintain our

non-f&b and household goods for retailers). as for f&b, based on our understanding that companies are still allowed to increase prices to maintain margins, we believe that it is short-term neutral.

however, pc&apr 2016 covers a narrow scope of products (versus all goods and services previously). in addition to the differences in margin percentage as a mechanism to determine unreasonably high profits, the differences in markup percentage of goods in the new regulation is also another mechanism. recall that pc&apr 2014 had been in exercise since jan 2, 2015 to curb profiteering post-goods and services tax implementation. the profit is determined as unreasonably high if the margin percentage or markup percentage of goods on any date in a particular financial year or calendar year exceeds the margin percentage or markup percentage of goods on the first day of that particular financial year or calendar year. while the new regulation may seem to restrict affected f&b and household goods companies flexibility in adjusting product prices, we understand they are allowed to increase prices to maintain margins (that is to pass on higher operating expenditure or costs of goods). but, due to current weak consumer sentiment, we believe most (including those in non-f&b, non-household goods) may only make minimal price adjustments. negatively, the new regulation seems to forfeit margin expansion in f&b and household goods purely through price increases, in our view. our current assumptions for most in our coverage are for net profit margins to stay flat in 2017. downside risks include further slowdown in consumption demand, a continuous rise in raw material prices with sustained ringgit weakness and the inability to pass on the higher costs due to the weak sentiment.  maybank ib research, jan 16"}, "116": {"date_posted": "17/1/2017", "title": "klci to continue moving sideways, support seen at 1,640", "article": " kuala lumpur (jan 17): the fbm klci is

unrealized mark-to-market losses from weaker capital markets, this can result in lower profits for ocbc, cautions ng. earnings momentum may not sustain in weaker economic conditions. whats more, the

keong and neel sinha noted that the market was treating the conglomerate as a proxy to an oil price increase, despite offshore and marine only representing 26% of the groups overall earnings. in our view, this is a set up for disappointment in 2017 as we envisage several de-rating catalysts from earnings per share downgrades, provisions and dividend miss, said the pair. they explained that the rig overcapacity has led to just 50% of active rigs being utilised and another 15% of newbuilds remaining in yards. on the relatively low forecasted oil prices of us$50 to us$55 per barrel, offshore drilling activities would likely pick up, albeit at a slower pace. that means it could take several years for excess capacity to be absorbed. there is also the issue of competition from korean and chinese yards to contend with. weak order replenishments and deferment could already reduce keppels fy16e o&m revenue by more than half from the s$6.2 billion to s$8.6 billion in fy13 to fy15, cautions yeak and sinha. if the order drought persists and o&m revenue drops to s$1.6 billion to s$1.8 billion levels, the segment may sink into operating losses. and thats not all. the pair also added that keppel may need to make more asset provisions in the upcoming fy16 results, given that asset values are not likely to have improved as rig utilisation remains weak. at the same time, the groups dividend yield is likely to fall from its historical 5% and 6% to as low as 3%, on the back of the weaker performance from its cash generating offshore and marine segment. as such, maybank kim

picks for 2017", "article": "  as the year draws to a close, many can now heave a sigh of relief  the equity market has proved to be a challenging beast to tame even for the most seasoned investor. however, the relief will be short-lived as uncertainty remains the buzzword in the coming year. fund managers and analysts are already expecting several world events next year that will cause more uncertainty. indisputably, incoming us president donald trumps foreign and trade policies will be closely monitored by the investing community, which is waiting to see if he will fulfil his policy pledges to make america great again. apart from that, there are also the elections that will be held in several european countries next year. some fear that the voice of the anti-eu may prevail as member countries continue to suffer years of high unemployment and tepid growth. maybank investment bank research highlights the risk of more aggressive us federal reserve rate hikes as a result of higher inflation and growth expectations from fiscal expansion plans in the us. this will, in turn, widen the monetary divergence between the us and the other major economies, especially with the european central bank having extended its quantitative easing to end-2017, it says in a recent report. on the home front, some have singled out the 14th general election as a factor that could add uncertainty to the local stock market. however, those who believe in an election rally are expecting the polls to get the bulls charging in. to recap, prime minister datuk seri najib razak hinted at the recent umno general assembly that the 14th general election could come anytime soon. despite the events that could cause market jitters next year, fund managers believe that there are still bright spots. plantation is one sector that is starting to look interesting again. this is due to the unexpected rebound in crude palm oil (cpo) prices this year. year to date, they have risen 36.14% to rm3,123 per tonne, the highest since july 2012. at the peak in 2010, it was rm3,619 per tonne. according to inter-pacific securities head of research pong teng siew, this is a good time for cpo as prices tend to move up between november and march because of low output. maybank ib research says in a note that it expects cpo prices to start the year on a high but foresees a correction in the second quarter before hitting the bottom in the third when production reaches its peak. the research house says the average selling price forecast for 2017 is rm2,400 per tonne. plantation is a long-term play. look out for planters with young trees because that is where you will see growth in output, says phillip capital management chief investment officer ang kok heng. construction is another sector worth watching. with massive infrastructure development taking place, such as the mass rapid transit project and pan-borneo highway, and more projects to be implemented over the next two years, construction players are bound to benefit from them. significant projects slated for the next two years include the east coast rail line, kuala lumpur-singapore high-speed rail, light rail transit line 3, gemas-johor baru double tracking and the remaining work for mass rapid transit lines 2 and 3. there is also the rm30 billion melaka gateway trading port, a joint venture by state-funded kaj development sdn bhd and china-based conglomerate powerchina international group ltd. we like pure construction players. there are a lot of contracts not rolled out yet. furthermore, the weakness in the ringgit will not affect many of these players as they can source their raw materials locally, says ang. etiqa insurance and takaful head of research chris eng prefers smaller construction players but cautions that some companies profit margins may be thin despite securing jobs. meanwhile, the agreement between the oil producing nations and the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec) to cut production is expected to rebalance demand and supply of crude oil and provide some reprieve to oil prices. maybank ib research, which has upgraded the sector to positive, believes that it is a good time to bottom fish as the sector has seen the bottom, with most stocks having lost much of their value. the sector is due for a cyclical recovery, on improving sentiment and operating outlook. we see further rerating prospects should saudi aramcos investment of a 50% stake in petronas rapid (refinery and petrochemical integrated development) project materialise, it says. crude oil aside, the weaker ringgit has also continued to provide opportunity for export-oriented counters. ang opines that the soft currency has made malaysian exports more competitive. this bodes well for the export-oriented companies as well as those catering for both the local and foreign markets. yes, export-oriented counters have benefited from [favourable] foreign exchange, but that is only a short-term gain. i believe that there is demand for malaysian goods and they have become more competitive with the weaker ringgit. companies with own-brand products should find themselves on a better footing, he says. etiqas eng says investors should try to buy now and sell by april or may next year, given that most of the closely followed global events will take place in the middle of the year. yes, there are definitely more uncertainties next year compared with 2016.  tenaga nasional despite posting a commendable 10% y-o-y gain in core net profit to rm7.7 billion in its financial year ended aug 31, 2016 (fy2016), tnbs share price has been on a downward trend. at its close of rm13.74 last thursday, the stock had lost 6.52% from its all-time high of rm14.67, recorded in the middle of the year. however, it was still 6.31% higher y-o-y. at this level, tnb is valued only at 10.53 times earnings. a report by ta securities points out that this is one standard deviation away from the groups historical (since 2000) average of 17.1 times. the weakness in tnbs share price is indicative of selling by foreign funds, given the recent depreciation of the ringgit. however, it is important to note that there appears to be plenty of demand for tnbs shares. recall that khazanah nasional bhd placed out a 1.5% block of tnb shares at rm14.30 apiece earlier this year. moving forward, tnb is one of the few blue chips that near-guarantee stable earnings despite the increasingly volatile economic landscape. after all, under the new imbalance cost pass-through mechanism, all variations in fuel costs are passed on to consumers. hence, neither a recovery in coal prices nor further depreciation of the ringgit should have a sizeable impact on tnbs earnings. this resilience makes tnb one of the few defensive stocks that funds can rely on and it is definitely worth more than 10.53 times earnings. nonetheless, the recent trend of awarding power projects to industry newcomers may cap some of the earnings growth over the next few years.  by ben shane lim   gadang holdings the construction and property developer has lost some of its lustre by becoming selective about its new jobs. its net profit fell 20% y-o-y to rm16.7 million in the first quarter ended aug 31. but of more concern is the 60% y-o-y drop in construction revenue during the quarter as its jobs wound up. it does not help that gadangs tender book, which stood at rm10 billion at the start of the year, has fallen to rm5.2 billion. but that is not necessarily a bad thing. its management has always taken a conservative approach to bidding for work, preferring to avoid projects with low margins that cannot justify the risks. gadang does not need to bag many projects, just the best ones. with mrt2 now in full swing, gadang is expected to secure a package, given its performance in constructing viaducts for the first line. a single package would boost the groups order book by rm1 billion. meanwhile, there is the 37km-long lrt3 that gadang is also bidding for. at last thursdays close of rm1.01, the company is valued at 6.51 times earnings, making it one of the cheapest construction stocks on the market. the average earnings multiple in the sector is 14 times. beyond construction, gadang has a sizeable property development arm. this year, the group became development partner for the 24.08-acre kwasa damansara township that has an estimated gross development value (gdv) of rm700 million. this is expected to start contributing to earnings in 2018.  by ben shane lim  kerjaya prospek group a relatively new name on investors radar screens, the company is the product of a backdoor listing by datuk tee eng ho. the bulk of its construction business worth rm438 million was injected into it at the beginning of the year. it also came with an order book of rm2.7 billion and a profit guarantee of rm150 million over three years up to fy2018 ending dec 31. based on its closing price of rm2.08 last thursday, kerjaya prospek had a market capitalisation of rm1 billion, valuing it at 11.55 times earnings. the companys adjusted earnings per share for the year is estimated at 18 sen. kerjaya prospek is not a mere asset injection. this year, it managed to replenish its order book with rm1.5 billion worth of jobs, boosting the outstanding amount to rm2.89 billion and improving its earnings visibility. the company should be able to continue to fill its order book, thanks to the projects of its existing clientele, such as s p setia bhds setia sky seputeh (gdv: rm950 million) and eastern & oriental bhds puro place (gdv: rm800 million), notes kenanga research in a report. kerjaya prospek is also attractive for its cash-rich balance sheet, which is uncommon among its peers. the company still has a cash balance of rm109 million after paying a four sen per share dividend this year, which works out to cash per share of 21.4 sen.  by ben shane lim   sarawak oil palms sops forward price-earnings ratio (per) of 15.42 times is undemanding, especially compared to the average 2017 forecast per of 19 times of its mid-cap peers. the planters proposal to fully acquire shin yang oil palm sdn bhd for rm873 million in july would add 47,000ha of plantation land to its land bank, of which 23,798ha are planted with oil palm and 6,772ha are unplanted. the average tree age in shin yang oil palms plantations is seven years, which would reduce the average age of sops trees to 10.1 years post-acquisition from 11.1 years at present. it is worth noting that shin yang oil palm is being acquired from sops major shareholder, shin yang holding sdn bhd. we believe the young age profile of the acquisition and maturing area of about 2,200ha between 2017 and 2019 should contribute to above-average fresh fruit bunch growth from fy2017e onwards, says kenanga research in an october report. to fund the acquisition, the planter issued 128 million renounceable rights shares on the basis of two for every seven sop shares held. the rights issue was priced at rm2.80 apiece, below sops market price. despite a rebound in crude palm oil prices, sop lagged behind its peers. at its close of rm3.71 last wednesday, the stock had declined 8.65% year to date.  by esther lee   tsh resources the mid-cap planter was among those that suffered from the effects of el niu00f1o this year. nevertheless, analysts are expecting production to improve going forward. for the cumulative nine months ended sept 30, tsh resources recorded a net profit of rm81.6 million after stripping out foreign exchange gains and other exceptional items. about 80% of its revenue and profit is derived from its plantation business while the remaining 20% comes from its wood-product manufacturing and bio-integration divisions. it is worth noting that tsh resources crude palm oil extraction rate is 21%, above the industry average of 20.46%. its fresh fruit bunch yield is high at 24.7% per hectare compared with the industry average of 18.48% while its average tree age is young at eight years. the planter has 67,853ha of unplanted land, which should sustain its growth over the next 10 to 14 years, says bimb securities research. tsh resources has proposed to privatise its listed but loss-making subsidiary, ekowood international bhd, in which it holds a 67.46% stake. analysts believe the privatisation will have negligible impact on the planters shareholders. at its closing price of rm1.87 last thursday, the stock had lost 2.55% year to date.  by esther lee   mkh based on a 2017 price-earnings ratio forecast of 6.65 times, the plantation and property player is a steal for investors, especially since it is expecting the earnings of its plantation division to double next year on the back of stronger crude palm oil prices and better yields. the trees in mkhs 15,400ha plantation in kalimantan, indonesia, are expected to reach the peak of maturity next year. according to alliancedbs research, the estate is expected to achieve a yield of 29 tonnes per hectare, which the research house deems impressive, given the average tree age of seven years. the company plans to purchase 2,000ha of plantation land near its existing estate in indonesia for rm15 million. this would increase its plantation area to about 18,000ha. as of now, the companys largest contributing segment is still its property division, which accounts for 70% of its revenue. mkh has not been spared the effects of a soft property market. however, its focus on providing affordable homes resulted in unbilled sales of rm827.5 million as at sept 30, which should keep the group going for 1u00bd years. the company has a sizeable land bank in the kajang/semenyih corridor, which will see it benefit from the completion of the mrt lines next year. mkh recently proposed a cash call followed by a bonus issue. closing at rm2.86 last thursday, the stock had gained 34.47% year to date. by esther lee   samchem holdings in contrast to the general trend of disappointing corporate results, samchems earnings are back on the growth path. it posted a net profit of rm11.48 million for the nine months ended sept 30, 2016, up 48% from the previous corresponding period, while revenue grew 8.3% to rm483.7 million. its management is confident of sustainable earnings growth, thanks to rising demand for petrochemicals in asean, especially vietnam and indonesia, where manufacturing plants are sprouting up. sales volume is growing 30% to 40%. the [growth] pattern is likely to continue, if not become stronger, its ceo, datuk ng lian poh, told the edge in an interview. according to him, selling prices have also stabilised. the homegrown speciality petrochemicals distributor has a foothold in malaysia, indonesia and vietnam. with a market capitalisation of rm130 million, it evolved into a leading player in asean after the consolidation of the regional industry in recent years. ng believes there are exciting prospects for the petrochemicals industry in vietnam and indonesia. however, samchem is not just targeting these two countries but the whole of asean with its 450 million population. demand for petrochemicals usually grows in tandem with increasing affluence. given its current scale, samchem forms part of the supply chain of many mncs that have manufacturing facilities in the region. furthermore, the high barriers to entry are advantageous to the company. samchems earnings per share for 9mfy2016 was 8.44 sen. based on an annualised eps of 11.25 sen, the stock is trading at 11.28 times.  by kathy fong   hong leong industries at its closing price of rm9.38 last thursday, the companys share price had gained 65.8% year to date. however, it was trading at a low 2017 price-earnings ratio forecast of 10.95 times. hl industries has two core businesses  the manufacturing and selling of fibre cement and concrete roofing products under its hume brand and the more exciting business of manufacturing and trading yamaha motorcycles in malaysia and vietnam through its 24% associate stake in yamaha motor vietnam co ltd. thanks to vietnams fast-growing economy, many feel hl industries is facing exciting days ahead. after all, the country has a young population of over 90 million, the vast majority of whom use motorcycles as their primary mode of transport. in its first quarter ended sept 30, the company registered year-on-year revenue growth of 9%, attributable to strong sales of motorcycles and ceramic tiles. net profit surged 44.5% to rm64.77 million on higher contribution from motorcycle sales. hl industries vietnam associate contributed rm30.7 million to earnings. in fact, hl industries net profit in fy2016 jumped 42.7% year on year to rm247.22 million due to a higher contribution from its vietnam associate. kenanga research says in a report that the companys yamaha motorcycles are enjoying increasing demand in vietnam as a result of effective marketing strategies. currently, yahama motorcycles command a quarter of the vietnamese market while honda dominates 70% of it.  by esther lee   kawan food well known for its frozen paratha, the company saw its earnings climb in its latest two quarters after a dip in the first quarter. for the cumulative nine months ended sept 30, its revenue increased to rm144.3 million, up 15.6% from a year ago, as it saw higher sales across all regions, save for europe, while net profit registered a 2.8% growth to rm25.79 million. more than 60% of kawan foods sales is derived from its export markets. the company has a strong following in the us, which accounted for 34% of its sales in the last nine months of its financial year. cimb research says in a report that steady sales in the domestic market also suggest that the frozen food manufacturers local business has recovered from the impact of the goods and services tax. as at sept 30, kawan food had a cash pile of rm67.58 million, and it declared a special dividend of 3.5 sen per share in november. this was on top of a 2.5 sen per share interim dividend that was announced in its third quarter results. at a 2017 price-earnings ratio forecast of 29.92 times, many would consider kawan foods valuation lofty. however, the potential of better sales in its export markets, given that malaysian exports have become more competitive with the weakening ringgit, could be a reason to give kawan food a second look.  by esther lee   e.a. technique (m) it may not be hard to fathom why this oil and gas stock had tumbled nearly 47% year to date as at last thursday. the prolonged industry downturn saw it slip from its peak of rm1.46 in august last year to a record low of 45 sen at end-november. it bounced back to 59 sen last thursday but was still trading below its 2014 initial public offering price of 65 sen. some fund managers opine that the counter has been oversold, given its high earnings visibility compared with its peers in the oil and gas industry. but its management must be puzzled at the selling pressure on the stock, although the company receives steady recurring income from its long-term charters. e.a. technique managing director datuk abdul hak md amin told the edge that it was business as usual at the company despite the oil rout. we are less affected by the downturn in the oil and gas industry because our clients are mainly in the mid and downstream segments, such as petrochemical companies and refineries, he said, adding that the utilisation of the companys fleet of vessels was more than 90%. furthermore, its vessels are chartered for transporting products, like gasoline and methanol, in the region. thus, the risk of contract termination is low because the demand for such materials remains steady. for the nine months ended sept 30, the company posted a higher net profit of rm30.49 million, or 6.05 sen per share, against rm26.19 million, or 5.2 sen per share, a year ago. in the meantime, the new vessels coming on stream with charters are expected to boost its earnings.  by kathy fong   eg industries the kedah-based company is a growth stock despite the current harsh economic climate. a new substantial shareholder brought change to the company, enabling it to climb the value chain by providing box-building and reap the benefits. box-building refers to end-to-end manufacturing services that start at designing and end at the shipping of the completed products to end users. eg industries has graduated from being just an original equipment manufacturer. it now serves world-renowned electrical and electronic brand names in several industries, including consumer electronics, ict, medical, automotive and telecommunications. in fy2016 ended june 30, eg industries posted a pre-tax profit of rm19.7 million, down from rm23.63 million the year before. however, it had booked a disposal gain of rm15.38 million in fy2015. excluding the extraordinary gain, the groups pre-tax profit would have been rm8.24 million that year. the companys growth momentum continued in its 1qfy2017, with pre-tax profit rising 41.6% year on year to rm7.14 million. we like eg industries for its gradual transition into a vertically integrated ems (electronic manufacturing service) player through its continuous expansion into the higher margin, full-assembly services segment, and its projected three-year core earnings cagr of 40%, says uob-kay hian. the research house sees the companys net profit ballooning to rm30.6 million, or 11.4 sen per share, in fy2017 and rm36.7 million, or 13.6 sen per share, in fy2018. eg industries share price was hovering in a tight range of 80 sen to 90 sen for most of the year.  by kathy fong   kimlun corp the johor-based company has been a beneficiary of the property boom in the state. while having been involved in a large number of residential projects, kimlun has also taken on infrastructure jobs in johor. however, it has risen to prominence for manufacturing segmental box girders for the mrt project under its manufacturing division. at its near-record-high closing price of rm2.14 last thursday, kimluns share price had surged 56% year to date. however, its valuation, at 8.23 times earnings, is still not stretched. in the nine months ended sept 30, the companys net profit rose 17% year on year to rm57.7 million. interestingly, revenue fell 14%, primarily due to lower contributions from the construction segment. the fall was compensated for by higher margins. kimlun bagged rm1.1 billion of new construction jobs this year (compared with rm700 million in fy2015), boosting the groups order book to rm1.93 billion. its manufacturing segment, meanwhile, saw its orders double to rm300 million, driven by a rm200 million contract to supply segmental box girders for mrt2, which was awarded in march. moving forward, the group is expected to bag the contract to supply tunnel lining segments for mrt2 as well. kimlun also supplies pre-cast concrete products to singapore. it is diversifying its offerings, now also supplying singapore with rail sleepers and parapet walls. as a result, the company has benefited from the weaker ringgit. kimlun has paid dividends consistently and is expected to declare a dividend of 6.8 sen this year, for a yield of 3.27%. at the same time, the group has a relatively healthy net gearing of 9.9%.  by ben shane lim "}, "123": {"date_posted": "4/1/2017", "title": "klci rises 0.48% as finance sector lifts", "article": " kuala lumpur (jan 4): the fbm klci

elsewhere. theres a danger that their eyes may not be on the ball, giving [legal nfos] a tough environment to operate in, the source said in a phone interview, projecting 2017 to be equally tough for the sector. tax-wise, though yin opined any more hikes would be counterproductive as they would only allow illegal nfos to offer better payouts, thus gaining them even more market share. cheah thinks a post-budget tax may still be tabled in the coming months and advised investors to remain cautious. already, genting malaysia bhd is facing a regional casino tax of about 25% of gaming revenues, which is probably the second highest in asia after macau, yin said. this means raising the tax rate will only send gamblers elsewhere in southeast asia, yin added. as for genting singapore plc, yin said the tightening of regulations in the city state after the 1malaysia development bhd scandal has made it more difficult to open a private banking account in singapore, which is the mainstay of most vip gamblers. even china is imposing a new slew of capital controls, so gaming volumes from [chinese vips] will probably see some downward pressure, he said. analysts, however, agreed that the weakening ringgit is seen as a draw for foreign tourists and locals alike, and weak consumer sentiment may be bottoming out. an industry insider, however, pointed out that disposable income continues to be threatened by inflationary pressures. in the case of genting malaysia, yin said the higher volume of visitors to genting highlands, which had increased some 7% year-on-year (y-o-y) in the third quarter, would offset the lower average spend per visitor. however, absolute values of chinese tourists are not expected to increase significantly  at least not in his estimation. mainland chinese form about 4% to 5% of gentings total visitor base. according to alliancedbs, genting malaysia remains their top pick. the research house placed a buy call on the stock with catalysts such as additional gaming capacity from the genting integrated tourism plan (gitp). according to a nov 25 report by kenanga research, genting malaysias overall results remained resilient with the early phase of gitp to drive top-line growth. as for nfos, magnums net profit rose 44.9% to rm55.02 million in the third quarter ended sept 30, 2016, from rm37.97 million in the previous corresponding quarter due to lower payout prizes, although revenue fell 2% to rm647.19 million from rm660.17 million in the same quarter on lower gaming sales. magnums share price has been sliding since mid-2013, when it was

created a sustained demand for infrastructure assets. this, in turn, has produced an attractive asset class for investors looking for yield and a stable income stream. while governments continue to allocate funds to this segment, the private sector has stepped up to provide solutions to social needs. companies involved in billion-dollar infrastructure assets such as utilities and roads have seen profitable returns of 8% to at least 15%. with the demand for such assets expected to continue growing, there is huge potential to be tapped in the asean infrastructure market over the next decade, says maybank asset management group ceo nor azamin salleh. since the investment needed is massive, asean governments are working with the private sector to raise capital. this has created a situation of capital recycling, where owners of infrastructure assets may release the capital tied up in their assets to fund new infrastructure projects. the need for capital recycling provides the opportunity for a regional infrastructure fund that will allow them to buy into brownfield, operational infrastructure assets with existing cash flows. hence, this will generate a great appeal for investments in greenfield infrastructure projects. infrastructure assets will continue to benefit from the weak global economic landscape and slow global trade, says chow kar tzen, senior portfolio manager at affin hwang asset management bhd. he believes that public investment  a component of the gross domestic product (gdp)  will make up for the weak net exports, personal consumption and private investments (the other three components that make up the gdp). this is evident, especially in asean, where governments continue to ramp up fiscal spending to support growth. we expect the indonesian market to provide some interesting opportunities given the recent passing of the tax amnesty bill, which will see more funds channelled to infrastructure expenditure, he says. chow notes that while there has been some volatility, there are pockets of opportunities in the philippine market with the aggressive infrastructure spending targets set by president rodrigo dutertes administration. meanwhile, the smooth royal succession has improved market sentiment in thailand. with this, we believe the infrastructure projects that were identified earlier will take off, he says. according to the aseans half a trillion dollar infrastructure opportunity report published by goldman sachs in 2013, an estimated us$228 billion is needed annually until 2022 to meet all the infrastructure needs in the region. the energy and transport sectors are expected to make up 65% of the investments. pension funds are also tapping into infrastructure assets. the employees provident fund (epf) is among those looking into this segment. ceo datuk shahril ridza ridzuan says when it comes to such investments, the retirement fund usually seeks brownfield assets that are fully operational and have cash flow visibility  the long-term nature of these investments has the potential to provide us with a real rate of return, which is in line with our investment targets. the epf as a retirement savings fund has always focused on delivering sustainable long-term returns by targeting a 2% real dividend over a three-year rolling period, he says. the epf is looking to invest in core infrastructure assets, such as toll roads, airports, seaports, waste management facilities and power plants. its main criteria when considering an investment is the operational track record, growth prospects and regulatory framework that governs the asset. in september, the epf bought a 40% stake in the concessionaire for the duta-ulu kelang expressway (duke)  konsortium lebuhraya utara-timur (kl) sdn bhd  for rm1.13 billion cash. and in november last year, through its wholly-owned company pinggiran ventures sdn bhd, it bought a 50% stake in pinggiran muhibbah sdn bhd, a subsidiary of highway and waste company taliworks corp bhd. pinggiran muhibbah owns the operator of the new north klang straits bypass. kumpulan wang persaraan diperbadankan (kwap), meanwhile, has indirect exposure to various geographical regions and infrastructure sub-sectors through its private infrastructure funds. ceo datuk wan kamaruzaman wan ahmad says these investments include conventional and renewable energy, water and transport. we are constantly evaluating opportunities to invest directly in domestic and foreign infrastructure assets and projects. areas of interest include energy and transport assets as these sectors require the most capital and, hence, are more open to institutional investors such as kwap. there is also the lure of upside potential and stable returns, he says. nor azamin says maybank asset management favours the energy sector for several reasons. the high capital requirements create capital recycling opportunities. according to the energy outlook for asia and the pacific report published by the international energy agency in october 2013, the region requires massive amounts of investments in energy infrastructure, with total projected market demand for power in eight asean countries projected to reach 1,958 terawatt-hour (twh) by 2035. investing in the energy sector will allow investors to enjoy long-term cash flow predictability, he points out. the regulated nature of the energy sector, coupled with the long-term power purchase agreements, means that the assets future cash flow will be highly predictable. the energy sector also has relatively lower risk than the other infrastructure sub-sectors as it is exposed to mostly sovereign credits. in addition, some asean countries, such as myanmar and indonesia, have started to price their power purchase offtake agreements in the us dollar, which reduces foreign exchange risk when investing, says nor azamin, referring to several studies. moreover, investment in the energy sector is inflation-proof, he adds, as most of the power purchase agreements allow for an upward revision of offtake prices by taking into account the inflation rate. chow says affin hwang asset management has a diversified strategy when it comes to investing in infrastructure. we have holdings in and continue to monitor a relatively diverse infrastructure-related universe, which includes toll roads, airports, energy providers (including renewables), cement suppliers, telecommunications companies and environment-related companies. he says its decision to participate depends on the markets and underlying fundamentals of the companies. for example, the company maintains an optimistic outlook on telecommunications service providers in indonesia given the high-data traffic growth and competition becoming less intense. similarly, the oligopolistic advantage that energy providers, toll road owners, cement suppliers and airport concessionaires have make some of these companies an attractive investment, says chow. the companies that we have participated in also have a strong balance sheet, which we look out for as it provides the companies with a stronger ability to generate steady cash flow for dividends. in an oct 19 report titled infrastructure for growth: the dawn of a new multi-trillion dollar asset class, published by citi gps: global perspectives and solutions, there is a huge opportunity to invest in this sector globally. it estimates that over the next 15 years, worldwide infrastructure spending to facilitate stronger global economic growth will amount to us$58.6 trillion. despite the need for infrastructure, public investment in this sector has been falling in both developed and emerging markets (see graphic). according to a citi research report, infrastructure could be a much-needed boost to global growth as a 1% increase in infrastructure investment correlates with a 1.2% increase in gdp growth.  healthy rate of return what kind of returns can one expect from infrastructure assets? they depend on the sectors and markets the assets are in, says chow. against the current economic backdrop, we have tilted out portfolio exposure to income-yielding investments. we currently hold a core position in companies that are able to provide both attractive dividends and growth opportunities. we are currently looking at 8% to 12% in total returns from these investments. shahril says the assets that the epf invests in typically have an internal rate of return of 10% to 13%. the returns depend on such factors as the risk profile of the assets, length of the concessions and stability of cash flow. we have gradually incorporated environmental, social and governance (esg) criteria in our investment parameters, in compliance with the evolving business and investment environment. this effort includes assessing whether the assets are shariah-compliant, he adds. kwaps wan kamaruzaman says the long-term returns from infrastructure investment could be in the high single digits of 8% or 9% for regulated assets in developed markets to more than 15% for a greenfield asset in a developing market. he adds that the esg criteria is an important component of infrastructure investment and they need to be carefully assessed early in the due diligence phase. thorough due diligence and understanding of the regulations, government and demand drivers are crucial when investing in infrastructure. kwap will also leverage its relationship with experienced and skilled infrastructure fund managers to navigate the inherent risks of these investments, he says. shahril says one of the main risks in infrastructure investment is the regulatory framework of the country the assets are in. thus, a strong and stable regulatory framework is the basis for the epfs investment decisions. we are generally uncomfortable with construction risk, which is why we prefer brownfield assets with a track record and proven cash flow. in cases where we take on some construction risk, we will take steps to obtain the necessary guarantees of performance or hedge those risks, he says. maybank asset managements nor azamin says infrastructure investment comes with political and economic risks. there is a possibility that the infrastructure asset could be nationalised following an abrupt regime change in a particular country. there is also the possibility of termination of long-term power purchase agreements. however, this is highly unlikely to happen because of the current energy shortage in asean, he adds. we manage our risks by looking for assets that have operational track records, existing cash flows and long-term contracts with sovereign-backed entities, as well as inflation rate-benchmarked periodic revisions of tariffs, political stability and the strength of local laws and regulations, says nor azamin. infrastructure funds are most suitable for institutional investors with long-term horizons as there is a need for the capital to be sticky, he says. that is because the fund will not exit any of its investments until the end of the tenure. affin hwang asset managements chow advises investors to understand the assets thoroughly. potential risks could include budgetary concerns, such as higher than anticipated costs. operational experience, or a lack thereof, could result in a company being unable to make good on promised deliverables. with the higher costs that are generally tagged to infrastructure projects, an interest rate hike will also pose as a risk, given its potential impact on the companys borrowing cost, he says. thus, we advocate the importance of understanding the company before making an investment. we continue to focus on fundamentally strong companies and select investments based on a bottom-up stock selection process to mitigate such risks.  time for infrastructure push for countries with clear infrastructure needs, efficient public investment processes, spare capacity and accommodative monetary policy, the coming year should give them a fiscal boost, says lucy ocarroll, chief economist at aberdeen solutions. as concerns about the side effects of an ever looser monetary policy have grown, so have the demands for greater fiscal activism. much has been made of the moves by a small number of countries, including japan and china, to ease fiscal policy. [there have been] statements of intent by others, including the uk and the us, to do more. whether they amount to much remains to be seen, she says in an oct 13 report, titled infrastructure spending: whats not to like?, published by aberdeen asset management. according to ocarroll, history suggests that the gains from infrastructure spending can be impressive. taking a sample of 17 advanced economies, an increase in infrastructure spending equivalent to 1% of the gross national income boosted the level of output by 1.5% four years later. so for every pound sterling or dollar a government spends on infrastructure today, it could see a return of u00a31.50 or us$1.50 in the medium term. as a result, the boost to national income a country gets from increasing public infrastructure investment can, if done correctly, pay for itself without adding to the debt burden, she points out. however, the true benefits of infrastructure spending depend on three factors, says ocarroll. first, there is the amount of slack in the economy and behaviour of central banks  where there is plenty of spare capacity, there is also less risk that extra spending will feed into higher prices. and when monetary policy is in stimulus mode, interest rates are less likely to rise in response to the pick-up in spending. this reduces the risk that public investment merely crowds out private sector activity, leaving the overall economy no better off, she adds. second, there is the efficiency of public investment. the more efficient the process, from project identification to delivery, the greater the ultimate benefit will be to the economy. finally, there is the issue of how the investment is financed. the international monetary funds (imf) debt-financed investments have had a greater economic impact than those financed by raising taxes or cutting other forms of spending. however, despite these factors, public investment has fallen in the developed markets to 3% of gdp from about 4% in the 1980s. while some of the decline may be the result of the private sectors growing role in infrastructure, such as energy and telecommunications, private investment has also fallen as a share of output in the past three decades, says ocarroll. one fundamental cause lies behind governments underwhelming response. ultimately, infrastructure projects are often large and capital intensive. upfront costs are sizeable, but the benefits tend to accrue only over the long term. so, where countries debt burdens are already high  as many are in the wake of the financial crisis  and the returns on investment drawn out and uncertain, financial markets could take fright, she says. financing costs could rise, increasing the debt burden and leading to a self-fulfilling vicious cycle. at the same time, concerns about inefficiencies in the public investment process and the contentious nature of some projects may stall some much-needed investment before they even get off the ground. nonetheless, as the imf has pointed out, it is time for an infrastructure push, says ocarroll. public infrastructure investment not only provides a short-term lift to demand, it also helps economies grow faster without hitting capacity constraints. moreover, increased infrastructure spending could help relieve the policy burden borne by central banks.    infrastructure funds retail investors can buy into infrastructure assets via unit trust funds. for instance, affin hwang asset management bhds affin hwang select asia pacific ex-japan reits and infrastructure fund gives retail investors access to real estate investment trusts and infrastructure-related stocks in the region. we believe that the flexibility of this fund will benefit investors given the current support for income-yielding assets. it has seen a steady growth in interest and has provided investors with consistent returns since affin hwang asset management took over the management of the fund in march 2012, having recorded an annualised return of 11.8% per annum as at oct 31, says senior portfolio manager chow kar tzen. according to the funds fact sheet as at end-october, its top 10 holdings were china mobile ltd, ct environment group ltd, hkbn ltd, mapletree greater china, china state construction international holdings ltd, frasers logistics & industrial trust, anhui conch cement co ltd, china maple leaf education system ltd, cemex holdings philippines inc and china longyuan power group corp ltd. chow says the funds performance is due to the fund managers ability to manage risk and reduce its market exposure to more defensive positions during adverse market conditions. we believe that it is important to focus on quality investments as we continuously build a portfolio of investments that are sustainable for the medium to longer-term investment horizons of our investors. other infrastructure funds that retail investors can look at include the hong leong asia-pacific infrastructure fund managed by hong leong asset management bhd and public far-east telco & infrastructure fund managed by public mutual bhd. however, according to the fund factsheets, the funds have registered negative one-year returns of -2.08 (as at end-october) and -10.95% (as at end-april) respectively.    tapping the infrastructure boom danny chang, head of managed investments and products management (wealth management) at standard chartered bank malaysia, says the bank is keen on some of the spin-off sectors resulting from infrastructure investments, rather than investing directly in the sector itself. the whole infrastructure spending that us president-elect donald trump spoke about has shifted interest rate expectations and bond yields globally. the 10-year us treasury yield has moved up sharply. it has moved upwards before, but what the market is reading is the stronger inflation expectation this time around, says chang. the stronger inflation expectation is obviously due to talk about the us wage growth  now in excess of 2%. it is not very high, but if you keep in mind that the target inflation rate for the us federal reserve is 2% to 3%, it is in the hitting range already, he adds. chang believes that wage growth and the employment rate are driving inflation in the us. and this will continue to drive up us treasury yields. is this sustainable? the employment and wage growth numbers indicate that the trend will continue, he says. he adds that banking is one of the sectors that will benefit from this trend. even the yield curve is moving up in expectation of higher interest rates. one of the sectors that will benefit is the financial sector, particularly in the us. that is because banks books are funded on the long end using treasury bills or treasury bonds, explains chang. the banks are used to an annual yield of 1.2% to 1.5%. but post-trump, this will rise to 2.3%  they are getting almost 100 basis points (bps) of extra yield. from there, banks balance sheets will improve. so, it is safe to say that the us financial sector will walk away from this as a major beneficiary, he says. an immediate effect with the yield curve steepening in the us is that it is a little more attractive to hold us treasury bonds now. chang says when people start holding treasuries, it means they have to start converting in the us dollar and this will lead to a stronger greenback. we are already seeing the spillover happen. a stronger us dollar will be the second beneficiary. with a stronger dollar, needless to say, any asset priced in it  a us dollar bond for instance  will be worth holding on to, he points out. however, fixed income comes with the major risk of a yield curve steepening. chang says when the interest rate or yield curve move upwards, bonds with longer tenors will get hit the most. typically, if you are holding a 10-year bond and the interest rate or yield curve moves up by 50bps, almost immediately, the 10-year bond will see a decline of about 5%  that is the broad rule of thumb. put another way, if you are holding a 10-year bond and the interest rate or yield curve goes up by 100bps, the impact drawdown on your bond will be about 9% to 10%. so, the longer term the bond, the more you will be impacted. that is why when the yield curve steepens, investors should not be at the long end of fixed income, says chang. shorter-term bonds will be a better choice. in case the us inflation rate does carry through, investors may want to hold real assets as they typically provide better inflation protection than paper assets, says chang. he adds real estate could be one sector that will benefit from the yield curve steepening. but this is obviously going to happen over a longer-term cycle, say, beyond two years. nonetheless, there are ways to play the real estate game without actually buying properties, says chang. for instance, investors can buy mortgage-backed securities (mbs). the mbs may be agency or government-backed, as opposed to non-agency or non-government-backed. during the subprime crisis, the mbs were not government-backed. chang suggests that investors consider us government-backed mbs as a way to access real estate in the us. with us employment nearly full and interest rates still low, the risk of a default for these underlying mbs is going to get lower. separately, another risk of mbs is prepayment risk or early settlement of these mortgages by the borrower. with us interest rates not expected to fall, the prepayment risk will also be lower  a positive for the mbs investor, he says."}, "130": {"date_posted":

operating environment, he says the company is focused on growing its intellectual property (ip) business. its always in our plan to acquire a new ip in addition to disneys marvel avengers and hasbros transformers. this new ip must have a proven track record. we base acquiring a new ip on two important criteria  movies with sequels and which have over us$1 billion gross earnings, tan says. china remains an important market for the group in addition to its current focus on las vegas. tie-ups with strategic partners for future expansion in china is important. we are targeting our kick-off into that market in 2017 when we roll out the transformers travelling set. the north asian market has potential and we want to expand further into that market, he adds. singapore-listed cityneon has four core businesses  exhibition services, experiential environment, event management and interior architecture. of the four, exhibition services are the only business that achieved profit growth in the first six months ended june 30. also, cityneons relatively new ip business recorded a revenue of s$10.2 million in the six-month period. this followed its acquisition of victory hill exhibitions pte ltd in september last year. the revenue was generated mainly by exhibitions  both travelling and permanent. victory hill holds the rights to operate, market and promote the marvel exhibits for display in museums and science centres or other similar venues. the marvel characters include the hulk, captain america, iron man, thor and spiderman. victory hill also has the exclusive rights to use the transformers brand for the development, staging, production, promotion and advertisement of the exhibits. in the six months ended june 30, cityneon posted a profit of s$2.9 million, turning around from a loss of s$638,000 a year earlier. revenue rose 13.8% year on year to s$46.3 million during the period. cityneons share price hit a 52-week high of s$1.19 on nov 1. its 52-week low of 21 singapore cents was recorded nearly a year ago. the counter closed at s$1.09 last tuesday. star had entered the events and exhibition industry through cityneon in 2008. this division was the only one to record revenue growth in the nine months ended sept 30 (9mfy2016). it registered a profit before tax of rm16.31 million compared with a loss before tax of rm3.62 million in the previous corresponding period. revenue grew marginally to rm203.75 million from rm200.8 million, mainly due to the exhibitions held by cityneon and its ip. in the events and exhibition segment, cityneon will continue to look for new opportunities to grow its revenue base. victory hill is expected to diversify the revenue stream and enhance its performance in the foreseeable future via exhibitions for avengers station and transformers. this exhibition is currently in treasure island, las vegas, and the singapore science centre and will be extended to taipei, followed by australia, next year, star explains in notes accompanying its financial results. stars revenue in the third quarter ended sept 30 fell 18.9% year on year to rm206.5 million mainly due to lower earnings in most of its business segments. net profit fell 52% to rm11.31 million. in 9mfy2016, the groups revenue dropped 9% year on year to rm671.77 million because of a drop in newspaper earnings. net profit fell 15.6% to rm70.47 million. maybank investment bank research maintains its earnings estimates for star. it has a hold recommendation on the stock and a target price of rm2.35. moving forward, we do not expect print adex to recover markedly in 4q2016 due to poor consumer sentiment. as star recently launched its over-the-top product dimsum.my, we are keen to hear managements earnings outlook on it. note that we have not imputed any contributions from dimsum.my yet. also, we are keen to hear if star will continue to declare a dps of 18 sen per annum as our estimates imply a dividend payout ratio of 144% for fy2016e, the research house says in a nov 22 report.

drop in profit comes amid slowing loan growth at home and exposure to the oil and gas industry that has been hit by falling prices. thus, it lowered its full-year estimate for loan growth to 2u20133%

yesterday. the dollar surged to a near 14-year high before pulling back on thursday, clocking up records against a range of other top world currencies and skittling emerging markets, according to reuters. stronger data from the world's biggest economy had underpinned the greenback's gains, which were further amplified by thinner volumes as u.s. traders stayed away for the thanksgiving holiday, it said. it was off its highs as europe wound down but had earlier pushed its way past more of last year's peaks against the euro to reach $1.0515, with only the march 2015 high of $1.0457 standing in the way of a drive towards parity, said reuters. alliancedbs research in its evening edition thursday said the fbm klci had on nov 24 traded within previous days range to form an inside day bar as market participants chose not to stage an immediate follow through buying interest. it said in the absence of stronger buying and selling interest, the benchmark index was in the red throughout the trading sessions before settling near the days low at 1,624.21 (down 6.17 points 0.38%). in the broader market, losers outnumbered gainers with 452 stocks ending lower and 302 stocks finishing higher. that gave a market breadth of 0.66 indicating the bears were in control, it said. alliancedbs research said the inside day bar indicated a pause in the game play. it said there were buying attempts to prop up the market in the last 3 market days, but those market participants somehow became cautious when the benchmark index crossed into the 1,630 zone. this can be seen from the inability on the part of the market to sustain its position above the 1,630 level. as such, market participants would likely to continue exchanging their stock positions between 1,637 and 1,617 in a non-trending environment for a little while. a shift in market direction from non-trending to trending will be shaping up if the market were to make a higher high. this will subsequently give rise to a higher probability that the resulting short term bullish trend will be stronger, it said.  the research house said a crossover of 1,637 could send the market to the next resistance zone, 1,652 u2013 1,664,

lodin: no, we are not selling assets to pay dividends. it just so happened that the offer to purchase those assets came at a time when our performance was not exciting ... while i [had] made the commitment that we would declare dividends every quarter and at a certain amount. its just a coincidence that it happened when the market was down and revenue was also down. even during the good times, i would have done the same thing if the same offer had been made to me, for example, the purchase of the quarry land in kulai. the sale of 30% of the jendela hikmat project just came in last year. it came at the right time and it was an offer that i found difficult to refuse. i didnt have control by holding 30% and, at that price, i would be making so much profit compared to what i had paid to acquire it earlier on, so why not? so its not because [we needed] to pay the dividends ... because i also had the objective to reduce gearing. my target is 0.6 [times].  what is the timeline for the gearing target? it is 0.9 times now. the target is 0.6 times within the next 15 months to two years.  the dividend rate for lembaga tabung angkatan tentera (ltat) was 12% last year. will you be able to sustain that this year, and going forward? i hope so. but its tough going. the market is not that exciting and, in past years, we made decent profits from trading in the stock market. but [if] we look at the prices of blue chips such as maybank bhd and cimb group holdings, they have come down so much. there are very few counters that are doing well and its difficult for us to make a good profit from the stock market. so we have to depend more on dividends and other sources of contribution.  would you reconsider bousteads dividend policy if things do not improve as you expect? well, its not a policy statement but we have indicated to our shareholders that we will continue to declare at least 70% of our net profits. and we will honour that. early this year or late last year, it went up to 90%, i think. again, its a balance. if we dont need the money and the banks are not pressing for payment on some of the loans, then we will just give it to shareholders. they have been loyal to us and its right that we repay their loyalty in the form of good dividends. i hope to continue that policy, if possible u2026 to give back more. this [coming] quarterly payment, i think we will continue with that. sometimes, my finance director scratches his head [over this] and, unfortunately, hes got no more hair now (laughs). this is a commitment i made to my shareholders. we do not declare dividends on unrealised profit  that we do not do. its based on realised profit. some people, they do it through window dressing and all that, but we dont do that. there must be proper realisation of profit for us to declare dividends.  are you under pressure to declare dividends at the boustead level? well, not under pressure, no. but i would like to see [dividend payments] u2026 because it benefits me as a shareholder also. but ive got to be fair. just declaring dividends to fulfil my need to pay my interest or my principal, thats not fair. fair in the sense that we have excess money that we can give back to shareholders. and as ive said, its got to be related also to the gearing level. if we can maintain the gearing level at 0.6 [times] and weve got excess cash that enables me to declare 5% to 6% ... i would do it. so its a question of how you balance your cash flow, your profit and so on. the whole idea is that our operation must be carried out on a sustainable basis at every level, be it at revenue, profit, cash flow, gearing and so on.  do you think the high gearing is due to the overexpansion of the past few years? possibly, yes. not only that, cheap money [too]. why do i need to bother the shareholders when i can get loans at 4% to 5% with a return of 12% to 13%? so, its purely based on cost of funds. and im not sure if this will change much in the next six months unless the us federal reserves (janet) yellen raises interest rates. so why should you impose upon the shareholders when you can get cheap funds from the market? thats what weve been doing. but the project must be viable and be able to pay for itself, at least u2026 servicing the loans.  has any shareholder come up to you during annual general meetings and say, please keep this dividend money and use it to repay borrowings? no. i cant recall. theyre asking for more and more (laughs).  would it make sense to reduce the dividend payments for one or two years, bring down gearing and then raise them back to the normal level? i view every project undertaken by the group on a standalone basis, in the sense that the project must be able to support itself. and this includes determining what sort of borrowings level is required. and theyve got to incorporate it into the cost of funds. then only you can see the true viability of the project. but if theyre going to get easy money from the shareholders, then the proposal may be a bit misleading. i always work on the concept of setting the gearing at any level. but if you can do it on 100% gearing without support from the group, it is even better. so you are using the banks money to produce profit with no capital required from the group, which to me is probably the most interesting proposition to the group. the less [of the] groups money you use, the better it is. thats how we evaluate business proposals. but if you need the groups support, then it must be at the proportion of capital and borrowings.  what other assets do you plan to dispose of? i am not going to be sentimental about assets. if you come to me with a price at a multiple of book value, i am quite prepared to consider. it is a question of achieving the balance of having a strong cash flow and sustainability of revenue and profits. we are not desperate to sell assets. [if] a party comes and says, can we buy this piece of land  for example, where a bhp petrol station is located  from which it would take me 15 years to get returns and offers me something that i can earn overnight, i would say yes. we have done it at two or three stations.  so for the next one year, youll continue to dispose of assets and streamline your business? yes, its an ongoing process. disposing of non-core assets and streamlining our business is ongoing. i will not compromise on that. we [can] take on new business, but if after a certain period of time it does not generate the expected returns, then u2026 we have closed down about half a dozen [such businesses] over the past few years. i will not hesitate [to close]. no sentimentality. i give you four or five years, if [there are] no results, thank you very much. if its a joint venture, then we [will] back out. thats our strategy for the last five, ten years, and moving forward.  do you see affin in much better shape now compared with 1997/1998? much, much better. i was involved not only in 1997, but also 1984-85, when i first joined the board. when i first joined the board, it was horror stories all the way u2026 the abuse, mismanagement, the corrupt practices. but today, at the board level, as far as i can see, we have got the risk-management parameters in place, we have a good risk manager, a strong internal audit. on the board, we have a former federal court judge and people with strong corporate and legal backgrounds. so, it is a good combination. i dont expect the bank to be impacted too badly if there is a sudden decline in the economy. it is not like 1997, where we were among the worst hit because of our big exposure to some of the big corporates. the profile of borrowers is quite well spread now  corporates, individuals and so on.  has bank negara malaysia given approval for your reappointment as a non-independent and non-executive director of affin bank? we understand that you also hold board positions in other affin group companies, such as deputy chairman of affin holdings bhd and chairman of affin hwang asset management. have you obtained bank negaras approval for those too? the group is doing some restructuring. my reappointment to some of the board seats is presently being handled by affin holdings.  what is your view on what people have been saying regarding the next consolidation in the banking industry? we were chosen to be one of the banks. but moving forward, i dont think the government and regulator will want to interfere too much in terms of the number of banks that they want to see operating in this country. one thing is for sure, the number of banks will be determined by market forces. again, one of the elements or determining factors is capital. if you dont have the stamina to invest in the financial institution, if you dont have the patience to wait for the returns in the medium to long term, then probably you will not want to be a player in financial services. so, it has got to be based on whether you have the capacity or stamina to hold on to your investment, and whether you have the ability to sustain for the medium to long term. these are the two factors that will determine whether we are going to have five, six or eight banks. of course, under the financial services act, there is a requirement that individuals can only hold 10%, and institutions can hold up to 20%. at the moment, there is some flexibility.  does boustead have the stamina? yes, we would like to be in the banking group. it is unfortunate that the market price does not reflect the true value, but we believe that [the value] will recover. when the time comes, the value is going to reflect the situation.  so far, has anyone approached you [to buy a stake in affin bank]? not at 10 times book value. we have not made it known to the market that we are up for sale, and no one has approached us.  at the moment, you do not intend to sell? at the moment, no.  you wear many corporate hats. how do you handle those different positions? im very focused on how i conduct myself. if you go through the shareholding, youll find that its all under one group  ltat. ive been with ltat for 35 years. i like what i do there, and i think to some extent, i have contributed quite fairly to the returns that we give to the contributors  averaging about 11% per annum for the last 40 years. so, not bad lah. i didnt take anything from ltat when i decided to take over the position of managing director of boustead holdings u2026 that was in 1990. so even though im still ceo of ltat and boustead holdings is a part of ltat, i dont take anything from ltat in terms of salary and all that. ltat owns almost 60% of boustead. this is my bread and butter, so to speak. where i get money to buy milk for my children and my grandchildren and so on. and under boustead, we have all the other companies youve mentioned  pharmaniaga, bhpetrol, boustead heavy industries corp, boustead naval shipyard sdn bhd  and 20% of affin holdings, in which ltat owns 35%. theyre all related. in some, if not all, of these companies, i was involved in setting up, in listing, in acquiring and carrying out corporate exercises. so i do not want someone to come in and disturb the strategies and game plans that we have prepared or have adopted to ensure that these are all investments that can generate good returns for shareholders and ultimately to ltat and the armed forces personnel. so, the flow-through is very important, the synergy is very important. when we have companies within the same group moving in different directions, its not going to create value or unlock value for the ultimate shareholders. because of my understanding [of] and involvement [in the group] from day one, and due to my continued interest and commitment, i have accepted some of these positions. to me now, money is not the most important thing. its more about seeing through the harmonisation, unlocking of value and the production of results from our investments in all these activities. its just business activities, but all under one group, and the whole idea is to make sure they come up with the best possible returns.  it sounds like bousteads profit prospects are getting better, but why are you offloading your own shares? i dont take money from anywhere. all my money is either borrowed or earned from working here (laughs). its to pay back the bank. i sold a lot recently because bank of nova scotia was pressing for payment. its nothing, its just that they have scaled down their retail activity. they gave me one year, asked me to pay back the loan i took. they were very nice to me, so i said okay lah. i had no choice but to sell the shares even though the price was not very attractive ... it was below book value. ive got no other savings.  so it was not a reflection of what you thought about the groups prospects? no, far from it. and ive got a lot to spare in terms of shares, so why be greedy. recently, there was a rights issue. i had to give an undertaking to take up the rights issue. i did it through borrowed funds and i promised them id pay, so i sold [the shares]. i feel sad because if i had kept the shares, the dividends would have been enough to service the interest and pay part of the loan. but [the share sale] was not an indication of confidence  more to pay back the bank, thats all.

income and cost management arrested declining earnings. dbs group and oversea-chinese banking corporation posted a respective 24% and 25% increase in non-interest income, driven by wealth management fees and net trading income, which helped to mitigate the higher provisions and poor performance in its net interest income. united overseas banks non-interest income fell 5% from the gain on divestment of investment securities in 3qfy15. all three banks reported higher provisions due to the rapid asset quality deterioration, particularly in the o&g sector. ng had earlier highlighted that shrinking chinas trade loans from more attractive onshore borrowing rates would result in a retreat of capital back into singapore or banks would have to find new sources of growth to fill the vacuum. given uobs small china exposure compared with its peers, the bank was likely to be least affected. as such, for loans growth in constant currency terms, uob had the strongest loan growth of 7%,

have been lending out faster at 4% to 5% compared to the system, and the bulk of them were for housing loans in singapore. housing loans grew by 6% to 10% compared with the 3% growth for the system, and ng says he does not rule out the possibility that banks may undercut each other in the pricing for housing loans. as it stands, customer spreads have already fallen across the board between 2.015% and 2.13% in 3qfy16. ng believes the reduced spreads could be due to the lack of a repricing interval from lower rates, a heightened risk environment which is impacting credit spreads and risk premiums, or a higher loan volume that is being driven at the expense of lower loan pricing. to be sure, while loans in singapore have risen by 1% - 2% for dbs and ocbc, ng also pointed out that the weakened economic prospects in singapore have led to the banks seeking growth in other countries. for 3qfy16, dbss lending to others in the region rose 32% y-o-y and was broad-based across geographies and industries. at ocbc, lending to the rest of the world rose 7% in a similar broad based fashion across different industries. for uob, loans in others region rose 16% due in part to the financial

(singpost) with a higher target price of s$1.76 as uob kay hian and maybank kim eng are reiterating their buy calls on the stock, both with price targets of s$1.77. all three research houses have unanimously expressed positive views on singposts recent announcement of its completed joint venture (jv) agreement with alibaba in quantium solutions, which will allow both singpost and alibaba to grow their e-commerce logistics network. they have also highlighted more to come with the info-communications media development authoritys (imda) granting of regulatory approval on alibabas second investment in singpost, to increase its stake in the postal service provider from 10.2% to 14.4%. in a thursday report, cimb analyst jessalynn chen says the latest developments will bring new firepower for [singposts] investment in e-commerce logistics and thus boost logistics earnings growth in the medium term. assuming the entire s$86.2 million proceeds from the jv will be put into investments, spost would have s$223.9m at its disposal to invest in its e-commerce logistics network. we do not rule out further mergers and acquisitions (m&as) or local partnerships, she elaborates.  however, chen thinks there may be a gestation period before investments kick in, such that earnings growth from new investments will only begin to pick up from fy18 onwards. cimb has adjusted its fy17-19f earnings projections to factor in higher logistics revenue growth, higher margins on operational efficiency; a loss of 34% of quantium's earnings; cash proceeds from the two alibaba deals; and an enlarged share base. uob, on the other hand, now expects all eyes to be on singposts dividend policy review, which is currently underway to ensure sustainability, as well as linking it to underlying earnings. while singpost maintained its absolute dividend in 1qfy17, we believe a payout based on underlying net profit would be beneficial to sposts transformation and integration journey as it allows sustainability and reinvestment on business for growth, say uob analysts thai wei ying and andrew chow in a report on friday. the analysts have projected an annual dividend of 3.5-6.3 singaporean cents based on fy17f earnings per share (eps) of 7 cents, assuming an earnings-linked dividend policy. uobs forecasts for the companys earnings remain unchanged at a three-year net profit cagr or 8.5% for fy17-19. we believe current valuation remains attractive as the value of its core mail and property businesses account for 94% of sposts current value per share, which potentially suggests that logistics and e-commerce ventures are undervalued, opine thai and chow. maybank analyst john cheong, too, says the alibaba deals should further strengthen the commitment between both parties and enable singpost to capture more logistics businesses from alibabas and lazadas online platform. with the conclusion of the jv, clarity of the placement timeline and terms of the deals, cheong says the overhang on singposts share price should be lifted as previous concerns regarding the deal and business relationship between singpost and alibaba have now been addressed. the proceeds [from both deals] could help singpost to expand its core business and pare down debt, he adds. as at 12:35 p.m., shares of singpost are up 8 singaporean cents at s$1.60."}, "142": {"date_posted": "26/10/2016", "title": "the edge billion dollar club 2016: sgx tops the banks; tech important for future growth in finance sector", "article": " singapore (oct 26): dbs group holdings, oversea-chinese banking corp and united overseas bank, arguably the most closely followed stocks within the finance sector, did not come out tops in any of the three metrics by which the billion dollar club companies are measured. instead, local bourse operator singapore exchange chalked up the highest return on equity (roe) and pretax profit growth over the three years to 2015. it also had the second-highest stock return over the period, behind insurer great eastern holdings. that easily gave sgx the highest overall score in the category. still, dbs and uob managed relatively high scores in terms of stock return and pre-tax profit growth to be placed second and third overall, respectively. ocbc did better than its two local bank peers in terms of roe, but trailed them on stock return and pre-tax profit growth. its overall score was second from the bottom. to be fair, the last three years have not been the best of times for the banks. their net interest margins have been squeezed by low interest rates, loan growth has been soft, operating costs have been rising, and, recently, there have been more instances of loans turning bad. on top of that, as a linchpin of the economy, banks are heavily regulated and have to comply with increasingly tough capital and liquidity requirements. in fact, there is talk of the weights on risk assets being raised beyond the current basel iii standard. among the assets that could see higher risk weights are a banks trading book, mortgage loans and uncommitted banking lines. none of the three local banks are in any danger of failing to comply with the tougher standards. for instance, all three of them currently have core equity tier 1 capital adequacy ratios of more than 12%. the minimum cet1 ratio laid down by the basel committee on banking supervision is only 4.5% and the minimum cet1 required by the monetary authority of singapore is 6.5%. yet, failing to maintain capital adequacy and liquidity ratios that are significantly above the minimum standard could affect the banks high credit ratings. for instance, dbs and uob have been able to issue covered bonds that have yields lower than their fixed deposit rates. provisions and technology\nagainst this backdrop, profitability at the banks is likely to be determined by two important factors. in the near term, analysts are concerned about provisions for losses, allowances and rising credit costs. for its 2qfy2016, dbs took a s$400 million charge of specific provisions for a single company, swiber holdings. of this, $250 million was drawn from its general provisions. so, for 2qfy2016, dbs made a net charge of s$150 million against its earnings for its exposure to swiber. as oil and gas companies face further stress and lower cash flows, banks are likely to be under pressure to renegotiate loan tenures and covenants, leading to a rise in their provisioning levels, analysts say. among the three local banks, uob is seen as having the most conservative provisioning policy, and having driven up its general provisions in recent years. according to maybank kim eng, the bank now has a bigger general-provision buffer (general provisions/total loans) of 1.5%, versus 1% at ocbc and dbs. uob also has the highest provision coverage of 125.6% versus 112.8% for dbs and 100% for ocbc. in the longer term, the investments that the banks are making in fields such as blockchain, artificial intelligence and biometrics could be important in bringing costs down and accelerating their expansion into new markets and services. this past year, all three banks have announced significant fintech initiatives. yet, these initiatives are more likely to raise costs at the banks in the short term rather than lower them. for instance, uob has said that its cost-to-income ratio is likely to rise by another two to three percentage points over the next two years. all three banks currently have cost-to-income ratios in the mid-40s. derivatives driving sgx\nsgx has been subject to similar trends as the banks. its core securities trading business has suffered in recent years, amid a chorus of complaints from local brokers about reduced trading interest by their traditional clients and even corporate governance standards. in fact, much of its growth in recent years has been fuelled by growing trading volume in derivative contracts by institutions. on aug 22, sgx announced the acquisition of baltic exchange for u00a387 million (s$147.5 million), which its officials say will enable it to boost its commodity derivatives business. analysts expect derivatives to remain an important driver of sgxs growth for a long time to come. derivatives will continue to be the main growth driver until sgx is able to monetise initiatives to improve the securities market microstructure. we believe the results of these priorities would only be visible in the medium to long term. sgx is also working on the regulatory front to further enhance the corporate governance of sgx, notes a recent report by dbs research. meanwhile, operating costs have been rising. and, investments in technology have become more important as it struggles to reposition itself. the trend is for exchanges to become integrated platforms where a broad range of products are easily listed and traded, including products traditionally traded over the counter. sgx is also looking at becoming a clearing house for a wider range of assets and is moving towards a standards- based application programming interface, which would enable it to provide access to other markets and minimise the likelihood of customers switching to its competitors. interestingly, sgx is also subject to stiffening regulation by global bodies such as the bank of international settlements. notably, it was one of the first exchanges to adopt the principles for financial market infrastructure introduced by the committee on payment and settlement systems and the technical committee of the international organization of securities commissions , both under the bis. the new standards are designed to ensure that the essential infrastructure supporting global financial markets is better placed to withstand financial shocks than the current system. they contain principles pertaining to systemically important payment systems, central securities depositories, securities settlement systems, central counterparties and trade repositories. another important regulation is to incentivise trading on exchanges and clearing by central counterparties while imposing higher capital requirements on non-centrally cleared contracts. sgx is certified as a qualifying counterparty under the basel iii framework. while the ultimate goal of the regulators is the establishment of sustainable and stable markets, the pace of introduction of the many new and previously untested regulations may cause unintended consequences in the markets in the near term, sgxs letter to shareholders says. nevertheless, the nature of sgxs business enables it to generate an roe that is almost three times that of the banks, despite having an ungeared balance sheet. it also has a track record of paying out most of its earnings as dividends, providing investors with a high certainty of return. for its fy2016 ended june 30, sgxs dividend payout ratio was 85.9%. by comparison, the banks typically have dividend payout ratios that are well under 50%. \nthe edge singapore has started giving the largest locally listed companies special coverage and recognition under the billion

its stock. rmg launched its new raffles holland village in june, and is expected to complete works on its raffles hospital extension in the second half of 2017. meanwhile, rmgs joint-venture shanghai hospital is expected to be completed by late 2018. raffles medical had also recently-acquired international sos (isos), a healthcare provider with 10 clinics across china, vietnam and cambodia. with two new medical centres ramping up and two new hospitals coming on-stream over the next two years, we believe raffles medicals growth potential is becoming exciting once again, says rhb analyst juliana cai in a tuesday report. rhb is keeping its buy recommendation on raffles medical with a higher target price of s$1.76, from s$1.70 previously. however, the expansion comes at a cost. dbs group research warns that raffles medical might see slower growth ahead, because of the expansions. we project growth over the next few years to be a tad slower than its historical average, following gestation period from its expansion plans, says dbs lead analyst rachel tan, adding that the counter has reflected its growth potential. dbs is maintaining its hold recommendation on raffles medical with an unchanged target price of s$1.43. while rmgs revenue for the quarter was up 17.5% at s$199.3 million, compared with s$101.5 million the year before, the groups rise in revenue growth was offset by a 23% increase in staff cost. staff cost continues to be under pressure, due to recruitment for holland v, made worse by the higher cost structure at isos, says cimb analyst jonathan seow. taking a 3-year view, we think the staff/cost revenue ratio should remain at an elevated level, as the larger magnitude of the hospital extension further adds to cost pressure. cimb is keeping its reduce rating on raffles medical, but increases its target price to s$1.46, from s$1.41 previously. taking into account the expanding business operations, as well as the new medical centre in raffles holland v, uob kay hian lead analyst andrew chow says it is unsurprising that rmgs costs outpaced its revenue. staff costs as a percentage of turnover rose to 51.5% in 9m16, compared with 49.8% in 9m15, owing to step up in recruitment to support expanding business operations, chow says. in addition, rmgs staff costs were burdened by higher cost structure at isos, with an estimated staff cost/turnover of 60%, compared with 50% in singapore operations. chow says that excluding isos, raffles medical's operating profit in 3q16 would have grown by 4.5%, instead of 0.3%. maybank kim eng analyst john cheong, however, believes that rmgs 3q performance, is in line with expectations and that recent expansions are stacking up well. local operations continued to grow steadily from various expansions, says cheong. management remains positive on its china expansion, due to the countrys underserved population and its incomplete healthcare system. maybank is keeping raffles medical at buy

52-week range of 1,600.92 points to 1,729.13 points. but year to date, it has remained relatively flat, falling 1.6% to close at 1,665.38 last friday. according to inter-pacific securities sdn bhd

trading is the name of the game for 2016, he told the edge financial daily in a telephone interview. pong believes a bottom-up strategy, in which the emphasis is on a given companys performance, is a suitable investment approach in the current environment as it is difficult to predict the overall trend of the market. he also noted that equity investing in 2016 is all about timing. investors who entered the market in january would have seen significant gains, but those who had invested since end-2016 and held on to the stocks would have seen a slight loss, he said. recall that 2016 was a discouraging start for the local bourse, dragged down by the massive sell-off in chinese stocks. the fbm klci fell by 5.4% to 1,600.92 points in just 21 days into the new year. the market staged a

strategy in a flat market, pong added. pong is also of the view that the oil and gas (o&g) sector remains a wild card for investors at this stage despite the opec agreeing to cut production, adding that the us is now the largest oil exporter in the world. should the global supply of oil be successfully reduced, there will be more interest in the fbm klci as a whole, especially in the o&g sector, he added. etiqa insurance & takaful head of research chris eng shares the same sentiment as pong, expecting some excitement to return to the o&g sector if production cuts by opec members manage to sustain oil prices. brent crude oil prices were down 1.2% to us$51.86 (rm215.22) per barrel last friday, while us west texas intermediate futures settled down 1.3% at us$49.81 per barrel. chris also noted that stock picking is best in the current market conditions, adding that liquidity is key when picking companies as the outlook remains uncertain. i am quite positive [on outlook for the stock

volatility. it attributes the unexciting market performance year to date to the lack of recovery in corporate earnings despite their valuations not being cheap at 15.8 times its forward price-earnings ratio. however, nomura sees limited downside from foreign selling in the fbm klci as foreign positioning is quite light at the moment. it expects the fbm klci to end 2016 around 1,680 points and inch modestly up to 1,725 by end-2017. the foreign research house said in an environment of flattish trend returns, low differentiation and low visibility, capturing cyclical ups and downs in the market is an effective way to enhance returns. it said one local catalyst to keep in mind is the timing of elections, expecting gains around the event, usually starting 60 days before the event, to be the best period of upside for the fbm klci. its top stock picks are public bank bhd, rhb bank bhd, tenaga nasional bhd, ijm corp bhd, genting malaysia bhd, malaysia airports holdings bhd, airasia bhd, airasia

large-cap reduce-rated stocks that are best avoided for now. meanwhile, it has an overweight call on the transports and logistics, reits, consumer, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, gaming, hotels and leisure, and telecommunications sectors but is underweight on the o&g and financial sectors. according to maybank investment bank research (maybank ib research), defensive equity positioning is recommended such as investing in high yielding stocks and to position for the 14th general election (ge14) in the country during broad market weakness. the local research firm is of the view that the fbm klci will end the year on a positive note, taking it up to beyond the 1,700-mark with valuations lifted higher on any signs of an early ge14. the fbm klci saw a pretty good start to the october

chairman datuk izham mahmud is the one looking to cede his shareholding in the upstream o&g service provider. the 75-year-old is deleums largest single stockholder, with a 34.57% stake, mostly held through his interests in im holdings sdn bhd and lantas mutiara sdn bhd. maybank investment bank bhd is said to be working on this deal. discussions between izham and syed mokhtars representatives have been going on for about a month. it is unclear what sort of o&g assets syed mokhtar is looking at for him to choose deleum for his new o&g venture, when one of his existing listed entities, mmc corp bhd, already has exposure to the sector. the heavy industry conglomerates subsidiary, mmc oil and gas engineering sdn bhd, is principally involved in engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning of o&g facilities. mmc corp has undergone a restructuring of sorts recently, by relisting its independent power producer malakoff corp bhd. it is also reportedly still keen to take its port business public. deleum, meanwhile, has technical expertise and products for services pertaining to the drilling, production, as well as workover and decommissioning or abandonment of platforms and wells. it also holds the exclusive distributorship rights for us-based sponge-jet incs abrasive blasting media in malaysia, indonesia, singapore, brunei, turkmenistan and iraq. currently possessing a market value of rm424 million, deleums stock closed one sen lower at rm1.06 yesterday. this represented a 54.72% drop from its all-time closing high of rm2.341 in april 2014, just months before crude oil prices started to fall. the company seems to be in a better financial health when compared with many other o&g players, with net cash from operating activities still positive as at june 30, 2016. after deducting the rm106.79 million cash in hand, deleums total borrowings of rm124.93 million would mean a net gearing ratio of only 0.06 times. the o&g industry might still be shunned by many investors in malaysia, but iran could be in the spotlight going forward. rebuilding from the ravages of decades-long economic sanctions, iran managed to escape from having to cut its crude oil output after other opec members decided to do so to resuscitate prolonged depressed oil prices. bloomberg on tuesday also reported that national iranian oil co (nioc) had agreed to the

hospital. maybank also found a shortage of skilled specialist doctors in johor, due to government policy restrictions on foreign doctors. this has led many johor patients to continue seeking treatment in singapore and kuala lumpur. in an unrated report on sunday, analyst john cheong says the findings bode well for singapores healthcare industry, which should continue to see healthy domestic and premium foreign demand. as such, cheong recommends buying raffles medical, which is expected to perform better in 2hfy16 from the ramp-up of orchard medical centre and rental income from holland village, and q&m dental which is expected to see a boost from its spin-offs and expansion plans. meanwhile, hmi has been working hard to shake off the negative perception by offering an independent

outlook for mahb  analysts", "article": "  kuala lumpur: analysts see a bright outlook for malaysia airports holdings bhd (mahb), in contrast with the situation not too long ago when investors turned bearish on the airport operator. the stock got a much-needed boost last week after news emerged that a higher airport tax is set to be implemented. elsewhere in the aviation sector, airasia bhd continues be viewed positively by analysts while its sister airasia x bhd (aax) gets a more mixed rating. mahb shares surged last week after the government confirmed that revised passenger service charges (pscs) will be imposed from january, although the counter ended the week off highs on profit-taking. in his note to investors last week, before the official confirmation of the upcoming revised psc, maybank ib research aviation analyst mohshin aziz said the probability of higher airport charges to be approved by the government was increasing. the department of civil aviation (dca) will table a motion in the october 2016 parliament sitting to raise its fees, he said. we believe that it will be approved and this will likely set a precedent for the aviation industry to be more market-driven, self-financing and adopt best global practices. he said mahb shares had undergone a bad second quarter after the failed military coup in turkey affected passenger numbers at its istanbul sabiha gokcen international airport. the counter was also hit after the government said it may consider making airport terminals off limits to the public. thankfully, all [that] has passed and the future is looking far more optimistic [for mahb], said mohshin. as for airasia, while the euphoria over a possible bumper dividend from the disposal of its aircraft leasing business has waned, midf research transport and logistics analyst tay yow ken said there are still other catalysts that could fuel the stocks prospects moving forward. airasia has had a very good run this year already, but we still have a buy call on it, he told the edge financial daily. one reason is the potential turnaround of its indonesian and philippine operations. the demand is there in these two places ... it is just a matter of how to manage their operating costs more efficiently, he said. tay had a neutral call on aax, adding, however, that overall both airasia companies can benefit from better yields due to a more rational competition environment this year. tourist numbers have gone up, according to data from the ministry of tourism, while capacity added to the market did not go up a lot, he said. another analyst, who declined to be named, however does not see much catalyst for aax. new routes may cause some short-term excitement, but this is driven by publicity and marketing. new routes usually require a one-year gestation period, which means that a particular route has to withstand 12 months of losses before making money. they need time to fill the plane [and] spread the awareness unless it is an untapped market, where demand is already there but no airliners are aware of it so far, he said. earlier this month, airasia group chief executive officer tan sri tony fernandes said aax will be flying to istanbul by next year, and will resume flights to london by the end of 2018. maybanks mohshin said the biggest issue affecting the future of the aviation industry in malaysia is the overlapping objectives of the respective parties. he noted that airlines want a sustainable profit growth environment, which means low cost from all angles. the regulators, namely the dca and the malaysian aviation commission, on the other hand need to be self-financing, which means they have to raise the fees imposed on airlines or passengers, or both. the government, meanwhile, wants more revenue and also higher tourist arrivals, while air travellers want good quality service at an affordable price. to find a balance will be challenging, assuming it is at all possible, said moshin.

of its hong kong-listed one media group ltd. there is a hk$498.06 million price tag on the deal with mcil estimating that it will make a net gain of hk$363.3 million from the sale of its 73.01% stake in one media to chinese state-owned company qingdao west coast. mcil will also save hk$11.45 million on interest when some of the cash proceeds are used to pay off part of the groups borrowings. however, the completion of the proposed disposal hinges on several conditions, including mcil buying back all of one medias businesses except the ming pao weekly magazine in hong kong and its relevant digital business at a later date. the price of the buyback was not disclosed in the aug 1 bursa malaysia announcement. one media boasts five titles in its stable: the ming watch magazine in hong kong and china and the topgear magazine in hong kong and taiwan, apart from ming pao weekly. it is understood that the parties are still discussing the details of the buyback. they are still in discussion ... but they will have to finalise the details soon as they will have to submit the circular to bursa in about two months, a person familiar with the matter tells the edge. details of the buyback of one medias businesses are crucial to determine the net effects and benefits of the whole exercise, say analysts. what this means is that the hk$363 million estimated net gain and hk$498 million made by mcil from this proposed disposal might be less, or more in the best-case scenario, should it acquire back the businesses from one media ... not many people realise this, says a media analyst at a local bank covering the stock. in an aug 2 note to clients, maybank investment bank research says due to the lack of details on the connected disposal (cp) agreement, it is unable to quantify yet the net sales proceeds attributable to mcil. we suspect that the businesses that will be acquired back are loss-making. therefore, our previous estimate of a 4% to 5% earnings per share accretion in the financial years ending march 31, 2017 to 2019 (fy2017-fy2019) from the disposal of one media may not materialise. overall, we are still positive on the development but not overly excited, it adds. maybank ib research is maintaining its estimates for now, recommending a hold on mcil and a 73 sen target price. barring unforeseen circumstances, mcil expects the proposed disposal to be completed by the fourth quarter of the year. mcil is a leading chinese-language media group with a product portfolio in southeast asia, greater china and north america comprising dailies. on the home front, the group publishes the top four chinese language newspapers, namely sin chew daily, china press, guan ming daily and nanyang siang pau. mcil is listed on both bursa and the hong kong stock exchange. in an aug 1 filing with bursa, mcil says the proposed disposal will enable it to realise its investment in one media at a premium. it adds that it intends to utilise hk$250 million to pare down debts and the remaining sum for working capital and investments, including but not limited to the expansion of its digital media business. mcils shares closed at a 52-week high of 76 sen last monday following a five-day suspension prior to the announcement of the proposed disposal. they had hit a 52-week low of 47.1 sen on aug 26 last year. week on week, mcil closed 0.68% lower at 73 sen last friday, giving the company a market capitalisation of rm1.23 billion. mcil had a net cash position of rm100 million as at march 31. its net profit dropped 15.2% year on year to rm103.98 million in fy2016 while revenue fell 18.6% to rm1.36 billion. the media company blamed the poorer results on a weaker ringgit and canadian dollar against the us dollar during the year under review, which resulted in higher newsprint prices. one media saw its net loss widen to hk$15.6 million in fy2016 from hk$11.1 million in fy2015 while revenue declined to hk$137.2 million from hk$179.2 million. in its fy2016 annual report, mcil notes that total gross advertising spending in hong kong fell 2.2% during the year under review, citing the research data of admango. digital media is getting more popular among advertisers and the hong kong markets online advertising expenditure for 2015/2016 reported a growth of 14.4% on the mobile and interactive platforms. on the other hand, advertising expenditure for paid newspapers decreased by 0.3% and spending on magazines dropped 18.4%, it states. recognising the challenging operating landscape for traditional media, mcil is changing its business model by diversifying its income base and actively venturing into the digital media space. the groups e-papers in malaysia have been on an upward trajectory and based on its data, sin chew daily had achieved a record 88,313 e-copies as at march 31, within just two years of being launched in february 2014. at its agm last year, mcil told its shareholders that it was actively exploring new investment opportunities, including e-retail, education, property development and big data marketing.

have boded well for some financial instruments and asset prices around the world. esther teo, head of fixed income at affin hwang asset management bhd, says whenever central banks deliver these goodies, the financial markets react positively. risk assets will perform when they ease or there are announcements of a quantitative easing (qe) programme. so, the credibility of central banks is intact and people still believe in them. for example, when the ecb announced a bigger qe in march, we saw equities rally. fund flows came into riskier assets. negative rates have triggered a rush for safe-haven assets such as gold, which rallied for the first few months of the year. pacific mutuals teh says the performance and use of gold have been unique following the implementation of negative interest rates. post-global financial crisis, it has behaved in one of three ways. first, the price is inverse to the us dollar  if the dollar strengthens, the gold price, which is in the us dollar, falls. it is also a safe haven. when risk aversion is high, people buy gold. there is demand for us treasuries and dollars. in this case, both the us dollar and the price of gold increase. the third way is behaving like a commodity. in the past, it was not the norm to have gold as a permanent holding in a portfolio. but this is not the case these days. the argument that gold does not generate yield or interest, hence one is always at a disadvantage when investing in gold, no longer holds true when holding cash generates negative or very low returns. i expect the gold price to appreciate in the long term as investors seek diversification or when faith is lost in certain currencies. emerging markets have benefited from the negative interest rate polices and will continue to be the investing destinations of foreign investors. yeah says this part of the world has been a beneficiary because of the tremendous amount of liquidity flowing from advanced markets. malaysia is a direct beneficiary of the funds that are seeking higher yields, that are looking for positive interest rate differential and risk diversification. while most of the flows went into malaysian government bonds, our stock market has also benefited, mainly the blue chips, he adds. on july 26, the average dividend yield for the fbm klci was 3.07%, higher than the msci ac asia ex-japan indexs 2.68% and the dow jones industrial averages 2.5%. affin hwangs teo expects the strong inflows into emerging market bonds to continue in the near term, especially with the expectation that developed market central banks will cut rates again and become more negative. investors would then come to asia, and we have seen that happening. our mgs market has done well. chang says yields on the 10-year mgs have fallen more than 0.5% from 4.2% in late december last year to 3.6% currently. this would make subsequent refinancing of these maturing bonds cheaper for malaysia and emerging markets. the us dollar-ringgit will be another indicator of such negative rate repercussions, with the ringgit strengthening 10% year to date in july, to 4.01 from 4.40 in late 2015. the ringgit surprisingly strengthened in july after bank negara cut the interest rate. one of the reasons why that happened is that the central bank provided reassurance to investors that it was committed to supporting growth and the move was to keep the growth trajectory intact, says rams fong. while that bodes well for the ringgit, sunway universitys yeah points out that there is a higher risk premium for using emerging market currencies such as the ringgit. there is a flight to safety among international investors. they will get out of emerging markets at the first sign of instability and head back when interest rates are raised. so, the shock to emerging market currencies is very much higher, that is why their currencies are much more volatile despite benefiting from the decline in the value. they are used as a safe haven. leong lin-jing, fixed income (asia) investment manager at aberdeen asset management asia ltd, says there will be bouts of risk-off periods that cause a sell-off in malaysian bonds and the ringgit. given the headwinds surrounding 1malaysia development bhd and the high concentration of foreign investors in the market, malaysian bonds are often treated more credit-like these days. on the whole, we do expect to see lower bond yields and ringgit strength more often than not. the more broad-based impact from negative interest rates will translate into lower returns from assets. according to the report, diminishing returns: why investors may need to lower their expectations, released in april by mckinsey global institute, slowing gross domestic product growth and low interest rates mean north american and western european firms will struggle to reward investors with the same returns in the coming decades. in a slow-growth scenario, the total real returns for equities and fixed income in the us and europe over the next two decades are expected to plummet, averaging 4% to 5% for equities and 0% to 1% for fixed income, say the mckinsey researchers. these percentages are lower as equities on both continents have returned an average of 7.9% over the last 30 years while us and european bonds have seen returns of 5% and 5.9% respectively. affin hwangs ng advises investors to lower their target returns for equities, based on their fund performance. our internal targets for equity funds across the spectrum will be in the range of 8% to 12%. previously, we set targets of 12% to 15%. while our flagship funds are still reaping 15% to 16%, we believe things are more challenging now.  assets that will outperform there are still opportunities to be found in asia, assets that will yield positive returns for investors. ahmad najib nazlan, ceo at maybank islamic asset management, says as far as the region is concerned, developed markets will be the place to take cover during the current turbulence. country-wise, the us seems to deliver better earnings prospects, albeit lower on historical perspective. hence, it is considered the most viable safe haven in terms of jurisdictions for investments in the recent years. however, yields in the us have reached historical lows and may not be sustainable in the long run. hence, money may flow out of the us, looking for better yielding assets that compensate for the slightly higher risks, he notes. some stable developing countries  for example, malaysia and south korea  may attract investors looking for better yielding assets after they have exhausted other avenues, such as the us and other developing markets. risks in developed markets are also rising, especially after brexit. hence, stable emerging markets with consistent policies may be attractive places to house assets, which will flourish in the current economic slowdown. pang kin weng, multi-asset fund manager at schroder investment management (singapore) ltd, expects positive global growth this year and thus, believes there are still equity sectors producing positive earnings. low interest rates, when combined with growth, create good investment opportunities. for instance, utilities and infrastructure companies have a steady stream of earnings that stretch out over several years, and these multi-year revenue streams are examples of positive returns supported by the structure of the industry and are laid out in contractual terms, he says. high-yielding markets can typically be found in developed parts of asia-pacific, such as australia, singapore and hong kong. utilities in australia and hong kong are still offering attractive yields despite outperforming the broader market. from an investment perspective, it is important to take a longer time horizon. identifying and combining investment assets in a diversified portfolio will provide more stable returns.  bullish on currencies affin hwangs teo remains bullish on emerging market currencies in asia. these currencies have been performing because the us dollar has been weak, owing to expectations that the fed will not hike rates until next year. but the economic data coming out of the us is improving and remains quite strong, so i think it is in the position to hike interest rates as early as september. if that happens, we will see a stronger us dollar. we think the ringgit could trade on the stronger side (despite bank negara cutting rates) barring any 1mdb headlines. it is not only negative interest rates but also commodities that will play a role in the direction of the ringgit. this quarter, we are looking at the currency trading at 3.8 to 4 against the us dollar. those who are considering currencies can look at the greenback, which is set to see a modest appreciation. however, menon says retail investors should avoid currencies because of their volatility. retail investors may want to stay away, but high-net-worth individuals can consider currencies. if you are a 12-month investor, consider the us dollar. in the next year or so, i think it will see a modest appreciation. while the currency appreciated about 27% between 2014 and 2015, i do not think you will see double-digit appreciation anymore, he adds. while the pound sterling has weakened, menon thinks it is too early to go into the currency due to the brexit fallout. it is still too early because things are still playing out. at this point, the pound is 1.32 against the us dollar, but you do not know what will happen in the future. if there is a trade spat between europe and the uk, all that will weigh on the currency. menon does not expect the yen to strengthen any further. the yen has strengthened a lot, but i would not bet on it to appreciate further from here. the line in the sand is u00a5100 to the us dollar. the yen has not successfully broken through those levels yet because there is talk that the boj will intervene when the currency hovers over these levels, he says. for ringgit bonds, teo says the company aims to achieve between 5% and 5.5% returns this year. this year has been quite a good one. for our asian bond funds, we are looking at 5% to 6%. affin hwangs ng says alternatives that have less mark-to-market risk will be more sought after. one of the investments we advocate to our clients is to find a good bond like the genting singapore perpetual bond, which has a yield of about 4%-plus. that may not seem great, but you know this company is good. mohammad hasif, fixed income (asia) investment manager at aberdeen asset management asia ltd, believes indias local currency bonds still offer positive returns. with 10-year government bond yields in the mid-7%, similarly attractive real yields and an improving fundamental economic picture, indias local currency bonds provide a viable source of positive returns for investors, he says. singapore properties could also be considered by investors, says ng. recently, we introduced a wholesale singapore property fund. singapore property, especially the high-end segment, has seen 11 quarters of declining prices. that is because all of the tightening measures the government has implemented. lately, we have seen an increase of transactions at discounts. that is usually seen as a bottoming of the market. but investors of our fund should have a five to seven-year horizon.  investing in the new abnormal (part 1)investing in the new abnormal (part 3)"}, "162": {"date_posted": "5/8/2016", "title": "triple whammy weighs on ioi corp's 4q earnings", "article": " this article first appeared in corporate, the edge malaysia weekly, on july 18 - 24, 2016. fresh fruit bunch (ffb) production losses due to el niu00f1o, the suspension of its roundtable on sustainable palm oil (rspo) certification from april 4 and foreign exchange losses are expected to weigh on ioi corp bhds earnings for the fourth quarter ended june 30 (4qfy2016), to be released by the end of next month. although cpo spot prices were rm2,506 per tonne on average in the first half of the year, futures prices have plunged 19.2% from rm2,646 per tonne in june to rm2,219 last thursday, in anticipation of rising stockpiles in malaysia. the countrys june inventory level, announced last tuesday, improved 7.9% month on month to 1.78 million tonnes last month, reversing the downward trend seen since last december, due to the seasonal production recovery and lower exports. unless there is an upsurge in exports and domestic usage, analysts generally expect inventory to trend upwards as production growth outpaces demand improvement in the third quarter of the year. as 66% of ioi corps planted landbank is in sabah, the state worse hit by the el niu00f1o event, the companys ffb production declined 23.2% to 525,281 tonnes in the first quarter  the sharpest decline among its peers, according to jp morgan (see chart). this resulted in a 19.2% year-on-year reduction in upstream plantation profits for 3qfy2016 to rm174.8 million, though the 5.9% y-o-y increase in cpo prices in the first quarter helped. on the positive side, the decline in ioi corps ffb production seems to have bottomed out in april. ffb production decreased 27.1% in april but saw a smaller decline of 24.9% in may and 6.4% in june. all in, ffb production for 4qfy2016 fell 19.2% y-o-y to 717,485 tonnes, which more than offset the 18.2% gain seen in cpo prices in the same quarter. although operating profit from downstream manufacturing improved 29.3% to rm119.7 million in 3qfy2016, the segment could face a potential loss in revenue due to the rspo suspension that could kick in in 4qfy2016, though the impact would be more evident from fy2017 onwards as existing contracts are gradually phased out. for fy2015, ioi corp derived 36.4% of its revenue from europe  its biggest market  and 15.1% from the us. to recap, the rspo board of governors made a decision on march 25 to suspend the rspo certification for the entire ioi group following allegations of non-compliance against its indonesian subsidiaries. this led to key customers including unilever, nestlu00e9, mars inc and kelloggs cutting supplies from ioi corp and sourcing them from other rspo-certified suppliers such as kuala lumpur kepong bhd (klk). hit by the suspension, ioi corps shares slumped as much as 19.2% from rm4.96 on march 22 to rm4.16 on may 9. the stock further slid to a 10-month low of rm4.12 on may 16 after the company announced its plan to file a legal challenge against the suspension on may 9. subsequently, in early june, ioi corp withdrew its legal challenge, which could have been complicated and time-consuming. it submitted documents to comply with the conditions set by the rspo for the lifting of the suspension. viewed as a positive development by analysts, the stock has since gained 5.8% to close at rm4.36 last thursday. in a july 13 note to clients, affin hwang capital opines that ioi corps share price may rebound further if the rspo decides to lift the companys certification suspension in its next meeting, possibly later this month. following the downgrade by maybank investment bank research from buy to hold last week, midf research is the only broker that has a buy call on the stock, according to data compiled by bloomberg. we upgrade the stock to buy with a higher target price of rm4.82 as we believe that the timeline for the rspo suspension to be lifted has shortened significantly after the withdrawal of the challenge in court. we believe ioi corps suspension may be lifted in less than a year given its proactive stance, says midf analyst alan lim. since spinning off its properties arm in 2014, ioi corp is one of the purest, most efficient integrated plantation players with 88.3% of planted landbank in malaysia and 11.7% in indonesia. in terms of earnings breakdown, upstream plantation accounted for 64% of its 9mfy2016 operating profit while downstream manufacturing contributed the other 36%. while the lifting of the rspo suspension could be a potential share price catalyst for the counter, maybank ib research analyst ong chee ting estimates that ioi corps upcoming 4qfy2016 earnings are likely to be back in the red, largely due to forex translation losses of about rm140 million on its us dollar debt and possible fair value losses on its derivative instruments. in fy2015, ioi corp saw its pretax profit from continuing operations plunge 72.6% to rm168.1 million from rm1.7 billion the year before, mainly due to forex translation loss of rm735.3 million on borrowings denominated in foreign currency. eighty per cent of its borrowings are denominated in us dollars, followed by yen (10%) and euro (9%). its net gearing ratio stood at 100.5% as at end-march, higher than klks 28.2% and genting plantations bhds 17.4%. nonetheless, ioi corps gearing had eased from 145% as at sept 30 last year, thanks to the strengthening of the ringgit against the greenback. despite the high gearing, the companys return on equity is also the highest in the sector, mainly due to its high ffb yields with 48% of its oil palm plantations in prime age. according to bloomberg data, out of 24 analysts that track the stock, 10 have a hold recommendation while 13 have a sell call due to its premium valuations, elevated earnings risks and high us dollar debt exposure. the stock is currently trading at a two-year median forward price-earnings ratio of about 22.5 times and has a consensus target price of rm4.03, with a downside potential of 6.9%.

upside potential to our revised tp is limited. things have been great for airasia since malaysia airlines bhd cut capacity back in september 2015. this caused a big divergence in the industrys demand-supply dynamics as first half of fy16 (1hfy16) demand grew by 1.5% y-o-y, while supply shrank by 4% to 5% y-o-y. this mismatch favoured airasia immensely, enabling it to capture significant market share and have significant pricing power, especially on routes that it competes with malaysia airlines. 1hfy16s record performance was all about an industry capacity crunch that enabled airasia to enjoy record load factors and strong pricing power. however, aircraft deployment in malaysia reconvened as five aircraft were deployed in june to july, and three to five more will be delivered in 4qfy16. this will rebalance the current industry demand-supply deficit, and ultimately moderate the strong-yield environment. we think the impact will be visible in 3qfy16 and be more distinct from 4qfy16. we believe the current situation is as good as it gets, and the competitive environment will intensify and crimp yields and margins. the stock has surged by 109% year-to-date, making it the

on tuesday, fell short of expectations and triggered a selldown in its shares yesterday, leading to 16 sen or 3.77% being shaved off its stock to settle at rm4.08. net profit contracted 10.4% to rm56.2 million, which accounts for 19.5% of bloombergs consensus estimate for its fy17 results, even though revenue grew 25.4% to rm401.8 million. cimb equity research analyst walter aw said the underperformance was due to lower margins from a decline in average selling prices (asps), especially in the nitrile butadiene rubber (nbr) segment, an overall increase in operating costs, and a weaker us dollar against the ringgit. nevertheless, most research houses remained optimistic that hartalega will see gradual earnings recovery in the coming quarters. one of the main reasons for the underperformance was the below-average utilisation [capacity] rate of 82% during the quarter as a result of some ongoing production issues at some of its plants. we understand that most bottlenecks were resolved in june and the utilisation rate had risen to around 88% during june, and july, an analyst with a local fund house said. she added that a lag in transferring currency and raw material effects, as well as the 17% hike in gas tariff last december, further dragged margins during the quarter. looking ahead, with the gradual ramp-up of next generation integrated glove manufacturing complex, we should see earnings rise, she said. there is also the general view that there will be a slight recovery in nitrile gloves average selling price. aaron kee from affin hwang investment bank shared: our channel checks also indicate a slight recovery in nitrile gloves us dollar asp by up to 5% across the sector in the second quarter. another positive takeaway from hartalegas results announcement is its plan to slow down the commercialisation pace for the incoming capacity of its expansion plans. we are positive on this news as it will enable hartalega to concentrate on recovering its margins from recent volatility in currency, raw material prices and [the] hike in gas tariff. furthermore, we think slower capacity growth will help improve the demand-supply dynamics, midf equity research analyst noor athila mohd razali noted in her research report. while research houses, by and large, remained positive on hartalegas fy17 earnings, bloomberg consensus ratings showed 33% had a sell call on the stock, while 60% kept a hold rating; only one research house had a buy call after its first- quarter earnings were announced. maybank investment bank research analyst lee yen ling told the edge financial daily that while long-term investment is generally a good idea for glove counters, hartalegas valuation of 24 times its 2017 price-earnings ratio remains expensive, despite having fallen by 31.3% year-to-date. aw from cimb equity echoed lees sentiment in his research report: we believe hartalegas current valuations are unjustified, given its non-existent pricing premium and dwindling margins in [the] nbr segment, he added. however, m&a securities analyst choo hock chuan, who has a buy call on hartalega, deemed current latex prices and us dollar-ringgit exchange rates as favourable to hartalega, price competition notwithstanding. a possible interest rate hike in the us in the second half of 2016 that could lift the us dollar against the ringgit, and growing demand

11.13 a.m. it was one of the most actively-traded counter, with 14.88 million shares exchanging hand. knms founder and chief executive officer (ceo) lee swee eng said in a recent interview that he is aiming to grow the groups recurring income from re to 70% of the groups total revenue or earnings in five years.  the first step into re is its ethanol operations in thailand, which will come online by the second half. this will be followed by its peterborough waste-to-energy project.  while fund managers are skeptical on the potential of re, analysts are generally positives on the re venture. i think retail investors may still buy the stock, but institutional is very unlikely due to their unpleasant investing experiences, said midf research analyst aaron tan. knm announced process equipment venture in brazil and waste-to-energy projects in sri lanka in 2008 and 2011 respectively, but both failed to deliver. tan, however, opined that knms target of 70% of the groups recurring income in five years time is achievable, as the group is buying over power assets to provide recurring income, and these power assets are cash generating. but at this point in time, we are prudent and conservative by expecting minimal contributions from the re division. our earnings forecast for fy16 is rm75.7 million, and fy17 is rm82.7 million, he told theedgemarkets.com. tan maintained his buy call with a target price (tp) of 59 sen on knm, as the counter is currently trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9.5 times, which in his opinion is undemanding and reasonable, given its potential future earnings, as wella s its strong orderbook from refinery and petrochemical integrated development project (rapid) projects in pengerang. to tan, knm is a strong contender for more jobs from rapid, as the company is one of the forerunners in the supply of process equipment for petrochemical plants; opportunities are abound as knm is in partnerships with sinopec engineering, tecnicas reunidas sa and toyo engineering, which were appointed as main contractors for the petrochemical plants in rapid. meanwhile, maybank ib researchs analyst liaw thung jong, who has a buy call and tp of

appeared in corporate, the edge malaysia weekly, on june 27 - july 3, 2016. sapurakencana petroleum bhds share price has been sliding steadily for more than a year, in response to the slump in oil prices. and it hit new lows this month. year-to-date, it has lost rm3.72 billion, or about 30% of its market value, reaching rm8.45 billion yesterday. on june 20, its share price fell 15.9% in six days to an all-time low of rm1.38. this came after sapurakencana guided for weaker growth at a june 10 briefing, which prompted some analysts to slash their earnings estimates. the average 12-month target price after the revision was rm1.44, according to bloomberg data. this is slightly more than its closing price of rm1.40 last thursday, which is only 0.82 times its book value. while some market observers view the recent sell-off of sapurakencana shares as overdone, analysts do not expect gains anyu2013time soon as investors continue to shrug off the recovery in oil prices. brent crude, the international oil benchmark, was trading at us$115 a barrel in june 2014, but fell to as low as us$27 in january this year. it is now trading at about us$50 per barrel, up more than 80%. on june 22, khalid al-falih, saudi arabias energy, industry and mineral resources minister, was quoted as saying that the supply glut that had kindled a two-year oil rout around the world has finally vanished. the question now, is how fast will you work off the global inventory overhang, he told the houston chronicle. while most analysts agree that at some point the upside in sapurakencanas share price will come along with the oil price recovery, they are of the view that it will not be sufficient to turn the tide. sapurakencana slipped to a net loss of rm791.56 million for the financial year ended jan 31 (fy2016) from rm1.43 billion in fy2015, due to impairment provisions on oil and gas (o&g) assets totalling rm1.14 billion and a write-off on deposit on acquisition of rm172.5 million. revenue was 2% higher at rm10.18 billion, from rm9.94 billion the previous year. however, it is worth noting that the company remains an integrated o&g service provider and is the largest in the world for tender rig drilling with a diversified exposure in different geographical areas such as brazil and australia and is even looking at india. it also announced a major gas discovery from its three wells within the block sk408 production sharing contract area, off malaysia. the estimated gas discovered is around three trillion cu ft, which bring the total gas reserves to 214.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, while its sk310 b15 gas field off sarawak is expected to achieve its first gas production in the fourth quarter of 2017.  management has turned bearish on the companys near-term prospects, prompting us to cut our fy2017-fy2019 forecast earnings by 42% to 80%, alliancedbs research analyst tan jian yuan says in his june 23 report. he has downgraded the stock to fully valued from buy due to the gloomier outlook, lowering his 12-month target price to rm1.20 from rm2.10 previously. tan says the reduction of the earnings forecast takes into account lower engineering and construction, drilling and energy revenues. while the lumut yard is currently busy fabricating structures, its utilisation rate could fall to 30% to 40% at year-end if there are no new jobs. another concern is sapurakencanas petrobras contract in brazil, where five of its delivered pipe-laying support vessels are operating at a high utilisation rate of close to 100%. petrobras has approached sapurakencana for discounts, in return for changing the initial arrangement of the contract period to a longer firm period. of the five rigs stacked since 4qfy2016, three units are expected to be off-hire for the next 18 months and two units may only see charters in 3qfy2017. of the 11 rigs currently on hire, five contracts will expire in fy2017 and will see gaps in utilisation, should they be successfully extended, at lower daily charter rates, maybank investment bank research analyst liaw thong jung says in a june 13 report. while the revised earnings expectations for fy2017/fy2018 due to weaker market conditions are likely to significantly undermine markets expectations, sapura-kencana is committed to cut costs, preserve cash flows and be capital disciplined, he says. liaw has a hold call on sapurakencana, with a rm1.60 target price. alliancedbs researchs tan estimates that the companys current order book of rm21.3 billion will only provide revenue of rm6.5 billion and rm3.9 billion for fy2017 and fy2018 respectively. sapurakencana currently has us$7 billion (about rm28 billion) of new tenders out in the market. (of this,) 49% tendered for are currently in asia-pacific, with india as the second largest market at 22%. other regions include the americas (17%) and middle east and africa (12%). in order to maintain a stable order book of rm20 billion to rm25 billion, sapurakencana has to secure about rm5 billion of new orders per year. however, the timing of tenders materialising remains uncertain at this juncture. taking into account recent management guidance, we are cautious on the companys near-term contract flow, tan says."}, "170": {"date_posted": "4/7/2016", "title": "maybank says its

first half of 2016 affecting auto sector", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on july 4, 2016.  kuala lumpur: the continuous strengthening of the yen in the first half of 2016 is affecting the profit margin in malaysias automotive industry, but some analysts say the adverse effect could be less pronounced than what the market perceives. according to a sensitivity test by maybank investment bank research, every 1% appreciation in the yens value against the ringgit would impact the net profit of malaysian public-listed vehicle sellers by as much as 3%. the research houses analyst ivan yap, in his report dated june 27, said berjaya auto bhds (bauto) cost of goods sold (cogs) had 32% exposure to yen  the highest among its peers on bursa malaysia. this is followed by tan chong motor holdings bhds 6% cogs exposure to yen, and perusahaan otomobil kedua sdn bhd (perodua), which 3% of its cogs is denominated in yen. umw holdings bhd owns a 38% stake in perodua, while mbm resources bhd has a 22.6% shareholding in the leading local car manufacturer. ta securities research analyst abel goon told the edge financial daily that the adverse impact of the stronger yen on the automotive industry may not be as negative as perceived by the market. in the case of bauto, for instance, goon said the foreign-exchange (forex) risk on the mazda vehicle distributor is largely borne by its 30%-owned associate company, mazda malaysia sdn bhd. bautos sales comprise mainly ckd (complete knocked-down) units, where the company buys these ckd kits from mazda malaysia. what we understand from management is that mazda malaysia will be the one that bears all the forex risk, he explained. mazda malaysia is 70%-owned by mazda motor corp itself, and 30%-owned by bermaz motor sdn bhd, which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of bauto. but of course, bauto has to sell their cbu (complete built-up) units as well. so they are affected by the yen appreciation, but may not be as bad as widely perceived, goon added. nevertheless, goon is not optimistic about the automotive industrys outlook, as consumer sentiment is weak, and the difficulties in securing car loans from banks are expected to persist for at least the remaining part of the year. hong leong investment bank research analyst daniel wong concurred, and said that the automotive industry had gone from bad to worse in 2016. we expected things to recover, or at least maintain in the second quarter of this year, but the numbers are not showing that. in fact, first-half-of-2016 numbers came in much below expectations, he said. people are not willing to spend on big-ticket items, plus there is no catalyst for any recovery yet, he added. according to data from the malaysian automotive association, the total industry volume fell 17.63% to 218,200 units in the first five months of 2016, from 264,900 units in the same period last year. wong is therefore telling investors not to have any exposure to the automotive sector, unless they are willing to hold for more than 12 months. still, wong is prepared to recommend a stock in the sector, saying he would opt for bauto. they may incur higher cogs moving forward, but the good thing is unlike other brands, mazda does not need to give a lot of discounts, as their sales are still strong, which help sustain margins, he said, adding that bauto also reported strong vehicle sales in its philippine operation. for the fourth quarter ended april 30, 2016, bautos net profit fell 6.6% to rm51.62 million, from rm55.26 million a year ago, despite revenue rising 26% to rm534.71 million from rm424.34 million. bautos philippine operation, on the other hand, recorded a pre-tax profit of rm15.3 million, more than double the rm6.7 million it posted for the same quarter last year. year to date, bautos share price has gained some 10%, while counters like mbm resources, umw holdings, tan chong motors and drb-hicom bhd saw their share prices fall by as much as 29% in the same period. last friday, bautos share price closed two sen or 0.86% lower at rm2.30, giving it a market capitalisation of rm2.63 billion."},

{"date_posted": "27/6/2016", "title": "lead story: analysts turn positive on banks, aviation and reits", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on june 20 - 26, 2016. companies that have reported their first quarter (1q) results have, by and large, seen disappointing earnings. data compiled by the edge show that most sectors reported negative earnings growth, with the consumer discretionary and energy sectors seeing their earnings plunge 97.9% and 83.5% year on year (y-o-y) respectively (see chart 1). as a result, market valuations have gone up, with the trailing price-earnings ratio for the fbm klci now standing at 18 times from 17.5 times a year ago. as malaysias gross domestic product (gdp) growth slowed to 4.2% in 1q2016  the lowest y-o-y growth since the global financial crisis  cyclical sectors such as banking, property, automobile and oil and gas are expected to continue to face earnings downside risks. in 1q2016, banks earnings declined 3.3% y-o-y, dragged down by higher provisions for bad loans, while non-bank earnings fell 22.2%, impacted by slower sales and rising operating cost. overall corporate earnings contracted 18.2% or rm4.1 billion, with only industrials and healthcare posting better 1q results. as shown in table 1, the main culprits of the dismal results were automobile manufacturers (-rm1.1 billion), oil and gas firms (-rm578.7 million) and property developers (-rm422.6 million). another key observation is that the underperforming sectors were generally the bigger-cap sectors. however, one caveat to note is that the reported earnings data in the table were not normalised, that is they were not adjusted for exceptional items. although electric utilities, casinos and gaming, and plantation were among the worst-performing sectors, the huge reduction in earnings was due to extraordinary items. for example, kulim (m) bhd saw its 1q earnings decline rm1.4 billion due to a rm1.3 billion gain arising from the disposal of new britain palm oil ltd in the previous corresponding quarter. tenaga nasional bhds (tnb) 1q net profit decreased rm835.5 million, largely due to an imbalance cost pass-through mechanism, while genting bhd reported an earnings decline of rm489.3 million, mainly due to disposal gains on financial assets and the reversal of impairment losses in the preceding quarter. while the overall picture is not exactly pretty, there are still some sectors that posted improved earnings, namely airlines (better passenger yields and low fuel cost), metals (recovery in metal prices), hospital operators (higher number of patient admissions), glove makers (ongoing capacity expansion), non-wireless telecommunications (growing broadband subscriber base), marine ports (higher container volume and tariff), real estate investment trusts (reits) (positive rental revisions and benign interest rates), brewery (improved cost efficiencies) and packaged foods and beverages (subdued milk powder prices). for shipping and industrial conglomerates, the jump in earnings was mostly due to exceptional items such as the recognition of compensation for early termination of time charter contracts for vessels and disposal gains on businesses and land. in examining the top 15 sectors that performed the best in terms of year-to-date share performance (see table 2), it can be seen that corporate earnings are still the key determinant of share price. nine out of the 15 sectors  airlines, aluminium, soft drinks, retail reits, diversified reits, marine ports, packaged foods, breweries and steel  that posted better 1q results saw their share price continue to rise in may. in the first quarter, shares of large-cap sectors such as airport services, casinos and gaming, industrial conglomerates and banking rallied, thanks to foreign fund inflows that sought to capitalise on the undervalued ringgit. nonetheless, their stocks faced selling pressures after reporting weaker earnings in may, though they were also partially affected by the reduced weightage in the msci indices. table 2 also lists the sector leader that contributed the largest market value to its respective sector. despite the foreign selldown in the last two months, overall disappointing earnings reports and gloomy economic data, these 15 stocks continued to beat the benchmark fbm klci and outperform the market. industry-leading stocks that continued to do well in may included airasia bhd (+100.8% year-to-date return), press metal bhd (+56.5%), fraser & neave holdings bhd (+37.2%), igb reit (+15.7%), klccp stapled group (+4.5%), kerjaya prospek group bhd (+28.2%), westports holdings bhd (+2.9%) and nestlu00e9 (m) bhd (+4.9%). in contrast, industry-leading stocks that faced selling pressure in may, either due to the exit of foreign liquidity or weaker 1q results, included malaysia airports holdings bhd (+15%), heineken malaysia bhd (+14.9%), ann joo resources bhd (+73.1%), tnb (+4.8%), genting bhd (+10.4%), hap seng consolidated bhd (+16.8%) and public bank bhd (+3.5%). moving forward, analysts believe corporate earnings will remain weak in 2q or 3q, thereby limiting further upside on the fbm klci. in a note to clients this month, alliancedbs research head of research bernard ching says the prospect of weak corporate earnings will remain the achilles heel of malaysian equities. heavyweight sectors such as telecoms and plantations continued to face earnings risk from intense competition and poor fresh fruit bunch (ffb) yield respectively. while the banking sector has, by and large, held up in the 1q2016 earnings season, selective corporate account exposure still led to asset quality concerns in maybank but this is unlikely to point towards systemic risks in the sector, he says. given the lack of broad-based rerating catalysts for the market and the negative bias in corporate earnings revisions, rhb research head of research alexander chia believes that drivers for the market will be mainly external. the high-profile bond default by a certain government-owned investment company and malaysias reduced weighting on the msci axj has weighed on investor sentiment. domestically, we see downside support for the market, given that many funds remain underinvested, he says. maybank investment bank research regional head of research wong chew hann points out in a june 2 note that in the near term, there are two external and two domestic developments worth keeping an eye on. into june, we are mindful of two developments  the us federal open market committees meeting on june 14 and 15, and the brexit referendum on june 23  which will influence capital flows and sustain volatility in the global markets. domestically, we singled out two major things to look out for  the 2q2016 gdp, to be released on aug 12, and the ensuing monetary policy committee statement on sept 7 as well as the telco spectrum fee details, in mid-2016 or 3q2016, as there has been no clarity since january 2016, she says. details on the telco spectrum fees may induce relief, depending on the amount. and, a potential overnight policy rate cut may provide a relief to the broad-based consumer sector  negative for the banks and ringgit but positive for exports, she explains. last week, the us federal reserve decided to maintain its accommodative monetary policy, leaving the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 0.25% to 0.5%. while the median of the feds projections for 2016 still indicates two rate hikes this year, there appears to be a softening of the feds position, with six members now expecting one rate hike increase this year, up from just one three months ago. given the headwinds from the us interest rate hike, brexit and 1malaysia development bhd, coupled with uninspiring growth prospects, most brokers advocate a defensive equity strategy going forward while some advise a trading-oriented stance to accumulate quality stocks on market weakness. in terms of the stock selection strategy, alliancedbs research prefers exposure to stocks with low beta, strong earnings resilience and/or good dividend yields while maybank ib research believes that there are pockets of opportunities in thematic plays such as construction as well as plantation, which could continue to benefit from the el niu00f1o-induced crude palm oil rally. in the short term, the market reflects the consensus opinion, if there is a clear consensus. to determine the consensus sector allocation strategy recommended by the sell-side analysts, we compiled 10 strategy notes issued by foreign and local brokers. assigning a positive one score to an overweight recommendation and a negative one score to an underweight recommendation, table 3 shows the results of our tabulation. construction and electric utilities are the clear winners with a score of nine out of a full score of 10. banks, plantations and reits are also favoured with an equal score of three. it is noteworthy that there is no underweight recommendation on any of these sectors. the column on the far left of the table also shows brokers top picks that are viewed as top buys by at least two brokers. moving down to the second part of the list, we have the top five sectors that brokers think we ought to avoid. telecoms and auto are the top to-avoid sectors among the brokers, with a negative score of two and four respectively. however, brokers sentiment on property, healthcare and oil and gas are more mixed  property and oil and gas are trading at attractive valuations but both face uninspiring growth prospects. while healthcare stocks such as hospital operators are richly valued, they continue to enjoy stable growth, albeit at a low-teens rate. finally, we compiled the brokers top picks that were chosen by at least two brokers as top buys. table 4 shows the results of our tabulation, with the potential upside calculated by the difference between the last price and consensus target price, and valuations metrics such as price-earnings ratio, price-to-book ratio, dividend yield and return on equity. the list of top picks is rather construction-centric with six out of 24, or a quarter of them, being construction companies, followed by three banks and three plantation companies that together accounted for another 25% of the list. tnb and gamuda bhd are the clear big-cap favourites of the brokers with seven brokers picking them as their top picks. in the small to mid-cap space, airasia and kimlun corp bhd stand out after surprising analysts on the upside in their latest results. for investors seeking capital gains, skp resources bhd, muhibbah engineering (m) bhd, prestariang bhd, mitrajaya holdings bhd, ta ann holdings bhd and sapurakencana petroleum bhd provide significant upside potential of 20% to 44%, assuming the shares converge with their consensus target price. for investors seeking yields in a low-growth environment, uoa development bhd, malayan banking bhd, pavilion reit and sunway reit offer above-market-average dividend yields of 4.9% to 7.2%. attractive yields notwithstanding, it should be noted that earnings growth for banks and property developers are unlikely to be exciting as banks are now focusing on asset quality and have tightened their credit policy, which has, in turn, impacted developers sales. for reits, the continued delay in the us rate hike and a potential cut in domestic interest rate could be positive catalysts to rerate the asset class.

slightly weaker amid lacklustre trading ahead of a british referendum for a potential exit from the european union late yesterday. yesterday, latest brexit polls showed that the two sides were neck and neck, causing us markets to pull back from profit-taking activities. the dow jones industrial average fell 48.90 points to 17,780.83, while the s&p 500 index inched down 3.45 points to end at 2,085.45. the fbm klci traded in a narrower range of 17.61 points for the week with sluggish volumes of 1.1 billion to 1.35 billion shares traded. the index rose 2.29 points and closed at 1,639.98 yesterday from the previous day as blue-chip stocks such as cimb group holdings bhd, genting malaysia bhd, kuala lumpur kepong bhd, maxis bhd and tenaga nasional bhd caused the index to inch up on minor buying activities. the ringgit firmed against the us dollar at 4.0220 as brent crude inched up to us$48.60 (rm195.37) per barrel. the fbm klci rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,671.82 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,503.68 (low), 1,727.41 (high), 1,600.92 (low) and 1,729.13 (high). the index managed to surpass the key 62% fibonacci retracement (fr) level of 1,728.54 to a recent high of 1,729.13 on april 14, 2016. very heavy liquidation at that level had caused the index to decline to a new low of 1,613.79 on june 16, 2016. the indexs price bars are now between the 20-day and 50-day daily simple moving averages (smas) and this depicts a sideward phase for the fbm klci in the short to medium term. however, medium- to longer-term prospects look bleaker as the daily 50-day and 200-day smas have issued a dead cross this month, and the weekly 50-day and 200-day smas have also issued a dead cross in november 2015. any bargain hunting on the index will be met by heavy longer-term selling on rallies. the indexs daily signals are mixed, with all its directional movement index and oscillator indicators showing very obvious sell signals. the commodity channel index (cci), moving average convergence divergence (macd) and stochastic remain positive for now. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at the 1,567, 1,600 and 1,619 levels, while very heavy liquidation at the resistance areas of 1,639, 1,664 and 1,729 will cap the indexs rise. the daily downside targets for the index are located at 1,596, 1,569 and 1,527. all rebounds on the index to its 23%, 38%, 50% and 62% fr clusters of 1,666.69, 1,670.52, 1,679.62 and 1,684.35 would be met with very obvious longer-term selling and liquidation activities. due to the weak tone of the fbm klci, we are recommending a chart sell on malaysia building society bhd (mbsb). mbsb grants loans on the security of freehold and leasehold properties. a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that five research houses cover this stock, with four hold calls and one sell call. maybank investment bank bhd does not cover mbsb on a fundamental basis. mbsbs chart trend in the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is firmly down. from a daily wave c and recent all-time high of rm2.40 (october 2014), its share price has plunged 67.9% in the daily, weekly and monthly time frames to a weekly wave 3 low of 77.5 sen (june 2016). as prices broke above its recent key critical support levels of rm1.02 and rm1.19, look to sell mbsb on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term downtrend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, oscillator and stochastic) have issued very obvious sell signals, and now show firm and clear indications of mbsbs eventual plunge towards much lower levels. it would attract very weak buying activities at the support levels of 48 sen, 64 sen and 77.5 sen. we expect mbsb to witness very heavy activities at its resistance levels of 78.5 sen, rm1.02 and rm1.19. its clear downside targets are located at 23 sen, 48 sen, 57 sen and 76 sen. lee cheng hooi is the

"article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on june 24, 2016.  kuala lumpur: the slack performance of powerseraya pte ltd, the wholly-owned subsidiary of ytl power international bhd in singapore, has given rise to concern about the groups earnings prospects. maybank investment bank bhd analyst tan chi wei cut the groups net profit by about 2% for fy16 and slashed it further by 26% for fy17 and fy18, mainly to account for powerserayas lower earnings going forward. the groups net profit for the nine months ended march 31 (9mfy16) dropped 6.4% to rm665.9 million or 8.88 sen per share from rm711.7 million or 10.26 sen per share in the previous corresponding period. its revenue slid 11% to rm8.07 billion from rm9.07 billion a year ago. tan said powerserayas earnings have trended downward in recent years. this is mainly due to a power supply glut from the recent commissioning of new plants, with the reserve margin now about 90%. generators each have take-or-pay gas contracts, and thus are compelled to produce, resulting in continued erosion of tariffs that puts pressure on profitability. powerseraya made a mere s$2 million (rm6.01 million) of pre-tax profit in the third quarter ended march 31, 2016 (3qfy16), a far cry from the s$60 million to s$90 million quarterly run rate back in fy13 (ended june 30). we believe the 3qfy16 showing represents the new run rate going forward, a consequence of further tariff pressure, and have now reflected this in our forecasts, he said in a note on monday. unlike in malaysia, which has power purchase agreements (ppas), powerseraya instead needs to bid to sell power in the open market, thereby eliminating the guarantee of electricity capacity being taken up. according to ytl powers 2015 annual report, powerseraya sold 8,457 gigawatt hours (gwh) of electricity and captured a market share of 18%, compared with 20.5% in the previous financial year. the drop was largely due to strong competition arising from the commercial operations of new plants in singapores power generation market, ytl power said. nevertheless, tan estimates ytl power can still generate sufficient free cash flow (fcf) to sustain a 10 sen dividend per share (dps) that would provide downside support to the share price. meanwhile, an analyst who tracks the stock said the delay in the extended ppa for the 808mw paka power plant in terengganu with tenaga nasional bhd (tnb) and the groups loss-making wimax operation do not augur well. the pre-tax losses of the groups wimax operation, which is part of its mobile broadband network, narrowed to rm174.04 million in 9mfy16. revenue went up 1.38% to rm511.5 million in 9mfy16 from rm504.5 million a year ago. on the paka ppa, the analyst said unless ytl power resolves the outstanding issues with tnb, the contribution would not come in. however, he pointed out that prior to the expiry of the 21-year paka ppa with tnb, contribution from the plant and the ongoing operation in the pasir gudang power station amounted to about 10% of earnings. even when the short-term capacity deal kicks in, contribution would be positive but not significant, he said, referring to the short-term agreement on the paka plant that should have been signed for the period between march 1, 2016, and dec 31, 2018. ytl power derives a large bulk of its revenue from its subsidiary wessex water ltd in the united kingdom. the water and sewerage segment grew 12.4% to rm2.55 billion in 9mfy16 from rm2.27 billion last year. profit before taxation for the sector rose 7% with rm711 million in 9mfy16 compared with rm665.3 million a year ago."}, "177": {"date_posted": "21/6/2016", "title": "oil and gas player in the spotlight ", "article": " this article first appeared in corporate, the edge malaysia weekly, on june 6 - 12, 2016.  if its managing director amir hamzah azizan is to be believed, icon offshore bhds prospects are bright and the company is likely to play a key role in the consolidation of the offshore support vessel (osv) segment of the oil and gas (o&g) sector. he says icon will expand its operations regionally, become a market leader in the osv space and even possibly expand into new asset classes to support the o&g segment. definitely a regional play. it is never enough to look only at the home base, he says. while amir paints a pretty picture of the companys prospects, icon just announced its second consecutive quarterly loss late last month. it suffered a net loss of rm5 million on revenue of rm51.83 million for the quarter ended march. for the final quarter of fy2015, net losses were rm376.89 million on rm65.3 million in revenue.    as at end-march this year, icon had rm35.85 million in cash. its long-term debt amounted to rm501.47 million and short-term borrowings rm163.16 million. its accumulated losses stood at rm188.09 million.  a saving grace for icon could be its strong controlling shareholder. ekuiti nasional bhd, the state-controlled private equity (pe) firm, controls 42.57% of icons stock. other substantial shareholders include lembaga tabung haji with 8.43% equity interest.   on whether or not the o&g industry has bottomed out, amir says, well, i think there have been some good signs. when i joined the company in march, in the first quarter of the financial year, we saw the oil price at its lowest point of us$27 per barrel. by april, [oil was at] us$40 and now it is in the us$50s. the industry is reacting now, in the sense that, maybe the market has bottomed out a bit, he says. singing the same tune as amir, maybank investment banks t j liaw says in a report on icon late last month, we expect improved 2q16 earnings on higher asset utilisation. the osv market remains challenging but is in its trough. icon aims to be resilient in such times and targets to be ahead in m&a activity, when opportunity arises. its m&a prospect is a key standout, a rerating catalyst once it crystalises. he has a buy call based on valuations and m&a perspectives, ahead of a cyclical recovery. and he says his target price of 42 sen is based on one times enterprise value over replacement value. in early may, icon announced a rm42 million contract from exxonmobil exploration and production malaysia inc for the supply of two straight supply vessels for two years with an option for a year-long extension. liaw adds that with the two new contracts secured last month, icons utilisation rate of its vessels in the second quarter of the year will be above the break-even 50%, and more than the 45% it reached in the first quarter. maybank assumes an overall osv utilisation rate of 53% for this year and 65% for 2017, which would indicate that the worst is over for icon. while icon may bag new jobs and increase its utilisation rate, daily charter rates of osvs remain depressed, which could continue to weigh on its earnings. spot market and long-term charter rates have fallen considerably to us$1 to us$1.10 per bhp per day from us$1.20 a year ago.   nevertheless, maybank forecasts that icon will turn the corner and register a net profit of rm6.8 million for the current financial year, on the back of revenue of rm254.6 million. in fy2017 the bank-backed research outfit has icons net profit pegged at rm27.4 million from rm327.1 million in sales.     interestingly, liaw refers to icon as an m&a hotbed and cites amirs association with petroliam nasional bhd (where he had worked from 2000 until recently), the oil companys call for consolidation and ekuinas role as a pe investor, as among the factors for its positive outlook.  however, he says, size matters, after all, but it needs to be complemented with returns and profitability.  we will build a brand new industry amir hamzah azizan has been in the oil and gas (o&g) industry for 27 years. earlier this year, he left petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) to become managing director of icon offshore bhd, a company controlled by ekuiti nasional bhd (ekuinas). the move caught many by surprise. in a candid interview with the edge, amir explained the move and shares his views on the local o&g industry. here are excerpts.  the edge: why did you join icon? amir hamzah azizan: to be fair, i was very comfortable and enjoying myself in petronas, i was still in the midst of running the lubricant business. theres never a time when someone thinks that he has reached a point and say, im done, theres nothing left for me to do here, because theres always something to do. and here comes ekuinas, which says, would you now come and join us? the reality is that it (icon) has potential. it is going to face a lot of headwinds because we have seen the oil price move the way it has ... what better time for you to shape the industry?  you talk about consolidation. is there any mandate to consolidate the o&g industry, or is it your own direction for the company? when you talk about a mandate, what do we mean by that? does it mean the government tells me, i direct you to do it? theres no such thing. we will build a brand new industry for malaysia and thats an interesting proposition. not saying that its easy u2026 its difficult, but ive got quite a supportive shareholder.  you hope for icon to lead the consolidation. do you see any room for entrepreneurs to be involved in running the company?  i think its possible. i dont think organisations can run without some sense of entrepreneurship. the entrepreneurial spirit must be there.  would consolidation entail icon having the whole spectrum for offshore support vessel (osv) services? i think today, consolidation play is very useful because most of the players are quite subscale at this point. scale gives you the ability to have a wider range of vessels, more resources to introduce better systems and processes and all the good things that come with scale. but scale also creates challenges. you must be good in management u2026 a lot of moving parts.  will icon move from predominantly shallow water osvs? it is within our scope to look at, but in order for me to make the next leap, i have got to be sure i can integrate and hold the process well.  isnt the recent increase in oil price to us$50 a dampener for the consolidation? well, at us$50 oil, i dont think anybody is rolling in money. so the logic for consolidation is still there because at the end of the day, instinct tells you that you have to get bigger because you need to be able to support the majors in a different playing field. when you had the majors all operating at us$100 oil, you had the rich mans disease, right? when youre rich, you drop a dollar, you drop fifty cents, you dont pick it up u2026 you just walk away, its too much of a problem picking it up right? when you are a poor man, you will dig wherever you are, looking for pennies u2026 even in cracks. thats where we are. i think everybody whom we have broached the idea to would like to consider it ... but i wont say we are in detailed negotiations or anything of the like, but at least i have the alignment. no one has come back and told me its stupid (to consolidate).  so where does petronas come in? it can create an environment to help. im not saying petronas is going be asked to put in unreasonable catalysts. theres enough competition to keep everybody honest. but at least for the people who combine and do something  offer (them) a longer-term contract. that allows them to fund the business better and gives them stability.  what is your definition of scale? for the first phase, maybe call it the next two or three years, getting to a level of 50 to 80 ships. it will mean you have to have a base fleet here, but it will also offer you enough excess to play significantly in other regional markets that you want.

governments compensation would be timely as it had been in the past, the concession cash pile should grow considerably, offering an upside to dividends. this is highly possible as we estimate the concessions finance service cost ratio (fscr) to be at four times by end-fy17, while its debt covenant only prohibits dividend payout if its fscr falls below two times. litraks average dividend payout

watchmaker jaeger- lecoultre, qatar airways and mercedes-benz malaysia. i thank ocbc, jaeger-lecoultre and qatar airways for their continuous support of brc and welcome mercedes-benz back as our partner, ho adds. it is these partnerships that enable us to carry on with this prestigious corporate awards event. banking giant ocbc has been the main sponsor of brc since its inception in 2010. ocbc senior vice-president and head of corporate and commercial banking jeffrey teoh says ocbc is happy to support the edge media group in this event as it is something that is worthwhile and right to do. the recognition given to the winners of the various categories this year is a testament to their ability to achieve profitability in a tough global environment and commitment to corporate objectives and corporate conscience, he adds. the edge billion ringgit club has etched for itself a position as a holistic gold standard for the ranking of the top publicly-listed billion-ringgit companies in malaysia, built on the power of sustained relationships and their commitment to giving back to society. jaeger-lecoultres passion for corporate responsibility ties in perfectly with brcs objectives as well, which is why it is sponsoring the event for the second time. since 2008, it has worked tirelessly with united nations educational, scientific and cultural organization (unesco) to protect the 47 unesco world heritage marine sites. believing that ethics begins at home, the sourcing of all of jaeger-lecoultres diamonds, gold and leather are monitored carefully. besides that, it has stayed true to its origins by carefully controlling its expansion and meeting high standards in terms of construction, transport and energy, and water conservation. the ceo of the company of the year will receive a duomu00e8tre unique travel time watch, courtesy of jaeger-lecoultre. asserting itself as an absolute reference in terms of mechanical watchmaking, it is the first world-time watch that enables to-the-minute adjustment of the second time zone. this enables travellers to accurately set the second time zone for all continents and countries. the watch is divided into two distinct mechanisms: the first is devoted to displaying the local time and the second to showing the time in another time zone. each mechanism has a 50-hour power reserve and, to achieve ideal user-friendliness, the same crown serves to wind both barrels. coming back to sponsor the brc for the second time  the first was in 2010  is mercedes-benz malaysia, which relentlessly pursues its ambition to be the best or nothing. like companies in the brc, mercedes-benz malaysia seeks to uphold its innovative spirit and strives for perfection. this prestigious award, which recognises malaysian corporations par excellence, is certainly in line with our practices of pursuing a high-performance culture and excelling in our respective business fields, says mark raine, vice-president of sales and marketing at mercedes-benz malaysia. qatar airways is a second-time sponsor of the brc as well. country manager of malaysia & brunei datuk muzammil mohamad says the brc symbolises quality and growth borne from hard work, something that qatar airways identifies itself very closely with. in 2015, it won airline of the year at skytrax, something muzammil says inspired its staff to excel in the airline service industry. the recognition of elite companies creates an atmosphere of healthy competition that benefits consumers while sending a credible third-party signal to customers as to which are the businesses they can trust, he says. the brc recognises companies with a market capitalisation of rm1 billion and above as at march 31. companies are added to the annual list automatically once they fulfil the requirements and are evaluated based on growth in profit before tax, returns to shareholders and cr commitments, among others. the brc awards include the value creator: malaysias outstanding ceo, the edge brc most profitable company, the edge brc highest profit growth company, the edge brc best performing stock, the edge brc best cr initiatives and the coveted company of the year award. previous winners of the value creator: malaysias outstanding ceo award were public bank group chairman tan sri teh hong piow, cimb group chairman datuk seri nazir razak, ammb holdings bhd chairman tan sri azman hashim, airasia group ceo tan sri tony fernandes, former malayan banking bhd president and ceo datuk seri abdul wahid omar and former s p setia bhd president and ceo tan sri liew kee sin. from this year, real estate investment trusts, which were previously grouped in a combined sector with property companies, will be recognised as a sector in its own right. in addition, companies with a market cap of more than rm10 billion have been separated into two separate categories: super big cap companies with a market cap of more than rm40 million, and big cap companies with a market cap of between rm10 billion and rm40 billion."}, "180": {"date_posted": "17/6/2016", "title": "prevalent index weakness", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on june 17, 2016.  us equity markets ended slightly weaker despite a steady interest rate policy that emerged from the federal reserves june federal open market committee (fomc) meeting that ended on wednesday. market expectations for an interest rate hike dwindled ahead of the fomc meeting amid a lacklustre may job report and concerns about a british exit from the european union. the dow jones industrial average fell 34.65 points to 17,640.17, while the s&p 500 index inched down 3.82 points to end at 2,071.5. the fbm klci plunged despite a narrower range of 20.8 points traded for the week with sluggish volumes of 1.46 billion to 1.56 billion dealt. the index fell 13.06 points and closed at 1,614.90 yesterday from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like british american tobacco (m) bhd, cimb group holdings bhd, genting bhd, misc bhd and petronas chemicals bhd caused the index to fall on major selling activities. the ringgit was slightly weaker against the us dollar at 4.1000 as brent crude declined to us$46.75 (rm191.68) per barrel. the fbm klci rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,671.82 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,503.68 (low), 1,727.41 (high), 1,600.92 (low) and 1,729.13 (high). the index managed to surpass the key 62% fibonacci retracement (fr) level of 1,728.54 to a recent high of 1,729.13 on april 14, 2016. very heavy liquidation at that level had caused the index to decline and move into a downward phase for its 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages (sma) with a dead cross on its short-term daily chart. the indexs price bars are now below the 50-day and 200-day daily sma and this depicts a downward phase for the fbm klci in the medium to longer term. medium- to longer-term prospects look bleaker as the weekly 50-day and 200-day sma have also issued a dead cross in june 2016. any bargain hunting on the index will be met by heavy longer-term selling on rallies. the indexs daily signals are weaker, with all its commodity channel index (cci), directional movement index (dmi), oscillator and stochastic depicting very obvious sell signals. the moving average convergence divergence (macd) remains positive for now. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at 1,567, 1,595 and 1,600, while very heavy liquidation at the resistance areas of 1,614, 1,664 and 1,729 will cap the indexs rise. the daily downside targets for the index are located at 1,596, 1,569 and 1,527. all rebounds on the index to its 23%, 38%, 50% and 62% fr clusters of 1,666.69, 1,670.52, 1,679.62 and 1,684.35 would be met with very obvious longer-term selling and liquidation activities. due to the very weak tone for the fbm klci, we are recommending a chart sell on uem edgenta bhd. uem edgenta is a diversified company that has interests in asset development and asset management consultancy, infrastructure maintenance, integrated facilities management, and also develops and manages properties.  a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that three research houses cover this stock, with two hold and a buy calls. maybank-ib does not cover uem edgenta on a fundamental basis. its chart trend on the daily and weekly time frames is firmly down. from a daily wave c and recent high of rm3.98 (may 2016), its prices have plunged 19.1% on the daily and weekly time frames to a daily wave 3 low of rm3.22 (june 2016). as prices broke above their recent key critical support levels of rm3.56 and rm3.61, look to sell uem edgenta on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to medium- term downtrends for this stock. the daily indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) have issued clear sell signals and now show firm and obvious indications of uem edgentas eventual plunge towards much lower levels. it would attract very weak buying activities at the support levels of rm2.96, rm3.16 and rm3.22. we expect uem edgenta to witness very heavy activities at its resistance levels of rm3.27, rm3.56 and rm3.61. its clear downside targets are located at rm2.87, rm2.26 and rm2.13. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the

2016 (3qfy16) results could be sequentially weaker, it could still be within our and the markets expectations. nevertheless, we cut our financial year ending aug 31, 2017 (fy17) to fy18 earnings per share (eps) forecasts by 11% per annum on a lower us dollar/ringgit assumption of 4.00. we also lower 2017 price-earnings ratio (per) target to its mean of 15 times (from 19 times) given its normalising earnings outlook. consequently, our new tp is rm4.60 (from rm6.50) and the stock is now a hold (previously buy). its 3qfy16 results are scheduled for release today. we estimate its net profit to be sequentially weaker at rm65 million to rm75 million (-28% to -38% quarter-on-quarter [q-o-q]; -10% to +4% year-on-year [y-o-y]) as benefits of a stronger sales volume (about +5% q-o-q,

more intense nitrile glove average selling prices (asps). we expect its operating margin to contract around four percentage points q-o-q (flattish y-o-y). we think its earnings could improve in 4qfy16, considering that latex prices will soften seasonally from this month, offsetting the higher minimum wage and potential gas tariff hikes, both in july. also, nitrile competition has eased this month, on slower capacity growth, and glove makers have pushed through higher nitrile glove asps. meanwhile, the 4qfy16 us dollar/ringgit rate will continue to hover at the 3qfy16 level. we maintain our fy16 earnings forecasts, but lower our fy17 to fy18 eps by 11% per annum as we lower our us dollar/ringgit assumptions to an average of 4.00 (from 4.10). on normalising external tailwinds (stable us dollar/ringgit rate and still low latex prices), we now project top gloves net profit to contract 8% y-o-y in fy17. as earnings normalise, we lower our target 2017 per to its mean of 15 times (from

not slowing down, charts future growth in rapid project", "article": "  this article first appeared in corporate, the edge malaysia weekly, on may 16 - 22, 2016. petronas chemicals group bhd (petchem), which had a weak start to the year as first-quarter net profit slipped 2% from a year earlier, has no plans to slow down anytime soon. after putting its house in order over the last two years, the group is all set to ramp up capacity and feedstock supply reliability in order to increase its share of the market and fend off incoming competition, especially from the middle east. besides the sabah ammonia and urea (samur) plant in sipitang, sabah, which will provide an additional 1.2 million tonnes per year of granulated urea once commissioned by year-end, petchem is spending us$2.7 billion (rm10.8 billion) to build four petrochemical plants in pengerang, johor. it currently produces 1.4 million tonnes of granulated urea a year. so far, the group has awarded four contracts worth a combined us$1.36 billion to two consortia to build the four polyethylene and glycol processing plants in the us$27 billion refinery and petrochemical integrated development (rapid) project. but, considering the adverse conditions in the oil and gas (o&g) market, is it a good time to make such huge investment now? petchem managing director and ceo datuk sazali hamzah tells the edge in an interview last monday that the groups investment in rapid is not just another capacity expansion decision by the group. the project will not only make petchem the largest producer of polyethylene and glycol in the region, but will also pave the way for a future without natural gas  a commodity that is in critical shortage in the country. why is rapid a good project for us? first, our gas capacity is already at its peak. gas supply [from petronas] can only be sustained at our current capacity for the next 20 years. to grow our gas-based petrochemical productions, the supply would not be enough, sazali says. we can grow a little bit here and there, but not in a big way. thus, we have to start using naphtha [as feedstock]. naphtha is usually a by-product of oil refining. it can also be refined from coal, tar and shale oil. and now is the best time for us to compete in the naphtha area as we still have the advantage of having big margins in our gas-based business. according to sazali, about 30% of petrochemical players in the world are gas-based producers, with petchem being one of the largest. it is worth noting that gas-based players, especially those subsidised by governments or quasi-government entities such as petroliam nasional bhd (petronas), enjoy better margins than naphtha-based producers. while malaysia is blessed with abundant natural gas reserves, most of the proven reserves have been pledged to north asian countries on long-term contracts. petronas has even ventured into british columbia in canada to secure gas supply for future requirements. despite the depleting gas reserves, petronas is still committed to supporting petchems growth as a gas-based petrochemical producer. sazali says the group recently finalised a new gas supply agreement with its parent company, petronas, before the current 20-year contract expires this september. apart from the ability to start a naphtha-based petrochemical plant, the investment in four plants in rapid will increase petchems capacity by half once they are up and running by late 2019 or early 2020, says sazali. with the projects in rapid, naphtha-based petrochemicals will constitute 30% of our production capacity. we would be much more robust than those players that are 100% naphtha-based producers, while on the gas-based side, nobody can be as big as us in this region, says sazali. the o&g industry has been facing one of the worst downward cycles in history over the last 2u00bd years, with crude oil prices plunging from above us$110 per barrel in june 2014 to us$28 per barrel in january this year. last friday, international brent crude futures were trading at us$47.66 per barrel. while acknowledging that nobody can tell what the demand for petroleum and petrochemical products is going to be like over the next five years, sazali says that, based on his past experience, there should be at least two upward cycles in the o&g industry over a 20-year period. for a petrochemical project, one upward cycle is enough to recover the initial capital outlay, says sazali, speaking from his experience during the construction of the kerteh integrated petrochemical complex (kipc) in terengganu in the early 1990s. it was the same scenario during that time. i was involved in the development of the aromatics complex in kipc. people were asking why we were spending rm2 billion  a huge amount at that time  on these two plants. when we first ran the aromatics operation, the price was at the lowest margin. we built big plants with low margins but two years after that, the market picked up quickly. so, if we had not followed our discipline along the way back then, we would not be able to enjoy the benefits now, says sazali. he adds that demand for petrochemical products is growing, especially in a region where 50% of the population is forecast to reach middle income level by 2030. today, southeast asia has a population of 620 million. to fulfil the growing demand for petroleum and petrochemical products, sazali estimates that there is a need for eight integrated refinery and petrochemical complexes the size of rapid in the region. to illustrate the high demand for petrochemical products in this region, sazali says up to 70% of samurs capacity has been committed to customers so far, although demand for the products could take up the entire annual capacity of the plant. petchems balance sheet is still healthy, with cash and cash equivalents of rm8.57 billion and only rm15 million in borrowings as at march 31 this year. the group generated rm891 million in cash from operations in the first quarter ended march 31 (1qfy2016). while the investments in rapid will require petchem to utilise its cash hoard and take up borrowings, sazali assures that the groups dividend payout policy of 50% of earnings will not be affected. in 1qfy2016, petchem posted a lower net profit of rm592 million compared with rm605 million a year ago, while revenue slipped 0.2% to rm3.15 billion from rm3.14 billion previously. however, during the quarter, petchems plant utilisation across the group reached its highest level since listing, at 92%, compared with 90% in 1qfy2015. its olefins and derivatives business recorded plant utilisation of 97% during the period, while fertilisers and methanol was 89%. petchems share price has been on a steady increase over the last one year, adding 7.7% over the period to rm6.45 last thursday. between aug 24, 2015, and jan 8, 2016, petchems share price rose 40.3% to rm7.74. last friday, the counter closed at rm6.20, 16.7% off its 52-week peak. analysts are quite bullish about the groups prospects. maybank investment bank research has a target price of rm7.80 on petchem over the next 12 months with a buy call, while kenanga research has placed a fair value of rm7.30 per share on the stock.

globetronics technology bhds recent disappointing quarterly earnings have had investors asking whether it will be the new norm for the electronic component manufacturer down the road. the plunge in net profit in the first quarter and a caution from the company that second-quarter earnings will continue to be weak suggest that its outlook is bleak, at least for the near term. orders received and projections so far show that the demand for our major smart products will remain flat in the near term, says globetronics ceo datuk heng huck lee in an email reply to the edge. last year, sensors for smartphones made up 45% of globetronics portfolio. last week, the worlds largest technology company, apple inc, reported its worst quarterly results over a decade, as revenue and net profit plunged due to a decline in iphone sales. iphone sales make up two-thirds of apples revenue. analysts have long expected the technology company to record poorer sales and net profit this quarter, but the magnitude of the decline took many by surprise. many say the smartphone boom has ended, implying that electronic component manufacturers like globetronics are unlikely to see stellar growth numbers going forward. however, heng opines that the smartphone market is still very sizeable, with over 1.3 billion units sold annually. i think it will continue to grow in terms of user base and total volume sold annually. but it may not be the double-digit era anymore. the main challenge for the makers and suppliers will be whether there will be corresponding growth in revenue and profit for them, he says. he adds that these days, smartphones, be they the premium or the mid or the lower cost models, have similar features and capabilities, making product differentiation rather difficult. pricing, he says, has become the main volume driver, which indicates that margins will be squeezed along the entire supply chain. all this while, globetronics has been focusing on new features and functions for the mid-cost and premium models. we are optimistic that there will still be a sizeable market for these models. this market may slow down before it picks up again as more new exciting functions and features are added to the smartphones, says heng. he also says the semiconductor and electronics sector will see flat to very low single-digit growth this year. but he believes that there will be more exciting growth rates in the following year as the sector looks to new opportunities in the internet of things. cyclical [swings] are normal for the semiconductor and electronics industry, but there has been continuous growth driven by new innovations, says heng. globetronics share price took a heavy beating recently, plunging from rm5.37 on april 21 to rm3.42 at the close of last friday. the slide came ahead of its first quarter ended march 31, 2016 (1qfy2016), financial results announcement on april 26. heng expresses surprise at investors reaction to the results. if you were to look at globetronics track record, it has been profitable every year since its initial public offering in 1997. we have a very healthy balance sheet and cash flow. the management has always strived to be cost competitive to win business and deliver good returns. we have also maintained generous dividend payouts every year since 1997, he says. last year, the company paid a dividend of 23 sen per share, which works out to a payout ratio of 91%. until recently, globetronics had been a star performer and an investor favourite. over five years, the counter has risen from 80 sen a share in april 2011 to a high of rm6.60 last december. globetronics manufactures sensors, timing devices, led and semiconductors. its share price had started to rise as it shifted away from traditional semiconductor manufacturing to the manufacture of smartphone sensors. as the heavy selling pressure over the last two weeks would suggest, the first-quarter results were a disappointment to the market. net profit shrank to rm3.68 million from rm17.15 million a year ago, while revenue dipped to rm58.74 million from rm88.7 million previously. the decline in earnings was because of lower volume loadings from some of its customers due to weaker demand. the company also suffered foreign exchange losses of rm4.6 million in the quarter. our first-quarter revenue was in line with our guidance over the past several months. as for the earnings, due to foreign exchange uncertainties, we did not provide any specific guidance, but we did caution about a drop. our revenue is dependent on our major smartphone customers performance. we did anticipate our top and bottom lines to change in tandem with our customers projections, explains heng. even so, four out of five analysts covering the stock have downgraded it from buy to hold after the results announcement. target prices from these research houses were also slashed to between rm3.70 and rm4 from between rm7.10 and rm6.66 previously. on the back of weaker smartphone shipments y-o-y in 1h2016 and the deferment of the mass production of 3d-imaging sensors to 2017, we now expect globetronics sensor volume to contract 39% y-o-y this year. along with minor volume cuts in its quart crystal and timing device, led and small outline integrated circuit divisions, we expect fy2016 revenue to contract 18% y-o-y, says maybank investment bank research in a report. the research house adds that it expects growth to resume in fy2017 with the mass adoption of the 3d-imaging sensor, but it will be offset by a lower us

article first appeared in corporate, the edge malaysia weekly, on april 25 - may 1, 2016. convenience store operations are big business in japan. most are successful simply because they find ways to fulfil customer needs. they are well-stocked with fresh food and, more importantly, they are clean, staffed with helpful personnel and offer competitively priced products. it is no surprise, then, that when local poultry giant ql resources bhd revealed its plan to bring the familymart franchise to malaysia, netizens flooded social media to express their support and excitement about the entrance of the popular japanese convenience store chain. 7-eleven malaysia holdings bhd, the countrys largest convenience store chain operator, is now facing stiffer competition and its ceo and executive director gary thomas brown concedes that there is still much to learn from japanese convenience stores. we look a lot at japan because we think it is the best convenience store market in the world. i was there last month and we spent a lot of time studying their market. frankly, we try to copy things that look applicable to malaysia. shamelessly, we must admit, because they are really good at it, brown tells the edge in an interview last week. 7-eleven malaysia, a 53.4%-owned subsidiary of berjaya retail bhd, which is controlled by tycoon tan sri vincent tan, has been an icon of 24-hour convenience stores in malaysia for over 30 years. as at dec 31 last year, 7-eleven malaysia operated 1,944 stores and commanded about 80% of the stand-alone convenience store sector. brown says 7-eleven malaysia is learning from the japanese convenience stores the concept of true convenience, such as providing fresh food and beverages, as well as bill payment services at its stores. we see this as a big trend. we now offer coffee in about 1,000 stores. that is a very big push for us. you can come to have a cup of coffee, buy nasi lemak, pay your water bill ... and sit down to do all that, he adds.  we also provide seating at 95% of our new stores. you can do multiple purchases and tasks in nice surroundings. parcel lockers will also be available at 7-eleven stores nationwide soon, says brown. through its partnership with parcel locker operator boxit holdings sdn bhd, 500 parcel locker machines will be installed in certain stores within the next two years. that is a service, but it also brings potential customers to our stores. we want to convert these people into our customers so they visit more often and spend more, he says. brown, a 57-year-old australian, joined 7-eleven malaysia as deputy ceo in december 2013 before he was promoted to his current post in august 2014. earlier this month, ql resources announced that it plans to invest rm80 million to rm100 million in its venture with familymart, the second largest convenience store network in the world. the group intends to open as many as 300 outlets here within five years, with the first to be operational by end-2016. on average, ql resources will open 60 familymart stores per year. however, brown believes there is no reason for 7-eleven malaysia to pull back its aggressive plan to open 200 stores per year for at least the next 10 years. the expansion of new stores and the refurbishment of old stores is expected to cost rm85 million to rm90 million a year. there is nothing in the announcement [from ql resources] that would make us rethink our strategy. in fact, it only reinforces or reaffirms that our strategy and expansion plan are correct. he says it is too early to say whether familymart will become a big threat to 7-eleven malaysia. we certainly respect them as a potential competitor because 300 stores in five years will give them some scale. but if you look at the dynamics of it, five years later, we [7-eleven malaysia] are going to have 3,000 stores, out of which 1,000 are new stores, while they will have 300 stores. thats a big difference, he says, adding that 7-eleven malaysia is determined to maintain its pole position. brown also warns that it is not easy for a newcomer to enter the convenience retailing market and make an impact, even for the likes of circle k, one of north americas most popular operators. circle k is another prominent brand of convenience stores, and one that we respect. three years ago, they announced that they would have 500 stores in five years. as of today, they have fewer than 10 stores, he says. it is worth noting that airline caterer brahims holdings bhd has signed a memorandum of understanding with 7-eleven malaysia on april 15 to supply food to the latters stores. brahims will develop menu specifications and products to be marketed through 7-eleven malaysias nationwide chain of convenience stores, while the latter will provide a centralised distribution centre to deliver all products manufactured by the former.  brown says he is excited about the collaboration with brahims, as its ready-to-eat meals and ready-to-heat foods are halal, which will appeal to 7-eleven malaysias customer base. the opportunity to work with brahims is fantastic. it has a large kitchen facility and it can supply to any number of our stores, so thats a perfect situation for us, he says. on 7-eleven malaysias financial results, brown expects the financial year ending dec 31, 2016 (fy2016), to be better than fy2015. certainly, we can expect growth in revenue and profit this year. i also expect fy2017 to be a better year as consumer sentiment and spending are set to rebound, he says. in fy2015, 7-eleven saw its net profit decline 11.5% to rm55.8 million, compared with rm63.1 million the previous year. the weaker earnings performance was attributed to higher selling and distribution expenses from new store expansion. the groups revenue, however, rose 6% to rm2 billion from rm1.89 billion in fy2014, driven by growth in new stores, improved merchandise mix and consumer promotion activities. brown says the implementation of the goods and services tax (gst) in april last year, as well as a significant decline in consumer confidence and spending to a 10-year low in the third quarter, had dampened the groups overall financial performance in fy2015. when the gst came along, the sales tax was abolished. as we cannot capture gst in our sales, our revenue automatically declined by 6%. in other words, when i sold the same product, i lost 6% post-gst for doing nothing differently, and it was very hard to cover that, he says. year to date, shares of 7-eleven malaysia have fallen 8.2% to rm1.39, giving it a market capitalisation of rm1.63 billion. rhb research, cimb research and maybank ib have hold calls on 7-eleven malaysia, while ubs has a sell. according to bloomberg, the stock has a consensus target price of rm1.43, representing an upside of only 2.9%."}, "188": {"date_posted": "6/5/2016", "title": "persistent downward volatility", "article": " this article first appeared in the

previous day, as blue-chip stocks like genting malaysia bhd, ioi corp bhd, petronas dagangan bhd, ppb group bhd and public bank bhd caused the index to decline on heavy liquidation activities. the ringgit was much weaker against the us dollar at 4.0080, despite brent crude rising to us$45.09 (rm180.36) per barrel. the fbm klci rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014), and this represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 comprised key swings of

of 1,729.13 on april 14, 2016. very heavy liquidation at that level had caused the index to decline and move in a downward phase for its 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages (smas) on its short-term daily chart. the indexs price bars are now below the 50-day and 200-day smas, and this depicts a downward phase for the fbm klci in the medium to longer term. the indexs daily signals are mainly negative, with its commodity channel index (cci), directional movement index (dmi), moving average convergence divergence (macd) and oscillator indicators all depicting very obvious sell signals. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at 1,567, 1,600 and 1,636, while very heavy liquidation at resistance areas of 1,645, 1,700 and 1,729 will cap the indexs rise. should any rebounds appear, the key fibonacci retracement levels to sell on the fbm klci are 1,659.23, 1,668.68, 1,671.61, 1,678.76, 1,682.59, 1,688.83 and 1,693.57. due to the very weak tone of the fbm klci, we are recommending a chart sell on globetronics technology bhd. the company manufactures and assembles integrated circuits, optoelectronics products, technical ceramic substrates, electrostatic-sensitive device protective materials, small outline components, technical plating services and packaging materials. a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that five research houses cover this stock, with five hold calls. maybank investment bank bhds analyst recently downgraded globetronics from buy to a hold call and lowered its target price from rm6.90 to rm3.90. globetronics first quarter of financial year 2016 (1qfy16) net profit of rm4 million was disappointing as its operating margin collapsed on weaker revenue, exacerbated by foreign-exchange translation losses. quarter-on-quarter, 1qfy16 revenue fell 24% on weaker demand across the board for all products.  globetronics chart trend in the daily, weekly and and monthly time frames is firmly down. from a weekly wave 5 and all-time high of rm6.80 (january 2016), its share price has plunged 45.9% in the daily and weekly time frames to a weekly wave 3 low of rm3.12 (may 2016). as its share price broke above its recent key critical support levels of rm4.38 and rm5.05, look to sell globetronics on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term downtrend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi and macd) have issued clear sell signals, and now show firm and obvious indications of globetronics eventual plunge towards much lower levels. it would attract very weak buying activities at the support levels of rm2.81, rm3.12 and rm3.33. we expect globetronics to witness very heavy activities at its resistance levels of rm3.44, rm4.38 and rm5.05. its clear downside targets are located at rm2.69, rm1.90 and 70 sen. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed in the article are the

11 - 17, 2016. with a market capitalisation of rm85 million, opensys (m) bhd is a micro-cap company with a still small but rapidly growing revenue base that is off the radar screen of most institutional investors. the msc-status company specialises in providing cash and non-cash payment processing solutions, including the distribution and rental of bill payment kiosks, cash recycling machines (crm) and cheque deposit machines (cdm) as well as cheque processing services.  opensys was founded in 1995 by two former employees of the us-listed ncr corp. drawing on the duos past relationship with ncr, opensys started out with a three-year contract from the american company to serve its customers in malaysia. following its successful development of non-cash efficient service machines (esm) for bank branches in 2001, opensys rapidly expanded its client base in the industry in the following years and was listed on the ace market in 2004. since then, its net profit has been on a tear (see chart 1) while revenue more than tripled from rm20.3 million to rm72.5 million over 12 years. the better economies of scale, coupled with improving margins, also helped propel its return on equity (roe) by an impressive 16 percentage points to 18.4%. today, the company counts among its clients all major banks in the country, such as maybank, public bank, hong leong bank and united overseas bank, and insurance and telecommunications companies. despite the challenging operating environment in the banking sector, opensys delivered double-digit earnings growth in 2015. in its financial year ended dec 31, 2015 (fy2015), revenue surged 60.8% year on year to a new high of rm72.5 million while net profit rose by a lower but still respectable rate of 38.6% y-o-y to rm7.8 million. the company attributed the improved performance to the rollout of the crm, esm and cheque processing services. much of the revenue growth in fy2015 was driven by its hardware segment  the purchasing, manufacturing and distributing of esm machines. the company also said its net profit would have been higher if not for the higher cost of sales incurred from the weakening of the ringgit last year. indeed, gross margin declined to 29.8% in 2015 from 37.7% in 2014 as higher import costs ate into its atm distribution margin.  banking on dual-function machines  weaker margins notwithstanding, the hardware segment has now overtaken the software and services business as the larger revenue contributor, bringing in 53% of total sales in fy2015. this was mostly due to the continued market acceptance of its crm and it is not hard to see why this trend is catching on in the banking industry. combining cash-dispensing and cash deposit atms into dual-function machines, crm help banks to save up to 25% to 30% in capital expenditure and operating cost in cash maintenance, cash handling and space rental. besides higher cost efficiency, crm also have lower downtimes compared with the traditional single-function atms due to the automatic recycling of cash in the machines. at the companys extraordinary general meeting last october, co-founder-cum-ceo tan kee chung  also opensys largest shareholder with 21.2% equity interest  said he was optimistic of growth prospects as there was a huge opportunity to expand its market share. he added that there were about 17,000 atms in malaysia with an annual growth rate of about 5% while the penetration rate of crm stood at a mere 4% of the installed base. just based on replacement alone, that is already a huge market, he concluded. in line with the cash recycling trend worldwide, opensys partnered japans oki electric in 2013 to supply and provide maintenance services for crms in malaysia. in 2014, it secured orders for several hundred crm from two major banks in malaysia worth over rm20 million. opensys says in its latest annual report that the other banks in malaysia have taken notice of the successful deployment of crm in the two banks. to maintain their competitiveness, opensys noted that several banks had since expedited their crm strategy by commissioning customer trials with opensys/oki last year. with regard to claims that bank negara malaysias various initiatives and long-term trend to migrate to a cashless society will render its business model unsustainable, opensys countered that cash was still the preferred payment mode and that the number of currency notes in circulation will continue to grow. according to bank negaras financial stability and payment systems report 2015, atm transaction volume still grew at a cagr of 6.7% in the past five years, albeit much lower than a cagr of 22.9% for transaction volume carried via internet banking.  while we still see an increase in the use of atms, a more worrying trend is the ongoing decline in the use of cheques, which could impact opensys other business segment, that is software solutions and services (sss). bank negara data shows that the number of cheques issued declined 16.5% in 2015 compared with a fall of 10.1% in 2014 and 3.3% in 2013 (see chart 3). moving forward, the central bank targets to reduce the number of cheques issued per year from the current 148 million to 100 million by 2020. accounting for 71.8% of gross profit in 2015, opensys sss segment includes the provision of bill payment and cheque processing solutions. for the former, opensys manages the whole infrastructure (both hardware and software) of bill payment kiosks on behalf of utility, insurance and telecoms companies in malaysia. in return, opensys charges a fee for each payment transaction performed, resulting in steady recurring income for the company. for cheque processing solutions, opensys is the market leader in cheque-deposit machines and image-based cheque processing systems in malaysia, commanding a hefty 85% of the market in local self-service machines. commenting on the structural decline in cheque usage, the company said it would also gain if banks started to outsource the processing of cheques to third parties. opensys already has a track record in providing cheque-clearing services to the countrys largest bank in malaysia. despite the high growth in earnings, shares of this low-profile company have been range-bound, trading between 24 sen and 32 sen over the past year. as a result, its trailing 12-month pe compressed from 19.7 times in 2014 to 15.6 times in 2015 and further to 10.8 times. its valuation appears comparatively cheap compared with its ace market-listed peers, such as rexit bhd (13.3 times), microlink solutions bhd (17.1 times), excel force msc bhd (27.9 times) and ghl systems bhd (60.3 times). opensys has consistently paid a dividend of one sen per share in the past five years, translating into a decent yield of 3.1%. thanks to net profit growth, the dividend payout ratio had also dropped from 89.7% in 2010 to 33.6% in 2015. coupled with its low capex requirements, this gives management plenty of room to increase dividends in the future. with a net profit of rm7.8 million in 2015 and an aggregate net profit of rm25.7 million in the past five years, opensys has met the profit track record required to transfer its listing to the main market of bursa malaysia. even though the company proposed and completed a one-for-three bonus issue last year to increase its share liquidity and to reward its shareholders, the stock has yet to garner investor interest, judging by its share price performance thus far. the counter closed at 28.5 sen last

rising to us$42.60 per barrel. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014), and this represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,671.82 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,503.68 (low), 1,727.41 (high) and 1,600.92 (low). the

profit-taking at resistance areas of 1,729, 1,744 and 1,752 may cap the indexs rise. due to the firmer tone of the fbm klci, we are recommending a chart buy on csc steel holdings bhd. csc steel manufactures and markets steel products like steel pipes, cold rolled coils, steel sheets and galvanised steel products. a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that no research house covers this

of 5.72 sen (fy14). csc steels current price-earnings ratio and price-to-book value are very decent at low levels of 9.9 times and 0.69 times respectively. its return on equity stood at 7.3% and its indicative dividend yield is at a very attractive 5.59%. elsewhere, there was no other significant news on the stock recently.  csc steels chart trend in the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is firmly up. from a daily wave-2 low of 92 sen (oct 6, 2015), its share price has turned up strongly in the daily, weekly and monthly time frames to a recent april 2016 high of rm1.45. as the share

edge malaysia weekly, on march 28 - april 3, 2016.  in under two weeks, felda global ventures holdings bhds (fgv) deadline to satisfy the conditions precedent for its rm976.3 million acquisition of a 55% stake in china-based zhong ling nutri-oil holdings ltd will end. the ministry of finance has given its blessing for the deal to proceed, but fgv still has to convince bank negara malaysia and its own shareholders by april 8. according to fgvs announcement to bursa malaysia, the central bank has not replied to its application for the acquisition, which was submitted in april last year. shareholders, too, have yet to receive any circulars seeking consent to the acquisition. nevertheless, it is worth noting that the april 8 deadline is a soft one and may be mutually extended by the parties to the proposed acquisition. prior to this, it had been extended from march 4 to march 18. so far, the finer details of the zhong ling acquisition are sketchy and shareholders are unlikely to overlook the gaps in what has been announced. zhong ling is a cayman island- incorporated company with subsidiaries in the refining and production of peanut and other vegetable oils. it has 135,000 tonnes of refining capacity in nantong city in jiangsu province and a 45 million packing capacity. it can boast a customer network of 60,000 retail outlets in five chinese provinces. fgv premised its acquisition of zhong ling on three factors. first, the company impressed with its established operations and proven profit track record. second, fgv intends to boost its downstream capabilities in line with its global strategic blueprint. third, fgv is looking to use zhong ling to penetrate the chinese market. this reasoning, though, may be problematic. based on zhong lings audited accounts, the company generated rm144 million in profit on the back of revenue of rm1.2 billion in fy2013. this translates into a price-earnings ratio (per) of 12.3 times and price-to-book value of three times. there are no audited accounts for fy2014 and fy2015, but zhong ling is expected to rake in a net profit of rm199 million and rm201 million respectively, translating into a per of 10 times for fy2014 and nine times for fy2015. analysts polled by the edge say the acquisition is attractive in terms of its valuations, but they caution shareholders not to jump to conclusions without the benefit of salient details of zhong lings financials, operating statistics, assets and governance issues. the question is, if you can buy a profitable company at such low valuations, why isnt someone else in on it? with the available numbers, what we can infer is that zhong ling has impressive double-digit margins, compared with the industrys single digit. what we dont know is where the earnings are coming from, whether there were one-off items that bumped them up and whether or not they are sustainable. on the face of it, it can be earnings accretive, but you cant say if it is a good or a bad deal at this point, says an analyst. others question whether the structure of the deal enhances shareholder value. under the sales and purchase agreement, fgv will be entitled to more zhong ling shares if zhong ling underperforms in fy2014 and fy2015. the management of zhong ling is slated to issue shares to make up the shortfall. why would fgv want to have more shares of an underperforming company? wouldnt it better if it is compensated with cash instead? the analyst asks. fgv calls the purchase of the zhong ling stake a strategic move because it will protect the companys margins by establishing a strong downstream presence in china. however, the extent to which fgv can derive synergistic benefits from the acquisition is questionable. another analyst from a bank-backed research house questions the rationale and asks, why not buy a palm oil refiner instead? cimb research, which is negative on the acquisition, points out in a feb 26 note that there are a lack of synergies from the assets to be acquired with fgvs existing business because the feedstock required by zhong lings subsidiaries includes peanut oil, not purely palm oil.  even if the deal is mutually beneficial to the negotiating parties, maybank ib research highlights in its feb 29 report that integration and synergy will take time. many are also suspicious of fgvs decision to buy the zhong ling stake, given its track record of overseas downstream ventures. fgv just sold its oilseed processing plant in canada for rm567.1 million in november last year, after three loss-making years. further, while there is appeal in the size and potential of the chinese market, it will not be easy for fgv to grow its presence through zhong ling. market observers say the chinese market is a volume game, with the biggest market share holders controlling the edible oil scene. wilmar international ltd, chinas leading cooking oil producer, had 34% share of the market in 2013. in contrast, zhong lings notable brands, which include tuoniao, youerlang and chuayi, are relatively trivial, at 0.9%. while fgv can muscle in and build these brands to eventually command a bigger share of the market, a slowing chinese economy and more subdued domestic demand can hinder that progress. i believe buying zhong ling can be a good deal if fgv wants to enter a new market. but, everything boils down to future earnings and, at the moment, the buying interest in china is not that strong. so, we will have to see how this goes, says chong hoe leong, an analyst with publicinvest research. investors are likely to get more clarity on the questions surrounding the acquisition when fgv finally calls for a shareholders meeting. in the meantime, the red flags are waving. fgvs stock, meanwhile, has been lacklustre since the announcement of the proposed zhong ling acquisition. fgv ended trading at rm1.48 last friday, 5.7% down from the time the proposed acquisition was first announced last month.

listing won't be a boon for all", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on march 21 - 27, 2016.  at a glance, top glove corp bhds proposal for a secondary listing of its entire issued and paid-up capital on the main board of the singapore exchange (sgx) seems like an open door for shareholders to trade outside malaysia and remit money from the country. however, this is only viable for those with a huge number of shares. the secondary listing, which was announced last week, does not entail the issuance of new shares but allows existing shareholders to transfer their shares listed on bursa malaysia to sgx for trading. in its announcement, top glove says that to create liquidity and trading activity on sgx, the company will explore with its substantial shareholders the possibility of selling about s$20 million worth of shares on the open market there. the majority shareholder of the worlds largest rubber glove manufacturer is its founder and chairman tan sri lim wee chai, who holds a direct stake of 29.53% and an indirect stake of 8.27%. while investors would be glad that they have been given a choice to trade their shares either in malaysia or singapore, a seasoned trader says it might only be worth the trouble for those with a high volume of shares to trade. for investors with, say, 10,000 to 20,000 shares, it may not be worth it to transfer them to singapore because the charges can be quite high. top glove also says in its announcement that the secondary listing is expected to enhance its investor reach, diversify its investor base and allow the direct participation of investors in singapore. this is expected to increase the trading liquidity of top glove shares as singapore is widely recognised as a global financial hub with foreign companies representing more than 30% of the companies listed on sgx-st and supported by a high level of international participation. at the same time, the glove maker adds, the secondary listing will boost the companys profile among global investors, according it stronger brand awareness and wider research coverage. however, a deal maker points out that companies that had taken the dual listing road before were not doing very well on the city-states stock exchange. i dont think it would actually help increase liquidity. the stock is likely to see higher trading liquidity in malaysia than in singapore. take ihh healthcare bhd. its shares in singapore are trading at a significantly lower volume than on bursa. the liquidity is much higher on the malaysian stock exchange. in terms of share price appreciation, ihh healthcare has risen 95% since it was listed on sgx while on bursa, it has gained 133.7%. a veteran broker, meanwhile, says malaysia is known for its glove players in the global investing community, which makes it odd for top glove to have a secondary listing in singapore where the valuation of its shares will likely be lower. maybank investment bank research says in a report that top glove already has high liquidity and that a s$20 million share sale by its major shareholders would only represent about 1% of its total issued shares, which will not boost its liquidity substantially. additionally, the valuations of sgx-listed glove players are below those of their bursa-listed counterparts. thus, the secondary listing will not boost top gloves valuations. top glove closed at rm5.26 on bursa last thursday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm6.6 billion. it was trading at a forward price-earnings ratio (per) of 16 times and has risen 107% over the past year. singapore-listed glove maker, riverstone holdings ltd, which closed at s$1 on sgx last thursday, had a forward per of 15.81 times while its peer, ug healthcare ltd, last traded at s$0.385 with a forward per of 13.45 times. interestingly, both these companies saw an increase in their share price after top gloves announcement on march 14. riverstone grew 5.8% within four trading days while ug healthcare leapt 25.8%. according to a market expert, a secondary listing in singapore implies that it is something the shareholders want rather than the company itself. it is worth highlighting that several years ago, berjaya sports toto bhd (btoto) embarked on a similar quest but it fell through. btoto proposed to list its wholly-owned number forecast operator, sports toto malaysia sdn bhd, as a business trust in singapore and thereafter seek a secondary listing on bursa malaysia. the proposal came before the 2013 general election in malaysia. however, the plan was aborted despite receiving all the required approvals from the authorities because of the anticipation of interest rate hikes at the time and the poor performance of listed yield stocks. if all goes according to plan, top gloves listing in singapore should take place in june this year. in the second quarter ended feb 29, 2016, the companys net profit surged 86.6% year on year to rm104.61 million while revenue rose 21.3% to rm693.86 million.

shares in airasia started falling in june amid investor concern over a report by hong kong-based gmt research that had questioned the sustainability of the low-cost carriers accounting, cash flow and leverage. in august the same year, talk of airasias privatisation also surfaced, but the plan reportedly fell through due to funding issues. it would have cost fernandes and the related parties some rm2.11 billion to take over airasia then based on the closing price of 78 sen on aug 26, 2015. maybank investment bank research aviation analyst mohshin aziz said rumours of airasias privatisation had surfaced several times since the airline went public in november 2004, but there was never a formal offer made to airasia. as such, he believes that a privatisation was not as imminent as the market would have thought. however, he is of the view that the facts are unconvincing for it to happen this time around. airasia had called for an extraordinary general meeting on dec 15 last year to secure shareholders mandate to buy back 10% of its shares, sending a firm message that it is not for sale, said mohshin. he noted that airasia had commenced its first buy-back tranche shortly after announcing its fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2015 results in february this year. this maiden buy-back proves that the management is making good of its not for sale declaration. furthermore, tune air has not accumulated shares in airasia for the past 12 months, said mohshin."}, "200": {"date_posted": "29/3/2016", "title": "mohaiyani is first female chairman of a major maybank unit", "article": "

march 14 - 18, 2016. it is understood that felda global ventures holdings bhd (fgv) is out of a deal in which it was trying to buy equity interest in pt eagle high plantations tbk and other businesses from pt rajawali corpora of indonesia. instead, felda investment corp (fic) will buy a 37% stake in eagle high and equity interest in rajawalis sugar cane plantations and mills, says a source. this comes while fgv is in the process of acquiring a 55% stake in china-based zhong ling nutril-oil holdings ltd, one of the top 10 edible oil producers in the world, for rm976.25 million. this deal, which was announced on feb 26, is to balance out fgvs upstream and downstream businesses. fgv is completely out of the deal as fic muscles in, says the source about the indonesian deal. fic is the investment arm of the federal land development authority with a mandate to invest in non-plantation companies. with a total landbank of 425,000ha in kalimantan, papua, sulawesi and sumatra, eagle high is the third largest plantation company listed on the jakarta stock exchange. by buying a stake in the outfit in place of fgv, fic would be breaching its investment mandate. to recap, fgv first announced the deal on june 12 last year, after signing a heads of agreement with pt rajawali capital international for the acquisition of a 37% stake in eagle high for us$631.5 million (rm2.37 billion when the deal was announced) in cash and 2.77% of fgvs enlarged share base. as part of the deal, fgv also proposed to acquire 93.3% to 95% equity interest in rajawali corporas sugar cane plantations and mills for us$66.5 million (rm249 million). rajawali capital is a subsidiary of rajawali corpora, which is controlled by billionaire peter sondakh. fic is taking over from fgv to complete the deal, says the source. at press time, fgv president and ceo datuk emir mavani abdullah had not responded to messages sent to him. an fgv corporate communications representative declined to comment on the issue. fgv was heavily criticised by investors, observers and politicians alike after the deal was announced as it was deemed pricey. at the time, eagle high had a market value of us$1.04 billion, which meant fgv was paying a hefty premium for the 37% stake. however, emir defended the deal, saying fgv would only be paying enterprise value per planted hectare of us$17,400 compared with the us$29,500 paid by sime darby bhd for new britain palm oil ltd in 2014 and us$23,500 paid by ioi corp bhd for unico-desa plantations bhd in 2013. nevertheless, fgvs share price tumbled 11.3% from its close of rm1.795 on june 11 to rm1.592 on june 15 last year. trading in its shares was suspended on june 12, when the announcement was made. last friday, the stock closed at rm1.48, giving the company a market capitalisation of rm5.4 billion. analysts were mostly negative about the deal. a maybank investment bank research analyst said in a june 15 report that the deal was most likely to be negative for fgvs earnings in the near term after netting borrowing costs. affin hwang capital downgraded fgv to a hold from a buy recommendation, also on june 15. the research houses analyst ong keng wee said in his report that a rise in leverage and a potential earnings dilution might not be well received by short to medium-term investors. the selldown in fgvs shares following the announcement of the deal showed investors nervousness over the company making another big acquisition. emir had said that the deal, which would be partly financed by debt, would increase fgvs gearing ratio to 1.1 times equity from 0.72 times. previously, fgv had acquired pontian united plantations bhd for rm1.2 billion, the remaining 51% stake in felda holdings bhd for rm2.2 billion and asian plantations ltd for rm703.31 million. the group also announced the acquisition of a piece of land and four subsidiaries from golden land bhd for rm655 million. the acquisition of a 37% stake in eagle high would have made fgv the largest shareholder of the company but without management control. at the moment, rajawali corpora owns a 65.54% stake in eagle high. a definitive agreement on the deal was supposed to have been concluded by oct 31, 2015, but as the ringgit was depreciating rapidly then, the negotiations were extended to a date no later than nov 30. this deadline was also breached, taking the deal in its original form off the table. however, emir said fgv and rajawali corpora were exploring other forms of collaboration. this is when fic came into the picture as the potential buyer of the 37% stake. at the same time, it was speculated that fgv would take up a smaller stake in eagle high. according to fics website, the firm has investments in iris corp bhd, encorp bhd and barakah offshore petroleum bhd. it also operates felda residences hotel chains throughout the country and travel agency, felda travel. in the financial year ended dec 31, 2015 (fy2015), fgv recorded its first core loss of rm171.7 million since listing, according to maybank ib research, as the average selling price of crude palm oil of rm2,210 per tonne achieved that year was lower than the production cost of rm2,237 per tonne estimated by the bank. the group reported a net profit of rm117.1 million in fy2015, which was 64% lower than in the previous year despite revenue growing 2.7% to rm15.67 billion. if fgv is out of the deal, it would be a reprieve for the group and its shareholders as its balance sheet would be spared the additional strain, especially when the cpo price is so low. fgv would be able to focus on acquiring zhong ling instead and expand its downstream business. on the other hand, fic would have to justify the acquisition of plantation assets."}, "202": {"date_posted": "28/3/2016",

foreign funds continue to return to the local market amid the recent rebound in oil prices and the strengthening of the ringgit against the us dollar. year to date, the share price of tenaga nasional bhd (tnb) has appreciated about 4.95%, sime darby bhd went up 1.93%, public bank bhd has gained 1.75%, malayan banking bhd rose 5.83%, and nestle malaysia bhd is up 2.18%  in line with the constant influx of foreign funds. the benchmark fbm klci has gained over 100 points over the past few weeks, from touching levels around 1,600 in january, to close at 1,703.79 points last friday, indicating some steady buying support for index-linked counters. etiqa insurance & takaful head of research chris eng attributed the return of foreign funds to the strengthening ringgit, the poor performance of the fbm klci over the past two years and the gradual resolution of the 1malaysia development bhd (1mdb) issue. part of the return has been due to the strengthening ringgit, with hope for more strength, and the poor performance of the malaysian market over the last two years, with it being among the top three worst-performing regional markets in 2014 and 2015. the continued gradual resolution of the 1mdb issue, with the sale of edras (edra global energy bhd) power assets to chinese parties is also a positive for the local market, he told the edge financial daily. at the time of writing, the ringgit weakened 0.19% to trade at 4.0370 against the us dollar, while brent crude fell 0.07% to us$40.44.  eng said foreign buying will continue in the near term, but expects foreign selling to start picking up in the following month, as the april us corporate results season is likely to disappoint. a disappointment in us earnings will impact investors risk appetite, and it is likely that they will sell off their holdings of global equities, he explained. overall, eng said the buying activity will continue to push up the blue-chips, noting tnb as a good pick, as the stock is a beneficiary of the current hot weather, while the resolution of edra removed some overhang on the stock. m&a securities sdn bhd head of research rosnani rasul cited the improving outlook for the ringgit and oil prices as factors behind the return of foreign funds, which has supported recent gains in index-linked counters. the main choice of foreign funds has always been blue-chips, high liquidity and strong balance sheet counters, she said, adding that the foreign buying activity is expected to continue in the near term. according to midf researchs latest fund flow report, liquidity flow into the asian region remained elevated for the third consecutive week, with net foreign purchases for the malaysian bourse exceeding rm1 billion for the second week running, for the trading week ended march 18. it said foreign buyers purchased listed equities amounting to rm1.48 billion, a 42% increase on a week-on-week basis, and were net buyers through every day of the week. during the

the money flow, the haul in march is set to be the highest since april 2013, which was just before the general election, said the research house. according to bloombergs consensus, a number of

"}, "205": {"date_posted": "17/3/2016", "title": " more returns from etfs? (pt 2)", "article": " this article first appeared in personal wealth, the edge malaysia weekly, on march 7 - 13, 2016.  in volatile times like these, exchange-traded funds could play a bigger role in an investors portfolio. with some knowledge of macroeconomics and technical analysis, investors could trade in etfs to generate a higher return.  liquidity issue the lack of liquidity when it comes to investing and trading in etfs has always been seen as a challenge for investors. only 54.15 million units of etfs worth rm59.15 million changed hands in 2014, according to bursa malaysia. and only 7.86 million units of etfs worth rm9.96 million were traded in the first half of last year. bursa malaysia said last year that the fbm klcis single-day trading volume of about two billion shares easily surpasses the etfs total volume traded in a year. heavyweights such as malayan banking bhd see an average daily trading volume of about 10 million shares. this is one of the points cited by active fund managers who explain why etfs have not taken off in the past 10 years, as the price of etfs will not gain momentum without liquidity. while acknowledging the lack of liquidity in the open market is why etfs have not taken off in malaysia, mahdzir says you should not compare the trading volume of an etf with that of individual stocks. while etfs are traded like shares, the underlying structure is a unit trust structure, he points out. he also says the price of etf shares on the open market will always be in line with the net asset value of the shares. this is because the market maker, which is sitting behind the open market to provide liquidity for the etfs, will always make an arbitrage on the etf shares when the share price deviates away from the underlying net asset value. that is why individual investors should not see liquidity as a risk to their investment. the market makers are always there to provide [bid and offer] prices close to the prevailing nav of the etf and provide the liquidity. it is a misconception that etf share prices will collapse because of illiquidity, says mahdzir. a market maker plays an important role in facilitating the transactions of an etf, between the buyers and sellers of etf shares. they are usually investment banks and securities companies. a market maker sources for the securities based on the perfect basket of underlying shares that mirror an index advised by the fund manager (who designs, introduces and oversees the etf) and delivers a basket of underlying securities to the fund manager (through the custodian bank). the market maker in turn receives one creation unit issued by the fund manager (through the custodian bank as well). a creation unit is typically a large block of etf shares (a minimum of 400,000 shares). upon receiving the creation unit, the market maker can choose to hold on to the units or sell some or all of them on the open market based on the mark-to-market price of the net asset value. this is called the creation process. however, the market maker can also go through a redemption process, which is the reverse of the creation process. this means the market maker purchases etf shares on the open market, forms a creation unit and delivers it to the fund manager. the market maker then receives individual securities (which form the creation unit) to the exact net asset value of the creation unit. they can be kept or sold on the open market. the creation and redemption processes are important mechanisms to make sure the price of the etf shares is always in line with the net asset value of the etf. that is because when the price of the etf shares goes higher or lower than its net asset value, the market maker will execute an arbitrage and earn a risk-free profit. to provide liquidity, the market maker will come up with a bid and ask price on the open market and there is no liquidity issue for an individual investors to trade in etf shares even though the trading volume on the open market remains low. an etf share can be bought and sold by the market maker with a slight spread of about 0.5% of the net asset value, says mahdzir. why is it that you can buy into a unit trust fund without asking about liquidity, but are so worried about liquidity when you buy into an etf? the sales charge for unit trust funds is about 5% and the spread [of the etf share price and net asset value] to buy into an etf is only about 0.5%. etfs do not impose a sales charge on investors and the management fee is lower than 1%. last year, i-vcap came out with three etf products to offer more options to the market and to create more depth and awareness of the etf sector. there are more etf products in its pipeline, including products with a regional focus and sector focus, depending on market demand. the awareness now, compared with four years ago when i came on board, has actually increased and we do get a lot of interest, though not as much as we would like. now, the challenge is to convert the awareness of the product into actual trading, says mahdzir.  challenges faced by etfs maznah says she does not see aminvest launching any new etf products in the near future. there isnt a compelling business reason [for us to launch new etfs]. we positioned ourselves as an early bird because you never know when such trends pick up. we launched the first two and that would be it for now. but why havent etfs taken off in malaysia despite a much lower fee compared with unit trust funds and giving investors easier access to markets around the world? maznah says it is partly because the most active funds in malaysia and emerging markets have continued to beat the market, which it benchmarks against, owing to market inefficiencies. this is unlike the stock markets in developed countries such as the us, where the markets are efficient and active fund managers strive hard to outperform them. for instance, the klci was down about 3% and many active fund managers happily beat that. for example, the return for our ammalaysia equity fund last year was 12.23%. and its not only us, many funds out there in asia have performed well too. so, why should investors look into plain vanilla etfs? she says. an industry player who does not wish to be named has a different view on why etfs have not taken off locally despite providing investors with broader investment options. one of the reasons etfs have not taken off is partly because the fees for them to be listed on the stock exchange are high, and the only stream of revenue for the fund manager is the management fee, which ranges from 0.5% to 0.7% per annum. it is a good product for the public, but it is not viable unless it gets the size and volume. an etf provider is required to appoint an adviser and lawyer, for instance, to get its product listed on the stock exchange. it could be much more expensive to launch compared with a unit trust fund. and this has not taken into account the cost of marketing and promoting the product. more regulatory incentives should be given to encourage etf providers and market makers to launch more etfs, the industry player adds. another reason etfs have not taken off locally is that there is no incentive for intermediaries such as agents and financial planners to push the products in the market. unit trust agents and financial planners push products because of the commissions they get. of course, they hope the products can attract a good return for them, says mahdzir. this, he points out, compares with the developed market, where regulators have got rid of the commission-based structure and replaced it with a fee-based structure. thus, financial planners in the developed market tend to promote funds and investment products that have the least cost to their clients. maznah says, nobody will sell etfs even if they offers 0% fee for investors and are the best products in the world because the intermediaries get no incentive for selling them. this is the same even in the uk, which is seen as an international financial centre. it was only recently that etfs took off in the uk because its regulators changed the regulations on retrocession fees to distributors. however, she remains positive about the future of etfs as they have taken the world by storm, especially in the developed markets that have done away with the commission-based structure on all products, including unit trust funds. looking at the trend in the world, etfs are more likely to take off if they are supported by a change in regulations.

edge financial daily, on march 16, 2016.  kuala lumpur: top glove corp bhds proposal to seek a secondary listing on the mainboard of the singapore exchange (sgx) did not add much excitement to the glove makers share price that has retreated from its record high of rm6.69 in january. analysts who track the stock concur it is a positive move, as it provides the worlds largest glove maker a platform to tap into another equity market. basically, a secondary listing is a way for the company to market its shares on an international platform, and will provide better exposure to foreign participants. from a shareholders perspective, it provides options to seek better valuations in the singapore stock market, said ta securities research analyst wilson loo. in its announcement to bursa malaysia on monday, top glove noted that it intends to explore with its substantial shareholders the possibility of selling a portion of their shareholdings in the company of approximately s$20 million (rm60.14 million) in value in the open market in singapore. however, maybank investment bank research said that top glove already offers high liquidity, and the s$20 million share sale by its main shareholders works out to about 1% of total shares issued, which will not add substantially into its liquidity. additionally, valuations of sgx-listed glove players are also below that of bursa malaysia-listed glove players, hence the secondary listing will not boost top gloves valuations, the research house said in its note yesterday. meanwhile, midf research said top gloves sgx listing will allow the company to exercise flexibility in terms of raising funds for both growth and operations in the future. furthermore, as the company is actively looking into mergers and acquisitions (m&a) of smaller players and glove-related players, we think the listing will assist in broadening the companys m&a horizon and boost attractiveness to both potential targets and also future investors, said midf in its note yesterday. top glove is expected to release its quarterly result today. uob kay hian malaysia analyst lester chin kent lake told the edge financial daily that he expects top gloves earnings to be weaker in the the second financial quarter ended feb 29, 2016 (2qfy16) due to the weaker us dollar and the recovery in latex prices. another analyst begs to differ, expecting top gloves 2qfy16 results to be as good as in 1qfy16, even though the ringgit has strengthened by about 7% since january 2016. based on [an] average basis, [in] 1qfy16 (september to november 2015) the ringgit stood at 4.2919 against the us dollar, while in 2qfy16 (december 2015 to february 2016) the ringgit was at 4.2673. the us dollar only depreciated 1% on a q-o-q (quarter-on-quarter) basis, she said. drivers for the group include its continuous cost efficiency and robust demand for gloves. the malaysian rubber glove manufacturers association is expecting glove annual growth rate at 6% to 8% this year, the analyst added. for 1qfy16, top gloves profit more than doubled to rm128.3 million from rm48.7 million in 1qfy15. revenue, meanwhile, was at an all-time quarterly high of rm800.3 million, a 41% increase from rm567.6 million a year ago. top gloves share price was unchanged at rm5.35 yesterday, with a market capitalisation of rm1.25 billion. the stock has fallen 21.5%

article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on february 15 - 21, 2016.  bimb holdings bhds share price has taken a beating recently because of the controversy surrounding its controlling shareholder lembaga tabung hajis (lth) reserve funds. are the concerns overblown? the share price fell for two weeks straight from jan 18, shedding 16.3% to sink to a three-year low of rm3.24 on feb 2 and 3. midf research, in a report a day later, upgraded the stock to a trading buy from neutral as it felt the sell-off was overdone and not reflective of the groups fundamental value. however, it maintains its target price for the stock at rm4.22. the furore surrounding lths negative fund reserves has, in our opinion, raised unfounded concerns that some of its assets may be liquidated soon in order to be able to pay dividends to its depositors, midf research says. with its share price trailing underlying fundamental value, we advocate investors to take advantage of this knee-jerk price action. after hitting its low point, bimbs stock then went on to recoup some of the losses of the previous two weeks, gaining 8% to reach rm3.50 on feb 5, before continuing its steep downward spiral. it closed at rm3.43 last friday. lth holds a 53.94% stake in bimb, which wholly owns bank islam malaysia bhd, and has a 60.3% stake in listed islamic insurer syarikat takaful malaysia bhd (stmb). unlike bimb, stmb has not seen any major deviation in its share price trend over the last few weeks. bimbs other substantial shareholders are the employees provident fund (12.65%), kumpulan wang persaraan (5.92%), permodalan nasional bhd (5.84%) and skim amanah saham bumiputera (5.21%). bimbs latest annual report suggests that lth has demand and investment deposits within the group to the tune of rm2.639 billion as at fy2014. there are rumours that some of this could be pulled out, which could lead to liquidity issues for bank islam ... but i dont really think these concerns are valid, an analyst tells the edge. late last month, lth was drawn into controversy after it was revealed that it had received a letter from bank negara malaysia warning that its reserves were slipping into negative territory, as it had 98 sen in assets for each ringgit in liabilities and, as such, may not be able to pay dividends to its nine million depositors. lth acknowledged receiving the letter, but said that if its investment portfolios were taken into account, its assets outweighed its liabilities. in a statement last wednesday, it rejected claims that it resorted to creative accounting in preparing its financial statements, saying they were drawn up according to standards set by the malaysian accounting standards board. the fund said it was still in the black after paying out dividends and bonuses for 2015, and did not dip into its reserves for the payout as suggested by certain quarters. still, while bimbs stock may be trading at attractive levels now, not all analysts are rushing to recommend a buy on it. most have maintained their neutral calls. while it may well be true that the lth reserves issue wont have a direct impact on bimb, the fact is that the more challenging economic outlook for this year will keep bimb on its toes. maybank investment bank (mib) research downgraded its call on bimb to hold from buy on feb 1 and cut its target price by 70 sen to rm3.80. kenanga research, too, downgraded the stock to underperform from market perform on jan 22. as consumer sentiment continues to weaken, we are taking a more conservative view towards bank islams personal financing portfolio and have factored in higher credit costs. we lower our fy2016 and fy2017 earnings forecasts for bimb by 6% and 7% respectively and ... downgrade the stock, mib researchs banking analyst desmond chng says in the report. bank islam accounts for the bulk of bimbs earnings. the personal financing (pf) business currently accounts for about 31% of bank islams total financing portfolio. mib research notes that as at end-june 2015, some 90% of its pf took the form of package financing  the loans are serviced through direct salary deductions  and of this, half were to civil servants, 21% to employees of government-linked companies and the rest to private sector employees. on a positive note, the banks exposure to the troubled oil and gas (o&g) sector is low. financing of private sector employees in the o&g segment accounted for 4.8% (some rm420 million) of total package financing or only about 1.3% of bank islams total financing portfolio. so far, the banks gross non-performing financing (npf) ratio is well in check. it stood at a benign 1.14% as at end-september 2015, about the same level as at the start of that year, while financing loss coverage was a respectable 172%. the gross npf for pf alone has been impeccable at less than 1%, mib research notes. nevertheless, with consumer sentiment on the wane and living costs on the rise, we are taking a more conservative view of credit costs and have raised our fy2016 credit charge forecast for bank islam to 36 basis points (bps) from 27 bps. mib research sees bimbs gross npf ratio moving up marginally to 1.2% in fy2015 and 1.3% in fy2016. bank islam ceo datuk seri zukri samat, who also heads bimb, acknowledges that the bank is likely to see slower growth this year given the more challenging economic conditions. this will be a challenging year. the (overall) growth will be slower than in 2015. i hope the bank will maintain double-digit growth in terms of financing performance as achieved last year, he told reporters last month after a bank event. announcing its headline targets for fy2016 last month, bimb said it aspires for return on equity (roe) of 20% based on its profit before zakat and tax (pbtz). this is lower than the 23% target it set for fy2015. analysts see it making a net profit of rm526.5 million in fy2015, which would be a 1.1% decline from the rm532.2 million it made in fy2014. for the first nine months of fy2015, net profit came in at rm385.4 million, some 1.8% higher than in the same period a year ago. bank islams pbtz stood at rm529.6

"title": "property developers dangling big carrot in front of the markets nose", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on february 8 - 14, 2016  with the demand for property slipping, competition among property developers chasing a shrinking market has become stiffer. companies such as ioi properties bhd and mah sing group bhd are getting more innovative and holding out big carrots to prospective buyers. ioi properties, for example, has a buy now, pay later scheme. under the scheme, if a buyer obtains an 80% loan on the property, he is allowed to stagger the payments for the remaining 20%, which he would normally have to pay up front. depending on the development and the handover period of the project, we are able to defer the outstanding amount a buyer has to pay after deducting the loan amount from the bank. the deferred payment can be done in instalments over a period, says a sales agent with the company. meanwhile, mah sing has an ongoing chinese new year special that gives buyers an additional rm8,888 cash rebate when they purchase any of the groups participating properties. according to its website, the offer is valid until the end of this month and it is on top of the existing rebates, discounts and incentives offered for its other developments. for example, the rm8,888 is in addition to a 25% discount on mah sings m-suites in jalan ampang, says a sales agent with the company. the two-bedroom units in the 900 sq ft range are priced at about rm1 million before the 25% discount. the units are semi-furnished and have value-added things such as kitchen cabinets, a washing machine, heater, air con and fridge, the agent says, adding that the 25% discount was introduced a few months ago. indeed, property developers will need to use a whole new bag of tricks to attract buyers in a slowing market. however, say analysts, their margins will not be badly affected. they wont sacrifice too much of their margins. we must remember that the prices of property had gone up over the years. the reason behind the rebates and discounts given today is to help generate sales as demand has fallen too much u2026 it is to help buyers so that they dont have to fork out so much money up front and to entice them to buy, says a property analyst with a local research house. the operating margins of property developers ranged from 20% to 35% as at sept 30, 2015. property analysts say a big concern today for developers is the lack of demand in the market now, which has hit their top line. margins may weaken but there is still room for them to adjust. steel and cement prices are coming down. on top of that, some of them have low land cost. a more pressing issue for developers today is sales u2026 they have a buffer now, thanks to unbilled sales, but if they are not able to grow new sales, their top line will be hit eventually when the unbilled sales taper off and new sales trend downwards, says another property analyst. as at sept 30, 2015, uem sunrise bhd had rm4.1 billion of unbilled sales while sunway bhd had rm1.7 billion. eco world development group bhd had rm4.2 billion of unbilled sales as at october 2015 while s p setia bhd had rm9.5 billion. moving forward, property analysts do not expect developers to drop launch prices to entice buyers as that would have a cascading effect. what we will see happen is that they will keep the asp (average selling price) but have smaller units. for example, three bedrooms in a 950 sq ft unit. so, the total value of the property is lower but the asp is the same because of the smaller size, says the analyst. weakness in residential loans that the demand for residential properties has fallen is evident from bank negara malaysias statistics. the number of loans applied for such properties fell between june and december 2015. in fact, the number of loans applied for in december 2015 were down 16% year on year. about rm14.9 billion worth of loans were applied for to acquire residential properties in december 2014 compared with rm17.7 billion in december 2015. on top of this, loans approved for residential properties were down 25% y-o-y to rm7.35 billion in december 2015. meanwhile, impaired loans for the purchase of properties rose every month between april and september 2015. from rm4.953 billion in april 2015, these trended up to rm5.159 billion in september 2015. impaired loans had slowed to rm5.03 billion in december 2015 but were still higher than the rm5.01 billion recorded a year ago. maybank investment bank research remains negative on the property sector from a top-down perspective. the sector lacks a strong re-rating catalyst and the slowdown in property demand could extend another 12 months to 2017. consequently, it could take a while longer to realise values. the negative lag impact on earnings from weaker sales will start to feature from 2017 onwards, it states in a jan 13 report. property stocks under our coverage are trading at an average discount of 36% to 62% to our rnav estimates compared with a 50% to 70% discount during the gfc (global financial crisis). we advocate investors to go defensive in bottom-up stock selection. s p setia bhd (rm3.86 target price) is our buy pick for the property sector. kenanga research is neutral on the property sector. we believe 2016 will be challenging and it is too early to tell if 2h2016 will be better than 1h2015. recall that most developers are facing limited demand visibility, as experienced in 2015, while tight lending liquidity to the sector persists, it states in a jan 7 report. we like uoa development bhd (rm2.22 target price; net cash position and net yield of 6.8% with idrp) as a defensive pick. for those willing to take a longer-term view of deep-value developers, we recommend hua yang bhd (rm2.20 target price), which is trading at a compelling 4.4 times forward per (close to the historical trough) with high exposure to the affordable housing market in the klang valley and offers a very strong yield of 7%. we also expect a re-rating of eco world development group bhd (rm1.90 target price) closer to its eco world

stronger downstream contributions.  we expect the group to achieve a headline net profit of at least rm520 million (2qfy15: +rm20 million) in 2qfy16. core net profit-wise, we expect it to be about rm306 million, increases by 127% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) or 4% year-on-year (y-o-y). the sharp q-o-q turnaround is largely due to an estimated forex translation gain of rm221 million (1qfy16 loss of rm719 million) on its us dollar debt exposure as the ringgit strengthened against the us dollar by about 3.5% during the quarter. operationally, iois plantation division recorded a weaker 2qfy16 fresh fruit bunch (ffb) output of 934,811 tonnes (-3% q-o-q, -7% y-o-y), mainly due to below-average rainfall experienced in sabah in the first half of 2015 (1h15). higher sequential crude palm oil (cpo) average selling price (+5% q-o-q, -2% y-o-y) and palm kernel average selling price (+20% q-o-q, +17% y-o-y) will likely result in stronger q-o-q plantation earnings before interest and tax (ebit) of rm256 million (+9% q-o-q, -3% y-o-y). as for downstream, we expect an ebit of rm180 million (1qfy16: -rm25 million) due to the absence of rm203 million fair valuation loss on derivative financial instruments recorded in 1qfy16. ioi is the best proxy to an el nino induced cpo price rally in 1h16 given the high liquid nature of the stock and large market cap. its reinclusion in the

since that rm3.09 high, flb has fallen to its recent low of rm2.01 this month. as prices broke above their recent key critical support levels of rm2.32 and rm2.69, look to sell flb on any rallies to

merger", "article": " this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on january 11 - 17, 2016. a major issue being argued out in the proposed merger between malaysia building society bhd (mbsb) and bank muamalat malaysia bhd is who should be the controlling shareholder in the merged islamic banking entity. both the employees provident fund (epf), which is mbsbs largest shareholder with a 65% stake, and diversified conglomerate drb-hicom bhd, which owns 70% of bank muamalat, want to be the controlling shareholder, sources say. a merger between mbsb and bank muamalat would create the countrys largest stand-alone islamic bank with some rm62.1 billion in assets. it would be the second largest islamic bank after maybank islamic bank bhd. both the epf and drb-hicom want to be the controlling shareholder. a decision needs to be made by the end of this month. its unlikely mbsb will go into this merger if the epf is not in control of the merged entity, a source tells the edge. the parties involved in the merger talks have yet to meet this year as they are waiting for bank negara malaysia to approve their application to extend the deadline to conclude their negotiations to feb 2. the central bank had originally given them three months up to dec 30, 2015, to complete the negotiations. on dec 23, mbsb had said in a stock exchange filing that it as well as drb-hicom and khazanah nasional bhd  the holder of the remaining 30% stake in bank muamalat  had applied for a one-month extension. as at last thursday, approval was still pending. sources, however, say they do not anticipate any problems getting the extension. based on the talks so far, the merger is likely to be effected via a share swap. it was initially expected that the shareholding structure of the merged entity would be such that the epf ends up as the largest shareholder with a stake of up to 40% or so, with drb-hicom holding over 20% and khazanah, about 10%. but it seems like drb-hicom wants the higher shareholding now, the source says. banking sources say it makes more sense that the epf/mbsb party be in control of the merged entity given that mbsb is about twice the size of bank muamalat in terms of assets. furthermore, over 80% of their combined revenue and profit before tax (pbt) would come from mbsb. mbsbs pbt in its last financial year ended dec 31, 2014, was rm932.56 million while bank muamalats profit before zakat and tax in its last financial year ended march 31, 2015, was about rm122 million. based on these historical numbers, mbsb accounts for 88.4% of the combined profit. moving forward, looking at the forecast numbers, most of the income [of the merged entity] is expected to come from mbsbs assets. so, going by that, it doesnt make sense for the entity to be under drb-hicoms control, the earlier source says. some analysts say, from a perception standpoint, the market is likely to have a more positive view of the epf being the controlling shareholder. the epf, with its deep pockets, is seen to be more able to support things like a capital call, if needed, than drb-hicom, which is currently struggling amid the weaker economy. drb-hicom, controlled by businessman tan sri syed mokhtar albukhary, recently reported a net loss of rm15.82 million for the six months ended sept 30, 2015, compared with a net profit of rm200.93 million in the previous corresponding period, dragged down by its automotive and property sectors. revenue also fell, by 10.7% to rm6.2 billion. bank muamalat accounted for about 7% of drb-hicoms rm13.687 billion revenue in the last financial year ended march 31, 2015. drb-hicom had bought its 70% stake in bank muamalat from bukhary capital sdn bhd  also controlled by syed mokhtar  in a rm1.069 billion deal back in 2008. bank negara had allowed the deal, on condition that it would eventually pare down the stake. drb-hicom has been given several deadline extensions to do so. previous attempts to sell down its stake to several financial institutions, namely affin holdings bhd, bank islam malaysia bhd and bahrain-based islamic lender al baraka, had failed. industry sources say it had been difficult for drb-hicom to close a deal with any of the parties, for two reasons  it wanted to maintain control of the bank and its price expectations were deemed too high. but it may just have its back against the wall now. the edge reported in july last year that the central bank had given drb-hicom up to february 2016  said to be the final extension  to pare down its stake in bank muamalat to at least 40%. it will be interesting to see if drb-hicom can work out a deal with mbsb and the other parties over the next few weeks. should they be able to do so, sources say the merger can be completed by october."}, "219":

and 1,727.41 (high). the indexs decline from 1,867.53 (april 2015) to 1,503.68 (august 2015) is in a perfect 1.62 ratio of the initial down-thrust from a high of 1,896.23 (july 2014) to the 1,671.82 low (december 2014). the subsequent rebound from the 1,503.68 low stalled at a 1,727.41 high, which was also a perfect upward 62% retracement of the 1,867.53 to 1,503.68 move. the indexs next two minor swings comprised a minor low of 1,622.84, which then rebounded and stalled at a 1,706.25 minor high on dec 30, 2015. its persistent weaker price action in january 2016 was in tandem with the softer tone for global markets and the index broke the minor support of 1,622.84 on jan 18, 2016. the indexs daily signals are all negative, with its commodity channel index (cci), directional movement index (dmi), oscillator, moving average convergence divergence (macd), and stochastic indicators showing major negative signals. as such, the indexs support levels are seen at 1,503, 1,567 and 1,595, while heavy liquidation at the resistance areas of 1,600, 1,675 and 1,727 will cap any index rebound. the fbm klcis 18-day and 40-day simple moving averages (sma) depict an emerging downtrend for its short-term daily chart. the indexs price bars are below the 50-day and 200-day daily smas, and this depicts a downward phase for the fbm klci in the medium to longer term too. we also recently sighted a death cross of the 50-day and 200-day smas for the indexs weekly chart. this will not augur well for the index in the longer term and for 2016. our downside targets for the index are now located at the 1,580, 1,549 and 1,490 levels. due to the weaker tone for the fbm klci, we are recommending a chart sell on pos malaysia holdings bhd (pos). a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that five research houses cover this stock, with two neutral calls and three sell calls. pos provides postal and related services, printing and insertion, and sale of digital certificates. the current price-earnings ratio was at a decent 13.5 times, while the price-to-book ratio was at a marginally elevated level of 1.08 times. the return on equity was recorded at a level of 8.2%. although its revenue increased, the earnings per share dropped significantly from 4.2 sen to 0.6 sen quarter-on-quarter due to higher operating expenses. pos chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly down. its share price has made an obvious plunge since its major weekly wave-5 high of rm5.67 in november 2013. since that rm5.67 high, pos fell to its recent january 2016 low of rm2.22. as prices broke above their recent key critical support levels of rm2.59 and rm3.35, look to sell pos on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term downtrend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (such as the cci, dmi, oscillator, stochastic and macd) have issued clear sell signals and now show firm and obvious indications of pos eventual plunge towards lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm2.22, rm2.59 and rm3.35. we expect pos to witness weak buying activities at its support levels of rm1.88, rm2 and rm2.18. its downside targets are located at rm0.62, rm1.17 and rm1.47. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views

weekly, on december 28, 2015 - january 3, 2016.  icon offshore bhd, which prides itself on being the largest pure offshore support vessel (osv) provider in malaysia, has had a rough voyage since its listing on bursa malaysia in june 2014. some may blame it on the bad timing of the initial public offer by its controlling shareholder ekuiti nasional bhd (ekuinas). its share price tanked shortly after the debut and shed 80.5% from rm1.85 in june 2014 to 36 sen last tuesday  barely one-fifth of the ipo price of rm1.85. those who have a long-term view on the stock seem to think that the share price has reached the floor, barring any unforeseen circumstances. this nascent optimism stems from the fact that the company has seen signs of improvement operationally in its third quarter ended sept 30, 2015 (3qfy2015). for one, the utilisation rate of its vessels improved to 61% from 58% in the previous quarter, albeit still lower than 79% a year ago. meanwhile, its tender success rate also improved to 45%, compared with 33% in the previous quarter.   icon offshore chalked up net profit of rm5.53 million in 3qfy2015, an improvement from rm4.57 million in 2qfy2015 but still far less than the rm18.95 million recorded in 3qfy2014. more importantly, it has a new management. oil and gas industry veteran amir hamzah azizan will take over the helm as managing director effective march 1 next year. amir, son of the late petronas ceo tan sri azizan zainul abidin, will be leaving the national oil company. he is currently ceo of petronas lubricants international. he was also at the helm of petronas dagangan bhd and misc bhd previously. his appointment is expected to boost investor confidence, says maybank investment research. in addition, captain hassan ali has been appointed chief operating officer while ekuinas ceo datuk abdul rahman ahmad has been redesignated to executive director from non-executive director previously. ekuinas has the lions share in icon offshore, holding a 48.5% stake through its vehicles hallmark odyssey sdn bhd and sempena fokus sdn bhd. the change in management will definitely help. before this, it felt as though there was not really anyone in charge of things, comments an analyst. shortly after its debut, icon offshore was hit hard by the plunge in global crude oil prices from the peak of us$115 per barrel. by january this year, crude oil prices had more than halved to us$46.59 per barrel. early this month, they were at around us$36. as if the weakness in crude oil prices wasnt bad enough, icon offshore suffered another blow in april when its then ceo dr jamal yusof and coo rahman yusof were sought by the malaysian anti-corruption commission to assist in investigations. until today, the nature of their involvement in the investigations has not been disclosed, but both men have resigned from the company. the company also had to deal with rumours of falsification of its bollard pull certificates for some of its vessels. it has denied all allegations. however, the future looks brighter. maybank research says in a recent report that icon offshore has outperformed its peers in terms of cost management, noting that its osv peers are in the red despite operating at higher utilisation levels. icons ability to cost-down effectively and in a timely manner is commendable, with management having placed emphasis on fuel consumption optimisation, overhead cuts and savings from proactive vessel lay-ups and minimal safe manning, where possible, says maybank research. an analyst says petronas preference for malaysian vessel owners will help companies like icon offshore. in fact, maybank research mentions in its report that the company had secured two charter wins in the third quarter and another three jobs in the fourth quarter at a time when its peers were being hit by early termination of contracts. but with crude oil prices hovering around us$40 per barrel, petronas is having a hard time too. i think they will not be able to assist much unless oil prices rebound. that will be a catalyst for icon, opines the analyst. looking at icon offshores balance sheet, short-term borrowings at rm158.76 million is more than five times the amount of cash available at rm29.78 million. the companys times interest earned stands at only 1.64 times, based on its 3qfy2015 earnings. according to maybank research, icon offshores balance sheet discipline is evident from its decision to defer delivery of four new osvs and terminate the purchase of an osv asset to conserve its cash flow. the company planned to embark on a refinancing exercise, but so far, there hasnt been any firm answer on that aspect. it would be difficult to refinance during such times, when liquidity is shrinking, and i dont think banks are very keen on refinancing oil and gas companies, says an analyst. at its current share price of 36 sen apiece, icon offshore is trading at a price-earnings ratio of 4.66 times. the stock has a buy and three hold calls. only time will tell whether the new management will be able to continue turning around the company in an industry that is perceived by some to be overcrowded, at least for now.

between daily fixings since august, it said. alliancedbs research in its evening edition thursday said despite the up close in the preceding day, the fbm klci had on jan 7 opened on a weak note as

(part 1)", "article": " this article first appeared inpersonal wealth, the edge malaysia weekly, on dec 28, 2015 - jan 3, 2016.  the globalinvestment landscape has changed rapidly in recent years. major economic events like the 2008 global financial crisis have caused traditional assets to depreciate, thus giving rise to alternative investments and instruments that help investors preserve their wealth. however, not all alternative investments have taken root in malaysia. some instruments like etfs are still establishing their presence despite being offered for the past decade, while other newer options like retail bonds are still finding their footing. bitcoin continues to be volatile, although the use of the digital currency as a mode of payment has become more widely accepted. all eyes will be on equity crowdfunding (ecf) next year as the six approved local platforms launch their operations. below is a round-up of how the four investment options have developed and performed this year. etfs exchange-traded funds (etfs) are widely traded in developed markets, but not in malaysia, where 17.5 million units of local etfs were traded in 2014, according to bloomberg data. although that has increased 66% to 28.8 million units as at dec 18, it is still below the industrys expectation. for comparison, the fbm klcis average daily trading volume is about two billion shares while heavyweights such as malayan banking bhd have an average daily trading volume of about 10 million shares. a reason for the slow growth of the industry is because etfs are not considered a profitable product for local fund managers as they carry low transaction charges compared with unit trust funds. mahdzir othman, ceo of i-vcap management sdn bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of valuecap sdn bhd, has seen the trading performance of etfs improve this year. the increase shows that investors, particularly retail, are warming up to the idea of investing in etfs, possibly due to the increased understanding of the product, he says, adding that the company has been collaborating with bursa malaysia to educate the investing public on etfs. nonetheless, as the volume is not significant [compared with listed stocks], investor education activities will continue to be carried out to see greater participation. the company has introduced four islamic etfs into the market thus far. mahdzir says the company has been working with financial intermediaries such as commercial banks to push more products into the market. we have more products in the pipeline, he adds. the first etf was launched in 2005. to date, there have been eight etfs trading on the local bourse, launched by three providers. this is a far cry from neighbouring markets like singapore, which has 86 etfs trading (as at dec 18). this year alone, i-vcap launched two products  the myetf msci malaysian south east asia islamic dividend and myetf thomson reuters asia pacific ex-japan islamic agribusiness. in comparison, only six products have been launched in the past 10 years. but have etfs delivered the desired returns to investors? pong teng siew, head of research at inter-pacific securities sdn bhd, does not think so. he says etfs have faded away from the radar screens of investors in recent years, as people turn to other derivatives for higher returns. pong attributes the lacklustre trading performance of local etfs to their relatively low returns as they passively mirror the movement of an index. the lack of liquidity is another reason. local indices such as the klci do not move much and are not volatile. etfs wont give investors as handsome a payoff as an individual stocks do. they are more boring and people dont want to trade in them, he says. pong believes the industry can be further improved if more sector-focused etfs are introduced. he singles out the oil and gas sector as it is getting harder for investors to look at individual stocks amid the volatile market. an oil and gas etf would be able to provide a broad view to investors in the sector and this would be much better for them, he says, adding that the plantation sector might also pick up in the future. while admitting that there is low trading volume in the etf market, mahdzir believes this is mainly due to low investor awareness of the product. but he does not think etfs provide a lower return to investors compared with other products such as unit trust funds. in fact, only about 25% of the unit trust funds out there really beat the market, if you take into account the various fees they charge investors. etfs are low cost and charge low fees. if you look at the lipper table [which shows the performance of unit trust funds and etfs], the returns of etfs are high if you take into account the 5% sales charge of the unit trust, he says. mahdzir is confident etfs will eventually take off in a big way in malaysia as this is happening in the rest of the world, especially in developed nations. people are pulling out their money from unit trust funds and putting it into etfs in other parts of the world. etfs are taking off slower in asia, but you can see them getting more popular in countries such as singapore, hong kong and south korea. bitcoin bitcoin has come a long way since its launch in 2009 by its creator who goes by the moniker of satoshi nakamoto. it is now accepted by more than 100,000 merchants worldwide, according to figures compiled by bitpay, the leading bitcoin platform based in atlanta. in comparison, only about 60,000 merchants accepted bitcoin in april last year, according to coindesk, a provider of news and information on digital currencies and its underlying technology. among the companies that accepted bitcoin payments in the last few years were microsoft, dell, paypal, rakuten, amazon, wikipedia, i-pmart and expedia. bitcoin can be traded, transferred, mined and used to pay for goods and services. the bitcoin price index (bpi) crashed on jan 14, dropping 22% overnight to us$177.28. it was said to be due to mining operations and other cryptocurrency services that ponied up their liabilities by selling bitcoins. this brought down the value of the currency, which led to a rush to dispose of it. this year also saw the introduction of rules to regulate the emerging technology. in june, the new york state department of financial services adopted bitlicense, the first virtual currency-specific licensing regime to address bitcoin and digital currencies. the guidelines are aimed at protecting consumers, preventing money laundering and boosting cybersecurity.  then, a number of prominent bitcoin companies in new york ceased operations and relocated to other states as the regulations involved high costs and difficult paperwork. bitstamp, the worlds third largest exchange in terms of btc/usd trading volume, estimated its entire application to cost us$100,000, including time allocation to process the paperwork and legal and compliance fees. the highest price for bitcoin this year at the time of writing was us$465.50 and the lowest being during in january crash. although bitcoin did not perform well in the first half of 2015, colbert low, the founder of bitcoinmalaysia.com, says its price rose in the second half. during 3q and 4q, bitcoin prices increased 20% and 40%. a lot of users came back to stock up on bitcoins, he says. he adds that this was because malaysian bitcoin users treated bitcoin as a type of commodity investment instead of using it for payments. in western countries, the users treat bitcoin as a payment system. they use it to buy things online, or even get discounts on their coffee if they go to starbucks and pay via the fold app. but in malaysia, they always treat it as a commodity investment, it is the typical asian mindset. according to lows website, local merchants that began accepting bitcoin this year include codashop (provider of steam wallets, itunes and google play gift cards), bitstore.com.my  which sells yubikeys (a security authentication device)  jeq in the house cafu00e9 in petaling jaya and ruznor corner in johor baru. there is no way to determine the number of bitcoin users because of its pseudonymous nature. low says the numbers are growing steadily in malaysia  about 100 new users per day. many people are coming on board. i manage a chat group that discusses the use of bitcoin and i get a lot of requests to join the group, he says. several new bitcoin platforms have emerged in malaysia. one of them is coinbit.me, which offers services such as trading, payment and referral programmes. launched in april, it now has 19,357 members. with the rise of online scams and sites that offer fake cryptocurrencies, low says bitcoin users need to be more careful and make sure that they go to trusted exchangers and traders such as the largest bitcoin exchanger in malaysia, bitx.

[in fact] it had been overly strong. i suppose this year has marked the end of that credit cycle. we expect loan growth to be slower next year, with net interest margin (nim) continuing to be compressed, inter-pacific securities sdn bhd head of research pong teng siew told the edge financial daily. based on bank negara malaysias monthly data, malaysias total loan growth has been slowing since as early as july 2012. though the numbers increased moderately a year later, they continued to be subdued from january 2014 onwards. pong said that the fatigued loan growth is slowing down the banking systems money creation process. at this point, banks are not only competing for creditworthy clients, they are also putting more emphasis on deposit levels, as they are seeing their loan-to-deposit ratios (ldrs) climbing, he said. ldrs are used to assess a banks liquidity by dividing the banks total loans by its total deposits. if the ratio is too high, then the bank may not have enough liquidity to cover unforseen fund requirements. if the ratio is too low, it may not be earning as much as it could be. nevertheless, pong does not expect deposit interest rate to surge drastically in 2016 as malaysian banks need to juggle their offering rate with cost of fund, to maintain sustainable nim. during the third quarter ended sept 30, 2015 (3qfy15), all nine malaysian banks saw their net ldrs rise between 0.2 and 8.8 percentage points. on dec 15, fitch ratings revised the sector outlook for malaysian banks to negative in 2016 due to greater pressure on earnings and asset quality. it forecast gross domestic product (gdp) growth to ease to 4.4% in 2016 from 4.7% this year, with a potential for further downside. consumer and business confidence has declined, suggesting further softness in domestic demand, if prolonged. relatively high household debt [88% of gdp at end-2014] may make consumers even more cautious in an uncertain economy. [as such,] our negative banking sector outlook incorporates some downside risk to current economic growth forecasts, it said in the report 2016 outlook: asia-pacific banks. fitch also sees some borrowers facing difficulty in adjusting to the significant currency depreciation over the past 12 to18 months. we believe these developments translate into lower loan growth and higher credit costs in the next one to two years, it said. the agency also expects the recent rise in non-performing loan formation to continue into 2016. delinquencies over the past 12 to 18 months have largely been from troubled industries offshore, such as the commodity sector in indonesia, but we expect deterioration in banks domestic portfolios to emerge in 2016, it said. meanwhile, kenanga researchs analyst ahmad ramzani ramli also sees little catalysts to stimulate loan growth in 2016. so far, we have not seen any catalyst for 2016, unless the economy recovers. maybe if 2qfy16 and 3qfy16 economic data turn encouraging, then banks may have more confidence to approve loans, he noted. nonetheless, it is not all dark and gloomy to ahmad ramzani, who noted that with the stringent loan approval since 2014, malaysian banks may now have a better-quality loan portfolio. if their quality of loans gets better, it may give room to banks to be less stringent in terms of loan approval, he said. however, an analyst, who declined to be named, said 2016 will be the time to reflect on banks loan quality, particular those that were approved before the abolishment of the developer interest bearing scheme (dibs). this is the time to test those loans approved during the dibs period, because some of these loans may have been taken for the purpose of leveraging. we will see now if they really have the strength to repay these loans, she said. despite the fact that there are little upside catalysts for the banking sector, ahmad ramzani said he would still choose malayan banking bhd (maybank) as his stock pick, mainly due to the groups asean exposure and attractive dividend yield. maybank has a balanced exposure to the region, and with a dividend yield of about 7%, pe (price-to-earnings ratio) of 1.3 times compared with the industrys average of 1.5 times, i think it is a good deal, he said. pong concurred, adding that on top of its valuation, maybank has demonstrated robust profit growth in the past. for 3qfy15, maybank posted a net profit of rm1.9 billion, up 18.1% year-on-year from rm1.61 billion, while net interest income came in at rm2.9 billion, 17.7% higher from rm2.46 billion seen in 3qfy14. however, maybank investment bank research analyst desmond chng is more attracted to banks that possess liquid balance sheets. our preference would be for banks with liquid balance sheets to better withstand price competition, thus our buy calls are on afg (alliance financial group bhd), bimb (bimb holdings bhd) and hong leong bank bhd/hong leong financial group bhd, that have net ldrs of 85%, 81% and 80% respectively, as at end-sept 2015, he said. in his research report dated dec 3, chng also mentioned that banks return on equity are expected to compress further."}, "233": {"date_posted": "17/12/2015", "title": "klci up 1.4% on us rate lift-off", "article": " kuala lumpur (dec 17): the fbm klci gained 22.39 points or 1.4%, tracking regional shares following the us federal reserve (fed)'s move to raise interest rates. at 5pm, the klci closed at 1,656.52 points. across asia, japan's nikkei 225 rose 1.59% while hong kong's hang seng and south korea's kospi gained 0.79% and 0.43% respectively. \"the factor behind the (klci's) rise is mainly the us fed funds rate hike. the region is also up due to the hike. partially, the local market is up also due to possibly some window-dressing activities here,\" maybank investment bank bhd regional chartist lee cheng hooi told theedgemarkets.com. reuters reported that the fed's 25-basis-point increase was almost a decade in the making and easily one of the most telegraphed in history. so there was some relief that, after months of waiting and several false starts, the move was finally done and dusted. asian stock markets jumped on thursday as investors chose to take the historic hike in us interest rates as a mark of confidence in the world's largest economy, lifting the dollar and piling on the pain for oil prices. in malaysia, bursa malaysia saw 1.95 billion shares worth rm2.25 billion traded. the bourse's 594 gainers outnumbered the 298 decliners. british american tobacco (m) bhd headed gainers while leading decliners included ajinomoto (m) bhd and petronas dagangan bhd. the top active stock was xox bhd. in currency markets, the ringgit erased losses against the us dollar to trade at 4.3130 at 5pm. the ringgit had earlier today weakened to 4.3380 versus the us dollar on news of the us rate hike.

or 9.71 sen per share from rm352.7 million or 9.49 sen per share in the previous year. the better earnings was underpinned by higher adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda), contributed mainly by higher net forex gains. a reversal of rm186.4 million in respect of previously recognised impairment losses, mainly in respect of the uk casino licences also contributed to the better net income although this was partially offset by higher net fair value loss on derivative financial instruments, impairment losses and deferred expenses written off in respect of the bimini operations. 3qfy15's revenue was 3.56% higher at rm4.65 billion from rm4.49 billion underpinned by the better performance from its power segment. for the cumulative nine months

year even though revenue fell 9% to rm2.03 billion from rm2.23 billion previously. the better net income was due to the absence of impairment losses during the quarter under review, lower pre-operating expenses offset by deferred expenses written off and higher depreciation and amortisation charges. the lower revenue was attributed to the 60% drop in turnover generated from its uk business to rm268.7 million in 3qfy15 from rm674.7 million in the previous year. for the nine-month period (9mfy15), genm's net profit gained 4.6% to rm919.32 million or 16.22 sen per share from rm878.84 million or 15.5 sen per share a year earlier, while revenue slipped 1.13% to rm6.1 billion from rm6.17 billion in 9mfy14. both of the groups did not declare dividend for the quarter under

kuala lumpur: malayan banking bhds (maybank) conventional insurance arm etiqa insurance bhd is aiming to grow its revenue by 10% next year and anticipates a big portion of that growth to be driven by its life insurance business.  in an interview with the edge financial daily, etiqa insurance chief executive officer zaharudin daud expects both life and general insurance segments to register single-digit revenue growth in 2016. we are looking at growth of about 10% growth in top line in 2016. the bigger portion of the growth is expected to be contributed by our life business. life insurance is expected to grow by about 5%, while the general insurance business is expected to grow between 6% and 8% in revenue next year, he said. currently, general insurance contributes to 52% of its revenue, while life insurance contributes the balance 48%, said zaharudin. for the life insurance segment, he said etiqa insurance will be focusing more on regular premium insurance, which provides better new business margin, to improve its profits. when it comes to life insurance, there are two main types of premiums  the single and the regular premium. we are fairly sizeable in our single premium, but in terms of margins and sustainability, it is not as healthy as the regular premium. for general insurance, he said the company aims to increase its net retention premium and will also concentrate on well-spread, but smaller, risk insurance, such as personal accident (pa) insurance. he explained that for pa, the issuances are very small, thus removing the need for reinsurance; he also noted that the loss ratio for the product is very good. he added that this strategy will leverage on its bancassurance model with maybank. the key is in how we are delivering the product. we are fortunate as we are a part of the maybank group. we have our kiosks located at close to 450 maybank outlets nationwide. imagine over 400 branches selling at least three pa products a day. at an average premium of rm300 to rm400 [per day/per product/per week], we can easily get over rm6 million per month. the loss ratio for pa is also very good, [the] maximum is at around 25%, he said, adding that etiqa insurance aims to take the lead in the pa market. however, in the companys latest unaudited results for the six months ended june 30, 2015, etiqa insurance saw its net profit fall 32% to rm121.28 million from rm179.61 million in the same period last year, as revenue fell 6% to rm1.68 billion from rm1.78 billion. zaharudin said etiqa insurance faces a tough operating environment in 2015, along with the rest of the malaysian insurance industry. i think everybody is quite familiar with the current economic situation. the investment market is not doing very well, so it has an impact on our business. etiqa insurance is not the only one affected, he said. domestically, he said people have been more cautious since the implementation of the goods and services tax (gst) in april. with the unfavourable market and gst coming into play in the same year, people are a bit cautious and very selective in their insurance purchases, he said, adding that etiqa insurance is expecting lower investment returns in 2015. meanwhile, the group will continue investing in its online insurance business, which has grown exponentially, reporting sales of rm73 million in 2014, compared with rm16.2 million in 2010, added zaharudin. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the

quiet range of 33.07 points for the week, with higher volumes of 1.92 billion to 3.43 billion shares traded. the index closed at 1,660.06 yesterday, up 3.56 points from the previous days close as blue-chip stocks like cimb group holdings bhd, hong leong bank bhd, malayan banking bhd, ppb group bhd and petronas dagangan bhd caused the index to inch up on minor nibbling activities. the ringgit was marginally firmer against the us dollar at 4.3390 as brent crude turned weaker to us$42.20 (rm183.15) per barrel. the index rose on a rally from a 801.27 low (october 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014), and this represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements after july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,837.28 (low), 1,879.62 (high), 1,766.22 (low), 1,858.09 (high), 1,671.82 (low), 1,810.21 (high), 1,706.18 (low), 1,831.41 (high), 1,774.30 (low), 1,867.53 (high), 1,685.03 (low), 1,744.19 (high),

stochastic indicator remains only marginally positive for now. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at 1,567, 1,595 and 1,644, while heavy liquidation in the resistance areas of 1,660, 1,696 and 1,727 would cap any index advances. the klcis 18-day and 40-day simple moving averages (smas) depict an emerging downtrend for its short-term daily chart. the indexs price bars are also now below the 50-day and 200-day smas, and this depicts a softer phase for the klci in the medium term. despite the benign tone of the klci, we are recommending a chart buy on public packages holdings bhd (pphb). a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that only one research house covers the stock, with a buy call. pphb is in the packaging business. the company manufactures and retails corrugated cartons, packing materials, offset printed display boxes, gift and display boxes, and paper products. the companys sales revenue and net income have increased steadily over the past three years. its current price-earnings ratio and price-booking ratio stand at extremely low and very attractive levels of 8.9 times and 0.71 times respectively. its return on equity stands at 8.3%, while the one-year growth for earning per share was recorded at 21.5%. there was no significant news on the stock recently.  pphbs chart trend in the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly up. its share price has made an obvious surge since its major monthly wave-2 low of 13 sen on july 2009. since that 13 sen low, pphb rose to its recent high of rm1.13 this month. as the share price broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of 90 sen and rm1.04, look to buy pphb on any dips into its support areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term uptrend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) have issued clear buy signals, and now show firm and obvious indications of pphbs eventual surge towards higher levels. it would attract firm buying activities at the support levels of 90 sen, rm1.04 and rm1.06. we expect pphb to witness minor profit-taking at the resistance levels of rm1.13, rm1.23 and rm1.49.

2015.  the slowdown in the real estate market does not seem to have deterred property-related companies from buying more land. this could be due to the belief that as land is scarce, they should move fast if an opportunity arises. last week alone, two companies, namely wct holdings bhd and ioi properties group bhd, announced proposed land acquisitions. both are not cash deals. wct is buying a small parcel right in the city centre, in tun razak exchange, for rm223 million, while ioi prop is acquiring 400 acres in sepang from its controlling shareholders for rm2.03 billion. the way wct (fundamental:0.45, valuation:1.40) and the vendor, 1mdb real estate sdn bhd, have structured the land deal is unique. wct was awarded a rm754.8 million contract to build infrastructure in trx, and part of the payment for the construction work will be used to offset the land purchase. in short, wct is getting a trx job and buying trx land. wcts share price has been volatile since it announced the infrastructure job and land purchase on oct 19, hovering within a 2% band. it jumped 3.65% on the day the deal was announced, but declined 2.1% the next day. over at ioi prop, its share price rose 7.1% to end the week at rm2.29  its highest level this year. in general, wcts deals are viewed positively, but anything that has to do with 1mdb brings a negative connotation. the market does not seem to like it that wct is involved in the development of trx. some even think the price is expensive, says an analyst. to recap, the contract sum, amounting to rm754.8 million, is to be paid over three milestone payments based on the work done at trx. the job starts on oct 21 and is to be completed no later than 687 calendar days from the commencement date. at the same time, wct entered into a sale and purchase agreement (spa) with klifd sdn bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of 1mdb real estate. wcts purchase of a 1.65-acre plot of development land within trx for rm223 million translates into rm3,098 per sq ft, which is lower than the rm4,683 psf paid by affin bank bhd for 1.25 acres in trx in august, but higher than the rm2,736 psf paid by pilgrim fund lembaga tabung haji for 1.58 acres in may. wct plans to build high-end serviced apartments on the land with an estimated gross development value of rm1.1 billion. the land comes with an allowable plot ratio of 10.8 times with a maximum permissible gross floor area (gfa) of 755,002 sq ft. maybank investment banks chai li shin forecasts a net profit contribution of rm45.9 million, or 3.7 sen per share, from the construction contract by 2017. tan siang hing, an analyst with public investment bank, says while the price paid on a gfa basis of rm288 seems fair, given the current market conditions, the project wct is planning might take a while to monetise. however, there are concerns that wcts gearing will increase and the cash flow from the construction contract might not be enough to reduce debts significantly. wct will just receive 70% of the contract value, as the other 30% will be set off against the price of the land. the groups net gearing was 0.8 times as at june 30. wct had rm594.3 million in cash balances during the period against total debts of rm2.45 billion. wct is expecting a rm1.2 billion award from the arbitration case it won in july against meydan group llc of dubai for the termination of the nad al sheba racecourse project. but analysts do not expect the group to receive the sum soon. investors also do not seem to be convinced about wcts expectation of getting the arbitration award. wct expects to receive the award payment within three years, but payment from arbitration cases is hardly predictable. its share price performance seems to show that investors have not yet factored in the rm1.2 billion award, says an analyst. for ioi prop, the related-party transaction seems to have gone down well with the investing fraternity as some quarters believe the purchase of more land in sepang would improves ioi resort citys earnings prospect as it would complement the existing development. more importantly, the transaction price is considered fair. the acquisition will enlarge the development to 449.7 acres, with an estimated gdv of rm20 billion. ioi prop (fundamental: 1.95 , valuation: 1.80) agreed to acquire mayang development sdn bhd from tan sri lee shin cheng and puan seri hoong may kuan, and nusa properties sdn bhd from them and datuk lee yeow chor for a total consideration of rm2.03 billion. only 10% of the total consideration will be paid via cash, with the remainder to be settled via the issuance of new ioi prop shares to the vendors. the acquisition price translates into rm117 psf, compared with the range of rm120 to rm150 psf in putrajaya and cyberjaya, according to jason tan, an analyst with hong leong investment bank. however, analysts do not expect massive shareholding dilution. upon the completion of the deal, lees shareholding would increase to 58.56% through the issue of shares. thus, this would not affect the property groups gearing ratio, which would inch up to 0.1 times from 0.07 times. balance sheet remains solid with net gearing only expected to increase slightly from 0.07 times to 0.1 times, providing room for future land bank acquisition. we estimate the acquisition to increase rnav by 17%, offsetting the 17% dilution in enlarged share base, tan states in his report. we believe this is a synergistic acquisition as it will expand ioi props landbank in ioi resort city from the existing 50 acres to 450 acres and complement the existing development. in addition, this also provides an opportunity for ioi prop to embark on the second phase of ioi city mall, says tan. note: the edge researchs fundamental score

selloff in the local bourse, the fbm klci is down 7.2% year to date, we remain cautious on the outlook going forward. there is no broad-based bargain to be had as the price declines merely reflect weaker corporate earnings rather than a drop in valuations. indeed, valuations for the broader market are still elevated. headwinds remain formidable, both domestic and external. we are bracing for further downward revisions to earnings, which will, in turn, keep a lid on any material and sustainable rebound. as such, it is prudent to stay on the defensive and adopt a very selective stance in stock picking. our income portfolio is modelled to be fully invested at all times. hence, cashing out is not an option. that said, we are confident that our basket of stocks will continue to hold up comparatively well. dividends are boring but provide a steady income stream. in times of uncertainties, cash is king. most of the companies in our portfolio have strong balance sheets and are sitting on cash, which should sustain their higher-than-market average yields, even if short-term earnings fall short. and corporate earnings, broadly speaking, will fall short. earnings results have come in below market expectations for consecutive quarters over the past few years. while there are those that believe in a recovery in 2h2015, we are far less sanguine. in fact, we suspect the malaise will continue for the next few quarters, at least.  no quick rebound on the external front, the global economy is not going to see a quick rebound. of the developed world, only the us is showing signs of a strengthening recovery. emerging markets, on the other hand, are looking at a long period of adjustment ahead. much of the global growth in the past decade has been driven by china and its voracious demand for all things ranging from commodities to capital and consumer goods. the strong demand for commodities, in particular, has underpinned growth in export-dependent emerging countries. but chinas period of rapid growth has, very likely, come to an end. the country is in the midst of transitioning from an economy that is driven by export and industrial to one that is based on services and consumption. hence, the unfolding slowdown in the worlds second largest economy is structural in nature, not cyclical. it is not all doom and gloom. china still has ample ammunition in its arsenal, in terms of fiscal and monetary stimulus, to engineer a soft landing. the recent easing of monetary policy should start to have an impact soon. indeed, the latest reading on factory activities shows stabilisation, though one point never does a trend make. in the long run chinas transformation  into slower but more sustainable pace of growth  will be positive for the global economy. but it will take time. just as it will take time for the commodities markets to adjust to the new norm of lower demand. the pain is compounded by the fact that the commodities boom of the past decade and a half has attracted substantial investments that are now culminating in rising supply. the markets could take months, maybe even years for some commodities, to rebalance. hence, we believe outlook for emerging countries will be rough for the foreseeable future. fundamentals have deteriorated the local stock market selloff and steep fall in the ringgit are not purely sentiment driven. they reflect deterioration in our real economy under the confluence of negative external factors. malaysia is a very open economy and the slowdown in global trade will hurt, just as the sharp fall in crude oil and crude palm oil prices  two of our key exports  will negatively impact the countrys finances and growth potential. our weakened fundamentals coupled with imminent hike in us interest rates  which will very likely translate into capital outflows from emerging economies  will keep pressure on the ringgit. the environment for domestic economic growth is weak, with no clear driver. domestic consumption is hampered by a rising cost of living  the goods and services tax and higher import costs due to the weak ringgit  and high household indebtedness. as we have seen from the us experience, the recovery period is much longer when households have to deleverage and repair their balance sheets. there will be no debt-fuelled consumption binge to drive growth this time around. similarly, government spending is capped by a public debt level that is pushing at its self-imposed ceiling and a commitment to reduce the budget deficit. the target of achieving a balanced budget is already being pushed back due to falling revenue, which is still highly dependent on oil. this translates into limited scope for fiscal stimulus. much hope is placed on the export sector to dig us out of the rut. for the moment, though, exports are not seeing much benefit from the weak ringgit on the back of slower global demand and competitive devaluations. growing political uncertainty and aversion to risks, meanwhile, are putting dampeners on private investments. taking all of the above into consideration, it is hard to envision any broad-based improvements in corporate earnings in the near to medium term. indeed, the odds are for earnings to fall further, sandwiched between slowing demand and rising costs. and since earnings will ultimately drive stock prices, the prospect of a sustainable market recovery is poor.  income portfolio gains 6.9% in september the insiderasia income portfolio outperformed the market benchmark, fbm klci last month amid increased volatility. total

move?", "article": " this article first appeared in digitaledge weekly, on september 21 - 25, 2015.  news last week that aabar investments pjs voting rights in rhb capital bhd is capped at 15% took many by surprise and raises questions as to what aabars next move will be and whether the banking groups proposed rights issue to raise rm2.5 billion might be delayed. it could also put rhb (fundamental: 1.40; valuation: 1.65) back in the m&a spotlight, some analysts say. aabar currently has a 21.09% stake in rhb. it is understood that bankers working on the rights issue will be seeking clarification from bank negara malaysia about issues that arise following the latest development. this is something out of the ordinary, so the bankers will be seeking clarification to be absolutely certain on how best to approach the rights issue now. if need be, rhb may have to delay the timelines of the rights issue slightly, a source familiar with the matter tells digitaledge weekly. under the initial plan, the exercise was to have been completed by end-october. another source says there was communication between rhb and aabar last week, but that this was just a regular business update between rhbs management and the middle eastern investor. at that point, aabar had yet to indicate whether it would take up its entitlement of the rights issue. the revelation about the cap came about on sept 17 when rhb, in a stock exchange filing, said it had been informed by bank negara of the central banks order to aabar relating to the latters shareholding in rhb. the central bank, in a letter to rhb on sept 14, said it required rhb to give effect to the order prohibiting aabar from exercising its voting rights in respect of the shares held in rhb in excess of 15%. it also said rhb is prohibited from issuing any further shares to aabar in excess of a 15% shareholding, thus limiting aabars entitlement to the rights issue to not more than 15% of the issue. ultimately, what this means, is that regardless of aabars higher shareholding in rhb, it will only have a 15% voting right. it is unclear if this is a new development, or something that was imposed on aabar when it first emerged as a substantial shareholder in rhb back in 2011. the shareholding condition imposed by bank negara on aabar is in respect to the initial approval granted by the finance minister for aabar to acquire a 24.9% stake in rhbcap, rhb said in the stock exchange filing. the wording of the announcements suggests that this was already a precondition in the original agreement with aabar, says maybank ib research. investors will recall that aabar acquired its original 24.9% stake in rhb from its sister company abu dhabi commercial bank (adcb) back in june 2011 for rm10.80 a share. unlike adcb, which is a bank, aabar is a company and back then, bafia restricted corporate shareholding in banks to no more than 20% (the current financial services act, which superseded bafia in june 2013, is silent on this). as such, it is our assumption that it may have been a prerequisite for aabar to have pared down its shareholding within a specific time frame, which could have been five years, since aabar has just entered into its fifth year as a shareholder of rhb, its banking analyst desmond chng says in a sept 18 report. assuming aabar takes up 15% of its entitlement to the rights issue, its stake in rhb would fall to just over 20% from 21.09% currently. should the middle eastern investor decide not to take up the rights, its shareholding in rhb would drop to 17.5%. there is heavy dilution amid a rights price that is so heavily discounted versus book value, notes an industry observer. in 2008, adcb acquired a 25% stake in rhb for rm7.20 per share, valuing it at 2.2 times price to book. it then sold the stake to its sister company aabar in 2011, valuing it at 2.25 times book. rhbs current share price translates to an ex-rights price of rm6.12 versus aabars entry cost of rm10.80 per share, maybank ib research notes. the other major shareholders of rhb  the employees provident fund (epf) and osk holdings bhd  have committed to subscribe fully to their respective stakes of 41.58% and 9.97%. the balance would then be underwritten by a consortium of investment banks which includes rhb investment bank, affin hwang investment bank, cimb investment bank, credit suisse securities (malaysia) sdn bhd, maybank investment bank and public investment bank. moreover, it is the epfs intention to apply for excess rights of up to 2%, thus potentially mopping up part of the excess rights from aabars restricted stake, maybank ib says. with aabars voting rights capped at 15%, industry observers and banking analysts point out that this could potentially lead to fresh takeover attempts being made on rhb. i wouldnt be surprised if rhb gets back into the m&a spotlight as a target again. the stock price is at lows so a deal can still get done if its a stock deal, says an industry observer. however, given the current weak economic environment, companies have become more cautious about undertaking any m&a exercise. earlier this year, a proposed merger between rhb, cimb group holdings bhd and malaysia building society bhd fell through despite months of talks due to a number of reasons that included the worsening economic environment. it was no secret that during their talks for the potential mega merger, aabar  with its 21.2% stake in rhb then  was a potential stumbling block to the deal. this was given the fact that it had indicated it wanted at least rm12 per share in any deal  an asking price that was nearly 20% more than the rm10.03 per share that rhb was valued at in the proposed deal. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys

sees lending and transaction banking as major contributors to the revenue of its myanmar operations within the next five years. maybank international's chief executive officer pollie sim said lending will be driven mainly by working capital financing and transaction banking by myanmars growing international trade and demand for cash management, especially as projects are completed and operationalised. we believe that maybanks success in myanmar hinges on the growth of myanmars financial sector,\" she said in a statement today. \"to this end, we have been playing a significant role in supporting the development of the countrys financial services industry, ever since we began operating as a representative office here in 1994. we have hosted various training sessions for myanmar banks to share our knowledge in banking and finance and we will continue to do so, especially across four key areas - namely interbank and capital market, international trade and capability building, she added. sim said the group's focus will be supporting wholesale and corporate clients as well as domestic banks in myanmar, with services such as deposit accounts, working capital financing, transaction banking, cash management, treasury and capital market solutions. we are well positioned to bring our experience and industry expertise to the table to develop project financing structures, or help raise capital via regional equity or debt markets,\" she said. \"we will also be able to leverage our balance sheet and offshore financing capabilities to finance large scale projects and/ or distribute them across our network, sim added. sim noted that myanmar is a fast emerging nation with a target economic growth of 9.3% for 2015, driven by an unprecedented amount of foreign investment and rapid expansion in its nascent telecoms sector. myanmars economy has undergone a major transformation since 2012 and is now luring foreign direct investment (fdi) on a larger scale. for 2014/2015, the country received us$8.1 billion in fdi which was 25 times higher compared with the us$329.6 million received in 2009/2010, she noted. this will not only drive the consumer sector, but also demand for financial services, which in turn will be a major growth driver for the country. the maybank yangon branch, which has a registered capital of us$75 million, was recently officiated by the deputy governor of the central bank of myanmar, u set aung and deputy governor of bank negara malaysia, datuk muhammad ibrahim. maybank's chairman tan sri megat zaharuddin megat mohd nor said in his speech that maybank has been present in myanmar for the last 20 over years. he said the coming into force of the asean economic community (aec) at the end of this year is going to change the economic landscape in asia. with the harmonisation and integration of the flow of goods, services, people and capital, there will be plenty of opportunities across the region. we are also aseans top four in market values and assets among banking groups. these positions give us strengths to offer cross-border banking solutions and support our aim to become a financial solutions gateway for multinational clients from across our global network, including asean and greater china, which have business and investment dealings in myanmar, said megat zaharuddin.

[look at] aol and time warner. yahoo! hasnt performed well in the long run. there are new companies coming up, but you and i dont know whether the world will still be using facebook in five years. i mean they will use it, but to what extent will it make money and to what extent will it still grow? by then, everybody in the whole world would have a facebook [account] and to grow [further] would be more difficult. so, it is difficult to invest in technology. some industry experts say cash is king and recommend that investors hold large amounts of cash in volatile times. faber, however, advises against this strategy, saying that it is too risky to hold only cash.\nas an investor, there are recommendations to go 100% into cash, but i disagree with that notion to some extent. first of all, most people can sell shares, but to sell your house? it is illiquid. the other issue which comes up is if you sell everything and you are wrong, what then? i would be very reluctant as an investor to just hold cash. first of all, it will cost you, say, 5% minimum in transaction costs on all your assets. to buy again will cost you another 5% at least. instead, investors would do well to stay invested and diversified to ride out market volatility. one of the most important insights for an investor is to understand is that no matter how intelligent he is, he doesnt know what the world will look like in 5 or 10 years. he has to diversify, faber says. he has to own some real estate, some shares. he may hate bonds, but i think bonds will be better investments than us stocks or stocks [in general]. for diversification, i would hold some bonds, some cash overseas and also some precious metals, such as gold, silver and platinum. art is something investors should consider for their portfolio. if someone likes art, [he can consider it]. a lot of people have become very rich through art because they collect artists who have become very well known, he says. currently, there is a lot of speculation in the art market. but i would imagine that in many countries, there are many unknown artists. one day, they will have a chance to become famous. they dont have to be famous globally  just in their own markets. so, hold a portion in art, but be aware that you can also lose your art through theft.\n "}, "258": {"date_posted": "1/10/2015", "title": "klci up on plantation shares, better regional performance", "article": " kuala lumpur (oct 1): the fbm klci rose 12.89 points or 0.8% to 1,633.93, attributed to positive regional market performance on china economic data. this followed an overnight rise in us markets. at 5pm, the klci rose on gains in plantation stocks like kuala lumpur kepong bhd and sime darby bhd, both of which ended among bursa malaysia top gainers. oil palm plantation firms were seen gaining from a weaker ringgit and lower output, both of which were expected to bode well for crude palm oil prices. across asia, japan's nikkei 225 rose about 2% while south korea's kospi was up 0.84%. china markets are closed from today (oct 1) until next wednesday (oct 7) for national holidays. in malaysia, maybank investment bank regional chartist lee cheng hooi said the klci's performance was \"mainly due to a better regional market performance\". \"overnight, the us markets rose after the adp research institute survey that showed private employers added 200,000 jobs in september, ahead of the us jobs report for september this friday,\" lee told theedgemarkets.com. china was closely watched today. reuters reported that the announcement of china's manufacturing purchasing managers' index (pmi) was not as bad as some had feared, although it still showed contraction for the second straight month. it was reported that china's official pmi rose to 49.8 in september from the previous month's 49.7. in malaysia, bursa malaysia ended the day with 1.52 billion shares valued at rm1.82 billion traded. gainers outweighed decliners at 465 against 306. major decliners included united plantations bhd and allianz malaysia bhd the most-actively traded stock was aemulus holdings bhd with 84.21 million shares traded.

valuation: 1.5) made a record net profit of rm49 million, on revenue of rm170 million. it is worth noting that despite strong revenue growth of 60% and profit growth of 100% last year, the companys long-term target looks a long way off. to recap, vitrox had targeted revenue of rm500 million by 2017 or 2018, a workforce of 500, and market capitalisation of rm1 billion, from rm676.9 million currently. chu reiterates that vitrox is maintaining its long-term target of achieving rm900 million in revenue by 2020, and a market cap of as high as rm2 billion, based on a price-earnings ratio of 10 times. at an average profit margin of 25%, the group should generate annual net profit of more than rm200 million by 2020. i am very optimistic about the long-term prospects for vitrox as there will be more devices connected to the internet, coupled with the explosion of big data, whereby more semiconductor chips and automation will be needed around the world. i strongly believe we are moving in the right direction to become a global technology company in the next 10 years, he says. vitrox is the countrys largest solution provider of automated vision inspection systems and equipment. it has three major business segments, namely automated board inspection (abi), machine vision solution (mvs) and electronics communication system (ecs). its products are used in the semiconductor, automotive, telecommunications and electronics packaging industries to detect defects during the manufacturing process. chu is the co-founder and single largest shareholder with a 28.2% stake, followed by senior vice-president steven siaw kok tong and executive director yeoh shih hoong with 20% and 10.7%, respectively. going forward, chu says vitrox aims to improve its profit margin through effective internal cost control, promoting higher value products, and taking advantage of the appreciation of the us dollar. vitrox remains a prime beneficiary of the stronger us dollar as 80% of its sales are denominated in the greenback, compared to only 30% of its raw materials. in an aug 10 report, maybank investment bank bhd analyst ivan yap says a sensitivity analysis suggests that every 1% change in forex will impact vitroxs bottom line by 2%. in another note on aug 24, he says despite a weaker-than-expected outlook in 2015, he remains positive on vitroxs longer-term earnings growth prospects. lower unit sales were bolstered by higher average selling prices as we assume 3.85 per dollar average from 3.60 per dollar previously, he says. yap maintains a buy on the stock, with a slightly lower target price of rm3.65, transalating into an upside potential of 28.98% at its closing price of rm2.83 last friday. chu says the forex gain is a bonus for vitrox, but is only a temporary advantage because it has no control over currency trends. we would rather pay more attention to expanding our product range and customer base to mitigate the market volatility, he says. vitrox will continue to strengthen its presence in china, america, europe, india and southeast asia through its internal sales force and sales channel partners, he adds. vitrox share price has retraced 25.7% in the last four months from its all-time high of rm3.81 on april 21. the counter is currently trading at a historical price-earnings ratio (per) of 13.8 times. at its peak, the stocks per was as high as 18.1 times. to me, the current share price of vitrox is very attractive. our shares have been undervalued says chu, pointing out that the stock is trading at a lower per against its peers. globetronics technology bhd (fundamental: 3;

valuation: 2), which has seen its share price gain 48% year to date, has the lowest per of 12.3 times. chu says the market conditions may change but the groups direction remains firm. if you had invested in vitrox five years ago, you would have seen our share price grow more than five times from below 50 sen to rm3.  \nthis article first appeared in digitaledge weekly, on september 7 - 13, 2015."}, "262": {"date_posted": "22/9/2015", "title": "iris sees better fy16 results amid weaker ringgit -md", "article": " kuala lumpur (sept 22): iris corp bhd stands to gain from the weaker ringgit, as the electronic-identification specialist capitalises on its global business. iris' group managing director datuk tan say jim said the company's sales were denominated in the us dollar and euro. \"every 10% increase in the value of foreign currencies (against the ringgit) contributes to iris' bottomline.\n\n\"our exports are either in us dollars or euros, so it is obviously good for us. for our trusted-identification division, more than 50% of our revenue is from exports,\" he told reporters, after the company's annual general meeting (agm). compared to the us dollar, the ringgit has weakened to 4.2915 today, from its strongest level at 3.2230 over the last one year, according to bloomberg data. the ringgit has also depreciated against the euro at 4.8028 versus the strongest point at 3.8567. iris is also a property developer and renewable-energy entity. tan said iris expected to perform better in financial year ending march 31, 2016, underpinned by its property development in papua new guinea, electronic-identification division and waste-to-energy incinerator in phuket, thailand. in papua new guinea, tan said construction of the 290 landed villas would begin in the second half of fy16. the rm300 million project is expected to be completed within fy16, according to him. \"we launched the housing project last year, but we have not started any building because we needed to get the financing in place and that has been put in place already. maybank gave us a usd20 million (rm85.83 million) facility,\" said. in malaysia, tan said iris submitted its tender for an affordable housing project in putrajaya. \"we should be able to get news on the tender within two months,\" he said. iris' renewable energy project in thailand is closely watched. tan said the waste-to-energy plant in phuket would continue to contribute to the company's earnings in fy16. today, iris shares settled unchanged at 12:30pm at 20 sen, for a market capitalisation of rm408.1 million. the share price compares to the company's latest reported net assets per share of 27 sen.

the low jet fuel prices and the budget airlines plans to turn around its indonesian and philippine units as among the key catalysts of the stock. airasia (fundamental: 0.2; valuation: 1.2) shares

interest, gaining one sen or 4.76% to close at 22 sen. airasia shares started sliding in june after hong kong-based gmt research issued a report that questioned the low-cost carriers books. this was further pulled down by concerns regarding its indonesian affiliate in july, after the indonesian authority warned that pt indonesia airasia could be grounded for a lack of funds. year-to-date, airasia has shed rm3.73 billion or 49.26% from rm7.57 billion on dec 31, 2014 to rm3.84 billion yesterday, underperforming the fbm klcis 6.91% decline. however, investors have started to turn bullish on the stock, with 24 research firms predicting a 29.95% upside based on the average target price of rm1.97 apiece, according to bloomberg data. i think the excessive sell-off [of airasia shares] is over and its recent recovery is within the markets expectation, ta securities research analyst tan kam meng told the edge financial daily over the phone, adding that the stock should gradually recover to its fundamental value. he also noted airasias foreign shareholdings dropped to 48% as at end of august compared with 60% a year ago, mainly due to the decline in the ringgit against the us dollar. tan is of the view that the foreign shareholdings are unlikely to decrease further based on the current us dollar/ringgit exchange rate. yesterday, the ringgit weakened by 1.8% to close at 4.2720 against the greenback. tan is reiterating a buy call on airasia with a target price of rm1.68, expecting the airlines fundamentals to be stronger than before, underpinned by lower fuel price and lessening competition. as such, we see the current price weakness as a good opportunity to accumulate [airasia shares], he added. maybank investment bank bhd aviation analyst mohshin aziz also sees further upside in airasias share price, given that the airline has good earnings potential going ahead. i think the share price decline over the past months was overdone and has been priced in. the market is now looking at the positive side of things, he told the edge financial daily.  we are confident that the outlook for the second half of 2015 and 2016 is positive, given the low fuel price environment and the fact that malaysia airlines bhd (mab) has cut significant capacity and raised its published fares significantly since august, said mohshin. further, the airlines proposed share buyback announcement last week is positive on the sentiment, he added. he is keeping his earnings forecasts and fair value of rm2.05 unchanged, which is based on 8 times airasias fy15 price-earnings ratio (per). publicinvest said airasia is trading at a compelling per of 4.3 times fy16 earnings, which is at its lowest four-year historical per. this compared to its historical per of 10 times. we continue to like airasia for its solid long-term potential growth prospects, low-cost competitive advantage and network connectivity and synergies within the airasia group, the firm added. kenanga research analyst adrian ng believes that the price recovery will be sustainable for airasia, should the yields be maintained at current levels and it benefits from lower jet fuel costs. kenanga

mphbs status has been the same and it is in no rush to change that, an analyst tells digitaledge weekly. mphb (fundamental: 1.90; valuation: 2.10) has not paid any dividends since fy2013. that was the year bank negara malaysia rejected the companys proposal to reward shareholders with a final dividend per share of five sen. mphb disappointed shareholders yet again with no dividend payout in fy2014. this was despite its coffers being enriched by an extraordinary net gain of rm195 million from the sale of a piece of land in balik pulau, penang, taking its cash balance to rm481.42 million as at end-fy2014. in a march 6 circular, the company indicated that rm338.2 million from the mpi deal will be invested in viable businesses or assets to be identified. so far, no progress has been made on that front and shareholders are uncertain about what the extra funds will be used for. much of mphbs inability to reward shareholders is blamed on its need to meet capital adequacy requirements as a financial holding company under the financial services act  a factor that will remain in play until mphb pares down its stake in mpi and becomes a minority shareholder. this can happen if generali asia exercises a call option to up its shareholding in mpi to 70% in the next two years, subject to bank negaras approval. in a may 22 note, uob kay hian says it expects this to happen in 2h2015 and collect another rm160 million to rm170 million for mphb. but if bank negara disallows the exercise of the call option, generali asia is likely to exercise its put option to dispose of its entire stake in mpi within five years. this means that when it comes to dividend payout, shareholders will still have to play a wait-and-see game. the fact that mphb has not paid dividends in the last two years speaks for itself. this is not necessarily within the companys control but it is difficult to tell when the situation will change, says the analyst. with regard to its rich assets, mphb owns over 2,400 acres of prime land in kuala lumpur, penang and johor and had investment assets with a net book value of rm774 million and market value in excess of that as at dec 31, 2014. but realising some of its standout assets has been a slow process. while the redevelopment of hotel flamingo in ampang has been postponed due to unfavourable market conditions, the company is embroiled in a long-drawn-out civil suit against the government on the compulsory acquisition of 2,841 acres in pengerang in 2012 and another civil suit on the purchase of a 72,161 sq ft freehold parcel in bukit bintang. that aside, mphb is in a joint venture (jv) with bandar raya developments bhd (brdb) to develop residential projects in rawang, gombak and penang. the company is entitled to 22% of the development profits but does not bear any construction risk. the jv projects, first entered into in 2011, are now active. a residential project called taman sari in rawang with a gross development value of rm1.8 billion has just been launched. the development of its penang tract (gdv: rm900 million) should follow, although it is facing some challenges in developing its gombak land because of hilly terrain. still, none of the above has brought shareholders and investors closer to mphbs pot of gold. in fact, patience is wearing thin  the stock has lost 24 sen or 11.76% since the start of the year. maybank research has a hold call on the stock and a target price of rm1.90 while uob kay hian has an upgraded buy call on it and a target price of rm2.50. when asked if now is a good time to accumulate the stock, the analyst says, it depends. how long can you wait?

1,601 levels, while very heavy selling at the resistance areas of 1,606, 1,624 and 1,685 may cap any index rebound. the medium-term downside targets for the index are now located at 1,448 and 1,414. the fbm klcis 18-day and 40-day simple moving averages (sma) depict a clear downtrend for its short-term daily chart whilst the 50-day and 200-day sma have also intersected with a death cross as well. therefore, this will not augur well for the index in the short to longer term. furthermore, the fbm klci had broken a very critical neckline support of a major head and shoulder pattern on aug 10, 2015. the implied target of such a breakdown pitches the medium-term downside target at 1,448 despite its current minor rebound phase that began on tuesday. due to the rebound tone for the fbm klci index, we are recommending a chart buy on lii hen industries bhd (lii hen). a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that no research house has covered the stock. lii hen currently trades at a low historical price-earnings ratio of 9.77 times. its price-to-book value ratio of 3.32 times indicates that its share price is trading at a major premium to its book value. lii hens chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frame is very firmly up. its share price made a fantastic surge since its major weekly wave-2 low of rm1.11 in august 2013. since that rm1.11 low, lii hen surged to its august 2015 recent all-time high of rm6.10. as prices broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of rm4.80 and rm5.36, look to buy lii hen on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term uptrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, oscillator and stochastic) have issued firm buy signals and now depict very firm indications of lii hens eventual surge towards much higher levels. it would attract firm buying activities at the support levels of rm4.80, rm5.36 and rm6.09. we expect lii hen to witness some profit-taking at its resistance area and all-time high of rm6.10. its upside targets are located at rm6.30, rm7.30, rm7.80 and rm8.71. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank

revenues and cut costs and become one of the world's biggest agribusiness companies, it said in a statement. the plant can crush 1.05 million tonnes of canola and soybeans annually, producing vegetable oil for food and industrial markets and meal for livestock feed. viterra already operates a canola crushing plant in western canada, at ste. agathe, manitoba. green packet bhd returned to the black with a net profit of rm24.38 million for the three months ended june 30, 2015, from a net loss of rm50.32 million in the previous corresponding period. revenue was also higher by 8.2% to rm78.4 million, from rm72.4 million a year ago. according to its chief executive officer kay tan, the positive progress made in its operational business pillars (solutions and communications businesses) was attributable to the groups effective marketing strategy. for the 12 months period ended june 30, 2015 (fy15), the 4g network operator and services provider posted a net profit of rm56.38 million, on revenue of rm339.14 million. there was no comparative year-on-year figures, as its fy14 financial accounts were prepared for a period of 18 months ended june 30, 2014.

dropped 50% year to date. but fundamentally, the low-cost carrier (lcc) remains promising, and many analysts covering the stock say it is time to buy. in a report last week, maybank investment bank research reiterates its buy call on airasia (fundamental: 0.20; valuation: 1.40) and advises its clients to buy ahead of the release of the companys results for the second quarter ended june 30, 2015 (2qfy2015). however, it lowered its target price to rm2.32 from rm2.45. the research house has forecast air-asias 2qfy2015 core net profit to grow 629% year on year and 69% quarter on quarter to rm185.1 million, which will be the best second-quarter performance on record. fuel prices have been trending lower than expected. this will lift first-half financial year ending dec 31, 2015 (1hfy2015) core net profit to rm294.9 million, representing 94% growth y-o-y and meeting 41% of our full-year forecast and 46% of consensus, writes maybank ib analyst mohshin aziz. he also says the first half is a seasonally weaker period compared with the second half, with an approximate 40:60 split. maybank ib also made revisions to its fuel and us dollar-to-ringgit assumptions by imputing the ringgit to trade at 3.6597 against the greenback and the jet fuel price to average at us$81.80 per barrel. airasia is the cheapest lcc in the world today and is our top pick for the region. i say it is a good time to accumulate its shares, mohshin tells digitaledge weekly. earnings will be stronger as jet fuel prices get lower, not to mention the reforms at malaysian airline system bhd (mas) will take care of most of the problems the sector is facing now. mas is cutting unprofitable routes starting this month, meaning a slash in industry capacity, which will free up a large slice of the pie for the other players  airasia and malindo airways sdn bhd (see table for route cuts and capacity comparison). after august, the sectors landscape will change, mohshin says, adding that ticket prices already seem to be on the rise from september onwards, although it is too early to quantify the impact. airasias shares began their slippery slide after the disappearance of indonesia air- asias flight qz8501  which was flying from surabaya, indonesia, to singapore on dec 28, 2014  falling over 15% from rm2.90 in less than a week. it was later found that the plane had crashed into the java sea, killing all 162 passengers and crew. the stock did not recover, and by april, it was trading around the rm2.30 level. june dealt a double whammy as foreign research outfit gmt research highlighted weaknesses in airasias financial reporting and in indonesia, the ministry of transport threatened to suspend its operating licence. airasias share price has fallen 39% since june 1. it closed at rm1.34 on aug 7. indonesias ministry of transport had found 13 airlines operating there, including airasias loss-making pt indonesia air- asia (iaa), to be in negative equity territory (when the value of an asset used to secure a loan falls below the outstanding balance of the loan). it said their licences would be suspended if they were not in positive territory by end-july. later, it said it would help the ailing airlines meet the deadline and invited them to present their business plans. analysts do not believe airasia is at any significant risk of losing its indonesian operating licence. the indonesian ministry seems to be taking a more reasonable approach by helping the operators meet their equity requirements, says an analyst with a local research house. revoking airasias licence will be detrimental to the indonesian economy, so i think they will look for a win-win solution. iaa is said to employ over 2,000 workers, not accounting for the support employment like taxi drivers and cleaning staff. while this risk does not seem imminent, iaa will still have to remedy its negative equity position by end-september. airasia plans to raise funds via pre-initial public offerings for iaa and its philippine unit philippine airasia (paa). the ipos are slated for 2017. the group also plans to raise share capital through its local partners to us$100 million each for iaa and paa from us$14 million and us$13 million respectively. then, it will rope in new investors for each unit to inject at least us$100 million via the sale of convertible bonds. but one analyst points out that if they are unable to raise the funds at the associate level, airasia will have to step in and that will drag the whole group financially. this would mean a potential downgrade, he says. it also might not be easy to find investors because iaa and paa seem high risk now, with no track record. at an interest rate of 3% to 4%, that might not be worth the risk, he adds. as it is, airasia has come under fire from gmt research for the way it has classified debts owed by its associates. airasia is extending significant capital to them, essentially gearing up, funding its own profits and flattering its operating cash flows, the research house claimed. as at its first quarter ended march 31, 2015, airasia had a total of rm2.8 billion due from its associates sitting in its balance sheet. it has classified rm2.4 billion of this amount as non-current. the group plans to recover some rm1 billion following the twin fundraising exercises for iaa and paa, but in a worst-case scenario, it might have to prepare for impairment of those debts. we are wary of a possible impairment charge if the fundraising exercises fail. net gearing could spike to 4.4 times in fy2015, assuming rm2 billion in impairment charge, alliance research says in a july 15 note. the research house has one of the more conservative stances among analysts covering airasia, with a hold recommendation and a target price of rm1.55, indicating a 15% upside. midf research also revised downwards its target price to rm1.82 (35% upside) from rm3.70, but maintained its buy call. on the higher end of the spectrum, hong leong investment bank (hlib) research has a target price of rm3.11 (130% upside) on the stock while ta securities target price is rm2.62 (94% upside) and amresearchs, rm2.60 (92.5% upside). all three say investors should buy. the real wild card may be the way consumer sentiment in the aviation sector pans out. consumers are still wary about flying in general and the concerns they have are ongoing, says hlib research analyst daniel wong, citing the recent earthquake in sabah, which closely followed volcanic activity in bali and lombok, indonesia. this was an added blow after the triple airplane tragedies that befell malaysian airlines last year. at this point, there is a risk discount on the stock (airasia), and i think it is warranted at the current share price. unfortunately, investor sentiment doesnt look good, and until the companys earnings pick up and are able to show some consistency, the share price may not perform, says wong.  note: the

airline by hong kong-based gmt research. will the stock fall further after the embargo on the report is lifted and it becomes publicly available on june 24? so far, the report  entitled sell: new dog, old tricks, published on june 10  has only been circulated to gmts clients. industry sources who have seen the report say it makes some serious allegations about the companys financial health  that airasia (fundamental: 0.2; valuation: 1.4) boosted profits by 39% through related-party transactions, a practice that is no longer sustainable and is putting the airline at risk of default. the allegations and resulting slump in share price led founder and group ceo tan sri tony fernandes to hold several conference calls with analysts and fund managers to ease fears. consequently, local analysts have brushed off gmts report, stating that none of the problems highlighted are new. its not our policy to comment on other peoples report, so i leave you to it. but lets just say there was nothing new, nor anything groundbreaking that i and the rest of the analyst community havent raised already, writes mohshin aziz, a long-time aviation analyst and an associate director at maybank kim eng securities. mohshin maintains his buy call on airasia with a target price of rm2.45. we believe this episode will blow over rather quickly. be brave and accumulate for a profitable trade, he says. in contrast, gmts report is said to have valued airasia at rm1.23, and advised clients to sell the stock or, better yet, short sell the stock. gmts main grouse with airasia was the companys extraction of resources from its associates, which it alleges, are insolvent as well. as a result, gmt claims that airasias operating cash flow, without the support from its associates, had essentially fallen to zero by last year. while the report does not really show how gmt arrived at this figure, it highlights that airasias related-party transactions have ballooned from rm13 million in 2004 to rm1.7 billion in 2014. based on that assumption, airasias heavy net gearing of 263% and high capital intensity, gmt is estimating that the low-cost airline will need some rm7 billion to bring debt down to more sustainable levels, say those who have seen the report. however, as mohshin points out, these concerns have been raised before. we have always highlighted our concerns regarding the rm2,862 million owed by related parties  some of which are overdue. these are mostly aircraft lease payments owed to the parent, in addition to working capital. in this report, we outline a worst-case scenario, [namely] to write off the loans to related parties, to establish a floor valuation, he writes. there are questions with the books, i agree, but there is definitely no questioning the cash profits that this juggernaut is going to churn, he argues, pointing out that at rm1.53, the lowest closing last thursday, airasia is valued at 5.6 times fy2015 earnings. it is noteworthy that mohshin doesnt stand alone. ta securities, for example, has also issued a report on airasia, with a buy call and a target price of rm2.42. so why did gmts report have such a strong impact on airasias share price? analysts point out that gmt has had a track record of doing this successfully, referencing the example of noble group. the modus operandi of these institutions is to spark fear and let the momentum sway things down. first short sell, when it breaks technical support, the technical traders will push it down, and the final leg is for fatigued long-term shareholders to give up. i call this the three pillars of death strategy, explains one analyst. short selling is heavily regulated on bursa malaysia, but that has not stopped investors. following gmts report, short selling in airu00adasias stocks went from non-existent to almost 6.8 million shares by june 18  it was the most highly shorted stock on bursa that day (see chart). in comparison to the total trading volume, however, the amount is small. on june 17 and 18, at the peak of the selling pressure, 170 million and 96.7 million airasia shares changed hands respectively. it doesnt help that foreign funds have been trimming their positions in malaysia, including in airasia, which happens to have high levels of foreign holdings  more than 50%. in fact, bloomberg data shows a sharp selldown by foreign funds over the past few months. airasias largest foreign holders are american-based funds, holding a cumulative 39% of the low-cost airlines shares at its peak in early february. as at last thursday, american funds have trimmed their positions to 29.5%, based on bloomberg data. it is worth noting that foreign funds had been trimming their positions in airasia long before the report came out, to reduce their exposure to the weakening ringgit, among other reasons. the ringgit has already fallen 7% against the us dollar since the start of the year to 3.743. the culmination of these factors have helped drive airasias share price down to a near five-year low, but the question now is whether it will drop further. with foreign funds still exiting malaysian equities, downward selling pressure is expected to continue, but the panic selling of the past two weeks is not expected to go on. as for gmts report, come june 24, investors will get a chance to read it first-hand. but the selling and short selling of airasias shares may be well past their peaks by then, since gmts clients would have had two weeks to act on the advice. the report, at 40 pages long, is said to be strongly worded and puts airu00adasia in a bad light. it comes with a substantial number of references to past cases to support gmts arguments. it might be a well-researched thesis of airasias problems, but it does not come close to presenting an open-and-shut case for the airlines demise. if anything, the recent selldown could be a good buying opportunity for investors, if the 19 buy calls on airasia as compiled by bloomberg are to be believed. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score

to unlock vast landbank", "article": " boustead plantations bhds (bplant) one-year performance since its june 2014 listing on bursa malaysia does not seem to offer much reason to celebrate. but some are saying the counter is worth a second look, and one reason for that is the commercial promise of its vast landbank. the planter, one of the few purely upstream players in the country, saw its share price sink to its lowest level of rm1.31 on june 10, 2015, after its listing, and has been hovering near that since then. it has shed 18.12% from its initial public offering price of rm1.60 a share and lost 9.66% year to date.  further, if bplants (fundamental: na; valuation: na) latest quarterly results are any pointer, the potential for any improvement in its share price also seems limited. but despite that, some analysts say the commercial promise of its landbank is now slowly starting to emerge. last month, the company announced that it would sell two freehold tracts in kulai, johor, measuring a total of 88.17ha, for rm48.99 million cash to third parties. bplant will be pocketing a post-tax disposal gain of rm38 million or 2.4 sen a share. maybank ib research calls the sale a positive surprise as bplant is effectively monetising 185 years of future plantation earnings into one transaction, given the blended average selling price of rm555,631 per ha. this is the companys first land sale since its listing. says a bank-backed analyst, if bplant starts to unlock the value of its landbank, especially parcels with property development potential, its cash levels and balance sheet will start to look very good. that will be a real catalyst. at the current price level, bplant is definitely worth a look. even without that, for investors looking for yield, the company gave above 4% in the financial year ended dec 31, 2014 (fy2014). the yield is not super attractive but it is very stable. i dont think dividend yields will vary too much from that. in terms of its share price, we believe the downside is limited, with negative news flow surrounding the industry already priced into the stock. the upside would, of course, depend on the cpo price. we think the cpo price will rebound in the second half of the year and plantation firms will see better earnings. bplants ability to monetise its valuable landbank features high on the list of its long-term value proposition. at the time of its listing, analysts agreed that bplant shares were worth more than its ipo price, considering the potential value of its landbank. hong leong investment bank research valued the stock at rm1.63 apiece while public invest research gave it a fair value of rm1.74. maybank ib research, which initiated coverage on the company two months after its listing, had a buy call with a target price of rm2.16, representing a 37% upside at that point. after several downward revisions, maybank research said in its latest note on may 20 that it is keeping the buy call but with a lower target price of rm1.65. after the sale of the two tracts in kulai, maybank ib researchs analyst ong chee ting expects more land sales in the near future, given the current low cpo price, which generates less than rm3,000 per ha in operating profit a year for bplant. i believe there are several reasons for bplant to monetise its land. some of the parcels have been in the books for a few decades and are prime for unlocking of value. plantations such as bahau estates in semenyih, selangor, are small, far away from bplants other estates and no longer economically viable to be managed on their own. such land will eventually be monetised, he says. by disposing of highly valued estates that are prime for development and reinvesting part or all the proceeds to acquire greenfield or brownfield estates elsewhere, bplant is actually being more capital efficient. as at end-fy2014, bplant had landbank totalling 83,360ha. of this, about 11,000ha, with a book value of rm800 million, comprises parcels that analysts consider to have property development potential and commercial significance because of their proximity to existing townships or developments. they include a 247ha tract near university of nottingham in semenyih, a 1,176.3ha freehold parcel near the kulai interchange in iskandar malaysia and 1,379ha in malakoff estate, seberang perai utara, penang. if bplant continues to do small disposals every year, it can help boost the bottom line in a big way. downside for its share price is now limited by the steep land value. upside will largely depend on cpos price performance and how aggressive the company unlocks the value of its landbank, says ong. when contacted, bplant tells the edge, we will continue to divest assets that are non-core to bplant in order to realise further value in our investments. any further disposal of land will be announced at the apporpriate juncture in line with disclosure requirements. it is worth noting that its parent, boustead holdings bhd, has a property arm, with most of its projects located in the klang valley. bplant recorded a noticeable fall in revenue and profit in the first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1q2015) due to lower fresh fruit bunch production and bearish palm product prices  issues that have afflicted the entire industry. the quarter is known to be seasonally the weakest for plantation companies, and bplants revenue slid 33.6% to rm131.88 million, while net profit deteriorated 75.6% to just rm7.35 million. if the lower earnings trend persists in the coming quarters, it is clear that disposal of its land will go a long way towards softening the impact of weaker earnings and make the stock attractive to investors again.  note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys

upside support to earnings. overall, however, he expects the groups fy16 earnings to come in relatively flat y-o-y. a check on bloomberg consensus reveals that 19 research houses have coverage on the stock, of which there are only three buy calls, 11 hold and five sell calls. current indicated dividend yields are decent at 5.31%, thus providing downside support to its share price. ambanks chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly down. its share price has made an obvious plunge since its major weekly wave-5 and all-time high of rm7.55 in august 2013. since that rm7.55 high, ambank has tumbled to its july 2015 recent low of rm5.25. as prices broke above their recent key critical support levels of rm6.11 and rm5.97, look to sell ambank on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short- to long-term downtrend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, oscillator and macd) have issued clear sell signals and now depict firm indications of ambanks eventual plunge towards lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm5.47, rm5.97 and rm6.11. we expect ambank to witness weaker buying at its support areas of rm4.72, rm5.13 and rm5.25. its downside targets are located at rm5.02, rm4.84 and rm3.95.  lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at

"article": " banking stocks, once a hot favourite among investors, wont be making a comeback anytime soon, going by the weak financial results that have trickled in for the first quarter and ongoing concerns about asset quality. the mostly neutral calls that analysts have on the sector are likely to stay, even as a slew of earnings downgrades kicks in following the disappointing results of banks like cimb group holdings bhd and affin holdings bhd (ahb). ammb holdings bhd, which last friday reported its earnings for the full year ended march 31, 2015, revised downwards its growth targets for the current year to reflect the more challenging operating environment ahead. david chong, a banking analyst at rhb research institute, says there are no catalysts to prompt an upgrade of the banking sector as yet. he points out that the first quarter has seasonally been a weak one for banks. the environment is still challenging  loan growth has slowed, margins are still under intense pressure, and on the fee-based side, capital market activities havent really kicked in to give banks a boost. additionally, asset quality  not an issue in the previous years  is now something they need to watch, he tells the edge. he currently has a buy call on only one banking stock, public bank bhd. half of the eight malaysian banking groups  public bank (fundamental: 1.8; valuation: 0.91), cimb group (fundamental: 1.05; valuation: 2.1), ahb (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 2.25) and ammb (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 3.0)  have already turned in their results for the quarter ended march 31. except for public banks, the report cards were deemed poor. the results of ahb, the countrys second smallest lender, in particular, caught analysts by surprise. its first-quarter net profit fell  by 79% from a year ago and by 86% from the preceding quarter (4qfy2014)  to rm30 million. this accounted for a mere 5% of analysts consensus forecast for the full year. the shortfall was caused by ahbs one-off loan loss provision of rm124.1 million that quarter  the highest quarterly provision the group has made since the fourth quarter of 2005  at its commercial banking arm, affin bank. it had provided just rm51.5 million in 4qfy2014. with that, ahbs asset quality, as measured by the gross impaired loan (gil) ratio, worsened to 2% compared with 1.8% in the preceding quarter. we observe a jump in impairment of loans extended to the finance, insurance and business services sector by rm149.3 million in 1qfy15 as compared with the preceding quarter, notes midf research analyst kelvin ong. the weak results prompted several analysts to lower their earnings estimates for ahb. rhb research cut its fy2015-fy2017 net profit forecasts by 12%, to 25%. while 2015 will see the first full-year consolidation of (ahbs) hwangdbs investment bank acquisition, we expect asset quality to hog the spotlight instead, following the deterioration noted in 1q2015 results, the research house said in a recent note to clients. last wednesday, cimb, the countrys second largest lender, announced a first-quarter net profit of rm580.1 million, which came in at just 14% of analysts consensus estimates for the full year. it missed expectations largely because of high loan loss provisions at its indonesian bank and a one-time restructuring cost of rm202 million relating to the rationalisation of its investment banking business. the net profit was 45.6% lower than that of the previous corresponding quarter because of a 379.4% rise in loan loss provisions to rm534.3 million. the provisions in the quarter were nevertheless lower than the rm919.2 million in 4qfy2014, which helped cimbs earnings jump 189.6% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. its gil ratio worsened slightly to 3.18% from 3.09% as at end-december. cimb told analysts that provisions for bad loans in indonesia would remain high in the second quarter, but less than that in the previous two quarters. if provisions from indonesia continue to trend lower and if there is a boost in capital market activity, then cimbs second-quarter earnings should be better than the first. but then, there is also the question of how much restructuring costs they will take in, rhbs chong observes. just two weeks ago, cimb announced a mutual separation scheme (mss) for its employees in malaysia and indonesia in a bid to reduce costs within the group. staff costs make up 55% of the groups total cost. cimb had incurred a cost of rm217 million in its last mss exercise in 2013, which saw 1,217 staff take up the offer. this time around, the cost could double, as the mss also involves the indonesian operations, cimb told analysts last week. its weak start to the year also has analysts questioning whether it will be able to meet its return on equity (roe) target of 11% (excluding restructuring costs) for fy2015. cimb cited higher-than-expected net interest margin (nim) pressure and challenging economic conditions as key challenges to the target. while cimb had earlier guided for nim compression of 5 to 15 basis points, management now thinks nim may compress by around 20 basis points, says rhb research. it cut its fy2015 net profit forecast for cimb by 16%. meanwhile, mid-sized lender ammb reported an 8% growth in net profit for the full year (fy2015) to rm1.92 billion, but analysts point out that the earnings were boosted by exceptional gains. underlying profit was down by 3%. the groups revenue fell by 4.8% to rm9.14 billion, while roe came in at 13.8%. following the results, ammbs management guided for a more moderate net profit growth of 3% to 5% for fy2016, and roe of 12% to 12.5%. it had earlier eyed net profit growth of 6% to 10% and roe of 14%. the issue is that nim is still expected to contract by 15 to 20 basis points in fy2016, an analyst notes. in the fourth quarter of fy2015, ammbs net profit grew 12% to rm519.2 million, mainly because of write-backs that mitigated the impact of lower revenue. its gil ratio improved to 1.79% from 1.88%. public bank fared the best among the banks. last month, it reported a 15.2% rise in its first quarter net profit to rm1.17 billion despite the tougher environment, helped by a decent increase in net interest income and non-interest income. the results came in within analysts expectations. its gil improved to 0.6% from 0.7%. according to bloomberg data, public bank has performed the best among the eight banking groups in the stock market for the year to date, with a total return of 6.36%, followed by malayan banking bhd (maybank) (4.58%) and cimb (4.26%).  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on may 25 - 31, 2015."}, "285": {"date_posted": "17/6/2015", "title": "astro down 4% on cautious prospects",

its sixth consecutive quarterly loss on higher foreign exchange (forex) loss on borrowings, which more than tripled to rm89.2 million in 1qfy15 due to the weakening ringgit. the long-haul budget

will be a better indication, he said. we believe we can turnaround operationally by this year. we will take one step at a time. kamaruddin expressed confidence that the rationalisation and integration measures undertaken, as well as efforts to minimise inefficiencies at aax will help return the airline to net profitability. furthermore, he expects associate thai airasia x co ltd and joint-venture firm pt indonesia airasia extra to contribute positively to aax going forward. analysts, however, were not convinced of aaxs turnaround plans to return to profitability this year. an aviation analyst noted that all the restructuring efforts need to show an impact on the financial results. what investors dont need is more rhetoric, but what they need [impressive financial] figures. if aax can show profit in one or two quarters, investors will be more convinced, he said. the stock needs to perform in order for interest to comeback. we dont see it as attractive now, he stressed. hong leongs wong concurred, saying aaxs share price has somewhat been affected by the wider 1qfy15 net loss, apart from the rights issue it undertook recently. whether or not the share price will decline further depends on aaxs performance in the coming quarters, he said. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers.

"cover story: rhb in transition", "article": " rhb capital bhds outgoing group managing director kellee kam believes that the reorganisation of the group comes at an opportune time. this is wisdom from my board. they say that in business, there are seasons. when its summer or autumn, you go out, make the best of it. you farm, you build your business. but when it is winter, dont go out and start planting or hunting. you are not going to get good deals, you are going to do yourself harm. we believe that things will start to slow, he tells the edge in an exclusive interview. this year, a lot of our focus really is on getting more efficiencies in productivity, in people, in our cost and capital base. part of this led to the reorganisation. it is a reorganisation that tries to address, frankly, multiple things at the same time and underlying it all, we believe that it will create additional shareholder value. despite the tougher operating environment, kam stresses that rhb caps ignite 2017 transformation vision is very much on track. the one major outcome that i have guided to the market that will change is how aggressive we will be in overseas expansion, he says, adding that the target for overseas contribution by 2017 will be revised to 20%, rather than 30%, of group revenue. the focus [on expanding overseas] will be on a less capital-intensive route. there is a possibility that the investment bank will be used to spearhead that. a regional network makes the most sense for our investment banking platform to capitalise on flows. in our mind, it doesnt make sense to push for 30% in the current environment, kam says, adding that the two missing markets are indonesia and the philippines (see q&a on page 64). on the reorganisation, kam says the recent changes in the industry and the regulations  such as consolidated capital ratios under the new financial services act 2013  have made the current structure of the group inefficient. thus, the group is undertaking an internal restructuring and a rights issue that will result in the banking business  rhb bank bhd  taking over the listing status of rhb cap. the proposed rights issue of new shares is expected to raise up to rm2.5 billion. following this, the group is expected to see interest savings of rm150 million and tax savings of rm35 million to rm40 million. all of the earnings uplift will be on a smaller book value, resulting in an increase in return on equity (roe). the groups common equity tier 1 (cet1) ratio is expected to increase to at least 11% from the current 9% while earnings per share is expected to be diluted by between 10% and 30%. credit suisse research expects roe to improve to 12.1% to 14.3% versus 10.8% to 12.2% under the current holding company structure. firstly, we are moving the efficiencies up. secondly, the holding company discount has been removed, so we bring our shareholders directly into the banking group. and thirdly, there are efficiencies because of a better credit rating. holding companies are always rated differently from the actual operating companies. in our case, the bank is rated aa and the holding company an a  one notch down. with the reorganisation, the actual borrowing and expansion vehicle is an aa company. its a much stronger company. so, when it comes to borrowing and expansion, you [will] see all these savings, kam explains. and when we raise rm2.5 billion, the book value of the new listed entity is actually lower because we have eliminated part of the goodwill that sits at rhb cap. most rights issues will see a dilution in roe because the shareholders funds go up and roe goes down. but in our case, because of how it is structured, the roe goes up. this, kam says, is why a re-rating of the new listed entitys stock makes sense. if you think about it, it has stronger roe than the preceding company. it is a stronger credit-rated company and there is no holding company, so you are directly sitting with the bank operating company itself. so, if you look at it from all perspectives, from the shareholders perspective, it makes perfect sense. from an expansion standpoint, to have a bank, as opposed to a holding company, spearhead the expansion as we go out into the region also makes perfect sense.  rhb cap  a takeover target rhb cap was the result of a merger of banks that included kwong yik bank bhd, dcb bank bhd, sime bank bhd and utama banking group. it was a takeover target because of its vulnerability then  it was left with heavy debts and had to be restructured after sinking into a sea of red with losses reaching hundreds of million ringgit during the 1997/98 asian financial crisis. the banking group has been restructured and strengthened since 2007, when the employees provident fund (epf) emerged as the single largest shareholder of rhb cap after winning a bidding war. it beat rival buyers eon capital bhd and a kuwait finance house-led consortium. the retirement funds rm2.25 billion cash offer to raise its holding in the rhb group later resulted in a couple of corporate exercises as it had to pare down its 82% stake. as a result, the epf sold a 25% stake to abu dhabi commercial bank in 2008. this stake was later sold to aabar investments pjsc. the epf has a 41.3% stake in rhb cap today while aabar holds 21.4% and osk holdings bhd 9.9%. in recent years, rhb cap has seen a couple of attempted takeovers  by malayan banking bhd and cimb group holdings bhd in 2011 and by cimb again last year. rhb cap itself went on an acquisition drive, buying osk investment bank for rm1.95 billion in 2012. this gave it the regional platform it was looking for. rhb cap gained immediate access to the equity, investment banking and fund management businesses in singapore, hong kong, china, thailand and indonesia. on top of that, it has equity and investment banking operations as well as a full-fledged commercial bank in cambodia. since its restructuring in 2007 and the slew of corporate exercises, the fourth largest local banking group has been steadily strengthening its position, as indicated by its improved earnings performance. from a net profit of rm316 million in fy2005, rhb cap saw its bottom line increase to rm2.04 billion in fy2014. its asset base of rm89.9 billion in 2005 expanded to rm219.3 billion in 2014. kam, who had joined the group 13 years ago, has seen at least three takeover attempts and a couple of restructuring and merger exercises. rhb is probably one of the [few] companies that have seen so many major events in that span of time in corporate malaysia. some companies go through big events and dont survive  they end up being taken over or bailed out. now, rhb has gone through crisis after crisis after crisis. and because of that, the team and some board members who have been through it all with us have a strong bond, he says, adding that the events did not only affect the top people but everyone in the group. in a way, weve gone through a lot, with five to six major events in the space of seven to eight years. thats an event every 1u00bd years. we engage with the team. we want to have this shared vision and passion to make the company better and better. the one thing we pride ourselves on is that the senior team believes in this shared ambition and passion and the growth of the group [as well] u2026 [it is] not just spearheaded at the senior level. we are open to talking to anyone in the group. kam proudly adds that the groups performance has not dipped despite the takeover attempts, which can be distracting. we have had an unbroken profit growth track record for the last 10 years in spite of what has been happening. sometimes, people dont give the group enough credit because they compare us with companies that are on a steady path, those that did not have to worry about [takeover attempts]. for rhb, it is always about consistency. an analyst with a local bank-backed research house says rhb cap has done well despite the distractions and changes in top management over the years. they should continue to do well this year. they were without a full management team over the past years but were still able to generate results, which picked up momentum when they got a full team on board at the end of 2013. despite the merger distraction last year and given the fact that the ignite 2017 strategy  which provides greater focus for the group  was just introduced in the first quarter of 2014, the group has done pretty well. they also introduced the connect strategy last august, which is aimed at motivating and empowering internal personnel, especially at the branch level. productivity levels have improved because of it, he says. another banking analyst with a foreign bank says he thinks that operationally, things are going well for the group. they seem to be gaining market share despite the distractions. the team seems to be working quite well together. on the investment banking side, the merger with osk seems to have worked out quite well. the group did very well last year u2026 they have been gaining market share in loans and deposits. the only area where there is concern is margins u2026 they need to try and control the drop. their margins are a little bit lower than the industry average and that is why they are focusing on the small and medium enterprise side. kam shares that the groups strategies have always been premised on laying the foundations for future growth as well as building a strong team and a solid succession plan. the team is very much intact [to ensure a smooth transition], he says, referencing his exit from the group on may 4. i literally grew up here, reflects kam. thirteen years. some people work longer in organisations but i literally grew up here. the people who brought me in gave me the opportunities. it wouldnt be for any other reason than the fact that i think at this stage, it deserves a better person than me, from the standpoint that i am feeling tired. that is what i told the board. if i could still progress at the pace that i believe the company needs, i would stay. but i believe we have built a very strong team. we have a fantastic roadmap. and i always say that when my team is moving faster than i am, then i need to let the team move ahead.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on

latest meetings minutes. recent economic data suggested that the american economy seemed too weak for an interest hike in june. despite the likelihood of stable and low interest rates, the s&p 500 index inched down 1.98 points to 2,125.85 points while the dow declined 26.99 points to end at 18,285.40. in malaysia, the fbm klci index moved in a wider range of 30.16 points for the week with higher volumes of 1.92 billion to 2.45 billion traded. the index closed at 1,795.04 yesterday, down 15.07 points from the previous day as blue chip stocks like axiata group bhd, cimb group holdings, digi.com bhd, ihh healthcare bhd and sapurakencana petroleum bhd caused the index to decline on some obvious liquidation activities. the ringgit was a touch weaker against the us dollar at 3.6020 as brent crude oil turned weaker at us$64.70 (rm232.92) per barrel. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (oct 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 comprised key swings of 1,837.28 (low), 1,879.62 (high), 1,766.22 (low), 1,858.09 (high), 1,671.82 (low), 1,810.21 (high), 1,706.18 (low), 1,831.41 (high), 1,774.30 (low) and 1,867.53 (high). all the indexs daily signals are negative for now, with its cci, dmi, macd, stochastic and oscillator indicators showing much weaker readings. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at the 1,770, 1,774 and 1,793 levels, while the resistance areas of 1,795, 1,823 and 1,867 will cap any index rebound. the klcis 18 and 40 simple moving averages (sma) depict an emerging downtrend with a dead cross for its daily chart. the recent price bars of the index have just turned below the 50 and 200 sma. as such, the index remains on its downturn from its recent 1,867.53 high in late april. upon a break of the critical intermediate support of 1,795, the index may head towards its next downside targets of 1,780, 1,764 and 1,727. due to the poorer tone for the klci index, we are recommending a chart sell on uem sunrise bhd (uems). looking at the most recent fourth quarter financial year 2014 (4qfy14) result announcement, the group recorded higher revenues compared with the preceding year in the same quarter to rm1.341 billion from rm573.1 million in 4qfy13. gerbang land sales to fastrack iskandar sdn bhd of rm248 million and scope energy sdn bhd of rm522.7 million contributed to the higher revenue. correspondingly, profit before tax was also higher in 4qfy14 compared with 4qfy13. looking at the full 12 months financial year 2014 estimate (12mfy14e) compared with 12mfy13e, profit before tax was lower due to lower margins from land sales despite better revenues generated. however, this was mitigated by higher profits from property development. a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that 20 research houses cover the stock. of the 20 reports, there are six buy, 12 hold and two sell calls on uems. the stock currently trades at a reasonable and low historical price earnings ratio of 11 times. its price-to-book value ratio of 0.83 times indicates that its share price is trading at a discount to its book value while uems has an indicative dividend yield of 2.45%. uemss chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly timeframes are very firmly down. its share price made an obvious plunge since its major weekly wave-2 high of rm3.09 on july 19, 2013. since that high, uems has tumbled to its may 2015 recent low of rm1.16. as prices broke above its recent key critical support levels of rm1.44 and rm1.29, look to sell uems on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict a very firm short-to-longer term down-trend for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, oscillator and stochastic) have issued clear sell signals and now depict firm indications of uemss eventual plunge towards lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm1.16, rm1.29 and rm1.44. we expect uems to witness weaker buying at its support areas of rm0.89, rm1.05 and rm1.14. its downside targets are located at rm0.93, rm0.78 and rm0.44. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed in the article are the

" cimb group holdings bhd is likely to have a weak start to the year, if the first quarter financial results of its indonesian and thai banking subsidiaries are any indication. higher levels of provision for bad loans in pt bank cimb niaga tbk and cimb thai bank pcl saw each of them turning in a worse-than-expected performance last week. this will continue to weigh on cimb groups earnings, say analysts. the group had one of its worst quarterly performances in the fourth quarter of last year, mainly because of high provisions. cimb group (fundamental: 1.05; valuation: 1.65) is expected to announce its first quarter results next month. generally, we expected a weak quarter because of cimb niaga, alliancedbs says in a research note. however, the malaysian business should see a better quarter in the absence of goodwill impairment for the investment banking business and a one-off large provision related to a legacy corporate account that was booked in the fourth quarter of 2014 (4q2014), the research house adds. the malaysia operation still accounts for the biggest chunk of cimb groups earnings. indonesia made up 19% of the groups full-year earnings in 2014, but in better years, it used to be about 30%. last wednesday, cimb groups 97.94%-owned indonesian bank, cimb niaga, reported a 92.4% drop in net profit to idr83 billion for the first quarter ended march 31, 2015 (1qfy2015). this accounted for just 2% to 3% of analyst consensus estimates for the full year. the dismal performance was mainly due to a 619.4% year-on-year increase in provision expenses, to idr1.45 trillion. the provisions were, nevertheless, lower by 26.2% than that in 4q2014. this helped cimb niagas net profit rise by 80.4% on a quarter-on-quarter basis from a low base of idr46 billion in 4q2014. in an interview with the edge last month, cimb group ceo tengku datuk zafrul aziz indicated that cimb niagas provisions in the first quarter would be lower than in 4q2014. we are hopeful that the second quarter onwards will be better. nobody can foresee the future [but] we can safely say the fourth quarter [of 2014] is the worst, he said. analysts, however, think provisions will remain high in the second quarter too. provision for loan losses are likely to remain elevated in 2q2015 but lower than the preceding two quarters, midf research banking analyst kelvin ong says following a results briefing by cimb niagas management last week. given the weaker economic environment, loan growth slowed to 9.6%, while non-interest income fell by 29.4% because of weaker treasury market activities and lower bancassurance fees. cimb niagas asset quality continued to deteriorate, with the gross non-performing loan (npl) ratio rising to 4.1% compared with 2.57% a year ago, and 3.9% as at end-december 2014. vice-president and director d james rompas blames this on the tougher economic conditions, volatile rupiah and softer commodity prices. nonetheless, some analysts question whether the bank could have fared better if its credit controls in the past had been tighter. about 4% to 5% of cimb niagas total loan book is exposed to the troubled coal and coal-related segments. of these, 40% are classified as non-performing. the coal segment aside, analysts say the banks management is also wary of asset quality in the manufacturing sector. management expects the weak operating environment to persist into 2q2015 and guides for ongoing net interest margin (nim) compression. provisioning levels are expected to remain elevated in 2q2015, but management does not expect the gross npl ratio to breach 5%, maybank investment bank researchs desmond chng says in a note to clients last thursday. while we think that our provisioning assumptions are sufficiently conservative, the operating environment has been weaker than expected. cutting our nim and non-interest income assumptions, we downgrade cimb niagas fy2015 and fy2016 net profit forecasts by 23% and 11% [respectively], with an estimated 6% and 3% impact on cimb groups earnings, he adds. meanwhile, last tuesday, the groups 93.71%-owned thai bank, cimb thai, reported a 70.4% slump in first quarter net profit to thb130.6 million. this accounted for only 15% of analysts full-year forecast. unlike cimb niaga, however, cimb thais contribution to cimb group is small, at less than 3%. cimb thais results are reflective of the still challenging economic environment prevalent in the country, evidenced by the 117.6% year-on-year spike in provisions, says publicinvest research. the provision was 41.9% higher than that in the preceding quarter. cimb thais loan growth was a tepid 2.7%. gross npl worsened to 3.7% from 3.3% as at end-december due to lower repayments from several corporate accounts. just last monday, public bank bhd kicked off the reporting season for the january-march quarter among banks. despite a tougher operating environment, the banking group turned in a 15% rise in net profit to rm1.17 billion, which was within analysts expectations. maybank ib research cut its call on cimb group to sell from hold, but kept its target price at rm5.70 pending the release of its results. according to bloomberg data, most analysts have a hold call on the stock. the stock, which has gained 10.4% this year, closed at rm6.09 last friday.  note: the edge researchs fundamental

(fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 1.4) was selected an index constituent in december 2012 at a time when its market capitalisation stood at some rm19 billion. its market cap is now just rm7.59 billion. in a report last friday, maybank ib research sees fgv exiting as an fbm klci constituent as it ranked 41st in terms of market cap, and being replaced by westports holdings bhd which ranked 28th by market cap at rm14.83 billion. the fbm klci index series is reviewed semi-annually by the independent ftse bursa malaysia index advisory committee. according to maybank ib research, the list is due for a review, using share prices at market close on may 25, 2015. the constituent changes will be implemented after the market closes on june 19, and will be effective june 22. among the companies currently on the list are public bank bhd, tenaga nasional bhd, malayan banking bhd, cimb group holdings bhd and axiata group bhd. rhb research institute head of research alexander chia is also of the view that fgv will be dropped from the fbm klci constituent list next month. he pointed to the five counters on the fbm klci reserve list, namely ytl power international bhd, gamuda bhd, westports, hap seng consolidated bhd and ijm corp bhd, that will likely take over fgvs place. in a report dated april 6, 2015, kenanga research also did not rule out the risk of fgv being removed from the fbm klci constituent list during the next review should its share price decline further. it noted that fgvs share price has performed poorly in the last six months, plummeting 38% since october 2014 compared with the kl plantation index which declined 6% in the same period. however, the risk to fgvs potential exit as an fbm klci constituent is that the stock may drop off the radar of

cement industry", "article": " cement consumption in malaysia will not be robust in the near future, even though there are ongoing infrastructure projects. the key factor that has curbed the growth in demand is the slowdown in the property sector. lower energy costs expected this year will provide some breathing space for cement producers such as lafarge malaysia bhd, tasek corp bhd and hume industries bhd. demand, however, is forecast to increase between 3% and 4% this year  lower than last years 5% to 6% growth, according to analysts covering the cement sector. the property development sector makes up 50% to 60% of total cement demand in malaysia, says alliancedbs research analyst woo kim toh, who covers lafarge malaysia. with the sector slowing down, infrastructure projects were expected to pick up the slack. however, demand from infrastructure projects such as the mrt line 2 and lrt extensions have largely been priced in to the share prices of cement producers. compounding the situation is the additional capacity expected to come on stream this year. ytl cement bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ytl corp bhd (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 1.4), will add 1.5 million tonnes or 8% capacity to the industry. market leader lafarge malaysia (fundamental: 1.8; valuation: 1.1) is currently expanding the capacity of its plants in rawang, selangor, and kanthan, perak, which will add 1.2 million tonnes to the industry. interestingly, lafarge malaysia and tasek corp (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 1.7) are still trading at high price-earnings ratio of 33 times and 19 times respectively. indeed, the valuations are higher than that of construction companies such as wct holdings bhd and gamuda bhd, which are trading at 16 times earnings per share. the illiquid nature of lafarge malaysia and tasek corp is partly to blame for the persistently high valuations. lafarge sa of france holds a 51% stake in lafarge malaysia, followed by the employees provident fund with 9%, while hl cement (m) sdn bhd and aberdeen asset management hold 74.3% and 20.24% equity interest respectively in tasek corp. institutional investors and funds like to hold on to cement producers because of the decent yield. despite the below-expectation results of lafarge malaysia last year, the company still paid good dividends, says woo. dividend yields of cement producers stand at 3% to 4%, based on last thursdays share price. despite the expected slowdown in demand, lafarge malaysia president and chief executive bradley mulroney is still sanguine about the prospects of the cement market. market demand is reasonably strong. there are still a lot of infrastructure and housing developments taking place, mulroney tells the edge. however, large infrastructure projects only account for about 40% of the total cement market in malaysia, he says, adding that the property development sector is the driving force behind local cement demand. even if you get very strong growth in infrastructure, it only makes up 40% of the market anyway. it is very important but not to be exaggerated. the difficult market conditions for cement producers can be seen from the keen price competition. cement producers compete by giving customers rebates. according to alliancedbs researchs woo, during good times when demand is strong, the rebate ranges from rm30 to rm40 per tonne. due to the slowing demand from the property development sector and the impending excess capacity, cement producers have been reducing their prices even more. on average, cement producers have been giving rebates of up to rm100 per bag, says woo. lower energy costs a slight reprieve energy costs make up about 30% to 40% of the production cost. the recent 5.8% average reduction in electricity tariffs until oct 15 is a temporary reprieve for cement manufacturers, cimb research analyst sharizan rosely says in a report dated feb 17. however, it is still insufficient to offset the average tariff increase of 16.9% last year, he adds. lower coal prices this year compared with last year will also benefit cement producers. coal prices fell to us$56.60 per tonne on april 15, 26.2% lower than a year ago. coal is largely used to fire rotary kilns during the blending of the raw materials to produce cement. nevertheless, the weak ringgit has erased this advantage  coal is mostly imported and are priced in us dollars, says a senior industry executive. the industrys practice of buying coal up to 24 months in advance could also have worsened the situation, as companies may have locked in a higher price for the fuel, the executive adds. analysts covering lafarge malaysia have mixed views on the stock. hlib research has a buy call on the stock with a target price of rm10.72, while ammb research and maybank ib research are calling a hold with target prices of rm8.90 and rm9.30 respectively. kenanga research and alliancedbs research have sell calls with target prices of rm8.20 and rm8.30 per share respectively. meanwhile, cimb research is the sole research house covering tasek corp  it has a hold call with a target price of rm16.46. no research house covers hume. as at last thursday, lafarge malaysias share price had increased 3.7% year to date to rm10.04 per share, giving the group a market capitalisation of rm8.53 billion. tasek corps share price increased 3.32% ytd to

in gst prepaid issue", "article": "  kuala lumpur: the new pay-per-use goods and services tax (gst) system for prepaid mobile services, as announced by the communication and multimedia ministry, is positive for mobile telecommunications companies (telcos), analysts said, but there is likely to be an impact on usage. as a result, they estimate the new model to provide a 3% pass through instead of a full 6%. publicinvest research analyst lee wee sieng said the new system will be positive for key mobile players. while telcos will incur additional costs to reconfigure their systems and produce new prepaid top-up cards, we believe the benefits from passing through gst on prepaid services will outweigh the additional costs of reconfiguration to collect gst based on usage, said lee in a report yesterday. the research house named digi.com bhd (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 1.7) as the main beneficiary of the move, as its prepaid segment contributes 73% to its revenue  the highest among mobile players. lee also noted that digis share price performance has been relatively weak in the past month, partly due to uncertainty about the gst implementation. amresearch analyst hafriz hezry said while the outcome of the move is mostly positive as telcos will be able to pass on gst to consumers, consumer usage is likely to be impacted. this model in itself can impact usage, on top of ultra-price sensitive prepaid users which might simply pare usage given the higher effective cost, he said, adding that he has conservatively only factored in a 3% pass through instead of a full 6% in his projections. hafriz noted that under the new pay-per-use gst system, the chargeable gst amount is taken out of prepaid credits, which essentially means that for a rm10 reload (and assuming full usage), consumers only get rm9.40 of actual credit. amresearch prefers axiata group bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 1.1) as its top pick for the sector, as it expects a turnaround in subsidiaries pt xl axiatas and celcom axiata bhds performance in the second half of 2015. maybank investment bank bhd (maybank ib) analyst tan chi wei also deems the announcement of the new system as a satisfactory outcome for mobile telcos, but noted that the impact on companies bottom lines is not clear-cut. there are elasticity considerations, and competition remains intense. this means part of the newfound revenue could be returned to customers in the form of lower effective tariffs, he said, adding that reload sales could have already been affected in april and may, due to the confusion over the gst treatment. however, on the governments call for telcos to lower tariffs, tan said it should not be an issue, as tariffs will trend down over time due to technological improvements. maybank ib named maxis bhd (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 1.1) and axiata as its top picks for the sector. on wednesday, communications and multimedia minister datuk seri ahmad shabery cheek announced that the gst of 6% for mobile prepaid reloads will be based on usage rather than being charged upon the purchase of reloads. telcos have been given six months to implement the new system. in a statement yesterday, communications and multimedia consumer forum of malaysia (cfm) said implementing the new change is a massive effort which is expected to take more than half a year to complete. the decision to change the basis of charging gst from activation to usage is not as simple as an on/off switch. it involves complex reconfiguration of the telcos backend systems as well as those of over 30,000 third party retailers, resellers and agents such as financial institutions, electronic payment providers, supermarkets, petrol stations and all other sales agents, it added. digi shares closed up 0.34% at rm5.98 yesterday, while maxis share price settled at rm7.03, down 0.28%. axiata shares ended the day up 0.89% at rm6.79. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys

shareholders with a record high dividend of 54 sen per share, translating into a handsome dividend yield of 6.7%. bursa (fundamental: 2.3; valuation: 1.7) has seen its share price climb steadily since late 2013. the meltdown in the share prices of oil and gas companies did not dampen interest in bursas shares  they are still moving higher. closing at rm8.65 last thursday, they are currently hovering near a 3u00bd-year high. besides being a good proxy for investor interest in the local stock exchange, bursas regular dividend payments have increased the appeal of its shares. in the past five years, the company has declared dividend per share of no less than 20 sen. however, the slowdown in initial public offering (ipo) activity raises concerns about the vibrancy of the local bourse, which may affect bursas earnings and, in turn, its dividend payments. there were no ipos in the first quarter of this year. bioalpha holdings bhd, scheduled to be listed on april 14, will be the first new listing on the local exchange this year. meanwhile, there have been three privatisation exercises since the start of the year. two large ipos, malakoff corp bhd and 1malaysia development bhds edra global energy bhd, are expected this year. in the first quarter of last year, there were three ipos, including ioi properties group bhd. the property developer was the first and the largest ipo in 2014, raising rm1.9 billion. there were 14 ipos in total last year, raising a combined rm5.9 billion  28% lower than the rm8.2 billion raised in 2013. the number of public listed companies on the local bourse has been on a downward trend. from 957 companies in 2010, it shrank to 906 last year. similarly, the number of new listings have decreased  there were 29 new listings in 2010 compared with 28 in 2011, 17 in 2012, 18 in 2013 and 14 in 2014. in contrast, the total funds raised rose to rm24.3 billion in 2014 from rm22.5 billion in 2013. a total of rm32 billion was raised in 2012 compared with rm15 billion in 2011 and rm33 billion in 2010. bursa is not the only stock exchange that is seeing a slowdown in ipo exercises this year. as at end-march, singapore only had one ipo listing. meanwhile, the stock exchange of thailand saw five listings in the first quarter of this year while the indonesia stock exchange had two. from a capital markets perspective, the macro outlook is still quite challenging. there is always a time lag before deals start flowing into the market. we wont be seeing many large deals coming out, says a senior executive at an investment bank. but having said that, there is still a lot of ongoing domestic projects and there will be a need to raise capital. he explains that while some of the government-linked infrastructure companies and agencies will tap the bond market, subcontractors and core construction players will likely raise fresh capital through rights or capital placements. there will still be some activities but it will not be the same influx that we saw a few years ago, says the executive. he adds that another challenging factor that bursa is facing is the relatively steep valuation of stocks. the (local) stock market is very much dominated by a few institutions. valuations (wise), it is high and earnings are on a downward trend u2026 the challenge is to manage that. nonetheless, an analyst covering bursas shares believes that the number of listings could increase. but if they dont, i do not expect (bursas) earnings to come off that much as any drop in revenue could be offset by cost measures. they have always talked about cutting cost and being more efficient. dividend yields shouldnt be impacted much as they have been paying special dividends u2026 bursa still has a lot of cash, says the analyst. as at dec 31, 2014, the company had rm214 million in cash. it started paying special dividends in 2013. its cost-to-income ratio improved to 46.1% in 2014 compared with 48.3% in 2013 and 49.3% in 2012. the analyst, however, notes that trading volume for the first three months of the year has been flat year on year. according to data on bursas website, the average trading value for the first quarter was rm2.17 billion while for the same period last year, it was rm2.16 billion. at best, we think its first quarter earnings for the year will be flat on a year-on-year basis. last year, it made a net profit of rm45 million, says the analyst. maybank investment bank research has forecast a 97% dividend payout ratio. there is room for further capital management. we would not be surprised if another special dividend comes in this year. its high yields should cushion any downside to its share price from ongoing volatilities, it says in a report dated jan 30. meanwhile, amresearch expects softer trading volumes in 2015, especially in the first half of the year, in view of investors heightened risk aversion amid the current market uncertainties and the implementation of the goods and services tax in april. while the pipeline of ipos this year looks promising (in value terms), we caution that excessive market volatility may result in some listings being deferred. we also highlight that in 2012, when a similar amount (about rm30 billion) was raised, adtv (average daily trading volume) declined by 7% y-o-y. that said, we believe that volumes will be well supported moving into 2h as cashed-up domestic institutional funds (42% of total value traded) return to the market, says amresearch in a report dated jan 30. in its 2014 annual report, bursa says, despite fewer ipos in 2014 compared with 2013, we retained our position as the largest fundraising destination in asean for the third consecutive year, having raised rm24.3 billion through ipos and the secondary market. the total represents an 8% increase from the rm22.5 billion raised in 2013. note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength,

financial statements for financial year 2014 (fy14). the board of masteel will be making an application to bursa to seek an extension of time up to june 30, 2015 to issue the fy14 audited financial statements. the delay was due to the external auditors of the company not being able to express an opinion due to various issues pertaining to the classification, description and recoverability of various transactions carried out by the company in fy14. in response to this, the management has initiated a special audit on the issues raised by the external auditors. this special audit is expected to be completed in six weeks time.  a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that three research houses cover the stock. masteel currently trades at a low historical price-earnings ratio of 8.16

masteel has tumbled to its may 2015 recent low of 57.5 sen. as prices broke above its recent key critical support levels of 82 sen and 80 sen, look to sell masteel on any rallies to its resistance

points to 2,106.63 points while the dow rose 75.91 points to end at 18,112.61. in malaysia, the fbm klci moved in a narrow range of 12.85 points for the week with higher volumes of 2.02 billion to 2.70 billion shares traded. the index closed at 1,847.94 yesterday, up 7.81 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like ammb holdings bhd, genting bhd, ioi corp bhd, public bank bhd and tenaga nasional bhd caused the index to rise on some late afternoon buying activities. the ringgit was firmer against the us dollar at 3.6575 as brent crude oil surged to us$60.55 (rm221.8) per barrel. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (oct 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 comprised of key swings of 1,837.28 (low), 1,879.62 (high), 1,766.22 (low), 1,858.09 (high), 1,671.82 (low), 1,810.21 (high), 1,706.18 (low), 1,831.41 (high) and 1,774.30 (low). all the indexs daily signals are mixed at the moment, with its cci, dmi, stochastic and oscillator indicators showing upbeat readings. however, the macd has displayed some negative signals. as such, the indexs obvious support levels are seen at the 1,795, 1,836 and 1,847 levels, while the resistance areas of 1,856, 1,879 and 1,896 will cap the indexs rise. the fbm klcis 18- and 40-day simple moving averages (sma) depict a good uptrend for its daily chart. the recent price bars of the index are now also above the 50- and 200-day sma and is also positive on that front. with this, the index has taken on a firmly positive tone recently. due to the much improved tone for the fbm klci, we are recommending a chart buy on e a technique (m) sdn bhd. looking at the most recent fourth quarter financial year 2014 (4qfy14) results announcement, the group recorded an increase in revenue of rm34.6 million to rm155.7 million from rm121.1 million in 4qfy13. the higher revenue was attributed to full-year operations for contracts secured in 2013. despite the higher revenue number recorded, profit before tax (pbt) fell to rm19.8 million for 2014 (in fy14e) from rm59.4 million in fy13e. the weaker pbt number was despite a gain in disposal of an associate in fy13e amounting to rm37.5 million and share of profits from an associate amounting to rm2.9 million. further to the announcement, the board of e a technique remains optimistic that the companys profitability would improve. this is on the back of it having recently secured a new contract in february 2015 for the engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning of a floating, storage and offloading facility for the full field development project in the north malay basin, valued at us$191.8 million for 20 months. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that no research house covers the stock. e a technique currently trades at a historical price-earnings ratio of 19.6 times. its price-to-book value of 1.54 times indicates that its share price is trading at a premium to its book value. the chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frame is very firmly up. its share price made a good surge since its major daily wave-2 low of rm0.525 on march 5, 2014. since that rm0.525 low, e a technique surged to its april 2015 recent all-time high of rm0.74. as prices broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of rm0.63 and rm0.705, look to buy the stock on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term uptrends for this stock. the daily indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, stochastic and oscillator) have issued buy signals and now depict very firm indications of e a techniques eventual surge towards much higher levels. it would attract firm buying activities at the support levels of rm0.63, rm0.705 and rm0.72. we expect e a technique to witness some profit-taking at its resistance area and all-time high of rm0.74. its upside targets are located at rm0.83, rm1.02 and rm1.17. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed in the article are the

[but] at 3% to 4% yield, they are steady but not excellent. investors can get that with many other sectors, he added. in an april 2 note, alliancedbs research had conservatively assumed a 3% effective increase in prepaid revenue for the mobile players as it thinks that usage might be slightly impacted due to price inflation in the economy. this had previously led to an earnings upgrade of about 2% to 5% for the mobile players in financial year 2015 (fy15) and fy16, said alliancedbs research. maybank ib researchs analyst tan chi wei, who has an overweight call on malaysian telcos, in a note on the same day also assumed that operators would enjoy the equivalent of a 3% pass-through in service taxes in its earnings forecast. both research houses noted that digi.com bhd (digi) (fundamental: 1.55; valuation: 2.10), which has the highest percentage of revenue generated from prepaid subscribers compared to its peers, will benefit the most out of the price increase. however, more importantly, they both noted that the benefit had already been priced in or reflected in digis share price. digi has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 4.1%, according to theedgemarkets.com. in contrast, maxis bhds 12-month rolling is at 5.57%. meanwhile, cimb researchs analyst, foong choong chen, who has an underweight call on the sector, said in a note, also on april 2, that the risk-reward of telcos is unfavourable due to their current rich valuations and a potentially more intense competition this year. to recap, telcos increased their top-up voucher or reload coupon price by 6% after the gst kicked in on april 1, which caused quite an uproar among consumers, prompting thecustoms department to announce that it was investigating the telcos for the price increase, saying that prices should have been maintained. to add to the confusion, deputy finance minister datuk ahmad also weighed in on the issue the following day and said there should be no change to the prices of the reload coupons as the 6% gst would merely replace the sales and service tax (sst), which is also at 6%. but the communications and multimedia consumer forum later affirmed that top-ups for prepaid mobile services are subject to gst. telcos also clarified that they had previously absorbed the sst on prepaid mobile users. on friday, the malaysian communications and multimedia commission issued a press statement confirming that gst will be imposed on prepaid reloads. however, to ease the burden on consumers and as a transitional measure, it said four major telcos, namely celcom axiata bhd, digi, maxis (fundamental: 1.15; valuation: 0.9) and umobile sdn bhd customers who reload rm5 and above will be given an additional value which is higher than the 6% gst in the form of free minutes and text messages for three months from april 3. a research analyst with a local bank said that the compromise is good news to telcos as the status quo of higher prices would likely stay at the end of three months. the solution is temporary and helps customers with the transition to higher costs. at the same time, mobile operators will still have the opportunity to pass on the cost of taxes to end users. plus, the additional 6% air time that they give to users may not may not be used by the customers. i think consumption patterns would be largely the same, he said. digi closed unchanged at rm6.33 last friday, with a market capitalisation of rm49.22 billion. maxis was up 1 sen at rm7.18, giving it a market capitalisation of rm53.9 billion. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers. a score of 3 suggests strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. go to www.theedgemarkets.com for more details on a companys financial dashboard.  this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on april 6, 2015."}, "321": {"date_posted": "6/4/2015", "title": "etiqa expects bourse to stabilise in 2h15", "article": "  kuala lumpur: maybank groups insurance and takaful arm etiqa takaful bhd expects the fbm klci to stabilise in the second half of 2015 (2h15), following a challenging first quarter, and set a year-end target of between 1,830 and 1,860 points for the benchmark index. norlia mat yusof , chief investment officer of etiqa, told the edge financial daily that etiqa adopts a bottom-up approach in picking investments amid the tough global environment, rather than selecting stocks by sectors. it is still a challenging year, but nevertheless, our strategy has always been the bottom-up approach. we look at the value of the stocks, the company, the management, and the potential. among etiqas stock picks are mitrajaya holdings bhd (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 1.8), its top small cap construction buy, and prolexus bhd (fundamental: 2.8; valuation: 1.8). these two stocks have recently been added to its funds. mitrajaya is cheap compared with its peers and under-researched with only one or two research houses actively covering the counter at the moment, norlia said, noting that mitrajayas management has consistently delivered on its guidance for the past two years. etiqa is overweight in the construction sector, expecting contract awards to remain strong in 2015, especially due to infrastructure projects including the klang valley mass rapid transit 2, light rail transit extensions and the west coast expressway. its other picks from the construction sector include gamuda bhd (fundamental: 2.2; valuation: 1.5) and ijm corp bhd (fundamental: 1.1; valuation: 1.2). for prolexus, norlia said the under-researched company is a partial beneficiary of the weak ringgit, as it is involved in the manu- facturing of garments for international sportswear companies such as nike. with greater health awareness and nike looking to grow its global market share, prolexus is capitalising on this trend by expanding its manufacturing capacity in china, she said. meanwhile, the current low oil price environment has had some effect on etiqas investments, as some of its funds do have exposure to oil and gas stocks. however, norlia said there is already some clarity of global oil prices, and she expects prices to stabilise around us$60 (rm217.20) per barrel. as far back as about five to six months ago, i am looking at the oil price to stabilise at around us$60 per barrel. i reckon the level will remain there for a few years, she said. etiqa has a line of investment-linked products, such as premiere value savers, dynamic invest and takaful smart link, which are provided by maybank, and also elitelink and takafulink distributed by etiqa itself. these products are linked to its funds, ranging from stable mandates to cater for investors with a lower risk appetite, to growth mandates for those willing to take higher risk. these products are linked to its funds, ranging from stable mandates which include its stable fund and premier income fund, for investors with a lower risk appetite, to growth mandates such as its growth fund and dana ekuiti prima for those willing to take higher risk. etiqa also offers balanced mandates, such as its balanced fund and the recently launched dana syariah seimbang. there is also the premier index fund, which consists of investments in klci component stocks. as at februry this year, etiqas funds had a total net asset value of rm2.05 billion. for its equity funds, norlia said the asset allocation can comprise up to 100% equities, or as low as 70% to 80% equities, with the balance to be invested in fixed income, including money market and deposits. for balanced funds, etiqa invests about 50% to 60% in equities, and the balance in fixed income, while the stable funds invest about 80% to 100% in fixed income. most of the funds ... have outperformed the benchmark in 2014. last year was a very challenging year, with the klci posting a negative return. however, our funds still registered positive returns, with the exception of the index fund, she said. on interest rates, norlia expects bank negara malaysia to maintain the overnight policy rate at the current 3.25% level. on the expected hike in interest rates by the us federal reserve, meanwhile, etiqa is forecasting a hike during the fed meeting in september this year. i think it is a concern, when [the hike] happens. it will influence more outflow of funds, back to the us. then again, when it happens, its something that we have to face, and we have to be prepared for a certain amount of outflow from malaysia to the us, she said. going forward, etiqa is looking at overseas investments outside of malaysia, including initial public offerings of companies in hong kong and australia. for hong kong, we believe the market is still depressed when compared to other global markets that have recovered back to record or multi-year highs, including the united states, united kingdom, germany and japan. as such, there should still be further upside to be unlocked, said norlia. as for australia, etiqa is seeking exposure to companies that are generally not available within the region, including upstream milk producers and consumer staples companies. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers. a score of 3 suggests strong fundamentals and attractive valuations.  this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on april 6, 2015."}, "322": {"date_posted": "3/4/2015", "title": "cmsb rises 4% on telco business venture", "article": " kuala lumpur (april 3): shares in cahya mata sarawak bhd (cmsb) rose as much as 18 sen or 4% in the morning trades after the group announced its plan to venture into the telecommunication infrastructure business. at 10.15am, cmsb (fundamental: 3.00;

transaction involving super shares. mcc is a public company traded on the nasdaq global market exchange with a market capitalisation of us$1.15 billion. in the announcement, mcc requires a due diligence exercise before it can proceed to the stage of making a definitive offer. supers board has agreed to mcc undertaking the due diligence exercise. looking at the most recent third quarter of financial year 2015 (3qfy15) result announcement, the group recorded a higher profit before taxation of rm4.2 million for the current quarter compared with the corresponding figure of rm1.8 million in 3qfy14. the improved profitability can be attributed to two operating segments, namely the labels segment and nameplates/in-mould decorating products segment. both these segments reported increased orders, effective cost control measures and forex gains as a result of the strong us dollar. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that no research house covers the stock. this stock currently trades at a low historical price-earnings ratio of 12.7 times while its price-to-book value ratio of 1.26 times indicates that its share price is trading at a minor premium to its book value. supers chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frame is very firmly up. its share price made a good surge since its major weekly wave-2 low of 97 sen in september 2013. since that 97 sen low, super surged to its march 2015 recent high of rm3.08. as prices broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of rm2.13 and rm2.56, look to buy super on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term uptrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) have issued buy signals and now depict very firm indications of supers eventual surge towards much higher levels. it would attract firm buying activities at the support levels of rm2.13, rm2.56 and rm2.91. we expect super to witness some

initial public offering (ipo) of 1mdbs energy arm would be able to pay for the companys growing debts amounting to rm13 billion debt in the energy sector. once the ipo is carried out, expected to be done by september as part of the consolidation efforts undertaken by 1mdb, the cash flow problem is expected to be addressed. this is on top of the other options including monetisation through the selling of its assets (land). the other option includes joint-venture initiatives, ahmad husni said. the proposed ipo of edra has been delayed several times due to a longer-than-expected due diligence process and debt refinancing negotiations. according to documents viewed by the edge weekly, the original plan was that edras parent 1mdb, would offer for sale 1.1 billion shares in the energy outfit at rm1.83 apiece, which would garner the strategic investment fund some rm2 billion. meanwhile, edra itself would issue in excess of three billion new shares, raising close to rm5.5 billion for the company. in total, some 4.81 billion shares were expected to be sold in the ipo, which at rm1.83 apiece, works out to rm8.81 billion, the edge weekly reported in december last year. initial indications were that 1mdb would retain only 20% of edra, with the bulk of the funds it obtained from the ipo to be used to repay its borrowings. cimb shares closed two sen higher at rm6.24 yesterday,

southeast asian banks today using its software and services, singapore-listed silverlake axis ltd is now vying for the top position in the asia-pacific  and it is confident of achieving it. silverlake (fundamental: 3; valuation: 2.1) was founded by malaysian goh peng ooi and is a provider of digital economy solutions and services for its clients in the banking, insurance, payment, retail and logistics industries. he said the group has been ahead of competitors in what he calls the flow of time wherein companies evolve from being technology-based to information-based, followed by capability and subsequently intelligence. right from the start our end point is intelligence. we have worked on it for 27 years. we have a winning formula, im not surprised if the group quantum leaps again, goh, the group executive chairman of silverlake, said in an exclusive interview. silverlake is a leading software provider to the banking sector in malaysia, singapore, indonesia, thailand, the philippines and vietnam. in fact, he does not discount the group penetrating europe and the united states at some point in the future. last december, silverlake acquired finzsoft solutions ltd, a software development company based in new zealand and listed on the new zealand stock exchange. there are strong synergies between silverlake and finzsofts products and solutions, and a natural alignment of target customers in the asia-pacific region being tier-1 banks, said dr raymond kwong, silverlake chief executive officer and group managing director. finzsoft had last year fully acquired sush mobile, which develops end-to-end mobile solutions, and specialising in applications for businesses primarily in the enterprise space. kwong does not discount any future acquisitions with good recurring income, which could add value to its customers digital economy businesses. note that silverlake was in a net cash position of rm334.3 million as at dec 31 last year, after deducting borrowings of rm3.16 million. from 2010 to 2014, silverlake made acquisitions to broaden its suite of software solutions and service offerings. during the same period, it registered a compound annual growth rate (cagr) of close to 30% for its revenue and 40% for its net profit. over the medium to long term, kwong said silverlakes earnings will grow at the mid-teens level  in line with revenue growth. for the first half of financial year 2015 ended december 2014 (1hfy15), silverlake registered slower revenue growth although profit rose at a faster pace and margins expanded. but this raised concerns among analysts of the lack of major sizeable order wins that may limit future earnings growth. but the software giant is unperturbed, and is determined to continue its focus on its two main business segments  software licensing, and maintenance and enhancement services  which rake in higher margins. silverlakes business is based on quality recurring income. during 1hfy15, we had a better mix of higher margin revenues which resulted in higher profit growth over revenue. we will continue to focus on growing the higher quality earnings segments of our business, kwong said. for 1hfy15, software licensing as well as maintenance and enhancement services were the only segments that reported an increase in revenue  of 26% and 21%, respectively. the former accounted for 30% of group revenue and the latter 51%. kwong said these segments are expected to continue to have a healthy level of growth, and offer margins double to triple those of project services. over the medium to long term, we are well-positioned and target to grow our core revenue cagr at the mid-teens level, kwong said. he declined to comment on the prospects of other segments, such as software project services, sale of software and hardware products, credit and cards processing, and insurance processing  all of which saw a drop in revenue. these four segments accounted for 19% of group revenue in 1hfy15. for 1hfy15, net profit grew 18% to rm131.3 million while revenue rose 6% to rm240.9 million. as a result, gross profit margin improved to 66% from 60%, while net profit margin rose to 58%, from 49%. silverlake saw a record year in fy14, as its revenue hit a high of rm500.7 million and net profit rm248.9 million. cimb research has a reduce call on silverlake with target price of s$0.99 (rm2.655). silverlake continues to have a rich valuation in our view, trading at 27.6 times forward price-earnings ratio, above comparable peers average of 19.7 times, said phillip capital, who also has a reduce call with a target price of s$1.16. uob kay hian in a feb 13 note said silverlakes dividend payout ratio of 90% is expected to be sustainable, and dividend yields of 3.4% to 4.6% in fy15 to fy17 seem decent. it maintained a buy on the counter with a target price of s$1.66. given the jumpy nature of orders, it would not be surprising to see marginal volatility in revenue year-on-year. however, beyond the short-term order book fluctuations, silverlakes backlog of orders and its stable business model would allow the group to steer through revenue volatility, said analyst bennett lee. meanwhile, maybank kim eng is of the view that silverlake will benefit from the weakening ringgit, as it generates revenue largely in singapore dollars and us dollars while costs are mainly denominated in ringgit. the research house maintained its buy call on the stock with a target price of s$1.40. silverlake closed at s$1.36 last friday, giving it a market capitalisation of s$3.042

the ringgit was marginally firmer against the us dollar at 3.6620 as brent crude oil remained slightly firmer at us$56.37 (rm206.87) per barrel. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to its 1,896.23 all-time high (july 2014) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since july 2014 had key swings of 1,837.28 (low), 1,879.62 (high), 1,766.22 (low), 1,858.09 (high), 1,671.82 (low), 1,810.21 (high), 1,706.18 (low), 1,831.41 (high) and 1,774.30 (low). all the indexs daily signals are marginally positive for now, with its cci, dmi, macd, oscillator and stochastic indicators showing upbeat readings. as such, the indexs obvious support levels are seen at 1,774, 1,800 and 1,818, while the resistance areas of 1,823, 1,831 and 1,896 will cap any index rebound. the klcis 18 and 40 simple moving averages (sma) depict an emerging uptrend for its daily chart. however, the price bars of the index are now between the 50 and 200 sma and remained neutral on that front. the recent fall from its all-time high of 1,896.23 saw a trough at 1,671.82. the price rebound from 1,671.82 stalled at 1,831.41 (on feb 4) and remains below the 200-sma line of 1,822.81. due to the rebound tone for the klci, we are recommending a chart buy on ccm duopharma biotech bhd (ccmdbio). the stock rose sharply over the past fortnight after posting a strong set of quarterly results. looking at the most recent fourth quarter of financial year 2014 (4qfy14) results announcement, the group recorded an increase of 8.9% year-on-year to rm176.9 million from rm162.4 million in 4qfy13. correspondingly, profit-before-tax also rose by about 15.7% in 4qfy14 from rm40.2 million to rm46.5 million. the stronger profitability can be attributed to the increased demand from government hospitals. further to the results announcement, ccmdbio highlighted that demand in the pharmaceutical industry is expected to remain stable due to the defensive nature of the industry. however, demand may fluctuate especially for supply to government hospitals via the tender process. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that no research house covers the stock. ccmdbio currently trades at a fair historical price-earnings ratio of 14.8 times. its price-to-book value ratio of 2.72 times indicates that its share price is trading at a steep premium to its book value. it gives a high dividend yield of 4.9%. ccmdbios chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly up. its share price has made a good surge since its major monthly wave-2 low of rm1.24 in october 2008. since that rm1.28 low, ccmdbio surged to its march 2015 recent all-time high of rm3.84. as prices broke above their recent key critical resistance levels of rm3.33 and rm3.37, look to buy ccmdbio on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term uptrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, stochastic and oscillator) have issued buy signals and now depict very firm indications of ccmdbios eventual move towards much higher levels. it would attract firm buying activities at the support levels of rm3.33, rm3.37 and rm3.80. we expect ccmdbio to witness some profit-taking at its resistance and all-time high of rm3.84. its upside targets are located at rm3.88, rm4.63, rm4.98, rm5.22 and rm6.20. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed in the article are the opinions of the writer

first month of 2015, johor-based builder kimlun corp bhd had already secured five projects, which are collectively worth rm422.2 million or 1.56 times the size of construction jobs it secured in 2014. however, investors and analysts remain unexcited aboutthe counter. there hasnt been much effect on the share price of kimlun (fundamental: 1.30; valuation: 2.40), which raises the question of whether the stock is undervalued. nevertheless, the new contract wins are expected to contribute positively to the groups earnings for the next three years. in three contracts with a total value of rm144.5 million, kimlun will construct apartments, houses and factories forunited malayan land bhd (uml). it will also build affordable apartments for uem sunrise bhd and undertake infrastructure works for the southern industrial and logistics cluster for uem land bhd, in jobs worth rm230.7 million and rm47 million respectively. it is worth noting that kimlun only clinched rm270 million worth of contracts last year, which was one-fourth of the new building jobs secured in 2013 of more than rm1 billion. although the job flow has started to pick up, kimlun has failed to appeal to analysts who track it. maybank investment bank bhd, kenanga research, hong leong investment bank bhd (hlib) and amresearch have rated the counter as underperform or hold. kimluns share price fell 46 sen or 26%, down from a 52-week high of rm1.75 on april 14, 2014, to settle at rm1.29 last thursday. year to date, the stock is up by 10 sen or 8.4%. kimlunceo and executive director sim tian liang tells the edge that apart from the new order wins, analysts also consider the groups construction margins and the sustainability of its order book. this is how the analysts think about us. basically, i think they hold negative views about the property market. [so,] when there is a slowdown in the property market, naturally they would expect our order book to be affected, he says, adding that the company is now mostly working on private jobs, which account for a major portion of its construction orders. according to amresearch analystmaxkoh, the market remains sceptical due to the diminishing margins over the years as well as the general slowdown in construction activities in johor. kimlun expects its gross construction margin to shrink to 6% this year compared with 11% in the financial year ended dec 31, 2011 (fy2011). koh, however, acknowledges that the rm422 million new job wins are encouraging as the group has been bidding for jobs more actively this year. the research househas a new order book assumption of rm600 million in 2015 for kimlun, and an outstanding order book estimation of rm1.4 billion. meanwhile, kenanga research analyst mohd iqbal zainal says investors are waiting for consistent earnings delivery from the company. recall that kimluns earnings came in below expectations in previous quarters due to weaker margins. nowadays, it may not be enough if you have a fat order book. investors like to see the company delivering sustainable and stable earnings, he says. for this year, iqbal forecasts rm500 million in new contracts for kimlun, and estimates the current outstanding order book atrm1.6 billion. we maintain our numbers for now. however, should kimlun surpass our new job assumptions, we may revise our order book replenishment, but earnings revision is subject to the groups ability to earn decent margins in the coming quarters, he says. hlib, on the other hand, views the new contracts as merely making up for last years lacklustre job wins. as at dec 31, 2014, kimlun had an estimated construction and manufacturing balance order book of rm1.19 billion and rm230 million respectively. it reported a lower net profit of rm9.15 million in 4qfy2014, down 28.6% from rm12.81 million a year ago, no thanks to the larger tax incentives recognised in 4qfy2013. for fy2014, its net profit grew 26% to rm45.09 million, up from rm35.72 million in fy2013. the company declared a final single-tier dividend of 3.8 sen per share. interestingly, kimlun executive chairman pang tin has been accumulating shares on the open market. as at jan 15, he owned a 40.96% stake in the company, up from 40.217%

last week may be a catalyst for investors to start building their confidence in bursa malaysia, whose performance is lagging behind other markets. the lower prices may attract investors. momentum has started to build up. the rsi and momentum oscillator indicators are above the mid-levels and the macd indicator is above its moving average. the klci is also above the middle band of the bollinger

level, and with the current market environment and technical indications, there is a high possibility for the index to break above the resistance level and climb higher. with that breakout, the index can even climb to historical highs. however, if the market environment changes negatively, the trend may not be able to stay bullish. henceforth, i am expecting the klci to stay bullish if it can stay

in the doldrums", "article": " looking at the results of some of the bigger listed plantation players, especially those with downstream exposure, the sectors latest reporting season is likely to disappoint. while this is largely anticipated, the outlook for the sector is looking dim as well. in their financials for the quarter ended dec 31, 2014, plantation giants ioi corp bhd and kuala lumpur kepong bhd showed margin compression due mainly to lower average selling prices. crude palm oil (cpo) prices lost as much as 33% last year to close at rm1,929 per tonne at the end of august from rm2,885 in march, bringing the average price for 2014 to about rm2,400 per tonne. early this month, however, the commodity recovered some 9% to rm2,300 per tonne. prices never quite got the much-needed boost last year from a potential el niu00f1o, which would have curtailed production. in its second quarter ended dec 31, 2014, ioi corp (fundamental: 1.7; valuation: 2.1) saw net profit tumble 96% to rm19.6 million from a year ago on the back of a slight decrease in revenue to rm2.88 billion from rm2.94 billion previously. klks (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 0.7) net profit for the quarter dipped as well  to rm214.2 million from rm292.68 million the year before  although revenue rose to rm3.1 billion from rm2.49 billion in 2013. plantation [pre-tax] profit dropped 5.7% [year on year] to rm242.1 million due mainly to the weaker selling prices of cpo and rubber, reduced crop production of both fresh fruit bunches (ffb) and rubber, and higher production cost of cpo, klk says in a filing with bursa malaysia. its average selling price for cpo fell 6.8% year on year to rm2,138 per tonne while that of ioi corp contracted 9.7% to rm2,187. ioi corp said its plantation profit decreased 4% y-o-y to rm297.3 million during the quarter, due mainly to lower cpo and palm kernel oil prices. its downstream segment was also hit hard, declining 19% y-o-y to rm215 million on lower margins from the oleochemical subsector. the company also saw huge foreign exchange translation losses of rm274 million mainly from us dollar denominated debt. this pattern will follow across the board this reporting season for all plantation counters exposed to downstream operations and us dollar denominated debt because of the way the ringgit has depreciated against the us dollar, says an analyst with an international banking institution. note that unrealised forex translation losses are not actual cash transactions but are reflected in the profit and loss account as a result of fluctuating currencies, like in ioi corps case. the downstream players will be worst hit because their inventories must be marked-to-market and this will reflect lower cpo prices, says the analyst. but this is not to say the upstream players are insulated. they too suffer a direct impact from cpo price changes. maybank investment bank research points out in a feb 13 report that while zero cpo export duty has benefited the upstream players (with no export taxes), it has been a bane for refiners in the region that are suffering from overcapacity. malaysia has 58 operating refineries worth rm2.9 billion, according to the palm oil refiners association of malaysia (poram). the biggest refiners include ioi corp, felda global ventures holdings bhd, mewah international inc and wilmar international ltd. as it is, many refiners in malaysia have been in negative margin territory for almost half a year now, says poram chief executive mohammad jaaffar ahmad. this is because the government decided to suspend export duty on cpo in september 2014. following the slight recovery in cpo prices early this month, the market was expecting the tax to resume in march. but the government has since announced that march will remain duty free as the average price has yet to exceed the rm2,250 threshold. for as long as there is no export tax on cpo, refiners will generally suffer negative margins as the price differential between refined palm oil and cpo is currently insufficient to cover costs. as long as the price of cpo is below the threshold price of rm2,250, there should be zero cpo export tax, jaaffar tells the edge. based on the current price trend, futures market, stock levels, market demand and stock levels in importing countries, plus parameters beyond our control, such as the overhanging high production and stock of other vegetable oils and depressed crude oil prices, we see the price of cpo subdued in the first quarter of 2015. this will be reflected in the next reporting season, he adds. jaafar is not the only one forecasting lacklustre prices. we forecast cpo prices to average rm2,100 in 2015 after taking into account the weaker ringgit, says insider asia. we expect single-digit earnings contraction for the sector as a whole this year with output growth partially offsetting the price decline. this seems to be at the lower end of expectations with some analysts keeping cpo price forecasts as high as rm2,650. im waiting for the indonesian biodiesel mandate to be confirmed and planting intentions of the us at the end of march before adjusting the price forecast. it is still too early to tell, says an analyst. the indonesian government recently raised its subsidy for biodiesel to idr4,000 per litre from idr1,500 to support biodiesel usage amidst the decline in crude oil prices. crude oil prices have more than halved since august 2014, making biodiesel blends less competitive in contrast. if the government has strong willpower, then the economics of crude oil to biodiesel blending may not be as important a factor as cpo prices, cimb research analyst ivy ng says. but she notes that at the present crude oil prices, subsidies are required to keep biodiesel in demand. despite the expectation of slightly lower production in malaysia on the back of floods in december, palm oil stocks came in at 2.015 million tonnes in 2014 compared with 1.987 million tonnes in 2013. that said, forecasters are expecting inventory levels to come off this year  conventionally, a boon for prices. but one must take into account the bumper soybean crop in the us, which was estimated at 4 billion bushels last year. that is forecast to grow 11% this year, says the analyst with the international bank. all things considered, it is not easy to see light at the end of the tunnel for the plantation sector.  note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on

income  it allocates over 40% of its rm600 billion asset base to stock markets in malaysia and overseas. just five years ago, its allocation and income from equities were about 27% to 28%. meanwhile, 68% of its funds were invested in government debt papers and highly rated corporate loans that brought in slightly over two-thirds of the total gross investment income it used for dividend payment. today, more than half of the epfs assets are still in these highly rated debt papers, but returns have fallen below 40% due to yield compression. that the 6.75% dividend the retirement fund declared for 2014 was 3.59% above inflation  as well as more than double the 12-month fixed deposit rate of 3.21% and well above the 3.84% yield for five-year malaysian government securities  is a testament to the reallocation in recent years. the dividend for 2014 is also up for a sixth straight year compared with 4.5% in 2008 and 5.65% in 2009 when rm100.43 billion (27.05% of its asset base) was invested in equities versus rm269.63 billion (42.35%) last year. income from equities has grown even stronger from rm4.9 billion (28.37% of total gross investment income) to rm22.91 billion (58.63%) last year. some observers are concerned that the epf  tasked with growing retirement savings for malaysias private wage earners  could be hit should the equities market take a sudden turn. but ceo datuk shahril ridza ridzuan says short-term price volatility does not matter to long-term value investors like the fund because the intrinsic value of the shares does not change with the price fluctuation. the job of the epf is actually to find value, the right assets or stocks that are underpriced on a long-term view because we believe prices will eventually reflect their value. were not a short-term investor, shahril tells the edge. the epf had some rm146.4 billion, or 23% of its rm636.53 billion investment asset base as at end-2014, in overseas assets but does not give a breakdown of how much of it is in foreign equities. nonetheless, shahril says the epfs top foreign stock holdings are blue chips. partly to allay concerns over the rise in its equities investment, the retirement fund makes a quarterly disclosure of its top 30 holdings of local equities on its website. these were estimated to be worth rm111.61 billion as at end-2014, being 41.4% of the rm269.63 billion the epf had invested in local and foreign equities at the end of last year. the same top 30 holdings would be worth a little more at about rm114.3 billion using feb 16, 2015, prices. to illustrate the funds dominance in the local market, the estimated size of its top 30 equities holdings was 6.76% of bursa malaysias total market capitalisation of rm1.65 trillion as at dec 31, 2014. its entire fund size of rm636.5 billion is over 37% of bursas total market capitalisation of rm1.71 trillion currently. given its size and the returns the epf has generated from equities, its investment moves might be worth watching. the fund does not comment on individual equity investments. among other things, the fund is believed to have been relatively early in exiting its investment in malaysian airline system bhd (mas). as at end-march 2010, about the time mas announced plans for a rm3.05 billion one-for-one rights issue, the epf had a 13.66% stake in the airline and this was its 25th largest equity investment by percentage holdings. by september the same year, the stake had fallen to 13% and by december 2010, mas was no longer among the funds top 30 equity holdings. on hindsight, that saved it from having to fork out more money when the national carrier announced its third rights issue in five years in november 2012 that sought to raise rm3 billion. however, not all its holdings have performed well. its investment in shell refining co (federation of malaya) bhd, for instance, has fallen in value. closing at rm5.45 apiece on feb 16, shells share price has slipped from rm8.25 as at end-2012 and rm6.36 as at end-2013, but has recovered from the rm4.69 seen at end-2014. the epf has been slowly paring its holdings in shell, from 17.02% at end-2012 to 16.75% at end-2013 and 16.55% at end-2014. latest filings show that the epf had 16.49% equity interest as at feb 11, 2015. fortunately, while shell is shown as number four on the epfs top 30 equity holdings as at end-2014, the value of the stake is relatively small at only rm233 million. in terms of the value of the shares on the funds top 30 holdings as at end-2014, its most valuable stake was its 13.32% in malayan banking bhd, followed closely by its 14.37% in tenaga nasional bhd and 14.7% in public bank bhd. each of these holdings are worth over rm10 billion. a closer look at the disclosures found that during 2014, the funds largest equity holding increases were at telekom malaysia bhd (up 3.11% to 14.73% as at end-2014), tenaga (up 2.01% to 14.37%), ijm corp bhd (up 2.46% to 13.02%), pos malaysia bhd (up 2.13% to 11.53%) and capitamalls malaysia trust (up 2.18% to 11.25%) (see table). apart from pos malaysia, whose shares fell 14.08% year on year in 2014, the other four stocks all ended the year between 8.84% and 29.04% higher, with telekom being the best performer. interestingly, the epf chose to reduce some of its holdings in another telecoms counter, digi.com bhd, by 1.12% to 13.27% at end-2014, even as it raised its equity in telekom. over the same 12-month period, among the epfs larger stake sales were ijm plantations bhd (down 3.52% to 12.04% as at end-2014), petronas gas bhd (down 1.47% to 12%), mbm resources bhd (down 1.4% to 14.46%), cimb group holdings bhd (down 1.28% to 14.6%) and petronas chemicals group bhd (down 1.28% to 11%). four of the five stocks that the epf sold saw their respective share prices fall between 5.46% and 25% while shares of ijm plantations rose 3.92% for the year. but the year-on-year gains may not be reflective of the epfs gains or losses given that its entry and exit costs could differ from the stocks general trend for 2014. time will tell if investors can profit from tracking the epfs moves, but it may be worth putting stock in the ceos perspective that price fluctuations do not change the real value of the shares.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on february 23 - 29, 2015."}, "335": {"date_posted": "12/3/2015", "title":

2014 was nothing to rave about and likely led to tepid overall growth for the full year. analysts are, however, more optimistic about the outlook for corporate earnings growth this year. most are projecting high-end single-digit growth for 2015, with the more confident forecasting double-digit growth.  this may lift investor confidence somewhat, considering that the latest financial reporting season may not have lived up to expectations. many had been keeping a close watch on the fourth-quarter results, which concluded last week, as a gauge of how companies would fare amid what was seen as a tougher economic and operating environment. interestingly though, official data showed that gross domestic product growth had actually improved to 5.8% in the final quarter of 2014, compared with 5.6% in the third quarter. prices of commodities declined last year, most notably crude oil prices. crude oil lost nearly half its value to us$60 to us$70 per barrel  at its lowest, it was just under us$60, in the fourth quarter  from a high of above us$100 in june. similarly, crude palm oil (cpo) prices also dropped to rm2,100 to rm2,200 per tonne due in part to extensive floods in the east coast. the plunge in crude oil prices had sent the benchmark fbm klci, which shed 5.66% last year, crashing to a low of 1,673.94 on dec 16 as oil and gas stocks took a beating. the index closed at 1,820.87 points last thursday. to aggravate matters further, the ringgit has weakened to around 3.50 to the us dollar as the greenback reflected broader strength against most emerging-market currencies on signs of an improving us economy. bimb securities head of research kenny yee expects corporate earnings this year to grow 8% to 9% after a likely contraction of 0.6% last year, while uob kay hian head of research vincent khoo anticipates 10% to 11% earnings growth this year after a probable expansion of between 2% and 3% last year. for 1q2015 and the rest of 2015, fluctuations in commodity prices, the us dollar/ringgit rate and, to a smaller extent, the temporary cut in electricity tariffs will have a bearing on earnings outlook. while we anticipate some earnings downside to our aggregate earnings growth of around 10% to 11% in 2015 (at the start of the year), we still expect better growth compared with 2014s depressed level, khoo tells the edge via email. yee, meanwhile, expects the equities market to perform better than last year. from the fbm klci perspective, core earnings of index-linked stocks are expected to grow 8.8%, says an analyst from maybank investment bank research. jf apex securities head of research lee chung cheng, however, expects a lower earnings growth of 5% to 6% this year. analysts say earnings growth this year will be largely underpinned by the banking, telecommunications (telecoms), export and utility sectors. the banking industry will be a key sector, given the reasonable analyst consensus forecast of bank earnings, says yee. he believes that since the sector has the highest weightage in the broad market and the fbm klci, it will drive earnings growth this year. nevertheless, the maybank ib analyst cautions that the banking sector may face pressure on margins due to intense competition and a weaker outlook. on the telecoms sector, he says it is a steady market, given the solid balance sheets of the players. their ability to come up with package deals should see earnings growth, especially from the data segment, provided margins remain intact. he adds that the ability to pass on the cost of the goods and services tax (gst) to the end consumer is a positive factor for telecoms players. the telecoms sector is a beneficiary of the gst. we expect it to report double-digit earnings growth. uob kay hians khoo says the ringgits weakness against the us dollar will continue to benefit exporters, particularly electrical and electronic (e&e), glove-making and flexible plastic packaging companies. he cites kossan rubber industries bhd (fundamental: 2.1; valuation: 0.3) and carlsberg brewery malaysia bhd (fundamental: 2.3; valuation: 2.1) as currency winners. etiqa insurance & takaful head of research chris eng believes e&e firms could be a positive surprise. these companies are beneficiaries of the strong greenback and higher demand for white goods (heavy consumer durables such as refrigerators and air conditioners), he tells the edge over the telephone. despite the electricity tariff reduction announced early last month, analysts continue to favour the utility sector, particularly tenaga nasional bhd (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.8). the government has announced a 5.8% or 2.25 sen per kwh electricity tariff reduction for peninsular malaysia. this will come into effect between march 1 and june 30. tariffs in sabah will also be reduced by 3.5% or 1.2 sen per kwh in the same period. eng says tenaga is likely to perform well despite the temporary rebate. he adds that it will be netted off against the reversals from the over-recovery of tenagas fuel costs. tenaga still has a strong core net profit. so, it is not an issue. over the long term, yee says tenaga will benefit from lower fuel costs and capacity expansion in excess of 1,000mw. revision in tariff is only a short-term knee-jerk reaction, as we believe in the longer run. on the whole, rhb research institute head of research alexander chia says companies with expanded capacity will be instrumental in bringing about earnings growth.\ncapital expenditure investment in new capacity is largely completed, therefore, new facilities are beginning to contribute new revenue, he says, citing examples of hartalega holdings bhd (fundamental: 2.6; valuation: 0.3), hovid bhd (fundamental: 2.1; valuation: 0.3) and cahya mata sarawak bhd (fundamental: 3.0; valuation: 1.5). sectors that may underperform this year include plantation and property. these two sectors could see some downside risks due to the lack of growth drivers, says chia. bimbs yee says the less efficient plantation companies are most likely to find it tough, given market pressure capping cpo prices. so long as cpo prices remain at current levels, maintaining margins is of utmost importance. he says developers offering properties in less alluring locations may suffer from selective demand, given that loans are more restrictive now. uob kay hians khoo notes that there could be pockets of mild downside risk this year for some companies due to situational triggers. umw holdings bhd (fundamental: 2.2; valuation: 1.2) could be a loser of a weaker ringgit due to us dollar-denominated costs in its automotive division, and axiata group bhd (fundamental: 0.85; valuation: 0.9) for poor underlying performance at its indonesian telecoms business and foreign exchange losses. genting malaysia bhd (fundamental: 2.4; valuation: 0.6) would incorporate one-off costs related to its failed new york casino bid. he notes that cimb group holdings bhd (fundamental: 1.35; valuation: 2.1) is also a potential loser amid a likely spike in credit costs, moderating loans growth, funding cost pressures and continued weakness in investment banking deal flows. the oil and gas sector, which has been snagging headlines since the second half of last year, will continue to be in the spotlight this year as the market will diligently track crude oil prices, chia opines. much depends on where oil prices are heading  if they make a reversal and go down again, the market will head downwards as a result, he says. lower crude oil prices will

valuation: 1.80) since jan 9 this year, succeeded amirul feisal wan zahir, who is now heading the global banking division at malayan banking bhd. last week, ccm announced a net loss of rm43.85 million for its financial year 2014 ended december, (fy14), compared with a net profit of rm647,000 a year ago. revenue slipped 15.5% to rm1.09 billion, from rm1.29 billion in fy13. on a segmental basis, profit at ccms pharmaceutical division grew 12.2% to rm34.6 million while earnings at the chemicals division slid 7.8% to rm15.3 million on lower sales. the groups fertilisers division continued to bleed, with losses widening by nearly five times to rm59.8 million. during the year, ccm closed its manufacturing plant in indonesia, incurring an impairment loss of rm36.8 million. in fy14, the fertiliser business contributed 44.9% to the groups total revenue, followed by the pharmaceutical division (29%) and chemical segment (25.9%). leonard said the pharmaceutical business commands a profit margin of 40%; the chemical business 20% and the fertiliser business a single-digit percentage profit margin. leonard said the fertiliser business is currently the sore thumb within ccm, with plant utilization hovering between 30% and 40% in lahad datu, sabah. my assessment of the fertiliser business is that the market has changed quite substantially. fertiliser manufacturing has the smallest value-add to the final product, while variable cost is almost at 80% to 85%. you could say that ccm did not predict the change in the past, and now [it is up to us] to restructure the division back to profitability, he said. he noted that the stronger us dollar also poses a challenge for the turnaround of the fertiliser division, as most of its raw materials are sourced in the currency. we dont take a hedging position but we lock our prices beforehand, normally on a one year forward contract. we hope the reduction in electricity tariffs (effective march 1, 2015) will buffer the foreign exchange impact on the purchase of raw materials in us dollars, said leonard. as for its chemicals division, leonard said the group will focus on growing its polymer coatings segment and chloralkali business. ccms polymer coating business caters to surgical glove manufacturers in malaysia, thailand and indonesia. it plans to expand to china, vietnam and sri lanka. meanwhile, leonard said the groups 73.37%-subsidiary ccm duopharma biotech bhd (ccmd) will grow the pharmaceutical business through identification of new pipelines, which consist of new products in biotherapeutics and niche therapeutic areas, as well as regional expansion via acquisition strategies. last november, ccm had announced that it will be disposing of its pharmaceutical assets to ccmd (fundamental: 2.6; valuation: 2.10) for rm133.33 million cash. we believe the disposal of the pharmaceutical business will provide ccmd with immediate access to capacity which it needs. if ccmd were to start from scratch, it would have taken at least another 36 months before the new plant can be operated, he said, adding that he will continue to steer ccmd for the time being. on capital expenditure, leonard said ccm has budgeted rm50 million this year, of which rm20 million has been allocated to the pharmaceutical division, followed by its chemical division (rm20 million) and fertiliser division (rm10 million). as for its expansion strategy, leonard said ccm targets to acquire pharmaceutical manufacturing companies in the asean region. as at march 31, 2014, ccms largest shareholder was permodalan nasional bhd with a 71.35% stake. the stock rose 3 sen or 3.16% to close at 98 sen last friday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm431.90 million. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers. a score of 3 suggests strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. go to www.theedgemarkets.com for more details on a companys financial dashboard.  this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on march 9, 2015."}, "342": {"date_posted": "3/3/2015", "title": "klci edges up but gains seen limited", "article": " kuala lumpur (march 3): the fbm klci edged up in early trade in line with the firmer regional markets but the gains at the local bourse were seen limited. at 9am, the fbm klci rose 3.30 points to 1,820.43. the top gainers included kuala lumpur kepong bhd, the nomad group bhd, petronas gas bhd, umw holdings bhd, dayang enterprise holdings bhd, tenaga nasional bhd, c.i. holding bhd,malayan banking bhd, ioi corporation bhd, dutch lady milk industries bhd and pestech international bhd. at the global markets, the u.s. dollar hovered close to an 11-year high against a basket of currencies while asian shares firmed in early trade on tuesday, with sentiment bolstered by another record day on wall street, according to reuters. msci's broadest index of asia-pacific shares outside japan was nearly flat, while japan's nikkei stock average was up about 0.4 percent after the yen pushed to three-week lows against the greenback, it said. hong leong ib research in a market preview tuesday said despite positive overseas markets, domestic concerns such as potential more 2015 earnings downgrade, depressed ringgit coupled with nagging concern over imdb saga would cap the fbm klcis upside. stiff resistances are 1830-1850 while supports fall on 1790-1800, it said.

quarter of financial year 2015 (2qfy15) results recently on feb 12, 2015. looking at the 2qfy15 results announcement, latitud recorded a minor revenue growth of 0.9% from rm361.5 million in 2qfy14 to rm364.8 million in this quarter. correspondingly, profit before tax rose 2.4% from rm46.8 million in 2qfy14 to rm47.9 million in 2qfy15. a higher unrealised foreign exchange gain arising from translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies aided the small improvement in profitability. latitud also pointed out that its group operation is seasonal in nature. its turnover for the first three months of a calendar year is usually slightly lower after the long festive year-end christmas and new year holidays. a check on the bloomberg consensus reveals that no research house covers latitud. this stock currently trades at a very low and reasonable price-earnings ratio of 8.98 times while its price-to-book ratio of 1.60 times indicates that its share price is trading at a minor premium to its book value. latituds chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly up. its share price made a good surge since its minor weekly wave-2 low of 78 sen in august 2013. since that 78 sen low, latitud surged to its february 2015 recent all-time high of rm6.08. as prices broke below its recent key critical resistance levels of rm4.67 and rm5.30, look to buy latitud on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term uptrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) have issued buy signals and now depict very firm indications of latituds eventual move towards much higher levels. it would attract firm buying activities at the support levels of rm4.67, rm5.30 and rm6.07. we expect latitud to witness some profit-taking at its resistance and all-time high of rm6.08. its upside targets are located at rm6.18, rm6.80, rm7.64 and rm8.80.

(fundamental score: 1.3; valuation score: 1.8) said its net operating profit for 4qfy14 fell 9% to rm109.8 million, due to higher finance costs relating to bank borrowings, as the airline took delivery of new aircraft, as well as to finance its new airasia headquarters at klia2 in sepang. revenue however, climbed 15.8% to rm1.48 billion, from rm1.28 billion in 4qfy13, which it said was because of double-digit growth in both average fare and ancillary income per passenger, which increased 13% and 31% year-on-year respectively. the poor quarterly results dragged airasia's net profit for the full financial year ended dec 31, 2014 (fy14) down 77.1% to rm82.84 million, from rm362.12 million the previous year, despite its revenue climbing 5.9% to rm5.42 billion, from rm5.11 billion

share in the previous corresponding period, on the back of higher operating costs and taxation. its revenue during the quarter under review, however, was up 5.96% on-year to rm3.16 billion, from rm2.98 billion, due to higher contributions from its internet and multimedia and data services, its filing today with bursa malaysia, showed. telekom proposed a final dividend of 13.4 sen per share, subject to shareholders' approval at its forthcoming annual general meeting. for its full fy14, telekom's net profit was at rm831.81 million, a decline of 17.82% from rm1.01 billion in fy13  also due to higher operating costs and tax charge  even though revenue came in 5.71% higher at rm11.24 billion, compared to rm10.63 billion previuosly. similarly, telekom said the higher revenue was achieved on the back of higher revenue from internet and multimedia, data and other telecommunication-related services, which was partially offset by lower contribution from voice and non-telecommunication-related services. malayan banking bhds net profit in the fourth quarter ended dec 31, 2014 (4qfy14), increased 12% to rm1.93 billion, from rm1.73 billion a year earlier, on

2014 (3qfy14) results at the end of november 2014 and its 4qfy14 results could be released in later this month. looking at the 3qfy14 results announcement, yeelee recorded revenue growth of 5% in the quarter but saw its profit before tax falling 23%. according to yeelee, the poor profitability was due to lower contributions from the manufacturing and trading divisions.  overall, the fundamentals for yeelee appeared to be unfavourable and the termination of its distribution agreement with red bull asia fze in early january 2015 had little effect. this suggests that the market had already priced in the negative news. despite its poorer results for the previous quarter, investors continued to show a keen interest in the stock. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that two research houses cover yeelee with two buy calls. this stock currently trades at a low price-earnings ratio of 10.2 times while its price-to-book ratio of 0.92 times indicates that its share price is trading at a minor discount to its book value. yeelees chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly up. its share price made a good surge since its major daily wave-5 low of rm1.24 in december 2014. since that rm1.24 low, yeelee surged to its february 2015 recent high of rm1.77. as prices broke below its recent key critical resistance levels of rm1.45 and rm1.58, look to buy yeelee on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to long-term uptrends for this stock. the daily and weekly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) have issued buy signals and now depict very firm indications of yeelees eventual move towards much higher levels. it would attract firm buying activities at the support levels of rm1.45, rm1.58 and rm1.77.

"11/2/2015", "title": "weak demand dynamics could stall cpo rally", "article": " crude palm oil (cpo) prices have enjoyed a resurgence as of late. after bottoming out at just above rm1,900 per tonne back in september, settlement prices have crept back up to rm2,345.50 as at jan 14, according to data provided by the malaysian palm oil board (mpob). similarly, the benchmark april 2015 forward active contract for cpo closed at rm2,344 on jan 15, marking a 11% increase since dec 1 (see chart). in spite of the gains, experts are saying that the current rally may be a temporary spike as overall fundamentals have not changed, or more worryingly, may have worsened over the past two months. at present, cpo prices are seeing strong support due to a decline in production. mpobs latest industry data for december shows a 22% fall in total output to 1.36 million tonnes, compared with 1.75 million tonnes in november. total stock for cpo and processed palm oil also fell by 11% to 2.01 million tonnes in december from 2.28 tonnes the month before. while the december to february period is known to be seasonally weak for palm oil production, the recent flooding in several states in peninsular malaysia has exacerbated supply concerns as vast tracts of oil palm land were inundated with water. on jan 1, plantations industries and commodity minister datuk amar douglas unggah embas said that up to 190,600ha of plantation land were affected, consisting of smallholdings as well as estates. as the extent of the flood damage is still unclear, the consequences of a delay in harvesting as well as mill shutdowns will only be seen in the coming months. the forecasted drop in supply bodes well for cpo prices as well as for producers who need to clear their stocks after a good harvest last year. however, the market has factored in recent developments, as evidenced by the rally in cpo. we believe that the impact of the floods to the industry will be short-lived as this occurrence will not severely impact fresh fruit bunch (ffb) yields, unlike in the event of hot and dry weather. as the water subsides, production is expected to normalise, says midf research analyst nadia kamil in a jan 13 report. malaysia is the worlds second largest producer of palm oil after indonesia, where production is expected to be flat this year after a bumper harvest in 2014. on the demand side however, prevailing headwinds have not abated. for example, demand by china, which has traditionally been malaysias biggest exports destination, has declined substantially on a year-on-year basis. for 2014, palm oil exports to china amounted to 2.84 million tonnes, a 23% drop from 3.7 million tonnes in 2013. india had picked up the slack in chinas import demand at the tail end of last year with 363,580 tonnes in december compared with chinas 257,380 tonnes. this was partly because indian farmers had held on to soy crops from crushing operations due to low soy prices, forcing refiners to increase palm oil imports to meet their edible oil production needs. furthermore, duty-free exports from malaysia contributed to the higher imports. to counteract this, on dec 26, indias government hiked its import duty on cpo imports to 7.5% from 2.5%, which could force refiners to seek locally sourced crops instead. rabobank internationals head of food and agribusiness research director pawan kumar believes that a multitude of unfavourable fundamental factors are working against the current cpo price recovery. first of all, there is still a global oversupply situation in edible oils, with the bumper soy harvest in the united states causing prices to stay low everywhere. now, with indias tax hike, malaysia might not see such big import numbers from the country going forward, says kumar. another mounting concern is the biofuels segment, which has become less economically feasible to produce due to the severe drop in crude oil prices. governments across the world had initiated mandates for renewable energy, including the use of palm oil blended with diesel in malaysia, a move that was intended to boost cpo consumption. cheap crude oils effect on biodiesel demand has been drastic. in december, biodiesel exports fell to just 614 tonnes, or a 97% month-on-month decline from 22,753 tonnes in november. between dec 1 and jan 1, brent crude fell from us$72 per barrel to us$56 per barrel, or a 22% decline. in a cheap crude situation, it will be hard to justify increasing the palm oil blend for biofuels on a pricing standpoint alone. global demand will slow down as consumers opt for less green fuel sources, adds rabobanks kumar, who does not foresee prices exceed rm2,300 due to weak underlying fundamentals on the demand side. while the existing mandates are backed by government subsidies and policies, discretionary demand has plummeted as biofuel production costs are typically passed through to consumers, making them much more expensive compared to diesel at present prices. discretionary demand could be largely lost at the current brent crude price of us$50 per barrel as it is no longer economically attractive, says maybank ib research analyst ong chee ting in a jan 13 note. as it stands, the upward direction of cpo prices could be capped as a clearer picture from the damage by the floods emerge, while demand factors remain weak and crude oil continues to fall.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on january 19 - 25 , 2015."}, "355": {"date_posted": "11/2/2015", "title": "malakoff walking a

heavily geared portfolio. reception to malakoffs initial public offering (ipo) will also set the stage for 1malaysia development bhds (1mdb) own listing of its energy unit, edra global energy bhd, which is expected to be delayed to the middle of the year. given the weak sentiment, malakoffs pricing and implied valuations will affect edra globals. interestingly, malayan banking bhd is playing a major role in both listings as joint manager, principal adviser, book runner and managing underwriter. however, there is some pressure for malakoff and edra global to be listed as soon as possible because both companies plan to utilise the bulk of the proceeds from their ipos to repay borrowings. another similarity between the two ipos is that they have both been considerably delayed or deferred. malakoffs listing was originally scheduled for between 2013 and 2014 but had to be put on hold when the groups flagship power station  the 2,100mw coal-fired plant in tanjung bin (t-bin3)  was repeatedly shut down due to leaks in the boiler tubes. the second delay came in the fourth quarter of last year, following a setback in the construction of tanjung bin 4 (t-bin4)  a 1,000mw coal-fired extension of the aforementioned plant that is due to be completed in march 2016. pricing and valuations problems at t-bin3 and t-bin4 may be the key risks for the ipo but at the end of the day, the success or failure of the offering comes down to its pricing. it will depend on how much malakoff wants to raise. in the current climate, i doubt they can be too aggressive with the pricing. initially, they were planning on raising us$1 billion. but in ringgit terms, that amount has grown from rm3 billion to over rm3.58 billion due to the exchange rate, says an analyst. note that malakoff plans to offer 1.522 billion shares in its ipo, consisting of one billion existing shares and 521.74 million new shares. this represents 30.4% of the enlarged issued and paid-up share capital. hence, working backwards, if malakoff raises rm3 billion, the ipo would be priced at about rm1.97 per share, resulting in a market capitalisation of rm9.9 billion. however, if malakoff plans to raise rm3.85 billion, that prices the ipo at rm2.35 per share and the market cap increases to rm11.8 billion. from a valuation perspective, that makes a huge difference. at rm1.97 per share, the company is valued at about 14 times estimated forward earnings of rm700 million for the financial year 2016. at rm2.35 per share, malakoff would be valued at just under 17 times forward earnings. the rm700 million profit after tax estimate is based on the assumption that t-bin3 stays fully operational and t-bin4 is completed on time and begins contributing to earnings. it also assumes growing contributions from the groups 50% acquisition of macarthur wind farm pty ltd for a$130 million (rm382 million) in mid-2013. note that the australia-based wind farm was loss-making prior to the acquisition. it broke even in 2013 and contributed to malakoffs earnings last year. more importantly, fund managers will be looking at the ipo from a dividend yield perspective. malakoffs management has indicated a minimum payout ratio of 70% of earnings, although that is non-binding. despite the companys poor performance in 2013 and 2014 due to the aforementioned operational issues, it maintained its dividend payout of about rm150 million (not including dividends for preference shares). at this level, the dividend yield would be between 1.5% and 1.3% based on an estimated share price of rm1.97 to rm2.35 respectively, which is much too low. based on analyst assumptions of rm700 million pat and a payout of 70%, the dividend per share should be 9.8 sen, resulting in a yield of between 4.9% and 4.1% for a share price of rm1.97 and rm2.35 respectively. if malakoff can price close to a 5% yield, it would be worth holding for a semi-yield play. but lower than that would be tough. there isnt room to grow locally with 1mdb getting most of the new projects. overseas, malakoffs ventures are not particularly impressive, the analyst points out. at the very least, there will be no room to grow in the near to medium term since projects as far ahead as 2021 have already been awarded, in this case to edra global. nonetheless, if malakoff prices itself with yields close to 5%, it could set too high a standard for edra global, which is only expected to price itself at a yield of between 2.5% and 3.5%, albeit with an earnings growth story. malakoff can list first. it shouldnt affect edra global significantly, which will be targeting mainly foreign institutions. malakoff is targeting mostly local institutions, explains a banker. in fact, it would be much worse for malakoff to list after edra global, which is planning to raise over rm9 billion. such a large issuance would soak up most of the liquidity in the market, making it a tough act to follow, notes the banker. keep in mind, however, that malakoff has strong incentives to raise as much cash as possible. the group plans to use 90% of the funds raised to fully redeem a rm1.8 billion junior sukuk musharakah facility before the profit rate jumps from 6.3% now to 9.3% from october. the sukuk was raised to finance mmc corps rm9.23 billion privatisation of malakoff back in 2007. however, with only 521.74 million new shares being issued, the proceeds will range from rm1.03 billion to rm1.23 billion  not enough to settle the sukuk. malakoff may need to maximise the value of the ipo to ensure it can settle the sukuk without relying too much on its rm2.4 billion cash balance. on the flipside, mmc corp stands to raise between rm1.97 billion and rm2.35 billion from the listing.  tanjung bin issues resolved? against this backdrop, malakoff still has the issue of t-bin3 and t-bin4. the t-bin3 outages in 2013 and 2014 are estimated to have cost the group over rm250 million in lost income, excluding repair costs. when contacted, malakoff could not respond to questions from the edge due to the blackout period while it finalises the ipo prospectus with the securities commission malaysia. the financial statements in the draft prospectus reveal that malakoffs revenue dipped 15.6% year on year to rm4.72 billion in the financial year ended dec 31, 2013, while net profit fell 57.16% to rm234.66 million. meanwhile, liquidated and ascertained damages on delays in the completion of t-bin4 could run as high as rm110 million, not including foregone income. however, malakoffs management addressed these risks in an analyst briefing early last week, say sources. blaming t-bin3s breakdown on the poor quality of the coal being supplied, management told analysts at the briefing that tenaga nasional bhd has agreed to supply higher-grade coal to prevent future mishaps. however, there is no contractual obligation to do so and tenaga will only supply the coal on a best-effort basis, say sources. nonetheless, the national utility firm is expected to deliver since a breakdown in t-bin3 would be equally, if not more, costly to it. as for t-bin4, the prospectus maintains the march 2016 commercial operation date, although earlier reports suggested that malakoff was seeking a six-month extension. according to the prospectus, t-bin4 is only 79% complete instead of 88% as scheduled. but management states that it is confident the plant will be ready on time, failing which malakoff should be indemnified by the engineering, procurement and construction contractors as well as the insurance it has on the project. moving forward, 2015 does not look like a great year for ipos, but it will certainly see some of the most interesting ones. malakoffs listing will be closely watched, thanks to 1mdb.  note: the edge

lumpur: former finance minister tun daim zainuddin (pic) said the country cannot ignore red flags that are affecting the economy globally that may have repercussions for the malaysian economy. we must stay omniscient of the reality that is hitting us, and the speed of which it is happening. who would have thought that in a short period of time, crude oil prices have dropped to levels of us$50 (rm178) per barrel [from about us$115 per barrel in june 2014], and our ringgit has depreciated to a level not seen since the asian financial crisis [in 1997 and 1998], he said in his keynote address at the affin hwang capital conference series 2015 yesterday. daim was addressing a roomful of investment bankers, analysts, fund managers as well as members of the press on the current economic situation in the country which he labelled as the elephant in the room, but reiterated prime minister datuk seri najib razaks stance that the country is not in a crisis. we are not in a crisis, but we cannot deny that we are in turbulent times. it will be foolish and nearsighted to deal with these turbulent times using unconvincing responses; we must think out of the box and resist conventional approaches, and make decisions that are strategic and have a long-lasting effect, said daim. the former finance minister stressed the importance of transparency in a time of turbulence. when i was the executive director of the national economic action council, as part of the national [economic] recovery plan, we knew the importance of enhancing domestic and international confidence through the release of timely, coordinated and accurate economic data which restored investor confidence and enhanced transparency, said daim. he also called on the government to be more transparent in the dealings of sovereign wealth fund 1malaysia development bhd (1mdb), which is wholly owned by the ministry of finance, and said the rakyat have the right to question the dealings of the fund. there are so many confusing statements on 1mdb and [the status of its finances]. if it is doing well, why isnt it paying its debts? why is so much money borrowed? the rakyat want to know [the answers to these questions], and i think there is no harm to being truthful. let us be honest, the more you try to hide, the more people become suspicious, daim said. he added that 1mdbs debt was one of the factors causing the weakening of the ringgit, stating that the sovereign funds debt had caused uncertainty in the domestic economy. it is difficult to say when exactly the ringgit will stabilise, as its [fluctuation] is tied to many things. 1mdb is one of the factors that causes uncertainty [in the economy] as its [debts] are big. its [estimated debt] is at [some] rm40 billion, daim told reporters after his keynote address. the ringgit was traded at 3.5805 against the us dollar at about noon yesterday. this compared with 3.1415 in august 2014. the edge financial daily (tefd), quoting sources, reported last friday that based on auditors feedback given to bank negara malaysia, the rm2 billion loan extended to 1mdb by several banks, was likely to be categorised as a non-performing loan (npl) by the lenders. malayan banking bhd (fundamental:1.50; valuation: 1.30) and rhb capital bhd (fundamental:1.50; valuation: 2.10) are the lead lenders with 58.99% and 32.41% respectively of the rm2 billion loan. the other lenders are alliance investment bank bhd (4.06%), malaysia building society bhd (fundamental: 1.20; valuation: 2.40) (3.24%) and hwangdbs investment bhd (1.29%), tefd reported. tefd also reported that the lenders were expected to revert on whether to officially declare the loan a default by feb 18. daim opined that 1mdbs loan should be categorised as a npl. i think it is time the loan be recognised as a npl, as they (1mdb) have been given extensions by the banks for the loan, and it is difficult to understand why they cannot settle the loan as they have already redeemed the funds [from the cayman islands], said daim. however, according to a recent news report by singapores business times, 1mdb executive director arul kanda kandasamy said 1mdb had no plans to repatriate the us$1.103 billion (rm3.95 billion) redeemed from its investments in the cayman islands. arul said the money would be used to service interest payments on 1mdbs us dollar-denominated debts. on the banking sectors role in turbulent times, daim said banks need to be financially strong and well-capitalised to weather the tough times. when i was the finance minister, i pushed for consolidation in the banking industry so as to avoid a financial crisis. our financial sector needs to be adequately capitalised and effectively supervised, he said. he added that the recent failed merger among cimb group holdings bhd (fundamental: 1.8; valuation: 1.8), rhb capital bhd and malaysia building society bhd should not hinder future consolidation efforts in the banking industry, as the country needs stronger banks to compete globally. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the

holds for airasia", "article": " with the black box now in hand, it will not be long before investigators piece together the events that led to the loss of indonesia airasias flight qz8501. it may bring closure to some, but the answers may put even more pressure on the regional aviation industry that is still recovering from the loss of two malaysian airline system bhd (mas) planes last year. depending on the findings, airasia bhd, which owns 49% of indonesia airasia, could be vindicated or suffer another blow to already weak sentiment. it doesnt seem to matter that indonesia airasia is 51%-controlled by indonesian investors. the wider airasia brand is expected to feel the pinch from the crash. the disaster will definitely have a negative impact on airasias brand. sure, the accident happened to an indonesian carrier (indonesia airasia), but it is a global brand. it is human nature to feel high anxiety post-crash, and people will look at alternatives in the short term, perhaps two to three months, says maybank investment bank analyst mohshin aziz. however, as long as airasia conducts itself well, it will bounce back, notes mohshin, who is still positive on the longer-term outlook of the group. as the wider market started to tumble towards the end of 2014, airasias share price bucked the trend, rising to as high as rm2.94, due mainly to the sharp fall in jet fuel prices. the lower oil prices do give airasia some breathing room. they are hedged at us$88 per barrel for half of their fuel needs for the whole of 2015. you can say they either get it half wrong or half right, mohshin says. note that fuel costs make up over 40% of the airlines operating costs. following the loss of flight qz8501, airasias share price fell 15.31% to as low as rm2.49 before rebounding to rm2.77 last friday. despite the incident, analysts are still relatively bullish on the stock, with an average target price of rm3.18 from 10 calls. there were five buy calls, two hold calls, one outperform call, one add call and one trading sell call. im still positive on airasia. at the current price, with the risk premium, it is a good time to buy if you take a longer-term view, says mohshin. still, there are some structural headwinds for airasia. other than its core malaysian business, other subsidiaries have been loss-making. while asia is the fastest-growing market for air travel, it is also expected to see the quickest expansion in capacity going forward, with the size of incoming capacity almost the same as the existing one. the lower oil prices have been a boon for the airline industry, but in an environment in which capacity is expanding rapidly, airlines like airasia may not see the same margin expansion as its peers in regions where consolidation has already taken place. in the near term, load factors and ticket prices will be lower. but we wont see the impact so soon. most passengers flying today made their bookings typically 1u00bd months in advance. load factors now are not a strong indicator of the impact. but we will see the impact down the line, says mohshin. perhaps the bigger concern moving forward is whether the disaster would slow down airasias aggressive expansion into new territories like japan and india. mohshin says regulators are going to scrutinise airasia much more closely now that it has lost its accident-free status. at least, the short-term impact on airasia is not expected to be as severe as what happened to mas with chinese travellers following the mh370 disaster. we have seen from past incidences that the indonesian travelling public is quite resilient compared with other countries, although foreign passengers travelling to indonesia may be less willing to fly indonesia airasia. compared with the chinese reaction to mh370, i expect less of a backlash from the indonesian travelling public, says leithen francis, managing director of singapore-based public relations firm francis and partners. it helps that airasias founder and group ceo tan sri tony fernandes has handled the entire situation very professionally. unlike mas, tony is the owner, and the boss of airasia for 14 years. he knows his way around in all aspects of the business and is able to answer questions instinctively with the utmost confidence, and is seen as genuine and trustworthy. of course, his personality also helps, mohshin says. the qz8501 incident has exposed some weaknesses in airasias business model, one that lies on having a non-controlling stake in another carrier but including it under the airasia brand. airasia has the same brand across all businesses. from a marketing perspective, that is a powerful multiplier effect. advertising and marketing in airasia malaysia can benefit airasia thailand and vice versa, for example. in the good times, this is great. but the downside is that an accident like this hurts the brand, although a different airline operator may be involved. consumers dont distinguish. as far as they are concerned, it is all airasia. hence, there is an adverse impact on all airasia-related brands, says francis. nonetheless, the benefits of using one brand outweigh the negative aspects, francis opines. even with different brands, consumers will see through it. for example, indonesia airasia pilots conduct their training in malaysia at airasias training facility. as the search and rescue efforts for flight qz8501 continue in the java sea, francis says it is pointless to speculate on the cause of the crash and relate it to previous indonesian air disasters. previous indonesian airline crashes involved aircraft landing. take-off and landing are the most dangerous parts of flying. a crash while the aircraft is cruising is very rare, francis says. meanwhile, airasia continues to be beset by finger pointing, even from indonesian ministry officials, who threatened to revoke indonesia airasias licence earlier last week. the reality is that these statements are unsubstantiated. until we see something in writing, everything is premature. even the insurers have been quiet about it. regulators, lawyers and insurers will make sure their facts are absolutely correct as they have the burden of proof. however, speculators dont, so they can say anything, mohshin says. was it human error, equipment failure or plain bad luck? the records in the black box shall reveal the answer soon.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on january 19 - 25 , 2015."}, "358": {"date_posted": "10/2/2015", "title": "what now after the failed mega merger?", "article": " the aborted merger of cimb group holdings bhd, rhb capital bhd and malaysia building society bhd (mbsb) has left many wondering  whats next for them? one of the topics that have emerged from the collapsed talks is the possibility of another suitor for rhb (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 2.1). it is no secret that the largest bank in the country, malayan banking bhd (maybank), also had its eye on rhb last year but was beaten to the punch by cimb (fundamental: 1.35; valuation: 2.1). back in 2011, both maybank and cimb had simultaneously pursued rhb. but they walked away after rhbs middle eastern shareholder abu dhabi commercial bank (adcb) sold its stake to a sister company at a hefty price, setting the valuation bar too high for a merger deal to happen. with negotiations for the tripartite merger called off now, speculation is rife that maybank may seize the opportunity to make a move on rhb. a senior maybanker acknowledges that in the banks scenario planning of potential acquisitions of local lenders, rhb has emerged as the top choice. however, he and other bankers point out that maybank is not likely to make a move immediately. when we looked at the scenarios u2026 rhb was the preferred choice. but you have to take into account why the mega merger with cimb was called off. the reasons for it being called off (see accompanying story) are valid concerns and the same concerns would be applicable to us, so we have to think hard about this, says the senior banker. another senior maybanker points out that the bank and rhb have too many overlapping businesses and functions. in a merger, there would have to be staff redundancies, things like vss (voluntary separation schemes), which employees are unlikely to want to take up in the current economic climate. so, it really makes more sense for maybank to seek opportunities to fill business gaps instead. if there was a good thai bank or indonesian insurance company, those would make more sense for maybank to acquire. industry observers also note that any acquirer of rhb would likely have to include mbsb (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 2.4) in the mix. this is because the employees provident fund (epf), the major shareholder of both rhb (41.5%) and mbsb (64.6%), is likely to want a bundled deal akin to the one that had been threshed out with cimb. still, it is no surprise that rhb has caught the interest of potential suitors. it has been one of the best performing local banks in terms of earnings recently. despite the tougher operating environment, rhb saw its net profit rise 16.5% to rm1.55 billion on the back of slightly higher revenue of rm7.58 billion in the nine months ended sept 30, 2014. annualised return on equity (roe) stood at 11.8%.  in contrast, cimbs nine-month net profit fell 17% to rm2.91 billion on the back of slightly lower revenue of rm10.47 billion, mainly because of its exposure to asset quality and profitability pressures in indonesia through bank cimb niaga. the indonesian operation used to account for about a third of cimbs profits. cimbs annualised net roe was 11.6%. meanwhile, there is speculation that japans sumitomo mitsui banking corp may also be keen on rhb. sumitomo ceased to be a substantial shareholder in rhb in march 2002 when it disposed of a 3.84% stake. in 2007, there was talk that the japanese lender had applied to bank negara malaysia for approval to start talks with the epf for a stake of up to 15% in rhb. but the acquisition never happened. instead, rhb saw the entry of adcb as its foreign shareholder. sumitomo, however, continues to have a good working relationship with rhb. it still maintains a japan desk in rhb, although it obtained its own banking licence in malaysia in 2011. there is market talk that the japanese bank could be keen to upgrade that working relationship to a shareholding partnership, says an industry observer. however, when asked about the possible emergence of a new suitor, a source close to the major shareholders of rhb says there is no conversation right now on any takeover. with the merger talks off, the group can get back to focusing on its business. merger talks can be distracting to all parties involved, he says. rhb group managing director kellee kam, in an internal memo to staff last week, said the group would now refocus its energy on accelerating its three-year transformation plan. the plan, known as ignite 2017, includes targets to boost revenue from overseas and accelerate islamic banking growth. is cimbs heyday over? industry observers say cimb must go back to the drawing board and come up with a concrete solution to improve its dismal earnings and cut costs. the countrys second largest banking group has seen year-on-year earnings drop for the last six quarters since the quarter ended june 30, 2013. costs went up substantially after it bought most of the royal bank of scotlands (rbs) investment banking businesses in asia-pacific in 2012, in a move to become a larger regional player, analysts say. perhaps the failed merger talks are a blessing in disguise. cimb still has to digest its rbs acquisition and its indonesian business is not doing well u2026 and given the current environment, it could be a bad idea for them to be undertaking an acquisition of that size, says a banking analyst. cimb acting group ceo tengku datuk zafrul aziz, in an internal memo to staff last week, said while the group was disappointed thatthe merger would not be realised, it would move on with its own plans as it had not pinned all its hopes on the merger. in fact, we have been working very hard behind the scenes on our new mid-term strategy and road map to 2018 since we announced the strategic review last year. now that the merger is no longer proceeding, we are ready to start implementing our strategic plans, he said, adding that the strategy would involve key focus areas such as culture, productivity, transaction banking, islamic banking and small and medium enterprises. zafrul took over the hot seat from datuk seri nazir razak last september. nazir moved on to become group chairman. mbsb works to become a bank non-bank lender mbsb is understood to be working on a five-year business plan. the tougher economic situation doesnt allow the group to explore mergers and acquisitions right now u2026 but perhaps in the next one or two years, or when things improve, it might look for another suitor, a source tells the edge. for now, it is continuing with its efforts to become a full-fledged bank. once it has moved more towards a banking platform, its options are better for getting a banking licence and doing m&a. its almost there on most counts when it comes to closing the gap to becoming a full-fledged islamic financial institution, the source adds.  note: the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical

surely people will think twice before accepting it. in a normal market environment, the take-up rate of a vss is about 60% to 70% u2026 but would that rate be the same in the current environment? the source adds. on top of these factors, there is also the falling stock price of cimb. the edge had on nov 3 written that if the divergence in share prices were to continue, it could lead to a recalibration of the relative values of the three entities. cimbs stock has shed 24.2% to rm5.29 last thursday since the structure of the mega merger was first announced on oct 9. rhbs has fallen 13.7% to rm7.51 over the same period, while mbsbs has risen 3.8% to rm2.46. last thursday, bloomberg reported, citing sources, that the terms of the merger between cimb and rhb could be renegotiated following the tumble in cimbs share price. industry observers say should the merger plans fall through, an alternative potential buyer could emerge for rhb. rhb did catch the eye of a few potential suitors, including maybank. so if the merger is off the table, it is possible that others may make a move on it, says an industry observer. according to another source, long-talked-about plans for a merger between rhb and mbsb may be re-explored. the parties may rope in a smaller islamic outfit into the mix, the person says. as it stands, the proposed cimb-rhb-mbsb mergerhas been structured such that rhb will acquire cimbs assets and liabilities via a share swap at an exchange ratio of 1.38 (one rhb share for every 1.38 cimb share). this is based on a benchmark price of rm7.27 per cimb share and rm10.03 per rhb share, translating into a price-to-book value (p/bv) ratio of 1.7 times and 1.44 times for cimb and rhb respectively. their islamic operations, which will then come under cimb islamic bank, will then acquirembsb to form a mega islamic bank, at a price of rm7.77 billion or rm2.82 per share. this translates into a p/bv of 1.32 times and mbsb shareholdershave a choice to either accept cash or new shares in the unlisted cimb islamic group.  this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on january 12 - 18 , 2015."}, "360": {"date_posted": "4/2/2015", "title": "klci up 23.5pts, ringgit firmer ", "article": " kuala lumpur (february 4): the fbm klci tapered gains for a 23.50 points or 1.32% rise following overnight us markets gains and crude oil price rebound. at 12.30pm, the klci settled at 1,804.76 points. the index earlier reached a high of 1,831.41 before investors took profit. in a note today, maybank investment bank bhd advocated profit-taking on rallies for the week, based on the current market conditions. with the plunge from the 1,896.23 high to the low of 1,671.82, we advise clients to trade within the stipulated support and resistance zones. take short-term profits at the resistance areas of 1,781 to 1,896. the support levels of 1,718 and 1,770 will witness minor nibbling activities, said maybank. the bourse saw 1.36 billion shares worth 1.39 billion traded, with 434 gainers against 335 decliners. top gainers included british american tobacco (m) bhd, nestle (m) bhd and petronas dagangan bhd. meanwhile hong leong capital bhd led decliners. the most-active stock was nexgram holdings bhd. the market also kept a close watch on the ringgit which, at 12.40pm, firmed up to 3.5545 against the us dollar compared to the singapore dollar, the ringgit was traded at 2.6436.\n\nthe ringgit's strength was seen due to higher prices of crude oil, which constitutes a crucial portion of the malaysian economy. asian shares advanced. japans nikkei 225 rose 2.2%, south koreas kospi gained 0.8% while hong kongs hang seng increased 0.9%. reuters reported that asian share markets followed wall street higher on wednesday as revived risk sentiment dented the u.s. dollar and sovereign bonds, though it was far from clear how long the sudden mood swing would last. much might depend on whether oil can sustain its recent rally, thus helping to underpin energy stocks and lessen fears of global deflation. reuters reported oil prices fell on wednesday as renewed concerns over global demand and high stock levels halted a rally that pushed up prices by about 19 percent over the past four sessions.

valuation: 1.8) stands to lose the most as 60% of its traffic is domestic. meanwhile its long-haul arm, airasia x (aax) (fundamental: 0; valuation: 0.3) would be least affected as all its flights are on international routes. malaysian airline system bhd (mas) (fundamental: 0.2; valuation: 0) will be right in the middle as domestic passengers constitute only 37% of its total passengers. rhb research analyst ahmad maghfur usman also expects consumer sentiment to be weak due to the gst and pointed out that airlines such as airasia and mas could have their yields upsides capped as a result. we expect that passenger growth may not reach double-digit levels due to the uncertain sentiment from the gst. industry players, however, are more optimistic about the eventual implementation of gst. the impact on demand for air transportation in malaysia will not be affected by gst because it is still an essential service for the majority of consumers as it saves travelling time over long distances, said malaysian association of tour and travel agents executive committee member datuk tan kok liang. one saving grace that should also not be discounted is the downward trend of jet fuel price since mid-2014 due to ample global supply, which will provide the necessary cushion against any potential fall in domestic air travel demand in malaysia. this was pointed out by airasia group chief executive officer tan sri tony fernandes, who told the edge financial daily that lower fuel cost will help keep its fares competitive. a us$1 (rm3.62) per barrel change in oil price would have an inverse impact on its bottom line by rm13.5 million in financial year 2015 (fy15) and fy16. meanwhile, airasias sensitivity to the same change would inversely impact earnings by 2.3% in fy15, which is approximately rm18.4 million to rm19.2 million. the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on historical numbers. the valuation score determines if a stock is attractively valued or not, also based on historical numbers. a score of 3 suggests strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. go to www.theedgemarkets.com for more details on a companys financial dashboard.   this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on february 4, 2015."}, "362": {"date_posted": "4/2/2015", "title": "government-linked funds scoop up local equities", "article": " kuala lumpur: while foreign institutions were selling, government-linked funds such as the employees provident fund (epf) and permodalan nasional bhd (pnb) have been scooping up local equities, capitalising on the weak market sentiment caused by fresh concern about the countrys economy amid falling crude oil prices and the weaker ringgit. when contacted, areca capital sdn bhd chief executive officer danny wong, said fallen local equity prices have presented a buying opportunity for government-linked funds. he noted that only during such weak market sentiment that large institutional funds could acquire a sizeable number of shares without triggering a rally in stock prices. taking a pension fund as an example, when the market is on an uptrend, its hard to collect sizeable shares, without further boosting its prices, he said. according to data compiled by the edge financial daily, the epf had, from jan 1 to jan 27, 2015, recorded substantial net purchases of shares in beaten down oil and gas companies, namely sapurakencana petroleum bhd (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.8), bumi armada bhd (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 0.6) and dialog group bhd (fundamental: 0.7; valuation: 1.7). (see table) it also recorded substantial net purchases of shares in banking groups cimb group holdings bhd (fundamental: 2.1; valuation: 1.35) and bimb holdings bhd (fundamental: 2.7; valuation: 1.8). also in the same period, pnb recorded substantial net purchases of shares in government-linked companies (glcs) such as sime darby bhd (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.3), umw holdings bhd (fundamental: 1.2; valuation: 2.2), telekom malaysia bhd (fundamental: 0.9; valuation: 1.1) and tenaga nasional bhd [tnb] (fundamental: 1.3; valuation: 1.8). fund managers said these purchases reflected the funds confidence in the long-term prospects of the said major corporations, despite the temporary blip in some of their business operations. for instance, sapurakencana, which also recorded net purchases of shares by pnb in january, besides epf, saw its share price decline sharply since last october, tumbling from about rm4.10 to a low of rm2.10 in december, in line with the sharp drop in global oil prices. nevertheless, with recent purchases by local institutions such as the epf and pnb, the stock has rebounded to about rm2.80 recently. from jan 1 to 27, epf and pnb had recorded net purchases of some 37.46 million shares and seven million shares respectively in sapurakencana. meanwhile, among the top net purchases by epf was cimb, in which the retirement fund recorded a net purchase of 25.05 million shares during the jan 1 to 27 period. cimbs share price recovered somewhat after news came out on jan 14 on the cancellation of the tripartite merger involving the group, rhb capital bhd (fundamental: 1.5; valuation: 2.1) and malaysia building society bhd (fundamental: 2.4; valuation: 1.2). the banking group had seen a sharp drop in its share price since it unveiled the merger structure on oct 9 last year, due to market concerns over the viability of the exercise. hence, following the cancellation of the deal, interests in the stock had been revived to a certain extent. the epf is the second largest shareholder of cimb with total holding of 1.27 billion shares or a 15.13% equity interest. pnb, on the other hand, had also taken the opportunity to increase its stakes in glcs such as telekom by 1.25%, and in tnb by 0.56% during the jan 1 to 27 period. through its trust fund amanahraya trustees bhd-skim amanah saham bumiputera, pnb is the third largest shareholder of both corporations, with some 12.64% stake in telekom and an 8.43% stake in tnb. pnb capitalised on the drop in share prices of both entities at the beginning of the month to increase its shareholdings. for instance, it purchased a block of 15.63 million shares representing a 0.42% stake in telekom on jan 5 when the stock was trading at levels of rm6.81. telekom shares closed at rm6.99 last friday. similarly, tnb shares which closed at rm14.50 last friday, were trading at levels of rm13.74 to rm13.80 at the beginning of the month (jan 2 to 7), with pnb snapping up 18.07 million shares during the period, representing a 0.32% stake in the utility giant. unlike foreign funds, the weaker ringgit is not a cause for concern for local funds when investing in local equities, said wong. (the ringgit was traded at rm3.64 against the us dollar as at time of writing). when foreign funds exit local equities partly due to concerns of the ringgit, local long-term funds may take advantage to accumulate. [and when the] foreign funds do return to local equities, it will be the local institutions turn to take profit; its quite a normal cycle for emerging markets, he said. according to a report by maybank ib research on jan 29, bursa malaysias fund flow data showed that foreign investors had net sold rm2.4 billion worth of malaysian equities since early this year until jan 22, adding on to a net sale of rm6.9 billion in 2014. rhb research institute head of research alexander chia said that government-linked funds with long-term investment horizons typically tend to choose stocks that possess sound fundamentals, decent market liquidity, high corporate governance standards, good growth prospects and attractive yields. over the years, the growing size of these funds and their need to buy on market weakness have earned the malaysian market a reputation for being defensive and low beta, as these funds are perceived to be supporting the market. however, this perception is somewhat unfair as it is very much a function of the size of their funds, said chia.   the edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength, calculated based on

is expected to announce its 4qfy14 results sometime at the end of february 2015. for its 3qfy14 results announcement, the group saw its nine-month (9mfy14) accumulated profit improve. petra energys revenue rose 25% to rm417 million in 9mfy14 from rm333.4 million in 9mfy13, while profit before tax expanded correspondingly by 15.8% to rm19.8 million in 9mfy14 from rm17.1 million in 9mfy13. according to petra energys announcement, the strong improvement in profitability was attributed to positive contribution from the integrated brownfield maintenance and engineering services segment. overall, petra energy may have improved its profitability in fy14 but investors seem to have taken a more macro approach and discounted the improved profitability as falling crude oil prices and the weak outlook for the oil and gas industry continue to cast a bearish outlook for the sector. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that three research houses cover petra energy, with a hold call, a buy and a sell call. this stock currently trades at a price-earnings ratio of 15.8 times while its price-to-book value ratio of 0.84 times indicates that its share price is trading at a slight discount to its book value. petra energys chart trend, on daily, weekly and monthly time frames, is very firmly down. its share price has made a large decline since its major daily wave-5 and recent high of rm3.16 in june 2014. since that rm3.16 high, petra energy fell to its january 2015 recent low of rm1.32. as prices broke below their recent key critical support levels of rm2.38 and rm1.98, look to sell petra energy on any rebounds to its resistance areas as the mas depict very firm short- to long-term downtrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and stochastic) have issued sell signals and now depict very firm indications of petra energys eventual move towards much lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm1.33, rm1.98 and rm2.38. we expect petra energy to witness weak buying interest at its support levels of rm1.19, rm1.25 and rm1.30. its downside targets are at rm1.31, rm0.80

their already tight margins this year as the upcoming goods and services tax (gst) and weaker ringgit are likely to add to cost pressure, said analysts. this is because it is unlikely that automotive players could raise prices and pass on additional costs to car buyers, with the heightened competition in the market and the tightening of loan criteria by banks. as it is, automotive players have already been forced to throw out promotions and discounts in what is seen to be a prelude to a possible price war.  ta securities research analyst angeline chin told the edge financial daily that automotive players, especially in the most affordable a segment (mini cars) and b segment (sub-compact cars), would risk further margin erosion to keep their market share. competition is already heating up. to vigorously defend market share, we expect more discounts and promotions to be given to lure buyers, she said in an email. midf research analyst annuar rahman told the edge financial daily that competition could pick up this year, especially post-gst. while most car manufacturers indicated that there would be some downward adjustment in prices, the softer demand as a result of the gst imposition could see competition increasing, he said. players such as umw holdings bhd (fundamental: 2.2; valuation: 1.2) and tan chong motor holdings bhd (fundamental: 0.8; valuation: 1.8) could also see their margins coming under pressure as a result of the higher us dollar apart from competition, he said. umw carries the toyota brand, while tan chong is the distributor of nissan vehicles. chin agreed that umw would be hit by the stronger greenback as the bulk of its purchases are in us dollar. the weakening ringgit is worrying and it may drive up the price of imported spare parts, she wrote in her report dated jan 22. meanwhile, annuar said he would not rule out a further tightening of lending requirements by bank negara malaysia to contain the level of household indebtedness. given the industry headwinds, most analysts have kept a neutral rating for the automotive sector this year, citing a lack of exciting near-term catalysts. the effects of these headwinds were already felt as early as the last quarter of 2014, when automotive players reported lower operating profit in their latest quarterly financial results compared with the same quarter in the previous year. we maintain our neutral stance on the sector as we believe that the sector is fairly valued and has limited rerating catalysts, said affin hwang investment bank bhd research analyst ong boon leong in a report dated jan 22. ongs sentiment was also shared by annuar in his sector update report, saying we believe earnings risks are largely priced in. despite the challenging operating environment, analysts still see some worthy pickings, like mbm resource bhd (fundamental: 1.4; valuation: 1.2) and berjaya auto bhd (fundamental: 2.35; valuation: 0.9) that may perform reasonably well, if not better than expectations. midfs annuar sees potential positive in the turnaround of mbm resourcess alloy-rim business, oriental metal industries (m) sdn bhd, which should see higher utilisation rate. he also noted that mbm resources may see stronger contributions from its associate companies, perusahaan otomobil kedua sdn bhd (perodua) and hino motors manufacturing (m) sdn bhd, despite weaker earnings recorded last year due to start-up costs from new manufacturing facilities. perodua is expected to see strong sales from the new perodua axia and the recently-launched perodua myvi facelift, said annuar, who recommended a buy on mbm resources with a target price of rm4.80. mbm resources is also maybank investment bank research analyst ivan yaps top pick, given its more attractive valuations and exposure to the small-car segment via perodua. hence, yap too has a buy call on the stock, but with a lower tp of rm3.50. meanwhile, berjaya auto, which markets the mazda brand, is cimb investment bank research analyst azman hussins top pick for the sector. the firm, which he has an add call on, is expected to launch a slew of new models that will help sustain its strong growth trajectory this year, he said. kenanga research analyst desmond chong also thinks berjaya auto is the apparent winner in the automotive sector, due to the weakening yen against the ringgit as approximately 50% of its total costs is exposed to the yen. hence, chong has an outperform call on the stock with a tp of rm4.29. we expect the yen to stay soft, he said in a recent report, adding that every 1% fluctuation in the yen would raise the groups net profit by 5% in fy15 and fy16. \nthe edge researchs fundamental score reflects a companys profitability and balance sheet strength,

crude oil rebounded slightly to us$46.58 (rm167.68) per barrel. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since may 2013 have key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low),

all the indexs daily signals turned positive recently. as such, the indexs clear support levels are seen at 1,671, 1,745 and 1,781 while the resistance areas of 1,788, 1,805 and 1,858 may cap any index rebound. the klcis 18 and 40 simple moving averages (sma) depict an emerging uptrend for its daily chart. however, the price bars of the index are now between the 50 and 200 sma and remain in a neutral position on that front. with the recent price movement above the key 1,770 resistance, this has negated the klcis downside target of 1,630 for now. due to the improving tone for the klci, we are recommending a chart buy on sunzen biotech bhd (sunzen). sunzen released its third quarter of 2014 (3q14) results at the end of november 2014, and will announce its 4q14 results in february. in its 3q14 result announcement, revenue declined 5.8% year-on-year while profit-before-tax tumbled 93%. according to sunzens announcement, the poor profitability was due to provision for impairment of inventories and provision for write-off on receivables as well as the increase in marketing and distribution expenses. overall, the fundamentals for sunzen appeared to be unfavourable but this may have been factored into the share price which fell marginally in december 2014. despite the previous quarterly results, investors continued to show a keen interest in the stock. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that no research houses cover sunzen. this stock currently trades at a high price-earnings ratio of 50.9 times while its price-to-book value ratio of 2.71 times indicates that its share price is trading at a steep premium to its book value. sunzens chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly timeframes is very firmly up. its share price has made a large surge since its major weekly wave-2 low of rm0.12 in may 2012. since that rm0.12 low, sunzen has surged to its january 2015 recent all-time high of rm0.60. as prices broke below their recent key critical resistance levels of rm0.39 and rm0.47, look to buy sunzen on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to medium-term uptrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) have issued buy signals and now depict very firm indications of sunzens eventual move towards much higher levels. it would attract firm buying activities at the support levels of rm0.39, rm0.47 and rm0.59. we expect sunzen to witness some profit-taking at its resistance level and all-time high of rm0.60. its upside targets are rm0.65,

confirming the edge financial dailys reporton tuesday. cimb, in a letter, informed the other two banking groups yesterday that it had decided to abort the merger in light of the current economic conditions. we had thoroughly deliberated the merger, and while we remain convinced that the combination of our three franchises follows sound strategic logic, we ultimately were not able to arrive at a value-creating transaction for all stakeholders. the decision to cease discussions was arrived at after a detailed review of potential synergies that could be realistically delivered, especially in the current economic environment, cimbs acting group chief executive, tengku datuk zafrul aziz, said in a joint statement yesterday. accordingly, the three parties have ceased discussions. thiscomes six months after the proposed merger, which would have created the countrys largest banking group and a mega islamic bank, was first announced in july 2014. cimb and rhbcap said they had withdrawn a joint application to bank negara malaysia to seek approval for the merger. the three parties have also terminated the exclusivity agreement that they had entered into. this means, other parties that are speculated to be keen on exploring a merger with rhbcap, such as malayan banking bhd, can now approachthe former if they want to. cimb, in an internal memo to its staff on the aborted deal yesterday, said following the detailed discussions over the last few months and the shift in the economic outlook, the group had concluded that its ability to realise targeted merger synergies would be impacted. as such, it said there was no longer a compelling case for the merger to proceed. when the merger was first proposed last year, we had made certain assumptions based on the economic conditions and outlook that were reflective of the environment at that point in time. however, many of these assumptions needed to be revisited, with the major changes in economic environment, such as the significant change in oil prices and currency exchange rates, as well as the challenging outlook for the financial services industry, tengku zafrul said in the memo that was viewed by the edge financial daily. he went on to say that while he was disappointedthat the merger would not be realised cimb would move on with its own plans as it had not pinned all its hopes on the merger. in fact, we have been working very hard behind the scenes on our new mid-term strategy and roadmap to 2018, since we announced the strategic review last year. now that the merger is no longer proceeding, we are ready to start implementing our strategic plans, he said, adding that its strategy would involve key focus areas such as culture, productivity, transaction banking, islamic banking and small and medium enterprises. rhbcap group managing director kellee kam in a separate internal memo to staff said while the prospect of creating the countrys largest banking group was exciting, the changing economic environment and market conditions had created significant challenges for the group to be able to realise synergies. the group would not have been able to deliver a value-enhancing proposal to stakeholders, he said. part of the decision to terminate the discussions was also premised on the strong standalone proposition the rhb group brings to the table, he said. he said the group would now refocus its energy on accelerating its five-year transformation plan, known as ignite 2017. as for mbsb, it is understood that the non-bank lender will now continue with its efforts to become a bank. its president and ceo datuk ahmad zaini othman said the opportunity to be a part of a mega islamic bank had been an exciting one. given that the discussions have ceased, we can now continue to focus on the strength of our franchise and achieving the goals that we have originally set for ourselves, he said in a statement. the edge financial daily on tuesdayreported that an announcement on the mega merger being called off was expected before the end of the week. the edge weekly had in its jan 10 issue also reported that therewas a strong possibility the merger could be called offdue to several factors, including that the economic landscape had become more challenging compared to six months ago, making it a bad time to go into a merger of this size. another factor was that rhbcap was seeking a revision of the terms, having seen how substantially cimbs share price had fallen since the structure of the merger was first announced onoct 9last year. the report cited sources as saying that instead of an all-share deal in its merger with cimb, it now wanted a cash portion to be included, making a deal potentially more expensive for cimb. when met by reporters at an event early yesterday, cimb chairman datuk seri nazir razak said there was no change to the terms of the proposed deal. he saidthe due diligence exercise conducted for the proposed merger had been completed, and that the three parties were validating the business case of the merger. cimb shares closed down 17 sen at rm5.75 yesterday. rhbcap shares eased 15 sen to rm7.65, while mbsbs share price gained 10 sen to end

to close at rm5 on dec 22, outperforming the fbm klcis x% decline. several short-term catalysts may drive the stock over the next five months, including an increase in revenue contribution from property sales as well as the klang valley mass rapid transit (kvmrt) line 1 construction project, which should improve investor sentiment in the stock after a year of market-beating gains. gamuda-wd, which expires on may 25, carries a strike price of rm2.66 and has a one-to-one conversion ratio. the warrant has gained about 10% this year to close at rm2.28 on dec 22, a modest 0.4% premium to the mother share. note that gamuda-wd continues to trade at near-zero premiums to its mother share, which indicates an active buying interest in the warrant. maybank investment bank researchs (maybank ib

income from various concessions, which would mitigate the risks of a potential downturn in the economy. gamuda is our top pick for the construction sector as it is a major beneficiary of major infrastructure projects. the rm5 billion penang transport project is also a major catalyst for the group, which is a candidate for the project delivery partner (pdp) role. cimb research analyst

syarikat pengeluar air sungai selangor sdn bhd (splash) to the selangor government. gamudas stock is down about 9% from its 52-week high of rm5.31 and in our view, its current share price offers a

the edge financial daily reported that 1mdb had failed to repay the rm2 billion loan to local lenders due on dec 31, 2014. it quoted sources saying 1mdb was given until jan 30, 2015 to settle the debt that was originally due on nov 30, 2014. maybank and rhb capital bhd are the lead lenders of the loan. assuming the worst-case scenario, cimb ibs ng said a full impairment of maybanks loans to 1mdb would slash 56% of his estimated net profit for maybank in fy15 and cut the target price by about 44 sen to rm12.06. but he believes an impairment of the loan is unlikely to occur as it is guaranteed by the government of abu dhabi. furthermore, the loans would be settled if the sovereign wealth fund successfully lists its energy unit edra global energy bhd this year. hence, we do not see a high likelihood of full impairment of the loans, said ng. the maybank management declined to comment on its loan exposure to 1mdb, citing the banking secrecy act. a market observer said maybanks earnings will not be impacted at all as any impairment of the loan, if defaulted, is not likely to occur. the loan was due in november, but it was never impaired. then, it got extended to december, which was also never impaired. it (the repayment) will forever be due and forever never be impaired, she told the edge financial daily over the telephone. so, if it is never impaired, how will it impact the [maybank] financials? she said rhetorically. the market observer, however, warned that maybank could suffer in terms of investor sentiment on its stock, citing that there would be an overhang until the issue surrounding the 1mdb loan is resolved. meanwhile, pkr lawmaker wong chen told the edge financial daily that 1mdbs failure to repay its rm2 billion loans to rhbcap and maybank on time was very worrying. we wish to remind the government that the rakyat via the employees provident fund (epf), own substantial stakes in both rhbcap (41%) and maybank (14%). as such, 1mdb should not be given special national interest treatment and all dealings by the banks must be transparent and above board, he said. according to wong, legal proceedings should immediately proceed should 1mdb miss the new jan 30, 2015 deadline. considering the size of the loans, he urged maybank and rhbcap to publicly commit to this tough position to safeguard the reputation of the banking sector. we are also very worried about the damage this episode has on the expected march 2015 ipo (initial public offering) of 1mdb energy (now known as edra global energy). it sends a very negative perception of the viability of the ipo when the parent company cant get its financial act together, wong said, adding that 1mdb should immediately return the cayman island money and use that to pay off the rm2 billion debt. sources told the edge financial daily that the inability of 1mdb to meet its debt obligation on time showed how it is struggling with its cash flow. sources also said the matter was brought to the attention of bank negara malaysia, whereby 1mdb chairman tan sri lodin wok kamaruddin, director tan sri ismee ismail and former chief executive officer (ceo) mohd hazem abdul rahman were given a dressing-down by the central bank. the 1mdb executives were told in very strong terms that they will face action if the matter is not settled. meanwhile, newly-appointed ceo of 1mdb, arul kanda

borrower. it remains to be seen how fast this could translate into actions.  this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on january 8, 2015."}, "380": {"date_posted": "23/12/2014",

what many are seeing as less-than-friendly weather ahead. in fact, 2015 has been described as no less than gloomy, thanks to slower global growth and lower domestic consumption, which is expected to continue to squeeze net interest margins (nims) and stifle loan growth. m&a securities sdn bhd head of research rosnani rasul (pic) did not mince words when she told the edge financial daily recently that things could get worse next year for banks and the industry will simply have to ride out the storm. there will be times whenbankswill prosper and there will be times when they will have to expect smaller growth. i expect that it is the latter next year.there are macroeconomic issues which will affectbanks financial performance next year and they are out ofbankscontrol, said rosnani. cimb research analyst winson ng too expectsbanks underwhelming earnings seen throughout 2014 to continue into the new year, and holds a negative rating on thebankingsector. so far, there appears to be a disconnect between the countrys growth and the banks earnings. the gross domestic product growth seen in the first half of 2014 has not been reflected in thebanks financial results in the last few quarters. this is an industry-specific problem, ng observed. ng forecasts thatbankswill see more moderate loan growth in 2015 from households and businesses due to the effects of the goods and services tax (gst) in april, and higher inflation. he said households will be more cautious in their spending as disposable income shrinks in the light of rising cost of living, and this will suppress household loan growth, which is currently supported by mortgages. but that support wont last for long as the full effects of the governments cooling measures on the property market onbankswill become more evident in 2015. to date, the slowdown in the property market has not translated into weaker growth in mortgages. this is becausebanksare still benefiting from development projects, which have been in the pipeline in the last three years. going forward, softer property transactions will have a stronger impact onbanks loan growth, reasoned ng. uob kay hian head of research vincent khoo, who has a market weight rating on the bankingsector, expects loan growth in 2015 to decline from 7.8% to 8% in 2014 to 7% on the back of moderating household loans, as well as a weak and patchy corporate loan growth recovery. there is also continuous pressure on nims due to more intense competition for loans and deposits. rising funding cost on the back of intense competition for deposits will continue to be one of the biggest challenges forbanksin 2015. this is especially so with the implementation of a net stable funding ratio under basel iii and the 10-year record high system loan to deposit ratio, said khoo. bankswith relatively lower current and savings account ratio and higher loan to deposit ratio are likely to face greater headwinds, both from margin and loan growth perspectives, he said. midf research analyst kelvin ong has a neutral call on the sector but noted that demand for business loans will be impacted by slower export growth due to slower growth in the global economy. as exports grow at a slower pace, we anticipate capital expenditure spending by companies to slow down. this will impact business loan demand. against this backdrop, we expect the sectors loan to grow at a slower pace of 8% to 9% for 2015, as opposed to 9% to 10% for 2014, he said. amresearch also maintained a neutral rating on the sector for next year, citing nim compression as well as credit costs to be major issues of uncertainty for 2015. in a research note dated dec 4, amresearch analyst rachel huang said she had downgraded thebankingsectors net earnings growth assumption to 0.6% for 2015 from 12.6%. in terms of revenue assumptions, sector loan growth assumption has been lowered to 8% from 8.5% previously for next year. like khoo, she expects credit costs to pose a challenge tobanks. she said credit costs may remain relatively high due to sporadic weakness in the corporate segment as well as retrenchment exercises for workers employed in the airline and media segments. still, despite the gloomy forecasts, there are some good pickings to be found. one consensus top stock is malayan banking bhd. despite recent earnings headwinds, we believe that on the balance, valuations remain relatively compelling for a liquid, large-capbankat 1.6 times fy15 price-to-book value and with return on equity (roe) slightly above the industrys average roe of 13% and further underpinned by dividend yields in excess of 6%, said uob kay hians khoo.  this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on december 23, 2014."}, "381": {"date_posted": "19/12/2014",

malaysias top two banking groups  cimb group holdings bhd and malayan banking bhd (maybank)  which have operations in aseans biggest economy. last month, both their indonesian banking subsidiaries turned in weaker-than-expected numbers for the third quarter ended sept 30, largely because of higher loan loss provisions. analysts are saying their fourth-quarter performance could be just as bad, if not worse, with the heavy provisioning expected to continue. cimb groups 96.9%-owned pt bank cimb niaga tbk, the fifth largest lender in the republic by assets, reported a third quarter net profit of idr343 billion  a sharp 68.2% decline from the same quarter a year ago and a 59.9% drop from the previous quarter. as for maybanks 78.9%-owned pt bank internasional indonesia tbk (bii), the ninth largest lender, its third-quarter net profit at idr3.7 billion was a dramatic 99.1% plunge from that in the same quarter a year ago and a 97.5% drop from that in the previous quarter. but they are not alone in turning in dismal performances. except for indonesias big four state-owned banks, namely pt bank mandiri tbk, pt bank rakyat indonesia tbk, pt bank negara indonesia tbk and pt bank tabungan negara tbk, other mid and small-sized lenders also saw their third-quarter earnings take a hit for similar reasons  higher provisions and lower margins. will things improve from next year or are both cimb group and maybank headed for a long and bumpy ride in indonesia? investors are understandably nervous at these developments as both cimb group and maybank have, in recent years, derived a substantial portion of their earnings from indonesia. whats clear, however, is that the tougher challenges in that country will have a greater impact on cimb group than maybank as the former tends to derive about 30% of its bottom line from indonesia. for maybank, its only about 7%. to make things worse, both banking groups have been seeing sharply lower investment banking income amid weaker capital markets in the region. and in the case of cimb group, it is in the midst of a proposed merger with smaller malaysian rivals rhb capital bhd and malaysia building society bhd (mbsb), which throws up other complexities and uncertainties for investors. what went wrong indonesian banks have enjoyed strong profits in the last few years as the gap between the interest they charge on loans and what they pay out to depositors is relatively wide. despite increasingly coming under pressure, net interest margins (nim) in indonesia are still the highest among asean countries  averaging around 4% to 5% now compared with 5.9% in 2009. this, and the sectors high growth potential in the populous nation, were reasons banks around the region, including cimb group and maybank, flocked to indonesia in recent years. but a combination of factors that have come into play since last year  slower economic growth, high inflation, a rising interest rate environment, a weaker rupiah and lower commodity prices  have weighed on the sector. things took a turn for the worse this year. in the run-up to the presidential election (in july), a lot of corporates were not willing to spend amid all the uncertainties ... so investments were put on hold and loan growth tapered off. also, the export-oriented companies were hit by a decline in commodity prices, says a senior banking analyst who tracks the sector. then, there were fuel price increases last week (of more than 30%), following june 2013s 44% increase under the governments fuel subsidy rationalisation programme, which hurt consumer sentiment and also led to an increase in the benchmark interest rate. additionally, the larger state-owned banks started a price war on the deposit rate side, so competition for deposits got stiffer and funding costs rose. all these factors ruined the banking party in indoneisa. joko widodo, sworn in as indonesias new president on oct 20, raised fuel prices last week in his first major economic policy decision since taking on the role, to help fund his reform agenda. last year alone, indonesias central bank raised the benchmark interest rate by 175 basis points to contain inflation. the idr2,000 per litre fuel hike last tuesday also prompted the central bank to lift the rate for the first time this year, by another 25 basis points, to 7.75%. outlook a combination of these factors could push banks non-performing loans (npls) even higher next year, putting further pressure on profits. economists expect the inflation rate in indonesia to rise to 7.5% at the end of the year, from 4.83% in october, as a result of the fuel price adjustment, before peaking at around 8.5% in the middle of next year. more interest rate hikes are expected next year. usually, after two or three quarters after inflation peaks, npls should start to come off, says rahmi marina, an indonesia-based banking analyst at maybank kim eng research. she has a neutral call on the sector. as it stands, the outlook for the sectors 119 commercial banks remains murky. the industrys gross npl ratio  which measures banks npls against total loans  deteriorated to 2.31% in august from 1.8% as at end-2013, according to latest data from the financial services authority. although still relatively low and well below the 5% threshold that is considered safe  it was around 4% in august 2008 and even higher at 8% in december 2005  the level is expected to continue to trend upwards by year-end. we expect npl levels to remain elevated going into 2015, maybank chief financial officer rafique merican tells the edge. in mid-september, bank indonesia deputy governor halim alamsyah revealed that the central bank had been monitoring the high level of npls in four sectors  construction (4.43% as at july), trade (3.06%), mining (3.09%) and social services (2.96%)  and would study whether this was a temporary phenomenon. indonesian banking analyst rocky indrawan of rhb research says the country is undergoing its third npl upcycle since the 1997/98 asian financial crisis, the last ones having been in 2006 and 2009, driven by a combination of a slowdown in the economy, elevated inflation and higher interest rates following increases in the price of fuel. the system is currently digesting similar adjustments. although we cannot compare the upcycles of 2006 and 2009 with the current one, we note that asset quality only improved after 20 and 10 consecutive months respectively of elevated npl ratios. the possibility of further fuel price and interest rate hikes suggests that there may be sustained stress on npls. (but) npl ratios should stay below historical peaks due to tightening and prudential measures along with banks reduced risk appetite, he says in a sept 10 report on the banking sector. as it is, the industry is seeing slower loan growth. expectations are that lending will slow to 15% this year from 22% last year. and intense competition for deposits has driven up funding costs, particularly for the small to mid-sized lenders, squeezing margins. on the positive side, however, the central bank imposed a cap on deposit rates last month, so there could be some improvement in the banks funding costs. this could be the only bright spot for these banks. asset quality, however, could remain an issue for a while, alliancedbs researchs banking analyst lim sue lin says. earnings hit cimb niagas gross npl ratio inched up to 3.4% as at end-september  higher than the industry average  from 2.3% a year ago, arising from a large corporate account relating to the mining sector. the lenders provisions in the third quarter rose 157.8% from the second quarter to idr941 billion. its nine-month net profit, at idr2.296 trillion, was down 28.5% year on year and accounted for a mere 53.9% of analysts full-year profit estimate for the lender. hence, it came as no surprise when parent company cimb group reported disappointing earnings last week. its net profit for the third quarter ended sept 30 fell 16.1% y-o-y and 6.3% q-o-q to rm890.27 million, hurt mainly by the high provisions at cimb niaga as well as the weaker capital markets. for the first nine months, net profit was 17% lower at rm2.91 billion, making up just 67% of analysts profit estimate for the group for the full year. excluding one-off items in the previous nine months, the fall in the groups net profit was smaller, at 7.4%. if cimb niaga were removed from the equation, the rest of the group would actually have grown 6%. cimb niaga accounted for 22% of cimb groups nine-month pre-tax profit compared with 31% in the same period last year. as always, it was the malaysian operations that contributed the most to the groups bottom line, at 69% so far this year, followed by its other big markets of indonesia, singapore (6%) and thailand (5%). the group said its 13.5% to 14% return on equity target for this year would not be met, given the challenging outlook for indonesia. cimb group chairman datuk seri nazir razak, who is also president commisioner of cimb niaga, acknowledges that the going will be tough in indonesia. the operating environment in indonesia is indeed very challenging at the moment, but one has to accept this kind of potential volatility when investing in most less-developed markets. when we first invested in indonesia in 2002, the markets punished us and a few years ago, the markets gave us a big premium for our large indonesian exposure. the tide has turned again, driven by the decline in the rupiah, the end of the commodity boom and tougher operating conditions, especially for banks outside the top four that have a huge funding advantage because the rupiah wholesale market lacks depth, he tells the edge. but nazir says indonesia remains a fundamentally attractive long-term story and that the country is an essential component of cimbs asean banking franchise. we will just ride out this period of higher credit charges and tight rupiah liquidity. how long it will last will depend on the resolve of the new governments leadership to tackle the twin deficits and regain the confidence of the business sector. if the jokowi administration handles the short-term challenges and then quickly moves on to the infrastructure bottlenecks, the markets would turn bullish on indonesia quite fast. no one is banking on a recovery in commodity prices, so i think the key for indonesia will be infrastructure and fdi (foreign direct investment). as for bii, its nine-month earnings, at idr339.7 billion, were down 69.1% from a year ago as provisions increased 151% to idr1.46 trillion. its asset quality deteriorated with gross npl ratio sliding to 2.55% as at end-september from 1.55% a year ago. biis weak performance is likely to weigh on maybanks third-quarter results, analysts say. maybank is expected to release its results this week. alliancedbs researchs lim estimates biis nine-month contribution to the maybank group to be negligible. it has indeed been a tough year for foreign banks operating in indonesia this year, she observes in an oct 30 report. maybanks rafique says asset quality will continue to be a key concern for bii going into 2015 as a result of the higher projected interest rates and inflation. but the group hopes to see an improvement at bii towards the second half of 2015. the groups biggest challenge in indonesia at the moment is the squeeze on margins. the banking industry continues to face pressure on margins as it is increasingly challenging to source for low-cost funds, especially with expectation of rising interest rates and higher inflation due to the increase in fuel prices, says rafique. however, the governments plan to reduce the fuel subsidy may have a positive impact on loan growth, particularly in working capital and investment, as the government is expected to shift its focus to utilising fiscal expenditure from the fuel subsidy to infrastructure development and investment. bii has carried out a series of strategic initiatives to improve its performance, he says. meanwhile, despite the uncertainties in indonesia, analysts are mostly calling a buy on maybank, mainly for its dividend appeal. bloomberg data shows that of at least 25 analysts tracking the stock, 20 have a buy call on it and a 12-month target price of rm11.03. the stock, which has gained just 1.7% so far this year, closed at rm9.56 last thursday. as for cimb, of at least 21 analysts, nine have a hold call on it and six each a buy and sell call. the stock has fallen sharply since the group released its third-quarter results last tuesday, closing at an over four-year low of rm5.90 on thursday. it has declined about 20% so far this year. this article first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly, on

purchasers company. the negotiations are being conducted at shareholder level, said the source. nonetheless, it might not be easy for the tycoon to find a buyer given the current cautious sentiment on the o&g sector, particularly the offshore support vessel (osv) segment where overcapacity is likely to weigh down on charter rates. it is not known at what price the tycoon intends to part with his shares as bumi armadas share price has plunged sharply in the past six months. the companys net assets per share was at rm1.57 as at sept 30. based on yesterdays closing price of rm1.16, aks shares are worth some rm2.4 billion, compared with a possible rm5.2 billion when bumi armada shares were trading at their peak early this year. year-to-date, the stock has fallen 53%, wiping out some rm8 billion from the companys market capitalisation and leaving it with rm6.8 billion as at yesterday. bumi armadas share price has been on a downtrend since june when news broke that the company was facing problems with its african operations, particularly in angola. the company has been expanding its fleet in africa. currently, it has six vessels going into angola, five in congo and 11 in nigeria. it is currently the worlds fifth largest fpso player with seven vessels in hand. the group also has a large osv fleet consisting of about 51 vessels. the share price plunged further when ak

may not be right in the company. nevertheless, ananda is still the companys largest shareholder through his private vehicle. other major shareholders include the employees provident fund with 8.27%,

resignation effective jan 1, 2015. although he still acts as a consultant to the company until 2016, hassans departure came as a surprise to many as he is still the ideal person to steer the company,

interests in several oilfields in vietnam from petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) is seen favourably by analysts in the oil and gas sector, who say the price tag of us$400 million (rm1.3 billion) is attractive even in a low oil price environment. in an announcement last week, the group says it had proposed to acquire a 50% stake in blocks 01/97 and 02/97 (known as cuu long basin), 36.8% in block 46-cn (cai nuoc), and 40% in blocks 10 and 11.1 (nam con son basin). the first two are oil and gas producing blocks while the third is an exploration block. petronas is said to have put its stakes in the three blocks up for sale earlier this year. after the international bidding exercise, sapurakencana entered into three conditional sales and purchase agreements with the national oil firm with regard to the assets. the vietnam assets are estimated to have further upside as sapurakencana will be able to ramp up production in the fields located in cuu long basin as well as potentially make discoveries in the exploration field at nam con son basin. sapurakencana president and group ceo tan sri shahril shamsuddin says in a statement that the transaction gives the group an immediate foothold in the promising oil provinces off the shores of vietnam, with cash generating assets that will be earnings accretive to the group. he adds that the acquisition of interests in the three blocks marks a significant milestone for the group as it further strengthens its presence in vietnam by adding exploration and production operations to its existing service operations. the values of the assets were first estimated by wood mackenzie, a firm that assesses oil blocks. in july, wood mackenzie released a report assessing the worth of only two fields in one of the blocks in the aforementioned vietnam assets. the firm estimated that the thang long and dong do fields located in block 01/97 and 02/97 will contribute total company cash flow of about us$480 million across a period of 12 years (from 2014 to 2025). the production sharing contract (psc) concession for this block ends in 2028. however, the us$480 million, which will be pocketed by sapurakencana, is only half of the deal. the cuu long basin, where the thang long and dong do fields are located, also has another field called ho xam south. wood mackenzie did not take into consideration ho xam south or the other two blocks  cai nuoc and nam con son basin  since at the time of publication, the fields were either not producing or did not have concrete details. the cuu long basin appears to be the gem in the asset as it has three oil-producing fields  thang long, dong do and ho xam south. the fields were producing about 8,800 barrels of oil per day (bopd) in september and have total reserves of about 43 million barrels. in 2015, production is expected to be ramped up to 18,000 bopd. as for cai nuoc, it is a smaller field with less production. it is currently producing about 900 bopd and 23 million standard cu ft per day of gas. the field has been producing since 2003 and the psc will expire in august 2015. an extension is subject to negotiation between sapurakencana and vietnams national oil firm petrovietnam. meanwhile, the potential discoveries and production of nam con son basin, which is an exploration field, are yet unknown, although some prospects have been identified. assuming that sapurakencana makes a discovery, it could add more worth to the total asset. the acquisition of the vietnam assets contributes further to sapurakencanas already increasing reserves and resources. at the start of the year, sapurakencana had reserves and resources of about 104 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe). after the five discoveries in sk408 announced in september, its reserves doubled to 208 mmboe. the integration of the vietnam assets will now see sapurakencana having total reserves and resources of 225 mmboe. additionally, since the vietnam assets are already producing oil, sapurakencana is also expected to see its cash flow increase with time. according to kenanga researchs cezzane see, the vietnamese acquisition has producing assets, hence will translate into immediate cash flow that will be utilised to pay off the borrowings that come with the acquisition, which is 100% debt financed. from a balance sheet perspective, see says the borrowings for the vietnam fields will spur net gearing, but sapurakencana is certain that payback will be swift given strong cash flows from the producing assets. see has given the stock an outperform rating with a target price of rm4.24. maybank ib research is of the view that the vietnam blocks are quality assets as they are in production, and has given the stock a buy recommendation and a target price of rm3.80. in a research report, it says the assets offer immediate cash flows and earnings visibility of about us$200 million earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) per annum over the next seven years. sapurakencanas share price closed at rm3.11 last friday, giving it a market capitalisation of rm18.64 billion. previously, petronas vietnam assets were speculated to have attracted big names such as tycoon ananda krishnans pexco group and tan sri mokhzani mahathir. in the may 22 issue of the edge, sources said that ananda was mulling over the listing of pexco on bursa

represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since may 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of

1,766.22 (low), 1,858.09 (high), 1,805.35 (low) and 1,827.40 (high). most of the indexs daily signals have turned negative (except stochastic) recently. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at 1,766, 1,805 and 1,817, while the resistance areas of 1,822, 1,858 and 1,896 would offer very heavy liquidation and profit-taking activities. the klcis 18 and 40 simple moving averages (sma)

40 smas. therefore, the recent rebound from the 1,766.22 low has obviously stalled at 1,858.09. this has opened up downside possibilities for the index once again. due to the uncertain tone for the klci, we are recommending a chart sell on airasia x bhd (aax). aax recently announced its third quarter of financial year 2014 (3qfy14) results. according to our fundamental analyst, the 3qfy14 core net loss was greater than estimated by the industry. the disappointing result was attributed to low yields due to overcapacity which aax will reduce its capacity growth in fy14 to fy16 by deferring and selling aircraft. our analyst has an unchanged sell call on aax with a rm0.57 target price. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that 11 research houses cover aax. of these, there is a single buy call, four hold calls and six sell calls on the stock. this company is currently loss-making with its price-to-book value ratio at 1.68 times indicating a premium to its book value and its debt-to-equity ratio is at 161.5%. aaxs chart trend on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames is very firmly down. its share price made a decline since its major weekly wave-2 high of rm1.23 in august 2013. since that rm1.23 high, aax fell to its november 2014 all-time low of rm0.61. as prices broke below their recent key critical support levels of rm1 and rm0.69, look to sell aax on any rebounds to its resistance areas as the mas depict very firm short- to medium-term downtrends for this stock. the daily and weekly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, oscillator and stochastic) have issued sellsignals and now depict very firm indications of aaxs eventual move towards much lower levels. it would attract firm selling activities at the resistance levels of rm0.615, rm0.69 and rm1.

the sharp year-on-year decline in ioi corps downstream resource-based manufacturing earnings before interest and tax was similar to lower refining contribution of its peers. the lower contribution was

however, its q-o-q revenue was down 5% due to seasonal factors. gabs 1qfy6/15 earnings before interest and tax (ebit) grew at a slower pace of 10% y-o-y due to higher excise duty and sales tax payments and higher advertising and promotions (a&p). to recap, the former was due to the change in valuation method for excise duty effective nov 1, 2013. the 1qfy15 ebit, nevertheless, rose 13%

at 10.55am, the counter was trading 31 sen or 8.1% higher at rm4.15, giving it a market capitalisation of rm972.74 million. some 147, 900 units changed hands. eco world yesterday said ewi, spearheaded by tan sri liew kee sin, has proposed to list the entity as a special purpose acquisition company (spac) on bursas main board, and eco world intends to buy a 30% stake in ewi upon the listing. eco world also expressed its interest to subscribe for 1.125 billion shares of 1 sen each in ewi, as well as a similar number of free detachable warrants for rm562.5 billion. in a note to client today, alliance dbs research maintained its buy call for the stock with an unchanged target price of rm3.84. \"we continue to like eco world for the proven and impeccable track record of its key senior

2015 (fy13 to fy15) earnings compounded annual growth rate (cagr) of 78%,\" it said. alliance dbs said with the associate stake in ewi, eco world will be able to venture overseas without excessive

at church street in sydney, australia held by the unlisted eco world will likely be injected into the spac,\" maybank ib said in a note today. \"we are positive on this latest development as the

equity sell-off and a cut to germanys growth forecasts stirred memories of the eurozones sovereign-debt crisis in 2011. a bigger-than-expected drop in us retail sales also ignited concern about the impact of the global slowdown on the american economy. the s&p 500 index plunged 15.21 points to close at 1,862.49 points whilst the dow tumbled 173.45 points to end at 16,141.74. the fbm klci index traded in a wider range of 41.18 points for the week with lower volumes of 1.81 billion to 2.58 billion shares traded. the index closed at 1,767.77 points on oct 16, down 19.07 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks such as axiata group bhd, cimb group holdings bhd, genting bhd, sapurakencana petroleum bhd and umw holdings bhd caused the index to fall on persistent selling activities. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements, since may 2013, have been trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69 (high), 1,802.88 (low), 1,896.23 (high), 1,837.28 (low) and 1,879.62 (high). all the indexs daily signals turned negative recently. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at 1,700, 1,727 and 1,759, while the resistance areas of 1,767 and 1,800 and 1,829 would offer heavy liquidation and selling activities. the klcis simple-moving averages (18, 40 and 20) depict an emerging downtrend for its daily and weekly charts. with the prices breaking below the larger and lower rising wedge support line on sept 15, 2014, we foresee longer-term selling activities for the index. the selling pressure would be intense and persistent if and when the index rebounds. downside targets for this move are at 1,730 (in the short term) and 1,682 (in the medium term). due to the softer tone for the klci index, we are recommending a chart sell on british american tobacco (m) bhd (bat). bat turned into downtrend since hitting its recent 52-week high of rm73.48 in august 2014. at maybank investment bank bhd, our fundamental analyst has an unchanged sell call on bat and target price of rm62. in a surprise move in early september 2014, bat announced an 8% to 9% price hike per cigarette box. this was its third price increase in just over a year, but bat reversed its decision after two weeks. despite the surprising u-turn to pre-sept 8 price hikes, our analysts forecast remains unchanged as he had expected higher operating costs and assumed a larger 12% year-on-year volume contraction will mitigate the higher revenue from the price hike. with the reversion of the price hike, our analyst currently assumes a 6% per annum contraction. a check of the bloomberg consensus reveals that 17 research houses have coverage on bat. of the 17, there are only two buy calls, seven hold calls and eight sell calls. this stock currently trades at expensive price-to-earnings ratio of 21.6 times while its price-to-book value ratio of 34.9 times indicates that its share price is trading at a premium to its book value. the reported shareholding changes on bloomberg revealed net selling by mostly foreign institution funds over the past month. bats chart trend on the daily time frame is very weak and is firmly down. its share price made a large plunge since its daily wave-5 and recent all-time high of rm73.48 in august 2014. since that rm73.48 high, bat plunged to its recent october 2014 low of rm65.14. as prices broke above their recent key critical support levels of rm71.50 and rm71.20, look to sell bat on any rebound to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to medium-term downtrends for this stock. the daily indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) have issued sell signals and now depict very firm indications of bats eventual move towards much lower levels. it would attract very weak buying interest at the support levels of rm63.05, rm65.14 and rm65.50. we expect bat to attract major liquidation towards its resistance levels of rm66.72, rm71.20 and rm71.50. its downside targets are located at rm62.75, rm61.90 and rm56.90.  \nlee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at

bank (june 17): we expect indonesia to remain the main driver for ijmps overall fresh fruit bunch (ffb) output growth, underpinned by more planted areas reaching maturity (5,000ha to 8,000ha a year over the next three years). we projected overall ffb production to grow 10% to 13% in fy03/15-17 (versus 9.3% to 10% previously), underpinned by a 26% to 43% increase in ffb production in indonesia over the next three years. we are raising our fy03/15-16 net profit forecasts by 5.3% and 12% respectively, largely to account for higher ffb yield and lower production cost assumptions for its indonesian operations. based on our sensitivity analysis, every rm100 per tonne increase in our average cpo price assumption will raise our fy03/15-17 net profit forecasts by 8.3% to 8.6%. we raise our target price on the stock by 12.1% to rm3.81, based on unchanged 17 times revised fy03/16 eps of 22.4 sen. although we like its strong balance sheet and young age profile, we believe ijmps strong

alliance on june 17 as it thinks the proposed vessel-pooling accord will restrict competition on the busiest asia-europe routes. the p3 members (maersk, msc and cma cgm) have announced that the p3 plan will now be scrapped. despite its solid earnings delivery and strong non-p3 volume growth, westports share price performance has been lacklustre since its listing in october 2013 because of concerns about p3. given the latest development, we believe westports will see an overdue re-rating. it trades at an implied forward per of 18 times, below its regional peers average of 22 times. we

per share of 7 sen, in line with our forecast. we think that top glove has been able to contain its operating costs quite well through aggressive cost-optimisation initiatives. this can be seen from the stronger ebitda margin, although it was impacted by the large foreign exchange loss in 9mfy14. the higher ebitda margin was also driven by higher sales contribution from nitrile. sapurakencana

the groups huge borrowings of rm388.2 million (as at march 31, 2014) against that amount leaves us with a residual of rm658.5 million, valuing can-one at rm3.43 per share on the enlarged share base.

(thailand) co ltd (somt), for a total cash consideration of us$162.9 million (rm522.9 million). the disposals are expected to be completed this month. the disposals do not come as a surprise, as sime darby sold off its malaysian power plant in april for rm300 million in a bid to dispose of its non-core assets. we maintain our sum-of-parts (sop)-based fair value of rm10.40 and our neutral recommendation. although we are still positive on the plantation sector as a whole, the weaknesses at sime darbys heavy equipment and motor division could be a threat to earnings growth, despite its sensitivity to crude palm oil (cpo) prices. hence, we advocate shifting away from the more integrated players to the purer planters, which would benefit more significantly from cpo price movements. sarawak cable bhd\nfair value: rm1.70 hold \namresearch (june 17): we place our fair value rating for scable under review, pending further details on the proposed acquisitions that were announced yesterday. scable has accepted a conditional offer from hng capital sdn bhd for the former to purchase 100% equity interests in universal cable (m) bhd and leader cable industry bhd for rm210 million. the offer will fortify scable as the leading cable manufacturer in the country with an estimated market share of more than 50%. we understand that following the acquisition, scable will essentially supply all the cables for the 500kv job on a consolidated basis. the acquiree companies are two of the top suppliers in peninsular malaysia. margins are likely to be similar with that of scables existing power cable business. note that non-independent and non-executive director datuk seri hng bok san is the controlling shareholder of hng. if accepted, we expect the share sale agreement to be finalised within 3q before scable seeks shareholders approval in an extraordinary general meeting. hong leong industries bhd \ntarget price: rm6.86 trading buy\nuob kay hian (june 16): hli and narra will seek shareholders approval for a series of restructuring exercises, which will see a backdoor listing of hlis infrastructure business into narra. we see a trading buy opportunity as there could be significant upside to our sum-of-parts (sop) valuation should narras current implied valuation hold up. the implied post-exercise value of narra at rm4.49 per hli share is well above our rm2.30 for hli. narras implied post-exercise market cap is rm2 billion, implying a share price of rm4.16. while we doubt narras present lofty valuation can sustain after the exercise, we acknowledge that it could fetch a valuation that is significantly above our appraised valuation. should narras valuation hold up after the restructuring, our adjusted sop valuation and target price for hli would be rm10.39 and rm9.26 respectively. this compares with our target price of rm6.86, which assumes narra shares at rm2.30 per hli share and a 20% holding company discount to our sop valuation of rm5.70 for hlis remaining assets. alliance financial group bhd \ntarget price: rm5.40 buy\naffin investment bank (june 17): we are of the view that afgs stock price decline is overdone since news of alliance bank malaysia group ceos resignation was made public on june 5. the banking group is backed by a solid management team and has a proven track record in the delivery of results and its relationship management. management is striving to achieve key performance indicators for fy15 by replicating fy14s loan growth of 14.1% y-o-y in fy15e, and achieving a higher return on equity of above 14% in fy15e. with the share price correction, which has provided investors an upside of 15% to our target price of rm5.40, we revise our rating from add to buy. we continue to like the stock, given the attractive dividends, with a net yield of 4.8% to 5.8% in fy15-fy17, subsequent to a slight increase in the payout ratio from 50% to 60% (which was announced during the last results quarter). management is more proactive and will continue to focus on achieving near-term strategic priorities, such as a 30% non-interest income ratio. malaysia airports holdings bhd\ntarget price: rm10.55 buy\nhong leong investment bank (june 16): mahb released weak statistics for may, showing passenger movement growth of only 2.1% y-o-y, owing to the impact of the mh370 crisis and kidnappings in sabah, capacity rationalisation (especially on domestic routes) and high base effect (strong traffic during the election in may 2013). nevertheless, year-to-date passenger growth remained strong at 13.5% y-o-y versus hlibs forecasted +12.8% y-o-y for fy14. klia experienced a decrease of -11% on china sector routes alone (about 10% of the overall passenger movement) after the mh370 and kidnapping of chinese incidents. we believe mas as the main airline operator in klias main terminal building (-3.2% y-o-y in may) severely affected mahb. since mid-may, local airlines  mas, airasia group (including airasia x) and malindo  have been aggressive in their marketing campaigns to fill up increasing flight capacity. hence, we expect a recovery in june-july (impact normalisation) and mahb remains the major beneficiary. this story first appeared in the edge weekly edition of june 23-29, 2014.

top gloves sales volume grew by 5% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) in 3q, driven by both latex and nitrile gloves, we think top line could be flattish q-o-q as: (i) average selling prices were adjusted lower (3% q-o-q) on lower rubber input prices; and (ii) the us dollar to ringgit rate declined 2% q-o-q. we expect the china vinyl operation to continue to post losses, albeit lower q-o-q.\nwhile top gloves share price has fallen 19% since march this year, the stock lacks rerating catalysts. its 3q results could fall short of consensus and an earnings rebound is unlikely to materialise over the next three to six months, especially since the group has yet to adjust its average selling prices to reflect the 19% gas tariff hike effective may 1. margins, as such, remain under pressure.\nwe understand that top glove has secured two reputable customers for the new nitrile lines it added last year. overall plant utilisation stands at approximately 73% and the utilisation rate of its nitrile lines is in excess of 80% (optimal: 90%).\ntop glove has delayed the commencement of its factory 27 (phase 2) and 29 by at least six months. the commencement dates have been moved to july and december this year respectively, and total annual capacity will be lifted by just 5%. management attributed this to a construction delay and its intention to match market demand in order to avoid an oversupply situation.\ntop gloves gross margin for nitrile gloves stands at around 20% presently, representing a fall of five percentage points from a year ago. however, it is still above latex gloves gross margins of 15% to 18%.\nover the next two years, we think the margin premium enjoyed by nitrile gloves could diminish and match latex gloves, considering the incoming new nitrile capacity and limited expansion within the latex segment.\nwe maintain our earnings forecasts, which project a flattish earnings per share growth of 4% for fy15 and 2% for fy16 as we expect the erosion in margin to crimp the higher sales volume (fy15: +10% and fy16: 11%). our earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation margin assumptions are 12.1% for fy15 and 11.7% for fy16 (fy13: 13.3%), in view of intensifying competition in the nitrile segment ahead. nitrile glove made up around 23% of total sales volume in 2qfy14.\nin view of its unexciting prospective earnings and limited catalysts, we peg top glove at -1 standard deviation to mean price-earnings ratio of 15 times (from 17 times) to derive our new target price of rm4.70 (from rm6.). the stock still offers a decent dividend yield

objective was the 1,870 and 1.850 support levels. he said the next area of upside was near the 1,890 all time high and ultimately the 1,900 strong psychological resistance. on market breadth, there is a slight negative distribution with weekly decliners beating advancers by a moderate 4 to 3 on a slightly heavier average daily trade of 2 billion shares worth rm2.1 billion, he said. aggressive bulls

armada bhd is not interested in going after the lucrative risk service contracts (rscs) from petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) for now, said its chief executive officer hassan basma. we did want to participate [in an rsc] at one stage. but then we decided that perhaps its something that we will look into in the future, rather than now, said hassan in an interview withthe edge financial daily. the name itself [risk service contract] says its not a bed of roses, he added. rather, hassan said bumi armada will focus on its core competency, that of a floating solutions provider. besides, we are selective because we want to compete on competency, rather than price. we can add tremendous amount of value [to the jobs we procure]. our game is to be selective and create value, he added. bumi armada can be fastidious with local jobs. though hassan said he is keen to partner with petronas and has done so, bumi armadas revenue from its malaysian operations averaged only 22.09% for the past three years. we have operations in 19 countries across five continents. a lot of our revenue comes from africa, central asia, angola and brazil, he said. nonetheless, with malaysia being bumi armadas backyard, hassan said the group is a good partner to petronas and is keen to work with the state-owned giant. were capable and we are financially sound and we can add tremendous value to them. we are keen to work with them, he said. bumi armadas financials for the first quarter ended march 31, 2014 (1qfy14) showed it had a net gearing of 0.86 times, when imputing total borrowings of rm4.55 billion minus cash and cash equivalents worth rm744.22 million. its total equity stood at rm4.41 billion. hassan believes that a gearing level of below one times is prudent. thus, to partly fund its capital expenditure (capex) in the coming years, bumi armada has opted to make a cash call instead. on monday, the group announced a combination of rights and bonus issues, in which bumi armada is seeking to raise up to rm2.25 billion through the former, largely for its capex programme of rm1.76 billion. hassan said bumi armada will undertake a fleet-renewal programme of a premium level in order to meet the requirements of the international markets. some of the vessels are getting older. today, there is a lot of concern on fuel efficiency and carbon emissions. with the fleet renewal, we come into the market with new requirements, which will most likely be high-end vessels. in the north sea, for example, there is what is called emission control. if you cant satisfy a certain level (of emission level), you cant even come in. its the same with australia, the gulf of mexico and brazil. we need to be a part of this, said hassan. going forward, he sees bumi armada operating a smaller fleet, though it will be of the high-end kind. the group plans to purchase five new vessels this year. currently, there are 52 vessels in its fleet with 12 earmarked for renewal. to service the industry, we want about 60-plus vessels comprising a mix of vessels, instead of just offshore support vessels (osvs) to give us more leverage in the market, said hassan. a total of rm80 million has been allocated for its osv division. meanwhile, the bulk of the capex portion u2013 at rm1.4 billion u2013 from its proposed one-for-two rights issue proceeds will be used for its floating production, storage and offloading (fpso) segment. in a report dated may 26, 2014, maybank ib research said while there is setback at its osv operations, the proposed rights issue reflects much optimism on its fpso division. the research house noted that bumi armada had submitted four fpso bids in ghana, mexico, namibia and indonesia. they are worth us$3 billion (rm9.66 billion) in capex and there are six more bids in the pipeline with capex of us$10 billion. maybank has a buy call on bumi armada at rm3.90, with a target price of rm4.55. this indicates a 25% upside on its closing price of rm3.64 yesterday. bloomberg data showed the average target price given by analysts is rm4.37, with 12 out of 20 analysts giving the stock a buy call. seven of them recommended investors to hold the stock.this article first

palm prices would get a boost from an el nino climate shift and cling to 3,000 ringgit per tonne beyond june, possibly hitting 3,500 ringgit per tonne later in the year, if the crop-damaging weather

are still waiting for more details on the 1q14 results from its analyst briefing this afternoon. based on its disclosure, 1q14 earnings from power generation declined 10% to php3.8 billion, mainly due to the higher steam cost in tiwi-makban.  earnings also declined due to the expiration of the income tax holiday of the pagbilao plant. this was partially mitigated by higher sales to the spot market as the company took advantage of higher spot prices, which improved 16% y-o-y. meanwhile, earnings from power distribution declined 17%, brought about by a 6.1% decline in distribution margin to php1.53 per kwh, mainly due to the lag in the recovery of purchased power in visayan electric company.  we have a buy rating on aboitiz power and a fair value estimate of php44.30 per share. at its current market price of php36.35 per share, potential appreciation to our fair value estimate is significant at 21.9%. although the companys earnings are still expected to decline this year, given the

below its breakeven point of us$8.80 per barrel. on the flipside, the 14 and 23-day shutdowns at its refining and lube base plants trimmed the entire complexs utilisation rate. refining utilisation fell slightly to 80% from 4q13s 81%. more substantially, aromatics and olefins run rates declined to 85% and 97% respectively, from 89% and 111% in 4q13. as we dont expect extra gains to recur in

represents 23% of our full-year projection. with earnings expected to decline q-o-q in 2q14, we expect some cuts in street earnings forecast. irpcs share price has slipped 5.4% since our recent rating

101.4% of our forecast. however, lower margins resulted in profit after tax and minority interest declining 1.6% to s$266 million, making up 99.1% of our forecast. the s$44 million increase in expenditure came mainly from higher staff, sub-contracting and material costs. this was partly compensated by higher profits seen in associates and jvs, which increased 8.3% to s$162.6 million, representing 61% of sias net profit. the main contributors were the engine repair and overhaul centres, which accounted for s$125 million of the profit. a final ordinary and special dividend of 13 singapore cents and 5 cents respectively were recommended, bringing full-year dividends to 25 cents. management guided that the third hangar at clark base (the philippines) is expected to come onstream in june. with this new hangar, clark bases capacity is expected to double. as the two existing clark base hangars are already fully utilised, we expect the third hangar to start contributing to earnings in 2hfy15.  incorporating the latest results, we maintain a hold rating on sia but raise our fair value slightly from s$4.77 to s$4.83 based on 19 times fy15 eps of 25.4 cents. assuming a 90% payout ratio, we expect fy15f dividend yield to be reasonably attractive at 4.7%. silverlake axis ltdtarget price: s$0.96 accumulatephillip capital (may 7): silverlake axis announced its 3q14 results on may 6. net profit for the quarter grew 33% y-o-y to rm63 million, driven by growth in maintenance and enhancement services as well as sales of software and hardware products. sales benefited from two large orders for hardware products. maintenance and enhancement services continue to grow steadily with new project enhancement contracts secured in singapore and thailand.  the increase in profit was also a result of higher software licensing and a new recurring revenue stream from insurance processing by merimen group, offset by a drop in project services due to fewer project implementation contracts in progress in 3q14. an interim dividend of one singapore cents per share was proposed, bringing the total fy14 interim dividends to 2.7 cents, 35% higher than the previous year.  we continue to be positive on silverlake axis as it has excellent growth potential in our view. perceived downside risks include the absence of new customer acquisition and a lack of major contract wins to support current growth. however, it will still continue to enjoy growth from its maintenance and enhancement services.  we revise our discounted cash flow valuation with a more achievable projected growth rate, maintaining an accumulate rating with a revised target price of 96 cents. we continue to like silverlake axis for its investment merits. this story first appeared in

2010 to boost banks capital-adequacy ratios and give them an extra buffer against losses following the global financial crisis that started in 2008. bonds that comply with the regulations are typically higher-yielding as they can be written down if local regulators deem the issuing lender non-viable. worldwide sukuk sales have increased 8.4 percent to $17.2 billion so far in 2014, data

sen or 1% to rm9.72. the seventh top loser saw 763,800 shares changed hands. it had earlier fallen to a low of rm9.70. but cimb investment bank research in a note today said it maintained an add call for genting with an unchanged target price (tp) of rm13.10. the research house also maintained its earnings per share forecast. although the issue of rwlv competing in a crowded landscape has always been a factor, the group has shown that it can successfully operate in the us with its new york property. rwlv could also support potential plans for a listing of its us assets, said analyst lucius chong of cimb ib. chong noted the 749 million genting warrants issued in the fourth quarter last year would raise us$1.8 billion in capital for rwlv. while cimb ib remains optimistic, maybank investment bank research said \"it is still early days\" and thus has maintained hold for genting with an unchanged tp of rm10.22. maybank ib's research analyst yin shao yang said: while potentially lucrative, we note that las vegas strips gross gaming revenue growth has been sluggish u2013 up 5% year-on-year in 2013. our estimates could be at risk if it does not grow fast enough to accommodate rwlv, he cautioned."}, "448": {"date_posted": "9/5/2014", "title": "a moody may", "article": " asian stock markets remained volatile as technology sector stocks in japan and the us fluctuated throughout the week while investors weighed corporate earnings for the first quarter of financial year 2014. investors remained cautious about the concern that the slowdown in china is deepening. in the us on wednesday, the dow jones industrial average rebounded after federal reserve chairman janet yellen said the us economy still needed help. the sp 500 index rose 10.49 points to close at 1,878.21 points while the dow gained 117.52 points to end at 16,518.54. the fbm klci traded in a narrow range of 16.07 points for the week with high volumes of 1.54 billion to 1.81 billion shares done. the index closed at 1,862.84 yesterday, up 2.41 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like british american tobacco (m) bhd, astro malaysia holdings bhd, hong leong financial group bhd, kuala lumpur kepong bhd and genting bhd caused the index to rise on some nibbling activities. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the price movements in the index in the next few months following may 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69 (high), 1,802.88 (low) and 1,871.69 (high). the indexs daily signals were mixed, with upbeat cci, dmi and oscillator but negative macd and stochastic signals. as such, the indexs weaker support levels were seen at 1,802, 1,821 and 1,853, while the resistance areas of 1,862, 1,871 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some very heavy selling activities. its simple moving averages depict a neutral trend for its daily chart, which may turn down on some further potential selling. due to its mixed chart signals, we believe investors will now turn towards a sell on rallies tone for the klci. due to the uncertain tone for the klci for may 2014, we are recommending a chart sell on yinson holdings bhd, which announced its fourth quarter ended jan 1, 2014 (4qfy14) results in february. the groups business units are organised into four operating segments  marine, transport, trading and other operations. its full fy14 profit before tax increased by 81.1% year-on-year to rm80.4 million compared with rm44.4 million in fy13. the increased profitability was attributed to a rise in the marine segment, joint ventures and other operations segment. the higher profit was partly offset by a decrease in contribution from the trading segment due to a drop in gross margin, an increase in net borrowing expenses and share of losses from associates. a check of bloomberg consensus reveals that five research houses have coverage on the stock. of the five, three have buy calls, one hold and one sell. the stock is currently trading at a high historical price-earnings ratio of 24.6 times and at a very high price-to-book value of 3.9 times. looking at the current reported shareholding changes on bloomberg, we observe that its top 30 shareholders did not do any major buying or selling recently. yinsons chart trend on the daily time frame is much weaker. its share price made an obvious plunge since its daily wave-5 high of rm9.22 on march 13. since that rm9.22 high, it declined to its recent may 2014 low of rm7.78. yinsons chart has moved into strong daily downtrends to its recent may 2014 low of rm7.78. as it broke above its recent key critical support levels of rm8.51 and rm8.45, look to sell yinson on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to medium term downtrends for this stock. the daily indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) are very weak and now depict the firm indications of yinsons eventual move towards much lower levels. we expect yinson to attract heavy selling towards its resistance levels of rm7.81, rm8.45 and rm8.51. it will attract very weak nibbling activities at the support levels of rm6.93, rm7.25 and rm7.78. its downside targets are now located at rm7.25, rm6.90 and rm6.17. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng.

(+13% year-on-year [y-o-y]; +4% quarter-on-quarter [q-o-q]) represents 25% of both our and consensus full-year forecasts.  the sharp y-o-y growth is mainly due to a base effect (the regasification

skyrocketed to rm36.4 million from rm173,000 in the year before, while revenue rose to rm970.0 million from rm900 million. the significant improvement in profit before tax for the quarter and financial year-to-date was mainly due to higher revenue, higher margin products and appreciation of the us dollar against the ringgit. looking ahead, mpi anticipates its performance will improve further in the final quarter of the financial year. eversendai corporation bhd said it recently secured several contracts for structural steel projects worth rm172.2 million via its subsidiaries in

friday. the visit also included [emailprotected] mall, a joint venture project between wct holdings bhd (70%) and mahb (30%). the entire site requires some finishing touches and we think it will take another two months before it is 100% ready. nonetheless, the airport and the shopping mall will be able to commence operations on may 2. fears of cracks on the runway and apron have been proven unfounded, and the entire site looks wonderful so to speak. we were impressed. firstly, klia2 (estimated capital expenditure of rm4 billion) is not a low-cost terminal by any sense of the word. it is a fully-equipped terminal with all the functionality and comforts of a world-class airport terminal. full service carriers will have no problem shifting their operations there, as all the required amenities are available. for the low-cost carriers (lcc), klia2 provides them with a platform for high and uninterrupted growth, with the opportunity to boost their service levels. the klia2 concept puts a high emphasis on retail, so much so that we can agree with its airport-within-a-mall concept. it has the highest retail floor space composition of any airport globally. there are two elements of retail, the [emailprotected] mall and air-side retailers. the combined retail floor space amounts to 67,516mu00b2 (35,000mu00b2 at air-side and 32,516mu00b2 at gateway), which is almost on par with the entire retail space of all the three terminals at changi airport in singapore. we believe klia2 is a major positive for mahb and wct, as both companies will start reaping the fruits of their labour. klia2 is also positive for airasia x bhd (aax), as it will help to enhance customer experience while the terminal layout will enable aax to harness on transit passengers more efficiently and cheaply. airasia bhd will also benefit as the terminal provides an uninterrupted platform to grow and enhance its customer experience. during our visit to klia2, it was evident that some cosmetic touch-ups and other construction works were still outstanding. these shortcomings however will not be disruptive to operations and will not hamper the may 2 opening. this is a positive development as we initially forecast sept 1, 2014 as our base case opening date. malindo air will take the honours as the first airline to land at klia2 on may 2 with a flight from kota kinabalu landing at 12:05am. cebu pacific air will be the first airline to take off from klia2, via a flight to manila at 1:30am. we raise our earnings forecast for mahb for financial year 2014 ending dec 31 (fy14) by 1.2% to impute the earlier launch date. however, our sell recommendation and target price of rm7.03 are unchanged as our valuation uses fy15 as the base year. the target price is based on 10.3 times 2015 enterprise value/earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, which is a 10% premium to global peers after considering mahbs strong traffic growth potential. the stock is expensive with a high debt burden relative to its peer group.  maybank ib research, april 28 this article first appeared in the edge financial daily, on april 29, 2014."}, "464": {"date_posted": "24/4/2014",

announce its results for the first quarter ended march 31 of financial year 2014 (1qfy14)  will likely focus on three key issues: (i) status of klia2 and its final project cost; (ii) status of the passenger service charge (psc) that was due for an increase on feb 12, 2014; and (iii) updates on the acquisition of sabiha gu00f6ku00e7en airport in istanbul, turkey. mahb enjoyed a healthy passenger traffic growth of 18.4% year-on-year (y-o-y) in 1qfy14, which was slightly ahead of our 15% growth expectation for the quarter. however, we expect passenger traffic growth to moderate to 10% to 12% for the rest of the year due to the disappearance of flight mh370, which we expect will negatively impact short-term demand and also the effect of a higher base in 2013 (+18.4% y-o-y). our concerns remain centred on klia2  that is, whether it will match its budget of rm4 billion and whether it will enjoy a higher psc compared with the current rate charged at the low-cost carrier terminal. we are also concerned about rising costs as mahb has struggled to contain operational costs for the past three quarters. we keep our earnings forecasts, sell recommendation and target price of rm7.03 unchanged. the target price is based on 10.3 times 2015 enterprise value/earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, which is a 10% premium to global peers to reward mahb for its

stock markets rose slightly amidst an advance in technology shares as well as a firmer than expected us march factory output figure. the sp 500 index surged 19.33 points to close at 1,862.31 points while the dow gained 162.29 points to end at 16,424.85 on wednesday night. however, chinas first quarter gross domestic product growth slowed to the most sluggish pace in six quarters, while industrial production and fixed asset investment trailed projections. this dampened the asia-pacific market mood after an initial euphoric rise yesterday. the fbm klci traded in a very narrow range of 9.25 points for the week with higher volumes of 2.02 billion to 2.59 billion shares done. the index closed at 1,850.54 yesterday, up 5.17 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like cimb group holdings bhd, genting bhd, malayan banking bhd, petronas dagangan bhd and public bank bhd caused the index to inch up on some institutional buying. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the price movements in the index in the few months following may 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69 (high) and 1,802.88 (low). the indexs daily signals are mixed, with negative stochastic and macd signals but positive cci, dmi and oscillator readings. as such, the indexs obvious support levels are seen at 1,802, 1,839 and 1,850, while the resistance areas of 1,854, 1,862 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some very heavy selling. its simple moving averages depict an emerging uptrend for its weekly and monthly charts. its daily chart had turned neutral this week though. due to its mixed chart signals, we believe investors will change to a range trading mode for the klci. due to the fine tone for the klci, we are recommending a chart buy on yee lee corp bhd, which announced its fourth quarter ended dec 31 of financial year 2013 (4qfy13) and full-year results in february 2014. the group saw its full fy13 revenue declining marginally by 5.9% to rm658.3 million from rm699.7 million in fy12. despite the marginal decline in top line numbers, yee lee recorded a significant 45.2% improvement in profit before tax to rm42.7 million in fy13 from rm29.4 million in fy12. the improved profitability can be attributed to the trading division, which performed exceptionally well in fy13, and the palm oil refinery and mill division which managed to report a turnaround. its subsidiary, spritzer bhd, also recorded a substantial increase in profit contribution to the group to rm6.3 million in fy13 from rm4.4 million in fy12. a check of bloomberg consensus reveals that only two research houses cover the stock with buy calls. the stock is currently trading at a fair historical price-earnings ratio of 9.98 times and reasonable price-to-book value of 1.05 times. yee lee has a low indicative 12-month dividend yield of 1.32%. maybank-ib first featured chart coverage on yee lee on april 10 at rm1.80. its chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames are very strong. its share price made an obvious surge since its daily wave-2 low of rm1.22 on dec 18, 2013. since that rm1.22 low, yee lee surged to its recent april 2014 high of rm1.94. its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to its recent april 2014 high of rm1.94. as it broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of rm1.48 and rm1.73, look to buy yee lee on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to long term uptrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, stochastic and oscillator) are very strong and now depict the firm indications of yee lees eventual move towards much higher levels. we expect yee lee to remain very well sought after on dips towards its support levels of rm1.48, rm1.73 and rm1.90. it may attract minor profit taking at the resistance levels of rm1.94, rm2.07 and rm2.21. its upside targets are now located at rm2.12, rm2.24, rm2.55 and rm2.76. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at maybank kim eng. the views expressed

selling price. revenue from skm in 4q13 reached idr13.7 trillion (up 26.1% y-o-y) while earnings from skt stood at idr1.1 trillion (up 30.3% y-o-y). a hefty interest expense of idr755 billion exerted pressure on fy13 bottom line, which grew 7.8% y-o-y to idr4.3 trillion.  the raw materials-to-sales ratio in 4q13 was stable at 19.7%, compared with 3q13s 19.5%. the excise tax-to-sales ratio fell to 59% in the same quarter from 62% in 3q13. these figures indicate that cost pressures have eased. ggrms fy13 capital expenditure was idr5.4 trillion while its net gearing fell to 39.6%, compared with 9m13s 42.9%. following the full-year results, we increase our 2014/15 earnings projections by 6% per year, mainly on lower interest expense assumptions.  maintain buy with a new target price of idr56,000, up from idr46,500. this implies a 20 times 2014 earnings. our call is premised on ggrms strong revenue growth, easing cost pressure and cheap valuations  at a 22% discount to consumer

part of its capital and balance sheet management. the management says its core return on equity (roe) target for the year is 12%. this suggests fy14 earnings guidance of php5.2 billion (+4% y-o-y), excluding volatile treasury income. secb is also embarking on a five-year marketing plan to boost its retail banking operations. it aims to lift consumer loans to a third of its total loan portfolio from 6% currently.  we have a -3%/-2% change in our fy14/15 net income estimates after factoring in the impact of the tier 2 notes. our assumption is based on a single-tranche format to be issued in 2h14 with a coupon rate of 5.5%. we estimate secbs interest costs will increase 2% and 19% in fy14 and fy15 respectively, compressing net interest margins of 20 basis points (bps) to 3.06% in fy14 and 3bps to 3.03% in fy15. our earnings revision results in roe of 12.1% this year and 13.1% in fy15. secbs share price has fallen 8% year to date, giving investors an upside potential of 15%.  capitaland ltdfair value: s$3.50 buy ocbc investment research (march 31): capitaland (capl) said it has acquired a 60% stake in two adjacent prime residential sites in chengdu, china, for rmb752 million. these parcels have an estimated gross floor area of 479,850 sq m and are located in the tianfu new area, which focuses on advanced manufacturing and high-end service industries.   the acquisitions are subject to approval by the authorities and expected to be completed by 2q14. construction will begin in 2q14 and the first phase will be launched by the end of the year.  the chinese credit markets are experiencing increasing pressure as the authorities opt to let weaker companies go into financial default, and we believe this could present acquisition opportunities for capl as its chinese peers grapple with tightening credit conditions and rising cost of debt. capl enjoys a strong balance sheet with an estimated s$6.9 billion in cash and net gearing of 29% after its recent divestment of australand. maintain buy on capl. pending completion of the acquisitions, we keep our fair value unchanged at s$3.50. pt lippo karawaci tbktarget price: idr1,500 buy rhb research institute (april 1):

healthcare revenue soared 25% y-o-y to idr674 billion in 4q13. on a yearly basis, revenue from its seven existing hospitals grew 21% y-o-y while its nine new hospitals contributed idr485 billion, representing 19% of healthcare revenue. its thin bottom line margin of 2% was impacted by investments and a rapid ramp-up in new hospitals.  our new target price of idr1,500 (from idr1,300) is derived from applying a 30% discount to our rnav estimate of idr2,170, after considering its new hospitals in 2013  including siloam hospitals in bali and tb simatupang, jakarta, as well as two brownfield hospitals in bali  landbank adjustments and higher land sale prices in makassar, and its reduced effective ownerships in siloam hospitals to 78.9% from 86%. maintain buy. china merchants holdings

proceeds to repay debt (55%), fund capital expenditure (40%) and as working capital (5%). its fy13 earnings stood at hk$4.21 billion (+10.3% y-o-y), 3.7% higher than our forecast. recurring earnings grew 18.8% y-o-y.  container throughput increased 18.5% thanks to the terminal link acquisition in mid-fy13.  we revise our fy14f and fy15f earnings by +1.4% and -4.7% respectively to factor in better-than-expected results and impact of the mcs interest costs. we expect throughput to grow 12% for fy14 and 5.2% for fy15. we think there will be no mcs conversion in the near term, so cost for fy14 to fy16 is higher interest expenses. we also think the stocks per of 14 times for fy14f is not demanding compared with its five-year trading range of 10.8 to 27 times.  pacific radiance ltdtarget price: s$1.22 buy uob kay hian (april 1): pacific radiance now offers a 15.1% upside to our target price of s$1.22. our target price is based on a 2015f per of 9.5 times. this is in line with the long-term (2004 to current) one-year forward per mean of 9.5 times for the offshore support vessel (osv)-owner segment of the singapore oilfield services sector.  the sectors overall one-year forward eps growth has been improving since early 2012, but per valuation improvement has lagged.  with a superior management and a virtuous-circle business model, there is case for pacific radiance to trade at a higher per valuation than the long-term per mean. in the singapore osv-owner segment, pacific radiances return on equity of 15% for 2014-16 is the highest after ezions 23%.  the listing of robert kuoks pacc offshore services holdings pte ltd at valuations higher than 2015f per of 9.5 times is likely to lead to a higher target price for pacific radiance. a higher 2015f per of 11 to 12 times

net profit is likely to fall q-o-q; 2q14 service revenue will drop due to a low season. net profit is expected to rebound in 3q14 and rise to the years high in 4q14 thanks to the peak season.  although aiss profit is expected to grow at a slower rate than the sectors average, its expected fy2014 per is 16.6 times, considerably lower than the sectors average of 20.6 times. therefore, aiss

rm731 million at end-fy2012. however, q-o-q growth will likely be flat or marginally softer. overall operating margins should stay above 20% on greater contributions from the high-margin glomac damansara. glomacs 1qfy2013 results are likely to meet our expectations.  we maintain our earnings forecasts and rm1.10 target price (40% discount to revised net asset value) for now. our buy call is based on a 12-month investment horizon. as at april, township projects (including glomac puchong and the newly acquired ijok and dengkil land) account for 82% of glomacs rm5.8 billion in remaining gross development value, providing a strong base for future earnings. glomac is trading at a steep 30% discount to its nta (as at april) and 57% discount to our rm1.82 rnav. it also offers an

as we believe it will continue to face intense competition in the australian routes in the near term following substantial additional capacity by both aax and malaysian airline system bhd in 3qfy13. this is in line with the managements guidance that pressure on its australian yields is expected to persist over the next few quarters.  we are concerned about the potential spill-over effect from the recent mh370 tragedy as it may lead to aversion among chinese tourists to visit malaysia, which may drag aaxs yields further. as such, we are tweaking our yields growth assumption downwards to 2% in fy14 from 5% which was too optimistic, considering the recent developments.  we still believe that aaxs yields will rise slightly in fy14 due to the withdrawal of the poor-yielding maldives route that had affected yields in 4qfy13 and improvement in its jeddah yields as travel demand normalises. we expect aaxs yields to increase by 5% in fy15 following its relocation to klia2.  cypark resources bhd target price: rm3.09 add cimb research (march 31): revenue growth for 1qf14 was flattish as it only grew by 1% to rm51.5 million. this was due to lower revenue from its environmental engineering that

development authority (seda) was expected to release its new re quota under the feed-in-tariff programme (fit) by the end of march. however, news reports suggest that the new quota is only expected by april. cypark is aiming for at least another 10mw of new re quota from seda. 1malaysia development bhds move (1mdb) to be the first to build a solar power plant outside of the fit quota is positive

international holdings, the majority shareholder of jti malaysia, has made a buyout offer of rm808.5 million for the remaining 39.6% stake of jti.  we are pleasantly surprised by the privatisation offer price, which is significantly higher than our previous dividend-discount-model- (ddm) derived target price of rm6. in addition to the offer price, this represents a 20% premium to jtis

estimation per-nta of 5.7 times as at end-december 2013.  in view of the challenging prospects for the tobacco industry and the strong offer on hand, we think that there is no reason for minorities to

astro will continue to enjoy average revenue per user uplift from improving take-up of b.yond hd channels as well as full-year recognition of package price increases. this would also be bolstered by full-year recognition of revenue from astros barclays premier league channel-supply partnership with telekom malaysia bhd. margins are expected to be resilient as its set-up box swap-out exercise

 eastern & oriental bhdfair value: rm3 buy amresearch (april 3): we reaffirm our buy recommendation on eastern & oriental (e&o) with an unchanged fair value of rm3 per share  a 35% discount to our nav of rm4.61 per share, including the significant accretion from seri tanjung pinang 2 (stp2).  a local daily reported that e&os share price has risen to reflect the progress in stp2 and the timeline of events of its stp project. our key investment thesis on e&o is centred on the crystallisation of stp2 given the tripling of nav and the deep development potential of the 760-acre prime land. e&o is awaiting the department of environments approval for the detailed environment impact assessment study on the commencement of reclamation works on stp2. we recommend that investors accumulate e&o ahead of the sustained news flow momentum as stp2 moves closer to realisation. this may lead to a narrowing of the current nav discount of 52% via an accelerated share price discovery of its fair value.padini holdings bhdtarget price: rm2.40 buy hwang dbs vickers research (april 3): padini plans to open three brands outlet (bo) and two padini concept stores (pcs) before end-june. this will add

forecast eps by 3% to 8% after imputing larger earnings contribution from bo and pcs. the near-term earnings growth driver will likely be bo. bo focuses on offering a wide variety of value-for-money products targeted at the low- to middle-income consumers. we believe bo margins are higher given fitting cost is 45% lower than pcs. bo has an impressive track record with five-year pbt cagr of 118%. bo contributed 25% of fy13 revenue. current valuation is attractive at 11 times fy15 eps given the resilient earnings, continuous expansion plans, 25% return on equity and a strong balance sheet. dividends could surprise as expanding bo generally requires lower capital expenditure and costs. our 70% payout ratio for fy14f implies 5% yield. sentoria group bhdtarget price: rm1.20 buy ta

time, benefit from its strong cash-generating leisure and hospitality business.  sentoria is operating in two business divisions, namely property development and leisure and hospitality. the group has around 1,500 acres of undeveloped landbank with an estimated gross development value of rm6.6 billion. the groups leisure and hospitality operation consists of two theme parks and two resorts within

earnings estimates slightly higher by 2.4%. we are assuming lower financing costs from the recently undertaken debt restructuring exercise and also a higher fleet utilisation rate of over 65%. sapurakencanas order book remains strong at us$8.3 billion. broken down geographically, 49% of the jobs are from brazil, 31% from malaysia, 14% from southeast asia, 5% from australia and the rest from africa. tender book value is almost similar to the current order book at rm25 billion.we are still bullish on sapurakencana and we are reiterating our buy recommendation at a revised target price of rm5.36 per share. this is based on fy15 eps of 23.3 sen, pegged to fy15 per of 23 times. our target per is a slight premium to our large-cap sector per of 20 times. uzma bhdtarget price: rm7.30 outperform kenanga research (april 2): uzma and its partner eq petroleum developments malaysia sdn bhd announced that they have signed a small field risk service contract (sfrsc) with petroliam nasional bhd to carry out the development and production of petroleum from the tanjung baram fields for a period of nine years.  the development phase of the entire sfrsc is expected to cost us$100 million and first oil is anticipated in 2015. eq petroleum developments has a 70% stake whilst uzma has a 30% stake in the venture. assuming a 80:20 equity-to-debt ratio; 6% cost of debt and 15 % internal rate of return, we believe uzmas 30% stake will yield accretive earnings of rm5.2 million in fy15. our new target price is rm7.30 is based on an unchanged targeted fy15 per of 16 times. our per is justifiable given that the stock has successfully moved up the value chain instead of just being a service provider. as its share base is pretty illiquid, the share price gains can be significant. this story first appeared in the edge weekly edition of april 07-13, 2014."}, "484": {"date_posted": "14/4/2014", "title": "#interview* telekom eyes no 1 top spot in converged world", "article": " six years after demerging its mobile operations into axiata group bhd, the countrys fixed-line operator telekom malaysia bhd see ms to be back-pedalling by acquiring control of niche fourth-generation (4g) mobile spectrum holder packet one networks (m) sdn bhd (p1).  telekom shares slumped 6% over five days after the march 27 announcement that essentially quashed hopes of more special dividend payments in the near term. in addition, start-up losses from the 57% stake in p1 would eat into earnings as telekom moves into the space where three dominant mobile-phone operators are already finding it tough to grow, observers say.  telekoms group ceo tan sri zamzamzairani mohd isa contests this view. tm will never be no 4 in anything, says a bemused zamzamzairani on the notion of his company playing fourth fiddle to malaysias big three mobile operators: maxis bhd, digi.com bhd and its former unit celcom axiata bhd.  we want to be no 1 in terms of providing converged services  thats very different [from tm playing catch-up with the big three]. people look at us as another mobile player but we are not [adding mobility in isolation]. were a converged player focused on giving the best experience to our customers, he tells the edge.  telekoms decision to add wireless mobility to its traditionally fixed line-centric portfolio may not be that different from a mobile-phone operator like maxis offering its customers a wireline home phone and broadband to sell more services to existing customers. after all, consumers are increasingly accessing the internet using mobile phones and tablets, thanks to high-speed internet on-the-go.providing connectivity alone is not enoughu2026 looking at the changing behaviour of customers, if we only remain in that same space, we will get further and further away from the end-user. thats why we need to move towards enhancing the user experience with content, devices and apps  what we call the innovation exchange, zamzamzairani says, relating telekoms desire to offer an end-to-end suite of services to individuals as well as corporate and enterprise customers.  its about life made easier for our customers, business made easier for our corporate customers. thats not just our tagline but how we must approach the market [to win and retain customers]. technology is no longer a differential because anyone with money can buy technology, which is changing every day.  the lack of a differential in quality of service means that users are likely to choose a service provider that gives the best value and customer experience, industry experts say. this realisation has made it easier for telecoms operators to share network infrastructure  something unheard of in the mid-2000s when network coverage strength was still used as a selling point to woo mobile-phone customers.  similarly, telekom is recouping its rm8.9 billion investment in its hsbb network faster by selling wholesale capacity to rivals. old timers would remember the reluctance displayed by telekom, in its old incarnation, towards equal access, which would allow rivals to piggyback on the local loop to provide the old-school fixed-line phone service.  while the government made telekom promise to open the hsbb network to any local licensed provider when rm2.4 billion worth of public funds went into building phase 1 of the rm11.3 billion hsbb network, some experts think it is telekoms control over this trunk wired fibre network that gives it an edge over the local mobile giants.  it is easier for the fixed-line player to move into mobile, not the other way around, says a telecoms analyst, explaining how wireless network is relatively faster and cheaper to roll out.  zamzamzairani admits as much: because we are strong in [backhaul fixed line] infrastructure, we have greater control over the end-to-end experience. while telekom is open to more acquisitions to improve its service portfolio, he says the company is more likely to make opportunistic purchases rather than actively seeking out targets.  no 1 doesnt mean we have to own everything. we can fill gaps through collaborations like p1 or tie-ups with other players as well, he says, adding that enterprise services and business process outsourcing (bpo) are among areas telekom would like to further strengthen.  for now, the focus is to sort out details of the p1 collaboration, which gives telekom the right to name the latters ceo. with access to p1s 50mhz spectrum in the 2.3ghz and 2.6ghz bands for the 4g-long term evolution (lte) rollout, tm can make greater use of its spectrum in the lower 450mhz and 850mhz bands that have wider coverage capabilities versus the higher capacity to carry data in the higher bands.  what tm needs now is permission to use the 850mhz spectrum nationwide, beyond the universal service provision (usp) coverage [in rural areas], a telecoms analyst says, drawing comfort from the fact that the malaysian government has hitherto chosen not to charge high spectrum fees to encourage wider rollout.  zamzamzairani is convinced that telekom can make a strong case to ask for continued usage of the 850mhz spectrum for nationwide lte rollout when the spectrum is up for renewal next year. this would allow telekom to also offer mobile-phone services, on top of wireless broadband.  the other big-ticket item is the outcome of negotiations on the governments co-investment in phase 2 of the hsbb network rollout announced in budget 2014 last september. zamzamzairani says it is premature to give any guidance on capital expenditure as negotiations are still ongoing but is hopeful of concluding talks by year-end.  instead, he points out the strength of telekoms balance sheet to meet the potential rise in capex needs as well as keep its promise to pay a minimum annual dividend of rm700 million. peak funding was some rm2.7 billion in 2010, when capital needs for hsbb were at their peaku2026 were not a start-up. today our revenues are much strongeru2026 we have said there is no change in our dividend policy and we have many other levers [to pull], zamzamzairani says when pressed for details.  youre right that this [change in direction] is a chance to review [the dividend policy] but i can tell you that this is not being considered, he adds.  time will tell if the scenario will change should telekoms stake in p1 rise substantially.according to the terms of the planned rm210 million convertible bonds issuance by green packet bhd, telekom could end up taking over the latters entire 30% stake in the enlarged p1 if green packet defaults on the debt papers. this would raise tms stake from 57% to 87%, leaving south koreas leading lte operator sk telekom with a 13% stake. as it is, tm is taking up 60% or rm990 million of p1s planned rm1.65 billion convertible bonds to raise cash for network rollout over the next three to five years. for now, standard & poors credit analyst mehul sukkawala says telekoms credit rating is unaffected by its investment in p1 and the lte rollout, which is expected to raise debt-to-ebitda levels to about two times over the next two to three years from 1.7 times in 2013. even then, the ratio is likely to remain significantly below our downgrade rating trigger of close to 2.5 times, the analyst writes in an april 3 note. analysts polled on bloomberg seem split over tms stock performance for the coming 12 months, with eight buys versus 12 holds and 10 sells and price targets ranging from rm4.80 to rm7.22. using its current share base, yield was 3.36% at last thursdays rm5.83 close, based on its minimum rm700 million, or 19.57 sen per share, dividend payout. that could limit upside for the stock, although analysts agree that strategic assets are rarely ever cheap. asked on the naysayers, zamzamzairani said many doubted the hsbbs potential when the idea was mooted in 2008  the reason a minimum dividend was promised to reward investors who stuck on during the lower earnings and high expenditure days. today, hsbb take-up is greater than we thought. who would have thought that after only three-plus years, take-up rate would be 43%?  he, for one, has no doubt that telekom has all the important pieces of the puzzle to regain the dominance it once enjoyed. does this mean it is a matter of time before telekoms stock moves back to malaysias top three position  just like in the early 2000 when the so-called tmt (telekom-maybank-tenaga) stocks were the bluest of the malaysian blue chips?  were not after the top

group bhd, the countrys fixed-line operator telekom malaysia bhd see ms to be back-pedalling by acquiring control of niche fourth-generation (4g) mobile spectrum holder packet one networks (m) sdn bhd (p1).  telekom shares slumped 6% over five days after the march 27 announcement that essentially quashed hopes of more special dividend payments in the near term. in addition, start-up losses from the 57% stake in p1 would eat into earnings as telekom moves into the space where three dominant mobile-phone operators are already finding it tough to grow, observers say.  telekoms group ceo tan sri zamzamzairani mohd isa contests this view. tm will never be no 4 in anything, says a bemused zamzamzairani on the notion of his company playing fourth fiddle to malaysias big three mobile operators: maxis bhd, digi.com bhd and its former unit celcom axiata bhd.  we want to be no 1 in terms of providing converged services  thats very different [from tm playing catch-up with the big three]. people look at us as another mobile player but we are not [adding mobility in isolation]. were a converged player focused on giving the best experience to our customers, he tells the edge.  telekoms decision to add wireless mobility to its traditionally fixed line-centric portfolio may not be that different from a mobile-phone operator like maxis offering its customers a wireline home phone and broadband to sell more services to existing customers. after all, consumers are increasingly accessing the internet using mobile phones and tablets, thanks to high-speed internet on-the-go. providing connectivity alone is not enoughu2026 looking at the changing behaviour of customers, if we only remain in that same space, we will get further and further away from the end-user. thats why we need to move towards enhancing the user experience with content, devices and apps  what we call the innovation exchange, zamzamzairani says, relating telekoms desire to offer an end-to-end suite of services to individuals as well as corporate and enterprise customers.  its about life made easier for our customers, business made easier for our corporate customers. thats not just our tagline but how we must approach the market [to win and retain customers]. technology is no longer a differential because anyone with money can buy technology, which is changing every day.  the lack of a differential in quality of service means that users are likely to choose a service provider that gives the best value and customer experience, industry experts say. this realisation has made it easier for telecoms

global ventures holdings bhd, hong leong financial group bhd, kuala lumpur kepong bhd and ioi properties group bhd caused the index to inch up on some late local buying activity yesterday.  the ringgit firmed against the us dollar on foreign selling of the greenback and gained from 3.2790 to 3.2230 over the last few days. the fbm klci rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the

resistance levels of 1,862, 1,869 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some very heavy selling activity. the index could soon rise towards its short to medium-term upside targets of 1,871 and 1,882 eventually. its simple moving averages (ma) depict an emerging uptrend for its daily, weekly and monthly charts. due to its firmer chart signals, we believe investors will persist with a buy on dips

rm23.3 million had increased significantly by 86.4% from fy12s rm12.5 million. the company said in its results announcement that the strong profitability was mainly due to lower raw material costs from the manufacturing segment and higher sales volume.  a check of bloomberg consensus reveals that only two research houses cover the stock with buy calls. the stock is currently trading at a low historical price-earnings ratio of 11.8 times and is trading below its book value at a price-to-book value of 0.62 times. choo bee has a decent indicative 12-month dividend yield of 2.05%. maybank ib

business segment  providing shipping services for lng, petroleum, chemical and offshore. post misc exiting the container shipping (liner) business in 1h12, mils has become a non-core business for misc. given that the offered price of rm250 million is higher than our valuation of rm68 million, we raise our target price to rm6.32 from rm6.28. however, as miscs share price has overshot our

malacca bhdtarget price: rm7.80 hold ta securities research (march 24): in 3qfy14, united malacca reported a second consecutive recovery in earnings, which were in line with our expectations. on a quarterly basis, earnings were boosted by higher realised crude palm oil (cpo) prices and a lower effective tax rate, although the impact was partially offset by a 7.4% contraction in fresh fruit bunch (ffb) harvest. despite having relatively young estates, ffb yield was negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions. we understand that fy14 ffb harvest is likely to be flat or slightly more on a y-o-y basis. we have assumed lower ffb yield and revised downwards the fy14 production estimate to 2.7% lower y-o-y from 3% growth previously. mature acreage is only projected to increase by 400ha in fy14. in fy15, however, management estimates 1,000ha will reach maturity, coinciding with the rally in the cpo price. we estimate the total planted area will increase by 3% to 22,300ha. key

which the latters son is the major shareholder. we note, however, that liew exercised the third and final tranche of his put option on march 21 and is no longer a shareholder of s p setia. in our view, it may not be easy for syed mokhtar to buy a substantial stake at rm5 per share as he will need to fork out rm3.7 billion just to buy a 30% stake. pnbs high asking price  which is at a 13%

driven by the purchase of seadrills tender rig fleet, which was completed in 1qfy14. net profit expanded strongly by 69.4% y-o-y in fy14, again largely driven by the seadrill rig purchase.  we leave our estimates unchanged for now and expect fy15 to be another year of strong growth with the newfield acquisition kicking in by 1qfy15 and first petrobras contract commencing.  we view that earnings from the ocss segment will normalise as the rm6 billion pan malaysian installation (pmi) contract will commence in fy15. we see some downside risk to earnings if the work order flow is slow in the initial stages of the pmi contract or if new vessels delivered do not commence work immediately. sarawak oil palms bhdtarget price: rm6.90 buy maybank ib research (march 24): investors were pleasantly

the company to deliver 13.5% y-o-y growth in fresh fruit bunch output in 2014 or 1.09 million metric ton (mt)  slightly above the latest guidance of 1.07 million mt.  fund managers were also surprised to learn that sarawak oil palms is diversifying into property development with two maiden project launches planned in 2014. it aims to unlock the value of its 5,000ha taniku estates, strategically located near miri. we are long-term positive on sarawak oil palms as the stock remains undervalued, backed by its 5,000ha of taniku estates and its young trees (4 to 10 years), which comprise 51% of its total planted area. the latter will be a key earnings growth driver in the next three years as the estates enter prime maturity.p.i.e. industrial bhdtarget price: rm9.20 trading buy kenanga

yesterday after the adp national employment report revealed a better set of employment figures for march of 191,000 jobs, lifting the us market on wednesday night.  the s&p 500 index surged to a new high of 1,893.17 but closed up 5.38 points at 1,890.90 points while the dow jones industrial average gained 40.39 points to end at 16,573.00. in malaysia, the fbm klci traded in a narrow range of 16.60 points for the week with higher volume of 1.94 billion to 2.33 billion shares done. the index closed at 1,855.63 yesterday, up 3.63 points from the previous day as blue-chips such as astro malaysia holdings bhd, british american tobacco (m) bhd, petronas gas bhd, public bank bhd and sapurakencana petroleum bhd caused the index to inch up on some late local buying activity yesterday. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the price movements in the index in the next few months following may 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low), 1,882.20 (high), 1,769.80 (low), 1,838.69 (high) and 1,802.88 (low). the indexs daily signals (like cci, dmi, macd, stochastic and oscillator) are all positive. as such, the indexs firm support levels are seen at the 1,802, 1,821 and 1,855 levels, while the resistance areas of 1,858, 1,868 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some very heavy selling activity. the index could soon rise towards its short to medium-term upside targets of 1,871 and 1,882 eventually. its simple moving averages (ma) depict an emerging uptrend for its daily, weekly and monthly charts. due to its firmer chart signals, we believe investors will persist with a buy on weakness policy for the klci. due to the firmer tone for the klci, we are recommending a chart buy on kumpulan fima bhd (kfima). its revenue for the nine months ended dec 31, 2013 of financial year 2014 (9mfy14) improved marginally to rm368.1 million from rm363.9 million. the improvement was attributed to the higher revenue generated by the manufacturing division. despite a slight improvement in revenue, profit before tax in the same period was weaker due to lower profits from the plantation , bulking and food divisions.  according to an announcement by kumpulan fima, the management expects the manufacturing and plantation divisions to remain stable, while the outlook for its bulking and food divisions remains challenging ahead.  a check with bloomberg consensus revealed that only two research houses cover the stock, with both recommending a buy call. the stock is currently trading at a low historical price-earnings ratio (per) of 9.3 times and a fair price-to-book value of 1.03 times. kumpulan fima has a fine and decent indicative 12-month dividend yield of 3.42%. its chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames are very strong. its share price made an obvious surge since its monthly wave-2 low of 33 sen in october 2008. since that 33 sen low, kumpulan fima surged to its recent august 2012 high of rm2.50.  the chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to its recent august 2012 high of rm2.50. as it broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of rm2.19 and rm2.27, look to buy kumpulan fima on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to medium-term uptrends for this stock.  the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd, stochastic and oscillator) are very positive and now depict the obvious indications of kumpulan fimas eventual move towards much higher levels. we expect it to remain very well sought after on dips towards its support levels of rm2.19, rm2.27 and rm2.40.  it may attract minor profit taking activities at the resistance levels of rm2.50, rm2.54 and

underperformed on price concerns (adds detail of financing, greater china focus) singapore (april 1): singapore's oversea-chinese banking corp ltd has made an offer to buy wing hang bank for hk$38.428 billion ($4.95 billion) after reaching a deal with major shareholders including the founding family of the hong kong-based lender. the deal was the outcome of months of negotiations, with the deadline for an agreement extended twice. the acquisition, ocbc's biggest, would give singapore's second-largest bank a much sought-after gateway to the greater china region, where it earned 6 percent of its pre-tax earnings in 2013. the purchase would also help ocbc narrow the gap with domestic rival dbs group holdings, which operates hong kong's fifth-biggest bank. shares of ocbc rose 0.63 percent in early singapore trading on tuesday, following the announcement of the deal. wing hang bank was up 0.16 percent in hong kong. the offer came after ocbc reached a deal with members of wing hang's founding fung family, their affiliates and related family trusts, as well as bny international financing corp, to buy a nearly 45 percent stake in the bank. the singapore lender has also reached separate deals with other shareholders that would increase its stake to 50.66 percent. ocbc is offering hk$125 a share to buy all the stock of wing hang, according to a joint announcement on tuesday. the $4.95 billion offer is lower than expectations, with sources previously estimating the deal could be worth $5.3 billion. wing hang and ocbc had been locked in exclusive negotiations since december after several players, including singapore's united overseas bank, walked away from the deal on price concerns, sources had told reuters earlier. \"it is slightly lower than my original expectation of at least hk$130, but i suppose it's fair from ocbc's standpoint because they don't need revenue or cost synergy for the deal,\" said steven chan, an analyst at maybank kim eng who covers hong kong and chinese banks. \"the return on investment should be roughly equal to the cost of funding if they are going to finance the deal half by debt and half by equity.\" the offer price translates to a book value of 1.77 times for wing hang, according to an ocbc statement. a barclays note said that after adjustment of a 2013 final dividend payment totalling hk$498 million and premises revaluation reserve of hk$2.1 billion, the price-to-book would be 2.02 times. yue xiu group, the trading arm of china's guangzhou city government, paid a multiple of 2.08 times to buy hong kong's chong hing bank last

ratio of one to one, has seen greater trading activity and a substantial decline in its premium to the underlying share, over the past year.  based on its closing price of rm1.26 on jan 13, the warrant is trading at a 7.65% premium to the mother share, as opposed to 20.23% a year ago. based on maybank ib researchs target price of rm3.90 for dialog, in a jan 09 report, the stock theoretically has an upside potential of 14.7%, based on its closing price of rm3.40 on jan 13. assuming zero premium, dialog-wa may rise to rm1.50 apiece (rm3.90-rm2.40), if the mother share meets the research

launching his book titled 21st century economics in the muslim world, musa said the industry would be hampered if it was reserved only for malay muslims. that is one of the biggest problems we have when we talk about religion, he said. you must become muslim first only then you can handle it. then islamic financing and banking will just go down the drain. as it is, now it is open. you should not and cannot insist only malays handle it, he added. he was commenting on a question from the press that non-muslims seem to be more interested in islamic finance and banking compared to malay muslims. musa said this perception was not true, as many banks that are purveyors of islamic finance are headed by successful malay muslims. for example, the head of malayan banking (maybank) is a very successful malay who has won awards. many banks have successful malays working there not because it is islamic finance but because they understand syariah compliance, he added. however, musa said as the industry is relatively new, there are many areas that need to be strengthened and standardised. islamic finance is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the international market. saudi arabia's first english-language newspaper arab news reported yesterday that malaysia and saudi arabia, the worlds two largest islamic financial services markets, has formed ties to help boost growth in both the countries. a report released by the oxford business group (obg), a global publishing and consultancy company producing annual investment and economic reports on more than 30 countries, said that the deal, signed recently, will see the exchanges in kuala lumpur and riyadh share expertise and develop human resources jointly. it covers topics such as equities, mutual funds and sukuk (islamic bonds) and comes after an agreement between malaysias central bank and the uae in october on bolstering economic ties, including in the arena of islamic finance services. according to official statistics, the saudi arabia and malaysia jointly hold us$682 billion (rm2.3 trillion) in islamic banking assets. tadawul, the saudi stock exchange, lists the worlds biggest islamic banks, while bursa malaysia hosts the largest and most liquid market for sukuk. the malaysian market is set to expand this year due to greater international interest. even london has jumped at the opportunity to be a

profitability this financial year, to face turbulence for the rest of the year. this was reflected in the initial panic selling of mas shares last monday, which saw the stock tumble 17% in intra-day trading before recovering at the end of the day.  interestingly, the counter remained steady for the rest of the week, hovering at around 24 sen. however, its trading volume was unusually high last week, averaging 124 million shares daily, suggesting that there were a considerable number of sellers and buyers.  market watchers say institutions, including khazanah nasional bhd, which is mas largest shareholder with a 69.37% stake, may have somewhat muted any heavy impact on the stock.  however, there were also investors who took the opportunity to accumulate mas shares, betting on the airlines recovery from the catastrophe. such optimism is not unfounded. in the past, airlines affected by accidents had recovered in terms of both share price and revenue. singapore airlines, for example, saw its shares drop more than 9% after an incident in october 2000, but it recovered shortly after.  still, negative consumer sentiment may affect mas load factor, at least in the near term. while the airline is already operating at historically high load factors  beating even those of singapore airlines and cathay pacific  the main concern is a further erosion of its passenger yields. the lower yield is the result of the airline discounting its fares to fill up its seats. anticipating lower yields following the mh370 incident, hong leong research, for one, has projected wider losses for the airline in fy2014 ending dec 31  by at least rm50 million from its original forecast. it sees mas posting a net loss of rm942 million in fy2014 compared with an earlier forecast of rm892 million. mas reported a rm1.17 billion loss in fy2013. analysts say besides lowering fares, mas will need to work extra hard to regain flyers confidence in the airline. these efforts could include splurging on marketing campaigns. hence, we expect tougher challenges ahead for mas to turn around, says hong leong research in a note.  given that flight mh370 was carrying mostly chinese passengers, the question arises as to whether mas will lose a significant share of the china market. no, say analysts, including mohshin aziz of maybank investment bank. the market is huge in that sector and i believe with competitive fares, mas will not lose the [china] market, comments mohshin. although mas did not detail the contribution from the china market in its latest annual report, it has in the past singled out the country as one of its core growth markets. meanwhile, mas may need to compensate the next of kin of flight mh370 passengers. it is too early to estimate how much compensation mas may need to pay but judging from historical accounts, the financial impact on the airline is not expected to be significant relative to its revenue. mas will need to work hard to regain flyers confidence in the airline for instance, in the case of air france flight 447, which crashed in 2009, killing 228, an advance compensation of u20ac17,600 was paid for each passenger, bringing the total to u20ac4 million. the airline also granted u20ac100,000 (for a total of u20ac22.8 million) in compensation through insurance as a compassionate gesture. the air france flight crashed into the atlantic ocean, off the coast of brazil, in 2009 but its main wreckage and black box were only found two years later.  in mas case, it has reportedly provided a total of rmb31,000 (rm16,577) in initial financial assistance to each of the affected families. while it is expected to pay out more, the impact of such one-off compensation is expected to be minimal, given that most of it would be covered by insurance. the current crisis is unprecedented for mas, which registered negative net operating cash flow of rm854.79 million in fy2013 compared with rm305.04 million in fy2012. further deterioration in its operating condition could eat into its rm3.75 billion cash pile as at dec 31, 2013, fast. the cash was mostly from a rights issue that raised rm3 billion in the middle of 2013. mas, which is undergoing a fleet replacement programme, needs about rm1 billion a year to stay afloat.  the tangible impact aside, the missing flight mh370 has left an indelible mark on mas stellar record in the industry. given the severity of the incident, hong leong research does not discount the possibility of changes in mas top management. this is the second incident under the current management after the crash of mas wing in kudat, sabah, in october 2013 that saw three deaths, it says in a note. maybank ibs mohshin says the current crisis could be a reason to revisit plans to privatise the national carrier. if there is any inclination to privatise mas, this incident is all the more reason to do so and fix the airline, he says. this article first appeared in the edge

malaysian airline system bhd, which had targeted to return to profitability this financial year, to face turbulence for the rest of the year. this was reflected in the initial panic selling of mas shares last monday, which saw the stock tumble 17% in intra-day trading before recovering at the end of the day.  interestingly, the counter remained steady for the rest of the week, hovering at around 24 sen. however, its trading volume was unusually high last week, averaging 124 million shares daily, suggesting that there were a considerable number of sellers and buyers.  market watchers say institutions, including khazanah nasional bhd, which is mas largest shareholder with a 69.37% stake, may have somewhat muted any heavy impact on the stock.  however, there were also investors who took the opportunity to accumulate mas shares, betting on the airlines recovery from the catastrophe. such optimism is not unfounded. in the past, airlines affected by accidents had recovered in terms of both share price and revenue. singapore airlines, for example, saw its shares drop more than 9% after an incident in october 2000, but it recovered shortly after.  still, negative consumer sentiment may affect mas load factor, at least in the near term. while the airline is already operating at historically high load factors  beating even those of singapore airlines and cathay pacific  the main concern is a further erosion of its passenger yields. the lower yield is the result of the airline discounting its fares to fill up its seats. anticipating lower yields following the mh370 incident, hong leong research, for one, has projected wider losses for the airline in fy2014 ending dec 31  by at least rm50 million from its original forecast. it sees mas posting a net loss of rm942 million in fy2014 compared with an earlier forecast of rm892 million. mas reported a rm1.17 billion loss in fy2013. analysts say besides lowering fares, mas will need to work extra hard to regain flyers confidence in the airline. these efforts could include splurging on marketing campaigns. hence, we expect tougher challenges ahead for mas to turn around, says hong leong research in a note.

(dec 30): we believe that iois shareholders should take up the restricted offer for sale of shares in ioi properties group bhd (ioip). the offer price of rm1.76/share values ioip, at an estimated fy14f pe of 8.8 times, assuming a conservative net profit of rm644.9 million. ioip is expected to be a proxy to the property sector, after its listing on jan 15. with a market capitalisation of rm8.1 billion (based on the reference price of rm2.51/share), ioip would emerge as the second largest property company in malaysia, after uem sunrise bhd. the total gross development value of ioips property projects is envisaged at over rm20 billion. ioips attractiveness lies in its high operating margin, supported by low land cost. ioips operating margin is expected to range from 40% to 50%, in the next two years.  currently, about 10% of ioips gross profits are from property investment. with the rising number of investment properties, roughly 40% of ioips earnings could come from rental income, in the future. bumi armada bhdtarget price: rm4.70 buy affin research (dec 30): bumi armada ended 2013 on a strong note. the group announced three major contract wins in december, amounting to us$1.7 billion (rm5.7 billion). the flurry of new contract wins, boosted bumi armadas firm contract backlog to rm13.7 billion and extension options to rm9 billion. moving into 2014, we remain positive on the groups floating production storage and offloading (fpso) business outlook. bumi armada is the clear frontrunner for the madura fpso contract, valued at us$1.2 billion for a fixed 10-year term, with an option to extend for a further five years. bumi armadas other key business divisions  the osv (offshore support vessels) and t&i (transport & installation)  are also doing well. the osv charter rates are firm, and its fleet utilisation rate has been, and is expected to remain, around 85%. bumi armada is our top pick, among malaysia o&g big caps. the sizeable contract wins in december, coupled with a positive business outlook will, in our view, re-rate the stock this year. nextnation communication bhdtarget price: 7 sen sell ta securities (dec 27): nextnation communication bhd (nncb)s 1hfy14 core net profit of rm2.7 million, was within expectations, accounting for 60% of our full-year estimates.  correspondingly, 1hfy14 revenue surged 52% y-o-y, due to the strong sequential rebound in topline. however, topline growth did not flow through to the bottom line, due to higher depreciation that caused pre-tax margins to contract to 6%. we await further developments on nncbs new ventures, but are not perturbed by delays in these projects, as they will enable it to accumulate cash from existing core it operations, to beef up its balance sheet. we expect 2hfy14 to be weaker, due to upfront costs required for its start-up projects, such as its coal trading venture in indonesia and data centre management. the successful execution of nncbs new property project at cyberjaya, will be a near-term re-rating catalyst. it expects a gross development profits of about rm70 million, from the mixed development. spread over the projects tenure of 11 years, this implies a potential gross profit of rm6.4 million pa. axis real estate investment trusttarget price: rm3.13 outperform kenanga research (dec 27): axis reit announced the proposed disposal of axis plaza for a total cash consideration of rm34 million, which is at a slight premium to the appraised value of rm32 million.  the disposal is to realise the value of the asset, as it has fully-matured. unitholders can look forward to net gains on disposal of rm11 million or 2.35 sen/share, which will be fully-distributed back to shareholders.  there could be a possibility of other disposals, as axis reit has a total of rm225 million in revaluation gains, across all its assets, and we believe, asset acquisitions in fy14 may be tough, due to the low capitalisation rate environment. we have increased fy14 rni (realised net income) and dividend per unit (dpu) by 11% each, to rm104.8 million and 22.8 sen respectively, to take into account the exercise. our target price has been lowered slightly to rm3.13, despite the higher dpu from the disposal.  nonetheless, the gain on disposal increases its fy14e gross dpu significantly, and offers investors a decent fy14e gross yield of 7.8%. gamuda bhdtarget price: rm4.80 neutral public invest research (dec 31): the groups latest offer to acquire the stake in kesas holdings, has been accepted by all parties, with the exception of perbadanan kemajuan negeri selangor (pkns), leaving gamuda with 70% upon completion of the deal. the latest deal effectively valued the highway concession at rm1.4 billion. we understand that the sustainable toll receipts estimated for kesas, is rm120 million pa, or around 11.7 times per of the latest offer. the toll concession is expiring in 2023. kesas is contributing about rm30 million to rm40 million net income to the group, in our estimates, and the deal could increase the recurring earnings, in view of the proposed move to dispose its water assets.  with the deal closed, gamudas purchase to increase its stake to 70% in kesas, is expected to increase its net gearing from the current 20% to 31%, which is manageable, in our view. in view of the anticipated infrastructure spending, job flows for gamuda remain good, but we think that the risk reward is not compelling, for now. malaysian airline system bhdtarget price: 30 sen neutral rhb research institute (dec 31): mas overall november load factor grew, rising 1.6% ppt y-o-y to 76.4%, mainly due to the passenger segment, mitigating the drop in loads from its cargo and freighter segment.  load factors for the domestic and international segments came in at 84.7% and 79.5% respectively, despite the sharp increase in passenger capacity, as overall revenue passenger kilometre climbed 27.5% y-o-y. while mas has succeeded in driving loads to record highs in recent months, this was accompanied by a sharp deterioration in yields. what is worrying is that the significant growth in passengers handled, did not result in economies of scale, as unit costs barely budged. we think that mas is still trying to find its footing, following its entry into the oneworld alliance, with more efforts focusing on costs, only in 2014. the fourth quarter is traditionally the strongest one for mas, due to the seasonally stronger traffic spurred by the holiday season. however, as we highlighted earlier, we remain doubtful about its cost-cutting efforts, at least in 2013. perisai petroleum teknologi bhdtarget price: rm1.87 buy ta securities (jan 2): perisai has ordered a third jack-up drilling rig from sembcorp marine, for us$211.5 million. we are positive on this acquisition, which is consistent with the groups strategy to acquire a new asset each year.  thus far, the group has added one new asset every year, from 2012 to 2015. furthermore, perisai is able to benefit from economies of scale, given its expanding stable of three jack-up drilling rigs. we believe that perisais third rig will easily secure a new contract, given high demand for local rigs, to substitute foreign rigs in malaysia.  we estimate that the third rig may contribute rm34 million and rm69 million to perisais fy16 and fy17 bottom line, respectively. its fy12 to fy15 earnings growth trajectory remains intact, despite gaps arising from project transitions for e3 and mopu rubicone.  on top of that, the talisman-perisai joint venture is a frontrunner for a psc contract at block pm9. we anticipate that mopu rubicone will be utilised for this field, if perisai manages to secure this project. cypark resources bhdtarget price: rm2.78 add cimb research (jan 2): despite the disappointing results, cypark remains an add, as we remain positive on its longer term outlook, underpinned by more renewable energy (re) capacity, coming up. we expect further increases in re capacity, to act as a catalyst for the stock. fy10/13 revenue grew 10.9% y-o-y to rm217.1 million, thanks to higher revenue from environmental engineering and re services. the environmental engineering divisions revenue grew, driven by the various re-related projects that it undertook during the year. the fourfold growth in its re revenue was mainly due to the increase in its export capacity of green electricity, to tenaga. we expect the re revenue growth momentum to persist in fy14, as cypark continues to expand its re capacity. cypark expects to secure additional re quota in the future, as the government aims to increase the generation capacity to between 5% and 6% of total generation capacity, by 2015, from 2% currently. this augurs well for cypark, as it is one of the largest re players here. kim loong resources bhdtarget price: rm2.62 neutral alliance research (jan 2): kim loong reported 3qfy14 and 9mfy14 net profit of rm15.7 million and rm41.2 million, respectively. results are expected to improve further in 4qfy14, as crude palm oil prices have trended higher q-o-q. its 9mfy14 net profit improved mildly by 3.3% y-o-y, as the uptick in production helped to offset lower cpo prices, during the period. there was also a recovery in profit from the milling segment in 3qfy14, which boosted net profit. going into 2014, we expect cpo prices to trend higher than in 2013, as market fundamentals are favourable. the upcoming production down cycle will keep cpo prices buoyant in 1q14, while biodiesel demand will keep inventories well-managed throughout the year, helping to offset export weakness. our target price for kim loong is raised to rm2.62, from rm2.22 previously. this implies a target per of 13 times, pegged to fy15 eps. kim loong currently does not have major tracts of new maturities, that can drive organic growth. we view the stock as fully-valued at current levels. cahya mata sarawak bhdtarget price: rm7.70 buy maybank ib research (jan 2): cms has confirmed its integrated phosphate plant joint venture (mpa jv), that is expected to contribute maiden earnings to cms, in 2016.  this year, cms could surprise positively, with more strategic investments, higher dividend payouts and corporate exercises. our new target price translates into 10.7 times fy14 per, which is still undemanding.  samalaju industries sdn bhd (cms wholly-owned subsidiary), malaysian phosphate ventures sdn bhd and arif enigma sdn bhd, have formed a 40:40:20 jv to develop southeast asias first integrated phosphate plant in samalaju industrial park, in bintulu, sarawak. with the ppa term sheet finalised with syarikat sesco, the jv will enjoy competitively-priced, long-term power supply in sarawak. the jv will enhance cms recurring earnings base and further fortify its long-term earnings growth.  we forecast rm25 million pbt from the property division in fy13 to fy15, and cms has locked in a net gain of rm21 million, from the land sale to mpa jv for fy14. kimlun corp bhdfair value: rm2.52 buy amresearch (jan 2): on dec 31, kimlun announced to bursa malaysia that it has accepted a letter of award from country view resources sdn bhd  a wholly-owned subsidiary of country view bhd  to construct apartments in johor. the construction work is expected to be completed by december 2015. the new award brought kimluns new job wins in 2013, to a record rm1.2 billion. we expect the new job wins to only contribute strongly, from fy14f onwards, as 70% of these were only secured in 2hfy13. we have a new order book assumption of rm900 million, rm1 billion and rm900 million, for fy14f to fy16f respectively. potential jobs in the near term, include the tunnel lining segment package for the thomson mrt line, while kimlun will benefit from kvmrt2 jobs in the mid- to long term. kimlun will also benefit from further construction activities in iskandar malaysia. amid headwinds in the construction sector, we continue to like kimlun as a proxy for construction activities within johor, as well as mrt jobs in the klang valley and singapore. mkh bhdtarget price: rm5.40 buy hwangdbs vickers research (jan 2): mkh is a niche township developer in kajang, with an uninterrupted 25-year profit track record. its venture into palm oil cultivation in indonesia since 2008, has started to bear fruit, driving up core profit by 96% in fy13. we project 31% three-year earnings cagr, driven by property and plantation. valuation is compelling at five times fy15f per, despite being at the inflection point of a multi-year re-rating. mkh is poised to benefit from an uptrend in cpo prices. despite a young age profile  around four years  for its 14,400ha of palm oil estates in east kalimantan, the segment booked rm29 million ebit in fy13.  we expect plantation contribution to increase to 29% and 39% of group earnings, in fy14 and fy15 respectively. it is the cheapest plantation proxy, at five times earnings. mkhs property sales are unlikely to be affected by the recent cooling measures, because its properties are targeted at the mass market. it has rm503 million unbilled sales, and will launch rm890 million worth of new projects in fy14. this story first appeared in the edge weekly edition of jan 6-12, 2014."}, "523": {"date_posted": "6/3/2014", "title": "#company analysis* is it time to

we believe that btotos niche as the only nfo offering lotto games, puts it in a position of strength, compared with other nfos, whose traditional 4d games are facing competition from illegal operators. the companys move to call off its listing, may have been a blessing in disguise, as the proposal would have eventually diluted btotos interest in the nfo, to 28.7% (from 100%), which would

concession to enhance ijms valuations by rm100 million, or 7.8 sen per share, assuming 10% project internal rate of return. ijm hopes to win 70% of the rm5 billion wce work packages, translating into rm3.5 billion. this would significantly boost its outstanding order book, which stood at rm2.5 billion as at end-september 2013, after winning rm538 million, year-to-date. gamuda bhdtarget price: rm5.25 outperform kenanga research (dec 24): just a few days after the deadline for the remaining kesas shareholders acceptance (of which only amcorp properties bhd accepted), gamuda has made fresh offers to the kesas shareholders, that had rejected the earlier offer, namely permodalan nasional bhd (pnb, 20% stake) and perbadanan kemajuan negeri selangor (pkns, 30% stake). gamuda increased the offer price by 12% to rm280 million and rm420 million, for pnb and pkns respectively. gamuda is also increasing amcorps offer value to rm280 million. altogether, gamudas offer price for the 70% stake in kesas, is rm980 million (rm1.4 billion for 100% stake). we are of the view that the 12% increase in the offer price, is still fair, judging from the valuation of normalised per of 12 times (average net profit of rm120 million) against its peer, litrak holdings 17 times. it is also still below our valuation for kesas holdings, at rm1.63 billion. we believe that gamudas strong fundamentals have yet to be fully-priced in its share price.  malaysian resources corp bhdtarget price: rm2.06 buy hlib research (dec 24): mrcb has entered into an agreement with arch angel dmc sdn bhd (aadmc), to acquire a 70% stake in arch angel capital sdn bhd (aac) for rm34 million. the offer price consists of: 1) rm2.5 million for shares in aac from aadmc; 2) rm1.5 million for new shares in aac; and 3) rm30 million for redeemable convertible preference shares in aac. aac has entered into a sale and purchase agreement with putrajaya holdings, for a 1.84-acre freehold parcel, known as plot 2c4, precinct 2, putrajaya. the acquisition has yet to be completed. we understand that the proposed development is for a 13-storey commercial building, with a potential gdv of rm300 million to rm400 million. we are positive on the move to diversify from kl sentral, for development profits. however, the deal will only be meaningful, if the development can be monetised quickly. based on 3qfy13 numbers, mrcb has a cash pile of rm473.8 million, and total debt/sukuk of rm3.4 billion. hence, this acquisition has minimal impact on its balance sheet.datasonic group bhdfair value: rm2.58 buy rhb research (dec 23): datasonics share price went ex on dec 23, 2013, following the completion of its 1-to-5 share split. with that, we foresee improvements in its trading liquidity. we believe fy13 earnings could surpass our rm80.8 million full-year estimate, with dividend surprise, likely on the cards. maintain buy with our fair value increased to rm2.58 (from rm2.36), as we ascribe a higher forecast fy14 target per of 18 times. datasonics daily traded volume averaged at 500,000 shares over the last two months, compared with 200,000, prior to our initiation. the completion of the share split exercise will boost its outstanding share base to 675 million (from 135 million).  this, in our view, could entice participation from retail investors and improve trading liquidity, over the near-to-medium term. we believe that its fy13 earnings, due to be released by mid-february 2014 (at the time of writing), could potentially surpass our full-year estimate of rm80.8 million. we gather that improvements in overall profitability, are likely on higher economies of scale, given that both its mykad and passport contracts have gained further traction in 4q13.tenaga nasional bhdtarget price: rm12.29 add cimb research (dec 23): we have gathered that: 1) future tariff reviews after six months, remain very much the governments prerogative; 2) piped gas prices from petronas could be raised again, assuming there is another round of tariff hike, after six months; and 3) tenagas return on assets (roa) is expected to match its weighted average cost of capital (wacc) by 2017.  the clarification with regards to the tariff hike provides investors with more comfort for tenagas outlook, moving forward. the base tariff hike would improve tenagas roa, to match its wacc by 2017, thus implying that it would drive earnings higher, to a certain extent. although fuel costs remain a concern, we believe that they would not leave tenaga worse off, in the longer run. our target price is unchanged at rm12.29, based on 12.6 times fy15 eps, in line with its historical five-year average per. we maintain our add rating. rerating catalysts include improved earnings for fy14 to fy17, arising from the base tariff hike that is expected to increase tenagas roa. mkh bhdfair value: rm3.05 trading buy kenanga research (dec 26): mkh is a fundamentally strong property developer with a solid 19-year track record of profitability since its listing in 1995.we gather that most of mkhs housing projects are located in kajang and they mainly offer affordable units priced below rm600,000 per unit. this should place mkh in a good position as we believe developers with significant exposure to affordable housing should fare better under the current economic scenario. mkhs fy13 core net profit surged 60% y-o-y to rm123 million. this was mainly due to the strong performance from its property development and construction division in which pbt jumped 69% y-o-y to rm143 million. the plantation divisions core pbt also increased to rm24 million (from last years rm5 million). we have excluded the impact of unrealised forex loss and a gain on asset disposal (rm31 million) in the plantation division. our fair value of rm3.05 is based on a 35% discount to our sop rnav of rm4.69, implying 1.02 times price-to-book value on fy14e book value per share of rm3 or 7.1 times fy14e per.bumi armada bhdtarget price: rm4.43 trading buy alliance research (dec 24): bumi armada has formalised its contract with enquest, to supply the kraken floating production, storage and offloading (fpso) vessel. the contract is worth rm4.6 billion and covers the bareboat charter, as well as the operation and maintenance of the fpso vessel, for a fixed period of eight years, with 17 yearly optional extensions. the contract value is within our estimates.  fy14 is looking to be a good year for bumi armada, with a potential for more news flow on another fpso contract in indonesia. we maintain our trading buy recommendation, given that the long-awaited fpso contracts are finally starting to materialise. there could be some upside from fy16 onwards, from the commencement of operational and maintenance (o&m) works. however, values tend to vary for o&m works, as they depend on the work volume, which may be minimal in the early years of an fpso vessels operations. based on our observation of other fpso contracts, o&m work can sometimes not be profitable. we make no changes to our estimates, at this juncture.tambun indah land bhdfair value: rm2.08 buy rhb research (dec 26): tambun indah has entered into an agreement with gems maju sdn bhd, to construct a campus on an eight-acre site, and thereafter, lease it to the latter for 30 years. while the construction of phase 1, will cost tambun indah rm38 million, gems maju will invest another rm32 million for the campus fittings. phase 1 will have a built-up area of 200,000 sq ft, and according to the management, the rental for the first eight years is fixed at 8% of the construction costs, plus 4% of the land value.  from the ninth year onwards, there will be a step up of 2% annually. this translates into about rm3.5 million per annum, or an attractive 7% yield, based on the net market value of rm35 psf, after a rm5 psf discount for the land. we make no changes to our forecast. we continue to hold our positive view on the penang mainland, as more investments are expected to flow in, in 2014, with tambun indah as the key beneficiary. this story first appeared in the edge weekly edition of dec 30,

international monetary funds warning of risks to global growth as well as the us federal reserves minutes on further potential tapering of quantitative easing led to a weaker american market tone wednesday night. the sp500 index inched down 12.01 points to close at 1,828.75 points while the dow jones industrial average fell 89.84 points to end at 16,040.56. the fbm klci traded in a narrow range of 13.7 points for the week, with volumes of 2.86 billion to 3.63 billion done. the index closed at 1,827.81 yesterday, down 1.64 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks such as hong leong financial group bhd, ioi corp bhd klk berhad, petronas gas bhd and tenaga nasional bhd caused the index to decline marginally yesterday. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since may

signals (cci, dmi, macd, oscillator and stochastic) are all positive. as such, the indexs obvious support levels are seen at 1,769, 1,799 and 1,827 points, while the resistance areas of 1,833, 1,839 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some very heavy profit taking. our rebound retracement target of 1,839.26 (62% level) may cap the index in the short- to medium-term. the index must penetrate this key level with high volume to be certain of an eventual test of the 1,882.20 high again. its simple moving averages (ma) depict a triple timeframe for its daily, weekly and monthly chart. due to

of the klci, we recommend a chart buy on muda holdings bhd. muda made a 52-week high on wednesday at rm1.73 backed by high volumes suggesting strong investor optimism for its upcoming fourth quarter financial year 2013 (4qfy13) results. since our first buy recommendation on jan 22 this year, the stock has risen more than 30%.  a check on bloomberg consensus indicates that no research house has coverage on the stock. the stock is currently trading at a historical price-earnings ratio of 13 times and a low price-to-book value of 0.64 times. muda announced its 3qfy13 results in november last year which saw a very strong profit after tax growth of 170.5% to rm31.8 million due to a one-off disposal of kl resources pte ltd.  mudas chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly timeframes are very strong indeed. its share price made an obvious surge since its weekly wave-2 low of 74 sen in september 2013. since that 74 sen low, muda has risen to its recent february 2014 high of rm1.73.  its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to its recent february 2014 high of rm1.73. as it broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of rm1.30 and rm1.36, look to buy muda on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to medium-term uptrends for this stock. the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (such as the cci, dmi, oscillator and macd) are very strong and now depict the obvious indications of mudas eventual rise towards much higher levels. we expect muda to remain very firm towards its support levels of rm1.30, rm1.36 and rm1.63. it will attract minor profit taking at the resistance levels of rm1.73, rm1.85 and rm2.03. its upside targets are now located at rm2.08, rm2.48 and rm2.83. lee cheng hooi is the

{"date_posted": "19/2/2014", "title": "the edge best call awards 2013", "article": " in its ninth edition, the edges annual best call awards received submissions from 15 research outfits in 2013. winners were selected from the 95 recommendations, submitted for consideration. number crunchers would know that some houses submitted more than six calls.  each submission is already a winner in the eyes of its respective head of research, who were each invited to submit five best calls, plus an additional nomination for best discovery. we cannot feature all of them here, due to the lack of space. we chose to acknowledge two winners from year 2012, as they continued to be right in 2013 and the relative quantum of stock gains, warranted the acknowledgement. for our part, the edge best call awards is meant to recognise good fundamental analysis, in the hope of spurring continued excellence and the unearthing of new gems. it is not meant to be a measure of performance or a determinant of ones bonus, and it is certainly not meant to be a glory box.  humility is one trait that winners should never forget. and like any true gem, their worth will ultimately be acknowledged, given time.  here are year 2013s winners, in no particular order. congratulations again to the winners. to the gems who did not make the cut in year 2013, keep up the good work and all the best for year 2014. rhb research institute analyst kong heng siong and public investment bank research analyst chong hoe leongs call on prestariang bhd in year 2012, kong heng siong was acknowledged for showing investors an entry price into prestariang bhd, that was 44% lower than its 90 sen initial public offering (ipo) price. in fact, when he said that it was time to buy on sept 29, 2011, prestariang was near its all-time low of 49 sen. highlighting its 50% payout policy, he said that dividend yields were at least 10%. the stock rocketed 172%, within 10 months. on jan 8, 2013, when prices were at rm1.16, kong told clients that prestariang should be worth a buck more. those who followed, would have more-than-doubled their money, as the stock gained as much as 152% to rm2.85 apiece, on dec 13. at the time of writing, there was still another 18% upside potential to his rm3.37 price target, with 4.2% potential yield, going by his fy2014 dividend forecast of 12 sen apiece. we anticipate a slew of oil and gas contracts, to catalyse a re-rating of its shares, he wrote of the company that provides it-related training and certification.  kongs price target is the highest among three analysts tracking the stock, bloomberg data shows. the most conservative is public investment bank researchs chong hoe leong, who receives special mention, because those that bought prestariang when he initiated coverage with a buy in mid-august 2012, would have seen gains of as much as 149% at its peak. chong has since cut prestariang to neutral, with a price target at rm2.47. only time will tell as to who will be proved right. maybank investment bank research analyst ong chee tings call on genting plantations bhd plantation stocks saw lacklustre trading for most of 2013, as high crude palm oil inventory levels weighed on prices. ong chee ting, however, breathed new life into genting plantations bhd, by recasting the stock as an iskandar development play. in a march 6, 2013 note, he told clients that genting plantations rm6.4 billion market capitalisation, has merely priced in its growing palm oil assets. what investors overlooked is genting plantations some 6,600 acres of prime landbank, worth rm4 billion, in iskandar and sepang, he said, telling clients that at rm8.50 levels, they were getting the iskandar landbank for free.  raising his recommendation to a buy and price target from rm8 to rm10.30, he said that there was already a 20% discount to the rm13 apiece that he had calculated the assets to be worth.  genting plantations rose as much as 33.6% to rm11.53 apiece on nov 18, 2013, gaining as much as rm2.2 billion in market cap, before the latest round of property cooling measures doused investor confidence.  at the time of writing, genting plantations market cap was at rm8.3 billion, with its share price closing at rm10.94 on dec 16, 2013. when ong cut his call to hold on nov 19, with a rm10.10 target price, the stock was going for rm11.20 apiece. now, he has a rm10.90 target price, just above consensus valuations that range from rm9.40 to rm14.05 apiece.ta research analyst mohlini narayanans call on scientex bhd some good things in life do come free. it would seem that mohlini narayanans recommendation on scientex bhd, is one such instance, at least for the most of 2013. covering the stock for ta research under the capital market development fund-bursa research scheme  aimed at raising the profile of small and mid-sized companies, while encouraging informed investment decisions among retail investors  those who paid attention when mohlini said that there was some 20.8% upside potential to the stock, stood to double their investments as the stock climbed 98% from rm2.93 on dec 20, 2012, to as high as rm5.78, on nov 4, 2013. will she continue to be right, going into 2014? on nov 12, 2013, she upgraded her recommendation to a buy. her target price was raised from rm5.97 to rm6.47 apiece, even as she lifted the price-earnings ratio (per) to 10 times, from 8 times, after taking into consideration daibochi plastic and packaging industry bhds 16.2 times, and tomypak holdings bhds 10 times per.  the upgrade also came as scientex proposed to buy food packaging-maker, seacera polyfilms sdn bhd, for rm40 million  a deal she expects to only lift fy2014 earnings by 1.1%, but could raise gearing to 0.31 times. her price target is the most bullish among four analysts polled on bloomberg, all of whom were calling a buy. hwangdbs vickers research analysts kevin wong and chong tjen-san on muhibbah engineering (m) bhd muhibbah engineering (m) bhd was first featured in the edge best call awards in 2006, as the years best discovery, by asia analytica sdn bhds kevin khoo, who was the first to issue an extensive report in september 2005. muhibbah, which started 2006 near 20 sen levels, reached rm3.50 levels by july 2007. by october 2008, however, the stock had fallen to 60 sen levels and largely hovered around the rm1 levels, until early 2013. on march 27, 2013, hwangdbs analysts kevin wong and chong tjen-san, reintroduced the niche marine, and oil and gas contractor  which also makes cranes and ships, as well as takes on civil engineering jobs  to investors.  with an increasingly-crowded civil infrastructure space, we think that this spread of business differentiates muhibbah from the average contractor, they said, when initiating coverage with a rm2.15 target price. at the time, the company  which stood to benefit from a new wave of petronas offshore service vessel contracts  was also among those shortlisted for myanmars mandalay international airport concession. from rm1.18 apiece, muhibbah jumped 130% to reach rm2.72, on july 27, 2013. even at rm2.33 on dec 16, 2013, the stock has appreciated 97%, since coverage was initiated. although this is smaller than its 182% gain year-to-date, it is still a great comeback story. now, the analysts value muhibbah at rm3.10 apiece. will they continue to be right?bimb research analyst law mei chis call on tambun indah land bhd to be sure, bimbs law mei chi wasnt the earliest to discover tambun indah land bhd  a niche property developer that saw its share price jump in year 2013, as investors began looking for value in the small and mid-cap space. she was also not the most bullish, among analysts polled on bloomberg. however, hers was the best among submissions received for consideration, when it came to recommendations in the alternative real estate developer space. investors who paid attention when law said butterworth-based tambun indah should be worth as much as 34% more, based on what its assets and landbank were worth, stood to benefit as the stock rose 70%, from 89 sen on april 2, 2013, to as high as rm1.51 on aug 19. she had a price target of rm1.70 at the time of writing, implying just over 20% upside, for the company that she reckons will see spillover benefits from the investments going into penang, and improved accessibility via the penang second link. bimb securities research analyst chiong tong chai and hong leong investment bank analyst low yee huaps calls on uzma bhd uzma bhd may not be a big name among oil and gas counters, but with its stock up over 200% in year 2013, it is one of those counters that with hindsight, many would kick themselves for not buying. part of the gains was spurred by investors gravitation towards the esoteric oil and gas business in 2013. it is due to the quantum of the gains that bimb securities researchs chiong tong chai and hong leong investment banks (hlib) low yee huap, both merit notable mentions. bimb, which started covering uzma in 2011, has the stock as its top pick in year 2013.  hlib too, began covering the company, ahead of its rally in 2013. as the edge best call awards usually go to new calls made during the year, both recommendations would not normally have made the list, as they are not entirely new. the decision to make an exception, took into consideration that some calls will take time to be proved right, and investors who took action should be laughing all the way to the bank. petroliam nasional bhds strategy to enhance oil recovery on existing and new oilfields augurs well for uzma, which is also eyeing risk-sharing contracts (rsc) for marginal oilfield developments.  chiong is now neutral on uzma, with a rm5.05 price target, but foresees the successful bagging of an rsc, bringing the company better fortunes. low, on the other hand, still has a buy call and rm5.20 target price. time will tell, who has the better call. cimb research analyst norziana mohd inon and kaf-seagroatt & campbell securities analyst dharmini thuraisingams calls on alam maritim resources bhd alam maritim resources bhd is not done yet, with its splashy comeback this year  thats what cimb researchs norziana mohd inon told clients in march 2013, after the stock leapt from 50 sen in october 2012, to around 85 sen. from there, the stock nearly doubled, in less than four months, to as high as rm1.67 in july 2013. it was still up 122% at its rm1.52 close, on dec 16, 2013. norziana, who started coverage on alam maritim in march 2008, continues to be bullish on the company, due to its ballooning order book and the anticipation of improvements in utilisation and charter rates, amid a significant pick-up in offshore drilling activities. her target price was rm1.90, at the time of writing. another long-time believer of alam maritim is kaf-seagroatt & campbell securities dharmini thuraisingam, who also saw the recovery on charter rates for offshore vessels. in january 2013, she told clients that the earlier spike in share price was just the beginning of a larger structural re-rating of the stock. she has a target price of rm1.80. due to the strong gains seen at alam maritim in 2013, both analysts earn notable mentions for their continued conviction that proved propitious for clients, although their calls have been maintained for years. cimb research analyst nigel foos call on my eg services bhd if my eg services bhds shares ran harder in 2012, cimb researchs nigel foo might have earned the best discovery award in 2012. the delayed response by the market notwithstanding, investors who picked up my eg shares at 73 sen levels, when foo started coverage with a buy on aug 6, 2012, would have more-than-tripled their investments in just 16 months. my egs lowest point in 2013, was 74 sen on feb 6, during which, foo told clients that the shares were worth rm1.34 apiece. those who bought back the shares would have been sitting on 260% of gains, as they touched rm2.67 apiece on nov 27. total returns were still 249%, if measured between the initiation on aug 6, 2012, and dec 16s rm2.54 close. in his initiation note, foo said that my eg could even thrive in recessions, as consumers are encouraged to use its cheaper and more convenient services. it also enjoys some recurring income, he said in a note, on sept 19, 2013, which highlighted potential income stream from the custom service tax monitoring system and road safety diagnostic services, that had not been pencilled into its forecasts. foo has since cut my eg to hold on dec 12, 2013, with there being only 6.1% upside potential to his rm2.78 target price, from its rm2.62 close that day. thats conservative relative to macquarie research, which became the second house to start coverage on my eg, on aug 15, 2013. the latter still says buy, with a rm3 target price. amresearch analyst thomas soons call on kkb engineering bhd when amresearchs thomas soon initiated coverage on kkb engineering bhd with a buy on sept 3, 2012, the stock was hovering near a two-year low of rm1.45. the counter hardly moved, but eight months later, soon saw reason to raise his price target, from rm1.80 to rm1.91 apiece, on april 19, 2013. citing information from kkbs 2012 annual report, soon flagged kkb chairman datuk kho kak bengs statement, that the group stands ready to expand further into fabrication, for the oil and gas sector, in the near future, having more-than-tripled its yard capacity, to 50,000 tonnes in 2012.  its prospects have also brightened considerably, since its 43%-owned associate oceanmight sdn bhd secured a three-year petronas approved supplier licence, which allows it to tender for offshore facility fabrication jobs. among the jobs that it has since bagged, include a rm17.1 million fabrication job for petronas proposed lng train 9 project in bintulu, sarawak. incidentally, kkb was also hovering at rm1.45 levels, on april 19, 2013. investors who bought on soons cue, would have seen 96% gains in about six months, as the stock reached as high as rm2.84 on oct 31, 2013  exceeding his target price of rm2.50, at the time. he has since downgraded his recommendation to hold, with a target price of rm2.71  a level the stock hit on dec 16. the price target had worked in a 5% discount to his rm2.85 sum-of-parts valuation of the company, which is 20% owned by cahya mata sarawak bhd. alliance research analyst ian wans call on carlsberg brewery malaysia bhd if alliance researchs ian wan had a crystal ball, he might have chosen to tell clients to buy a little more carlsberg brewery malaysia bhd shares at rm12 levels, given that the stock did appreciate another 42%, to reach a peak of rm17.06 on may 31, 2013. what impressed the judges, that they gave him a coveted spot in 2013, however, was how he rightly told clients to buy the stock, up to about the rm12 levels, and then correctly cut his recommendation to sell, on may 30, 2013  just before carlsberg peaked and began sliding. this was after the brewerys 1qfy2013 results came in below expectations, making up only 23.3% of alliance researchs full-year forecast. when the stock had shed some 29% to reach the rm12 levels again, wan raised his call to neutral on nov 19, 2013, despite the companys 3qfy2013 results, coming in below expectations yet again. he justified that the overall downside is limited, after the share price slid 24%, since his sell call on may 30. we believe, at its current valuation, market has largely priced in the challenging outlook. as such, we upgrade the stock from sell to neutral, he said in the report, while revising the target price to rm11.24, which implies 18.9 times earnings and a 5.3% yield for fy2014. will his call continue to prove prescient? dbs vickers research analyst quah he weis call on dayang enterprise holdings bhd dbs vickers researchs quah he wei, once wrote in his note, that dayang enterprise holdings bhd had [hit] a jackpot! investors who paid attention when he recommended that they buy dayang, as far back as july 2011, when the stock was going for rm1.80 apiece, would have hit a small jackpot of their own, as the stock price rallied in 2013. if measured from a low of rm2.302 in late-february 2013, dayangs shares had increased 147%, as it hit a 52-week high of rm5.69, on dec 13, 2013. on hindsight, the call would have been near perfect, had he only started coverage about a year earlier, when the stock was going for rm1.77. seven out of eight analysts polled on bloomberg, still have a buy on dayang, according to bloomberg data, at the time of writing. quahs rm5.90 target price is the most conservative, being rm1.08 or 15.5% below the most-bullish target price of rm6.98 apiece. at dec 16s rm5.59 close, quahs price target implied only 5.5% upside potential. regardless of whether a downgrade is in store, or if he will turn out to be overly conservative, he has earned a spot for the best recommendation, among the submissions received for consideration. that, in itself, warrants a pat on the back. this story first appeared in the edge weekly edition of dec 23-29, 2013."}, "532": {"date_posted": "19/2/2014", "title": "market close: klci posts 11th-hour gains on high trades of

performing emerging-market currency this year, after it weakened in 2013 by more than any other peer apart from argentinas peso. the shortfall in the broadest measure of trade was 1.98 percent of gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, down from 3.8 percent in the previous three months and a record 4.4 percent in the second quarter, the central bank reported yesterday as it left interest rates unchanged. the data spurred a 1.8 percent two-day advance in the rupiah to 11,868 per dollar in jakarta, the biggest jump in more than a month and extending this years gain to 2.5 percent, according to prices from local banks. global funds have pumped more than $1 billion into indonesias stocks and bonds in 2014 as the country reported decembers trade surplus was the biggest in more than two years. maybank and morgan stanley predict further rupiah appreciation if jakarta governor joko widodo, known locally as jokowi, wins a july presidential election. he is currently topping voter surveys after clamping down on tax evasion and pushing ahead with stalled transport projects in the capital. the risk in the indonesian rupiah has eased as the current-account deficit is narrowing, joey cuyegkeng, an economist at ing groep nv in manila, said yesterday. political uncertainty has also eased because the front-runner is a reform- minded candidate. trade surplus the rupiah surged 1 percent today as of 8:51 a.m. and touched 11,840, the strongest level since dec. 3, prices from local banks show. it has rallied 2.5 percent this week, the most since october. in the last two weeks, morgan stanley forecast a jokowi victory would strengthen the rupiah to 11,800 by year-end and maybank predicted an advance to 11,300. the u.s. bank, which included the rupiah last year in a fragile five list of emerging-market currencies that were vulnerable to outflows because of weak external positions, boosted its stance on indonesian shares in january, citing low valuations. the rupiah plunged 21 percent in 2013, the most in 13 years. the other fragile five currencies, indias rupee, turkeys lira, brazils real and south africas rand are down between 1 and 4.4 percent against the dollar this year. indonesias exports increased 10.3 percent in december from a year earlier, the most since october 2011, official data showed feb. 3. coupled with an 0.8 percent decline in imports, that widened the trade excess to $1.5 billion. foreign funds bought 8.69 trillion rupiah ($731 million) more local-currency debt than they sold this year through feb. 11, finance ministry data show. they had pumped $379 million into local stocks as of yesterday, making indonesia the only one of eight asian markets tracked by bloomberg to see share inflows this year. the jakarta composite index has risen 5.4 percent in 2014, leading gains among benchmark gauges in southeast asias five biggest stock markets. jokowi factor the flows were driven by the improvement in our economic numbers, said arief wana, a jakarta-based managing partner at pt ashmore asset management indonesia, a unit of ashmore group that manages $75.3 billion. investors are also betting that jokowi will run for president. the yield on indonesias 10-year government bonds fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.76 percent, inter dealer market association data shows. the yield has dropped 27 basis points in february after surging 326 basis points last year amid speculation the federal reserve would cut monetary stimulus. the u.s. central bank has reduced its purchases of treasuries and mortgage debt to $65 billion a month, from $85 billion last year. indonesia was worst hit during the selloff last year, so we would expect inflows to rebound faster here than in other emerging markets as funds return to buy up cheaper assets, handy yunianto, the jakarta-based head of fixed-income research at pt mandiri sekuritas, a unit of the nations largest lender by assets, said yesterday. investors are more keen on equities as bonds delivered large losses last year. slowing inflation the current-account deficit was probably about 3.26 percent of gdp for the whole of last year and may narrow to 2.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2015, bank indonesia deputy governor perry warjiyo said yesterday. the monetary authority predicted inflation, which was 8.22 percent in january, would slow to 4.9 percent by the end of the year. the current account issue of last year now appears to be solved as it has narrowed to a sustainable level, nurul eti nurbaeti, head of treasury research at pt bank negara indonesia in jakarta, said yesterday. with positive data from the domestic side and provided external factors remain conducive, we can see the rupiah continue its rally this quarter."}, "539": {"date_posted": "14/2/2014", "title": "technicals: rebound capped between 1,826 and 1,839", "article": " european share markets were generally softer yesterday as

caused the index to decline yesterday. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represents an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the next few months index price movements since may 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low) and 1,882.20 (high). the indexs daily signals (cci, dmi, macd and stochastic) are mainly positive except its oscillator. as such, the indexs obvious support levels are seen at 1,769, 1,795 and 1,812 points, while the resistance areas of 1,818, 1,839 and all-time high of 1,882 points will witness some very heavy profit taking. our rebound retracement targets of 1,826 (50% level) and 1,839.26 (62% level) may cap the index in the short to medium term. therefore, the index could remain trapped with the broader ranges of 1,882 and 1,769 points for now. its simple moving averages depict a mixed tone for its chart timeframes. its daily chart has turned neutral, while the weekly and monthly charts appear buoyant for now. due to its mixed chart signals, we believe investors may adopt a range trading philosophy for the fbmklci. some rotational play into quality mid cap stocks may result. due to the rebound tone of the fbmklci, we are recommending a chart buy on perdana petroleum bhd. maybank-ib has an unchanged buy call on the stock with a revised target price for the stock of rm2.55 from rm1.90 following an 11% to 32% rise in its financial year 2013 (fy13) to fy15 earnings forecast. our analyst expects this outperformance to be fuelled by higher utilisation and lower operating expenses. with an improved cash flow and balance sheet position, perdana is well-positioned to expand its fleet size. our fundamental analyst thinks that the market has underestimated the stock but a strong fourth quarter fy13 result may spur investor optimism. a check on bloomberg consensus reveals nine brokers cover the stock. of these, seven have buy ratings, one has a sell call and one has a hold. the stock is currently trading at a lofty historical price-earnings ratio of 56.9 times and a very high price-to-book value of 2.6 times.  perdanas chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly timeframes are very strong indeed. its share price made an obvious surge since its weekly wave-4 low of rm1.19 in august 2013. since that rm1.19 low, perdana rose to its recent february 2014 high of rm1.96. its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to its recent february 2014 high of rm1.96. as it broke above its recent key critical resistance levels of rm1.51 and rm1.75, look to buy perdana on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to medium-term uptrends for this stock.  the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, oscillator, macd and stochastic) are very strong and now depict the obvious indications of perdanas eventual rise towards much higher levels. we expect perdana to remain very firm towards its support levels of rm1.51, rm1.75 and rm1.92. it will attract minor profit taking at the resistance levels of rm1.98, rm2.08 and rm2.44. its upside targets are now located at rm2.18, rm2.37, rm2.80 and rm3.12. lee cheng hooi is

second most active stock yesterday. sch managing director lau mong ling said the group is confident of a transfer to the main market in two to three years, as it outlines its strategy to increase the share of the domestic quarry market to 22.5% from 17.5% currently. the group also plans to tap into the larger asean market with its high-end quarry equipment and machinery such as loader machines and quarry crushers, he said. sch sources its quarry machinery from three key manufacturers, namely nakayama, junjin csm and alpha plus. the [profit] margin for these high-end products is better and the turnover sizeable. one machine can easily cost between rm800,000 and rm1 million, lau told reporters after the listing ceremony yesterday. sch aims to sell its products directly to end users which will provide a better margin control. lau said the group expects double-digit growth in revenue for the financial year ending aug 31, 2014 from rm61.25 million a year ago as it expands its product range and explores new business ventures such as quarry design. lau, together with two other shareholders and co-founders wong sin chin and yeen yoon hin, collectively hold 69% equity interest in sch group. sch supplies quarry industrial products, quarry machinery, quarry equipment and reconditioned quarry machinery as well as spare parts to the quarry industry in malaysia and southeast asia. it

affordable reconditioned quarry machinery business, lau said the group plans to expand to other asean countries, including cambodia, thailand and vietnam. the price of the reconditioned quarry machinery is almost half of the new ones, according to a report by maybank ib research on tuesday. this is suitable for some smaller quarries in sabah, sarawak and southeast asia due to their affordability, it said. sch has no dividend policy, but m&a securities sdn bhd head of corporate finance gary ting said the groups balance sheet is strong with good cash flow, which stood at rm6.7

elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the price movements in the index in the next few months following may 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low) and 1,882.20 (high). the indexs daily signals (cci, dmi, oscillator, macd and stochastic) are all negative. as such, the indexs weaker support levels are seen at 1,759, 1,769 and 1,790 points, while the resistance areas of 1,799, 1,838 and all-time high of 1,882 points will witness some very heavy profit taking. our downside targets of 1,742, 1,730 and 1,682 points for the index in the short to medium term have now emerged out of the bearish price moves since dec 31, 2013. its simple moving averages (ma) depict a mixed tone for its chart timeframes. its daily and weekly charts have turned negative, while the monthly chart appears buoyant for now. due to its mixed chart signals, we believe investors may adopt a take profit philosophy as the klci remains at fairly lofty levels with bearish divergent signals. as such, profit taking on index components as well as small to mid caps will persist this month. due to the bearish tone of the klci, we are recommending a chart sell on british american tobacco (m) bhd (bat), which is a rm17.36 billion market cap company, the second largest listed entity on the klci consumer index after ppb group. bats return on equity based on its 12-month trailing earnings is 168.6%. a check on some of the current holdings on bloomberg show institutional funds such as blackrock and the employees provident fund have taken some profit based on the filings shown. the poorer investor sentiment may be attributed to the large number of sell calls for the stock, which suggest that the stock is most likely fully valued at its current traded price. looking at the consensus average target price of rm60.12 and no near term catalyst, any upside for the stock may be limited. a check on bloomberg consensus reveals 19 brokers covering the stock. two of them have buy ratings, 10 sell and seven hold. the stock is currently trading at a historical price-earnings ratio of 20.7 times and a very high price-to-book value of 33.6 times. bats indicated dividend yield is at a high 4.6%. bats chart trends on the daily and weekly timeframes are very weak indeed. its share price made an obvious plunge since its weekly wave-5 and all-time high of rm68 in may 2013. since that rm68 high, bat has declined to its recent june 2013 low of rm56.58. its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly downtrends to its recent february 2014 low of rm59.50. as it broke above its recent key critical supports of rm63.20 and rm62.60, look to sell bat on any rallies to its resistance areas as the moving averages depict very firm short- to medium-term downtrends for this stock. the daily and weekly indicators (like the cci, dmi, oscillator, stochastic and macd) are very negative and now depict the obvious indications of bats eventual decline towards much lower levels. we expect bat to remain very weak towards its support levels of rm56.58, rm58.20 and rm59.50. it will attract major liquidation activities at the resistance levels of rm60.80, rm62.60 and rm68. its downside targets are now located at rm58.44, rm54.68 and rm53.05. lee cheng hooi is the regional chartist at

on the forecast earnings for 2013 and a price-to-book value of about 1.7 times. when compared with key industry players such as malayan banking bhd and public bank bhd, cimb groups valuations are not expensive. if investors are selling because they are worried that cimb groups balance sheet has been impaired by cimb niaga, the concern may be a tad overdone. the banking group has been posting strong earnings growth in recent years. moving forward, analysts generally expect this uptrend to continue, although the growth momentum this year and the next may not be as strong as before. in fact, the overall banking industry is unlikely to chart the robust growth rates that it did in the last few years. based on net earnings of rm3.502 billion recorded during the first nine months of 2013,

where the operating environment has become more treacherous with higher interest rates, a wide current account deficit and a depreciating rupiah. on top of that, the outlook is clouded by a presidential election due this year. thus, despite cimb niaga posting a higher pre-tax profit growth of 2.5% in the first nine months of 2013, the depreciating rupiah has caused its contribution to group earnings in ringgit terms to fall 4% during the period. indonesia contributes some 30% to cimb groups earnings, compared with about 10% for maybank, the other banking group with a huge presence there. while indonesia has turned more challenging, the outlook isnt all doom and gloom as the government there is already taking steps to address the problems. a financial crisis is unlikely, barring black swan events. what will happen is that loans growth will come down from the 30% growth levels to the mid-teens, and asset quality may face some erosion as interest rates rise.  thus, the fund-raising exercise is a pre-emptive move by cimb group to cushion itself against a further weakening in the rupiah, which could prevent it from achieving its internal target of 9.5% to 10% for common equity tier 1 (cet-1) by 2015. we believe this is a wise move given that a further fall in the rupiah could erode the groups cet-1 capital to below 8% without the additional rm3.55 billion

property business, helped ijm corp bhds earnings for the first half of fy2014 ended sept 30, to come in ahead of analysts expectations.  now, analysts expect the company to post sterling results for

and have a rm4 strike price and a one-for-one conversion ratio. as ijms fy2014 ends in march 2014, the warrants stand a good chance of benefiting from any upside potential for the companys earnings.  at present, ijm-wc is trading at close to zero premium to the underlying share, as indicated by its 0.35% discount to ijms closing price of rm5.76 on nov 25, 2013. since the beginning of 2013, the warrants have gained 46% and closed at rm1.74 on nov 25. in a nov 26, 2013, filing with bursa malaysia, ijm announced a net profit of rm140.3 million for 2qfy2014  a 2.2% increase from rm137.26 million in 2qfy2013. that brought net profit for 1hfy2014 to rm304.64 million  an encouraging 34% increase, from rm226.09 million in 1hfy2013. in a nov 27, 2013 report that introduced a higher target price, maybank investment bank research says ijms current valuation of 13.2 times fy2014 earnings, has yet to reflect its strategic property landbank, the expansion of kuantan port and the development potential of the ports adjacent industrial land.  we now incorporate stronger property earnings into our estimates, deriving higher fy2014-2015 net profits. subsequently, we have set a higher target price of rm6.75 for the stock, the research house says. the target price of rm6.75 represents a 17% premium to ijms closing price of rm5.76 on nov 25, 2013. assuming a zero premium to the mother share, ijm-wc should theoretically be worth about rm2.75 apiece (rm6.75 minus rm4). this implies an upside potential of 58% for the warrants, based on their closing price of rm1.74 on nov 25, 2013. the property sector continues to be the key earnings contributor (48% of 1hfy2014 core pre-tax profit), as progress billings increased 73% year-on-year, says maybank-ib. it attributes ijms 46% surge in 1hfy2014 group core net profit, to higher contribution from the companys property, industrial and infrastructure divisions. rhb research institute, meanwhile, values ijm at rm6.21 apiece, pointing

up production of nitrile gloves as they compete for market share in the high-margin product in order to satisfy european demand and offset the recent hike in energy prices.  the big four glove makers  hartalega holdings bhd, top glove corp bhd, kossan rubber industries bhd and supermax corp bhd  are moving towards realigning their product mix, putting emphasis on nitrile glove production over that of natural rubber (nr) and vinyl gloves. top glove and hartalega are the leading players in the nitrile segment. hartalega is the worlds largest nitrile glove producer with a production capacity of 14 billion pieces per annum while top glove currently produces 10 billion pieces. all four firms plan to increase their nitrile production capacity by at least 22% by the end of this year. in a pre-emptive move, kossan is already gearing up to become the worlds biggest nitrile producer by end-2015, overtaking both hartalega and top glove in the process. the firm plans to ramp up its capacity by 59% this year to 13.5 billion pieces, from 8.5 billion presently.  as part of its aggressive expansion plan, kossan recently acquired land in klang to house its new manufacturing plant, which is expected to add another five billion pieces per annum in capacity.  we hope to have a product mix ratio of 70:30 between nitrile and nr products by the end of this year. there are three new plants in the pipeline, with the first one expected to be operational very soon, says edward yip, kossans general manager of corporate affairs and business development, at the spotlight on malaysia 2014 forum organised by bursa malaysia last week. nitriles appeal comes from its position as a premium product over nr gloves. synthetic rubber products have become the preferred choice by consumers due to the increasing prevalence of latex allergies, which may occur with prolonged contact to nr gloves. hartalega is the clear leader in this segment because of its consistently high utilisation rates and its preference for nitrile production, which contributed 92% of total sales during the first half of its financial year ending march 31, 2014 (1hfy14). alongside kossan, supermax is looking to replicate this strategy with a planned expansion of its nitrile capacity by 128% this year, according to data compiled by maybank ib research. while top glove plans to increase its own nitrile capacity by 22%, the company is currently encumbered by the margin squeeze in its nr gloves segment due to higher latex prices and low average selling price. also, it is still seeing operating losses at its manufacturing plants in china.  the rising production of nitrile gloves is an ongoing trend as the product offers higher margins due to its higher selling price. however, with an additional 13 billion pieces expected to hit the market this year, one wonders if it would contribute to an oversupply in the market. in a jan 16 note, maybank ib research says demand will likely come from europe, where nitrile gloves command a 50% market share, compared with 80% in the us. global demand is also expected to pick up by 15%-20% this year. over the longer term, the demand for nitrile remains favourable with room for growth. capacity expansion in 2014 is expected to be led by kossan and supermax, which have already put in the infrastructure and secured the gas supply for their production lines, it says. kossans yip points out that in spite of the recent hike in electricity and gas tariffs, the group remains confident of maintaining its profit margins with its nitrile growth expansion plan. we had already anticipated and prepared for this [energy hikes]. labour costs also increased by 44% following the minimum wage implementation in july last year, but our margins kept increasing anyway, he says. to deal with escalating energy prices, glove makers have raised their asp by 1% to pass through the higher electricity costs beginning this month.  however, cheaper raw materials, which make up nearly half of the production costs, could ensure that margins remain stable in spite of the energy cost inflation. it is worth noting that latex prices have fallen to a four-year low of rm4.84 per kg due to expectation of rising supply. the main beneficiary of this would be top glove as it is the largest nr glove producer, says maybank ib research. analysts say that the persisting nitrile theme may continue to boost the stock prices of the big four firms. cimb research has an outperform call on both kossan and supermax, while maybank ib research has a buy call on kossan and top glove. in terms of share price performance, top glove has lagged its peers after recording only a 0.65% gain between jan 2 and dec 31 last year. during the same period, kossans shares gained 161%, followed by hartalega (54%) and supermax (46%). a useful metric for comparing the production efficiency among the big four glove makers is the gross earnings generated per thousand gloves produced. in the third quarter of last year (3qcy13), hartalega registered gross earnings of rm28.90 per thousand gloves, followed by kossan (rm12.50), supermax (rm10) and top glove (rm7.70). according to a jan 7 note by alliance research, the glove makers will be able to continue delivering decent earnings growth this year. we remain optimistic that the glove sector will be able to deliver earnings growth of 14%, underpinned by (1) stable latex costs, (2) weaker ringgit against the usd, and (3) healthy competition which could foster a stronger glove manufacturing industry in malaysia, it says.  while there will be stiff competition among the glove players in the nitrile segment, it is also important to note that having the highest production capacity alone does not necessarily guarantee higher margins.  the firms will have to focus on increasing operational efficiency, as well as making sure that they are not over-leveraged when undertaking aggressive expansion plans. this article first appeared in

ramp up production of nitrile gloves as they compete for market share in the high-margin product in order to satisfy european demand and offset the recent hike in energy prices.  the big four glove makers  hartalega holdings bhd, top glove corp bhd, kossan rubber industries bhd and supermax corp bhd  are moving towards realigning their product mix, putting emphasis on nitrile glove production over that of natural rubber (nr) and vinyl gloves. top glove and hartalega are the leading players in the nitrile segment. hartalega is the worlds largest nitrile glove producer with a production capacity of 14 billion pieces per annum while top glove currently produces 10 billion pieces. all four firms plan to increase their nitrile production capacity by at least 22% by the end of this year. in a pre-emptive move, kossan is already gearing up to become the worlds biggest nitrile producer by end-2015, overtaking both hartalega and top glove in the process. the firm plans to ramp up its capacity by 59% this year to 13.5 billion pieces, from 8.5 billion presently.  as part of its aggressive expansion plan, kossan recently acquired land in klang to house its new manufacturing plant, which is expected to add another five billion pieces per annum in capacity.  we hope to have a product mix ratio of 70:30 between nitrile and nr products by the end of this year. there are three new plants in the pipeline, with the first one expected to be operational very soon, says edward yip, kossans general manager of corporate affairs and business development, at the spotlight on malaysia 2014 forum organised by bursa malaysia last week. nitriles appeal comes from its position as a premium product over nr gloves. synthetic rubber products have become the preferred choice by consumers due to the increasing prevalence of latex allergies, which may occur with prolonged contact to nr gloves. hartalega is the clear leader in this segment because of its consistently high utilisation rates and its preference for nitrile production, which contributed 92% of total sales during the first half of its financial year ending march 31, 2014 (1hfy14). alongside kossan, supermax is looking to replicate this strategy with a planned expansion of its nitrile capacity by 128% this year, according to data compiled by maybank ib research. while top glove plans to increase its own nitrile capacity by 22%, the company is currently encumbered by the margin squeeze in its nr gloves segment due to higher latex prices and low average selling price. also, it is still seeing operating losses at its manufacturing plants in china.  the rising production of nitrile gloves is an ongoing trend as the product offers higher margins due to its higher selling price. however, with an additional 13 billion pieces expected to hit the market this year, one wonders if it would contribute to an oversupply in the market. in a jan 16 note, maybank ib research says demand will likely come from europe,

"article": " the market capitalisation of umw oil & gas corp bhd (umw-og) has soared although it has only been listed on bursa malaysia for less than three months. the groups market cap stood at rm9.06 billion on jan 22 thanks to the gains in its share price, which closed at rm4.19 on the same day. this represents a staggering 49% increase from its initial public offering (ipo) issue price of rm2.80 per share, which implied a total capitalisation of rm6.05 billion. according to umw-og president rohaizad darus, the incoming deliveries of new jack-up (ju) drilling rigs will boost the groups earnings substantially over the next two years. drilling services contributed 94% to its total revenue for the first nine months of last year (9m2013). its simple mathematics. our four operational rigs currently generate a certain amount of revenue. if we add another one, our bottom line will increase by 25%, he says during a media briefing last thursday. rohaizad was referring to naga 5, the groups latest premium ju rig, which is scheduled for delivery in may. umw-og has already secured a us$7 million contract from nido petroleum philippines pty ltd for the provision of drilling services by the new rig. apart from its ju fleet, the group is also the sole malaysian operator of hydraulic workover units (hwus), with four currently being deployed in three countries on short- and long-term tenures. coupled with a rm1 billion war chest from its ipo proceeds after deducting last years expenses, rohaizad is confident that the group can leverage on its working relationship with petroliam nasional bhd and other oil majors to secure new contracts for its ju rigs and hwus. we believe we are able to finance a significant number of new rigs and also secure new contracts due to the increasing regional demand. despite its recent share price gains, there are contrasting valuations on the company by research houses. according to bloomberg data, the consensus analyst view is mostly bearish with 9 out of 13 research houses issuing a neutral or sell rating on umw-og. the most bullish are maybank ib research and cimb research, which set a target price of rm4.80 and rm4.63 respectively. at the other end of the spectrum is goldman sachs research, which set a fair value of a mere rm2.70 on the oil and gas operator. in a jan 20 note, maybank ib argues that the delivery of another two ju rigs  naga 6 and naga 7  by 2015 warrants a premium valuation on the stock. at rm4.80 per share, the research firm has pegged umw-ogs shares at 23 times projected earnings for fy2015. in its calculations, maybank ib projected that umw-ogs core net profit and core earnings per share will triple within two years after taking into account the additional revenue boost from the three upcoming ju rigs. the market now demands new, premium jus, favoured for their superior security, cost and operating features. more importantly, umw-og has the balance sheet strength to expand its ju fleet size beyond the projected five units, it says. however, it is worth noting that new contracts are the lifeblood of oil and gas companies. umw-ogs contract backlog stands at rm1.45 billion, a small figure compared with the order books of other big caps such as sapurakencana petroleum bhd (rm28 billion) and bumi armada bhd (rm10.8 billion), says alliance research, which has a sell call on the stock, pegging the fair value at rm3.16. the research outfit says umw-ogs valuation has exceeded its peers, whose shares are currently trading at lower price-earnings multiples. while the growth outlook for umw-og is promising, especially if the group adds on new rigs, we view that valuations have run too far ahead of peers at this juncture, it says. at the moment, a huge chunk of umw-ogs revenue comes from contracts awarded by petronas carigali sdn bhd (pcsb), with three out of four rigs deployed for the upstream players needs. apart from pcsb, umw-ogs client base for the ju rigs consists of hess, japan vietnam petroleum co and nido petroleum. underlining its regional expansion plans, rohaizad says the group is working towards achieving a 50-50 revenue contribution from domestic and overseas operations respectively. for 9m2013, 66% of its revenue came from malaysia. naga 3 will be moved to vietnam while naga 5 will be operating in the philippines, where we have never been to before. we also have a presence in china, thailand, indonesia and turkmenistan in various capacities. the bullish outlook is mainly supported by the upcoming expiration of a whopping 41 ju rig contracts in southeast asia this year. in malaysia, there are currently 18 jus, of which 16 are foreign owned. in line with the growing demand, daily charter rates for jus have accordingly risen over the past four years. according to maybank ib, average day rates are now holding steadily at us$150,000 and should rise to between us$160,000 and us$170,000 levels due to the favourable oil price environment as well as a mismatch between demand and supply. however, it is apparent that the group will have to aggressively expand its operations and secure new contracts on a consistent basis,

"title": "#highlight* is the bullish outlook on umw-og justified?", "article": " the market capitalisation of umw oil & gas corp bhd (umw-og) has soared although it has only been listed on bursa malaysia for less than three months. the groups market cap stood at rm9.06 billion on jan 22 thanks to the gains in its share price, which closed at rm4.19 on the same day. this represents a staggering 49% increase from its initial public offering (ipo) issue price of rm2.80 per share, which implied a total capitalisation of rm6.05 billion. according to umw-og president rohaizad darus, the incoming deliveries of new jack-up (ju) drilling rigs will boost the groups earnings substantially over the next two years. drilling services contributed 94% to its total revenue for the first nine months of last year (9m2013). its simple mathematics. our four operational rigs currently generate a certain amount of revenue. if we add another one, our bottom line will increase by 25%, he says during a media briefing last thursday. rohaizad was referring to naga 5, the groups latest premium ju rig, which is scheduled for delivery in may. umw-og has already secured a us$7 million contract from nido petroleum philippines pty ltd for the provision of drilling services by the new rig. apart from its ju fleet, the group is also the sole malaysian operator of hydraulic workover units (hwus), with four currently being deployed in three countries on short- and long-term tenures. coupled with a rm1 billion war chest from its ipo proceeds after deducting last years expenses, rohaizad is confident that the group can leverage on its working relationship with petroliam nasional bhd and other oil majors to secure new contracts for its ju rigs and hwus. we believe we are able to finance a significant number of new rigs and also secure new contracts due to the increasing regional demand. despite its recent share price gains, there are contrasting valuations on the company by research houses. according to bloomberg data, the consensus analyst view is mostly bearish with 9 out of 13 research houses issuing a neutral or sell rating on umw-og. the most bullish are maybank ib research and cimb research, which set a target price of rm4.80 and rm4.63 respectively. at the other end of the spectrum is goldman sachs research, which set a fair value of a mere rm2.70 on the oil and gas operator. in a jan 20 note, maybank ib argues that the delivery of another two ju rigs  naga 6 and naga 7  by 2015 warrants a premium valuation on the stock. at rm4.80 per share, the research firm has pegged umw-ogs shares at 23 times projected earnings for fy2015. in its calculations, maybank ib projected that umw-ogs core net profit and core earnings per share will triple within two years after taking into account the additional revenue boost from the three upcoming ju rigs. the market now demands new, premium jus, favoured for their superior security, cost and operating features. more importantly, umw-og has the balance sheet strength to expand its ju fleet size beyond the projected five units, it says. however, it is worth noting that new contracts are the lifeblood of oil and gas companies. umw-ogs contract backlog stands at rm1.45 billion, a small figure compared with the order books of other big caps such as sapurakencana petroleum bhd (rm28 billion) and bumi armada bhd (rm10.8 billion), says alliance research, which has a sell call on the stock, pegging the fair value at rm3.16. the research outfit says umw-ogs valuation has exceeded its peers, whose shares are currently trading at lower price-earnings multiples. while the growth outlook for umw-og is promising, especially if the group adds on new rigs, we view that valuations have run too far ahead of peers at this juncture, it says. at the moment, a huge chunk of umw-ogs revenue comes from contracts awarded by petronas carigali sdn bhd (pcsb), with three out of four rigs deployed for the upstream players needs. apart from pcsb, umw-ogs client base for the ju rigs consists of hess, japan vietnam petroleum co and nido petroleum. underlining its regional expansion plans, rohaizad says the group is working towards achieving a 50-50 revenue contribution from domestic and overseas operations respectively. for 9m2013, 66% of its revenue came from malaysia. naga 3 will be moved to vietnam while naga 5 will be operating in the philippines, where we have never been to before. we also have a presence in china, thailand, indonesia and turkmenistan in various capacities. the bullish outlook is mainly supported by the upcoming expiration of a whopping 41 ju rig contracts in southeast asia this year. in malaysia, there are currently 18 jus, of which 16 are foreign owned. in line with the growing demand, daily charter rates for jus have accordingly risen over the past four years. according to maybank ib, average day rates are now holding steadily at us$150,000 and should rise to between us$160,000 and us$170,000 levels due to the favourable oil price environment as well as a mismatch between demand and supply. however, it is apparent that the group will have to aggressively expand its operations and secure new contracts on a consistent basis, either one of which is no small task. the drilling services industry also remains highly competitive, and there is no shortage of international oil and gas operators bidding for the same projects that umw-og is gunning for. umw-og will be spending its cash pile on two new rigs  naga 6 and naga 7. will petronas, which is the companys major client, also deploy the new jack-up rigs? that will determine whether the bullishness on the stock is justifiable. this story first appeared in the edge malaysia weekly edition,

lowered our earnings forecasts on ayala by 10%, to php14.26 billion for 2013, to reflect our lower trading income assumption for bpi. although the banks core banking business performed broadly as expected, trading income fell short of our target. thus, we reduce our 2013 earnings estimate on bpi, by 16%.pt mitrabahtera segara sejati tbktarget price: idr1,400 buy rhb research (nov 20): we believe mitrabahtera should be able to book higher coal volumes in 2013 and 2014, despite the possibility of clients renegotiating their rates, as long-term customers will bulk up volumes to compensate for lower fees.  we trim our 2013 and 2014 earnings estimates by 5% and 9% respectively, as 9mfy13 net profit fell short of our expectations, accounting for 67% of fy13f numbers. although total coal volume transported in 9mfy13 reached 57 million tonnes (77% of fy13f), mitrabahtera charged rates that were lower than our expectations. thus, we cut our blended fee per tonne assumptions across its segments, by 10% and 18%, for 2013 and 2014 respectively, as we predict that it would shift to shorter-distance trips and offer competitive or lower rates to customers, amid a challenging coal market. we also raise our aggregate coal volume assumption by 8-19%, for 2013-14. with mitrabahtera having a cash pile of us$30 million as at 9mfy13, we are assuming a reasonable 25% dividend payout policy for 2013 earnings, which translates into an attractive 6% dividend yield for 2014. despite cutting its estimates, the stock is still trading at a very cheap four times 2013-14 earnings. we maintain a buy call, but lower our discounted cash flow-based target price to idr1,400 (from idr1,500), while trimming our earnings estimates for 2013 and 2014. midas holdings ltdfair value: s$0.67 buy ocbc investment research (nov 18): midas 3qfy13 results exceeded our expectations, with revenue jumping 48.5% y-o-y to rmb301 million, or 15.8% above our forecast.  gross margin of 20.8%, down 10.7 percentage points, disappointed due to a change in the product mix, as more aluminium extrusion profile deliveries were made to the lower margin freight wagons, while there was also an increase in per unit production cost. nevertheless, the bottom line reversed from a rmb6.1 million net loss in 3qfy12, to a net profit of rmb16.4 million. midas recently clinched rmb167.5 million of contracts to supply aluminium alloy extrusion profiles, for the manufacture of high-speed railway (hsr) train cars. we expect the bulk of this contribution to be booked in 4qfy13, with the remainder in 1qfy14, due to the tight delivery schedules from customers. meanwhile, china railway corporation recently opened the second round of hsr train car tenders. this involves a total of 258 train car sets, of which 78 are for a speed of 250kph, and 180 for a speed of 350kph (higher value). we believe the potential market size for aluminium alloy extrusion profile suppliers, may amount to rmb715.5 million. we estimate that midas could secure rmb325 million to rmb380 million of contracts from its customers, from this procurement exercise, in late december 2013 or early january 2014. this story first

gross development value (gdv) is estimated at rm148.7 million, and we understand that bina puri has a 60% stake in the proposed development. the 4,291 sq m development consists of 10 shoplots on the

the groups total potential gdv in property development, to about rm2.5 billion.  we expect this project to be launched in mid-2014. assuming an ebit margin of 4% for the project, we believe it will enhance bina puris bottom line by rm100,000 in fy14, and rm500,000 in fy15 and fy16. we raise our earnings forecast for fy14-16 by 0.7%, to 1.9%. bumi armada bhdtarget price: rm4.83 buy midf research (nov 18): bumi armada has received a letter of intent from enquest, confirming its intention to award the contract for the supply and operation of a floating production storage and offloading vessel, for the kraken field in the north sea. the award was expected to be signed before nov 30, 2013. first oil is expected to be produced by 2016 or 2017.  we maintain our earnings forecast at this juncture, as we have incorporated potential earnings from this new contract. we estimate this contract to be worth around us$1 billion (rm3.18 billion).  we maintain our buy recommendation, premised on: (i) expanding top line; (ii) increasing order book quality value, with sizeable extension options; (iii) sustainable margins of more than 20%; and (iv) an undemanding valuation. we value bumi armada at rm4.83 per share, derived from forward per for fy14 of 21 times, and fy14 eps of 23 sen. at this juncture, it trades at a forward per of 16.5 times. this is below its average per of 26 times, since its listing in 2011. umw oil & gas corp bhdtarget price: rm3.16 neutral alliance research (nov 19): umw oil & gas reported 3qfy13 and 9mfy13 core net profits of rm51 million and rm102.2 million, respectively. its 9mfy13 core net profit made up 78.5% of our estimate, and 59.8% of consensus estimate. core net profit was adjusted for a rm30.4 million gain on property disposal.  its 9mfy13 results made up slightly more than 75% of full-year estimate, as naga 2 had got a higher time charter rate for a spot charter in vietnam. compared with consensus, we view that the results could be lower, because consensus numbers might be distorted by the property gain.  we raise our fy13 net profit by 4.4%, to reflect the higher-than-expected time charter rate for naga 2. we also raise our estimated daily charter rate of us$150,000 (rm477,000) per day, to us$200,000, for this six-month spot charter. we maintain our target price of rm3.16. this is based on fy15 eps of 15.8 sen, pegging an industry peak cycle average per of 20 times. tsh resources bhdtarget price: rm3 buy maybank investment bank (nov 20): tshs 3qfy13 net profit was boosted by gains from the disposal of pontian united plantations shares (rm85 million), which partially offset foreign exchange losses (rm44 million). stripping one-offs, 3qfy13 core net profit of rm31.6 million (up 46% q-o-q and 110% y-o-y) took 9mfy13 net profit to rm73 million (up 50% y-o-y), accounting for 85% of our estimate and 82% of consensus estimate. with the strongest fresh fruit bunch (ffb) output growth among peers, vast unplanted land and improving gearing position, tshs stock is due for a rerating. as we raise our earnings forecasts and target fy14 per to 19 times, from 17 times, tsh is a buy, with a higher target price of rm3 (up 10%). since we expect output to peak in 4qfy13, tshs 9mfy13 production (up 34% y-o-y), which accounted for 74% of our fy13 estimate, has surpassed our forecast. the strong production growth is driven by its young and fertile oil palm estates in kalimantan. we raise our fy13 and fy14 production forecasts by 6% and 5%, respectively. lafarge malaysia bhdtarget price: rm9.85 fully valued hwangdbs vickers research (nov 20): lafarges 3qfy13 net profit of rm120 million, was 25% higher y-o-y (up 48% q-o-q). its operating margins rose 21.5%, compared with 3qfy12s 18.7% and 2qfy13s 14.6%. this was mainly due to improved plant performance and fewer maintenance shutdowns, during the period. higher domestic demand from infrastructure projects and lower coal prices (down 14% y-o-y and 10% q-o-q) may have also played a part in the higher margins. this brought 9mfy13 earnings to 76% of our estimate, and 74% of consensus full-year estimate. we think the near-term outlook for the cement industry will be challenging, in view of the governments move to cut back on its major infrastructure projects and slower property construction activity, post-budget 2014.  while lafarges specialised cement solutions should mitigate the volatile rebates on ordinary portland cement, we believe that overall macro concerns do not justify the stocks premium valuations and low dividend yield. our price target is pegged at 17 times fy14f eps. cimb group holdings bhdtarget price: rm8.40 buy ta securities (nov 19): results are broadly within expectations, accounting for 73% of our estimate and consensus full-year estimate. annualised return on equity stood at 16%, which is within managements target.  net profit rose 7.3% y-o-y, underpinned by stronger contributions from consumer and corporate banking. meanwhile, contributions from investment banking and treasury and markets, contracted.  net interest income (nii) advanced 7.3% (up 1.6% q-o-q), on stronger loans growth of 14.2%. in local currency terms, singapore and thailand led, with a 41.8% and 28.7% y-o-y increase. nevertheless, nii was muted by weaker net interest margin, which fell 21 bps y-o-y. non-nii saw losses arising from financial assets held for trading, amounting to rm143.6 million versus gains of rm66.7 million, in 9mfy12.  we maintain our target price at rm8.40, which translates into an implied forward fy14 price-by-volume value of 2 times  slightly above the industrys average fy13 price-to-book value of 1.8 times. we maintain our buy recommendation.  this story first appeared in the edge weekly edition

the malay economic action council (mtem) on petroliam nasional bhd (petronas) to grant contracts to local companies rather than foreign companies will not dampen the oil & gas (o&g) sector outlook this year, said maybank kim eng research pte ltd. last week the coalition of malay non-governmental organisations called for the resignation of tan sri shamsul azhar abas, petronas ceo and president, if he could not look after the interest of bumiputera companies. speaking at a conference on the years outlook on saturday, maybanks executive director of research ong seng yeow said the focus would be on petronas budget of rm300 billion allocated for five years from 2011 to 2015. i do not think this issue will dampen the outlook for the o&g sector. we have to remember that the rm300 billion budget petronas allocated for capital expenditure has two years left, said ong during the weekend conference. he highlighted: they [petronas] have already utilised 50% of the allocated budget. they have to utilise the remainder of the budget. so, we are bullish on the visibility of future contracts. ong also noted petronas has been committing more of its firepower into the rapid (refinery and petrochemical integrated development) project in pengerang, johor and the sabah ammonia urea (samur) project. ong said the o&g sector should be assessed via its underlying fundamentals that are driving demand in the sector, noting that oil price is not the big draw. the o&g upstream segment looks very appealing to us, he said. drilling activities have been on the rise. rig utilisation levels are back to the pre-crisis levels. the charter day-to-day rates, consequently, are on the rise too as well as the offshore support vessel (osv). he pointed out the o&g sector is very liquid and is drawing institutional interest. our top pick for the sector is bumi armada bhd given it is a direct proxy to the floating production storage and offloading (fpso) market. the company is expecting to bag new fpso contracts this year, said ong. another o&g firm to watch is sapurakencana petroleum bhd, he pointed out. he added that funds around the globe are paying attention to the stock given the firm is the largest tender sea drill operator in the world. sapurakencana had secured petronas pan malaysia integrated hook-up & commissioning and topside major maintenance contract. this is significant, said ong. furthermore, ong said alam maritim resources bhd, barakah offshore petroleum bhd and perdana petroleum bhd are mid-cap stocks to watch given their higher re-rating potential. according to bloomberg data, bumi armada trades at a price earnings ratio (per) of 25.86 times while sapurakencana trades at per of 31.15 times. this compares to the fbm klcis per of 17.62 times. alam

asian share markets fell yesterday as japanese shares slid from a 5u00bd year high. regional bond risks rose as chinas inflation eased and producer prices extended declines, adding to the signs that the economy is weakening. the us dollar climbed before the jobs data was due last night.  expectation that the initial jobless claims would fall caused the american markets to ease off on wednesday night. the sp500 lost 0.27 points to close at 1,837.61 points whilst the dow fell 68.2 points to end at 16,462.74. the fbm klci traded in a sideways range of 15.4 points for the week with volumes of 1.6 billion to 1.96 billion shares done. the index closed at 1,828.21 yesterday, down 3.09 points from the previous day as blue-chip stocks like ioi corp bhd, sime darby bhd, axiata group bhd, cimb bank bhd and tenaga nasional bhd caused the index to decline on profit taking activities yesterday. the index rose on a rally from the 801.27 low (october 2008) to the previous 1,826.22 all-time high (may 2013) and it represented an extended elliott wave flat rebound in a pseudo-bull rise completed. the index price movements in the next few months following may 2013 were trapped in a rangy consolidation with key swings of 1,723.74 (low), 1,811.65 (high), 1,660.39 (low), 1,805.15 (high), 1,759.66 (low) and 1,882.2 (high). the indexs daily signals are mixed. the cci and macd are negative while the dmi, oscillator and stochastic are positive. as such, the indexs obvious support levels are seen at the 1,780, 1,800 and 1,822 levels, whilst the resistance areas of 1,828, 1,849 and all-time high of 1,882 will witness some heavy profit-taking activities. our upside targets of 1,898, 1,900 and 1,924 for the index in the medium term may be deferred for now. its simple moving averages (ma) depict a double time frame (weekly and monthly) uptrend for now. its daily chart has turned into a neutral position in january 2014. due to its mixed signals, we believe investors may adopt a range trading philosophy as the klci remains at fairly lofty levels with bearish divergent signals. as such, profit-taking on index components as well as small to mid caps may persist into the next fortnight. despite the lofty tone of the klci, we are recommending a chart buy on mkh bhd, which is a rm1.1 billion market cap company with a return on equity of 12% based on its 12-month trailing earnings. the stock made a new recent high of rm3.27 in tandem with the improving sentiment of the small and mid cap property stocks. it seems that the recent recurring theme from the property segment is the asset revaluation approach, where investors favour property companies with strategic landbank with development potential.  the firm rise in the stock price can be attributed to investors optimism on its strong earnings trend led by the plantation and property and construction division. for the fourth quarter of financial year 2013 ended sept 30, mkhs group revenue rose 21%. the rise was attributed to its plantation divisions higher sales of crude palm oil and palm kernel, as well as the property and construction divisions revenue from ongoing and new developments. despite the better profitability, profit before tax was lower due to an inclusion of foreign exchange losses in the current quarter totalling rm63 million due to a weakening rupiah and ringgit against the us dollar. maybank-ib does not have fundamental coverage on mkh. a check on bloomberg consensus revealed that three brokers have coverage on the stock, with all having a buy call on the stock.  the stock is currently trading at a reasonable historical price-earnings ratio of 10 times and a price-to-book value of 1.2 times. mkhs indicated dividend yield is at 3.14%. its chart trends on the daily, weekly and monthly timeframes are very strong indeed. its share price made an obvious surge since its monthly wave-2 low of 57 sen in october 2008. since that 57 sen low, mkh surged to its recent january 2014 high of rm3.27.  its chart has moved into very strong daily, weekly and monthly uptrends to the recent high of rm3.27. as it broke above its recent key critical resistances of rm2.62 and rm2.85, look to buy mkh on any dips to its support areas as the moving averages depict very firm short to long term uptrends for this stock.  the daily, weekly and monthly indicators (like the cci, dmi, macd and oscillator) are very strong and now depict the obvious indications of mkhs eventual surge to higher levels. we expect mkh to remain very firm towards its support levels of rm2.62, rm2.85 and rm3.10.  it will attract minor profit taking at the resistance levels of rm3.27, rm3.58 and rm4.13. its upside targets are now located at rm3.45, rm3.76, rm4.09 and rm4.22. this

price: rm1.30 neutral rhb research (nov 11): csc steels 3qfy13 net earnings of rm2.9 million (down 52.8% y-o-y) were below estimates. this was due to lower sales, depressed selling prices and high distribution expenses.  earnings for the nine months ended september, 2013, make up only 65% of our fy13 estimates.  the market is still dogged by oversupply issues, particularly chinas crude steel. the imbalance will be difficult to address, if chinas steel output remains high. it was reported that steel supply reached 65.4 million tonnes, up 11% y-o-y in september, 2013.  we anticipate the

petroleum (sakp) has reportedly emerged as a front runner for the deepwater and heavy-lift packages.  the other contender for these packages is singapores swiber offshore. however, sakp is said to have the edge over swiber, given petronas local preference policy. these contracts have already been factored into our estimates, as sakp has been the key contractor for malaysian installation work since 2008. based on the rates indicated by petronas, we estimate packages c, d and e can be worth rm3 billion to rm3.5 billion, assuming a three-year term. this is less than sakps previous contract sum of rm4.5 billion, for four packages awarded in 2008.  despite the smaller contract value, we expect margins to be better this time around, as the groups vessels working on the job will be wholly-owned. we maintain our strong buy call on sakp, with a view to raise earnings estimates. scientex bhdtarget price: rm6.28 outperform kenanga research (nov 12): on nov 11, 2013, scientex announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire the entire stake in seacera polyfilms sdn bhd  a manufacturer of biaxially-oriented polypropylene (bopp) films, which are used for packaging.  we are positive about the proposed acquisition, as it will enable scientex to venture into an essential component of the consumer packaging product industry, and to gain a larger share of the market.  based on the announcement, seacera polyfilms recorded a revenue of rm44.5 million and a net profit of rm500,000, for the year ended dec 31, 2012.  however, we understand that the low net profit was due to management fees owed to seacera group, which will be reversed under the share sale agreement. on this basis, seacera polyfilms net profit is actually rm2.8 million, implying a per of 14.3 times. we remain positive about scientexs ongoing expansion plans and earnings potential.  maintain target price of rm6.28, based on the blended sop valuation.ytl power international bhdtarget price: rm2.55 outperform cimb research (nov 11): we maintain our outperform call on ytl power, with an unchanged sop-based target price of rm2.55. we believe, the news that ytl power submitted the lowest bid for project 3b, will put the company on investors radar again.  the rerating catalyst will be the announcement of ytl power, securing the contract for project 3b, which is expected to be known by early 2014. assuming ytl power wins the bid, this will provide the group with consistent cash flows from 2018 onwards, and will supplement its current stable businesses. although the dividends can be called into question, given the high capex required for the project, we believe ytl power can ring-fence the construction cost, because of the strong and stable cash flow of the plant. stronger cash flows from the project, will likely translate into bigger dividends in the long term. furthermore, the return of ytl power to the independent power producer scene, implies that there may be more major contracts ahead.guinness anchor bhdtarget price: rm17.50 neutral cimb research (nov 10): guinness anchor bhd (gab) saw its 1qfy14 net profit fall 13% y-o-y, to rm49.6 million. the poor result was due to the drag from the planned reduction in distributor stocks, and weaker consumer spending in anticipation of subsidy cuts and the goods and services tax under budget 2014.  we believe it was also due to less aggressive advertising and promotion (a&p) activities in 1qfy14, as well as pre-budget stockpiling by retailers. we cut our fy14-16 net profit forecasts by 4% to 8%, after lowering our sales expectations by 7%. our dividend discount model-based target price, is reduced correspondingly. although gabs valuation is unattractive, its 4% to 4.5% dividend yield will lend support to its share price.  we think competition will remain intense going forward, as carlsberg has also been investing heavily in a&p, in the past few months. to remain competitive, gab will continue to invest in brand line extension. it will launch several new brands in fy14, especially in the super premium and premium beer categories. petronas chemicals bhdtarget price: rm6.15 hold hwangdbs vickers research (nov 11): following petronas chemicals 3qfy13 results conference call, we understand that the groups olefins and derivatives segment recorded lower plant utilisation of 77.6%, mainly due to heavier-than-usual maintenance at its main cracker and downstream-related facilities. similarly, the fertiliser and methanol segments plant utilisation rate dropped to 62.3%, from 80.3% in 2q13, as a result of unplanned shutdown at its methanol plant, stemming from technical issues related to gas quality and equipment concerns. these issues have since been addressed. the methanol plant will likely remain idle until the end of year 2013, coinciding with the upstream shutdown. to date, project samur has incurred 45% of its capital expenditure, and is on track for commissioning in 2015. the final investment decision for the basf aroma complex, is expected by year-end. we expect the company to improve its performance come 2014. datasonic group bhdtarget price: rm10.51 buy rhb research (nov 12): datasonic received an extension of contract worth rm182.8 million, to supply 10 million raw mykads to be delivered in december 2013, on top of the rm73.1 million contract to supply four million new mykads awarded by the national registration department in 2011.  sources indicate that the government is looking to place orders for 10 million more new cards worth rm180 million to rm190 million, in 1qfy14, to curb identity fraud-related crimes. in 2012, datasonic won a rm284.7 million contract to supply photo pages for 10 million passports, over five years. it started supplying the sheets in 3qfy13, and management indicated an annual run rate of 2.4 million to 2.5 million copies.  we forecast that datasonic will more than double its net profit to rm76.7 million, by fy13. we foresee the groups bottom line breaching the rm100 million threshold in fy15, after taking into account the potential replenishment of 10 million new mykads, and likely margins enhancement, after the completion of its new mykad assembly plant by end-fy13.ammb holdings bhdtarget price: rm7.89 neutral alliance research (nov 12): local dailies reported that amfraser securities pte ltd, a wholly-owned brokerage unit of ammb, is believed to have financial exposure of close to s$150 million (rm384.6 million), related to the recent share price collapse of blumont group ltd, liongold corp ltd and asiasons capital ltd, listed on the singapore exchange.  we have not adjusted our earnings estimates, in view of the uncertainties and complexity of the issue. besides that, it remains to be seen how much of such financial exposure is being collateralised. on a positive note, our recent correspondence with the management of ammb, indicated that the incident does not have a significant impact on the groups fy14 earnings.  we are maintaining our neutral call for the group, with an unchanged target price of rm7.89. our target price implied a 1.7 times 2014 price-to-book ratio and 15% return on equity, based on our gordon growth valuation model. westports holdings bhd target price: rm2.70 buy  maybank investment (nov 12): we expect 4qfy13 earnings to be boosted by the seasonally stronger volume from the christmas-related trade and a substantially lower effective tax rate, as the group starts to enjoy tax holiday for the new wharf under container terminal 7. we note that 4qfy12 net profit accounted for 38% of westports full-year fy12 earnings. we recently met up with cma cgm  westports biggest client, to assess the implications of the proposed p3 alliance on westports. the key takeaways are: (i) net volume loss at westports could be only 175,000 teus per annum or 2% of westports total volume, as cma cgm introduces new non-p3 services from 1hfy14 onwards; and (ii) cma cgm will remain committed to hubbing at westports. taking into consideration the p3-related volume loss and growth from the non-p3 business, we project a container throughput growth of 7% (fy13), 6% (fy14) and 8% (fy15). given its dividend payout policy of 75%, we project a net dividend yield of 4.1% for fy14.mah sing group bhd fair value: rm3.80 buy  amresearch (nov 11): we consider the nine months results to be in line, constituting 75% of our full-year estimates and 73% of consensus.  mah sings unbilled sales stood at a sturdy rm4.2 billion (2.7 times fy12 property revenue). the group is on track to achieve its fy13f new sales target of rm3 billion, having secured close to rm2.3 billion for 9mfy13. key projects are [emailprotected], m residence 1 & 2, m city, as well as mah sing i-parc.  we expect mah sing to potentially lock in around rm718 million for the pre-selected units in dsara sentral and savannas initial launches. the strong take-up rates achieved for both projects, come without developer interest bearing scheme incentives. mah sings future launches will focus on larger township projects offering affordable products, notably landed residential units or apartments with initial price points of below rm500,000.  nestle (m) bhdtarget price: rm72.80 market outperform kenanga research (nov 12): nescafe has a strong market share of more than 70% in the local market, where consumption of coffee is still considered at the lower-end of 120 cups per capita.  a survey also showed that coffee contributed only 9% to the overall beverage market, hinting at more room for growth. ytd, nescafes volume growth outperformed that of the overall coffee market.  we continue to see vast growth opportunities, driven by nestles product innovation, marketing investments and capacity expansion. including the construction of a new plant, nestle management has guided a capex of rm250 million for fy13e. we estimate net gearing for fy13e will be reduced slightly, from 0.38 times to 0.32 times. construction of the new plant is on schedule and will commence operations in the middle of 2014. due to the minor changes in the fixed assets, as a result of the capex adjustment, our net profit forecast is edged slightly higher by 0.1% to 0.2%, for fy13e and fy14e, from rm544.3 million-rm588.6 million to rm545.1 million-rm589.5 million.boustead heavyindustries corp bhdfair value: rm3.80 buy amresearch (nov 12): bhics 51%-owned contraves advanced devices sdn bhd (cad) has been awarded a contract by its 21%-owned boustead naval shipyard sdn bhd (bns), to supply the torpedo launching system for the second-generation littoral combat ship (lcs) programme. currently, cad has already secured rm2.5 billion in subcontract works from bns. this represents 30% of the confirmed rm9 billion lcs contract value, that was awarded to bns. including the torpedo launching system, we believe that the total value of cads subcontracts could reach rm3 billion.  we expect the earnings contribution from these lcs subcontract works to be progressively recognised throughout the 10-year delivery period. hence, we maintain bhics fy13f to fy15f earnings, on expectations of a significant y-o-y surge in 4qfy13 earnings, as bns has yet to recognise progress billings from the lcs contract to date.  the stock currently trades at an attractive fy14f per of only six times, 70% below singapore technologies engineering ltds current valuation. this story first appeared in the edge weekly edition of nov 18-24, 2013."}}
